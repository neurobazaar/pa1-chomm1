CHAPTER I

THE PERFECT BOARDING HOUSE


It is queer but Captain Cy himself doesnt remember whether the day was
Tuesday or Wednesday Asaph Tidditts records ought to settle it for
there was a meeting of the board of selectmen that day and Asaph has
been town clerk in Bayport since the summer before the Baptist meeting
house burned But on the record the date in Asaphs handwriting stands
Tuesday May 10 189 and as it happens May 10 of that year fell on
Wednesday not Tuesday at all

Keturah Bangs who keeps the perfect boarding house says it was
Tuesday because she remembers they had fried cod cheeks and cabbage
that dayas they have every Tuesdayand neither Mr Tidditt nor Bailey
Bangs Keturahs husband was on hand when the dinner bell rang Keturah
says she is certain it was Tuesday because she remembers smelling the
boiled cabbage as she stood at the side door looking up the road to
see if either Asaph or Bailey was coming As for Bailey he says he
remembers being late to dinner and his wifes startin to heave a
broadsides into him because of it but he doesnt remember what day it
was This isnt surprising Keturahs verbal cannonades are likely to
make one forgetful of trifles

At any rate whether Tuesday or Wednesday it is certain that it was
quarter past twelve according to the clock presented to the Methodist
Society by the Honorable Heman Atkins when Asaph Tidditt came down the
steps of the townhall after the selectmens meeting and saw Bailey
Bangs waiting for him on the opposite side of the road

Hello Ase hailed Mr Bangs Youll be late to dinner if you dont
hurry I was headin for home all sail sot when I see you What kept
you

Town business of course replied Mr Tidditt with the importance
pertaining to his official position What kept YOU for the land sakes
Wont Ketury be in your wool

Bailey hasnt any wool worth mentioning now and he had very little
more then but he mopped his forehead or the extension above it taking
off his cap to do so

I callate she will he said uneasily Tell you the truth Ase
I was up to the store and Capn Josiah Dimick and some more of
em drifted in and we got talkin about the chances of the harbor
appropriation and one thing or nother and twas latern I thought
twas fore I knew it

The appropriation from the government which was to deepen and widen our
harbor here at Bayport was a very vital topic among us just then Heman
Atkins the congressman from our district had promised to do his best
for the appropriation and had for a time been very sanguine of securing
it Recently however he had not been quite as hopeful

Whats Capn Josiah think about the chances asked Asaph eagerly

Well sometimes he thinks Yes and then again he thinks No replied
Bailey He says of course if Heman is able to get it he will but if
he aint able to hehe

He wont I spose Well _I_ can think that myself and I dont set
up to be no inspired knowitall like Joe Dimick He aint heard from
Heman lately has he

No he aint Neithers anybody else so fur as I can find out

Oh yes they have _I_ have for one

Mr Bangs stopped short in his doublequick march for home and dinner
and looked his companion in the face

Ase Tidditt he cried Do you mean to tell me youve had a letter
from Heman Atkins from Washinton

Asaph nodded portentously

Yes sir he declared A letter from the Honorable Heman G Atkins
of Washinton D C come to me last night I read it afore I turned
in

You did And never said nothin about it

Why should I say anything about it Twas addressed to me as town
clerk and was concernin a matter to be took up with the board of
slectmen I aint in the habit of hollerin town affairs through a
speakin trumpet Folks that vote for me townmeetin day know that I
guess Angie Phinney says to me only yesterday Mr Tidditt says she
theres one thing Ill say for youyou dont talk

Miss Phinney boarded with the Bangses and Bailey was acquainted with
her personal peculiarities for that matter so were most of Bayports
permanent residents

Humph he snorted indignantly She thought twas a good thing not
to talk hey SHE did Well by mighty you never get no CHANCE to talk
when shes around Angie Phinney Why when that poll parrot of hers
died Alphus Smalley declared up and down that what killed it was
jealousy and disappinted ambition he said it broke its heart tryin to
keep up with Angie Her ma was the same breed of cats I remember

The talking proclivities of females is the one topic upon which
Keturahs husband is touchiest Asaph knew this but he delighted to
stir up his chum occasionally He chuckled as he interrupted the flow of
reminiscence

There there Bailey he exclaimed I know as much about Angies
tribe as you do I callate Aint we a little mite off the course
Seems to me we was talkin about Hemans letter

Is that so I judged from what you said we want goin to talk about
it Aw dont be so mean Ase Showin off your importance like a young
one What did Heman say about the appropriation Is he goin to get it

Mr Tidditt paused before replying Then bending over he whispered in
his chums ear

He never said one word about the appropriation Bailey not one word
He wanted to know if wed got this years taxes on the Whittaker place
And if we hadnt what was we goin to do about it Bailey between you
and me and the mizzenmast Heman Atkins wants to get ahold of that place
the worst way

He does He DOES For the land sakes aint he got property enough
already Aint aa palace like that enough for one man without wantin
to buy a rattletrap like THAT

The first that was emphasized by a brandished but reverent left hand
the second by a derisively pointing right The two friends had reached
the crest of the long slope leading up from the townhall On one side
of the road stretched the imposing frontage of the Atkins estate with
its iron fence and stone posts on the other slouched the weedgrown
tumbledown desolation of the Cy Whittaker place The contrast was
that of opulent prosperity and povertystricken neglect

If our village boasted one of those horseless juggernauts such as are
used to carry sightseers in Boston from the old North Church to the
Public Library and other points of interestthat is if there was a
seeing Bayport car it is from this hill that its occupants would be
given their finest view of the village and its surroundings As Captain
Josiah Dimick always says Bayport is all north and south like a
codfish line It puts me in mind of Seth Higginss oldest boy He was so
tall and thin that when they bought a suit of clothes for him they used
to take reefs in the sides of the jacket and use the cloth to piece onto
the bottoms of the trousers legs What Captain Joe means is that
the houses in the village are all built beside three roads running
longitudinally There is the main road and the upper roador
Woodchuck Lane just as you preferand the lower road otherwise
known as Bassetts Holler

The upper road is sometimes called the depot road because the
railroad station is conveniently located thereonconvenient for the
railroad that isthe station being a full mile from Simmonss general
store which is considered the center of the town The upper road
enters the main road at the corner by the store and there also are
the Methodist meetinghouse and the schoolhouse The townhall is in the
hollow farther on Then comes the big hill

Whittakers Hilland from the top of this hill you can on a clear
day see for miles across the salt marshes and over the bay to the
eastward and west as far as the church steeple in Orham If there
happens to be a fog with a strong easterly wind you cannot see the
marshes or the bay but you can smell them wet and salty and sweet It
is a smell that the born Bayporter never forgets but carries with him
in memory wherever he goes and that in the palmy days of the merchant
marine was likely to be far for every male baby in the village was
born with web feet so people said and was predestined to be a sailor

When Heman Atkins came back from the South Seas early in the 60s
rich as dock mud though still a young man he promptly tore down his
fathers old house which stood on the crest of Whittakers Hill and
built in its place a big imposing residence It was by far the finest
house in Bayport and Heman made it finer as the years passed There
were imitation brownstone pillars supporting its front porch iron dogs
and scroll work iron benches bordering its front walk and a pair of
stone urns in summer filled with flowers beside its big iron front
gate

Heman was our leading citizen our representative in Washington and the
towns philanthropist He gave the Atkins memorial window and the Atkins
tower clock to the Methodist Church The Atkins town pump also his
gift stood before the townhall The Atkins portrait in the Bayport
Ladies Library was much admired and the size of the Atkins fortune was
the principal subject of conversation at sewing circle at the table of
the perfect boarding house around the stove in Simmonss store or
wherever Bayporters were used to gather We never exactly worshipped
Heman Atkins perhaps but we figuratively doffed our hats when his name
was mentioned

The Cy Whittaker place faced the Atkins estate from the opposite side
of the main road but it was the general opinion that it ought to be
ashamed to face it Almost everybody called it the Cy Whittaker place
although some of the younger set spoke of it as the Sea Sight House
It was a big oldfashioned dwelling gambrelroofed and brown and
dilapidated Originally it had enjoyed the dignified seclusion afforded
by a white picket fence with square gateposts and the path to its
seldomused front door had been guarded by rigid lines of box hedge
This however was years ago before the second Captain Cy Whittaker
died and before the Howes family turned it into the Sea Sight House
a hotel for summer boarders

The Howeses improved the house and grounds They tore down the picket
fence uprooted the box hedges hung a sign over the sacred front door
and built a wide veranda under the parlor windows

They took boarders for five consecutive summers then they gave up the
unprofitable undertaking returned to Concord New Hampshire their
native city and left the Cy Whittaker place to bear the ravages of
Bayport winters and Bayport small boys as best it might

For years it stood empty The weeds grew high about its foundations the
sparrows built nests behind such of its shutters as had not been ripped
from their hinges by February notheasters its roof grew bald in spots
as the shingles loosened and were blown away the swallows flew in and
out of its stonebroken windowpanes Year by year it became more of a
disgrace in the eyes of Bayports neat and thrifty inhabitantsfor neat
and thrifty we are if we do say it The selectmen would have liked
to tear it down but they could not because it was private property
having been purchased from the Howes heirs by the third Cy Whittaker
Captain Cys only son who ran away to sea when he was sixteen years
old and was disinherited and cast off by the proud old skipper in
consequence Each March Asaph Tidditt in his official capacity as town
clerk had been accustomed to receive an envelope with a South American
postmark and in that envelope was a draft on a Boston banking house for
the sum due as taxes on the Cy Whittaker place The drafts were signed
Cyrus M Whittaker

But this particular yearthe year in which this chronicle beginsno
draft had been received Asaph waited a few weeks and then wrote to the
address indicated by the postmark His letter was unanswered The taxes
were due in March and it was now May Mr Tidditt wrote again then he
laid the case before the board of selectmen and Captain Eben Salters
chairman of that august body also wrote But even Captain Ebens
authoritative demand was ignored Next to the harbor appropriation the
question of what should be done about the Cy Whittaker place filled
Bayports thoughts that spring No one however had supposed that
the Honorable Heman might wish to buy it Bailey Bangss surprise was
excusable

What in the world repeated Bailey does Heman want of a shebang like
that Aint he got enough already

His friend shook his head

Pears not he said I judge its this way Bailey Heman hes a
proud man

Well aint he got a right to be proud broke in Mr Bangs hastening
to resent any criticism of the popular idol Callate you and med be
proud if we was able to carry as much sail as he does wouldnt we

Yes I guess like we would But you neednt get red in the face and
strain your biler just because I said that I aint finding fault with
Heman Im only tellin you Hes proud as I said and his wife

Shes dead this four year What are you resurrectin her for

Land youre peppery as a West Injy omelet this mornin Let me alone
till Ive finished His wife when she was alive she was proud too
And his daughter Alicia shes eight year old now and by and by shell
be grown up into a hightoned young woman Well Heman is fursighted
and I spose likely hes thinkin of the days when therell be young
rich fellerssenators andandwell counts and lords maybecruisin
down here courtin her By that time the Whittaker placell be a worse
disgrace than tis now I presume he dont want those swells to sit on
his front piazza and see the crows buildin nests in the ruins acrost
the road So

Crows Did you ever see a crow build a nest in a house I never did

Oh belay Crows or canary birds what difference does it make
SOMETHIN ll nest there if its only Ant Sophrony Halletts hens
So Heman he writes to the board askin if the taxes is paid if weve
heard any reason why they aint paid and what were goin to do about
it If theres a sale for taxes he wants to be fust bidder Then when
the place is his he can tear down or rebuild just as he sees fit
See

Yes I see Well I feel about that the way Joe Dimick felt when he
heard the doctor had told Elviry Pepper she must stop singin in
the choir or lose her voice altogether Whichever happens ll be an
improvement says Capn Joe and whatever Heman does ll help the
Whittaker place What did you decide at the meetin

Nothin We cant decide yet We aint sure about the law and we want
to wait a spell anyhow But I know how twill end Atkins ll get the
place He always gets what he wants Heman does

Bailey turned and looked back at the old house forlorn amidst
its huddle of blackberry briers and weeds and with the ubiquitous
silverleaf saplings springing up in clusters everywhere about it and
closing in on its defenseless walls like squads of victorious soldiery
making the final charge upon a conquered fort

Well sighed Mr Bangs so that ll be the end of the old Whittaker
place hey Sho things change in a fellers lifetime dont they You
and me can remember Ase when Capn Cy Whittaker was one of the biggest
men we had in this town So was his dad afore him the Capn Cy that
built the house I wonder the looks of things here now dont bring them
two up out of their graves Do you remember young CyWhit we used to
call himor Reddy Whit count of his red hair I dont knows you
do though guess youd gone to sea when he run away from home

Mr Tidditt shook his head

No no he said I was to home that year Remember Whit Well I
should say I did He was a holy terroryes sir Want no monkey shines
or didos cut up in this town that young Cy want into Furs that goes
you and me was in em too Bailey We was all holy terrors then Young
ones nowadays aint got the spunk we used to have

His friend chuckled

Thats so he declared Thats so Whit was a goodhearted boy too
but full of the Old Scratch and as sot in his ways as his dad and if
Capn Cy want sot then there aint no sotness Youll go to college
and be a parson says the Capn Ill go to sea and be a sailor same
as you done says Whit And he did too run away one night took the
packet to Boston and shipped aboard an Australian clipper Capn Cy
didnt go after him to fetch him home No siree not a fetch Sent
him a letter plumb to Melbourne and says he Youve made your bed now
lay in it Dont you never dast to come back to me or your ma he says
And Whit didnt he want that kind

Pretty nigh killed the old ladyWhits mathat did mused Asaph
She died a little spell afterwards And the old man pined away too
but he never give in or asked the boy to come back Stubborn as all
getout to the end he was and willed the place all he had left to
them Howes folks And a nice mess THEY made of it Young Cy he

Young Cy interrupted Bailey Were always callin him young Cy
and yet when you come to think of it he must be pretty nigh fiftyfive
now most as old as you and I be Wonder if hell ever come back here

You bet he wont was the oracular reply You bet he wont From what
I hear he got to be a sea capn himself and settled down there in Buenos
Ayres Hes made all kinds of money they say out of hides and such
What he ever bought his dads old place for _I_ cant see Hell never
come back to these common onehorse latitudes now you mark my word on
that

It was a prophecy Mr Tidditt was accustomed to make each year to the
crowd at the post office when the receipt for the draft for taxes
caused him to wax reminiscent The younger generation here in Bayport
regard their town clerk as something of an oracle and this regard has
made Asaph a trifle vain and positive

Bailey chuckled again

We WAS a spunky daredevil lot in the old days want we Ase he
said Spunk was kind of born in us as you might say And even now
were

The Atkins tower clock boomed oncea solemn dignified stroke Mr
Tidditt and his companion started and looked at each other

Godfrey scissors gasped Asaph Is that half past twelve

Mr Bangs pulled a big worn silver watch from his pocket and glanced at
the dial

It is he moaned As sures youre born it is Weve kept Keturys
dinner waitin twenty minutes You and me are in for it now Ase
Tidditt Twenty minutes late Shell skin us alive

Mr Tidditt did not pause to answer but plunged headlong down the
hill at a racehorse gait Bailey pounding at his heels For born
daredevils selfconfessed they were a nervous and apprehensive pair

The perfect boarding house is situated a quarter of a mile beyond
Whittakers Hill nearly opposite the Salters homestead The sign
hung on the pole by the front gate reads Bayport Hotel Bailey Bangs
Proprietor but no one except the stranger in Bayport accepts that sign
seriously When owing to an unexpected change in the administration
at Washington Mr Bangs was obliged to relinquish his position as our
village postmaster his wife came to the rescue with the proposal that
they open a boarding house Whatsoeer you find to do quoted Keturah
at sewingcircle meeting do it then with all your might Thats a
good Sabbathschool hymn tune and its good sense besides I intend to
make it my life work to run just as complete aa eatin and lodgin
establishment as I can If when Im laid to rest they can put onto my
gravestone She run the perfect boardin house ILL be satisfied

This remark and subsequent similar declarations were widely quoted
and therefore though casual visitors may refer to the Bayport Hotel
to us natives the Bangs residence is always Keturahs perfect boarding
house As for the signs affirmation of Mr Bangs proprietorship
that is considered the cream of the joke The idea of meek baldheaded
little Bailey posing as proprietor of anything while his wife is on
deck tickles Bayports sense of humor

The perspiring delinquents panted into the yard of the perfect boarding
house and tremblingly opened the door leading to the dining room Dinner
was well under way and Mrs Bangs enthroned at the end of the long
table behind the silverplated teapot was waiting to receive them The
silence was appalling

Sorry to be a little behindhand Ketury stammered Asaph hurriedly
Town affairs are important of course and cant be neglected I

Yes yes thats so Ketury cut in Mr Bangs

You see

Hum Yes I see Keturahs tone was several degrees below freezing
Hum I spose twas town affairs kept you too hey

Well wellernot exactly as you might say but Bailey squeezed
himself into the armchair at the end of the table opposite his wife the
end which with sarcasm not the less keen for being unintentional was
called the head Not exactly town affairs twant that kept me
Ketury butMy dont them cod cheeks smell good You always could cook
cod cheeks if I do say it

The compliment was wasted Mrs Bangs had a sermon to deliver and its
text was not cod cheeks

Bailey Bangs she began when I was brought to realize that my
husband although apparently an ablebodied man couldnt support me as
Id been used to be supported and when I was forced to support HIM
by keepin boarders I says If theres one thing that my house shall
stand for its punctual promptness at meal times I say nothing I
says about the inconvenience of gettin on with only one hired help
when we ought to have three If Providence in its unscrutable wisdom
I says has seen fit to lay this burden onto me the burden of a
household of boarders and a husband whom

And just then the power referred to by Mrs Bangs intervened to spare
her husband the remainder of the preachment From the driveway of the
yard beside the diningroom windows came the rattle of wheels and
the tramp of a horses feet Mrs Matilda Tripp who sat nearest the
windows on that side rose and peered out

Its the depot wagon Ketury she said Theres somebody inside it I
wonder if theyre comin here

Transients were almost unknown quantities at the Bayport Hotel in May
Consequently all the boarders and the landlady herself crowded to the
windows The depot wagon had drawn up by the steps and Gabe Lumley
the driver had descended from his seat and was doing his best to open
the door of the ancient vehicle It stuck of course the doors of all
depot wagons stick

Hold on a shake commanded some one inside the carriage Wait till
I get a purchase on her Now then All hands to the ropes Heaveho
THERE she comes

The door flew back with a bang A man sprang out upon the lower step of
the porch The eye of every inmate of the perfect boarding house was on
him Even the hired help peered from the kitchen door

Hes a stranger whispered Mrs Tripp I never see him before did
you Mr Tidditt

The town clerk did not answer He was staring at the depot wagons
passenger staring with a face the interested expression of which was
changing to that of surprise and amazed incredulity Mrs Tripp turned
to Mr Bangs he also was staring openmouthed

Godfrey scissors gasped Asaph under his breath GodfreySCISSORS
Bailey II believeI swan to man I believe

Ase Tidditt exclaimed Mr Bangs am I goin looney or is thatis
that

Neither finished his sentence There are times when language seems so
pitifully inadequate



CHAPTER II

THE WANDERERS RETURN


Here in Bayport nowadays the collecting of antiques is a favorite
amusement of our summer visitors Those of us who were fortunate enough
to possess a set of nicked blue dishes a warming pan or a tall clock
with wooden wheels have long ago parted with these treasures for
considerable sums Oddly enough Sylvanus Cahoon has profited most by
this craze Sylvanus used to be judged the unluckiest man in town of
late this judgment has been revised

It was Sylvanus who confined to the house by an illness brought on by
eating too much sugar cake at a free sociable given by the Methodist
Society arose in the night and drank copiously of what he supposed to
be the medicine left by the doctor It happened to be waterbug poison
and Sylvanus was nearly killed by the dose He is reported as having
admitted that he didnt mind dyin so much but hated to die such a dum
mean death

While convalescent he took to smoking in bed and was burned out of
house and home in consequence Then it was that his kindhearted fellow
citizens donated for the furnishing of his new residence all the
castoff bits of furniture and odds and ends from their garrets
Charity observed Captain Josiah Dimick at the time begins at home
with us Bayporters and it generally begins up attic that bein nighest
to heaven

Later Sylvanus sold most of the donations as antiques and made money
enough therefrom to buy a new plush parlor set Miss Angeline Phinney
never called on the Cahoons after that without making her appearance at
the front door Ill get some good out of that plush sofy I helped to
pay for declared Angeline if its only to wear it out by settin on
it

There are two antiques in Bayport which have not yet been sold or even
bid for One is Gabe Lumleys depot wagon and the other is Danl
Webster the horse which draws it Both are very ancient sadly in need
of upholstery and jerky of locomotion

Gabe was as usual waiting at the station when the down train arrived
on the Tuesdayor Wednesdayof the selectmens meeting The train was
due according to the timetable at eleven fortyfive This timetable
and the signboard of the Bayport Hotel are the only bits of humorous
literature peculiar to our village unless we add the political
editorials of the Bayport Breeze

So at eleven fortyfive Mr Lumley was serenely dozing on the baggage
truck which he had wheeled to the sunny side of the platform At five
minutes past twelve he yawned stretched and looked at his watch
Then rolling off the truck he strolled to the edge of the platform and
spoke authoritatively to Danl Webster

Hi there stand still commanded Mr Lumley

Standing still being Danls long suit the order was obeyed Gabe then
loafed to the door of the station and accosted the depot master who was
nodding in his chair beside the telegraph instrument

Where is she now Ed asked Mr Lumley referring to the train

Just left South Harniss Be here pretty soon Whats your hurry
Expectin anybody

Naw nobody that I know of special Sophrony Halletts gone to
Ostable but she wont be back till tomorrow I callate Hello there
she whistles now

Needless to say it was the train not the widow Hallett that had
whistled The depot master rose from his chair A yellow dog his
property scrambled from beneath it and rushing out of the door and
to the farther end of the platform barked furiously Cephas Baker who
lives across the road from the depot slouched down to his front gate
His wife opened the door of her kitchen and stood there her wet arms
wrapped in her apron The five Baker children tore round the corner of
the house over the back fence and lined up whooping joyously on the
platform A cloud of white smoke billowed above the clump of cedars at
the bend of the track Then the locomotive rounded the curve and bore
down upon the station

Stand still I tell you shouted Gabe addressing the horse

Danl Webster opened one eye closed it and relapsed into slumber

The train a combination baggage car and smoker two freight cars and
a passenger coach rolled ponderously alongside the platform From the
open door of the baggage car were tossed the mail sack and two express
packages The conductor stepped from the passenger coach Following
him came briskly a short thickset man with a reddishgray beard and
grayishred hair

Goin down to the village Mister inquired Mr Lumley Carriage
right here

The stranger inspected the driver of the depot wagon inspected him
deliberately from top to toe Then he said

Down to the village Why yes I wouldnt wonder Say youre a Lumley
aint you

Why whyyes I be Howd you know that Aint ever seen you afore
have I

Guess not with a quiet chuckle Ive never seen you either but
Ive seen your nose Id know a Lumley nose if I run across it in
China

The possessor of the Lumley nose rubbed that organ in a bewildered
fashion Recovering in a measure he laughed rather halfheartedly and
begged to know if the trunk then being unloaded from the baggage car
belonged to his prospective passenger As the answer was an affirmative
nod he secured the trunk check and departed still rubbing his nose

When he returned with the trunk on the truck he found the stranger
with his hands in his pockets standing before Danl Webster and gazing
at that animal with an expression of acute interest

Is this yourhorse demanded the newcomer pausing before the final
word of his question

Its so callated to be replied Gabe with dignity

Hum Does he work nights

Work nights No course he dont

Oh all right Then you can wake him up with a clear conscience I
didnt know but he needed the sleep Whats his record

Record

Yup his trottin record Anybody can see hes built for speed narrow
in the beam and sharp fore and aft Shall I get aboard the barouche

The depot master who was on hand to help with the trunk grinned
broadly Mr Lumley sulkily made answer that his passenger might get
aboard if he wanted to Apparently he wanted to for he sprang into the
depot wagon with a bounce that made the old vehicle rock on its springs

Jerushy he exclaimed she rolls some dont she Never mind MY
ballast ll keep her on an even keel Trunk made fast astern All
right Say you might furl some of this spare canvas sos I can take
an observation as we go along Dont go so fast that the scenery gets
blurred will you Its been some time since I made this cruise and Id
rather like to keep a lookout

The driver furled the canvasthat is he rolled up the curtains at
the sides of the carryall Then he climbed to the front seat and took up
the reins

Git up he shouted savagely Danl Webster did not move

The passenger offered a suggestion Why dont you try hangin an alarm
clock in his foreriggin he asked

Haw haw roared the depot master

Git up youyou lump bellowed the harassed Mr Lumley Danl pricked
up one ear then a hoof and slowly got under way As the equipage
passed the Baker homestead the whole family was clustered about the
gate staring at the occupant of the wagon The stare was returned

Who lives in there demanded the stranger Who are those folks

Ceph Bakers tribe was the sullen answer

Baker hey Humph new folks I presume likely Used to be Seth Snows
house that did Whered Seth go to

Gabe grunted that he did not know He believed Mr Snow was dead had
died years before

Humph dead hey Then I know where he went Do you ever smokeor does
drivin this horse make you too nervous

Mr Lumley thawed a bit at the sight of the proffered cigar He admitted
that he smoked occasionally and that he guessed twouldnt interfere
with the drivin none

Good enough then well light up I can talk better if Im under a head
of steam Theres a new house who built that

The new house was fifteen years old but Gabe gave the name of its
builder Then thinking that the catechising had been altogether too
onesided he ventured an observation of his own

This is a pretty good cigar Mister he said Smokes like a
Snowflake

Like a what

Like a Snowflake Thats about the best straight five center you can
get around here Simmons used to keep em but the drummers cart aint
called lately and hes all out

Thats a shame I told the train boy that these smoked like somethin
but I didnt know what to call it Much obliged to you Heres another
put it in your pocket Oh no thanks pleasures all mine Whos
Simmons

Gabe described the Simmons general store and its proprietor Then he
added

I was noticin that trunk of yours mister its all plastered over
with labels aint it Callate that trunks done some travelin hey

Think so do you

Yup Gee Id like to travel myself But no I got to stay all my life
in this dead n alive hole I wanted to go to Boston and clerk in
a store but the old man put his foot down and here Ive stuck ever
sence Git up Danl Whats the matter with you

The passenger smiled but there was a dreamy look in his gray eyes

Dont find fault son he said Theres worse places in the world
than old Bayport and worse judgment than mindin your dad Dont forget
that or you may be sorry for it some day He sniffed eagerly Ah he
exclaimed just smell that will you Aint that FINE

Humph thats the flats You can smell em any time when the tides out
and the winds right You see the tide goes out pretty fur here and

Dont I know it Son Ive been waitin thirty odd year for that smell
and here tis at last Drive slow and let me fill up on it Just blow
thatthat Snowstorm of yours the other way for a spell wont you
Thanks

The request to be driven slow was so superfluous that Mr Lumley paid
no attention to it He puffed industriously at the Snowflake and watched
his companion who leaning forward on the seat was gazing out at
the town and the bay beyond it The depot hill is not as high as
Whittakers Hill but the view is almost as extensive

Excuse me Mister observed Gabe after an interval but you aint
said where youre goin

The passenger came out of his day dream with a start

Why thats right he exclaimed So I havent Well now where would
you go if you was me Is there a hotel or tavern or somethin

Yup Theres the Bayport Hotel Taint exactly a hotel neither We
call it the perfect boardin house round here You see

He proceeded to tell the story of the perfect boarding house His
listener seemed greatly interested and although he laughed did not
interrupt until the tale was ended

So he said chuckling Bailey Bangs hey Stub Bangs Well well
And he married Ketury Payson How in time did he ever find spunk enough
to propose And Ketury runs the perfect boardin house Well that ought
to be job enough for one woman She runs Bailey too on the side I
spose

You bet you He dont dast to say boo to a chicken when shes round
I say Mister I dont knows I know your name do I I judge youve
been here afore so

Yes Ive been here before Whose is that big place up there across our
bows The one with the cupola on the main truck

That sir said Mr Lumley oratorically belongs to the Honorable
Heman G Atkins and its probably the finest in this county Heman is
our representative in Washinton andDid you say anything

The passenger had said something but he did not repeat it He was
leaning from the carriage and gazing steadily up the slope ahead
And his gaze strange to say was not directed at the imposing Atkins
estate but at its opposite neighbor the old Cy Whittaker place

Slowly laboriously Danl Webster mounted the hill At the crest he
would have paused to take breath but the driver would not let him

Git along you he commanded flapping the reins

And then Mr Lumley suffered the shock of a surprise The hitherto cool
and selfpossessed occupant of the rear seat seemed very much excited
His big red hand clasped Mr Lumleys over the reins and Danl was
brought to an abrupt standstill

Heave to he ordered sharply and the tone was that of one who has
given many orders and expects them to be obeyed Belay Whoa there
Great land of love look at that LOOK at it Who did that

The mate to the big red hand pointed to the front door of the Whittaker
place Gabe was alarmed

Done what Done which he gasped What you talkin about There aint
nobody lives in there That house has been empty for

Wheres the front fence demanded the excited passenger Whats
become of the hedge And who put up thatthat darned piazza

The piazza had been where it now was almost since Mr Lumley could
remember He hastened to reply that he didnt know he wasnt sure
he presumed likely twas them New Hampshire Howeses when they ran a
summer boarding house

The stranger drew a long breath Well of all the he began Then
he choked hesitated and ordered his driver to heave ahead and run
alongside the hotel as quick as the Almighty would let him Gabe
hastened to obey He was now absolutely certain that his companion was
an escaped lunatic and the sooner another keeper was appointed the
better The remainder of the trip was made in silence

Mrs Bangs opened the door of the perfect boarding house and stood
majestically waiting to receive the prospective guest Over her
shoulders peered the faces of the boarders

Good afternoon began the landlady I presume likely you would like
to

She was interrupted The newcomer turned toward her and extended his
hand

Hello Ketury he said I aint seen you sence you wore your hair
up but youre just as goodlookin as ever And aint that Bailey Yes
tis and Asaph too How are you boys Shake

Mr Bangs and his chum the town clerk had emerged from the doorway
Their mouths and eyes were wide open and they seemed to be suffering
from a sort of paralysis

Well Whats the matter with you demanded the arrival Aint too
stuck up to shake hands after all these years are you

Baileys mouth closed in order that its possessor might swallow Then
it slowly reopened

I swan to man he ejaculated WELL I swan to man II blieve
youre Cy Whittaker

Course I am Have to dye my carrot top if I want to play anybody else
But look here boys you answer my question who had the cheek to rig
up that blasted piazza on my house It starts to come down tomorrow
mornin



CHAPTER III

FIXIN OVER


Miss Angeline Phinney made no less than nine calls that afternoon
Before bedtime it was known from the last house in Woodchuck Lane to
the fish shanties at West Bayport that young Cy Whittaker had come
back that he had come back for good that he was staying temporarily
at the perfect boarding house that he was awful well offhaving made
lots of money down in South America that he intended to fix over
the Whittaker place and that it was to be fixed over not in a modern
manner with plush parlor setsa la Sylvanus Cahoonnor with onyx
tables and blue and gold chairs like those adorning the Atkins mansion
It was to be as near as possible a reproduction of what it had been in
the time of the late Capn Cy young Cys father

_I_ think hes out of his head declared Miss Phinney in confidence
to each of the nine females whom she favored with her calls Not crazy
you understand but sort of touched in the upper story I says so to
Matildy Tripp said it right out too Matildy I says hes got a
screw loose up aloft just as sure as youre a born woman What makes
you think so says she Well says I do you spose anybody that
want foolish would be for spendin good money on an old house to
make it OLDER I says Goin to tear down the piazza the fust thing
Perfectly good piazza that cost ninetyeight dollars and sixty cents to
build I know because I see the bill when the Howeses had it done And
hes goin to set out box hedges somethin that aint been the style
in this town sence Congressman Atkins pulled up his What in the world
Capn Whittaker says I to him do you want of box hedges Homely
and stiff and funeral lookin I might have em around my grave in the
buryin ground I says but nowheres else All right Angie says
he you shall have em there Ill cut some slips purpose for you
Itll be a pleasure he says Now aint that crazy talk for a grown
man

Miss Phinney was not the only one in our village to question Captain
Cy Whittakers sanity during the next few months The majority of
our people didnt understand him at all He was generally liked for
although he had money he did not put on airs but he had his own way of
doing things and they were not Bayport ways

True to his promise he had a squad of carpenters busy on the
day following his arrival tearing down the loathed piazza These
carpenters and more were kept busy throughout that entire spring
and well into the summer Then came painters and gardeners The piazza
disappeared a new picket fence exactly like the old one torn down by
the Howeses was erected new shutters were hung new windowpanes were
set the roof was newly shingled Captain Cy Senior had in his day
cherished a New England fondness for white and green paint therefore
the new fence was white and the house was white and the blinds a
brilliant green Rows of box hedge the plants brought from Boston were
set out on each side of the front walk The Howes frontdoor bella
clamorous gongwas removed and a glass knob attached to a spring bell
of the oldfashioned jingle variety took its place An oldfashioned
flower gardenCapn Cys mother had loved posieswas laid out on
the west lawn beyond the pear trees All these changes the captain
superintended when they were complete he turned his attention to
interior decoration

And now Captain Cy proceeded to literally astonish the natives Among
the Howes improvements were gilt wall papers and modern furniture for
the lower floor of the house The furniture they had taken with them
the wall paper had perforce been left behind And the captain had every
scrap of that paper stripped from the walls and the latter recovered
with quaint ugly oldfashioned patterns stripes and roses and
flowered sprays with impossible birds flitting among them The Bassett
decorators has pasted the gilt improvement over the old Whittaker paper
and it was the Whittaker paper that the captain did his best to match
sending samples here there and everywhere in the effort Then upon
the walls he hung oldfashioned pictures such as Bayport dwellers had
long ago relegated to their attics pictures like From Shore to Shore
Christian Viewing the City Beautiful and Signing the Declaration
To these he added bringing them from the crowded garret of the
homestead oil paintings of ships commanded by his father and
grandfather and family portraits executedwhich is a peculiarly
fitting wordby deceased local artists in oil and crayon

He boarded up the fireplace in the sitting room and installed a
baseburner stove resurrected from the tinsmiths barn He purchased
a full haircloth set of parlor furniture from old Mrs Penniman who
never had been known to sell any of her hoarded belongings before even
to the antiquers and wouldnt have done so now had it not been that
the captains offer was too princely to be real and the old lady feared
she might be dreaming and would wake up before she received the money
And from Trumet to Ostable he journeyed buying a chair here and a table
there braided rag mats from this one and corded bedsteads and rising
sun quilts from that At least half of Bayport believed with Gabe
Lumley and Miss Phinney that if Captain Cy had not escaped from a home
for the insane he was a likely candidate for such an institution

At the table of the perfect boarding house the captain was not inclined
to be communicative regarding his reasons and his intentions He was a
prime favorite there praising Keturahs cooking joking with Angeline
concerning what he was pleased to call her giddy manner of dressing
and wearing side curls and telling yarns of South American dress
and behavior which would probably have shocked Mrs Trippshe having
recently left the Methodist church to join the ComeOuters because
the Sunday services of the former were with the organ and a paid choir
altogether too playactinif they had not been so interesting and
if Captain Cy had not always concluded them with the observation But
there you cant expect nothin more from ignorant critters denied
the privileges of congregational singin and experience meetins hey
Matilda

Mrs Tripp would sigh and admit that she supposed not

Only I do wish Mr Daniels OUR minister might have a chance to preach
over em poor things

So do I with a covert wink at Mrs Bangs who was a stanch adherent
of the regular faith South America d be just the place for him aint
that so Keturah

He evaded all personal questions put to him by the boarders explaining
that he was renovating the old place just for funhe always had had a
gang of men working for him and it seemed natural somehow But to the
friends of his boyhood Asaph Tidditt and Bailey Bangs he told the real
truth

I swan to man exclaimed Bailey almost tearfully as the trio
wandered through the rooms of the Cy Whittaker place dodging paper
hangers and plasterers I swan to man Whit if it dont almost seem as
though I was a boy again Why its your dads house come back alive
it is so Look at this settin room Seems if I could see him now
asettin by that ere stove and Mrs Whittaker your ma over there
asewin and old Capn Cyyour granddadsnoozin in that big
armchairWhy why whit its the very image of the chair he always set
in

Captain Cy laughed aloud

Its more n that Bailey he said its THE chair Twas up attic
all busted and crippled but I had it made over like new And theres
granddads picture lookin just as I remember himonly he want quite
so much of a frozen wax image as hes painted there Im goin to hang
it where it always hung over the mantelpiece next to the lookin
glass

Great land of love boys he went on you fellers dont know what
this means to me Many and manys the time Ive had this old house and
this old room in my mind Ive seen em aboard ship in a howlin gale
off the Horn Ive seen em down in Surinam of a hot night when
there want a breath scurcely and the Caribs went around dressed in a
handkerchief and a paper cigar and it made you wish you could Ive
seen embut there every time Ive seen em Ive swore that some day
Id come back and LIVE em and now by the big dipper here I am Oh I
tell you chummies you want to be fired OUT of a home and out of a town
to appreciate em Not that I blame the old man he and I was too
much alike to cruise in company But Bayport I was born in and in the
Bayport graveyard they can plant me when Im ready for the scrap heap
Its in the blood andWhy see here Dont I TALK like a Bayporter

You sartin do replied Asaph emphatically

A body d think youd been diggin clams and pickin cranberries in
Bassetts Holler all your life long to hear you

You bet Well thats pride thats what that is I prided myself
on hangin to the Bayport twang through thick and thin Among all the
Spanish Carambas and Madre de Dioses it did me good to come out with
a good old Yankee darn once in a while Kept me feelin like a white
man Oh Im a Whittaker _I_ know it And Ive got all the Whittaker
pigheadedness I guess And because the old manbless his heart I
say nowtold me I shouldnt BE a Whittaker no more nor live like a
Whittaker I simply swore up and down I would be one and come back here
when Id made my pile to heave anchor and stay one till I die Maybe
thats foolishness but its me

He puffed vigorously at the pipe which had taken the place of the
Snowflake cigar and added

Take this old settin roomwhy here it is see Heres dad in his
chair and ma in hers and if you go back far enough granddad in his
just as you say Bailey And heres me a little shaver squattin on
the floor by the stove lookin at the pictures in a heap of Godeys
Ladys Book And says dad Bosn he sayshe used to call me Bosn
in those daysBosn says dad run down cellar and fetch me up a
pitcher of cider thats a good feller Yes yes thats this room as
Ive seen it in my mind ever since I tiptoed through it the night I
run away with my duds in a bundle under my arm Do you wonder I was
fightin mad when I saw what that Howes tribe had done to it

Superintending the making over of the old home occupied most of Captain
Cys daylight time that summer His evenings were spent at Simmonss
store We have no clubs in Bayport strictly speaking for the sewing
circle and the Shakespeare Reading Society are exclusively feminine in
membership therefore Simmonss store is the gathering place of those
males who are bachelors or widowers or who are sufficiently free from
petticoat government to risk an occasional evening out Asaph Tidditt
was a regular sojourner at the store Bailey Bangs happening in to
purchase fifty cents worth of sugar or to have the molasses jug filled
lingered occasionally but not often Captain Cy explained Baileys
absence in characteristic fashion

Variety observed the captain is the spice of life Bailey gets talk
enough to home Whats the use of his comin up here to get more

Oh I dont know said Josiah Dimick with a grin we let him do some
of the talkin himself up here Down at the boardin house Keturah and
Angie Phinney do it all

Yes Still if a feller was condemned to live over a biler factory he
wouldnt hanker to get a job IN it would he When Bailey was a delegate
to the Methodist Conference up in Boston him and a crowd visited the
deef and dumb asylum When twas time to go he was missin and they
found him in the female ward lookin at the inmates Said that the sight
of all them women every one of em not able to say a word was the
most wonderful thing ever he laid eyes on Said it made him feel kind of
reverent and holy almost as if he was in Paradise So Ase Tidditt says
anyway its his yarn

Taint nuther Cy Whittaker declared the indignant Asaph If you
expect Im goin to father all your lies youre mistaken

The crowd at Simmonss discuss politics as a general thing state
and national politics in their seasons but county politics and local
affairs always The question in Bayport that summer aside from that of
the harbor appropriation was who should be hired as downstairs teacher
Our schoolhouse is a twostory building with a schoolroom on each
floor The lower room where the little tots begin with their CAT
Cat and progress until they have mastered the Fourth Reader is called
downstairs Upstairs is of course the second story where the
older children are taught To handle some of the big boys upstairs
is a task for a healthy man and such a one usually fills the teachers
position there Downstairs being in theory at least less strenuous
is presided over by a woman

Miss Seabury who had been downstairs teacher for one lively term had
resigned that spring in tears and humiliation Her scholars had enjoyed
themselves and would have liked her to continue but the committee and
the townspeople thought otherwise There was a general feeling that
enjoyment was not the whole aim of education

Betty said Captain Dimick referring to his small granddaughter has
done fust rate so furs marksmanship and lung trainin goes I callate
she can hit a nail head ten foot off with a spitball three times out of
four and she can whisper loud enough to be understood in Jericho But
not wishing to be unreasonable still I should like to have her spell
door without an e Ive always been used to seein it spelled that
way andwell Im kind of oldfashioned anyway

There was a difference of opinion concerning Miss Seaburys successor
A portion of the townspeople were for hiring a graduate of the State
Normal School a young woman with modern training Others remembering
that Miss Seabury had graduated from that school were for proved
ability and less uptodate methods These latter had selected a
candidate in the person of a Miss Phoebe Dawes a resident of Wellmouth
and teacher of the Wellmouth downstairs for some years The arguments
at Simmonss were hot ones

Whats the use of hirin somebody from right next door to us as you
might say demanded Alpheus Smalley clerk at the store Dont we want
our teachin to be abreast of the times and is Wellmouth abreast of
ANYthing

Its abreast of the bay thats about all I will give in replied Mr
Tidditt But the way I look at it we need disCIPline more n anything
else and Phoebe Dawes has had the best disCIPline in her school thats
been known in these latitudes Order Why say Eben Salters told me
that when he visited her room over there twas so still that he didnt
dast to rub one shoe against tother it sounded up so He had to set
still and bear his chilblains best he could And POPULAR Why when she
hinted that she might leave in May her scholars more n haf of em
bust out cryin Now you hear me I

It seems to me put in Thaddeus Simpson who ran the barber shop
and was something of a politician it seems to me fellers that wed
better wait and hear what Mr Atkins has to say in this matter I
guess thats what the committee ll do anyhow We wouldnt want to go
contrary to Heman none of us hey

Tad Simpson was known to be deep in Congressman Atkinss confidence
The mention of the great mans name was received with reverence and nods
of approval

Thats right We mustnt do nothin to displease Heman was the
general opinion

Captain Cy did not join the chorus He refilled his pipe and crossed his
legs

Humph he grunted Heman Atkins seems to beGive me a match Ase
wont you Thanks I understand theres a special prayer meetin at the
church tomorrow night Alpheus Whats it for

For Mr Smalley seemed surprised Its to pray for rain thats
what You know it Capn as wells I do Aint everybodys garden
dryin up and the ponds so low that we shant be able to get water
for the cranberry ditches pretty soon Theres need to pray I should
think

Humph Seems a roundabout way of gettin a thing dont it Why dont
you telegraph to Heman and ask him to fix it for you Save time

This remark was received in horrified silence Tad Simpson was the first
to recover

Capn he said you aint met Mr Atkins yet When you do youll
feel same as the rest of us Hes comin home next week then youll
see

A part at least of Mr Simpsons prophecy proved true The Honorable
Atkins did come to Bayport the following week accompanied by his little
daughter Alicia the housekeeper and the Atkins servants The Honorable
and his daughter had been since the adjournment of Congress on a
pleasure trip to the Yosemite and Yellowstone Park and now they were
to remain in the mansion on the hill for some time The big house was
opened the stone urns burst into refulgent bloom the iron dogs were
refreshed with a coat of black paint and the big iron gate was swung
wide Bayport sat up and took notice Angeline Phinney was in her glory

The meeting between Captain Cy and Mr Atkins took place the morning
after the latters return The captain and his two chums had been
inspecting the progress made by the carpenters and were leaning over the
new fence then just erected but not yet painted Down the gravel walk
of the mansion across the road came strolling its owner silkhatted
sidewhiskered benignant

Godfrey exclaimed Asaph Theres Heman See him Whit

Yup I see him Seems to be headin this way

II do believe hes comin across whispered Mr Bangs Yes he is
Hes real everyday Cy HE wont mind if you aint dressed up

Wont he Thats comfortin Well Ill do the best I can without
stimulants as the doctor says If you hear my knees rattle just nudge
me will you Bailey

Mr Tidditt removed his hat Bailey touched his Captain Cy looked
provokingly indifferent he even whistled

Good mornin Mr Atkins hailed the town clerk raising his voice
because of the whistle Im proud to see you back among us sir Hope
you and Alicia had a nice time out West How is shepretty smart

Mr Atkins smiled a bland congressional smile He approached the group
by the fence and extended his hand

Ah Asaph he said it is you then I thought so And Bailey too It
is certainly delightful to see you both again Yes my daughter is well
I thank you She like her father is glad to be back in the old
home nest after the round of hotel life and gayety which we
haveerrecently undergone Yes

Mr Atkins said Bailey glancing nervously at Captain Cy who had
stopped whistling and was regarding the Atkins hat and whiskers with an
interested air I want to make you acquainted with your new neighbor
You used to know him when you was a boy butbuterMr Atkins this
is Captain Cyrus Whittaker Cy this is Congressman Atkins Youve heard
us speak of him

The great man started

Is it possible he exclaimed Is it possible that this is really my
old playmate Cyrus Whittaker

Yup replied the captain calmly How are you Heman Fattern you
used to be aint you Washinton must agree with you

Bailey and Asaph were scandalized Mr Atkins himself seemed a trifle
taken aback Comments on his personal appearance were not usual in
Bayport But he rallied bravely

Well well he cried Cyrus I am delighted to welcome you back among
us I should scarcely have known you You are olderyes much older

Well forty year more or less added to what you started with is apt
to make a feller some older Dont need any Normal School graduate to do
that sum for us Im within seven or eight year of bein as old as you
are Heman and thats too antique to be sold for veal

Mr Atkins changed the subject

I had heard of your return Cyrus he said It gave me much pleasure
to learn that you were rebuilding anderrenovating theerthe
ancestraler

The old home nest Yup Im puttin back a few feathers Old birds like
to roost comftable Youve got a fairly roomy coop yourself

Hum Isnt iterI should suppose you would find it rather expensive
Can youdo you

Yes I can afford it thank you Maybe therell be enough left in the
stockin to buy a few knickknacks for the yard You cant tell

The captain glanced at the iron dogs guarding the Atkins gate His tone
was rather sharp

Yes yes certainly certainly of course It gives me much pleasure to
have you as a neighbor I have always felt a fondness for the old place
even when you allowed iteven when it was mosterrun down if youll
excuse the term I always felt a liking for it and

Yes was the significant interruption I judged you must have from
what I heard

This was steering dangerously close to the selectmen and the
contemplated sale for taxes The town clerk broke in nervously

Mr Atkins he said theres been considerble talk in town about
whos to be teacher downstairs this comin year Weve sort of chawed it
over among us but naturally we wanted your opinion What do you think
Im kind of leanin toward the Dawes woman myself

The Congressman cleared his throat

Far be it from me he said to speak except as a mere member of our
little community an ordinary member but AS such a member with the
welfare of my birthplace very near and dear to me I confess that I
am inclined to favor a modern teacher one educated and trained in the
institution provided for the purpose by our great commonwealth
The Daweserperson is undoubtedly worthy and capable in her way
butwellerwe know that Wellmouth is not Bayport

The reference to our great commonwealth had been given in the voice
and the manner wont to thrill us at our FourthofJuly celebrations and
October rallies Two of his hearers at least were visibly impressed
Asaph looked somewhat crestfallen but he surrendered gracefully to
superior wisdom

Thats so he said Thats so aint it Cy I hadnt thought of
that

Whats so asked the captain

Whywhy that Wellmouth aint Bayport

No doubt of it Theyre twenty miles apart

Yes Well Im glad to hear you put it so conclusive Mr Atkins I can
see now that Phoebe wouldnt do Hum Yes

Mr Atkins buttoned the frock coat and turned to go

Good day gentlemen he said Cyrus permit me once more to welcome
you heartily to our village Wemy daughter and myselfwill probably
remain at home until the fall I trust you will be a frequent caller
Run in on us at any time Pray do not stand upon ceremony

No said Captain Cy shortly I wont

Thats right Thats right Good morning

He walked briskly down the hill The trio gazed after him

Well sighed Mr Tidditt Thats settled And its a comfort to know
tis settled Still I did kind of want Phoebe Dawes but of course Heman
knows best

Course he knows best snapped Bailey Aint he the biggest gun in
this county pretty nigh Id like to know who is if he aint The
committee ll call the Normal School girl now and a good thing too

Captain Cy was still gazing at the dignified form of the biggest gun in
the county

Lets see he asked Whos on the school committee Eben Salters of
course and

Yes Ebens chairman and hell vote Phoebe anyhow hes that
pigheaded that nobodynot even a United States Representativecould
change him But Darius Ellis ll be for Hemans way and so ll Lemuel
Myrick

Lemuel Myrick Lem Myrick the painter

Sartin There aint but one Myrick in town

Hum murmured the captain and was silent for some minutes

The school committee met on the following Wednesday evening On Thursday
morning a startling rumor spread throughout Bayport Phoebe Dawes had
been called by a vote of two to one to teach the downstairs school
Asaph aghast rushed out of Simmonss store and up to the hill to the
Cy Whittaker place He found Captain Cy in the front yard Mr Myrick
school committeeman and house painter was with him

Hello Ase hailed the captain Whats the matter Hasnt the tide
come in this mornin

Asaph somewhat embarrassed by the presence of Mr Myrick hesitated
over his news Lemuel came to his rescue

Ase has just heard that we called Phoebe he said What of it I
voted for her and I aint ashamed of it

Butbut Mr Atkins he

Well Heman aint on the committee is he I vote the way I think
right and no one in this town can change me Anyway he added Im
going to resign next spring Yes Capn Whittaker I think three coats
of white ll do on the sides here

Lems goin to do my paintin jobs explained Captain Cy His price
was a little higher than some of the other fellers but I like his
work

Mr Tidditt pondered deeply until dinner time Then he cornered the
captain behind the Bangs barn and spoke with conviction

Whit he said youre the one responsible for the committees hirin
Phoebe Dawes You offered Lem the paintin job if hed vote for her
What did you do it for You dont know her do you

Never set eyes on her in my life

ThenthenYou heard Heman say he wanted the other one What made you
do it

Captain Cy grinned

Ase he said Ive always been a great hand for tryin experiments
Had one of my cooks aboard put raisins in the flapjacks once just to
see what they tasted like I judged Heman had had his own way in this
town for thirty odd year I kind of wanted to see what would happen if
he didnt have it



CHAPTER IV

BAILEY BANGSS EXPERIMENT


Lemuel Myricks painting jobs have the quality so prized by our village
small boys in the species of candy called jaw breakers namely that
of lasting long But even Lem must finish sometime or other and late
in July the Cy Whittaker place was ready for occupancy The pictures
were in their places on the walls the oldfashioned furniture filled
the rooms there was even a pile of old magazines back numbers of
Godeys Ladys Book on the shelf in the sitting room closet

Then when Captain Cy had notified Mrs Bangs that the perfect boarding
house would shelter him no longer than the coming week a new problem
arose

Whit said Asaph earnestly youve sartin made the place rise up out
of its tomb you have so Its a miracle pretty nigh and I callate
it must have cost a heap but youve done itall but the old folks
themselves You cant raise them up Cy money wont do that And you
cant live in this great house all alone Whos goin to cook for you
and sweep and dust and swab decks and one thing another Youll have
to have a housekeeper as I told you a spell ago Have you done any
thinkin about that

And the captain taking his pipe from his lips stared blankly at his
friend and answered

By the big dipper Ase I aint I remember we did mention it but Ive
been so busy gettin this craft off the ways that I forgot all about
it

The discussion which followed Mr Tidditts reminder was long and
serious Asaph and Bailey Bangs racked their brains and offered numerous
suggestions but the majority of these were not favorably received

Theres Matildy Tripp said Bailey Shed like the job Im sartin
Shes a widow too and shes had experience keepin house along of
Tobias him that was her husband But if you do hire her dont let
Ketury know I hinted at it cause were goin to lose one boarder
when you quit and thats too many cordin to the old ladys way of
thinkin

You can keep Matildy for all me replied the captain decidedly
ComeOuter religions all right for those that have that kind of
appetite but havin it passed to me three times a day same as Ive
had it at your house is enough I dont hanker to have it warmed over
between meals If I shipped Matildy aboard here she and the Reverend
Daniels would stand over me watch and watch till I was converted or
crazy one or the other

Well theres Angie She

Angie sniffed Mr Tidditt Stop your jokin Bailey This is a
serious matter

I want jokin What

There there boys interrupted the captain dont fight Bailey
didnt mean to joke Ase hes full of what the papers call unconscious
humor Ill give in that Angie is about as serious a matter as I can
think of without settin down to rest Humph so fur we havent gained
any knots to speak of Any more candidates on your mind

More possibilities were mentioned but none of them seemed to fill the
bill The conference broke up without arriving at a decision Mr Bangs
and the town clerk walked down the hill together

Do you know Bailey said Asaph the way I look at it this pickin
out a housekeeper for Whit aint any common job Its somethin to think
over Cys a restless critter been cruisin hither and yon all his
life Im sort of scared that hell get tired of Bayport and quit if
things here dont go to suit him Now if a real good nice womana nice
LOOKIN woman saywas to keep house for him itit

Well

Well I meanthat is dont you spose if some such woman as that
was to be found for the job he might in time come to like her
andander

Ase Tidditt what are you drivin at

Why I mean he might come to marry her there Then hed be contented
to settle down to home and stay put What do you think of the idea

Think of it I think its the dumdest foolishness ever I heard I
declare if the very mention of a woman to some of you old baches
dont make your heads soften up like a jellyfish in the sun Aint Cy
Whittaker got money Aint he got a nice home Aint he happy

Yes he is now I spose but

WELL then And you want him to get married What do you know about
marryin Never tried it have you

Course I aint You know I aint

All right Then Id keep quiet about such things if I was you

You neednt fly up like a settin hen Everybodys wife aint

He stopped in the middle of the sentence

Whats that demanded his companion sharply

Nothin nothin _I_ dont care I was only tryin to fix things
comftable for Whit Has Heman said anything about the harbor
appropriation sence hes been home I havent heard of it if he has

Mr Bangss answer was a grunt signifying a negative Congressman
Atkins had been since his return to Bayport exceedingly noncommittal
concerning the appropriation To Tad Simpson and a very few chosen
lieutenants and intimates he had said that he hoped to get it that was
all This was a disquieting change of attitude for at the beginning
of the term just passed he had affirmed that he was GOING to get it
However as Mr Simpson reassuringly said The jobs in as good hands
as can be so whats the use of OUR worryin

Bailey Bangs certainly was not troubled on that score but the town
clerks proposal that Captain Cy be provided with a suitable wife did
worry him Bailey was so very much married himself and had such decided
though unspoken views concerning matrimony that such a proposal seemed
to him lunacy pure and simple He had liked and admired his friend
Whit in the old days when the latter led them into all sorts of
boyish scrapes now he regarded him with a liking that was close
to worship The captain was so jolly and outspoken so brave and
independentwitness his crossing of the great Atkins in the matter of
the downstairs teacher That was a reckless piece of folly which would
doubtless be rewarded after its kind but Bailey though he professed
to condemn it secretly wished he had the pluck to dare such things As
it was he didnt dare contradict Keturah

With the exception of one voyage as cabin boy to New Orleans a voyage
which convinced him that he was not meant for a seaman Mr Bangs had
never been farther from his native village than Boston Captain Cy had
been almost everywhere and seen almost everything He could spin yarns
that beat the serial stories in the patent inside of the Bayport Breeze
all hollow Bailey had figured that when the fixin over was ended
the Cy Whittaker place would be for him a delightful haven of refuge
where he could put his boots on the furniture smoke until dizzy without
being pounced upon be entertained and thrilled with tales of adventure
afloat and ashore and even express his own opinion when he had any
with the voice and lung power of a freeborn American citizen

And now Asaph Tidditt who should know better even though he was a
bachelor wanted to bring a wife into this paradise not a paid domestic
who could be silenced or discharged if she became a nuisance but a
WIFE Bailey guessed not not if he could prevent it

So he lay awake nights thinking of possible housekeepers for Captain Cy
and carefully rejecting all those possessing dangerous attractions of
any kind Each morning after breakfast he ran over the list with the
captain taking care that Asaph was not present Captain Cy who was
very busy with the finishing touches at the new old house wearied on
the third morning

There there Bailey he said Dont bother me now Ive got other
things on my mind How do I know who all these women folks are youre
stringing off to me Let me alone do

But you must have a housekeeper Cy Youll move in Monday and you
wont have nobody to

Oh dry up I want to think who I must see this morning Theres Lem
and old lady Penniman and

But the housekeeper Cy Dont you see

Hire one yourself then You know em I dont

Hey Hire one myself Do you mean youll leave it in my hands

Yes yes I guess so Run along thats a good feller

He departed hurriedly Mr Bangs scratched his head A weighty
responsibility had been laid upon him

Monday morning after breakfast Captain Cys trunk was put aboard
the depot wagon and Danl Webster drew it to its owners home The
farewells at the perfect boarding house were affecting Mrs Tripp said
that she had spoken to the Reverend Mr Daniels and he would be sure to
call the very first thing Keturah affirmed that the captains stay had
been a real pleasure

You never find fault Capn Whittaker she said Youre such a manly
man if youll excuse my sayin so I only wish there was more like
you with a significant glance at her husband As for Miss Phinney
she might have been saying goodby yet if the captain had not excused
himself

Asaph accompanied his friend to the house on the hill The trunk was
unloaded from the wagon and carried into the bedroom on the first floor
the room which had been Captain Cys so long ago Gabe shrieked at Danl
Webster and the depot wagon crawled away toward the upper road

Got to meet the up train grumbled the driver Not that anybody ever
comes on it but I callate Im sposed to be there Be more talk than a
little if I want Git dap Danl youre slowern the moral law

So youre goin to do your own cookin for a spell Cy observed
Asaph a half hour later Well I guess thats a good idea till you
can find the right housekeeper I aint been able to think of one that
would suit you yet

Nor I either Neithers Bailey I judge though for a while he was as
full of suggestions as a pine grove is of woodticks He started to say
somethin about it to me last night but Ketury hove in sight and yanked
him off to prayer meetin

Yes I know She callates to get him into heaven somehow

I guess twouldnt BE heaven for her unless he was round to pick at
There he comes now Howd he get out of wipin dishes

Mr Bangs strolled into the yard

Hello he hailed I was on my way to Simmonss on an errand and I
thought Id stop in a minute Got somethin to tell you Whit

All right Overboard with it It wont keep long this hot weather

Bailey smiled knowingly Didnt I hear the up train whistle as I was
comin along he asked Seems to me I did Yes well if I aint
mistaken somebodys comin on that train Somebody for you Cy
Whittaker

Somebody for ME

Umhum I can genrally be depended on I callate and when you says
to me Bailey you get me a housekeeper I didnt lose much time I
got her

Mr Tidditt gasped

GOT her he repeated Got who Got what Bailey Bangs what in the
world have

Belay Ase ordered Captain Cy Bailey what are you givin us

Givin you a housekeeper and a good one too I shouldnt wonder She
may not be one of them tenthousanddollar prize museum beauties with
a scornful wink at Asaph but if what I hears true she can keep house
Anyhow shes kept one for forty odd year Her names Deborah Beasley
shes a widow over to East Trumet and if I dont miss my guess shes
in the depot wagon now headed in this direction

Captain Cy whistled Mr Tidditt was too much surprised to do even that

I was speakin to the feller that drives the candy cart continued
Bailey and I asked him if hed run acrost anybody durin his trips
round the country whod be likely to hire out for a housekeeper He
thought a spell and then named over some Among em was this Beasley
one I asked some more questions and the answers bein satisfactory to
ME though they might not be to some folks another derisive wink at
AsaphI set down and wrote her tellin what youd pay Cy what shed
have to do and when shed have to come Saturday night I got a letter
sayin terms was all right and shed be on hand by this mornins train
Course shes only on trial for a month but you had to have SOMEBODY
and the candycart feller said

The town clerk slapped his knee

Debby Beasley he cried I know who she is Ive got a cousin in
Trumet Debby Beasley Aunt Debby they call her Why shes old enough
to be Methusalems grandmarm and

If I recollect right interrupted Bailey with dignity Cy never said
he wanted a YOUNG womana frivolous giddy critter always riggin up
and chasin the fellers He wanted a sot sober housekeeper

Godfrey Aunt Debby aint frivolous She couldnt chase a lame
clamand catch it And DEEF Godfreyscissors shes deefer n one of
them castiron Newfoundlands in Hemans yard Do you mean to say Bailey
Bangs that you went ahead on your own hook and hired that old relic
to

I did And I had my authority didnt I Whit You told me youd leave
it in my hands now didnt you

The captain smiled somewhat ruefully and scratched his head Why
to be honest Bailey I believe I did he admitted Still I hardly
expectedHumph is she deef as Ase says

I understand shes a little mite hard of hearin replied Mr Bangs
with dignity but that aint any drawback the way I look at it Fact
is Id call it an advantage but you folks seem to be hard to please
I ruther imagined youd thank me for gettin her but I spose that was
too much to expect All right pitch her out Dont mind MY feelins
Poor homeless critter comin to

Homeless repeated Asaph Whats that got to do with it Cy aint
runnin the Old Womans Home

Well well observed the captain resignedly Theres no use in rowin
about what cant be helped Bailey says he shipped her for a months
trial and here comes the depot wagon now Thats her on the aft thwart
I judge She AINT what youd call a spring pullet is she

She certainly was not The occupant of the depot wagons rear seat was a
thin not to say scraggy female wearing a black beflowered bonnet and
a black gown A black knit shawl was draped about her shoulders and she
wore spectacles

Whoa commanded Mr Lumley piloting the depot wagon to the side door
of the Whittaker house Danl Webster came to anchor immediately Gabe
turned and addressed his passenger

Here we be he shouted

Hey observed the lady in black

Herewebe repeated Gabe raising his voice

See See what

Oh heavens to Betsey Im gettin the croup from howlin
IsayHEREWEBE GET OUT

He accompanied the final bellow with an expressive pantomime indicating
that the passenger was expected to alight She seemed to understand
for she opened the door of the carriage and slowly descended Mr Bangs
advanced to meet her

How dye do Mrs Beasley he said Glad to see you all safe and
sound

Mrs Beasley shook his hand hers were covered as far as the knuckles
by black mitts

How dye do Capn Whittaker she said in a shrill voice You pretty
smart

Bailey hastened to explain

I aint Capn Whittaker he roared Im Bailey Bangs the one that
wrote to you

Hey

Mr Lumley and Asaph chuckled Bailey colored and tried again

I aint the capn he whooped Here he ishere

He led her over to her prospective employer and tapped the latter on the
chest

How dye do sir said the housekeeper I dont knows I just caught
your name

In five minutes or so the situation was made reasonably clear Mrs
Beasley then demanded her trunk and carpet bag The grinning Lumley bore
them into the house Then he drove away still grinning Bailey looked
fearfully at Captain Cy

She IS kind of hard of hearin aint she he said reluctantly You
remember I said she was

The captain nodded

Yes he answered youre a truthtellin chap Bailey Ill say that
for you You dont exaggerate your statements

Hard of hearin snapped Mr Tidditt If the last trump aint a steam
whistle shell miss Judgment Day Ill stop into Simmonss on my way
along and buy you a bottle of throat balsam Cy youre goin to need
it

The captain needed more than throat balsam during the fortnight which
followed The widow Beasleys deafness was not her only failing In fact
she was altogether a failure so far as her housekeeping was concerned
She could cook after a fashion but the fashion was so limited that
even the bill of fare at the perfect boarding house looked tempting in
retrospect

Baked beans again Cy exclaimed Asaph dropping in one evening after
supper Taint Saturday night so soon is it

No was the dismal rejoinder Its Tuesday if my almanac aint out
of joint But we had beans Saturday and they aint all gone yet so I
presume well have em till the last ones swallowed Aunt Debbys got
what the piece in the Reader used to call a frugal mind She dont
intend to waste anything Last Thursday I spunked up courage enough to
yell for salt fish and potatoesfixed up with pork scraps you know
sames we used to have when I was a boy We had em all right and if
beans of a Saturday hadnt been part of her religion wed be warmin em
up yet I took in a cat for company tother day but the critters
run away To see it look at the beans in its saucer and then at me was
pitiful I felt like handin myself over to the Cruelty to Animals
folks

Is she neat inquired Mr Tidditt

I dont know I guess soon the installment plan It takes her a week
to scrub up the kitchen and then one end of it is so dirty she has to
begin again Consequently the dust is so thick in the rest of the house
that I can see my tracks If twant so late in the season Id plant
garden stuff in the parlornice soil and lots of shade with the
curtains down

From the rooms in the rear came the words of a gospel hymn sung in a
tremulous soprano and at concert pitch

Music with my meals just like a hightoned restaurant commented
Captain Cy

But what makes her sing so everlastin LOUD

Cant hear herself if she dont I could stand her deefness because
thats an affliction and we may all come to it but

The housekeeper still singing entered the room and planted herself in
a chair

Good evenin Mr Tidditt she said smiling genially Nice weather
weve been havin

Asaph nodded

Sociable critter aint she observed the captain Always willin to
help entertain Comes and sets up with me till bedtime Tells about
her family troubles Preaches about her niece out West and how set the
niece and the rest of the Western relations are to have her make em a
visit I told her she better goI thought twould do her good I know
twould help ME considerble to see her start

Shes got so now she finds fault with my neckties he added says I
must be careful and not get my feet wet Picks out what I ought to wear
sos I wont get cold Shell adopt me pretty soon Oh its all right
She cant hear what you say Are your dishes done he shrieked turning
to the old lady

One One what inquired Mrs Beasley

They wont BE done till you go Ase continued the master of the
house Shell stay with us till the last gun fires Tother day
Angie Phinney called and I turned Debby loose on her I didnt believe
anything could wear out Angies talkin machinery but she did it
Angeline stayed twenty minutes and then quit hoarse as a crow

Here the widow joined in the conversation evidently under the
impression that nothing had been said since she last spoke Continuing
her favorable comments on the weather she observed that she was glad
there was so little fog because fog was hard for folks with neuralgy
pains Her brothers wifes cousin had neuralgy for years and
she described his sufferings with enthusiasm and infinite detail Mr
Tidditt answered her questions verbally at first later by nods and
shakes of the head Captain Cy fidgeted in his chair

Come on outdoor Ase he said at last No use to wait till she runs
down cause shes a selfwinder guaranteed to keep goin for a year
Goodnight he shouted addressing Mrs Beasley and heading for the
door

Where you goin asked the old lady

No Yes Who said so Hooray Three cheers for Genral Scott Come on
Ase And the captain seizing his friend by the arm dragged him into
the open air and slammed the door

Are you crazy demanded the astonished town clerk What makes you
talk like that

Might as well She wouldnt understand it any better if twas
Scripture and it saves brain work The only satisfaction I get is
bein able to give my opinion of her and the grub without hurtin her
feelins If I called her a woodenheaded jumpin jack shed only smile
and say No she didnt think twas goin to rain or somethin just as
brilliant

Well why dont you give her her walkin papers

I shall when her months up

I wouldnt wait no month Id heave her overboard tonight You hear
ME

Captain Cy shook his head

I cant very well he replied I hate to make her feel TOO bad When
the months over Ill have some excuse ready maybe The joke of it is
that she dont really need to work out Shes got some money of her
own owns cranberry swamps and I dont know what all Says she took up
Baileys offer cause she callated Id be company for her I had to
laugh even in the face of those beans when she said that

Humph if I dont tell Bailey what I think of him then

No no Dont you say a word to Bailey Its principally on his account
that Im tryin to stick it out for the month Bailey did his best he
thought he was helpin And he feels dreadfully because shes so deef
Only yesterday he asked me if I believed there was anything made that
would fix her up and make it more comfortable for me I could have
prescribed a shotgun but I didnt You see he thinks her deefness
is the only trouble I havent told him the rest and dont you do it
either Baileys a goodhearted chap

Humph his heart may be good but his heads goin to seed Ill keep
quiet if twill please you though

Yes And see here Ase I dont care to be the laughin stock of
Bayport If any of the folks ask you how I like my new housekeeper you
tell em theres nothin like her anywhere Thats no lie

So Mrs Beasley stayed on at the Whittaker place and thanks to Mr
Tidditt the general opinion of inquisitive Bayport was that the new
housekeeper was a grand success Only Captain Cy and Asaph knew the
whole truth and Mr Bangs a part That part Deborahs deafness
troubled him not a little and he thought much concerning it As a result
of this thinking he wrote a letter to a relative in Boston The answer
to this letter pleased him and he wrote again

One afternoon during the third week of Mrs Beasleys stay Asaph
called and found Captain Cy in the sitting room reading the Breeze The
captain urged his friend to remain and have supper Weve run out of
beans Ase he explained and are just startin in on a course of
boiled cod Do stay and eat a lot then there wont be so much to warm
over

Mr Tidditt accepted the invitation also a section of the Breeze While
they were reading they heard the back door slam

Its the graven image explained the captain Shes been on a
cruise down town somewheres Be a lot of sore throats in that direction
tomorrow mornin

The town clerk looked up

There now he exclaimed I believe twas her I saw walkin with
Bailey a spell ago I thought so but I didnt have my specs and I want
sure

With Bailey hey Humph this is serious Hope Ketury didnt see em
We mustnt have any scandal

The housekeeper entered the dining room She was singing Beulah Land
but her tone was more subdued than usual They heard her setting the
table

Hows she gettin along asked Asaph

Progressin backwards same as ever Shes no better thank you and
the doctors given up hopes

When you goin to tell her she can clear out

What Captain Cy had returned to his paper and did not hear the
question

I say when is she goin to be bounced Deefness aint catchin is it

I wouldnt wonder if it might be If tis mine ought to be developin
fast What makes her so still all at once

Gone to the kitchen I guess Wonder she hasnt sailed in and set down
with us Old chromo You must be glad her months most up

Asaph proceeded to give his opinion of the housekeeper raising his
voice almost to a howl as his indignation grew If Mrs Beasleys ears
had been ordinary ones she might have heard the unflattering description
in the kitchen as it was Mr Tidditt felt no fear

Comin here sos you could be company for her The idea Good to
herself aint she Godfrey scissors And Bailey was fool enough to

There there Dont let it worry you Ase Ive about decided what
to say when I let her go Ill tell her she is gettin too old to be
slavin herself to death You see I dont want to make the old critter
cry nor I dont want her to get mad Judgin by the way she used to
coax the cat outdoors with the broom handle shes got somethin of a
temper when she gets started Ill give her an extry months wages
and

You will hey You WILL

The interruption came from behind the partially closed diningroom door
Mr Tidditt sank back in his chair Captain Cy sprang from his and threw
the door wide open Behind it crouched Mrs Deborah Beasley Her eyes
snapped behind her spectacles her lean form was trembling all over and
in her right hand she held a mammoth trumpet the smaller end of which
was connected with her ear

You will hey she screamed brandishing her left fist but still
keeping the ear trumpet in place with her right You WILL Well I
dont want none of your miserble money Land knows how you made it
anyhow and I wouldnt soil my hands with it After all Ive put up
with and the way Ive done my work and the things Ive had to eat
andand

She paused for breath Captain Cy scratched his chin Asaph gazing
openmouthed at the trumpet stirred in his chair Mrs Beasley swooped
down upon him like a gull on a minnow

And you she shrieked You a miserable little goodfornothin
lazy ridiculous driedup    OoooOH You call yourself a town
clerk YOU do II wouldnt have you clerk for a hen house Im an old
chromo be I Yes thats nice talk aint it to a woman old enough
to bethat iserermost as old as you be You sneakin
storytellin little fat THING you Youoh I cant lay my tongue to
words to tell you WHAT you are

Youre doin pretty well seems to me observed Captain Cy dryly I
wouldnt be discouraged if I was you

The only effect of this remark was to turn the wordy torrent in his
direction The captain bore it for a while then he rose to his feet and
commanded silence

Thats enough Stop it he ordered and strange to say Mrs Beasley
did stop Im sorry Debby he went on but you had no business to be
listenin even if and he smiled grimly you have got a new fog horn
to hear with You can go and pack your things as soon as you want to I
made up my mind the first day you come that you and me wouldnt cruise
together long and this only shortens the trip by a week or so Ill pay
you for this month and for the next and I guess when you come to think
it over youll be willin to risk soilin your hands with the money
Its your own fault if anybody knows that you didnt leave of your own
accord _I_ shant tell and Ill see that Tidditt doesnt Now trot
Ase and Ill get supper ourselves

It was evident that the exhousekeeper had much more which she would
have liked to say But there was that in her late employers manner
which caused her to forbear She slammed out of the room and they heard
her banging things about on the floor above

But whereWHERE repeated Mr Tidditt over and over did she get
that trumpet

The puzzle was solved soon after when Bailey Bangs entered the house in
a high state of excitement

Well he demanded expectantly Did they help her Has anything
happened

HAPPENED began Asaph but Captain Cy silenced him by a wink

Yes answered the captain somethings happened Why

Hurrah I thought twould She can hear better cant she

Yes I guess its safe to say she can

Good You can thank me for it When I see how dreadful deef she was I
wrote my cousin Eddie T whos an optician up to Bostonyou know him
Aseand I says Ed you know whats good for folks who cant see
Aint there nothin says I thatll help them who cant hear How
about ear trumpets And Ed wrote that an ear trumpet would probably
help some but why didnt I try a pair of them patent fixins that are
made to put inside deef peoples ears Hed known of cases where they
helped a lot So I sent for a pair and the biggest ear trumpet made
besides And when I met Debby today I give em to her and told her to
put the patent things IN her ears and couple on the trumpet outside
em And not to say nothin to you but just surprise you And it did
surprise you didnt it

The wrathful Mr Tidditt could wait no longer He burst into a vivid
description of the surprise Bailey was aghast Captain Cy laughed
until his face was purple

I declare Cy exclaimed the dejected purchaser of the ear fixins
and the trumpet I do declare Im awful sorry if youd only told me
she was no good Id have let her alone but I thought twas just the
deefness II

I know Bailey you meant well like the layinonofhands doctor who
rubbed the rheumatic mans wooden leg All right _I_ forgive you Twas
worth it all to see Asaphs face when Marm Beasley was complimentin
him Ha ha Oh dear me Ive laughed till Im sore But theres one
thing I SHOULD like to do if you dont mind I should like to pick out
my next housekeeper myself



CHAPTER V

A FRONTDOOR CALLER


Mrs Beasley departed next morning taking with her the extra months
wages in spite of fervid avowals that she wouldnt touch a cent of
it On the way to the depot she favored Mr Lumley with sundry hints
concerning the reasons for her departure She couldnt stand it no
longer if folks only knew what shed had to put up with she callated
theyd be some surprised she could tell a few things if she wanted
to and so on Incidentally she was kind of glad she didnt like the
place because now she callated she should go West and visit her niece
theyd been wanting her to come for so long

Gabe was much interested and repeated the monologue with imaginative
additions to the depot master who in turn repeated it to his wife
when he went home to dinner That lady attended sewing circle in the
afternoon Next day a large share of Bayports conversation dealt with
the housekeepers leaving and her reasons therefor The reasons
differed widely according to the portion of the town in which they were
discussed but it was the general opinion that the whole affair was not
creditable to Captain Whittaker

Only at the perfect boarding house was the captain upheld Miss Phinney
declared that she knew he had made a mistake as soon as she heard the
Beasley woman talk nobody else so Angeline declared could get a word
in edgeways Mrs Tripp sighed and affirmed that going out of town for
a woman to do housework was ridiculous on the face of it there were
plenty of Bayport ladies women of capability and sound in their
religious views who might be hired if they were approached in the right
way Keturah gave as her opinion that if the captain knew when he was
well off he would take his meals out Asaph snorted and intimated
that that Debby Beasley wasnt fit to keep house in a pigsty and
anybody but a born gump would have known it Bailey the born gump
said nothing but looked appealingly at his chum

As for Captain Cy he did not take the trouble to affirm or deny the
rumors Peace and quiet dominated the Whittaker house for the first time
in three weeks and its owner was happier He cooked his own food and
washed his own dishes The runaway cat ventured to return found other
viands than beans in its saucer and decided to remain purring thankful
contentment The captain made his own bed after a fashion when he was
ready to occupy it but he was conscious that it might be better made
He refused however to spend his time in sweeping and dusting and
the dust continued to accumulate on the carpets and furniture This
condition of affairs troubled him but he kept his own counsel Asaph
and Bailey called often but they offered no more suggestions as to
hiring a housekeeper Mr Tidditt might have done so but the captain
gave him no encouragement Mr Bangs recent humiliation fresh in his
mind would as soon have suggested setting the house on fire

One evening Asaph happened in on his way to Simmonss He desired
the captain to accompany him to that gathering place of the wise and
talkative Captain Cy was in the sitting room a sheet of note paper in
his hand The town clerk entered without ceremony and tossed his hat on
the sofa

Evenin Ase observed the captain folding the sheet of paper and
putting it into his pocket Glad you come Sit down I wanted to ask
you somethin

All right Here I be Heave ahead and ask

Captain Cy puffed at his pipe He seemed about to speak and then to
think better of it for he crossed his legs and smoked on in silence
gazing at the nickel work of the baseburner stove It was badly in
need of polishing

Well inquired Asaph with impatient sarcasm Thinkin of askin me
to build a fire for you was you Nobody else but you would have set up
a stove in summer time anyhow

Hey No you neednt start a fire yet awhile That necktie of yours ll
keep us warm till fall I shouldnt wonder New one aint it Whered
you get it

Mr Tidditt was wearing a crocheted scarf of a brilliant crimson hue
particularly becoming to his complexion The complexion now brightened
until it was almost a match for the tie

Oh he said with elaborate indifference That Yes its new
Yesterday was my birthday and Matildy Tripp she knew I needed a
necktie so she give me this one

Oh One she knit purpose for you then Dear me Look out Ase Widow
women are dangerous they say presents are one of the first baits they
heave out

Dont be foolish now I couldnt chuck it back at her could I That
would be pretty manners You neednt talk about widdersnot after
Debby Ho ho

Captain Cy chuckled Then he suddenly became serious

Ase he said you remember the time when the Howes folks had this
house Course you do Yes well was there any of their relations here
with em Aa cousin or somethin

No not as I recollect Yes there was too come to think A third
cousin Mary Thayer her name was I THINK she was a third cousin of
Betsy Howes Seth Howess second wife Betsys name was Ginn afore
she married and the Ginns was related on their mas side to a
RichardsEmily Richards I think twasand Emily married a Thayer
Would that make this Mary a third cousin Now lets see Sarah Jane
Ginn she had an aunt who kept a boardin house in Harniss I remember
that count of her sellin my Uncle Bije a pig Seems to me twas a
pig but I aint sure that it mightnt have been a settin of Plymouth
Rock hens eggs Anyhow Uncle Bije KEPT hens because I remember one
time

There there well be out of sight of land in a minute This Mary
Thayerold was she

No no Just a young girl eighteen or twenty or so Pretty and nice
and quiet as ever I see By Godfrey she WAS pretty I want as old as I
be now and

Ase dont tell your heart secrets even to me I might get
absentminded and mention em to Matildy And thenwhew

If you dont stop tryin to play smarty Ill go home Whats Matildy
Tripp to me Id like to know And even when Mary Thayer was here I was
old enough to be her dad But I remember what a nice girl she was and
how the boarders liked her They used to say she done more than all the
Howes tribe put together to make the Sea Sight House a good hotel Young
as she was she done most of the housekeepin and done it well If the
rest of em had been like her you mightnt have had the place yet Whit
But what set you to thinkin about her

Oh I dont know Nothin much that iswell Ill tell you some other
time What became of her

She went up to New Hampshire along with the Howes folks and I aint
seen her since Seems to me I did hear she was married See here Whit
what is it about her Tell a feller come

But Captain Cy refused to gratify his chums lively curiosity Also he
refused to go to Simmonss that evening saying that he was tired and
guessed hed stay at home and turn in early Mr Tidditt departed
grumbling After he had gone the captain drew his chair nearer the
center table took from his pocket a sheet of notepaper and proceeded
to read what was written on its pages It was a letter which he had
received nearly a month before and had not yet answered During the past
week he had read it many times The writing was cramped and blotted and
the paper cheap and dingy The envelope bore the postmark of a small
town in Indiana and the inclosure was worded as follows


CAPTAIN CYRUS WHITTAKER

DEAR SIR I suppose you will be a good deal surprised to hear from me
especially from way out West here When you bought the old house of
Seth he and I was living in Concord N H He couldnt make a go of his
business there so we came West and he has been sick most of the time
since We aint well off like you and times are hard with us What I
wanted to write you about was this My cousin Mary Thomas Mary Thayer
that was is still living in Concord and she is poor and needs help
though I dont suppose she would ask for it being too proud False
pride I call it Me and Seth would like to do something for her but we
have a hard enough job to keep going ourselves Mary married a man
by the name of Henry Thomas and he turned out to be a miserable
goodfornothing as I always said he would She wouldnt listen to
me though He run off and left her seven year ago last April and I
understand was killed or drowned somewheres up in Montana Mary and
several words scratched out here got along somehow since but I dont
know how While we lived in Concord Seth sort of kept an eye on her but
now he cant of course Shes a good girl or woman rather being most
forty and would make a good housekeeper if you should need one as I
suppose likely you will If you could help her it would be an act of
charity and you will be rewarded Above Seth says why not write to her
and tell her to come and see you He feels bad about her because he is
so sick I suppose And he knows you are rich and could do good if you
felt like it Her fathers name was John Thayer I wouldnt wonder if
you used to know her mother She was Emily Richards afore she married
and they used to live in Orham

Yours truly

ELIZABETH HOWES

PSMarys address is Mrs Mary Thomas care Mrs Oliver 128 Blank
Street Concord N H

NBSeth wont say so but I will we are very hard up ourselves and
if you could help him and me with the loan of a little money it would be
thankfully received


Captain Cy read the letter folded it and replaced it in his pocket
He knew the Howes family by reputation and the reputation was that
of general sharpness in trade and stinginess in money matters Betsys
personal appeal did not therefore touch his heart to any great extent
He surmised also that for Seth Howes and his wife to ask help for some
person other than themselves premised a darky in the woodpile somewhere
But for the daughter of Emily Richards to be suggested as a possible
housekeeper at the Cy Whittaker placethat was interesting certainly

When the captain was not a captainwhen he was merely young Cy a
boy living with his parents a dancing school was organized in Bayport
It was an innovation for our village and frowned upon by many of the
older and stricter inhabitants However most of the captains
boy friends were permitted to attend young Cy was not His father
considered dancing a waste of time and if not wicked certainly
frivolous and nonsensical So the boy remained at home but in spite of
the parental order he practiced some of the figures of the quadrilles
and the contra dances in his comrades barns learning them at second
hand so to speak

One winter there was to be a party in Orham given by the Nickersons
wealthy people with a fifteenyearold daughter It was to be a grand
affair and most of the boys and girls in the neighboring towns were
invited Cy received an invitation and for a wonder was permitted to
attend The Bayport contingent went over in a big hayrick on runners and
the moonlight ride was jolly enough The Nickerson mansion was crowded
and there were music and dancing

Young Cy was miserable during the dancing He didnt dare attempt it in
spite of his lessons in the barn So while the rest of his boy friends
sought partners for the Portland Fancy and Hulls Victory he sat
forlorn in a corner

As he sat there he was approached by a young lady radiant in muslin
and ribbons She was three or four years older than he was and he had
worshipped her from afar as she whirled up and down the line in the
Virginia Reel She never lacked partners and seemed to be a great
favorite with the young men especially one goodlooking chap with a
sunburned face who looked like a sailor

They were forming sets for Money Musk it was ladies choice and
there was a demand for more couples The young lady came ever to Cys
corner and laughingly dropped him a courtesy

If you please she said I want a partner Will you do me the honor

Cy blushingly avowed that he couldnt dance any to speak of

Oh yes you can Im sure you can Youre the Whittaker boy arent
you Ive heard about your barn lessons And I want you to try this
with me Please do No John she added turning to the sunburned young
fellow who had followed her across the room this is my choice and here
is my partner Susie Taylor is after you and you mustnt run away Come
Mr Whittaker

So Cy took her arm and they danced Money Musk together He made but
a few mistakes and these she helped him to correct so easily that none
noticed His success gave him courage and he essayed other dances in
fact he had a very good time at the party after all

On the way home he thought a great deal about the pretty young lady
whose name he discovered was Emily Richards He decided that if she
would only wait for him he might like to marry her when he grew up
But he was thirteen and she was seventeen and the very next year she
married John Thayer the sailor in the blue suit And two years after
that young Cy ran away to be a sailor himself

In spite of his age and his lifetime of battering about the world
Captain Cy had a sentimental streak in his makeup his rejuvenation of
the old home proved that Betsys letter interested him He had made
guarded inquiries concerning Mary Thayer now Mary Thomas of others
besides Asaph and the answers had been satisfactory so far as they
went those who remembered her had liked her very much The captain
had even begun a letter to Mrs Thomas but laid it aside unfinished
having since Baileys unfortunate experience with the widow Beasley a
prejudice against experiments

But this evening before Mr Tidditt called he had been thinking that
something would have to be done and done soon The generally shiftless
condition of his domestic surroundings was getting to be unbearable
Dust and dirt did not fit into his mental picture of the old home as
it used to be and as he had tried to restore it There had been neither
dust nor dirt in his mothers day

He meditated and smoked for another hour Then his mind being made up
he pulled down the desk lid of the oldfashioned secretary resurrected
from a pile of papers the note he had begun to Mrs Thomas dipped a
sputtering pen into the ink bottle and proceeded to write

His letter was a short one and rather noncommittal As Mrs Thomas no
doubt knew he had come back to live in his fathers house at Bayport He
might possibly need some one to keep house for him He understood that
she Mary Thayer that was was a good housekeeper and that she was open
to an engagement if everything was mutually satisfactory He had known
her mother slightly when the latter lived in Orham He thought an
interview might be pleasant for they could talk over old times if
nothing more Perhaps on the whole she might care to risk a trip
to Bayport therefore he inclosed money for her railroad fare You
understand of course so he wrote in conclusion that nothing may
come of our meeting at all So please dont say a word to anybody when
you strike town Youve lived here yourself and you know that three
words hove overboard in Bayport will dredge up gab enough to sink a
dictionary So just keep mum till the business is settled one way or the
other

He put on his hat and went down to the post office where he dropped
his letter in the slot of the box fastened to the front door Then he
returned home and retired at exactly eleven oclock In spite of his
remarks to Asaph he had not turned in so early after all

If the captain expected a prompt reply to his note he was disappointed
A week passed and he heard nothing Then three more days and still no
word from the New Hampshire widow Meanwhile fresh layers of dust spread
themselves over the Whittaker furniture and the gaudy patterns of the
carpets blushed dimly beneath a grimy fog The situation was desperate
even Matilda Tripp ComeOuter sermons and all began to be thinkable as
a possibility

The eleventh day began with a pouring rain that changed later on to a
dismal drizzle The silverleaf tree in the front yard dripped and the
overflowing gutters gurgled and splashed The bay was gray and lonely
and the fish weirs along the outer bar were lost in the mist The
flowers in the Atkins urns were draggled and beaten down Only the iron
dogs glistened undaunted as the wet ran off their newly painted backs
The air was heavy and the salty flavor of the flats might almost be
tasted in it

Captain Cy was in the sitting room as usual His spirits were as gray
as the weather He was actually lonesome for the first time since his
return home He had kindled a wood fire in the stove just for the
sociability of it and the crackle and glow behind the isinglass panes
only served to remind him of other days and other fires The sitting
room had not been lonesome then

He heard the depot wagon rattle by and peering from the window saw
that except for Mr Lumley it was empty Not even a summer boarder had
come to brighten our ways and lawns with reckless raiment and the newest
slang Summer boarding season was almost over now Bayport would soon be
as dull as dish water And the captain admitted to himself that it WAS
dull He had half a mind to take a flying trip to Boston make the round
of the wharves and see if any of the old shipowners and ship captains
whom he had once known were still alive and in harness

JINGLE Jingle JINGLE Jingle Jingle Jing Jing Jing

Captain Cy bounced in his chair That was the frontdoor bell The
FRONTdoor bell Who on earth or rather who in Bayport would come to
the FRONT door

He hurried through the dim grandeur of the best parlor and entered the
little dark front hall The bell was still swinging at the end of its
coil of wire The dust shaken from it still hung in the air The captain
unbolted and unlocked the big front door

A girl was standing on the steps between the lines of box hedgea
little girl under a big grownup umbrella The wet dripped from the
umbrella top and from the hem of the little girls dress

Captain Cy stared hard at his visitor he knew most of the children
in Bayport but he didnt know this one Obviously she was a stranger
Portuguese children from up Harniss way sometimes called to peddle
huckleberries but this child was no Portugee

Hello exclaimed the captain wonderingly

Did you ring the bell

Yes sir replied the girl

Humph Did hey Why

Why Why I thoughtIsnt it a truly bell Didnt it ought to ring Is
anybody sick or dead There isnt any crape

Dead Crape Captain Cy gasped What in the world put that in your
head

Well I didnt know but maybe that was why you thought I hadnt ought
to have rung it When mamma was sick they didnt let people ring our
bell And when she died they tied it up with crape

Did hey Hum The captain scratched his chin and gazed at the small
figure before him It was a selfpoised matteroffact figure for such
a little one and out there in the rain under the tent roof of the
umbrella it was rather pitiful

Please sir said the child are you Captain Cyrus Whittaker

Yup Thats me Youve guessed it the first time

Yes sir Ive got a letter for you Its pinned inside my dress If
you could hold this umbrella maybe I could get it out

She extended the big umbrella at arms length holding it with both
hands Captain Cy woke up

Good land he exclaimed what am I thinkin of Youre soakin wet
through aint you

I guess Im pretty wet Its a long ways from the depot and I tried to
come across the fields because a boy said it was nearer and the bushes
were

Across the FIELDS Have you walked all the way from the depot

Yes sir The man said it was a quarter to ride and auntie said I must
be careful of my money because

By the big dipper Come in Come in out of that this minute

He sprang down the steps furled the umbrella seized her by the arm and
led her into the house through the parlor and into the sitting room
where the fire crackled invitingly He could feel that the dress sleeve
under his hand was wet through and the worn boots and darned stockings
he could see were soaked likewise

There he cried Set down in that chair Put your feet up on that
hath Sakes alive Your folks ought to know better than to let you stir
out this weather let alone walkin a mileand no rubbers Them shoes
ought to come off this minute I spose Take em off You can dry your
stockings better that way Off with em

Yes sir said the child stooping to unbutton the shoes Her
wet fingers were blue It can be cold in our village even in early
September when there is an easterly storm Unbuttoning the shoes was
slow work

Here let me help you commanded the captain getting down on one knee
and taking a foot in his lap Tut tut tut youre wet Been some
time sence I fussed with button boots lace or longlegged cowhides come
handier Never wore cowhides did you

No sir

I spose not I used to when I was little Remember the first pair I
had Copper toes on emwhew The copper was blacked over when they
come out of the store and that wouldnt do so we used to kick a stone
wall till they brightened up There there she comes Humph stockins
soaked too Wish I had some dry ones to lend you Might give you a pair
of mine but theyd be too scant fore and aft and too broad in the beam
I callate Humph and your topriggins as wet as your hull Been on
your beam ends have you

I dont know sir I fell down in the bushes coming across There were
vines and they tripped me up And the umbrella was so heavy that

Yes I could see right off you was carryin too much canvas Now take
off your bunnit and Ill get a coat of mine to wrap you up in

He went into his bedroom and returned with a heavy reefer jacket
Ordering his caller to stand up he slipped her arms into the sleeves
and turned the collar up about her neck Her braided pigtail of yellow
hair stuck out over the collar and hung down her back in a funny
way The coat sleeves reached almost to her knees and the coat itself
enveloped her like a bed quilt

There said Captain Cy approvingly Now you look more as if you was
under a storm rig Set down and toast your toes Wheres that letter you
said you had

Its inside here I dont knows I can get at it these sleeves are so
long

Reef em Turn em up Let me show you Thats better Hum So you come
from the depot hey Live up that way

No sir I used to live in Concord but

Concord CONCORD Concord where

Concord New Hampshire I came on the cars Auntie knew a man who was
going to Boston and he said hed take care of me as far as that and
then put me on the train to come down here I stopped at his folks
house in Charlestown last night and this morning we got up early and he
bought me a ticket and started me for here I had a box with my things
in it but it was so heavy I couldnt carry it so I left it up at the
depot The man there said it would be all right and you could send for
it when

I could SEND for it _I_ could What in the worldSay child youve
made a mistake in your bearins Taint me you want to see its some of
your folks relations most likely Tell me who they are maybe I know
em

The girl sat upright in the big chair Her dark eyes opened wide and her
chin quivered

Aint you Captain Cyrus Whittaker she demanded You said you was

Yes yes I am Im Cy Whittaker but what

Well auntie told me

Auntie Auntie who

Auntie Oliver She isnt really my auntie but mamma and me lived in
her house for ever so long and so

Wait wait wait Im hull down in the fog This is gettin too thick
for ME Your aunties names Oliver and you lived in Concord New
Hampshire Forfor thunder sakes whats YOUR name

Emily Richards Thomas

EmEmilyRichardsThomas

Yes sir

Emily Richards Thomas What was your mas name

Mamma was Mrs Thomas Her front name was Mary Shes dead Dont you
want to see your letter Ive got it now

She lifted one of the flapping coat sleeves and extended a crumpled
damp envelope Captain Cy took it in a dazed fashion and drew a long
breath Then he tore open the envelope and read the following


DEAR CAPTAIN WHITTAKER

The bearer of this is Emily Richards Thomas She is seven going on
eight but old for her years Her mother was Mary Thomas that used to
be Mary Thayer It was her you wrote to about keeping house for you but
she had been dead a fortnight before your letter come She had bronchial
pneumonia and it carried her off having always been delicate and
with more troubles to bear than she could stand poor thing Since her
husband who I say was a scamp even if he is dead left her and the
baby she has took rooms with me and done sewing and such When she
passed away I wrote to Seth Howes a relation of hers out West and so
far as I know the only one she had I told the Howes man that Mary had
gone and Emmie was left Would they take her I wrote And Seths wife
wrote they couldnt being poorer than poverty themselves I was afraid
she would have to go to a Home but when your letter came I wrote the
Howeses again And Mrs Howes wrote back that you was rich and a sort
of faroff relation of Marys and probably you would be glad to take
the child to bring up Said that she had some correspondence with you
about Mary before So I send Emmie to you Somebodys got to take care
of her and I cant afford it though I would if I could for shes a
real nice child and some like her mother I do hope she can stay with
you It seems a shame to send her to the orphan asylum I send along
what clothes shes got which aint many

Respectfully yours

SARAH OLIVER


Captain Cy read the letter through Then he wiped his forehead

Well he muttered WELL I never in my life II never did Of
all

Emily Richards Thomas looked up from the depths of the coat collar

Dont you think she said that you had better send to the depot for
my box I can get dry SOME this way but mamma always made me change my
clothes as soon as I could She used to be afraid Id get cold



CHAPTER VI

ICICLES AND DUST


Captain Cy did not reply to the request for the box It is doubtful if
he even heard it Mrs Olivers astonishing letter had as he afterwards
said left him high and dry with no tug in sight Mary Thomas was
dead and her daughter her DAUGHTER of whose very existence he had
been ignorant had suddenly appeared from nowhere and been dropped at
his door like an outofseason May basket accompanied by the modest
suggestion that he assume responsibility for her thereafter No wonder
the captain wiped his forehead in utter bewilderment

Dont you think youd better send for the box repeated the child
shivering a little under the big coat

Hey What say Never mind though Just keep quiet for a spell wont
you I want to let this soak in By the big dipper Of all the solid
brass cheek that ever I run across this beats the whole cargo And
Betsy Howes never hinted Probably you would be glad to take Be
GLAD Why blast their miserable stingyWhat do they take me for ILL
show em Indiana aint so fur that I cantHey Did you say anything
sis

The girl had shivered again No sir she replied It was my teeth I
guess They kind of rattled

What You aint cold are you With all that round you and in front of
that fire

No sir I guess not Only my back feels sort of funny as if somebody
kept dropping icicles down it Those bushes and vines were so wet that
when I tumbled down twas most like being in a pond

Sho sho That wont do Cant have you laid up on my hands That would
be worse thanHumph Tut tut Somethin ought to be done and Im
blessed if I know what And not a woman round the placenot even that
Debby Say look here whats your nameerEmmie hadnt I better get
the doctor

The child looked frightened

Why she cried her big eyes opening Im not sick am I

Sick No no Course not course not What would you want to be sick
for But you ought to get warm and dry right off I spose and your
duds are all up to the depot Say what doeswhat did your ma used to
do when you felterthem icicles and things

She changed my clothes and rubbed me And if I was VERY wet she put me
to bed sometimes

Bed Sure why yes indeed Beds a good place to keep off icicles
Theres my bedroom right in there You could turn in just as well
as not Bunk aint made yet but I can shake it up in no time
Sayereryou can undress yourself cant you

Oh yes sir Course I can Im most eight

Sure you are Dont act a mite babyish All right you set still till I
shake up that bunk

He entered the chamber his own opening from the sitting room and
proceeded literally to shake up the bed It was not a lengthy
process and when it was completed he returned to find his visitor
already divested of the coat and standing before the stove

I guess perhaps youll have to help undo me behind observed the young
lady This is my best dress and I cant reach the buttons in the middle
of the back

Captain Cy scratched his head Then he clumsily unbuttoned the wet
waist glancing rather sheepishly at the window to see if anyone was
coming

So this is your best dress hey he asked to cover his confusion
It was obviously not very new for it was neatly mended in one or two
places

Yes sir

So Whered you buy itup to Concord

No sir Mamma made it a year ago

There was a little choke in the childs voice The captain was mightily
taken back

Hum Yes yes he muttered hurriedly Well there you are Now you
can get along cant you

Yes sir Shall I go in that room

Trot right in You mightermaybe you might sing out when youre
tucked up IIll want to know if youre got bedclothes enough

Emily disappeared in the bedroom The door closed Captain Cy his hands
in his pockets walked up and down the length of the sitting room The
expression on his face was a queer one

I havent got any nightgown called a voice from the other room The
captain gasped

Good land so you aint he exclaimed What in the worldHumph I
wonder

He went to the lower drawer of a tall highboy and from the tumbled
mass of apparel therein took one of his own night garments

Heres one he said coming back with it in his hand I guess youll
have to make this do for now Itll fit you enough for three times to
once but its all Ive got

A small hand reached round the edge of the door and the nightshirt
disappeared Captain Cy chuckled and resumed his pacing

Im tucked up called Miss Thomas The captain entered and found her
in bed the patchwork points and diamonds of the Rising Sun quilt
covering her to the chin and her head denting the uppermost of the two
big pillows Captain Cy liked to sleep high

Got enough over you he asked

Yes sir thank you

Thats good Ill take your togs out and dry em in the kitchen Dont
be scared Ill be right back

In the kitchen he sorted the wet garments and hung them about the
cook stove It was a strange occupation for him and he shook his head
whimsically as he completed it Then he took a flat iron one of Mrs
Beasleys purchases from the shelf in the closet and put it in the oven
to heat Soon afterwards he returned to the bedroom bearing the iron
wrapped in a dish towel

My ma always used to put a hot flat to my feet when I was a young one
and got chilled he explained I aint used one for some time but I
guess its a good receipt How do you feel now Any more icicles

No sir Im ever so warm Isnt this a nice bed

Think so do you Glad of it Well now Im goin to leave you in it
while I step down street and see about havin your box sent for Ill be
back in a shake If anybody comes to the door while Im gone dont you
worry let em go away again

He put on his hat and left the house walking rapidly his head down and
his hands in his pockets At times he would pause in his walk whistle
shake his head and go on once more Josiah Dimick met him and his
answers to Josiahs questions were so vague and irrelevant that Captain
Dimick was puzzled and later expressed the opinion that Whits cookin
must be pretty bad acted to me as if he had dyspepsy of the brain

Captain Cy stopped at Mr Lumleys residence to leave an order for the
delivery of the box Then he drifted into Simmonss and accosted Alpheus
Smalley

Al he said whats good for a cold

Why asked Mr Smalley in true Yankee fashion You got one

Hey Oh yes Yes Ive got one By way of proof he coughed until the
lamp chimneys rattled on the shelf

Judas I should think you had Well theres Pine Bark Oil and
Sassafras Elixir and two kinds of sassprillathats good for most
everythingandIs your throat sore

Hey Yes I guess so

Dont you KNOW If youve got sore throat there aint nothin bettern
Arabian Balsam But what in time are you doin out in this drizzle
with a cold and no umbrella Do you want to

Never mind my umbrella I left it in the church entry tother Sunday
and somebody got out afore I did This Arabian Balsamseems to me I
remember my mas usin that on me Wet a rag with it dont you and tie
it round your neck

Yup Be sure and use a flannel rag and red flannel if youve got it
that acts quickern the other kinds Fifteen cent bottle

I guess so Mights well give me some sassprilla while youre about
it always handy to have in the house Andersay is that canned soup
youve got up on that shelf

The astonished clerk admitted that it was

Well give me a can of the chicken kind

Mr Smalley standing on a chair to reach the shelf where the soup was
kept shook his head

Now thats too bad Capn he said but were all out of chicken
just now Fact is we aint got nothin but termatter and beef broth
Yes and I declare if the termatter aint all gone

Humph then I guess Ill take the beef Neednt mind wrappin it up So
long

He departed bearing his purchases When Mr Simmons proprietor of
the store returned Alpheus told him that he callated Captain Cy
Whittaker was preparing to go into a decline or somethin

Anyhow said Alpheus he bought sassprilla and Arabian Balsam
and I sold him a can of that beef soup you bought three year ago last
summer when Alicia Atkins had the chicken pox

The captain entered the house quietly and tiptoed to the door of the
bedroom Emily was asleep and the sight of the childish head upon the
pillow gave him a start as he peeped in at it It looked so natural
almost as if it belonged there It had been in a bed like that and in
that very room that he had slept when a boy

Gabe brimful of curiosity brought the box a little later His
curiosity was ungratified Captain Cyrus explaining that it was a
package he had been expecting The captain took the box to the bedroom
and finding the child still asleep deposited it on the floor and
tiptoed out again He went to the kitchen poked up the fire and set
about getting dinner

He was warming the beef broth in a saucepan on the stove when Emily
appeared She was dressed in dry clothes from the box and seemed to be
feeling as good as new

Hello exclaimed Captain Cy Youre on deck again hey Hows
icicles

All gone was the reply Do you do your own work Cant I help I can
set the table I used to for Mrs Oliver

The captain protested that he could do it himself just as well but
the girl persisting he showed her where the dishes were kept From the
corner of his eye he watched her as she unfolded the tablecloth

Is this the only one youve got she inquired Its awful dirty

Hum Yes I aint tended up to my washin and ironin the way Id ought
to Ill lose my job if I dont look out hey

Before they sat down to the meal Captain Cy insisted that his guest
take a tablespoonful of the sarsaparilla and decorate her throat with
a section of red flannel soaked in the Arabian Balsam The perfume of
the latter was penetrating and might have interfered with a less healthy
appetite than that of Miss Thomas

Have some soup Some I bought purpose for you Best thing goin for
folks with icicles remarked the captain waving the iron spoon he had
used to stir the contents of the saucepan

Yes sir thank you But dont you ask a blessing

Hey

A blessing you know Saying that youre thankful for the food now set
before us

Hum Why to tell you the truth Ive kind of neglected that Im
afraid Bein thankful for the grub Ive had lately was most too much of
a strain I shouldnt wonder

I know the one mamma used to say Shall I ask it for you

Sho I guess so if you want to

The girl bent her head and repeated a short grace Captain Cy watched
her curiously

Now Ill have some soup please observed Emily Im awful hungry
I had breakfast at five oclock this morning and we didnt have a chance
to eat much

A good many times that day the captain caught himself wondering if he
wasnt dreaming The whole affair seemed too ridiculous to be an actual
experience Dinner over he and Emmie attended to the dishes he washing
and she wiping And even at this early stage of their acquaintance her
disposition to take charge of things was apparent She found fault with
the dish towels they were almost as bad as the tablecloth she said
Considering that the same set had been in use since Mrs Beasleys
departure the criticism was not altogether baseless But the young lady
did not stop thereher companions skill as a washer was questioned

Excuse me she said but dont you think that plate had better be
done over I guess you didnt see that place in the corner Perhaps
youve forgot your specs Auntie Oliver couldnt see well without her
specs

Captain Cy grinned and admitted that a second washing wouldnt hurt the
plate

I guess your auntie was one of the particular kind he said

No sir twas mamma She couldnt bear dirty things Auntie used to
say that mamma hunted dust with a magnifying glass She didnt though
she only liked to be neat I guess dust doesnt worry men so much as it
does women

Why

Oh cause theres so much of it here dont you think so Ill help
you clean up by and by if you want to

YOU will

Yes sir I used to dust sometimes when mamma was out sewing And once
I swept but I did it so hard that auntie wouldnt let me any more She
said twas like trying to blow out a match with a tornado

Later on he found her standing in the sitting room critically
inspecting the mats the furniture and the pictures on the walls He
stood watching her for a moment and then asked

Well what are you lookin formore dust Twont be hard to find it
Dust thou art and unto dust thou shalt return Every time I go outdoor
and come in again I realize how true that is

Emily shook her head

No sir she said I was only looking at things and thinking

Thinkin hey What about or is that a secret

No sir I was thinking that this room was different from any Ive ever
seen

Humph Yes I presume likely tis Dont like it very much do you

Yes sir I think I do Its got a good many things in it that I never
saw before but I guess theyre prettyafter you get used to em

Captain Cy laughed aloud After you get used to em hey he repeated

Yes sir Thats what mamma said about Auntie Olivers new bonnet that
she made herself II was thinking that you must be peculiar

Peculiar

Yes sir I like peculiar people Im peculiar myself Auntie used to
say I was the most peculiar child she ever saw Praps thats why I came
to you Praps God meant for peculiar ones to live together Dont you
think maybe that was it

And the captain having no answer ready said nothing

That evening when Asaph and Bailey coming for their usual call peeped
in at the window they were astounded by the tableau in the Whittaker
sitting room Captain Cy was seated in the rocking chair which had been
his grandfathers At his feet on the walnut cricket with a haircloth
top sat a little girl turning over the leaves of a tattered magazine
a Godeys Ladys Book A pile of these magazines was beside her on the
floor The captain was smiling and looking over her shoulder The cat
was curled up in another chair The room looked more homelike than it
had since its owner returned to it

The friends entered without knocking Captain Cy looked up saw them
and appeared embarrassed

Hello boys he said Glad to see you Come right in Clearin off
fine aint it

Mr Tidditt replied absently that he wouldnt be surprised if it was
Bailey his eyes fixed upon the occupant of the cricket said nothing

Wewe didnt know you had company Whit said Asaph We been up to
Simmonss and Alpheus said you was thin and peaked and looked sick Said
you bought sassprilla and all kind of truck He was afraid you had
fever and was out of your head cruisin round in the rain with no
umbrella The gang werent talkin of nothin else so me and Bailey
thought wed come right down

Thats kind of you Im sure Take your things off and set down No
Im sorry to disappoint Smalley and the rest but Im able to be up
andermake my own bed thank you So Alpheus thought I looked thin
hey Well if I had to live on that soup he sold me Id be thinnern I
am now You tell him that canned hot water is all right if you like it
but it seems a shame to put mud in it It only changes the color and
dont help the taste

Mr Bangs who was still staring at Emily now ventured a remark

Is that a relation of yours Cy he asked

That Oh Well no not exactly And yet I dont know but she is
Fellers this is Emmie Thomas Cant you shake hands Emmie

The child rose laid down the magazine which was open at the colored
picture of a group of ladies in crinoline and chignons and going
across the room extended a hand to Mr Tidditt

How do you do sir she said

Whyerhow dye do Im pretty smart thank you Hows yourself

Im better now I guess the sassparilla was good for me

Twant the sassprilla observed the captain with conviction
Twas the Arabian Balsam Ma always cured me with it and theres
nothin finer

But what in time began Bailey Captain Cy glanced at the child and
then at the clock

Dont you think youd better turn in now Emmie he said hastily
cutting off the remainder of the Bangs query Its after eight and
when I was little I was abed afore that

Emily obediently turned gathered up the Ladys Books and replaced them
in the closet Then she went to the dining room and came back with a
hand lamp

Good night she said addressing the visitors Then coming close to
the captain she put her face up for a kiss

Good night she said to him adding I like it here ever so much Im
awful glad you let me stay

As Bailey told Asaph afterwards Captain Cy blushed until the ends of
the red lapped over at the nape of his neck However he bent and kissed
the rosy lips and then quickly brushed his own with his hand

Yes yes he stammered Wellergood night Pleasant dreams to you
See you in the mornin

The girl paused at the chamber door You wont have to unbutton my
waist now she said This is my other one and it aint that kind

The door closed The captain without looking at his friends led the
way to the dining room

Come on out here he whispered We can talk better here

Naturally they wanted to know all about the girl who she was and where
she came from Captain Cy told as much of the history of the affair as
he thought necessary

Poor young one he concluded she landed on to me in the rain
soppin wet and haf sick I COULDNT turn her out thennobody could
Course its an everlastin outrage on me and the cheekiest thing ever I
heard of but what could I do I was fixed a good deal like an English
feller by the name of Gatenby that I used to know in South America He
woke up in the middle of the night and found a boa constrictor curled on
the foot of his bed Next day when a crowd of us happened in there
was Gatenby white as a sheet starin down at the snake and it sound
asleep I didnt invite him he says but he looked so bloomin
comftable I adnt the eart to disturb im Same way with me
the child seemed so comftable here I aint had the heart to disturb
heryet

But she said she was goin to stay put in Bailey You aint goin to
KEEP her are you

The captains indignation was intense

Whome he snorted What do you think I am I aint runnin an
orphan asylum No sir Ill keep the young one a day or soor maybe a
weekand then Ill pack her off to Betsy Howes I aint so soft as they
think I am ILL show em

Mr Tidditt looked thoughtful

Shes a kind of cute little girl aint she he observed

Captain Cys frown vanished and a smile took its place

Thats so he chuckled She is now thats a fact I dont knows I
ever saw a cuter



CHAPTER VII

CAPTAIN CY PROVES DELINQUENT


A week isnt a very long time even in Bayport True there was once a
drummer for a Boston notion house who sprained his ankle on the icy
sidewalk in front of Simmonss and was therefore obliged to remain in
the front bedroom of the perfect boarding house for seven whole days He
is quoted as saying that next time he hoped he might break his neck

Brother asked the shocked Rev Mr Daniels who was calling upon the
stranger are you prepared to face eternity

What was the energetic reply After a week in this town and in this
bedroom Look here Mister if you want to scare me about the future you
just hint that theyll put me on a straw tick in an ice chest Anything
hot and lively ll only be tempting after this

But to us who live here throughout the year a week soon passes And
the end of the week following Emily Thomass arrival at the Cy Whittaker
place found the little girl still there and apparently no nearer being
shipped to Indiana than when she came Not so near if Mr Tidditts
opinion counts for anything

Gone he repeated scoffingly in reply to Bailey Bangss question
Course she aint gone And whats more she aint goin to go Whits
got so already that he wouldnt part with her no moren hed cut off his
hand

But he keeps SAYIN shes got to go Only yesterday he was tellin how
Betsyd feel when the girl landed on her with his letter in her pocket

Sayin dont count for nothin Zoeth Cahoon keeps SAYIN hes goin to
stop drinkin but he only stops long enough to catch his breath Cys
tellin himself fairy yarns and he hopes he believes em Man alive
cant you SEE Aint he gettin more foolish over the young one every
day Dont she boss him round like the overseer on a cranberry swamp
Dont he look more contented than he has sence he got off the cars I
tell you Bailey that child fills a place in Whits life thats been
runnin to seed and needed weedin Nothin could fill it betterunless
twas a nice wife

WIFE Oh DO be still I believe youre womanstruck and at an age when
it hadnt ought to be catchin no moren whoopin cough

Mr Bangs and the town clerk were the only ones except Captain Cy who
knew the whole truth concerning the little girl Not that the childs
arrival wasnt noted and vigorously discussed by a large portion of the
townspeople Emily had not been in the Whittaker house two days before
Angeline Phinney called hot on the trail of gossip and sensation But
persistent as Angeline was she departed knowing not quite as much as
when she came The interview between Miss Phinney and the captain must
have been interesting judging by the ladys account of it

I never see such a man in my born days declared Angie disgustedly
You couldnt get nothin out of him Not that he want pleasant and
sociable land sakes he acted as glad to see me as if I was his rich
aunt come on a visit And he was willin to talk too Thats the
trouble he done ALL the talkin I happened to mention just as a sort
of starter you know somethin about the cranbry crop this fall and
after that all he could say was cranbries cranbries cranbries
Hear youve got compny says I Did you says he Now aint it
strange how thingsll get spread around Only yesterday I heard that Joe
Dimicks swamp was just loaded down with early blacks And yet when
I went over to look at it there didnt seem to be so many There aint
much better cranbries anywhere than our early blacks he says You
take em And so on and so on and so on _I_ didnt care nothin
about the dratted early blacks but he didnt seem to care for nothin
else He talked cranbries steady for an hour and a half and I left
that house with my mouth all puckered up its tasted sour ever sence I
never see such a man

When Captain Cy was questioned by Asaph concerning the acid
conversation he grinned

I didnt know you was so interested in cranbries observed Tidditt

I aint was the reply but Im more interested in em than I am in
Angie I see she was sufferin from a rush of curiosity to the head
and I cured her by homeopath doses Every time she opened her mouth I
dropped an early black into it Its a good receipt you tell Bailey
to try it on Ketury some time

To his chums the captain was emphatic in his orders that secrecy be
preserved No one was to be told who the child was or where she came
from What they dont know wont hurt em any declared Captain Cy
And Emilys answer to inquiring souls who would fain have delved into
her past was to the effect that Uncle Cyrus didnt like to have her
talk about herself

I dont knows Im ashamed of anything Ive done so far said the
captain but I aint braggin either Time enough to talk when I send
her back to Betsy

That time apparently was not in the near future The girl stayed on
at the Whittaker place and grew to be more and more a part of it At the
end of the second week Captain Cy began calling her Bosn

A bosns a mighty handy man aboard ship he explained and youre
so handy here that it fits in first rate And besides it sounds so
natural My dad called me Bosn when I was little

Emily accepted the title complacently She was quite contented to be
called almost anything so long as she was permitted to stay with her
new friend Already the bosn had taken charge of the deck and the rest
of the ships company Captain Cy and Lonesome the cat obeyed her
orders

On the second Sunday morning after her arrival Bosn suggested that
she and Captain Cy go to church

Mother and I always went at home she said And Auntie Oliver used to
say meeting was a good thing for those that needed it

Think I need it do you asked the captain who in shirt sleeves and
slippers had prepared for a quiet forenoon with his pipe and the Boston
Transcript

I dont know sir I heard what you said when Lonesome ate up the
steak and I thought maybe you hadnt been for a long time I guess
churches are different in South America

So they went to church and sat in the old Whittaker pew The captain had
been there once before when he first returned to Bayport but the sermon
was more somnolent than edifying and he hadnt repeated the experiment
The pair attracted much attention Fragments of a conversation heard
by Captain Cy as they emerged into the vestibule had momentous
consequences

Kind of a pretty child aint she commented Mrs Eben Salters
patting her false front into place under the eaves of her Sunday bonnet

Pretty enough in the face sniffed Mrs Tad Simpson who was wearing
her black silk for the first time since its third makingover Pretty
enough that way I spose But my land look at the way shes
rigged Old dress darned and patched up and all outgrown If I had
Cy Whittakers money Id be ashamed to have a relation of mine come to
meetin that way Even if her folks was poorern Jobs off ox Id spend
a little on my own account and trust to getting it back some time Id
have more care for my own selfrespect Look at Alicia Atkins See how
nice she looks Them feathers on her hat must have cost somethin I bet
you Howdy do Licia dear Whens your pa comin home

The Honorable Heman had left town on a business trip to the South
Alicia was accompanied by the Atkins housekeeper and as usual was
garbed regardless of expense

Mrs Salters smiled sweetly upon the Atkins heir and then added in a
church whisper Dont she look sweet I agree with you Sarah it is
strange how Captain Whittaker lets his little niece go And him rich

Niece repeated Mrs Simpson eagerly Who said twas his niece I
heard twas a child hed adopted out of a home Theres all sorts of
queer yarns about IOh good mornin Capn Cyrus How DO you do

The captain grunted an answer to the effect that he was bearing up
pretty well considering There was a scowl on his face and he spoke
little as holding Emily by the hand he led the way home That evening
he dropped in at the perfect boarding house and begged to know if Mrs
Bangs had any fashion books around that she didnt want

I meanerermagazines with pictures of womens duds in em he
stammered in explanation Bosn likes to look at em Shes great on
fashion books Bosn is

Keturah got together a half dozen numbers of the Home Dressmaker and
other periodicals of a similar nature The captain took them under his
arm and departed whispering to Mr Tidditt as he passed the latter in
the hall

Come up by and by Ase I want to talk to you Bring Bailey along if
you can do it without startin divorce proceedings

Later when the trio gathered in the Whittaker sitting room Captain Cy
produced the fashion books and spoke concerning them

You see he said IIve been thinkin that BosnEmily that
iswant rigged exactly the way she ought to be Have you fellers
noticed it

His friends seemed surprised Neither was ready with an immediate
answer so the captain went on

Course I dont mean she aint got canvas enough to cover her spars he
explained but what she has got has seen considerble weather and it
seemed to me twas pretty nigh time to haul her into dry dock and refit
Thats why I borrowed these magazines of Ketury Ive been lookin them
over and there seems to be plenty of riggin for small craft the only
thing is I dont know whats the right cut for her build Bailey youre
a married man you ought to know somethin about womens clothes What
do you think of this now

He opened one of the magazines and pointed to the picture of a young
girl with a waspy waist and Lilliputian feet who arrayed in flounces
and furbelows was toddling gingerly down a flight of marble steps She
carried a parasol in one hand and the other held the end of a chain to
which a longhaired dog was attached

The town clerk and his companion inspected the young lady with
deliberation and interest

Well what do you say demanded Captain Cy

I dont care much for them kind of dogs observed Asaph thoughtfully

Good land you dont spose they heave the dog in with the clothes for
good measure do you Bailey whats your opinion

Mr Bangs looked wise

I should say he said yes sir I should say that was a real
stylish rigout Only thing is that girl is considerble less
fleshy than Emily This one looks to me as if she was breakin in two
amidships Still I spose likely the duds dont come ready made so
they could be let out some to fit Whats the price of a suit like
that Whit

The captain looked at the printed number beneath the fashion plate and
then turned to the description in the text

Afternoon gown for miss of sixteen he read Humph that settles
that first crack Bosn aint but half of sixteen

Anyway put in Asaph you need somethin she could wear forenoons if
she wanted to Whats this one She looks young enough

The one referred to turned out to be a coat for child of four
It was therefore scornfully rejected One after another the different
magazines were examined and the pictures discussed At length a costume
for miss of eight years was pronounced to be pretty nearly the thing

Godfrey scissors exclaimed the admiring Mr Tidditt Thats mighty
swell aint it Whats the stuff goes into that Cy

Material batiste trimmed with embroidered batiste What in time is
batiste

I dont know Do you Bailey

No never heard of it Ketury never had nothin like that Im sure
French I shouldnt wonder Well Keturys down on the French ever sence
she read about Napoleon leavin his fust wife to take up with another
woman Does it say any more

Lets see Makes a beautiful gown for evening or summer wear Summer
Why by the big dipper were aground again Bosn dont want summer
clothes Its comin on winter

He threw the magazine on the floor rubbed his forehead and then burst
into a laugh

For goodness sake dont tell anybody about this business boys he
said I guess I must be havin an early spring of second childhood But
when I heard those women at the meetin house goin on about how pretty
Licia Atkins was got up and how mean and shabby Bosn looked it made
me bile And by the big dipper I WILL show em somethin afore I get
through too Only dressin little girls is some off my usual course
Bailey does Ketury make her own duds

Why no Course she helps and stands by for orders but Effie Taylor
comes and takes the wheel while the riggins goin on Effies a
dressmaker and

There See Ase It IS some good to have a married man aboard after
all A dressmakers what we want Ill hunt up Effie tomorrow

And hunt her up he did with the result that Miss Taylor came to the
Whittaker place each day during the following week and Emily was as
the captain said rigged out fresh from main truck to keelson In this
rigging Captain Cy and his two partnersJosiah Dimick had already
christened the pair The Board of Strategytook a marked interest
They were on hand when each new garment was tried on and they approved
or criticised as seemed to them best

Aint that kind of sober lookin for a young one like Bosn asked the
captain referring to one of the new gowns I dont want her to look as
if she was dressed cheap

Land sakes mumbled Miss Taylor her mouth full of pins There aint
anything cheap about it and youll find it out when you get the bill
Thats a nice rich sensible suit

I know but its so everlastin quiet Dont you think a little yellow
and black or some red strung along the yards would sort of liven it
up Why you ought to see them Greaser girls down in South America of a
Sunday afternoon Color and go Jerushy theyd pretty nigh knock your
eye out

The dressmaker sniffed disdain

Capn Whittaker she retorted if you want this child to look like an
Indian squaw or a barbers pole youll have to get somebody else to do
it Im used to dressing Christians not yeller and black heathen women
Red strung along a skirt like that I never did

There there Effie Dont get the barometer fallin I was only
suggestin you know What do you think Bosn

Why Uncle Cyrus I dont believe I should like red very much nor the
other colors either I like this just as it is

So Well youre the doctor Maybe youre right I wouldnt want you
to look like a barbers pole Dont love Tad Simpson enough to want to
advertise his business

Miss Taylors coming had other results besides the refitting of Bosn
She found much fault with the captains housekeeping It developed that
her sister Georgiana who had been working in a Brockton shoe shop was
now at home and might be engaged to attend to the household duties
at the Whittaker establishment provided she was allowed to go home
nights Georgiana was engaged on trial and did well So that problem
was solved

School in Bayport opens the first week in October Of late there has
been a movement headed by some of the townspeople who think city ways
are best to have the term begin in September But this idea has little
chance of success as long as cranberry picking continues to be our
leading industry So many of the children help out the family means by
picking cranberries in the fall that school until the picking season
was over would be slimly attended

The last week in September found us all discussing the coming of the new
downstairs teacher Miss Phoebe Dawes Since it was definitely settled
that she was to come the opposition had died down and was less
openly expressed but it was there all the same beneath the surface
Congressman Atkins had accepted the surprising defiance of his wish with
calm dignity and the philosophy of the truly great who are not troubled
by trifles His lieutenant Tad Simpson quoted him as saying that of
course the will of the school committee was paramount and he as all
good citizens should bowed to their verdict Far be it from me so
the great man proclaimed to desire that my opinion should carry more
weight than that of the humblest of my friends and neighbors Speaking
as one whose knowledge of the world was perhapsermore extensive
thanerothers I favored the Normal School candidate But the persons
chosen to select thoughtor appeared to thinkotherwise I therefore
say nothing and await developments

This attitude was considered by most of us to reflect credit upon Mr
Atkins There were a few scoffers however When the proclamation was
repeated to Captain Cy he smiled

Alpheus he said to Mr Smalley his informant you didnt use to
know Deacon Zeb Clark who lived up by the salt works in my granddads
time hey No course you didnt Well the deacon was a great believer
in his own judgment One time it bein Saturday his wife wanted him to
pump the washtub full and take a bath He said no said the cistern
was awful low and twould use up all the water She said no such thing
there was water aplenty To prove she was wrong he went and pried the
cistern cover off to look and fell in Mrs Clark peeked down and saw
him there standin up to his neck

Tabby says he you would have your way and Im takin the bath
But you can see for yourself that well have to cart water from now on
However _I_ aint responsible throw me down the soap and towel

Humph grunted Smalley I dont see what thats got to do with it
Heman aint takin no bath

I dont knows its got anything to do with it But he kind of made me
think of Zeb all the same

The first day of school was of course a Monday On Sunday afternoon
Captain Cy and Bosn went for a walk These walks had become a regular
part of the Sabbath programme the weather of course permitting After
church the pair came home for dinner The meal being eaten the captain
would light a cigara pipe was now hardly dressedup enough for
Sundayand taking his small partner by the hand would lead the way
across the fields through the pines and down by the meadow short
cut to the cemetery The cemetery is a favorite Sabbath resort for the
natives of Bayport who usually speak of it as the graveyard It is a
pleasant shady spot and to visit it is considered quite respectable
and in keeping with the day and a due regard for decorum The ungodly
meaning the summer boarders and the village noaccounts seem to
prefer the beach and the fish houses but the cemetery attracts the
churchgoers One may gossip concerning the probable cost of a new
tombstone and still remain faithful to the most rigid creed

Captain Cy was not strictly speaking a religious man according to
Bayport standards Between his attendance to churchly duties and that of
the Honorable Heman Atkins there was a great gulf fixed But he rather
liked to visit the graveyard on Sunday afternoons His mother had been
used to stroll there with him in his boyhood and it pleased him to
follow in her footsteps

So he and Bosn walked along the grasscovered paths between the
ironfenced lots of the welltodo and the humble mounds and simple
slabs where the poor were sleeping past the sumptuous granite shaft of
the Atkins lot and the tilted mossy stone which told how Edwin Simpson
our only son had been accidentally shot in the West Indies out
through the back gate and up the hill to the pine grove overlooking the
bay Here on a scented carpet of pine needles they sat them down to
rest and chat

Emily her small knees drawn up and encircled by her arms looked out
across the flats now half covered with the rising tide It was a mild
day more like August than October and there was almost no wind The
sun was shining on the shallow water and the sand beneath it showed
yellow checkered and marbled with dark green streaks and patches where
the weedbordered channels wound tortuously On the horizon the sand
hills of Wellmouth notched the blue sky The girl drew a long breath

Oh she exclaimed Isnt this just lovely I do like the sea an awful
lot

Thats natural enough replied her companion Theres a big streak
of salt water in your blood on your mas side It pulls that kind of a
streak does Theres days when I feel uneasy every minute and hanker for
a deck underneath me The settin room floor stays altogether too quiet
on a day like that Id like to feel it heavin over a ground swell

Say Bosn he said a few minutes later Ive been thinkin about
you Youve been to school havent you

Course I have was the rather indignant answer I went two years in
Concord Mamma used to help me nights too I can read almost all the
little words Dont I help you read your paper most every night

Sartin you do Yes yes Well our school opens tomorrer and Ive been
thinkin that maybe youd better go Theres a new teacher comin and I
hear shes pretty good

Dont you KNOW Why Mr Tidditt said you was the one that got her to
come here

Yes well Asaph says most everything but his prayers Still he aint
fur off this time I callate I was some responsible for her bein voted
in Yet I dont really know anything about her You see Iwell never
mind What do you think Want to go

Bosn looked troubled

Id like to she said Course I want to learn how to read the big
words too But I like to stay at home with you more

You do hey Sho sho Well I guess I can get along between times
Georgianas there to keep me straight and shell see to the dust and the
dishes I guess youd better go tomorrer mornin and see how you like
it anyhow

The child thought for a moment

I think youre awful good she said I like you next to mamma even
better than Auntie Oliver I printed a letter to her the other day I
told her you were better than we expected and I had decided to live with
you always

Captain Cy was startled Considering that only the day before he
had repeated to Bailey the declaration that the arrangement was but
temporary and that Betsy Howes was escaping responsibility only for a
month or so he scarcely knew what to say

Humph he grunted Youve decided it have you Well well see Now
you trot around and have a good time Im goin to have another smoke
Ill be here when you get back

Bosn wandered off in search of late golden rod The captain smoked and
meditated By and by the puffs were less frequent and the cigar went
out It fell from his fingers With his back against a pine tree Captain
Cy dozed peacefully

He awoke with a jump Something had awakened him but he did not know
what He blinked and gazed about him Then he heard a faint scream

Uncle screamed Bosn Oooh Uncle Cyrus help me Come quick

The next moment the captain was plunging through the scrub of
huckleberry and bayberry bushes bumping into pines and smashing the
branches aside as he ran in the direction of the call

Back of the pine grove was a big inclosed pasture nearly a quarter of
a mile long Its rear boundary was the iron fence of the cemetery The
other three sides were marked by rail fences and a stone wall As the
captain floundered from the grove and vaulted the rail fence he swore
aloud

By the big dipper he groaned its that cussed heifer I forgot her
Keep dodgin Bosn girl Im comin

The pasture was tenanted by a red and white cow belonging to Sylvanus
Cahoon Whether or not the animal had during her calfhood days been
injured by a woman is not known possibly her behavior was due merely
to innate depravity At any rate she cherished a mortal hatred toward
human beings of her own sex With men and boys she was meek enough but
no person wearing skirts and alone might venture in that field without
being chased by that cow What would happen if the pursued one was
caught could only be surmised for so far no female had permitted
herself to be caught Few would come even so near as the other side of
the pasture walls

Bosn had forgotten the cow She had gone from one goldenrod clump to
another until she had traversed nearly the length of the field Then the
vicious creature had appeared from behind a knoll in the pasture and
head down and bellowing wickedly had rushed upon her When the captain
reached the faroff fence the little girl was dodging from one dwarf
pine to the next with the cow in pursuit The pines were few and Bosn
was nearly at the end of her defenses

Help she screamed Oh uncle where are you What shall I do

Captain Cy roared in answer

Keep it up he yelled Im acomin Shoot you everlastin critter
Ill break your back for you

The cow didnt understand English it seemed even such vigorous English
as the captain was using Emily dodged to the last pine The animal was
close upon her Her rescuer was still far away

And then the cemetery gate opened and another person entered the
pasture A small persona woman She said nothing but picking up her
skirts ran straight toward the cow heedless of the latters reputation
and vicious appearance One hand clutched the gathered skirts In the
other she held a book

Dont be scared dear she called reassuringly Then to the cow Stop
it Go away you wicked thing

The animal heard the voice and turned Seeing that the newcomer was only
a woman she lowered her head and pawed the ground

Run for the gate little girl commanded the rescuer Run quick
Bosn obeyed She made a desperate dash from her pine across the open
space and in another moment was safe inside the cemetery fence

Scat Go home ordered the lady advancing toward the cow and shaking
the book at her as if the volume was some sort of deadly weapon
Arent you ashamed of yourself Go away You neednt growl at me Im
not a bit afraid of you

The growling was the muttered bellow with which the cow was wont
to terrorize her feminine victims But this victim refused to be
terrorized Instead of screaming and running she continued to advance
brandishing the book and repeating her orders that the creature go
home at once The cow did not know what to make of it Before she could
decide whether to charge or retreat a goodsized stick descended
upon her back with a whack that settled the question Captain Cy had
reached the scene of battle

Then the rescuers courage seemed to desert her for she ran back to
the cemetery even faster than she had run from it When the indignant
captain having pursued and chastised the cow until the stick was but
a splintered remnant reached the haven behind the iron fence he found
her soothing the frightened Bosn who was sobbing and hysterical

Emily saw her Uncle Cyrus coming and rushed into his arms He picked
her up and holding her with a grip which testified to the nerve strain
he had been under stepped forward to meet the stranger whose coming
had been so opportune

And she WAS a stranger The captain knew most of Bayports inhabitants
by this time or thought he did but he did not know her She was a
small woman quietly dressed and her hair under a neat black and white
hat was brown The hat was now a trifle to one side and the hair was
the least bit disarranged an effect not at all unbecoming She was
tucking in the stray wisps as the captain with Bosn in his arms came
up

Well maam puffed Captain Cy WELL maam I must say that was
the slickest pluckiest thing ever I saw anywheres I dont know what
wouldII declare I dont know how to thank you

The lady looked at him a moment before replying Then she began to
laugh a jolly laugh that was pleasant to hear

Dont try please she said chokingly It wasnt anything Oh mercy
me Im all out of breath You see I had been warned about that cow
when I started to walk this afternoon So when I saw her chasing your
poor little girl here I knew right away what was the matter It must
have been foolish enough to look at Im used to dogs and cats but I
havent had many pet cows I told her to go home and to scat and
all sorts of things Wonder I didnt tell her to lie down And the way I
shook that ridiculous book at her was

She laughed again and the captain and Bosn joined in the laugh in
spite of the fright they both had experienced

That book was dry enough to frighten almost anything continued the
lady It was one I took from the table before I left the place where
Im staying and a duller collection of sermons I never saw Oh dear
   there Is my hat any more respectable now

Yesm Its about on an even keel I should say But I must tell you
maam you done simply great and

Seems to me the people who own that cow must be a poor set to let her
make such a nuisance of herself Did your daughter run away from you

Well you see maam she aint really my daughter Bosn herethats
my nickname for her maamshe and I was out walkin I set down in the
pines and I guess I must have dozed off Anyhow when I woke up she was
gone and the first thing I knew of this scrape was hearin her hail

The little womans manner changed Her gray eyes flashed indignantly

You dozed off she repeated With a little girl in your charge and
in the very next lot to that cow Didnt you know the creature chased
women and girls

Why yes Id heard of it but

It wasnt Uncle Cyruss fault put in Bosn eagerly It was mine I
went away by myself

Beyond shifting her gaze to the child the lady paid no attention to this
remark

What do you think her mother ll say when she sees that dress she
asked

It was Emilys best gown the finest of the new rig out prepared by
Miss Taylor The girl and Captain Cy gazed ruefully at the rents and
pitch stains made by the vines and pine trees

Well you see replied the abashed captain the fact is she aint
got any mother

Oh I beg your pardon And hers too poor dear Well if I were you I
shouldnt go to sleep next time I took her walking Good afternoon

She turned and calmly walked down the path At the bend she spoke again

I should be gentle with her if I were you she said Her nerves are
pretty well upset Besides if youll excuse my saying so I dont think
she is the one that needs scolding

They thought she had gone but she turned once more to add a final
suggestion

I think that dress could be fixed she said if you took it to some
one who knew about such things

She disappeared amidst the graveyard shrubbery Captain Cy and Bosn
slowly followed her From the pasture the red and white cow sent after
them a brokenspirited Moo

Bosn was highly indignant During the homeward walk she sputtered like
a damp firecracker

The idea of her talking so to you Uncle Cyrus she exclaimed It
wasnt your fault at all

The captain smiled onesidedly

I dont know about that shipmate he said I wouldnt wonder if she
was more than half right But say she was all business and no frills
wasnt she Ha ha How she did spunk up to that heifer Who in the
dickens do you callate she is



CHAPTER VIII

THE COW LADY


That question was answered the very next day Bosn carefully dressed
by Georgianna under the captains supervision and weighted down with
advice and counsel from the latter started for the schoolhouse at a
quarter to nine Only a sense of shame kept Captain Cy from walking
to school with her He spent a miserable forenoon They were quite the
longest three hours in his varied experience The house was dreadfully
lonely He wandered from kitchen to sitting room worried Georgianna
woke up the cat and made a complete nuisance of himself Twelve oclock
found him leaning over the gate and looking eagerly in the direction of
the schoolhouse

Bosn ran all the way home She was in a high state of excitement

What do you think Uncle Cyrus she cried What DO you think Ive
found out who the cow lady is

The cow lady Oh yes yes Have you Who is she

Shes teacher thats who she is

The captain was astonished

No he exclaimed Phoebe Dawes You dont say so Well well

Yes sir When I went into school and found her sitting there I was
so surprised I didnt know what to do She knew me too and said good
morning and was I all right again and was my dress really as bad as it
looked to be I told her that Georgianna thought she could fix it and
if she couldnt her sister could She said that was nice and then
twas time for school to begin

Did she say anything about me inquired Captain Cy when they were
seated at the dinner table

Oh yes I forgot She must have found out who you are cause she said
she was surprised that a man who had made his money out of hides should
have been so careless about the creatures that wore em

Humph Howd she get along with the young ones in school

It appeared that she had gotten along very well with them Some of the
bigger boys in the back seats cherishing pleasant memories of the fun
they had under Miss Seaburys easygoing rule attempted to repeat their
performances of the previous term But the very first spitball which
spattered upon the blackboard proved a disastrous missile for its
thrower

She made him clean the board proclaimed Bosn bigeyed and
awestruck and then he had to stand in the corner He was Bennie
Edwards and hes most thirteen Miss Seabury they said couldnt do
anything with him but teacher said Go as quiet as could be and just
looked at him and he went And hes most as tall as she is He did look
so silly

The Edwards youth was not the only one who was made to look silly
by little Miss Dawes during the first days of her stay in Bayport She
dealt with the unruly members of her classes as bravely as she had
faced the Cahoon cow and the results were just as satisfactory She
was strict but she was impartial and Alicia Atkins found to her great
surprise that the daughter of a congressman was expected to study as
faithfully and behave herself as well as freckledfaced Noah Hamlin
whose father peddled fish and whose everyday costume was a checkered
jumper and patched overalls

The school committee that is the majority of it was delighted with
the new teacher Lemuel Myrick boasted loudly of his good judgment
in voting for her But Tad Simpson and Darius Ellis and others of the
Atkins following still scoffed and hinted at trouble in the future

A new broom sweeps fine quoted Mr Simpson Shes doin all
right now maybe Anyway the young ones are behavin themselves but
disCIPline aint the whole thing Heman told me that the teacher he
wanted could talk French language and play music and all kinds
of accomplishments Phoebenot findin any fault with her you
understanddont know no more about music than a hen my wife says she
dont even sing in church loud enough for anybody to hear her And as
for French why everybody knows she uses the commonest sort of United
States just as easy to understand as what Im sayin now

Miss Dawes boarded at the perfect boarding house There opinion was
divided concerning her Bailey and Mr Tidditt liked her but the
feminine boarders were not so favorably impressed

I think shes altogether too pert about what dont concern her
commented Angeline Phinney Sarah Emma Simpson dropped in tother
day to dinner and we church folks got to talkin about the ministers
preachin such advanced sermons And Sarah Emma told how shed heard
he said hed known some real moral Universalists in his time or some
such unreligious foolishness And I said I wondered he didnt get a new
tail coat the one he preached in Sundays was old as the hills and so
outgrown it wouldnt scurcely button acrost him A man bein paid
nine hundred a year I says ought to dress decent anyhow And that
Phoebe Dawes speaks up without bein asked and says for her part shed
ruther hear a broad man in a narrer coat than tother way about Twas a
regular slap in the face for me and Sarah Emma and I aint got over it
yet

Captain Cy heard the gossip concerning the new teacher and it rather
pleased him She appeared to be independent and he liked independence
He met her once or twice on the street but she merely bowed and passed
on Once he tried to thank her again for her part in the cow episode
but she would not listen to him

Bosn was making good progress with her studies She was naturally a
bright childnot the marvel the captain and the Board of Strategy
considered her but quick to learn She was not a saint however and
occasionally misbehaved in school and was punished for it One afternoon
she did not return at her usual hour Captain Cy was waiting at the gate
when Asaph Tidditt happened along Bailey too was with him

Waitin for Bosn was you asked the town clerk Well youll have
to wait quite a spell I callate Shes been kept after school

Yes and shes got to write fifty lines of copy added Bailey

Captain Cy was highly indignant

Get out he cried She aint neither

Yes she has too One of the Salters young ones told me I knew youd
be mad though I spose folks that didnt know hers wells we do would
say shes no different from other children

This was close to heresy according to the captains opinion

She aint he cried Id like to know why not If she aint twice as
smart as the run of young ones round here thenHumph And shes
kept after school Well now I wont have it Theres enough time for
studyin without wearin out her brains after hours Oh I guess youre
mistaken

No we aint I tell you Whit if I was you Id make a fuss about
this Shes a smart child Bosn is I never see a smarter And she
aint any too strong

Thats so she aint The idea that Emilys health was delicate had
become a fixed fact in the minds of the captain and the Board It made
a good excuse for the systematic process of spoiling the girl which
the indulgent three were doing their best to carry on

I wouldnt let her be kept Cy urged Bailey Why dont you go right
off and see Phoebe and settle this thing Youve got a right to talk to
her She wouldnt be teacher if it wasnt for you

Asaph added his arguments to those of Mr Bangs Captain Cy carried
away by his firm belief that Bosn was a paragon of all that was
brilliant and good finally yielded

All right he exclaimed Come on That poor little thing shant be
put upon by nobody

The trio marched majestically down the hill As they neared the
schoolhouse Baileys courage began to fail Miss Dawes was a boarder
at his house and he feared consequences should Keturah learn of his
interference

II guess you dont need me he stammered The three of us ll scare
that teacher woman most to death And shes so little and meek you
know If I should lose my temper and rare up I might say somethin that
would hurt her feelins Ill set on the fence and wait for you and Ase
Whit

Mr Tidditts scornful comments concerning white feathers and
backsliders had no effect Mr Bangs perched himself on the fence

Give it to her fellers he called after them

Talk Dutch to her Let her know that theres one child she cant
abuse

At the foot of the steps Asaph paused

Say Cy he whispered dont you think I better not go in It aint
really my business you know andandWell Im on the slectmen and
she might be frightened if she see me pouncin down on her Taint as
if I was just a common man Ill go and set along of Bailey and you go
in and talk quiet to her Shed feel so sort of ashamed if there was
anyone else to hear the rakin overhey

Now see here Ase expostulated the captain I dont like to do this
all by myself Besides twas you chaps put me up to it You aint goin
to pull out of the race and leave me to go over the course alone are
you Come on what are you afraid of

His companion hotly denied that he was afraid of anything He had
all sorts of arguments to back his decision At last Captain Cy lost
patience

Well BE a skulk if you want to he declared Ive set out to see
this thing through and Im goin to do it Only he muttered as he
entered the downstairs vestibule I wish I didnt feel quite so much as
if I was stealin hens eggs

Miss Dawes herself opened the door in response to his knock

Oh its you Capn Whittaker she said Come in please

Captain Cy entered the schoolroom It was empty save for the teacher
and himself and one little girl who seated at a desk was writing
busily She looked up and blushed a vivid red The little girl was
Bosn

Sit down Capn said Miss Phoebe indicating the visitors chair
What was it you wanted to see me about

The captain accepted the invitation to be seated but he did not
immediately reply to Miss Dawess question He dropped his hat on the
floor crossed his legs uncrossed them and then observed that it was
pretty summery weather for so late in the fall The teacher admitted the
truth of his assertion and waited for him to continue

II spose schools pretty full now that cranbryin s over said
Captain Cy

Yes pretty full

Gettin along first rate with the scholars I hear

Yes

This was a most unpromising beginning really no beginning at all The
captain cleared his throat set his teeth and without looking at his
companion dove headlong into the business which had brought him there

Miss Dawes he said II spose you know that BosnI mean Emily
thereis livin at my house and that Im taking care of her forfor
the present

The lady smiled

Yes she said I gathered as much from what you said when we first
met

She herself had said one or two things on that occasion Captain Cy
remembered them distinctly

Yes yes he said hastily Well my doins that time wasnt exactly
the best sample of the care I will say Want even a fair sample
maybe I try to do my best with the child long as she stays with me
anderanderIm pretty particular about her health

Im glad to hear it

Yes Now Miss Phoebe I appreciate what you did for Bosn and me that
Sunday and Im thankful for it Ive tried to thank

I know Please dont say any more about it I imagine there is
something else you want to say isnt there

Why yes there is II heard that Emmie had been kept after school I
didnt believe it of course but I thought Id run up and see what

He hesitated The teacher finished the sentence for him

To see if it was true she said It is I told her to stay and write
fifty lines

You did Well now thats what I wanted to speak to you about Course
I aint interferin in your affairs you know but I just wanted to
explain about BosnEmmie I mean She aint a common child shes got
too much head for the rest of her If youd lived with her same as I
have youd appreciate it Her healths delicate

Is it She seems strong enough to me I havent noticed any symptoms

Course not else you wouldnt have kept her in But _I_ know and I
think its my duty to tell you Never mind if she cant do quite so
much writin Id rather she wouldnt she might bust a blood vessel
or somethin Such things HAVE happened to extry smart young ones You
just let her trot along home with me now and

Capn Whittaker Miss Dawes had risen to her feet with a determined
expression on her face

Yes maam said the captain rising also

Capn Whittaker repeated the teacher Im very glad that you called
Ive been rather expecting you might because of certain things I have
heard

You heard What was it you heardif you dont mind my askin

No I dont because I think we must have an understanding about Emily
I have heard that you allow her to do as she pleases at home in other
words that you are spoiling her and

SPOILIN her _I_ spoilin her Who told you such an unlikely yarn as
that I aint the kind to spoil anybody Why Im so strict that Im
ashamed of myself sometimes

He honestly believed he was Miss Phoebe calmly continued

Of course what you do at home is none of my business I shouldnt
mention it anyhow if you hadnt called because I pay very little
attention to town talk having lived in this county all my life and
knowing what gossip amounts to I like Emily shes a pretty good little
girl and well behaved as children go But this you must understand She
cant be spoiled here She whispered this afternoon twice She has been
warned often and knows the rule I kept her after school because she
broke that rule and if she breaks it again she will be punished again
I kept the Edwards boy two hours yesterday and

Edwards boy Do you mean to compare thatthat young rip of a Ben
Edwards with a girl like Bosn I never heard

Im not comparing anybody Im trying to be fair to every scholar in
this room And so long as Emily behaves herself she shall be
treated accordingly When she doesnt she shall be punished You must
understand that

But Ben Edwards Why hes a woodenhead same as his dad was a fore
him And Emmies the smartest scholar in this town

Oh no she isnt Shes a good scholar but there are others just as
good and even quicker to learn

This was piling one insult upon another Other children as brilliant as
Bosn Captain Cy was bursting with righteous indignation

Well he exclaimed Well for a teacher that weve called to

And thats another thing broke in Miss Dawes quickly Ive been told
that you Capn Whittaker are the one directly responsible for my
being chosen for this place I dont say that you are presuming on that
but

I aint I never thought of such a thing

But if you are you mustnt thats all I didnt ask for the position
and now that Ive got it I shall try to fill it without regard to one
person more than another Emily stays here until her lines are written
I dont think we need to say any more Good day

She opened the door Captain Cy picked up his hat swallowed hard and
stepped across the threshold Then Miss Phoebe added one more remark

Capn she said when you were in command of a ship did you allow
outsiders to tell you how to treat the sailors

The captain opened his mouth to reply He wanted to reply very much but
somehow he couldnt find a satisfying answer to that question

Maam he said all I can say is that if youd been in South America
same as I have and seen the way them halfbreed young ones act
youd

The teacher smiled in spite of an apparent effort not to

Perhaps so she said but this is Massachusetts Andwell Emily
isnt a halfbreed

Captain Cy strode through the vestibule Just before the door closed
behind him he heard a stifled sob from poor Bosn

The Board of Strategy was waiting at the end of the yard Its members
were filled with curiosity

Did you give it to her good demanded Asaph Did you let her
understand we wouldnt put up with such cruelizin

Wheres Bosn asked Mr Bangs

Their friends answers were brief and tantalizingly incomplete He
walked homeward at a gait which caused plump little Bailey to puff
in his efforts to keep up and he would say almost nothing about the
interview in the schoolroom

Well said Mr Tidditt when they reached the Whittaker gate I guess
she knows her place now hey Cy I callate shell be careful who she
keeps after school from now on

Didnt use no profane language did you Cy asked Bailey I hope
not cause she might have you took up just out of spite Did she ask
your pardon for her actions

No roared the captain savagely Then banging the gate behind him he
strode up the yard and into the house

Bosn came home a half hour later Captain Cy was alone in the sitting
room seated in his favorite rocker and moodily staring at nothing in
particular The girl gazed at him for a moment and then climbed into his
lap

I wrote my fifty lines Uncle Cyrus she said Teacher said Id done
them very nicely too

The captain grunted

Uncle Cy whispered Bosn putting her arms around his neck Im
awful sorry I was so bad

Bad Whoyou You couldnt be bad if you wanted to Dont talk that
way or Ill say somethin I hadnt ought to

Yes I could be bad too I was bad I whispered

Whispered What of it That aint nothin When I was a young one in
school I used to whis    Hum Well anyhow dont you think any
more about it Taint worth while

They rocked quietly for a time Then Bosn said

Uncle Cyrus dont you like teacher

Hey LIKE her Well if that aint a question Yes I like her about as
well as Lonesome likes Eben Salters dog

Im sorry I like her ever so much

You DO Go long After the way she treated you poor little thing

She didnt treat me any worse than she does the other girls and boys
when theyre naughty And I did know the rule about whispering

Well thats different Comparin you with that Bennie Edwardsthe
idea And then makin you cry

She didnt make me cry

Did too I heard you

The child looked up at him and then hid her face in his waistcoat

I wasnt crying about her she whispered It was you

ME The captain gasped Good land he muttered Its just as I
expected Shes studied too hard and its touchin her brain

No sir it isnt It isnt truly I did cry about you because I didnt
like to hear you talk so And I was so sorry to have you come there

You WAS

Yes sir Other childrens folks dont come when theyre bad And I
kept feeling so sort of ashamed of you

Ashamed of ME

Bosn nodded vigorously

Yes sir Everything teacher said sounded so right and what you said
didnt And I like to have you always right

Do hey Hum Captain Cy didnt speak again for some few minutes but
he held the little girl very tight in his arms At length he drew a long
breath

By the big dipper Bosn he exclaimed Youre a wonder you are
I wouldnt be surprised if you grew up to be a mind reader like that
feller in the show we went to at the townhall a spell ago To tell you
the honest Lords truth Ive been ashamed of myself ever since I come
out of that schoolhouse door When that teacher woman sprung that on me
about my fomast hands aboard ship I was set back about forty fathom I
never wanted to answer anybody so bad in MY life and I couldnt cause
there wasnt anything to say I callate Ive made a fool of myself

Bosn nodded again

We wont do so any more will we she said

You bet we wont _I_ wont anyhow You havent done anything

And youll like teacher

The captain stamped his foot

No SIR he declared She may be all right in her wayI spose she
is but its too Massachusettsy a way for me No sir I dont like her
and I WONT like her No siree never Sheshe aint my kind of a
woman he added stubbornly Thats whats the matter She aint my
kind of a woman



CHAPTER IX

POLITICS AND BIRTHDAYS


Town meeting was called for the twentyfirst of November

With the summer boarders gone the cranberry picking finished state
election over school begun and under way and real winter not yet upon
us Bayport in the late fall distinctly needs something to enliven
it The Shakespeare Reading Society and the sewing circle continue of
course to interest the women folks there is the usual every evening
gathering at Simmonss and the young people are looking forward to the
Grand Ball on Thanksgiving eve But for the men on week days
there is little to do except to putter about the house banking
its foundations with dry seaweed as a precaution against searching
notheasters whitewashing the barns and outbuildings or fixing things
in the vegetable cellar where the sticks of smoked herring hang in rows
above the barrels of cabbages potatoes and turnips The fish weirs
most of them are taken up lest the ice which will be driven into the
bay later on tear the nets to pieces Even the hens grow lazy and
lay less frequently Therefore away back in the airly days some
farsighted board of selectmen arranged that town meeting should be
held during this lackadaisical season A town meetingand particularly
a Bayport town meeting where everything from personal affairs to
religion is likely to be discussedcan stir up excitement when nothing
else can

This year there were several questions to be talked over and settled at
town meeting Two selectmen whose terms expired were candidates for
reelection Lem Myrick had resigned from the school committee not
waiting until spring as he had announced that he should do Then
there was the usual sentiment in favor of better roads and the usual
opposition to it Also there was the everpresent hope of the government
appropriation for harbor improvement

Mr Tidditt was one of the selectmen whose terms expired In his dual
capacity as selectman and town clerk Asaph felt himself to be a very
important personage To elect some one else in his place would be he
was certain a calamity which would stagger the township Therefore
he was a busy man and made many calls upon his fellow citizens not to
influence their voteshe was careful to explain thatbut just as
he said to see how they was gettin along and because he
thought considerble of em and took a real personal interest you
understand in their affairs

To Captain Cy he came naturally for encouragement and help beingas
was his habit at such timesin a state of gloom and hopeless despair

No use Whit he groaned Taint no use at all Im licked Im
gettin old and they dont want me no more I guess Id better get right
up afore the votin begins and tell em my health aint strong enough to
be town clerk no longer Its better to do that than to be licked Dont
you think so

Sure thing replied his friend with sarcasm If I was you Id be
toted in on a bed so they can see youre all ready for the funeral
Might have the doctor walkin ahead wipin his eyes and the joyful
undertaker trottin along astern Whats the particular disease thats
got you by the collar just nowfacial paralysis

No What made you think of that

Oh nothin Only I heard you stopped in at ten houses up to the west
end of the town yesterday and talked three quarters of an hour steady
at everyone That would fit me for the scrap heap inside of a week
and youve been goin it ever since September nearly What does ail
youanything

Why no nothin special that way Only there dont seem to be any
enthusiasm for me somehow I just hint at my bein a candidate and
folks say Yes indeed Looks like rain dont it and thats about
all

Well that hadnt ought to surprise you If anybody came to me and
says The suns goin to rise tomorrer mornin I shouldnt dance
on my hat and crow hallelujahs Enthusiasm Why Ase youve been a
candidate every two years since Noah got the ark off the ways or along
there And there aint been any opposition to you yet except that time
when Uncle Bial Stickney woke up in the wrong place and hollered No
out of principle thinkin he was to home with his wife If I was you
Id go and take a nap Youll read the minutes at selectmens meetings
for another fifty year more or less take my word for it As for the
school committee thats different I aint made up my mind about that

There had been much discussion concerning the school committee Who
should be chosen to replace Mr Myrick on the board was the gravest
question to come before the meeting Many names had been proposed at
Simmonss and elsewhere but some of those named had refused to run and
others had not after further consideration seemed the proper persons
for the office In the absence of Mr Atkins Tad Simpson was our leader
in the political arena But Tad so far had been mute

Wait a while he said Theres some weeks afore town meetin day
This is a serious business We cant have no moreI mean no unsuitable
man to fill such an important place as that The welfare of our
posterity he added and we all recognized the quotation depends upon
the choice thats to be made

A choice was made however on the very next day but one after this
declaration A candidate announced himself Asaph and Bailey hurried
to the Cy Whittaker place with the news Captain Cy was in the woodshed
building a doll house for Bosn Just for my own amusement he hastily
explained Somethin for her to take along when she goes out West to
Betsy

Mr Tidditt was all smiles

What do you think Cy he cried The new school committee mans as
good as elected Lonzo Snows goin to take it

The captain laid down his plane

Lonzo Snow he repeated You dont say Humph Well well

Yes sir exclaimed Bailey Hes come forward and says its his duty
to do so He

Humph His duty hey I wonder who pointed it out to him

Well I dont know But even Tad Simpsons glad he says that he knows
Heman will be pleased with THAT kind of a candidate and so he wont have
to do any more huntin He thinks Lonzos comin out by himself this
way is a kind of special Providence

Yes yes I shouldnt wonder Did you ever notice how dead sure Tad and
his kind are that Providence is workin with em Seems to me twould
be more satisfactory if we could get a sight of the other partners
signature to the deed

Whats the matter with you demanded Asaph You aint findin fault
with Lonzo are you Aint he a good man

Good Sure thing hes good Nobody can say he isnt and tell the
truth

No one could truthfully speak ill of Alonzo Snow that was a fact
He lived at the lower end of the village was well to do a leading
cranberry grower and very prominent in the church A mild easygoing
person was Mr Snow with an almost too keen fear of doing the wrong
thing and therefore prone to be guided by the opinion of others He was
distinctly not a politician

Then what ails you asked Asaph hotly

Why nothin maybe Only Im always suspicious when Tad pats
Providence on the back I generally figure that I can see through a
doughnut when theres a light behind the hole Who is Lonzos best
friend in this town Who does he chum with most of anybody

Why Darius Ellis I guess You know it

Umhum And Darius is on the committeewhy

Well I spose cause Heman Atkins thought hed be a good feller to
have there But

Yes and Lonzos pew in church is right under the Atkins memorial
window The light from it makes a kind of halo round his bald head every
Sunday

Well what of it Heman nor nobody else could buy Lonzo Snow

Buy him Indeed they couldnt But there are some things you get
without buyinthe measles for instance And the one thats catchin
em dont know hes in danger till the speckles break out Fellers this
committee voted in Phoebe Dawes by just two votes to one and one of
the two was Lem Myrick Darius was against her Now with Tad and his
Providence puttin in Lonzo Snow and Heman Atkins settin behind
the screen workin his Normal School music box sos they can hear the
tunewell Phoebe MAY stay this term out but how about next

Hey Why I dont know Anyhow youre down on Phoebe as a thousand of
brick I dont see why you worry about HER After the way she treated
poor Bosn and all

Captain Cy stirred uneasily and kicked a chip across the floor

Well he said well II dont knows thatsThat is rights right
and wrongs wrong Ive seen bullfights down yonder jerking his thumb
over his shoulder in the vague direction of Buenos Ayres and every
time my sympathys been with the bull Not that I loved the critter for
his own sake but because all Greaserdom was out to down him From what
I hear this Phoebe Dawesfor all her pesky downEast stubbornnessis
teachin pretty well and anyhow shes one little woman against Tad
Simpson and Heman Atkins andand Tads special brand of Providence She
deserves a fair shake and by the big dipper shes goin to have it
Look here you two how would I look on the school committee

You repeated the pair in concert YOU

Yes me I aint a Solomon for wisdom but I callate Id be as near
the top of the barrel as Darius Ellis and only one or two layers under
Eben Salters or Lonzo Snow Im a candidatesee

Butbut Whit gasped the town clerk are you popular enough Could
you get elected

I dont know but I can find out You and Bailey ll vote for me wont
you

Course we will but

All right Theres two votes A hundred and odd morell put me in
Here goes for politics and popularity I may be president yet you cant
tell And say this town meetin wont be DULL whichever way the cat
jumps

This last was a safe prophecy All dullness disappeared from Bayport the
moment it became known that Captain Cyrus Whittaker was out for the
school committee The captain began his electioneering at once That
very afternoon he called upon three peopleEben Salters Josiah Dimick
and Lemuel Myrick

Captain Salters was chairman of selectmen as well as chairman of the
committee He was a hardheaded old salt who had made money in the
Australian packet service He had common sense independence and
considerable influence in the town Next to Congressman Atkins he was
perhaps our leading citizen And more than all he was not afraid
when he thought it necessary to oppose the great Heman

Well he said reflectively after listening to Captain Cys brief
statement of his candidacy I callate Ill stand in with you Cy I
aint got anything against Lonzo butbutwell consarn it maybe
thats the trouble Maybe hes so darned good it makes me jealous
Anyhow Ill do what I can for you

Joe Dimick laughed aloud He was an iconoclast seldom went to church
and was entirely lacking in reverence Also he really liked the captain

Ho ho he crowed Whit do you realize that youre underminin this
towns constitution Oh sartin Im with you if its only to see the
fur fly I do love a scrap

With Lem Myrick Captain Cys policy was different He gently reminded
that gentleman of the painting contract intimated that other favors
might be forthcoming and then as a clincher spoke of Tad Simpsons
comment when Mr Myrick voted for Phoebe Dawes

Of course he added if you think Tads got a right to boss all hands
and the cook why I aint complainin Only if _I_ was a painter doin
a good highclass trade and a onehoss barber tried to dictate to me
I shouldnt bow down and tell him to kick easy as he could Seems to me
Id kick first But IM no boss I mustnt influence you

Lemuel was indignant

No barber runs me he declared You stand up for me when that
townhall paintins to be done and Ill work hard for you now Capn
Whittaker Lonzo Snows an elder and all that but I cant help it
Anyway his place was all fixed up a year ago and I didnt get the job
A feller has to look after himself these days

With these division commanders to lead their forces into the enemys
country and with Asaph and Bailey doing what they could to help Captain
Cys campaign soon became worthy of respectful consideration For a
while Tad Simpson scoffed at the opposition then he began to work
openly for Mr Snow Later he marshaled his trusted officers around the
pool table in the back room of the barber shop and confided to them that
it was anybodys fight and that he was worried

Its past bein a joke he said Its mighty serious Weve got to
hustle we have Heman trusted me in this job and if I fall down it ll
be bad for me and for you fellers too I wish he was home to run things
himself but hes got business down South theresome property he owns
or somethinand says he cant leave But we must win By mighty weve
GOT to So get every vote you can Never mind how just get em thats
all

Captain Cy was thoroughly enjoying himself The struggle suited him to
perfection He was young in spite of his fiftyfive years and this
tussle against odds reminding him of other tussles during his first
seasons in business aroused his energies and as he expressed it
stirred up his vitals and made him hop round like a dose of pain
killer

He did not however forget Bosn He and she had their walks and their
pleasant evenings together in spite of politics He took the child into
his confidence and told her of the daily gain or loss in votes as
if she were his own age She understood a little of all this and tried
hard to understand the rest preaching between times to Georgianna how
the bad men were trying to beat Uncle Cyrus because he was gooder than
they but they couldnt cause everybody loved him so Georgianna had
some doubts but she kept them to herself

Among the things in Bosns box was a long envelope sealed with wax
and with a lawyers name printed in one corner The captain opened it
at Emilys suggestion and was astonished to find that the inclosure was
a will dated some years back in which Mrs Mary Thomas the childs
mother left to her daughter all her personal property and also the land
in Orham Massachusetts which had been willed to her by her own mother
There was a note with the will in which Mrs Thomas stated that no one
save herself had known of this land not even her husband She had not
told him because she feared that like everything else it would be
sold and the money wasted in dissipation He suspected something of the
sort she added but he did not find out the secret although he
She had evidently scratched out what followed but Captain Cy mentally
filled in the blank with details of abuse and cruelty If anything
happens to me concluded the widow I want the land sold and the money
used for Emilys maintenance as long as it lasts

The captain went over to Orham and looked up the land It was a strip
along the shore almost worthless and unsalable at present The taxes
had been regularly paid each year by Mary Thomas who had sent money
orders from Concord The selfdenial represented by these orders was not
a little

Never mind Bosn said Captain Cy when he returned from the Orham
trip Your ancestral estates aint much now but a sandflea menagerie
However if this section ever does get to be the big summer resort folks
are prophesying for it you may sell out to some millionaire and you and
mell go to Europe Meantime well try to keep afloat if the Harniss
Bank dont spring a leak

On the day following this conversation he took a flying trip to Ostable
the county seat returning the same evening and saying nothing to
anyone about his reasons for going nor what he had done while there

Bosns birthday was the eighteenth of November The captain in spite
of the warmth of his struggle for committee honors determined to have a
small celebration on the afternoon and evening of that day It was to be
a surprise for Emily and after school was over some of her particular
friends among the scholars were to come in there was to be a cake with
eight candles on it and a supper at which ice creamlemon and vanilla
prepared by Mrs Cahoonwas to be the principal feature Also there
would be games and all sorts of fun

Captain Cy was tremendously interested in the party He spent hours with
Georgianna and the Board of Strategy preparing the list of guests
His cunning in ascertaining from the unsuspecting child who among her
schoolmates she would like to invite was deep and guileful

Now Bosn he would say suppose you was goin to clear out and
leave this town for a spell who

But Uncle Cyrus Bosns eyes grew frightened and moist in a moment
I aint going am I I dont want to go

No no Course you aint gointhat is not for a long while anyhow
with a sidelong look at the members of the Board then present But
just suppose you and me was startin on that Europe trip Whod you want
to say goodby to most of all

Each name given by the child was surreptitiously penciled by Bailey on
a scrap of paper The list was a long one and when the great afternoon
came the Whittaker house was crowded

The supper was a brilliant success So was the cake brought in with
candles ablaze by the grinning Georgianna Beside the children there
were some older people present Bailey and Asaph of course and the
regulars from the perfect boarding house who had been invited because
it was fairly certain that Mr Bangs wouldnt be allowed to attend
if his wife did not Miss Dawes had also been asked at Bosns
wellunderstood partiality but she had declined

Toward the end of the meal when the hilarity at the long table was at
its height an unexpected guest made his appearance There was a knock
at the diningroom door and Georgianna opening it was petrified to
behold standing upon the step no less a personage than the Honorable
Heman Atkins supposed by most of us to be then somewhere in that wide
stretch of territory vaguely termed the South

Good evening all said the illustrious one removing his silk hat
and stepping into the room What a charming scene I trust I do not
intrude

Georgianna was still speechless in which unwonted condition she was not
alone Messrs Bangs and Tidditt being also stricken dumb But Captain
Cy rose to the occasion grandly

Intrude he repeated Not a mite of it Mighty glad to see you
Heman Here give us your hat Pull up to the table When did you get
back Thought you was in the orange groves somewheres

Ahem I was Yes I was in that neighborhood But it is hard to stay
away from dear old Bayport Home ties you know home ties I came down
on the morning train but I stopped over at Harniss on business and
drove across Ahem Yes The housekeeper informed me that my daughter
was here and seeing the lights and hearing the laughter I couldnt
resist making this impromptu call Im sure as an old friend and
neighbor Cyrus you will pardon me Alicia darling come and kiss
papa

Darling Alicia accepted the invitation with a rustle of silk and an
ecstatic squeal of delight During this affecting scene Asaph whispered
to Bailey that he callated Heman had had a hurryup distress signal
from Simpson to which sage observation Mr Bangs replied with a
vigorous nod showing that Captain Cys example had had its effect
in that they no longer stood in such awe of their representative at
Washington

However true Asaphs calculation might have been Mr Atkins made no
mention of politics He was urbanity itself He drew up to the table
partook of the ice cream and cake and greeted his friends and neighbors
with charming benignity

Want it sweet of him to come whispered Miss Phinney to Keturah
And him so nice and everyday and sociable And when Capn Whittakers
runnin against his friend as you might say

Keturah replied with a dubious shake of the head

I think Captain Cyrus is goin to get into trouble she said Ive
preached to Bailey more n a little about keepin clear but he wont

Games in tother room now ordered Captain Cy But Mr Atkins held up
his hand

Pardon me just a moment Cyrus if you please he said I feel that
on this happy occasion it is my duty and pleasure to propose a toast
He held his lemonade glass aloft Permit me he proclaimed to wish
many happy birthdays and long life to MissI beg pardon Cyrus but
what is your little friends name

Emily Richards Thayer replied the captain carried away by enthusiasm
and off his guard for once

To Em began Heman Then he paused and for the first time in his
public life seemed at a loss for words What he asked and his hand
shook I fear I didnt catch the name

No wonder laughed Mr Tidditt Cys so crazy tonight hed forget
his own name Know what you said Cy You said she was Emily Richards
THAYER Haw haw She aint a Thayer Heman her last names Thomas
Shes Emily Richards Thayers granddaughter though Her granddad was
John Thayer over to Orham Good land I forgot Well what of it Cy
Twould have to be known some time

Everyone looked at Captain Cy then No one observed Mr Atkins for the
moment When they did turn their gaze upon the great man he had sunk
back in his chair the glass of lemonade was upset upon the cloth before
him and he with a very white face was staring at Emily Richards
Thomas

Whats the matter Heman asked the captain anxiously Aint sick
are you

The congressman started

Oh no he said hurriedly Oh no but Im afraid Ive soiled your
cloth It was awkward of me II really I apologizeI

He wiped his face with his handkerchief Captain Cy laughed

Oh never mind the tablecloth he said I callate its too soiled
already to be hurt by a bath even a lemon one Well youve all heard
the toast Full glasses now Heres TO you Bosn Drink hearty all
hands and give the ship a good name

If the heartiness with which they drank is a criterion the good name
of the ship was established Then the assembly adjourned to the sitting
room andyes even the front parlor Not since the days when that
sacred apartment had been desecrated by the irreverent city boarders
during the Howes regime had its walls echoed to such whoops and shouts
of laughter The children played Post Office and Copenhagen and
Clap in Clap out while the grown folks looked on

Aint they havin a fine time Cap gushed Miss Phinney Dont it
make you wish you was young again

Angie replied Captain Cy solemnly dont tempt me dont If they
keep on playin that Copenhagen and you stand right alongside of me
theres no tellin what ll happen

Angeline declared that he was turrible but she faced the threatened
danger nevertheless and bravely remained where she was

Mr Atkins went home early in the evening taking Alicia with him He
explained that his long railroad journey hadersomewhat fatigued
him and though he hated to leave such aerdelightful gathering
he really felt that under the circumstances his departure would be
forgiven Captain Cy opened the door for him and stood watching as
holding his daughter by the hand he marched majestically down the path

Hum mused the captain aloud I guess he has been travelin nights
Thought he ought to be here quick I shouldnt wonder He does look
tired thats a fact and kind of pale seemed to me

Well there now exclaimed Mrs Tripp who was looking over his
shoulder Did you see that

No what was it

Why when he went to open his gate one of them arbor vity bushes he
set out this spring knocked his hat off And he never seemed to notice
but went right on If Licia hadnt picked it up that nice new hat
would have been layin there yet Thats the most undignified thing ever
I see Heman Atkins do He MUST be tired out poor man



CHAPTER X

A LETTER AND A VISITOR


Whit asked Asaph next day want you surprised to see Heman last
night

Captain Cy nodded He was once more busy with the doll house the
construction of which had progressed slowly of late owing to the
demands which the party and politics made upon its builders time

Yup he said I sartinly was Pretty good sign I shouldnt wonder
Looks as if friend Tad had found the tide settin too strong against him
and had whistled for a tug All right the more scared the other side
get the better for us

But what in the world made Heman come over and have supper He never
so much as stepped foot in the house afore did he Thats the biggest
conundrum of all

Well I guess Ive got the answer Strikes me that Hemans sociableness
is the best sign yet Hemans a slick article and when he sees theres
danger of losin the frostin on the cake he takes care to scrape the
burnt part off the bottom I may be school committeeman after town
meetin Hell move all creation to stop me of coursein his quiet
roundthecorner waybut if I do win out he wants to be in a position
to take me one side and tell me that hes glad of it he felt all along
I was the right feller for the job and if theres anything he can do to
make things easier for me just call on him Thats the way I size it up
anyhow

Cy I never see anybody like you Youre dead set against Heman and
have been right along And hes never done anything to you furs I see
Hes given a lot to the town and hes always been the most lookedupto
man weve got Joe Dimick and two or three more chronic growls have been
the only ones to sling out hints against him till you come Course
Im working for you tooth and nail and I will say that you seem to be
gettin the votes some way or other But if Heman SHOULD step right out
and say Feller citizens Im behind Tad Simpson in this fight and as
a favor to me and cause I think its right and best I want Lonzo Snow
electedwell _I_ dont believe youd have moren one jack and a ten
spot to count for game

Probably not Ase I presume likely not But you take a day off some
time and see if you can remember that Heman EVER stepped right out and
said things Blame it thats just it As for WHY he riles me up and
makes me stubborn as a balky mule I dont know exactly All Im sure
is that he does Maybe its cause I dont like the way he wears his
whiskers Maybe its because hes so toplofty and condescendin A
feller can whistle to me and say Come on Bill and Ill trot at his
heels all day But when he pats me on the head and says There there
nice doggie Go under the bed and lay down my back bristles up and I
commence to growl right off Theres considerble Whittaker in me as
Ive told you before

The town clerk pondered over this rather unsatisfactory line of
reasoning for some minutes His companion fitted a wooden chimney on the
doll house found it a trifle out of plumb and proceeded to whittle
a shaving off the lower edge Then Asaph sighed as one who gives up a
perplexing riddle put his hand in his pocket and produced a bundle of
papers

I made out a list of fellers down to the eastard that Im goin to
see this afternoon he said Some of em I guess ll vote for you
but most of em are pretty sartin for Lonzo However IWhere is
that list I had it somewheres Andwell I swan I come pretty near
forgettin it myself Im most as bad as Bailey

From the bundle of papers he produced a crumpled envelope

That Bailey he observed must be in love I callate though I dont
know who with Ketury I spose cordin to law and order butWell
anyhow hes gettin more absentminded all the time Heres a letter
for you Cy that he got at the postoffice a week ago Monday Twas the
night of the church sociable and he had on his Sunday cutaway and
he aint worn it sence till the party yesterday When he took off the
coat goin to bed the letter fell out of it I guess he was ashamed to
fetch it round himself so he asked me to do it Better late than never
hey Heres that list at last

He produced the list and handed it to the captain for inspection The
latter looked it over made a few comments and suggestions and told his
friend to heave ahead and land as many of the listed as possible This
Mr Tidditt promised to do and replacing the papers in his pocket
started for the gate

Oh Say Ase

The town clerk his hand on the gate latch turned

Well what is it he asked Dont keep me no longern you can help I
got work to do I have

All right I wont stop you Only fallin in love is kind of epidemic
down at the boardin house I guess Who is it thats got you in
towMatildy

What are you talkin about Didnt I tell you to quit namin me with
Matildy Tripp I like a joke as well as most folks but when its wore
into the ground I

Sho sho Dont get mad Its your own fault You said that
absentmindedness was a love symptom so I just got to thinkin thats
all That letter that Bailey forgotyou havent given it to me yet

Asaph turned red and hastily snatched the papers from his pocket He
strode back to the door of the woodshed handed his friend the crumpled
envelope and stalked off without another word The captain chuckled
laid the letter on the bench beside him and went on with his work It
was perhaps ten minutes later when happening to glance at the postmark
on the envelope he saw that it was Concord N H

Asaphs votegathering trip to the eastard made a full day for him
He returned to the perfect boarding house just at supper time During
the meal he realized that Mr Bangs seemed to be trying to attract his
attention Whenever he glanced in that gentlemans direction his glance
was met by winks and mystifying shakes of the head Losing patience at
last he demanded to know what was the matter

Want to say somethin to me do you he inquired briskly If you do
out with it Dont set there workin your face as if twas wound up
like a clockwork image

This remark had the effect of turning all the other faces toward
Baileys He was very much upset

No no he stammered No no I dont want you for nothin Was I
makin my face go II didnt know it Ive been washin carriages and
cleanin up the barn all day and I callate Ive overdone Im gettin
old and hard works likely to bring on shakin palsy to old folks

His wife tartly observed that if WORK was the cause of it she guessed
he was safe from palsy for quite a spell yet At any rate a marked
recovery set in and he signaled no more during the meal But when it was
over and his task as dishwiper completed he hurried out of doors and
found Mr Tidditt shivering in the November wind on the front porch

Now what is it asked Asaph sharply I know theres somethin and
Ive froze to death by sections waitin to hear it

Have you seen Cy whispered Bailey glancing fearfully over his
shoulder at the lighted windows of the house

No not sence mornin Why

Well theres somethin the matter with him Somethin serious I was
swabbin decks in the barn about eleven oclock when he come postin
in white and shaky and so nervous he couldnt stand still Looked as
if he had had a stroke almost I

Godfrey scissors You dont spose Hemans comin back has knocked out
his chances for the committee do you

No siree twant that Cys anxious to be elected and all but you
know his politics are more of a joke with him than anything else And
any rap Heman or Tad could give him would only make him fight harder
And he wouldnt talk politics at all didnt seem to give a durn about
em one way or tother No twas somethin about that letter the one
I forgot so long He wanted to know why in time I hadnt given it to him
when it fust come He was real ugly about it for him and kept pacin
up and down the barn floor and layin into me till I begun to think he
was crazy I guess he see my feelins were hurt cause just afore he
left he held out his hand and said I mustnt mind his talk hed been
knocked on his beam ends he said and want really responsible

Wouldnt he say what had knocked him

No couldnt get nothin out of him And when he quit he went off
toward home slappin his fists together and actin as if he didnt see
the road across his bows Now you know how cool and easy goin Whit
generally is I swan to man Ase he made me so sorry for him I didnt
know what to do

Aint you been up to see him sence

No Ketury was sot on havin the barn cleaned and she stood over
me with a ropes end as you might say I couldnt get away a minute
though I made up moren a dozen errands at Simmonss and the like of
that You hold on till I sneak into the entry and get my cap and well
put for there now I wont be but a jiffy Im worried

They entered the yard of the Cy Whittaker place together and approached
the side door As they stood on the steps Asaph touched his chum on the
arm and pointed to the window beside them The shade was half drawn and
beneath it they had a clear view of the interior of the sitting room
Captain Cy was in the rocker before the stove holding Bosn in his
arms The child was sound asleep her yellow braid hanging over the
captains broad shoulder He was gazing down into her face with a look
which was so full of yearning and love that it brought a choke into the
throats of the pair who saw it

They entered the dining room The captain sprang from his chair and
still holding the little girl close against his breast met them at
the sittingroom door When he saw who the visitors were he caught his
breath almost with a sob and seemed relieved

Sshh he whispered warningly Shes asleep

The members of the Board of Strategy nodded understandingly and sat
down upon the sofa Captain Cy tiptoed to the bedroom turned back the
bedclothes with one hand and laid Bosn down They saw him tuck her
carefully in and then stoop and kiss her He returned to the sitting
room and closed the door behind him

We see she was asleep afore we come in explained Asaph We see you
and her through the window

The captain looked hurriedly at the window indicated Then he stepped
over and pulled the shade down to the sill doing the same with the
curtains of the other two windows

Whats the matter inquired Bailey trying to be facetious Fraid of
Lonzos crowd spyin on us

Captain Cy did not reply He did not even sit down but remained
standing his back to the stove

Well he asked shortly Did you fellers want to see me for anything
special

Wanted to see what had struck you all to once replied Mr Tidditt
Bailey says you scared him half to death this forenoon And you look
now as if somebodys ghost had riz and hollered Boo at you For the
land sakes Whit what IS it

The captain drew his hand across his forehead

Ghost he repeated absently No I havent SEEN a ghost There
there dont mind me I aint real well today I guess He smiled
crookedly

Dont you want to hear about my votegrabbin cruise asked Tidditt
I was flatterin myself youd be tickled to hear Id done so well Why
even Marcellus Parker says he may vote for youif he makes up his mind
that way

Marcellus was a nextdoor neighbor of Alonzo Snows But Captain Cy
didnt seem to care

Hey he murmured Yes Well

WELL Is that all youve got to say Are you really sick Cy Or is
Bosn sick

No was the answer almost fierce in its utterance She isnt sick
Dont be a fool

Whats foolish about that I didnt know but she might be Theres
mumps in town and

Shes all right so shut up will you There Ase he added Im the
fool myself Dont mind my barkin I dont mean it I am about sick I
callate Be better tomorrer maybe

Whats got into you Was that letter of Baileys

Hush The captain held up his hand I thought I heard a team

Depot wagon most likely said Bailey About time for it Humph
seems to be stoppin dont it Was you expectin anybody Shall I go
and

No Set still

The pair on the sofa sat still Captain Cy stood like a statue in the
middle of the floor He squared his shoulders and jammed his clenched
fists into his pockets Steps crunched the gravel of the walk There
came a knock at the door of the dining room

Walking steadily but with a face set as the figurehead on one of his
own ships the captain went to answer the knock They heard the door
open and then a mans voice asked

Is this Capn Whittaker

Yes was the short answer

Well Cap I guess you dont know me though maybe you know some of my
family Ha ha Dont understand that hey Well you let me in and Ill
explain the joke

The captains reply was calm and deliberate

I shouldnt wonder if I understood it he said Come in Dont The
remainder of the sentence was whispered and the listeners on the sofa
could not hear it A moment later Captain Cy entered the sitting room
followed by his caller

The latter was a stranger He was a broadshouldered man of medium
height with a yellowish mustache and brown hair He was dressed in
rather shabby clothes without an overcoat and he had a soft felt hat
in his hand The most noticeable thing about him was a slight hesitancy
in his walk He was not lame he did not limp yet his left foot seemed
to halt for an instant as he brought it forward in the step They
learned afterwards that it had been hurt in a mine cavein He carried
himself with a swagger and after his entrance there was a perceptible
aroma of alcohol in the room

He stared at the Board of Strategy and the stare was returned in
full measure Bailey and Asaph were wildly curious They of course
connected the strangers arrival with the mysterious letter and the
captains perturbation of the day

But their curiosity was not to be satisfied at least not then

How are you gents hailed the newcomer cheerfully Like the looks of
me do you

Captain Cy cut off further conversation

Ase he said thisergentleman and I have got some business to
talk over I know youre good enough friends of mine not to mind if
I ask you to clear out Youll understand You WILL understand boys
wont you he added almost entreatingly

Sartin sure replied Mr Tidditt rising hurriedly Dont say another
word Whit And the mystified Bangs concurred with a Yes yes Why of
course Didnt have nothin that amounts to nothin to stay for anyhow
See you tomorrer Cy

Outside and at the gate they stopped and looked at each other

Well exclaimed Asaph If that aint the strangest thing Who was
that feller Whered he come from Did you notice how Cy acted Seemed
to be holdin himself in by main strength

Did you smell the rum on him returned Bailey On that tother chap
I mean Didnt he look like a reglar noaccount to you And say Ase
didnt he remind you of somebody youd seen somewhereskind of in a
way

They walked home in a dazed state asking unanswerable questions and
making profitless guesses But Asaphs final remark seemed to sum up the
situation

Theres trouble comin of this Bailey he declared And its trouble
for Cy Whittaker Im afraid Poor old Cy Well WELL stand by him
anyhow I dont believe hell sleep much tonight Didnt look as though
he would did he Who IS that feller

If he had seen Captain Cy at two oclock the next morning sitting
by Bosns bedside and gazing hopelessly at the child he would have
realized that if his former predictions were wiped off the slate and he
could be judged by the one concerning the captains sleepless night he
might thereafter pose as a true prophet



CHAPTER XI

A BARGAIN OFF


Mornin Georgianna said Captain Cy to his housekeeper as the latter
unlocked the back door of the Whittaker house next morning Im a
little ahead of you this time

Miss Taylor being Bayport born and bred was an early riser She lodged
with her sister in Bassetts Hollow a good half mile from the Cy
Whittaker place but she was always on hand at the latter establishment
by six each morning except Sundays Now she glanced quickly at the
clock The time was ten minutes to six

Land sakes she exclaimed I should say you was What in the world
got you up so early Aint sick are you

No replied the captain wearily I aint sick I didnt sleep very
well last night thats all

Georgianna looked sharply at him His face was haggard and his eyes had
dark circles under them

Humph she grunted No I guess you didnt Looks to me as if youd
been up all night Then she added an anxious query Taint Bosnshe
aint sick I hope

No Shes all right I say Georgianna you put on an extry plate this
mornin Got company for breakfast

The housekeeper was surprised

For breakfast she repeated Land of goodness whos comin for
breakfast I never heard of company droppin in for breakfast Thats
one meal folks generally get to home Who is it Mr Tidditt Has Ketury
turned him out door because hes too bad an example for her husband

No taint Ase Its aa friend of mine Well not exactly a friend
maybe but an acquaintance from out of town He came last evenin Hes
up in the spare bedroom

Well I never Come unexpected didnt he I wish Id known he was
comin That spare room bed aint been aired I dont know when

I guess he can stand it I callate hes slept in considerble
worseHum Yes he did come kind of sudden

Whats his name

What difference does that make I dont knows his name makes any odds
about gettin his breakfast for him

Georgianna was hurt Her easygoing employer had never used this tone
before when addressing her

Oh she sniffed Is THAT the way you feel All right I can mind my
own business thank you I only asked because its convenient sometimes
to know whether to call a person Bill Smith or Sol Jones But I dont
care if its Nebuchadnezzar I know when to keep my tongue still I
guess

She flounced over to the range Captain Cy looked ashamed of himself

Im kind of out of sorts today he said Got some headache Why his
name isisyes tis Smith come to think of itJohn Smith Funny you
should guess right want it

Humph was the ungracious answer Names dont interest me I tell
you

The captain was in the dining room when Bosn appeared

Good morning Uncle Cyrus she said Youve been waiting havent
you Am I late I didnt mean to be

No no you aint late Early if anything Breakfast aint quite ready
yet Come here and set in my lap I want to talk to you

He took her on his knee She looked up into his face

Whats the matter Uncle Cy she asked What makes you so sober

Sober If you aint the oldest young one for eight years I ever saw
Why I aint sober No no Say Bosn do you like your school as well
as ever

Yes sir I like it better all the time

Do hey And that teacher womango on likin her

The child nodded emphatically Yes sir she said And I havent been
kept after since that once

Sho sho Course you aint So you think Bayports as nice as Concord
do you

Oh lots nicer If mamma was only here Id never want to be anywhere
else And not then maybe unless you was there too

Hum Want to know Say Bosn how would you feel if you had to go
somewheres else

To live Have we got to Id feel dreadful of course But if youve
got to go Uncle Cyrus why

Me No I aint got to go anywheres But twas you I was thinkin of
Wouldnt want to leave the old man hey

To leave YOU Oh Uncle Cyrus

She was staring at him now and her chin was trembling

Uncle she demanded you aint going to send me away Havent I been
a good girl

The captains lips shut tight He waited a moment before replying
Deed youve been a good girl he said brusquely I never saw a
better one No I aint goin to SEND you away Dont you worry about
that

But Alicia Atkins said one time you told somebody you was going to send
me out West after a while I didnt believe it then shes so mean
but she said you said

SAID Captain Cy groaned The Lord knows what I aint said Ive been
a fool dearie and its a judgment on me I guess

But aint you goin to keep me II

She sobbed The captain stroked her hair

Keep you he muttered Yes by the big dipper Im goin to keep you
if I canif I can

Hello said a voice The pair looked up The man who had arrived on
the previous night stood in the sittingroom doorway How long he had
been standing there the captain did not know What he did know was that
Mr John Smith by daylight was not more prepossessing than the same
individual viewed by the aid of a lamp

Emily saw the stranger and slid from Captain Cys knees The captain
rose

Bosn he said this is MrerSmith whos goin to make us a
little visit I want you to shake hands with him

The girl dutifully approached Mr Smith and extended her hand He took
it and held it in his own

Is this the he began

Captain Cy bowed assent

Yes he said his eyes fixed on the visitors face Yes Dont forget
what you said last night

Smith shook his head

No he replied I aint the kind that forgets unless it pays pretty
well Theres some things Ive remembered for quite a few years

He looked the child over from head to foot and his brows drew together
in an ugly frown

So this is her hey he muttered musingly Humph Well I dont know
as Id have guessed it Favors the other side of the house morethe
respectable side I should say Still theres a little brand of the
lost sheep hey Enough to prove property huh Mark of the beast I
spose the psalmsingin relations would call it Dn em I

Steady broke in the captain Mr Smith started seemed to remember
where he was and his manner changed

Come and see me honey he coaxed drawing the girl toward him by
the hand he was holding Aint you got a nice kiss for me this fine
mornin Dont be scared I wont bite

Bosn looked shrinkingly at Mr Smiths unshaven cheeks and then at
Captain Cy The latters face was absolutely devoid of expression He
merely nodded

So Emily kissed one of the bristling cheeks The kiss was returned full
upon the mouth She wiped her lips and darted away to her chair by the
table

Whats your hurry inquired the visitor Dont I do it right Been
some time since I kissed a girla little one anyhow he added
winking at his host Never mind well know each other better by and
by

He looked on in wondering disgust as Bosn said her grace

What in blazes he burst out when the little blessing was finished
Who put her up to that A leftover from the psalmsingers is it

I dont know answered the captain speaking with deliberation I do
know that I like to have her do it and that she shall do it as longs
shes at this table

Oh she shall hey Well I reckon

She shallAS LONG AS SHES AT THIS TABLE Is that real plain and
understandable or shall I write it down

There was an icy clearness in the captains tone which seemed to freeze
further conversation on the part of Mr Smith He merely grunted and ate
his breakfast in silence He ate a great deal and ate it rapidly

Bosn departed for school when the meal was over Captain Cy helped her
on with her coat and hood Then as he always did of late he kissed her
goodby

Hi called Mr Smith from the sitting room Aint I in on that If
theres any kisses goin I want to take a hand before the deals over

Must I whispered Bosn pleadingly Must I Uncle Cy I dont want
to I dont like him

Come on called Mr Smith Im gettin over my bashfulness fast
Hurry up

Must I kiss him Uncle Cyrus whispered Bosn MUST I

No snapped the captain sharply Trot right along now dearie Be a
good girl Goodby

He entered the sitting room His guest had found the Sunday box and was
lighting one of his hosts cigars

Well he inquired easily whats next on the bill Anything goin on
in this forsaken hole

Theres a barber shop down the road You might go there first I should
say Not that you need it but just as a novelty like

Humph I dont know Whats the matter with your razor

Nothin At least I aint found anything wrong with it yet

Oh Say look here youre a queer guy you are I aint got you right
in my mind yet One minute butter wouldnt melt in your mouth and the
next youre fresh as a new egg What IS your little game anyway Youve
got one so dont tell me you aint

Captain Cy was plainly embarrassed He gazed at the Shore to Shore
picture on the wall as he answered

No game about it he said Last night you and I agreed that nothin
was to be said for a few days You was to stay here and Id try to make
you comfortble thats all Then wed see about that other matter
settle on a fair price and

Yes I know Thats all right But youre too willin Theres
something else Say The ugly scowl was in evidence again Say look
here you you aint got somethin up your sleeve have you There aint
somethin more that I dont know about is there No more secrets than
that

No You hear me No Youll get your rights and maybe a little more
than your rights if youre decent And itll pay you to be decent

Humph Mr Smith seemed to be thinking Then he added looking up
keenly under his brows How about thethe incumbrance on the property
Of course when I go Ill have to take that with me and

Captain Cy interrupted

There there he exclaimed and there was a shake in his voice
there there Dont lets talk about such things now IILets wait
a spell Well have some more plans to make maybe If you want to use
my razor its right in that drawer Just help yourself

The visitor laughed aloud He nodded as if satisfied Ho ho he
chuckled I see Humph yesI see The fools aint all dead and
theres none to beat an old one Well well All right pard I guess
you and mell get along fine Ive changed my mind I WILL go to the
barber shop after all Only Im a little shy of dust just at present
So to oblige a friend maybe youll hand over huh

The captain reached into his pocket extracted a twodollar bill and
passed it to the speaker Mr Smith smiled and shook his head

You cant come in on that pard he said The limits five

Captain Cy took back the bill and exchanged it for one with a V in each
corner The visitor took it and turned toward the door

Ta ta he said taking his hat from the peg in the dining room
Im off for the clippers When I come back Ill be the sweetest little
Willie in the diggins So long

Bosn and the captain sat down to the dinner at noon alone Mr Smith
had not returned from his trip to the barbers He came in however
just before the meal was over still in an unshorn condition somewhat
flushed and very loquacious

Say he exclaimed genially That Simpsons the right sort aint he
Him and me took a shine to each other from the gooff Hes been West
himself and hes got some width to him Hes no psalm singer

Humph commented the captain with delicate sarcasm He dont seem
to be much of a barber either Whats the matter Gone out of business
has he Or was you so wild or woolly he got discouraged before he
begun

Great snakes exclaimed the visitor I forgot all about the clippers
Well thats one on me pard Ill make a new try soons grubs over
Dont be so tightfisted with the steak this is a plate Im passin
not a contribution box

He winked at Bosn and would have chucked her under the chin if she had
not dodged She seemed to have taken a great aversion to Mr Smith and
was plainly afraid of him

Is he going to stay very long Uncle Cyrus she whispered when it was
school time once more Do you think hes nice

Captain Cy did not answer When she had gone and the guest had risen
from the table and put on his hat the captain said warningly

Theres one little bit of advice I want to give you Mister Man A
bargains a bargain but it takes two to keep it Dont let your love
for Tad Simpson lead you into talkin too much Talks cheap they say
but too much of it might be mighty dear for you Understand

Smith patted him on the back Lord love you pard he chuckled Im
no spring chicken Im as hard to open as a safe I am It takes a can
opener to get anything out of me

Yes well you can get inside some folks easier with a corkscrew Ive
been told that Tads a kind of a medium sometimes If he raises any
spirits in that back room of his Id leave em alone if I was you So
long as youre decent Ill put up with

But Mr Smith was on his way to the gate whistling as if he hadnt a
care in the world Captain Cy watched him go down the road and then
with the drawn weary look on his face which had been there since the
day before he entered the sitting room and threw himself into a chair

Miss Phoebe Dawes the school teacher worked late that evening There
were examination papers to be gone over and experience had demonstrated
that the only place where she could be free from interruptions was the
schoolroom itself At the perfect boarding house the shrill tones of
Keturahs voice and those of Miss Phinney and Mrs Tripp penetrated
through shut doors It is hard to figure percentages when the most
intimate details of Bayports family life are being recited and gloated
over on the other side of a thin partition And when Matilda undertook
to defend the ComeOuter faith against the assaults of the majority the
verbal riot was as Mr Tidditt described it like feedin time in a
parrot shop

So Miss Phoebe came to the boarding house for supper and then returned
to the schoolroom where with a lighted bracket lamp beside her on the
desk she labored until nine oclock Then she put on her coat and hat
extinguished the light locked the door and started on her lonely walk
home

The main road in our village is dark after nine o clock There is
a street lighta kerosene lampon a post in front of the Methodist
meeting house but the sexton forgets it generally speaking or at
any rate neglects to fill it except at rare intervals Simmonss front
windows are ablaze of course and so are the dingy panes of Simpsons
barber shop But these two centers of sociability are both at the depot
road corner and when they are passed the only sources of illumination
are the scattered gleams from the back windows of dwellings As most
of us retire by halfpast eight the glow along the main road is not
dazzling to say the very least

Miss Dawes was not afraid of the dark She had been her own escort for
a good many years She walked briskly on heard the laughter and loud
voices in the barber shop die away behind her passed the schoolhouse
pond now bleak and chill with the raw November wind blowing across it
and began to climb the slope of Whittakers Hill And here the wind
rushing in unimpeded over the flooded salt meadows from the tumbled
bay outside wound her skirts about her and made climbing difficult and
breathtaking

She was perhaps half way up the long slope when she heard in the
intervals between the gusts footsteps behind her She knew most of
the village people by this time and the thought of company was not
unpleasant So she paused and pantingly waited for whoever was coming
She could not see more than a few yards but the footsteps sounded
nearer and nearer and a moment later a mans voice began singing
Annie Rooney a melody then past its prime in the cities but
popularized in Bayport by some departed batch of summer boarders

She did not recognize the voice and she did not particularly approve of
singing in the streets especially such loud singing So she decided not
to wait longer and was turning to continue her climb when the person
behind stopped his vocalizing and called

Hi he shouted Hello ahead there Who is it Hold on a minute
pard Im comin

She disobeyed the order to hold on and began to hurry The hurry was
of no avail however for the follower broke into a run and soon was by
her side He was a stranger to her

Whee Wow he panted This is no race track pard Pull up and lets
take it easy My off legs got a kink in it and I dont run so easy as
I used to Great snakes whats your rush Aint you fond of company
Hello I believe its a woman

She did not answer His manner and the smell of liquor about him were
decidedly unpleasant The idea that he might be a tramp occurred to her
Tramps are our bugaboos here in Bayport

A woman exclaimed the man hilariously Well say I didnt believe
there was one loose in this tailend of nowhere Girlie Im glad to see
you Not that I can see you much but never mind All cats are gray in
the dark hey You cant see me neither so well take each other on
trust Shes my sweetheart Im her beau Say Maud may I see you
home

She was frightened now The Whittaker place on the hilltop was the
nearest house and that was some distance off

Whats the matter Carrie inquired the man Dont be scared I
wouldnt hurt you Im just lonesome thats all and I need society
Dont rush youll ruin your complexion Here come under my wing and
lets toddle along together Hows mamma

He seized her arm and pulled her back beside him She tried to free
herself but could not Her unwelcome escort held her fast and she was
obliged to move as slowly as he did It was very dark

Say what IS your name coaxed the man Is is Maud hey Or Julia I
always liked Julia Dont be peevish Tell us thats a good girl

She gave a quick jerk and managed to pull her arm from his grasp
giving him a violent push as she did so He being unsteady on his feet
tumbled down the low bank which edged the sidewalk Then she ran on up
the hill as fast as she could She heard him swear as he fell

She had nearly reached the end of the Whittaker fence when he caught
her He was laughing and that alarmed her almost as much as if he had
been angry

Naughty naughty he chuckled holding her fast Tryin to sneak was
you Not much Not this time Did you ever play forfeits when you was
little Well this is a forfeit game and youre It You must bow to the
prettiest kneel to the wittiest and kiss the one you love best And
Ill let you off on the first two Come now Pay up

Then she screamed And her scream was answered at once A gate swung
back with a bang and she heard some one running along the walk toward
her

O Capn Whittaker she called Come Come quick please

How she knew that the person running toward her was Captain Cy has
not been satisfactorily explained even yet She cannot explain it
and neither can the captain And equally astonishing was the latters
answer He certainly had not heard her voice often enough to recognize
it under such circumstances

All right teacher he shouted Im comin Let go of that woman
youOh its you is it

He had seized Mr Smith by the coat collar and jerked him away from his
victim Miss Dawes took refuge behind the captains bulky form The two
men looked at each other Smith was recovering his breath

Its you is it repeated Captain Cy Then turning to Miss Phoebe he
asked Did he hurt you

No Not yet But he frightened me dreadfully Who is he Do you know
him

Her persecutor answered the question

You bet your life he knows me he snarled He knows me mighty well
Pard you keep your nose out of this dyou see You mind your own
business I want goin to hurt her any

The captain paid no attention to him

Yup I know him he said grimly Then he added pointing toward the
lighted window of the house ahead YouSmith you go in there and stay
there Trot Dont make me speak twice

But Mr Smith was too far gone with anger and the spirits raised by
Tad Simpson to heed the menace in the words

Smith hey he sneered Oh yes SMITH Well Smith aint goin
dyou see Hes goin to do what he pleases I reckon Im on top of the
roost here I know whats what You cant talk to me Ive got rights I
have and

Blast your rights

What WHAT Blast my rights hey Oh yes Think because youve got
money you can cheat me out of em do you Well you cant And how
about the other part of those rights Spose I walk right into that
house and

Stop it Shut up Youd better not

And into that bedroom and just say Emmie heres your

He didnt finish the sentence Captain Cys big fist struck him fairly
between the eyes and the back of his head struck the walk with a
smack Then through the fireworks which were illuminating his muddled
brain he heard the captains voice

You low  down good  for  nothin scamp growled Captain Cy All
this day Ive been hatin myself for the way Ive acted to you Ive
hated myself and been tryin to spunk up courage to say Its all off
But I was too much of a coward I guess And now the Lord Amighty has
MADE me say it You want your rights do you So Then get em if you
can Its you and me for it and well see whos the best man Teacher
if youre ready Ill walk home with you now

Mr Smith was not entirely cowed

You go he yelled Go ahead And Ill go to a lawyers tomorrow But
tonight and inside of five minutes Ill walk into that house of yours
and get my

The captain dropped Miss Dawess arm and strode back to where his
antagonist was sitting in the dust of the walk Stooping down he shook
a big forefinger in the mans face

Youve been out West they tell me he whispered sternly Yes Well
out West they take the law into their own hands sometimes I hear Ive
been in South America and they do it there too Just so sure as you
go into my house tonight and touchwell you know what I meanjust
so sure Ill kill you like a dog if I have to chase you to Jericho Now
you can believe that or not If I was you Id believe it

Taking the frightened schoolmistress by the arm once more he walked
away Mr Smith said nothing till they had gone some distance Then he
called after them

You wait till tomorrow he shouted You just wait and see whatll
happen tomorrow

Captain Cy was silent all the way to the gate of the perfect boarding
house Miss Dawes was silent likewise but she thought a great deal At
the gate she said

Captain Whittaker Im EVER so much obliged to you I cant thank you
enough

Dont try then Thats what you said to me about the cow

But Im almost sorry you were the one to come Im afraid that man will
get you into trouble Has hecan heWhat did he mean about tomorrow
Who IS he

The captain pushed his cap back from his forehead

Teacher he said theres a proverb aint there about lettin
tomorrow take care of itself As for troublewell I did think Id had
trouble enough in my life to last me through but I callate Ive got
another guess Anyhow dont you fret I did just the right thing
and Im glad I did it If it was only me I wouldnt fret either But
theres He stopped groaned and pulled the cap forward again Good
night he added and turned to go

Miss Dawes leaned forward and detained him

Just a minute Capn Whittaker she said I was a little prejudiced
against you when I came here I was told that you got me the teachers
position and there was more than a hint that you did it for selfish
reasons of your own When you called that afternoon at the school I
was

Dont say a word I was the biggest fool in town that time and Ive
been ashamed to look in the glass ever since I aint always such an
idiot

But Ive had to judge people for myself in my lifetime continued the
schoolmistress and Ive made up my mind that I was mistaken about
you I should like to apologize Will you shake hands

She extended her hand Captain Cy hesitated

Hadnt you better wait a spell he asked Youve heard that swab call
me partner Hadnt

No I dont know what your trouble is of course and I certainly
shant mention it to anyone But whatever it is Im sure you are right
and its not your fault Now will you shake hands

The captain did not answer He merely took the proffered hand shook it
heartily and strode off into the dark



CHAPTER XII

TOWNMEETIN


This is goin to be a meMOriable town meetin declared Sylvanus
Cahoon with unction rising from the settee to gaze about him over the
heads of the voters in the townhall I bet you every ablebodied man
in Bayport ll be here this forenoon Yes sir thats what I call it a
meMOriable meetin

See anything of Cy inquired Josiah Dimick who sat next to Sylvanus

No he aint come yet And Heman aint here neither Hello theres
Tad Looks happy seems to me

Captain Dimick stood up to inspect Mr Simpson

Humph he muttered Well unless my counts wrong he aint got much
to be happy about Lonzo Snows with him Tad does look sort of joyful
dont he Them that laughs last laughs best When the vote for school
committees all in well see who does the grinnin But I cant
understandHello theres Tidditt Asaph Ase Sstt Come here a
minute

Mr Tidditt trembling with excitement and shaking hands effusively
with everyone he met pushed his way up the aisle and bent over his
friend

Say Ase whispered Josiah wheres Whit Why aint he on hand
Nothins happened has it

No replied the town clerk Everything seems to be all right I
stopped in on the way along and Cy said not to wait hed be here on
time Hes been kind of off his feed for the last day or so and I
callate he didnt feel like hurryin Say Joe now honest what do you
think of my chances

Such a confirmed joker as Dimick couldnt lose an opportunity like
this With the aid of one trying to be cheerful under discouragement he
answered that so far Asaphs chances looked fair pretty fair but of
course you couldnt always sometimes tell Mr Tidditt rushed away to
begin the handshaking all over again

From this round of cordiality he was reluctantly torn and conducted to
the platform After thumping the desk with his fist he announced that
the gathering would come to order right off as there was considerble
business to be done and it ought to be goin ahead He then proceeded
to read the call for the meeting This ceremony was no sooner over than
Abednego Small Uncle Bedny was on his feet loudly demanding to
be informed why the town hadnt done nothin toward fixing up the
Bassetts Hollow road Uncle Bednys speech had proceeded no further
than Feller citizens in the name of an outrageousI should say
outraged portion of our community I when he was choked off by a
selfappointed committee who knew Mr Small of old and had seated
themselves near him to be ready for just such emergencies The next
step judged by meetings of other years should have been to unanimously
elect Eben Salters moderator but as Captain Eben refused to serve
owing to his interest in the Whittaker campaign Alvin Knowles was by a
small majority chosen for that office Mr Knowles was a devout admirer
of the great Atkins and his election would have been considered a
preliminary victory for the opposition had it not been that many of
Captain Cys adherents voted for Alvin from a love of mischief knowing
from experience his ignorance of parliamentary law and his easygoing
rule Now therell be fun declared one delighted individual
Anythings in order when Alvins chairman

The proceedings of the first half hour were disappointingly tame Most
of us had come there to witness a political wrestling match between
Tad Simpson and Cyrus Whittaker Some even dared hope that Congressman
Atkins might direct his fight in person But neither the Honorable
nor Captain Cy was in the hall as yet Solon Eldridge was reelected
selectman and so also was Asaph Tidditt Nobody but Asaph seemed
surprised at this result His speech of acceptance would undoubtedly
have been a triumph of oratory had it not been interrupted by Uncle
Bedny who rose to emphatically protest against settin round and
wastin time when the Bassetts Hollow road had ruts deep enough to
drown a cat in whenever there was a moren average heavy dew

The Bassetts Hollow delegate being again temporarily squelched
Moderator Knowles announced that nominations for the vacant place on
the school committee were in order There was a perceptible stir on the
settees This was what the meeting had been waiting for

No sign of Cy or Heman yet observed Mr Cahoon craning his neck in
the direction of the door Its the queerest thing ever I see

Queer enough about Cy thats a fact concurred Captain Dimick I
aint so surprised about Hemans not comin Looks as if Whit was right
he always said Atkins dodged a row where folks could watch it Does most
of his fightin from round the corner Hello theres Tad Now youll
see the crown of glory set on Lonzo Snows head Hope the crowns
padded nice and soft Anything with sharp edges would sink in

But Mr Simpson it seemed was not yet ready to proceed with the
coronation He had risen to ask permission of the meeting to defer the
school committee matter for a short time Persons important persons
who should be present while the nominating was going on had not yet
arrived He was sure that the gathering would wish to hear from these
persons He asked for only a slight delay Matters such as this
affecting the welfare of our posterity ought not to be hurried etc
etc

Mr Simpsons request was unexpected The meeting apparently didnt
know how to take it Uncle Bedny was firmly held in his seat by those
about him Lemuel Myrick took the floor to protest

I must say he declared that I dont see any reason for waitin If
folks aint here thats their own fault Mr Moderator I demand that
the nominatin go ahead

Tad was on his feet instantly

Im goin to appeal he cried to the decency and gratitude of the
citizens of the town of Bayport One of the persons Imthat is were
waitin for has done more for our beautiful village than all the rest
of us put together There aint no need for me to name him A right
uptodate town pump a lovely memorial window a

How about that harbor appropriation cried a voice from the settees

Mr Simpson was taken aback His face flushed and he angrily turned
toward the interrupter

Thats you Joe Dimick he shouted pointing an agitated forefinger
You neednt scooch down I know your tongue The idea of you findin
fault because a big man like Congressman Atkins dont jump when you
holler Git up What do YOU know about doins at Washington That
harbor appropriation ll go through if anybody on earth can get it
through Theres other places besides Bayport to be provided for and

And their congressmen provide for em called another voice Tad
whirled to face his new tormentor

Huh he grunted with sarcasm Thats Lem Myrick _I_ know Lem the
great painter who votes where he paints and gets paid accordin

Order cried several

Oh all right Mr Moderator Ill keep order all right But I say to
you Lem and you Joe Dimick that I know who put these smart notions
into your heads We all know unless were born fools Who is it thats
been sayin the Honorable Heman Atkins was shirkin that appropriation
Who was it said if HE was representative the thing would have gone
through afore this Whos been makin his brags that he could get it
through if he had the chance You know who So do I I wish he was here
I only wish he was here Id say it to his face

Well he is Heave ahead and say it

Everyone turned toward the door Captain Cy had entered the hall He was
standing in the aisle and with him was Bailey Bangs The captain looked
very tired almost worn out but he nodded coolly to Mr Simpson
who had retired to his seat with surprising quickness and apparent
discomfiture

Here I am Tad continued the captain Say your piece

But Tad it appeared was not anxious to say his piece He was
whispering earnestly with a group of his followers Captain Cy held up
his hand

Mr Moderator he asked can I have the floor a minute All I want to
say is that I callate Im the feller the last speaker had reference to
I HAVE said that I didnt see why that appropriation was so hard to get
I say it again Other appropriations are got and why not ours I DID
say if I was a congressman Id get it Yes and Ill say more he
added raising his voice Ill say that if I was sent to Washinton
by this town congressman or not Id move heaven and earth and all
creation from the President down till I did get it Thats all So would
any live man I should think

He sat down There was some applause Before it had subsided Abel
Leonard one of the quickestwitted of Mr Simpsons workers was on his
feet gesticulating for attention

Mr Moderator he shouted I want to make a motion Weve all heard
the big talk thats been made All right then I move you sir
that Captain Cyrus Whittaker be appointed a committee of one to GO to
Washinton if he wants to or anywheres else and see that we get the
appropriation And if we dont get it the blames his There now

There was a roar of laughter This was exactly the sort of titfortat
humor that appeals to a Yankee crowd The motion was seconded half a
dozen times Moderator Knowles grinned and shook his head

A jokes a joke he said and we all like a good one However this
meetin is supposed to be for business not fun so

Question Question Its been seconded Weve got to vote on it
shouted a chorus

Dont you thinkseems to me that aint in order began the moderator
but Captain Cy rose to his feet The grim smile had returned to his face
and he looked at the joyous assemblage with almost his old expression of
appreciative alertness

Never mind the vote he said I realize that Brother Leonard has
rather got one on me so to speak All right I wont dodge Ill BE
a committee of one on the harbor grab and if nothin comes of it Ill
take my share of kicks Gentlemen I appreciate your trustfulness in my
ability

This brief speech was a huge success If for a moment the pendulum
of public favor had swung toward Simpson this trumping of the latters
leading card pushed it back again The moderator had some difficulty in
restoring order to the hilarious meeting

Then Mr Myrick was accorded the privilege of the floor in spite of
Tads protests and proceeded to nominate Cyrus Whittaker for the school
committee Lem had devoted hours of toil and wearisome mental struggle
to the preparation of his address and it was lengthy and florid
Captain Cy was described as possessing all the virtues Bailey
listening with a hand behind his ear was moved to applause at frequent
intervals and even Asaph forgot the dignity of his exalted position on
the platform and pounded the official desk in ecstasy The only person
to appear uninterested was the nominee himself He sat listlessly in his
seat his eyes cast down and his thoughts apparently far away

Josiah Dimick seconded the captains nomination Then Mr Simpson
stepped to the front and after a wistful glance at the door began to
speak

Feller citizens he said it is my privilege to put in nomination for
school committee a man whose name stands for all thats good and clean
and progressive in this township But afore I do it Im goin to ask
you to let me say a word or two concernin somethin that bears right on
this matter and which I believe everyone of you ought to know Its
somethin that most of you dont know and itll be a surprise a big
surprise Ill be as quick as I can and I callate youll thank me when
Im done

He paused The meeting looked at each other in astonishment There was
whispering along the settees Moderator Knowles was plainly puzzled He
looked inquiringly at the town clerk but Asaph was evidently quite as
much in the dark as he concerning the threatened disclosure

Feller Bayporters went on Tad theres one thing weve all agreed
on no matter who weve meant to vote for That is that a member of our
school committee should be an upright honest man one fit morally to
look out for our dear children Aint that so Well then I ask you
this Would you consider a man fit for that job who deliberately came
between a father and his child who pizened the mind of that child
against his own parent and when that parent come to claim that child
first tried to buy him off and then turned him out of the house Yes
and offered violence to him And done itmark what I sayfor reasons
whichwhichwell we can only guess em but the guess may not be so
awful bad Is THAT the kind of man we want to honor or to look out for
our own childrens schoolin

Mr Simpson undoubtedly meant to cause a sensation by his opening
remarks He certainly did so The stir and whispering redoubled Asaph
his mouth open stared wildly down at Captain Cy The captain rose to
his feet then sank back again His listlessness was gone and paying no
attention to those about him he gazed fixedly at Tad

Gentlemen continued the speaker last night I had an experience that
I shant forget as long as I live I met a poor man a poor lame man
whod been away out West and got hurt bad Folks thought he was dead
His wife thought so and died grievin for him She left a little baby
girl only seven or eight year old When this man come back well again
but poor to look up his family he found his wife had passed away and
the child had been sent off just to get rid of her to a stranger in
another town That stranger fully meant to send her off too he said so
dozens of times A good many of you folks right here heard him say it
But he never sent herhe kept her Why Well thats the question _I_
shant answer it _I_ aint accusin nobody All I say is whats easy
enough for any of you to prove and that is that it come to light the
child had property belongin to her Property land wuth money

He paused once more and drew his sleeve across his forehead Most of
his hearers were silent now on tiptoe of expectation Dimick looked
searchingly at Captain Cy Then he sprang to his feet

Order he shouted Whats all this got to do with nominatin for
school committee Aint he out of order Alvin

The moderator hesitated His habitual indecision was now complicated
by the fact that he was as curious as the majority of those before him
There were shouts of Go ahead Tad Tell us the rest Let him go
on Mr Moderator

Cy Whittaker slowly rose

Alvin he said earnestly dont stop him yet As a favor to me let
him spin his yarn

Simpson was ready and evidently eager to spin it

This man he proclaimed this father mournin for his dead wife and
longin for his child comes to the town where he was to find and take
her And when he meets the man thats got her when he comes poor and
down on his luck what does this manthis rich mando Why fust of
all hes sweetern sirup to him takes him in keeps him overnight
and the next day he says to him You just be quiet and say nothin to
nobody that shes your little girl Ill make it wuth your while
Keep quiet till Im ready for you to say it And he gives the father
moneynot much but some All right so fur maybe but wait Then it
turns out that the father knows about this landthis property And
THEN the kind charitable manthis rich man with lots of money of his
ownturns the poor father out tellin him to get the girl and the land
if he can knowinKNOWIN mind youthat the father aint got a cent
to hire lawyers nor even to pay for his next meal And when the father
says he wont go but wants his dear one that belongs to him the rich
feller abuses him knocks him down with his fist Knocks down a poor
weak lame invalid just off a sick bed Is THAT the kind of a man we
want on our school committee

He asked the question with both hands outspread and the perspiration
running down his cheeks The meeting was in an uproar

No need for me to tell you who I mean shouted Tad waving his arms
You know who as well as I do Youve just heard him praised as bein
all thats good and great But _I_ say

Youve said enough Now let me say a word

It was Captain Cy who interrupted He had pushed his way through the
crowd down the aisle and now stood before the gesticulating Mr
Simpson who shrank back as if he feared that the treatment accorded the
poor weak invalid might be continued with him

Knowles said Captain Cy turning to the moderator let me speak
will you I wont be but a minute Friends he continued facing the
excited gatheringfor some of you are my friends or Ive come to
think you area part of what this man says is so The girl at my house
is Emily Thomas her mother was Mary Thomas who some of you know and
her fathers name is Henry Thomas She came to me unexpected bein sent
by a Mrs Oliver up to Concord because twas either me or an orphan
asylum I took her in meanin to keep her a little while and then send
her away But as time went on I kept puttin off and puttin off and at
last I realized I couldnt do it Id come to think too much of her

Fellers he went on slowly II hardly know how to tell you what
that little girls come to be to me When I first struck Bayport after
forty years away from it all I thought of was makin over the old place
and livin in it I callated it would be a sort of Paradise and HOW I
was goin to live or whether or not Id be lonesome with everyone of my
folks dead and gone never crossed my mind But the longer I lived there
alone the less like Paradise it got to be I realized more and more
that it aint furniture and fixins that make a home its them you love
thats in it And just as Id about reached the conclusion that twas a
failure the whole business why then BosnEmily that isdropped
in and inside of a week I knew Id got what was missin in my life

I never married and children never meant much to me till I got her
Shes the best littlelittle    There I mustnt talk this way I
bluffed a lot about not keepin her permanent bein kind of ashamed
I guess but down inside me Id made up my mind to bring her up like
a daughter She and me was to live together till she grew up and got
married and I    Well whats the use A few days ago come a letter
from the Oliver woman in Concord sayin that this Henry Thomas Bosns
father want dead at all but had turned up there havin learned
somehow or nother that his wife was gone and that his child had been
willed a little bit of land which belonged to her mother He had found
out that Emmie was with me and the letter said he would likely come
after herand the land

That letter was like a flash of lightnin to me I was dismasted and
on my beam ends I didnt know what to do Id learned enough about this
Henry Thomas to know that he was no use a drunken goodfornothin
scamp who had cruelized his wife and then run off and left her and the
baby But when he come the very night I got the letter I gave him a
chance I took him in I was willin to give him a job on the place
I was willin to pay for his keep and more I DID ask him to keep his
mouth shut and even to use another name Twas weak of me maybe but
you want to remember this had come on me sudden And last nightthe
very second night mind youhe went out somewhere perhaps we can guess
where bought liquor with the money I gave him got drunk and then
insulted one of the best women in this town Yes sir I say it right
here one of the best pluckiest little women anywhere although she and
I aint always agreed on certain matters I DID tell him to clear out
and I DID knock him down Yes and by the big dipper Id do it again
under the same circumstances

As for the property he added fiercely why darn the property I
say It aint wuth much anyhow and if twas anybodys else he should
have it and welcome But its Bosns and bein what he is he SHANT
have it And he shant have HER to cruelize neither By the Almighty
he shant so long as Ive got a dollar to fight him with I say that to
you Tad Simpson and to the manto whoever put you up to this There
Ive said my say Now gentlemen you can choose your side

He strode back to his seat There was silence for a moment Then Josiah
Dimick sprang up and waved his hat

Thats the way to talk he shouted Thats a MAN Three cheers for
Capn Whittaker Come on everybody

But everybody did not come on The cheers were feeble It was evident
that the majority of those present did not know how to meet this
unexpected contingency It had taken them by surprise and they were
undecided The uproar of argument and question began again louder than
ever The bewildered moderator thumped his desk and shouted feebly for
order Tad Simpson took the floor and in a few words and at the top of
his lungs nominated Alonzo Snow Abel Leonard seconded the nomination
There were yells of Question Question and Vote Vote

Eben Salters was recognized by the chair Captain Salters made few
speeches and when he did make one it was because he had something to
say

Mr Moderator he said I for one hate to vote just now It isnt
that the school committee is so important of itself But I do think that
the rights of a father with his child IS pretty important and our vote
for Capn Whittakerand most of you know I intended votin for him
and have been workin for himmight seem like an indorsement of his
position This whole thing is a big surprise to me I dont feel yet
that we know enough of the inside facts to give such an indorsement Id
like to see this Thomas man before I decide to give itor not to give
it either Its a queer thing to come up at town meetin but its up
Hadnt we better adjourn until next week

He sat down The meeting was demoralized Some were shouting for
adjournment others to Vote it out A straw would turn the scale and
the straw was forthcoming While Captain Cy was speaking the door had
silently opened and two men entered the hall and sought seclusion in a
corner Now one of these men came forwardthe Honorable Heman Atkins

Mr Atkins walked solemnly to the front amidst a burst of recognition
Many of the voters rose to receive him It was customary when the great
man condescended to attend such gatherings to offer him a seat on the
platform This the obsequious Knowles proceeded to do Asaph was
too overcome by the disclosure of John Smiths identity and by Mr
Simpsons attack on his friend to remember even his manners He did not
rise but sat stonily staring

The moderators gavel descended Order he roared Order I say
Congressman Atkins is goin to talk to us

The Honorable Heman faced the excited crowd One hand was in the breast
of his frock coat the other was clenched upon his hip He stood calm
benignant dignifiedthe incarnation of wisdom and righteous worth The
attitude had its effect the applause began and grew to an ovation
Men who had intended voting against his favored candidate forgot their
intention in the magnetism of his presence and cheered He bowed and
bowed again

Fellow townsmen he began far be it from me to influence your choice
in the matter of the school committee Still further be it from me to
influence you against an old boyhood friend a neighbor one whom I
believeerhad believed to be all that was sincere and true But
fellow townsmen my esteemed friend Captain Salters has expressed a
wish to see Mr Thomas the father whose story you have heard today
I happen to be in a position to gratify that wish Mr Thomas will you
kindly come forward

Then from the rear of the hall Mr Thomas came But the drunken rowdy
of the night before had been transformed Gone was the scrubby beard
and the shabby suit Shorn was the unkempt mop of hair and vanished the
impudent swagger He was dressed in clean linen and respectable black
and his manner was modest and subdued Only a discoloration of one eye
showed where Captain Cys blow had left its mark

He stepped upon the platform beside the congressman The latter laid a
hand upon his shoulder

Gentlemen and friends said Heman my name has been brought into
this controversy by Mr Simpson directly and in insinuation
byeranother Therefore it is my right to make my position clear Mr
Thomas came to me last evening in distress both of mind and body He
told me his storysubstantially the story which has just been told
to you by Mr Simpsonand gentlemen I believe it But if I did not
believe it if I believed him to have been in the past all that his
opponent has said even if I believed that only last evening spurned
driven from his child penniless and hopeless he had yielded to the
weakness which has been his curse all his lifeeven if I believed that
still I should demand that Henry Thomas repentant and earnest as you
see him now should be given his rightful opportunity to become a
man again He is poor but he is notshall not befriendless No a
thousand times no You may say some of you that the affair is not
my business I affirm that it IS my business It is my business as a
Christian and that business should come before all others I have not
allowed sympathy to influence me If that were the case my regard for
my neighbor and friend of former days would have held me firm But
gentlemen I have a child of my own I know what a fathers love is as
only a father can know it And after a sleepless night I stand here
before you today determined that this man shall have his own if
my moneywhich you will Im sure forgive my mentioningand my
unflinching support can give it to him That is my position and I state
it regardless of consequences He paused and with raised right hand
like the picture of Jove in the old academy mythology launched his
final thunderbolt Whom God hath joined he proclaimed let no one
put asunder

That settled it The cheers shook the walls Amidst the tumult Dimick
and Bailey Bangs seized Captain Cy by the shoulders and endeavored to
lift him from his seat

For the love of goodness Whit groaned Josiah desperately stand up
and answer him If you dont well founder sure

The captain smiled grimly and shook his head He had not taken his eyes
from the face of the great Atkins since the latter began speaking

What he replied After that put asunder sockdolager Man alive do
you want me to add Sabbath breakin to my other crimes

The vote by ballot followed almost immediately It was pitiful to see
the erstwhile Whittaker majority melt away Alonzo Snow was triumphantly
elected But a handful voted against him

Captain Cy still grimly smiling rose and left the hall As he closed
the door he heard the shrill voice of Uncle Bedny demanding justice for
the Bassetts Hollow road

It had indeed been a memoriable town meeting



CHAPTER XIII

THE REPULSE


When Deacon Zeb Clarkthe same Deacon Zeb who fell into the cistern
as narrated by Captain Cymade his first visit to the city years and
years ago he stayed but two days As he had proudly boasted that he
should remain in the metropolis at least a week our people were much
surprised at his premature return To the driver of the butcher cart who
found him sitting contentedly before his dwelling amidst his desolate
acres the nearest neighbor a half mile away did Deacon Zeb disclose
his reason for leaving the crowded thoroughfares There was so many
folks there he said that I felt lonesome

And Captain Cy returning from the town meeting to the Whittaker place
felt lonesome likewise Not for the Deacons reasonhe met no one on
the main road save a group of school children and Miss Phinney and
sighting the latter in the offing he dodged behind the trees by the
schoolhouse pond and waited until she passed But the captain his
trouble now heavy upon him did feel the need of sympathy and congenial
companionship He knew he might count upon Dimick and Asaph and
whenever Keturahs supervision could be evaded upon Mr Bangs But they
were not the advisers and comforters for this hour of need All the rest
of Bayport he felt sure would be against him Had not King Heman
the Great from the steps of the throne banned him with the royal
displeasure If Heman ever SHOULD come right out and say began
Asaphs warning Well strange as it might seem Heman had come right
out

As to why he had come out there was no question in the mind of the
captain The latter had left Mr Thomas the prodigal father prostrate
and blasphemous in the road the previous evening His next view of
him was when transformed and sanctified he had been summoned to the
platform by Mr Atkins No doubt he had returned to the barber shop
and in his rage and under Mr Simpsons cross examination had revealed
something of the truth Tad the politician recognizing opportunity
when it knocked at his door had hurried him to the congressmans
residence The rest was plain enough so Captain Cy thought

However war was already declared and the reasons for it mattered
little The first skirmish might occur at any moment The situation was
desperate The captain squared his shoulders thrust forward his chin
and walked briskly up the path to the door of the dining room It was
nearly one oclock but Bosn had not yet gone She was waiting to the
very last minute for her Uncle Cyrus

Hello shipmate he hailed Not headed for school yet Good I
callate you neednt go this afternoon Im thinkin of hirin a team
and drivin to Ostable and I didnt know but youd like to go with me
Think you could without that teacher woman havin you brought up aft
for mutiny

Bosn thought it over

Yes sir she said I guess so if you wrote me an excuse I dont
like to be absent cause I havent been before but theres only my
reading lesson this afternoon and I know that ever so well Id love to
go Uncle Cy

The captain removed his coat and hat and pulled a chair forward to the
table

Hello he exclaimed Whats thisthe mail

Bosn smiled delightedly

Yes sir she replied I knew you was at the meeting and so I brought
it from the office Aint you glad

Sure Yes indeed Much obliged Tryin to keep house without you would
be like steerin without a rudder

Even as he said it there came to him the realization that he might have
to steer without that rudder in the near future His smile vanished He
smothered a groan and picked up the mail

Hum he mused the Breeze a circular and one letter Hello it
isnt possible thatWell well

The letter was in a long envelope He hastily tore it open At the
inclosure he glanced in evident excitement Then his smile returned

Bosn he said after a moments reflection I guess you and me
wont have to go to Ostable after all Noticing the childs look of
disappointment he added But you neednt go to school Maybe youd
better not You and mell take a tramp alongshore What do you say

Oh yes Uncle Cy Letsshall we

Why I dont see why not Well cruise in company as long as we
can hey little girl The squalls likely to strike afore night he
muttered half aloud Well enjoy the fine weather till its time to
shorten sail

They walked all that afternoon Captain Cy was even more kind and gentle
with his small companion than usual He told her stories which made her
laugh pointed out spots in the pines where he had played Indian when a
boy carried her pig back when she grew tired and kissed her tenderly
when at the back door of the Whittaker place he set her on her feet
again

Had a good time dearie he asked

Oh splendid I think its the best walk we ever had dont you Uncle
Cy

I shouldnt wonder You wont forget our cruises together when you are
a big girl and off somewheres else will you

Ill NEVER forget em And Im never going anywhere without you

It was after five as they entered the kitchen

Anybody been here while I was out asked the captain of Georgianna
The housekeepers eyes were red and swollen and she hugged Bosn as she
helped her off with her jacket and hood

Yes there has was the decided answer First Ase Tidditt and then
Bailey Bangs and then thatthat Angie Phinney

Humph mused Captain Cy slowly So Angie was here was she Where the
carcass is the vultures are on deck or words similar Humph Did our
Angelic friend have much to say

DID she And _I_ had somethin to say too I never in my life

Humph Her employer eyed her sharply So And so soon Talk about
the telegraph spreadin news Id back most any half dozen tongues in
Bayport to spread more news and add more trimmin to it in a day
than the telegraph could do in a week Especially if all the telegraph
operators was like the one up at the depot Well Georgianna when you
goin to leave

Leave Leave where What are you talkin about

Leave here Of course you realize that this ship of ours indicating
the house by a comprehensive wave of his hand around the room is goin
to be a mighty unpopular craft from now on We may be on a lee shore any
minute Youve got your own wellbein to think of

My own wellbein What do you spose I care for my wellbein when
theresCapn Whittaker you tell me now Is it so

Some of it isyes Hes come back and hes who he says he is Youve
seen him He was here all day yesterday

So Angie said but I couldnt scarcely believe it That toughy Capn
Whittaker do you intend to hand over that poor little innocent thing
toto such a man as THAT

No Therell be no handin over about it But the odds are against us
and theres no reason why you should be in the rumpus Georgianna You
may not understand what were facin

The housekeeper drew herself up Her face was very red and her small
eyes snapped

Cy Whittaker she began manners and deference to employer alike
forgotten dont you say no more of that wicked foolishness to me Ill
leave the minute youre meanspirited enough to let that child go and
not afore And when THAT happens Ill be GLAD to leave Land sakes
theres somebody at the door and I expect Im a perfect sight

She rubbed her face with her apron thereby making it redder than ever
and hurried into the dining room

Bosn said Captain Cy quickly you stay here in the kitchen

Emmie looked at him in surprised bewilderment but she suppressed her
curiosity concerning the identity of the person who had knocked and
obeyed The captain pulled the kitchen door almost shut and listened at
the crack

The first spoken words by the visitor appeared to relieve Captain Cys
anxiety but they seemed to astonish him greatly

Why he exclaimed in a whisper Aint thatIt sounds like

Its teacher whispered Bosn who also had been listening Shes
come to find out why I wasnt at school You tell her Uncle Cy

Georgianna returned to announce

Its Miss Dawes She says she wants to see you Capn Shes in the
settin room

The captain drew a long breath Then repeating his command to Emmie to
stay where she was he left the room closing the door behind him The
latter procedure roused Bosns indignation

What made him do that she demanded I havent been bad He NEVER
shut me up before

The schoolmistress was standing by the center table in the sitting room
when Captain Cy entered

Good evenin he said politely Wont you sit down

But Miss Dawes paid no attention to trivialities She seemed much
agitated

Capn Whittaker she began I just heard something that

The captain interrupted her

Excuse me he said but I think well pull down the curtains and have
a little light on the subject It gets dark early now especially of a
gray day like this one

He drew the shades at the windows and lit the lamp on the table The red
glow behind the panes of the stove door faded into insignificance as
the yellow radiance brightened The ugly portraits and the stiff old
engravings on the wall retired into a becoming dusk The oldfashioned
room became more homelike

Now wont you sit down repeated Captain Cy Take that rocker its
the most comftable one aboardso Bosn says anyhow

Miss Phoebe took the rocker under protest Her host remained standing

Its been a nice afternoon he said BosnEmmie of courseand I
have been for a walk Twant her fault twas mine I kept her out of
school I waswell kind of lonesome

The teachers gray eyes flashed in the lamplight

Capn Whittaker she cried please dont waste time I didnt come
here to talk about the weather nor Emilys reason for not attending
school I dont care why she was absent But I have just heard of what
happened at that meeting Is it true that She hesitated

That Emmies dad is alive and here Yes its true

Butbut that man last night Was he THAT man

The captain nodded

Thats the man he said briefly

Miss Dawes shuddered

Capn Whittaker she asked earnestly are you sure he is really her
father Absolutely sure

Sure and sartin

Then she belongs to him doesnt she Legally I mean

Maybe so

Areare you going to give her up to him

No

Then what I heard was true You did say at the meeting that you were
going to do your best to keep him from getting her

Umhum What I said amounts to just about that

Why

Captain Cy was surprised and a little disappointed apparently

Why he repeated

Yes Why

Well for reasons Ive got

Do you mind telling me the reasons

I callate you dont want to hear em If you dont understand now
then I cant make it much plainer Im afraid

The little lady sprang to her feet

Oh you are provoking she cried indignantly Cant you see that I
want to hear the reasons from you yourself Capn Whittaker I shook
hands with you last night

You remember I told you youd better wait

I didnt want to wait I believed I knew something of human nature and
I believed I had learned to understand you I made up my mind to pay
no more attention to what people said against you I thought they were
envious and disliked you because you did things in your own way I
wouldnt believe the stories I heard this afternoon I wanted to hear
you speak in your own defense and you refuse to do it Dont you
know what people are saying They say you are trying to keep Emily
becauseOh Im ashamed to ask it but you make me HAS the child got
valuable property of her own

Captain Cy had been throughout this scene standing quietly by the
table Now he took a step forward

Miss Dawes he said sharply sit down

But I

Sit down please

The schoolmistress didnt mean to obey the order but for some reason
she did The captain went on speaking

Its pretty plain he said that what you heard at the boardin
housefor I suppose thats where you did hear itwas what you might
call a Phinneyized story of the doins at the meetin Well theres
another yarn and its mine Im goin to spin it and I want you to
listen

He went on to spin his yarn It was practically a repetition of his
reply to Tad Simpson that morning Its conclusion was also much the
same

The land aint worth fifty dollars he declared but if it was fifty
million he shouldnt have it Why Because it belongs to that little
girl And he shant have her until he and those back of him have
hammered me through the courts till Im down forty fathom under water
And when they do get herand to be honest I callate they will in
the endI hope to God I wont be alive to see it There Ive answered
you

He was walking up and down the room with the old quarterdeck stride
his hands jammed deep in his pockets and his face working with emotion

Its pretty nigh a singlehanded fight for me he continued but Ive
fought singlehanded before The other sides got almost all the powder
and the men Heman and Tad and that Thomas have got seven eighths of
Bayport behind em not to mention the Providence theyre so sure of
My crowd is a mighty forlorn hope Dimick and Ase Tidditt and Bailey
as much as his wife ll let him Oh yes and he smiled whimsically
theres another one A new recruits just joined Georgiannas
enlisted Thats my army Sort of ragjacketed cadets we are small
potatoes and few in a hill

The teacher rose and laid a hand on his arm He turned toward her The
lamplight shone upon her face and he saw to his astonishment that
there were tears in her eyes

Capn Whittaker she said will you take an other recruit I should
like to enlist please

You Oh pshaw Im thickheaded tonight I didnt see the joke of it
at first

There isnt any joke I want you to know that I admire you for the
fight youre making Law or no law to let that dear little girl go away
with that dreadful father of hers is a sin and a crime I came here to
tell you so I did want to hear your story and you made me ask that
question but I was certain of your answer before you made it I dont
suppose I can do anything to help but Im going to try So you see
your army is bigger than you thought it wasthough the new soldier
isnt good for much Im afraid she added with a little smile

Captain Cy was greatly disturbed

Miss Phoebe he said II wont say that it dont please me to
have you talk so for it does moren you can imagine Sympathy means
somethin to the under dog and it gives him spunk to keep on kickin
But you mustnt take any part in the row you simply mustnt It wont
do

Why not Wont I be ANY help

Help Youd be more help than all the rest of us put together You and
me havent seen a great deal of each other and my part in the few talks
we have had has been a mean one but I knew the first time I met
you that you had more brains and common sense than any woman in this
countythough I was too pigheaded to own it But that aint it I got
you the job of teacher Its no credit to me twas just bull luck and
for the fun of jarrin Heman But I did it And because I did it the
Atkins crowdand that means most everybody nowhavent any love for
you My tryin for school committee was really just to give you a fair
chance in your position I was licked so the committees two to one
against you Dont you see that you mustnt have anything to do with me
Dont you SEE it

She shook her head

I see that common gratitude alone should be reason enough for my trying
to help you she said But beside that I know you are right and I
SHALL help no matter what you say As for the teachers position let
them discharge me I

Dont talk that way The youngsters need you and know it no matter
what their fool fathers and mothers say And you mustnt wreck your
chances Youre young

She laughed

Oh no Im not she said Young Capn Whittaker you shouldnt joke
about a womans age

I aint jokin You ARE young As she stood there before him he was
realizing with a curiously uncomfortable feeling how much younger she
was than he He glanced up at the mirror where his own gray hairs were
reflected and repeated his assertion Youre young yet he said and
bein discharged from a place might mean a whole lot to you Im
glad you take such an interest in Bosn and your comin here on her
account

He paused Miss Dawes colored slightly and said

Yes

Your comin here on her account was mighty good of you But youve got
to keep out of this trouble And you mustnt come here again Thats
owners orders Why Im expectin a boardin party any minute he
added I thought when you knocked it was papa comin for his child
Youd better go

But she stood still

I shant go she declared Or at least not until you promise to
let me try to help you If they come so much the better Theyll learn
where my sympathies are

Captain Cy scratched his head

See here Miss Phoebe he said I aint sure that you fully
understand that Scripture and everything else is against us Did Angie
turn loose on you the Whom the Lord has joined avalanche

The schoolmistress burst into a laugh The captain laughed too but
his gravity quickly returned For steps sounded on the walk there was a
whispering outside and some one knocked on the diningroom door

The situation was similar to that of the evening when the Board of
Strategy called and John Smith made his first appearance But now
oddly enough Captain Cy seemed much less troubled He looked at Miss
Dawes and there was a dancing twinkle in his eye

Is it began the lady in an agitated whisper

The boardin party I presume likely

But what can you do

Stand by the repel I guess was the calm reply I told you that they
had most of the ammunition but ours aint all blank cartridges You
stay below and listen to the broadsides

They heard Georgianna cross the dining room There was a murmur of
voices at the door The captain nodded

Its them he said Well here goes Now dont you show yourself

Do you think I am afraid Indeed I shant stay below as you call it
I shall let them see

Captain Cy held up his hand

Im commodore of this fleet he said and that bein the case I
expect my crew to obey orders Theres nothin you can do andWhy
yes there is too You can take care of Bosn Georgianna to the
housekeeper who looking frightened and nervous had appeared at the
door send Bosn in here quick

Theyre there whispered Georgianna Mr Atkins and Tad and that
Thomas critter and lots more And theyve come after her What shall we
do

Jump when I speak to you thats the first thing Send Bosn in here
and you stay in your galley

Emily came running Miss Dawes put an arm about her Captain Cy the
battle lanterns still twinkling under his brows stepped forth to meet
the boarding party

They were there as Georgianna had said Mr Thomas on the top step
Heman and Simpson on the next lower and behind them Abel Leonard and a
group of interested volunteers principally recruited from the back room
of the barber shop

Evenin gentlemen said the captain opening the door so briskly that
Mr Thomas started backward and came down heavily upon the toes of the
devoted Tad Mr Simpson swore Mr Thomas clawed about him to gain
equilibrium and the dignity of the group was seriously impaired

Evenin repeated Captain Cy Quite a surprise party youre givin
me Come in

Cyrus began the Honorable Atkins we are here to claim

Give me my daughter you robber demanded Thomas from his new
position in the rear of the other two

Mr Thomas said Heman please remember that I am conducting this
affair I respect the natural indignation of an outraged father
butahem Cyrus we are here to claim

Then do your claimin inside Its kind of chilly tonight theres
plenty of empty chairs and we dont need to hold an overflow meetin
Come ahead in

The trio looked at each other in hesitation Then Mr Atkins
majestically entered the dining room Thomas and Simpson followed him

Abe observed Captain Cy to Leonard who was advancing toward the
steps Im sorry not to be hospitable but theres too many of you to
invite at once and taint polite to show partiality You and the rest
are welcome to sit on the terrace or stroll round the deer park Good
night

He closed the door in the face of the disappointed Abel and turned to
the three in the room

Well he said out with it Youve come to claim somethin I
understand

I come for my rights shouted Mr Thomas

Yes Well this aint States prison or Id give em to you with
pleasure Heman youd better do the talkin Well probably get ahead
faster

The Honorable cleared his throat and waved his hand

Cyrus he began you are my boyhood friend and my fellow townsman and
neighbor Under such circumstances it gives me pain

Then dont let us discuss painful subjects Lets get down to business
Youve come to rescue BosnEmily that isfrom the robberIm
quotin Deacon Thomas herethats got her sos to turn her over to her
sorrowin father Is that it Yes Well you cant have hernot yet

Cyrus said Mr Atkins Im sorry to see that you take it this way
You havent the shadow of a right We have the law with us and your
conduct will lead us to invoke it The constable is outside Shall I
call him in

Uncle Bedny was the town constable and had been since before the war
The purely honorary office was given him each year as a joke Captain Cy
grinned broadly and even Tad was obliged to smile

Dont be inhuman Heman urged the captain You wouldnt turn me over
to be manhandled by Uncle Bedny would you

This is not a humorous affair began the congressman with dignity
But the bereaved father had been prospecting on his own hook and now
he peeped into the sitting room

Here she is he shouted I see her Come on Emmie Your dads come
for you Let go of her you woman What do you mean by holdin on to
her

The situation which was not humorous immediately became much less so
The next minute was a lively one It ended as Mr Thomas was picked up
by Tad from the floor where he had fallen having been pushed violently
over a chair by Captain Cy Bosn frightened and sobbing was clinging
wildly to Miss Dawes who had clung just as firmly to her The captains
voice rang through the room

Thats enough he said Thats enough and some over Atkins take
that feller out of this house and off my premises As for the girl
thats for us to fight out in the courts Im her guardian
lawfully appointed and you nor nobody else can touch her while that
appointments good Here it isright here Now look at it and clear
out

He held for the congressmans inspection the document which inclosed
in the long envelope had been received that morning His visit to
Ostable made some weeks before had been for the purpose of applying
to the probate court for the appointment as Emilys guardian He had
applied before the news of her fathers coming to life reached him The
appointment itself had arrived just in time

Mr Atkins studied the document with care When he spoke it was with
considerable agitation and without his usual diplomacy

Humph he grunted Humph I see Well sir I have some influence in
this section and I shall see how long youryour TRICK will prevent the
childs going where she belongs I wish you to understand that I shall
continue this fight to the very last II am not one to be easily
beaten Simpson you and Thomas come with me This nights despicable
chicanery is only the beginning This is bad business for you Cy
Whittaker he snarled his selfcontrol vanishing andwith a
vindictive glance at the schoolmistressfor those who are with you in
it That appointment was obtained under false pretenses and I can prove
it Your tricks dont scare me Ive had experience with TRICKS before

Yup So Ive heard Well Heman I aint as well up in tricks as you
claim to be nor my stockin isnt as well padded as yours maybe But
while theres a tencent piece left in the toe of it Ill fight you and
the skunk whose rights you seem to have taken such a shine to And
after that while theres a lawyer that ll trust me And meantime
that little girl stays right here and you touch her if you dare any of
you Anything more to say

But the Honorables dignity had returned Possibly he thought he
had said too much already A moment later the door banged behind the
discomforted boarding party

Captain Cy pulled his beard and laughed

Well we repelled em didnt we he observed But as friend
Heman says the beginnins only begun I wish he hadnt seen you here
teacher

Miss Dawes looked up from the task of stroking poor Bosns hair

I dont she said Im glad of it Then she added laughing
nervously Capn Whittaker how could you be so cool It was like a
play I declare you were just splendid



CHAPTER XIV

A CLEW


Josiah Dimick has a unique faculty of grasping a situation and summing
it up in an outoftheordinary way

I think observed Josiah to the excited group at Simmonss that this
town owes Cy Whittaker a vote of thanks

Thanks gasped Alpheus Smalley so shocked and horrified that he put
the onepound weight on the scales instead of the half pound THANKS
After what weve found out Well I must say

Yaas drawled Captain Josiah thanks was what I said If it want
for him this gang and the sewin circle wouldnt have nothin to talk
about but their neighbors Our reputations would be as full of holes as
a skimmer by this time Now all hands are so busy jumpin on Whit that
the rest of us can feel fairly safe Aint that so Gabe

Mr Lumley who had stopped in for a half pound of tea grinned feebly
but said nothing If he noticed the clerks mistake in weights he didnt
mention it but took his package and hurried out After his departure
Mr Smalley himself discovered the error and charged the Lumley account
with 1 14 lbs Mixed Green and Black Meanwhile the assemblage
about the stove had put Captain Cy on the anvil and was hammering him
vigorously

Bayport was boiling over with rumor and surmise Heman had appealed to
the courts asking that Captain Cys appointment as Bosns guardian be
rescinded Cy had hired Lawyer Peabody of Ostable to look out for his
interests Mr Atkins and the captain had all but come to blows over
the child Thomas the poor father had broken down and wept and had
threatened to commit suicide Mrs Salters had refused to speak to
Captain Cy when she met the latter after meeting on Sunday The land in
Orham had been sold and the captain was using the money Phoebe Dawes
had threatened to resign if Bosn came to school any longer No she had
threatened to resign if she didnt come to school She hadnt threatened
to resign at all but wanted higher wages because of the effect the
scandal might have on her reputation as a teacher These were a few of
the reports contradicted and added to from day to day

To quote Josiah Dimick again Sortin out the truth from the lies is
like tryin to find a quart of sardines in a schooner load of herrin
And they dump in more herrin every half hour

Angeline Phinney was having the time of her life The perfect boarding
house hummed like a fly trap Keturah and Mrs Tripp had deserted to
the enemy and the minority meaning Asaph and Bailey had little
opportunity to defend their friends cause even if they had dared
Heman Atkins his Christian charity and highmindedness his devotion to
duty regardless of political consequences and the magnificent speech
at town meeting were lauded and exalted The Bayport Breeze contained
a full account of the meeting and it was read aloud by Keturah amidst
hymns of praise from the elect

Whom the Lord hath joined read Mrs Bangs let no man put
asunder Aint that splendid Aint that FINE The paper says When
Congressman Atkins delivered this noble sentiment a hush fell upon the
excited throng I should think twould I remember when I was married
the minister said pretty nigh the same thing and I COULDNT speak I
couldnt have opened my mouth to save me Dont you remember I couldnt
Bailey

Mr Bangs nodded gloomily It is possible that he wished the effect of
the ministers declaration might have been more lasting Asaph stirred
in his chair

I dont care he said This puttin asunder business is all right
but theres always two sides to everything I see this Thomas critter
when he fust come and he didnt look like no saint thennor smell like
one neither unless twas a specimen pickled in alcohol

Here was irreverence almost atheistic Keturahs face showed her shocked
disapproval Matilda Tripp voiced the general sentiment

Humph she sniffed Well all I can say is that Ive met Mr Thomas
two or three times and _I_ didnt notice anything but politeness and
good manners Maybe my nose aint so fine for smellin liquor as some
folksspraps it aint had the experiencebut all _I_ saw was a poor
lame man with a black eye I pitied him and I dont care who hears me
say it

Yes concurred Miss Phinney and if he was a drinkin man do you
suppose Mr Atkins would have anything to do with him Cyrus Whittaker
made a whole lot of talk about his insultin some woman or other but
nobody knows who the woman was Bout time for her to speak up I should
think Teacher turning to Miss Dawes you was at the Whittaker place
when Mr Atkins and Emilys father come for her I understand I wish
Id have been there It must have been wuth seein

It was replied Miss Dawes She had kept silent throughout the various
discussions of the week following the town meeting but now thus
appealed to she answered promptly

Angelines news created a sensation The schoolmistress immediately
became the center of interest

Is that so Was you there teacher Well I declare The questions and
exclamations flew round the table

Tell us teacher pleaded Keturah Wasnt Heman grand I should so
like to have heard him Didnt Capn Whittaker look ashamed of himself

No he did not If anyone looked ashamed it was Mr Atkins and his
friends Perhaps I ought to tell you that my sympathies are entirely
with Captain Whittaker in this affair To give that little girl up to a
drunken scoundrel like her father would in my opinion be a crime

The boarders and the landlady gasped Asaph grinned and nudged Bailey
under the table Keturah was the first to recover

Well she exclaimed Everybodys got a right to their opinion of
course But I cant see the crime myself And as for the drunkenness
Id like to know whos seen Mr Thomas drunk Cyrus Whittaker SAYS he
has but

She waved her hand scornfully Phoebe rose from her chair

I have seen him in that condition she said In fact I am the person
he insulted I saw Captain Whittaker knock him down and I honored
the captain for it I only wished I were a man and could have done it
myself

She left the room and a few moments later the house Mr Tidditt
chuckled aloud Even Bailey dared to look pleased

There sneered the widow Tripp Aint thatPerhaps you remember that
Capn Whittaker got her the teachers place

Yes put in Miss Phinney and nobody knows WHY he got it for her
That is nobody has known up to now Maybe we can begin to guess a
little after this

She was at his house was she observed Keturah Humph I wonder why
Seems to me if _I_ was a youngthat is a single woman like her Id
be kind of careful about callin on bachelors Humph it looks funny to
me

Asaph rose and pushed back his chair

I callate she called to see Emily he said sharply The child was
her scholar and I presume likely knowin the kind of father that has
turned up for the poor young one she felt sorry for her Of course
nobodys hintin anything against Phoebe Dawess character If you want
a certificate of that youve only got to go to Wellmouth Folks over
there are pretty keen on that subject I guess the town would go to
law about it rathern hear a word against her Libel suits are kind of
uncomftable things for them that aint sure of their facts ID hate to
get mixed up in one myself Bailey Im going up street Come on when
you can wont you

As if frightened at his own display of spirit he hurried out There was
silence for a time then Miss Phinney spoke concerning the weather

Up at the Cy Whittaker place the days were full ones There also legal
questions were discussed with Georgianna the Board of Strategy
Josiah Dimick occasionally and more infrequently still Miss Dawes as
participants with Captain Cy in the discussions Rumors were true in
so far as they related to Mr Atkinss appeal to the courts and the
captains retaining Lawyer Peabody of Ostable Mr Peabodys opinion of
the case was not encouraging

You see captain he said when his client visited him at his office
the odds are very much against us The court appointed you as guardian
with the understanding that this man Thomas was dead Now he is alive
and claims his child More than that he has the most influential
politician in this county back of him We wouldnt stand a fighting
chance except for one thingThomas himself He left his wife and the
baby deserted them so she said went to get work HE says We can
prove he was a drunken blackguard BEFORE he went and that he has been
drunk since he came back But THEYLL sayAtkins and his lawyerthat
the man was desperate and despairing because of your refusal to give him
his child Theyll hold him up as a repentant sinner anxious to reform
and needing the little girls influence to help keep him straight
Thats their game and theyll play it be sure of that It sounds
reasonable enough too for sinners have repented before now And the
longlost father coming back to his child is the one sure thing to win
applause from the gallery you know that

Captain Cy nodded

Yup he said I know it The other night when Miss Ph when a friend
of mine was at the house she said this business was like a play I
didnt say so to her but all the same I realize it aint like a play at
all In a play dad comes home havin been snaked bodily out of the
jaws of the tomb by his coat collar and the young one sings out Papa
Papa and he sobs Me child Me child and its all lovely and
you put on your hat feelin that the old man is goin to be rich and
righteous for the rest of his days But here its different dads a
rascal and anybody whos seen anything of the world knows hes bound to
stay so and as for the poor little girl whywhy

He stopped rose and striding over to the window stood looking out
After an interval during which the goodnatured attorney read a dull
business letter through for the second time he spoke again

I hope you understand Peabody he said It aint just selfishness
that makes me steer the course Im runnin Course Bosns got to be
the world and all to me and if shes taken away I dont knows I care a
tinkers darn what happens afterwards But all the same if her dad was
a real man sorry for what hes done and tryin to make up for itwhy
then I callate Im decent enough to take off my hat hand her over
and say God bless you and good luck But to think of him carryin her
off the Lord knows where to neglect her and cruelize her and to let
her grow up among fellers like him IIby the big dipper I cant do
it Thats all I cant

How does she feel about it herself asked Peabody

Her Bosn Why thats the hardest of all Some of the children at
school pester her about her father I dont knows you can blame em
young ones are made that way I guessbut she comes home to me cryin
and its O Uncle Cy he AINT my truly father is he and You wont
let him take me away from you will you till it seems as if I should
fly out of the window The poor little thing And that puffedup humbug
Atkins blowin about his Christianity and all Dn such Christianity as
that I say Ive seen heathen Injuns who never heard of Christ
with more of His spirit inside em There Ive shocked you I guess
Sometimes I think this place is too narrer and cramped for me Ive been
around you know and my New England bringin up has wore thin in spots
Seems if I must get somewheres and spread out or Ill bust

He threw himself into a chair The lawyer clapped him on the shoulder

There there captain he said Dont bust yet awhile Dont give
up the ship If we lose in one court we can appeal to another and so
on up the line And meantime well do a little investigating of
friend Thomass career since he left Concord Ive written to a legal
acquaintance of mine in Butte giving him the facts as we know them and
a description of Thomas He will try to find out what the fellow did in
his years out West Its our best chance as I told you Keep your pluck
up and wait and see

The captain repeated this conversation to the Board of Strategy when he
returned to Bayport Miss Dawes had walked home from school with Bosn
and had stopped at the house to hear the report She listened but it
was evident that something else was on her mind

Captain Whittaker she asked has it ever struck you as queer that
Mr Atkins should take such an interest in this matter He is giving
time and counsel and money to help this man Thomas who is a perfect
stranger to him Why does he do it

Captain Cy smiled

Why he repeated Why to down me of course I was gettin too
everlastin prominent in politics to suit him Id got you in as
teacher and I had Lonzo Snow as good as licked for school committee
Goodness knows what I might have run for next cordin to Hemans
reasonin and I simply had to be smashed It worked all right Im so
unhealthy now in the sight of most folks in this town that I callate
they go home and sulphursmoke their clothes after they meet me sos
not to catch my wickedness

But the teacher shook her head

That doesnt seem reason enough to me she declared Just see what
Mr Atkins has done He never openly advocated anything in town meeting
before you said so yourself Even when he must have realized that you
had the votes for committeeman he kept still He might have taken many
of them from you by simply coming out and declaring for Mr Snow but he
didnt And then all at once he takes this astonishing stand Captain
Whittaker Mr Tidditt says that the night of Emilys birthday party
you and he told who she was by accident and that Mr Atkins seemed
very much surprised and upset Is that so

Captain Cy laughed

His lemonade was upset thats all I noticed special Oh yes and he
lost his hat off goin home But what of it What are you drivin at

I was wondering ifif it could be that for some reason Mr Atkins
had a spite against Emily or her people Or if he had any reason to fear
her

Fear Fear Bosn Oh my thats funny Youve been readin novels Im
fraid teacher though I didnt suspect it of you

He laughed heartily Miss Dawes smiled too but she still persisted

Well she said I dont know Perhaps it is because Im a woman and
politics dont mean as much to me as to you men but to me political
reasons dont seem strong enough to account for such actions as those
of Mr Atkins Emilys mother was a Thayer wasnt she and the Thayers
once lived in Orham I wish we could find out more about them while they
lived there

Asaph Tidditt pulled his beard thoughtfully

Well he observed maybe we can if we want to though I dont think
what we find out ll amount to nothin I was kind of callatin to go
to Orham next week on a little visit Seth Wingate over thereBarzilla
Wingates cousin Whitis a sort of relation of mine and we visit back
and forth every nine or ten year or so The ten years most up and hes
been pesterin me to come over Seths been Orham town clerk about as
long as Ive been the Bayport one and hes lived there all his life
What he dont know about Orham folks aint wuth knowin If you say so
Ill pump him about the Thayers and the Richards Twont do no harm
and the old fool likes to talk anyhow I dont knows I ought to speak
that way about my relations he added doubtfully but Seth IS sort of
stubborn and unlikely at odd times We dont always agree as to which is
the best town to live in you understand

So it was settled that Mr Wingate should be subjected to the pumping
process when Asaph visited him He departed for this visit the following
week and remained away for ten days Meanwhile several things happened
in Bayport

One of these things was the farewell of the Honorable Heman Atkins
Congress was to open at Washington and the Honorable heeded the call
of duty Alicia and the housekeeper went with him and the big house was
closed for the winter At the gate between the stone urns and backed
by the iron dogs the great man bade a group of admiring constituents
goodby He thanked them for their trust in him and promised that it
should not be betrayed

I leave you my fellow townsmen erladies and friends he said
with regret tempered by pridea not inexcusable pride I believe In
the trying experience which my selfrespect and sympathy has so recently
forced upon me you have stood firm and cheered me on The task I have
undertaken the task of restoring to a worthy man his own shall be
carried on to the bitterest extremity I have put my hand to the plow
and it shall not be withdrawn And furthermore I go to my work at
Washington determined to secure for my native town the appropriation
which it so sorely needs I shall secure it if I can even though and
the sarcasm was hugely enjoyed by his listenersI am as I seem likely
to be deprived of the help of the committee selfappointed at our
recent town meeting If I failand I do not conceal the fact that I
may failI am certain you will not blame me Now I should like to shake
each one of you by the hand

The hands were shaken and the train bore the Atkins delegation away
And on the day following Mr Thomas the prodigal father also left
town A position in Boston had been offered him he said and he felt
that he must accept it He would come back some of these days with the
warrant from the court and get his little girl

Position offered him Umyaas quoth Dimick the cynical in
conversation with Captain Cy Inspector of sidewalks I shouldnt
wonder Well please dont ask me if I think Heman sent him to Boston
sos to have him out of the way and cause hed feel considerble safer
than if he was loose down here Dont ask me that for with my strict
scruples against the truth I might say No As it is I say nothinand
wink my port eye

The tenday visit ended Mr Tidditt returned to Bayport On the
afternoon of his return he and Bailey called at the Whittaker place
and there they were joined by Miss Dawes who had been summoned to the
conclave by a note intrusted to Bosn

Now Ase ordered Captain Cy as the quartet gathered in the sitting
room here we are hangin on your words as the feller said Dont
keep us strung up too long What did you find out

The town clerk cleared his throat When he spoke there was a trace of
disappointment in his tone To have been able to electrify his audience
with the news of some startling discovery would have been pure joy for
Asaph

Well he began I dont knows I found out anything much Yet I did
find out somethin too but it dont really amount to nothin I hoped
twould be somethin moren twas but when nothin come of it except
the little somethin it begun with I

For the land sakes snapped Bailey Bangs who was a trifle envious of
his friends position in the center of the stage stop them nothins
and somethins wont you You keep whirlin em round and over and
over till my heads FULL of nothin and

Thats what its full of most of the time interrupted Asaph tartly
Captain Cy hastened to act as peacemaker

Never mind Bailey he said you let Ase alone Tell us what you did
find out Ase and cut out the trimmins

Well continued Mr Tidditt with a glare at Bangs I asked Seth
about the Thayers and the Richards folks the very fust night I struck
Orham He remembered em of course he can remember Adam if you let
him tell it He told me a whole mess about old man Thayer and old man
Richards and their granddads and grandmarms and what houses they lived
in and how many hens they kept and what their dogs name was and how
they come to name him that and enough more to fill a hogshead Twas
ten oclock afore he got out of Genesis and down so fur as John and
Emily He remembered their bein married and their babyMary Thayer
Bosns mabein born

Folks used to call John Thayer a smart young feller so Seth said They
used to callate that hed rise high in the seafarin and shipownin
line Maybe he would only he died somewheres in Californy long in 54
or thereabouts Twas the time of the gold craziness out there and he
left his ship and went gold huntin And the next thing they knew he was
dead and buried

When was that inquired the schoolmistress

In 54 I tell you So Seth says

What ship was he on asked Bailey

Want on any ship Why dont you listen instead of settin there
moonin He was gold diggin I tell you

Hed BEEN on a ship hadnt he What was the name of her

I didnt ask What diffrence does that make

Wasnt Mr Atkins at sea in those days put in the teacher The
captain answered her

Yes he was he said That is I think he was He was away from here
when I skipped out and he didnt get back till 61 or thereabouts

Well anyhow went on Asaph thats all I could find out Seth and me
went rummagin through town records from way back to glory him gassin
away and stringin along about this old settler and that till I most
wished hed choke himself with the dust he was raisin We found Johns
grandads will and Emilys dads will and Johns own will and thats
all John left everything he had and all he might become possessed of
to his wife and baby and their heirs forever He died poorern poverty
Whats the use of a will when you aint got nothin to leave

Why exclaimed Captain Cy The answer to thats easy John was goin
to sea and moren likely intended to have a shy at the diggins afore
he got back So if he did make any money he wanted his wife and baby
to have it

Well what they got want wuth havin Emily had to scrimp along and
do dressmakin till she died She done fairly well at that though
and saved somethin and passed it over to Mary And Mary married Henry
Thomas after she went with the Howes tribe to Concord and he got rid
of it for her in double quick timeall but the Orham land

So that was all you could find out hey Ase asked the captain
Well its at least as much as I expected You see teacher these
storybook notions dont work out when it comes to real life

Miss Dawes was plainly disappointed

I wish we knew more she said Who was on this ship with Mr Thayer
And who sent the news of his death home

Oh I can tell you that said Asaph Twas some onehoss doctor out
there gold minin himself he was John died of a quick fever Got cold
and went off in no time Seth remembered that much though he couldnt
remember the doctors name He said if I wanted to learn more about
the Thayers I might go seeHumph well never mind that Twas just
foolishness anyhow

But Phoebe persisted

To see whom she asked Some one you knew A friend of yours

Asaph turned red

Friend of mine he snarled No SIR she aint no friend of mine Im
thankful to say More a friend of Baileys here if shes anybodys
One of his pets she was for a spell A patient of his you might say
anyhow he prescribed for her Twas that deef idiot Debby Beasley Cy
thats who twas Her name was Briggs afore she married Beasley and
she was hired help for Emily Thayer when Mary was born and until John
died

Captain Cy burst into a roar of laughter Bailey sprang out of his
chair

DeDebby Beasley he stammered Debby Beasley

She was that deef housekeeper Bailey hired for me teacher explained
the captain Ive told you about her Ho ho so thats the end of
the mystery huntin We go gunnin for Heman Atkins and we bring down
Debby Well Ase goin to see the old lady

Mr Tidditts retort was emphatic

Goin to SEE her he repeated I guess not Godfrey scissors I told
Seth says I Ive had all the Debby Beasley _I_ want and I callate
Cy Whittaker feels the same way Go to see her I wouldnt go to see
her if she was up in Paradise ahollerin for me

Nobody up theres goin to holler for YOU Ase Tidditt remarked
Bailey with sarcasm so dont let that worry you none

Are YOU going to see her Captain Whittaker asked Phoebe

The captain shook his head

Why no I guess not he said I dont take much stock in what shed
be likely to know besides Im a good deal like AseIve had about all
the Debby Beasley I want



CHAPTER XV

DEBBY BEASLEY TO THE RESCUE


Mrs Bangs said the schoolmistress as if it was the most casual
thing in the world I want to borrow your husband tomorrow

It was Friday evening and supper at the perfect boarding house had
advanced as far as the stewed prunes and fruitcake stage Keturah
who was carefully dealing out the prunes exactly four to each saucer
stopped short spoon in air and gazed at Miss Dawes

Youyou want to WHAT she asked

I want to borrow your husband I want him all day too because Im
thinking of driving over to Trumet and I need a coachman Youll go
wont you Mr Bangs

Bailey who had been considering the advisability of asking for a second
cup of tea brightened up and looked pleased

Why yes he answered Ill go I can go just as well as not Fact
is Id like to Aint been to Trumet I dont know when

Miss Phinney and the widow Tripp looked at each other Then they both
looked at Keturah That ladys mouth closed tightly and she resumed her
prune distribution

Im sorry she said crisply but Im fraid he cant go Its
Saturday and Ill need him round the house Do you care for cake
tonight Elviry Im fraid its pretty dry I aint had time to do
much bakin this week

Of course continued the smiling Phoebe I shouldnt think of asking
him to go for nothing I didnt mean borrow him in just that way I
was thinking of hiring your horse and buggy and as Im not used to
driving I thought perhaps I might engage Mr Bangs to drive for me
I expected to pay for the privilege But as you need him I suppose I
must get my rig and driver somewhere else Im so sorry

The landladys expression changed This was the dull season and
opportunities to let the family steed and buggyhorse and team we
call it in Bayportwere few

Well she observed I dont want to be unlikely and disobligin
Fars hes concerned hed rather be traipsin round the country than
stay to home any day though its been so long sence he took ME to ride
that I dont knows Id know how to act

Why Ketury protested her husband How you talk Didnt I drive you
down to the graveyard only last Sundayor the Sunday afore

Graveyard Yes I notice our rides always fetch up at the graveyard
Youre always willin to take me THERE Seems sometimes as if you
enjoyed doin it

Now Keturah you know yourself that twas you proposed goin there
You said you wanted to look at our lot cause you was afraid twant
big enough and you didnt know but wed ought to add on another piece
You said that it kept you awake nights worryin for fear when I passed
away you wouldnt have room in that lot for me Land sakes dont I
remember Didnt you give me the blue creeps talkin about it

Mrs Bangs ignored this outburst Turning to the school teacher she
said with a sigh

Well I guess he can go Ill get along somehow I hope hell be
careful of the buggy we had it painted only last January

Mrs Tripp ventured a hinted question concerning the teachers errand
at Trumet The reply being noncommittal the widow cheerfully prophesied
that she guessed twas going to rain or snow next day Its about time
for the line storm she added

But it did not storm although a brisk cold gale was blowing when
after breakfast next morning the horse and team with Bailey in his
Sunday suit and overcoat and Miss Dawes on the buggy seat beside him
turned out of the boardinghouse yard and started on the twelvemile
journey to Trumet

It was a bleak ride Denboro the village adjoining Bayport on the bay
side is a pretty place with old elms and silverleafs shading the main
street in summer and with substantial houses set each in its trim yard
But beyond Denboro the Trumet road winds out over rolling bare hills
with cranberry bogs now flooded and skimmed with ice in the hollows
between them clumps of bayberry and beachplum bushes scattered over
their rounded slopes and white scars in their sides showing where the
cranberry growers have cut away the thin layer of coarse grass and moss
to reach the sand beneath sand which they use in preparing their bogs
for the new vines

And the wind There is always a breeze along the Trumet road even
in summerwhen the mosquitoes lie in wait to leeward like buccaneers
until sighting the luckless wayfarer in the offing they drive down
before the wind in clouds literally to eat him alive They are skilled
navigators those Trumet road mosquitoes and they know the advantage
of snug harbors under hat brims and behind spreading ears And each
individual smashed by a frantic palm leaves a thousand blood relatives
to attend his funeral and exact revenge after the Corsican fashion

Now in December there were of course no mosquitoes but the wind
tore across those bare hilltops in gusts that rocked the buggy on its
springs The bayberry bushes huddled and crouched before it The sky was
covered with tumbling flying clouds which changed shape continually
and ripped into long fleecy ravelings that broke loose and pelted on
until merged into the next billowy mass The bay was gray and white and
in the spots where an occasional sunbeam broke through and struck it
flashed like a turned knife blade

Bailey drove with one hand and held his hat on his head with the other
The road had been deeply rutted during the November rains and now the
ruts were frozen The buggy wheels twisted and scraped as they turned in
the furrows

Whats the matter asked the schoolmistress shouting so as to be
heard above the flapping of the buggy curtains Why do you watch that
wheel

Fraid of the axle whooped Mr Bangs in reply Nuts kind of loose
for one thing and the way the wheel wobbles Im scart shell come off
Call this a road he snorted indignantly More like a plowed field a
considerble sight Jerushy how she blows No wonder they raise so many
deef and dumb folks in Trumet Id talk sign language myself if I lived
here Whats the use of wastin strength pumpin up words when theyre
blowed back down your throat fast enough to choke you Git dap Henry
Dont you see the meetin house steeple Were most there thank the
goodness

In Trumet Center which is not much of a center Miss Dawes alighted
from the buggy and entered a building bearing a sign with the words
Metropolitan Variety Store Joshua Atwood Propr Groceries Coal Dry
Goods Insurance Boots and Shoes Garden Seeds etc A smaller sign
beneath this was lettered Justice of the Peace and one below that
read Post Office

She emerged a moment later followed by an elderly person in a red
cardigan jacket and overalls

Take the fust turnin to the left marm he said pointing Its
pretty nigh to East Trumet townhall Fust house this side of the
blacksmith shop About two mile Id say Windy day for drivin aint
it That horse of yours belongs in Bayport I callate Looks to me
likeHello Bailey

Hello Josh grunted Mr Bangs adding an explanatory aside to
the effect that he knew Josh Atwood the latter having once lived in
Bayport

But say he asked as they moved on once more have we got to go to
EAST Trumet Jerushy thats the place where the wind COMES from They
raise it over there anyhow they dont raise much else Whose house you
goin to

He had asked the same question at least ten times since leaving home
and each time Miss Dawes had evaded it She did so now saying that she
was sure she should know the house when they got to it

The two miles to East Trumet were worse than the twelve which they had
come The wind fairly shrieked here for the road paralleled the edge of
high sand bluffs close by the shore and the ruts and thankyoumarms
were trying to the temper Baileys was completely wrecked

Teacher he snapped as they reached the crest of a long hill and
a quick grab at his hat alone prevented its starting on a balloon
ascension get out a spell will you Ive got to swear or bust and
longs youre aboard I cant swear What you standin still for
you he bellowed at poor Henry the horse who had stopped to rest I
callate the critter thinks that last cyclone must have blowed me sky
high and hes waitin to see where I light Git dap

I guess I shall get out very soon now panted Phoebe Theres the
blacksmith shop over there near the next hill and this house in the
hollow must be the one Im looking for

They pulled up beside the house in the hollow A little
storyandahalf house it was and judging by the neglected appearance
of the weeds and bushes in the yard it had been unoccupied for some
time However the blinds were now open and a few fowls about the back
door seemed to promise that some one was living there The wooden letter
box by the gate had a name stenciled upon it Miss Dawes sprang from the
buggy and looked at the box

Yes she said This is the place Will you come in Mr Bangs You
can put your horse in that barn Im sure if you want to

But Bailey declined to come in He declared he was going on to the
blacksmiths shop to have that wheel fixed He would not feel safe to
start for home with it as it was He drove off and Miss Dawes knowing
from lifelong experience that front doors are merely for show passed
around the main body of the house and rapped on the door in the ell
The rap was not answered though she could hear some one moving about
within and a shrill voice singing The Sweet By and By So she rapped
again and again but still no one came to the door At last she ventured
to open it

A thin woman with her head tied up in a colored cotton handkerchief
was in the room vigorously wielding a broom She was singing in a high
cracked voice The opening of the door let in a gust of cold wind which
struck the singer in the back of the neck and caused her to turn around
hastily

Hey she exclaimed Land sakes you scare a body to death Shut that
door quick I aint hankering for influenzy Who are you What do you
want Why didnt you knock Wheres my specs

She took a pair of spectacles from the mantel shelf rubbed them
with her apron and set them on the bridge of her thin nose Then she
inspected the schoolmistress from head to foot

I beg pardon for coming in shouted Phoebe I knocked but you didnt
hear You are Mrs Beasley arent you

I dont want none replied Debby with emphasis So theres no use
your wastin your breath

Dont want repeated the astonished teacher Dont want what

Hey I say I dont want none

Dont want WHAT

Whatever tis youre peddlin Books or soap or tea or whatever tis
I dont want nothin

After some strenuous minutes the visitor managed to make it clear to
Mrs Beasleys mind that she was not a peddler She tried to add a word
of further explanation but it was effort wasted

Taint no use snapped Debby I cant hear you you speak so faint
Wait till I get my horn its in the settin room

Phoebes wonder as to what the horn might be was relieved by the
widows appearance a moment later with the biggest ear trumpet her
caller had ever seen

There now she said adjusting the instrument and thrusting the
bellshaped end under the teachers nose Talk into that If you aint
a peddler what be yousewin machine agent

Phoebe explained that she had come some distance on purpose to see Mrs
Beasley She was interested in the Thayers who used to live in Orham
particularly in Mr John Thayer who died in 1854 She had been told
that Debby formerly lived with the Thayers and could no doubt
remember a great deal about them Would she mind answering a few
questions and so on

Mrs Beasley her hearing now within fortyfive degrees of the normal
grew interested She ushered her visitor into the adjoining room and
proffered her a chair That sitting room was a wonder of its kind even
to the teachers accustomed eyes A giltframed crayon enlargement of
the late Mr Beasley hung in the center of the broadest wall space and
was not the ugliest thing in the apartment Having said this further
description is unnecessaryparticularly to those who remember Mr
Beasleys personal appearance

What you so interested in the Thayers for inquired Debby One of the
heirs be you They didnt leave nothin

No the schoolmistress was not an heir Was not even a relative of the
family But she waswas interested just the same A friend of hers was
a relative and

What is your friend inquired the inquisitor A man

There was no reason why Miss Dawes should have changed color but
according to Debbys subsequent testimony she did she blushed so the
widow declares

No she protested Oh no its ashes a child thats alla
little girl But

Maybe youre gettin up one of them geographical trees suggested Mrs
Beasley Ive seen em fust settlers down in the trunk and children
and grandchildren spreadin out in the branches Is that it

Here was an avenue of escape Phoebe stretched the truth a trifle and
admitted that that or something of the sort was what she was engaged
in The explanation seemed to be satisfactory Debby asked her
visitors name and misunderstanding it addressed her as Miss Dorcas
thereafter Then she proceeded to give her reminiscences of the Thayers
and it did not take long for the disappointed teacher to discover that
for all practical purposes these reminiscences were valueless Mrs
Beasley remembered many things but nothing at all concerning John
Thayers life in the West nor the name of the ship he sailed in nor
who his shipmates were

He never wrote home but once or twice afore he died she said And
when he did Emily his wife never told me what was in his letters She
always burnt em I guess I used to hunt around for em when she was
out but she burnt em to spite me I callate Her and me didnt get
along any too well She said I talked too much to other folks about what
was none of their business Now anybody that knows me knows THAT aint
one of my failins I told her so says I

And so on for ten minutes Then Phoebe ventured to repeat the words out
West and her companion went off on a new tack She had just been West
herself She had been on a visit to her husbands niece who lived in
Arizona In Blazeton Arizona Its the nicest town ever you see she
continued And the smartest most uptodate place Talk about the West
bein oncivilized My land you ought to see that town Electric
lights and telephones andandI dont know what all Why Miss
WhatsyournameMiss Dorcas marm you just ought to see the
photygraphs Ive got that was took out there My niece she took em
with one of them little mites of cameras You wouldnt believe such a
little box of a thing could take such photygraphs Im goin to get em
and show em to you No sir you aint got to go neither Set right
still and let me fetch them photygraphs Twont be a mite of trouble
Id love to do it

Protests were unavailing The photographs at least fifty of them were
produced and the suffering caller was shown the Blazeton City Hall and
the Blazeton Palace Hotel and the home of the Beasley niece taken
from the front the rear and both sides With each specimen Debby
delivered a descriptive lecture

You see that house she asked Well taint much of a one to look
at but its got the most interestin story tagged on to it I made Eva
thats my niece take a picture of it just on that account The woman
that lives theres had the hardest time Her fust names Desire and
that kind of made me take an interest in her right off cause I had an
Aunt Desire once and its a name you dont hear very often Afterwards
I got to know her real well She was a widder woman like me only she
didnt have as much sense as Ive got and went and married a second
time Twas long in 1886 she done it This man Higgins he went to
work for her on her place and pretty soon he married her They lived
together principally on her fust husbands insurance money I callate
until a year or so ago Then the insurance money give out and Mr
Higgins he says Old woman he saysID never let a husband of mine
call me old woman but Desire didnt seem to mindOld woman he
says Im goin over to Phoenixthats another city in Arizonato
look for a job And he went and she aint heard hideI mean seen hide
nor heard hairWhat DOES ail me She aint seen nor heard of him since
And she advertised in the weekly paper and I dont know what all She
thinks he was murdered you know thats what makes it so sort of creepy
and interestin Everybody was awful kind to her and we got to be real
good friends Why I

This was but the beginning It was evident that Mrs Beasley had
thoroughly enjoyed herself in Blazeton and that the sorrows of the
bereaved Desire Higgins had been one of the principal sources of that
enjoyment The schoolmistress endeavored to turn the subject but it was
useless

I fetched home a whole pile of them newspapers continued Debby
They was awful interestin full of pictures of Blazeton buildins
and leadin folks and all And in some of the back numbers was the
advertisement about Mr Higgins I do wish I could show em to you but
I lent em to Mrs Atwood up to the Center If twant such a ways Id
go and fetch em Mrs Atwoods been awful nice to me She took care of
my trunks and things when I went Westyes and afore that when I went
to Bayport to keep house for that miserble Capn Whittaker I aint
told you about that but I will by and by Them trunks had lots of
things in em that I didnt want to lose nor have anybody see My
diariesIve kept a diary since 1850and

Diaries interrupted Phoebe grasping at straws Did you keep a diary
while you were at the Thayers

Yes Now why didnt I think of that afore Moren likely thered be
somethin in that to help you with that geographical tree I used to put
down everything that happened andWhere you goin

Miss Dawes had risen and was peering out of the window

I was looking to see if my driver was anywhere about she replied I
thought perhaps he would drive over to Mrs Atwoods and get the diary
for you But I dont see him

Just then from around the corner of the house peeped an agitated face
an agitated forefinger beckoned Debby stepped to the window beside her
visitor and the face and finger went out of sight as if pulled by a
string

Miss Phoebe smiled

I think Ill go out and look for him she said He must be near here
Ill be right back Mrs Beasley

Without stopping to put on her jacket she hurried through the dining
room out of the door and around the corner There she found Mr Bangs
in a highly nervous state

Why didnt you tell me twas Debby Beasley you was comin to see he
demanded If youd mentioned that deef images name youd never got ME
to drive you I tell you that

Yes answered the teacher sweetly I imagined that Thats why I
didnt tell you Mr Bangs Now I want you to do me a favor Will you
drive over to Trumet Center and deliver a note and get a package for
me Then you can come back here and I shall be ready to start for
home

Drive Drive nothin The blacksmiths out and wont be back for
another hour His boys there but hes a big enough lunkhead to try
bailin out a dory with a fork and that buggy axle is bent so its
simply got to be fixed Id no more go home to Ketury with that buggy as
tis than IdOh my land of love

The ejaculation was almost a groan There at the corner ear trumpet
adjusted and spectacles glistening stood Debby Beasley Bailey
appeared to wilt under her gaze as if the spectacles were twin suns
Miss Dawes looked as if she very much wanted to laugh The widow stared
in silence

Howhow dye do Mrs Beasley faltered Mr Bangs not forgetting to
raise his voice I hope youre lookin as well as you feel I mean I
hope youre smart

Mrs Beasley nodded decisively

Yes she answered Im pretty tolerble thank you What was the
matter Mr Bangs Why didnt you come in Do you usually make your
calls round the corner

The gentleman addressed seemed unable to reply The schoolmistress came
to the rescue

You mustnt blame Mr Bangs Mrs Beasley she explained He
wasnt responsible for what happened at Captain Whittakers He is
the gentleman who drove me over here I was going to send him to Mrs
Atwoods for the diary

Who said I was blamin him queried the widow If twas that little
Tidditt thing I might feel different But considerin that I got this
horn from Mr Bangs Im willin to let bygones be past It helps my
hearin a lot Them earfixins was good while they lasted but they got
out of kilter quick _I_ shant bother Mr Bangs If he can square his
own conscience Im satisfied

Baileys conscience was not troubling him greatly and he seemed
relieved Phoebe told of the damaged buggy

Humph grunted the widow The horse didnt get bent too did he

Mr Bangs indignantly declared that the horse was all right

Umhum Well then I guess I can supply a carriage My fust cousin
Ezra that died used to be doctor here and he give me his sulky when he
got a new one Its out in the barn Go fetch your horse and harness
him in Ill be ready time the harnessins done

You gasped the teacher You dont need to go Mrs Beasley I
wouldnt think of giving you that trouble

No trouble at all I wouldnt trust nobody else with them trunks And
besides I always do enjoy ridin You could go too Miss Dorcas but
the sulky seats too narrer for three You can set in the settin room
till we get back Twont take us long Dont say another word Im
AGOIN



CHAPTER XVI

A REMARKABLE DRIVE AND WHAT FOLLOWED


The number of reasons given by Mr Bangs one after the other to
prove that it would be quite impossible for him to be Mrs Beasleys
charioteer was a credit to the resources of his invention The
blacksmith might be back any minute it was dinner time and he was
hungry Henry the horse was tired it wasnt a nice day for riding
and he would come over some other time and take the widow out heBut
Debby had a conclusive answer for each protest

You said yourself the blacksmith wouldnt be back for an hour she
observed And you can leave word with the boy what hes to do when he
does come As for dinner Ill be real glad to give you and Miss Dorcas
a snack soons we get back I dont mind if it aint a pleasant day a
little fresh air ll do me good I been shut up here housecleanin ever
since I got back from out West Now hurry right along and fetch your
horse Ill unlock the barn

But Mrs Beasley put in the schoolmistress why couldnt you give
us a note to Mrs Atwood and let us stop for the diary on our way home
I could return it to you by mail Or you might get it yourself some
other day and mail it to me

No no Never put off till tomorrer what you can do today My husband
was a great hand to put off and put off For the last eight years of his
life I was at him to buy a new gotomeetin suit of clothes The one
he had was blue to start with but it faded to a brown and toward the
last of it I declare if it didnt commence to turn green Nothin I
could say would make him heave it away even then Seemed to think more
of it than ever Said he wanted to hang to it a spell and see what
twould turn next But he died and was laid out in that same suit and
I was so mortified at the funeral I couldnt think of nothin else No
Ill go after them papers and the diary while theyre fresh in my mind
And besides do you spose Id let Sarah Ann Atwood rummage through my
trunks I guess not

Phoebe began to be sorry she had thought of sending for the diary
particularly as the chance of its containing valuable information was
so remote Mrs Beasley went into the house to dress for the ride The
schoolmistress went with her as far as the sitting room The perturbed
Bailey stalked off muttering to the blacksmiths

In a little while he returned leading Henry by the bridle Debby
adorned with the beflowered bonnet she had worn when she arrived at the
Cy Whittaker place and with a black cloth cape over her lean shoulders
was waiting for him by the open door of the barn The cape had a fur
collarcat fur so Mr Bangs said afterwards in describing it

Pull the sulky right out commanded the widow

Bailey stared into the black interior of the barn

Which is it he shouted

Mrs Beasley pointed with her ear trumpet

Why that one there of course Tothers a truck cart You wouldnt
expect me to ride in that would you

Mr Bangs entered the barn seized the vehicle indicated by the shafts
and drew it out into the yard He inspected it deliberately and
then sat weakly down on the chopping block near by Apparently he was
overcome by emotion

The sulky bequeathed by the late doctor had been built to order for
its former owner It was of the carryall variety except that it had
but a single narrow seat Its top was square and was curtained the
curtains being tightly buttoned down Altogether it was something of a
curiosity Miss Dawes who had come out to see the start looked at the
sulky then at Mr Bangss face and turned her back Her shoulders
shook

It used to be a real nice carriage when Ezra had it commented the
widow admiringly It needs ilin and sprucin up now but I guess
twill do Come to Bailey who had not risen from the chopping block
Hurry up and harness or well never get started Thought you wanted to
get back for dinner

Mr Bangs stood up and heaved a sigh

I did he answered slowly but with a glance at the sulky
somethin seems to have took away my appetite Teacher do you mean
to

But Miss Dawes had withdrawn to the corner of the house from which
viewpoint she seemed to be inspecting the surrounding landscape Bailey
seized Henry by the bridle and backed him into the shafts

Back up he roared Back up I tell you You neednt look at me that
way he added in a lower tone _I_ cant help it You aint any worse
ashamed than I am There the arks off the ways All aboard

Turning to the expectant widow he boosted her not too tenderly up
to the narrow seat Then he climbed in himself Two on that seat made
a tight fit Bailey took up the reins Debby leaned forward and peered
around the edge of the curtains

You she shouted You Miss WhatsyournameDorcas Come here a
minute I want to tell you somethin

The schoolmistress her face red and her eyes moist approached

I just wanted to say explained Debby that I aint real sure as that
diarys there I burnt up a lot of my old letters and things a spell
ago and seems to me I burnt some old diaries too but maybe that want
one of em Anyhow I can get them Arizona papers and I do want you to
see em Theyre the most INTERESTIN things Now she added turning
to her companion on the seat you can git dap just as soon as you want
to

Whether or not Mr Bangs wanted to git dap is a doubtful question But
at all events he did Before the astonished Miss Dawes could think of an
answer to the observation concerning the diary the carriage its
long unused axles shrieking protests moved out of the yard The
schoolmistress watched it go Then she returned to the sitting room and
collapsed in a rocking chair

Once out from the shelter of the house and on the open road the sulky
received the full force of the wind The first gust that howled in from
the bay struck its curtained side with a sudden burst of power that
caused Mrs Beasley to clutch her drivers arm

Good land of mercy she screamed It blows real hard dont it

Mr Bangss answer was in the form of delicate sarcasm bellowed into
the ear trumpet

Sho he exclaimed I want to know You dont say Now you mention it
seems as if I had noticed a little air stirrin

Another gust tilted the carriage top Debby clutched the arm still
tighter

Why it blows awful hard she cried Id no idee it blew like this

Want to bout ship and go home again whooped Bailey hopefully But
the widow didnt intend to give up the rare luxury of a ride which a
kind Providence had cast in her way

No no she answered I guess if you folks come all the way from
Bayport I can stand it as furs the Center But hurry all you can wont
you Im kind of fraid of the springs

Springs What springs Let go my arm will you Its goin to sleep

Mrs Beasley let go of the arm momentarily

I mean the springs on this carriage she explained Last time I lent
it to anybodySolon Davis twashe said the bolts underneath was
pretty nigh rusted out and about all that held the wagon part on was
its own weight So well have to be kind of careful

WellIswantoMAN was Mr Bangss sole comment on the amazing
disclosure however as an expression of concentrated and profound
disgust it was quite sufficient He spoke but once during the remainder
of the trip to the Center Then when his passenger begged to know
if that Whittaker man had been well since she left he shouted
YesEVER since and relapsed into his former gloomy silence

The widows stop at the Atwood house which was in the immediate rear of
the Atwood store was of a half hours duration Bailey refused to
leave the seat of the sulky and sat there speaking to no one not even
replying to the questions of a group of loungers who gathered to inspect
the ancient vehicle and professed to be in doubt as to whether it had
been washed in with the tide or been left to him in a will

At last Debby made her appearance her arms filled with newspapers The
latter she piled under the carriage seat and then climbed to her former
place beside the driver Henry in response to a slap from the reins
got under way once more The axles squeaked and screamed

Gee cried one youngster from the steps of the store Its the steam
calliope Whens the rest of the show comin

Hi yelled another See how close theyre hugged up together Aint
they lovin Its a weddin

Shut up roared the tortured Bailey whose hat had blown back into the
body of the sulky leaving his bald head exposed to the cutting wind

The audience begged him to give them a lock of his hair and added other
remarks of a personal nature concerning the youth and beauty of the
bridal couple and their chariot Mr Bangs was in a state of dumb
frenzy Debby who without her trumpet had heard nothing of all this
was smiling and garrulous

I found all the papers she said Theyre right under the seat Im
goin to look em over sos to have the interestin parts all ready to
show Miss Dorcas when we get home Aint it nice I found em

In spite of her drivers remonstrances unheard because of the
nonadjustment of the trumpet she reached under the seat and brought out
the pile of Blazeton weeklies With her feet upon the pile to keep
it from blowing away she proceeded to unfold one of the papers It
crackled and snapped in the wind like a loose mainsail

Keep that dratted thing out of my face wont you shrieked the
agonized Bailey Howm I goin to see to steer with that smackin me
between the eyes every other second

Hey Did you speak to me asked the widow sweetly

Did I SPEAK No I screeched What in tunket

I want you to see this picture of the mayors house in Blazeton Eva
my husbands niece lives right acrost the road from him Manys the
time Ive set on their piazza and seen him come out and go to the City
Hall

Keep it out of my face I tell you Reef it Furl it youyou woman I
wish to thunder the piazza had caved in on you I never see such an old
fool in my born days TAKE IT AWAY

Mrs Beasley removed the paper but only to substitute another

Heres Evas brotherinlaw she screamed Hes one of the prominent
business men out there so they put him in the paper Aint he nice
lookin

Baileys comments on the prominent business mans appearance were
anything but flattering Debby continued to reach for more papers
carefully replacing those she had inspected in the pile beneath her
feet The wind blew as hard as ever even harder for it was now almost
dead ahead Henry plodded along They were in the hollow at the foot of
the last long hill that from which the blacksmith shop had first been
sighted

I know what Ill do declared the passenger Ill hunt for that
missin husband advertisement of Desire Higginss Lets see now Twill
be down at the bottom of the pile cause the paper its in is a last
year one

She bobbed down behind the high dashboard Mr Bangs stood up in order
that her gymnastics might interfere to a lesser degree with his
driving The equipage began to move up the slope of the hill bouncing
and twisting in the frozen ruts

Here tis exclaimed Debby I remember its in this number cause
theres a picture of the Palace Hotel on the front page Lets seeDog
lostno that aint it Corner lot for salewish I had money enough
to buy it Id like nothin better than to live out there Information
wanted of my husbandHere tis Umhum

She straightened up and eagerly began reading the advertisement The
hill was very steep just at its top and the sulky slanted backward at
a sharp angle A terrific burst of wind tore around the corner of
the bluff It eddied through the sulky between the dashboard and
the curtained sides The widow in her excitement at finding the
advertisement had inadvertently removed her feet from the pile of
papers In an instant the air was filled with whirling copies of the
Blazeton Weekly Courier

Henry the horse was a sober animal who had long ago reached the age of
discretion But to have his old ears and eyes suddenly blanketed with a
flapping white thing swooping apparently from nowhere was too much even
for his sedate nerves He jumped sidewise The reins were jerked from
the drivers hands and fell in the road

Mercy on us shrieked Debby clutching her companion about the waist
What

Let go of me howled Bailey pushing her violently aside Whoa Stand
still

But Henry refused to stand still The flapping paper still clung to his
agitated head He reared and pranced jerking the sulky back and forth
its wheels still wedged in the ruts Bailey sprang to the ground to pick
up the reins He seized them but fell as he did so The tug at his bits
turned Henrys head literally and figuratively He reared and whirled
about The sulky rose on two wheels The screaming Mrs Beasley
collapsed against its downward side Another moment and the whole upper
half of the sulkybody seat curtains and Debbytilted over the
lower wheels and the rusted bolts failing to hold slid with a thump
to the frozen road The wind catching it underneath as it slid tipped
it backward Then Henry ran away



Miss Dawes left alone in the house at the foot of the hill had amused
herself for a time with the Beasley library which partially filled a
shelf in the sitting room But The Book of Martyrs and A Believers
Thoughts on Death were not cheering literature particularly as the
author of the latter volume thought so dismally concerning the future
of all who did not believe precisely as he did So the teacher laid down
the book with a shudder and wandered about the room inspecting the
late Mr Beasleys portrait the photographs in splintwork frames the
alum basket on the mantel the blue castles blue trees and blue
people pictured on the window shades and other works of art in the
apartment She even peeped into the parlor but the musty shutup
smell of that dusky tomb was too much for her and she sat down by the
sittingroom window under the empty bird cage to look up the road and
watch for the return of the sulky and its occupants

Sitting there she was a witness of the alarming catastrophe on the
hilltop and reached the front gate just in time to see Henry go
galloping by dragging the four wheels and springs of the sulky while
sprawled across the rear axle and still clinging to the reins hung a
familiar howling and most wickedly profane individual by the name of
Bangs

The runaway dashed on toward the blacksmith shop Phoebe bareheaded and
coatless ran up the hill Before she reached the crest she was aware
of muffled screams which sounded as if the screamer was shut up in a
trunk

Oooh screamed Mrs Beasley Oooh Ow Let me out Help Im
stuck My backs broke Heelp

The upper part of the sulky with its boxlike curtained top lay on
its side in the road From somewhere within the box came the groans and
screams The gale swept the hilltop and for a quarter mile to leeward
the scenery was animated by soaring fluttering copies of the Blazeton
Courier that swooped and ducked like mammoth white butterflies

The panting and alarmed teacher stooped and peered into the dark shadow
between the dashboard and the back curtain All she could make out
at first were a pair of thin ankles and Congress shoes in agitated
motion These bobbed up and down behind the overturned seat and its
displaced cushion

O Mrs Beasley screamed Phoebe Are you hurt

Debby of course did not hear the question She continued to groan
and scream for help Her lungs were not injured at all events The
schoolmistress dropping on her knees reached into the sulky top and
tugged at the seat It was rather tightly wedged but she managed to
loosen it and pull it toward her

The widow raised herself on an elbow and looked out between the flowers
of her smashed bonnet

Who is it she demanded Oh is that you Miss Dorcas Oh my soul
and body Oh my stars Oh my goodness me

Are you hurt shrieked Phoebe

Hey I dont know I dont know WHAT I be I dont know nothin

Can you help yourself Can you get up

Hey I dont know Maybe I can if you haul that everlastin seat out of
the way Oh my sakes alive

Her rescuer pulled the seat forward and with an effort tumbled it
clear of the curtains Debby raised herself still higher

Oh she groaned Talk aboutLand sakes whos comin Men aint it
Let me out of here quick QUICK

She scrambled out of her prison on hands and knees and jumped to her
feet with reassuring alacrity Her furcollared cape was draped in a
roll about her neck and her bonnet hung jauntily over her left eye

Im a sight aint I she asked Haul this bunnet straight quicks
ever you can Hurt No no I aint hurt none but my feelins Hurry
UP Spose I want them men folks to see me with everything all hind side
to

Miss Dawes relieved to find that the accident had had no serious
consequences and trying her hardest not to laugh assisted the widow
to rearrange her wearing apparel The blacksmith and his helper came
running up the hill

Hello Debby hailed the former Whats the matter Hurt be you

Mrs Beasley whether she heard or not did not deign to reply

Get my horn out of that carriage she ordered Dont stand there
gapin Get it

The ear trumpet was resurrected from the interior of the vehicle The
widow adjusted it with dignity

Had a spill didnt you Debby inquired the blacksmith Upset
didnt you

Debby glared at him

No she replied with sarcasm Course I didnt upset Just thought
Id roll round in the road for the fun of it Smart question that is
Wheres that Bailey Bangs gone to with the rest of my carriage

The blacksmith pointed to his shop in the hollow Before it stood Mr
Bangs holding Henry by the bridle and staring in their direction

Hes all right volunteered the helper The horse stopped runnin
soons he got to the foot of the next hill

Mrs Beasley was not apparently overjoyed at the news

Humph she grunted I most wish hed broke his neck Pesky careless
thing gettin us run away with and upset Whos goin to pay for fixin
my sulky I want to know

Mr Bangs will pay for it Im sure said Phoebe soothingly If he
doesnt I will Oh Mrs Beasley did you find the diary

Diary No no I told you I was afraid Id burnt it up Well I had
and a whole lot more of them old ones But I did get all them Arizona
papers and took the trouble to tote em all the way here sos you could
look at em And nowshe shook with indignation and waved her hand
toward a section of horizon where little white dots indicated the
whereabouts of the Couriersnow look where they be Blowed from Dan to
Beersheby Come on to the house and let me set down I been standin on
my head till Im tired Here Jabez to the blacksmith you tend to
that carriage will you

She stalked off down the hill The schoolmistress turning to follow her
caught a glimpse of the helper doubled up with silent laughter and
the blacksmith grinning broadly as he stooped toward the capsized sulky

Phoebe was downcast and disappointed She was convinced in her own
mind that the Honorable Atkins had some hidden motive for his espousal
of the Thomas cause Asaphs fruitless quest in Orham had not shaken
her faith Captain Cy had refused to seek Debby Beasley for information
concerning the Thayers and so she on her own responsibility had done
so And this was the ridiculous ending of her journey The diary had
been a forlorn hope now that was burned Poor Bosn and poorsome one
else

Debby marching down the hill continued to sputter about the lost
weeklies

Its an everlastin shame she declared Id just found the one with
that advertisement in it and was readin it I remember the part I read
plain as could be While were eatin dinner Ill tell you about it

But Miss Dawes did not care for dinner Like Mr Tidditt and the
captain she had had about all the Debby Beasley she wanted

Yes yes you will stop too affirmed the widow I want to tell you
more about Blazeton I can see that advertisement this minute right
afore my eyesInformation wanted of my husband Edward Higgins Five
foot eight inches tall sandy complected brown hair and yellowish
mustache not lame but has a peculiar slight limp with his left
foot

What asked the schoolmistress stopping short

Hey Has a peculiar limp with his left foot I remember how Desire
used to talk about that limp She said twas almost as if he stuttered
with his leg He hurt it when he was up in Montana and

Oh cried Miss Dawes The color had left her face

Yes You see he used to be a miner or somethin up there Hed never
say much about his younger days but one time he did tell that Id
just got as far as that limp when the sulky upset Talk about bein
surprised I never was so surprised in my life as when that horse
critter rared up and

Phoebe interrupted Her color had come back and her eyes were shining

Mrs Beasley she cried I think I shall change my mind I believe I
will stay to dinner after all Im EVER so much interested in Arizona



Bailey and the teacher began their long drive home about four oclock
The buggy axle had been fixed and the wind was less violent Mr Bangs
was glum and moody He seemed to be thinking

Say teacher he said at length Id like to ask a favor of you If
it aint necessary I wish you wouldnt say nothin about that upsettin
business to the folks to home It does sound so dum foolish Ill never
hear the last of it

Miss Dawes who had been in high spirits now took a moment for
reflection

All right she said nodding vigorously We wont mention it then
We wont tell a soul You can say that I called at the Atwoods if you
want to that will be true because I did And well have Mrs Beasley
for our secretyours and mineuntil we decide to tell Its a bargain
Mr Bangs We must shake hands on it

They shook hands and Bailey looking in her face thought he never
saw her look so well or as young She was pretty he decided Then he
thought of his own choice of a wife andwell if he had any regrets
he hasnt mentioned them not even to his fellowmember of the Board of
Strategy



CHAPTER XVII

THE CAPTAIN REMEMBERS HIS AGE


December was nearly over Christmas had come Bosn had hung up her
stocking by the baseburner stove and found it warty and dropsical
the next morning with a generous overflow of gifts piled on the floor
beneath it The Board of Strategy sent presents so did Miss Dawes and
Georgianna As for Captain Cy he spent many evening hours after the
rest of his household was in bed poring over catalogues of toys and
books and the orders he sent to the big shops in Boston were lengthy
and costly The little girls eyes opened wide when she saw the stocking
and the treasures heaped on the floor She sat in her nighty amidst
the wonders books and playthings in a circle about her and the
biggest doll of all hugged close in her arms Captain Cy who had arisen
at half past five in order to be with her on the great occasion was at
least as happy as she

Like em do you he asked smiling

like em O Uncle Cy What makes everybody so good to me

I dont know Strange thing aint itconsiderin what a hard little
ticket you are

Bosn laughed She understood her Uncle Cy and didnt mind being
called a hard ticket by him

IIdidnt believe anybody COULD have such a nice Christmas I never
saw so many nice things

Humph What do you like best

The answer was a question and was characteristic

Which did you give me asked Bosn

The captain would have dodged but she wouldnt let him So one by one
the presents he had given were indicated and put by themselves The
remainder were but few but she insisted that the givers of these should
be named When the sorting was over she sat silently hugging her doll
and apparently thinking

Well inquired the amused captain Made up your mind yet Which do
you like best

The child nodded

Why these of course she declared with emphasis pointing with her
dollies slippered foot at Captain Cys pile

So Do hey Didnt know I could pick so well All right the first
prize is mine Who takes the second

This time Bosn deliberated before answering At last however she bent
forward and touched the teachers gifts

These she said I like these next best

Captain Cy was surprised

Sho he exclaimed You dont say

Yes I think I like teacher next to you I like Georgianna and Mr
Tidditt and Mr Bangs of course but I like her a little better Dont
you uncle Cyrus

The captain changed the subject He asked her what she should name her
doll

The Board of Strategy came in during the forenoon and the presents had
to be shown to them While the exhibition was in progress Miss Dawes
called And before she left Gabe Lumley drove up in the depot wagon
bearing a big express package addressed to Miss Emily Thomas Bayport

Humph exclaimed Captain Cy Somethin more for Bosn hey Who in
the world sent it do you spose

Asaph and Bailey made various inane suggestions as to the sender Phoebe
said nothing There was a frown on her face as she watched the captain
get to work on the box with chisel and hammer It contained a beautiful
doll fully and expensively dressed and pinned to the dress was a
cardTo dear little Emmie from her lonesome Papa

The Board of Strategy looked at the doll in wonder and astonishment
Captain Cy strode away to the window

Well exclaimed Mr Bangs I didnt believe he had that much heart
inside of him I bet you that cost four or five dollars aint that so
Cy

The captain did not answer

Dont you think so teacher repeated Bailey turning to Phoebe What
ails you You dont seem surprised

Im not replied the lady I expected something of that sort

Captain Cy wheeled from the window

You DID he asked

Yes Miss Phinney said the other day she had heard that that man
was going to give his daughter a beautiful present She was very
enthusiastic about his generosity and selfsacrifice I asked who told
her and she said Mr Simpson

Oh Tad Is that so The captain looked at her

Yes And I think there is no doubt that Simpson had orders to make the
generosity known to as many townspeople as possible

Hum I see You figure that Thomas callates twill help his popularity
and make his case stronger is that it

Not exactly I doubt if he ever thought of such a thing himself But
some one thought for himand some one must have supplied the money

Well they say hes to work up in Boston

I know But no one can tell where he works Captain Whittaker this is
Mr Atkinss doingyou know it Now WHY does he a busy man take such
an interest in getting this child away from you

Captain Cy shook his head and smiled

Teacher he said youre dead set on taggin Heman with a mystery
aint you

Miss Dawes asked the forgetful Bailey when you and me went drivin
tother day did you find out anything from

Phoebe interrupted quickly

Mr Bangs she said at what time do we distribute Christmas presents
at your boarding house I suppose you must have many Christmas secrets
to keep You keep a secret SO well

Mr Bangs turned red The hint concerning secret keeping was not wasted
He did not mention the drive again

A little later Captain Cy found Bosn busily playing with the doll he
had given her The other her fathers gift was nowhere in sight

I put her back in the box said the child in reply to his question
She was awful pretty but I think Im goin to love this one best

The remark seems a foolish thing to give comfort to a grown man but
Captain Cy found comfort in it and comfort was what he needed

He needed it more as time went on In January the court gave its
decision The captains appointment as guardian was revoked With
the father alive and professedly anxious to provide for the childs
support nothing else was to be expected so Mr Peabody said The
latter entered an appeal which would delay matters for a time two or
three months perhaps meanwhile Captain Cy was to retain custody of
Bosn

But the courts action expected though it was made the captain very
blue and downcast He could see no hope He felt certain that he should
lose the little girl in the end in spite of the long succession of
appeals which his lawyer contemplated And what would become of her
then What sort of training would she be likely to have Who would her
associates be under the authority of a father such as hers And what
would he do alone in the old house when she had gone for good He
could not bear to think of it and yet he thought of little else

The evenings after Bosn had gone to bed were the worst During the
day he tried his best to be busy at something or other The doll
house was finished and he had begun to fashion a fullrigged ship in
miniature In reality Emily being a normal little girl was not greatly
interested in ships but because Uncle Cy was making it she pretended
to be vastly concerned about this one On Saturdays and after school
hours she sat on a box in the wood shed where the captain had put up
a small stove and watched him work The taboo which so many of our
righteous and Atkinsworshiping townspeople had put upon the Whittaker
place and its occupants included her and a number of children had
been forbidden to play with her This however did not prevent their
tormenting her about her father and her disreputable guardian

But the captains evenings were miserable He no longer went to
Simmonss He didnt care for the crowd there and knew they were all
down on him Josiah Dimick called occasionally and the Board of
Strategy often but their conversation was rather tiresome There were
times when Captain Cy hated Bayport the house he had fixed up with
such interest and pride and the old sitting room in particular The
mental picture of comfort and contentment which had been his dream
through so many years of struggle and wandering looked farther off than
ever Sometimes he was tempted to run away taking Bosn with him But
the captain had never run away from a fight yet he had never abandoned
a ship while there was a chance of keeping her afloat And besides
there was another reason

Phoebe Dawes had come to be his chief reliance He saw a great deal of
her Often when she walked home from school she found him hanging over
the front gate and they talked of various thingsof Bosns progress
with her studies of the school work and similar topics He called her
by her first name now although in this there was nothing unusualafter
a few weeks acquaintance we Bayporters almost invariably address people
by their front names Sometimes she came to the house with Emily Then
the three sat by the stove in the sitting room and the apartment became
really cheerful in the captains eyes

Phoebe was in good spirits She was as hopeful as Captain Cy was
despondent She seemed to have little fear of the outcome of the
legal proceedings the appeals and the rest In fact she now appeared
desirous of evading the subject and there was about her an air of
suppressed excitement Her optimism was the best sort of bracer for the
captains failing courage Her advice was always good and a talk with
her left him with shoulders squared mentally and almost happy

One cold rainy afternoon early in February she came in with Bosn
who had availed herself of the shelter of the teachers umbrella
Georgianna was in the kitchen baking and Emily had been promised a
saucer pieso the child went out to superintend the construction of
that treat

Set down teacher said Captain Cy pushing forward a rocker My
but Im glad to see you Twas bluern a whetstone round here today
Whats the newsanything

Why no replied Phoebe accepting the rocker and throwing open her
wet jacket theres no news in particular But I wanted to ask if you
had seen the Breeze

Umhum was the listless answer I presume likely you mean the news
about the appropriation and the editorial dig at yours truly Yes Ive
seen it They dont bother me much Ive got more important things on my
mind just now

Congressman Atkinss pledge in his farewell speech concerning the
mighty effort he was to make toward securing the appropriation for
Bayport harbor was in process of fulfillmentso he had written to
the local paper But alas the mighty effort was likely to prove
unavailing In spite of the Honorable Hemans battle for his
constituents rights it seemed certain that the bill would not provide
the thirty thousand dollars for Bayport at least not this years bill
Other and more powerful interests would win out and instead another
section of the coast be improved at the public expense The congressman
was deeply sorry almost brokenhearted He had battled hard for his
beloved town he had worked night and day But to be perfectly frank
there was little or no hope

Few of us blamed Heman Atkins The majority considered his letter
noble and so feeling But some one must be blamed for a community
disappointment like this and the scapegoat was on the premises How
about that committee of one selfappointed at town meeting How
about the blatant person who had declared HE could have gotten the
appropriation What had the committee done Nothing nothing at all
He had not even written to the Capitalso far as anyone could find
outmuch less gone there

So at Simmonss and the sewing circle and after meeting on Sunday Cy
Whittaker was again discussed and derided And this weeks Breeze out
that morning contained a sarcastic editorial which mentioned no names
but hinted at a certain now notorious person who had boasted loudly
but who had again been weighed in the balance of public opinion and
found wanting

Miss Dawes did not seem pleased with the captains nonchalant attitude
toward the Breeze and its editorial She tapped the braided mat with her
foot

Captain Cyrus she said if you intended doing nothing toward
securing that appropriation why did you accept the responsibility for it
at the meeting

Captain Cy looked up Her tone reminded him of their first meeting when
she had reproved him for going to sleep and leaving Bosn to the mercy
of the Cahoon cow

Well he said afore this Thomas business happened to knock all
my plans on their beam ends Id done considerble thinkin about
that appropriation It seemed to me that there must be some reason
for Hemans comin about so sudden He was sartin sure of the thirty
thousand for a spell then all to once he begun to take in sail and go
on tother tack I dont know much about politics but I know HE knows
all the politics there is And it seemed to me that if a live man one
with eyes in his head went to Washington and looked around he might
find the reason And if he did find it maybe Heman could be coaxed
into changin his mind again Anyhow I was willin to take the risk of
tryin and besides Tad and Abe Leonard had me on the griddle at that
meetin and I spoke up sharptoo sharp maybe

But you still believe that you MIGHT help if you went to Washington

Yes I guess I do Anyhow Id ask some pretty pinted questions You
see I aint lived here in Bayport all my life and I dont swaller ALL
the bait Heman heaves overboard

Then why dont you go

Hey Why dont I go And leave Bosn and

Emily would be all right and perfectly safe Georgianna thinks the
world of her And Captain Whittaker I dont like to hear these people
talk of you as they do I dont like to read such things in the paper
that you were only bragging in order to be popular and meant to shirk
when the time came for action I know theyre not true I KNOW it

Captain Cy was gratified and his gratification showed in his voice

Thank you Phoebe he said I am much obliged to you But you see
I dont take any interest in such things any more When I realize that
pretty soon Ive got to give up that little girl for good I cant bear
to be away from her a minute hardly I dont like to leave her here
alone with Georgianna and

I will keep an eye on her You trust me dont you

Trust YOU By the big dipper youre about the only one I CAN trust
these days I dont know how Id have pulled through this if you hadnt
helped Youre diffrent from Ase and Bailey and their kindnot meanin
anything against them either But youre broadminded and coolheaded
andandDo you know if Id had a woman like you to advise me all
these years and keep me from goin off the course I might have been
somebody by now

I think youre somebody as it is

Dont talk that way I own up I like to hear you but Im fraid it
aint true You say I amount to somethin Well what I come back home
here with some money in my pocket thinkin that was about all was
necessary to make me a good deal of a feller The old Cy Whittaker
place I said to myself was goin to be a real Cy Whittaker place
again And Id be a real Whittaker a man who should stand for
somethin as my dad and granddad did afore me The town should respect
me and Id do things to help it along And whats it all come to Why
every young one on the street is told to be good for fear hell grow up
like me Aint that so Course its so Im

You SHALL not speak so Do you imagine that youre not respected by
everyone whose respect counts for anything Yes and by others too
Dont you suppose Mr Atkins respects you down in his heartif he has
one Doesnt your housekeeper who sees you every day respect and like
you And little Emilydoesnt she love you more than she does all the
rest of us together

Well I guess Bosn does care for the old man some thats a fact She
says she likes you next best though Did you know that

But Miss Dawes was indignant

Captain Whittaker she declared one would think you were a hundred
years old to hear you You are always calling yourself an old man Does
Mr Atkins call himself old And he is older than you

Well Im over fifty Phoebe In spite of the habit for which he had
just been reproached the captain found this a difficult statement to
make

I know But youre younger than most of us at thirtyfive You see Im
confessing too she added with a laugh and a little blush

Captain Cy made a mental calculation

Twenty years he said musingly Twenty years is a long time No Im
old And worse than that Im an old fool I guess If I hadnt been Id
have stayed in South America instead of comin here to be hooted out of
the town I was born in

The teacher stamped her foot

Oh what SHALL I do with you she exclaimed It is wicked for you to
say such things Do you suppose that Mr Atkins would find it necessary
to work as he is doing to beat a fool And besides youre not
complimentary to me Should I do you think take such an interest in
one who was an imbecile

Well tis mighty good of you Your comin here so to help Bosns
fight along is

How do you know it is Bosn altogether I She stopped suddenly and
the color rushed to her face She rose from the rocker Ireally I
dont see how we came to be discussing such nonsense she said Our
ages and that sort of thing Captain Cyrus I wish you would go to
Washington I think you ought to go

But the captains thoughts were far from Washington at that moment His
own face was alight and his eyes shone

Phoebe he faltered unbelievingly what was you goin to say Do you
mean thatthat

The side door of the house opened The next instant Mr Tidditt a
dripping umbrella in his hand entered the sitting room

Hello Whit he hailed Just run in for a minute to say howdy Then
he noticed the schoolmistress and his expression changed Oh how be
you Miss Dawes he said I didnt see you fust off Dont run away on
my account

I was just going said Phoebe buttoning her jacket Captain Cy
accompanied her to the door

Goodby she said There was something else I meant to say but I
think it is best to wait I hope to have some good news for you soon
Something that will send you to Washington with a light heart Perhaps I
shall hear tomorrow If so I will call after school and tell you

Yes do urged the captain eagerly Youll find me here waitin Good
news or not do come II aint said all I wanted to myself

He returned to the sitting room The town clerk was standing by the
stove He looked troubled

Whats the row Ase asked Cy cheerily He was overflowing with good
nature

Oh nothin special replied Mr Tidditt You look joyful enough for
two of us Had good company aint you

Why yes bout as good as there is What makes you look so glum

Asaph hesitated

Phoebe was here yesterday too want she he asked

Yup What of it

And the day afore that

No not for three days afore that But what OF it I ask you

Well now Cy you mustnt get mad Im a friend of yours and friends
ought to be able to say most anything to each other Ifif I was you
I wouldnt let Phoebe come so oftennot here you know at your house
Course I know she comes with Bosn and all but

Out with it The captains tone was ominous What are you drivin
at

The caller fidgeted

Well Whit he stammered theres considerble talkin goin on
thats all

Talkin What kind of talkin

Well you know the kind This town does a good deal of it specially
after church and prayer meetin Seems if they thought twas a sort of
proper place _I_ dont myself I kind of like to keep my charity and
brotherly love spread out through the week but

Ase are the folks in this town sayin a word against Phoebe Dawes
because she comes here to seeBosn

Dontdont get mad Whit Dont look at me like that _I_ aint said
nothin Why a spell ago at the boardin house I

He told of the meal at the perfect boarding house where Miss Dawes
championed his friends cause Also of the conversation which followed
and his own part in it Captain Cy paced the floor

I wouldnt have her come so often Cy pleaded Asaph Honest I
wouldnt Course you and me know theyre mean miserble liars but
its her Im thinkin of Shes a young woman and single And youre
a good many years oldern she is And so of course you and she aint
ever goin to get married And have you thought what effect it might
have on her keepin her teachers place The committees a majority
against her as tis Andyou know _I_ dont think so but a good many
folks doyou aint got the best name just now Darn it all I aint
puttin this the way Id ought to but YOU know what I mean dont you
Cy

Captain Cy was leaning against the window frame his head upon his arm
He was not looking out because the shade was drawn Tidditt waited
anxiously for him to answer At last he turned

Ase he said Im much obliged to you Youve pounded it in pretty
hard but I callate Id ought to have had it done to me Im a foolan
OLD fool just as I said a while backand nothin nor NOBODY ought to
have made me forget it For a minute or so Ibut there dont you fret
That young woman shant risk her job nor her reputation on account of
menor of Bosn either Ill see to that And see here he added
fiercely I cant stop womens tongues even when theyre as bad as
some of the tongues in this town BUT if you hear a MAN say one word
against Phoebe Dawes only one word you tell me his name You hear
Ase You tell me his name Now run along will you I aint safe company
just now

Asaph frightened at the effect of his words hurriedly departed
Captain Cy paced the room for the next fifteen minutes Then he opened
the kitchen door

Bosn he called come in and set in my lap a while dont you want
to ImIm sort of lonesome little girl



The next afternoon when the schoolmistress who had been delayed by the
inevitable examination papers stopped at the Cy Whittaker place she
was met by Georgianna Emily who stood behind the housekeeper in the
doorway was crying

Capn Cy has gone awayto Washinton declared Georgianna Though
what hes gone there fors moren I know He said hed send his hotel
address soons he got there He went on the three oclock train

Phoebe was astonished

Gone she repeated So soon Why he told me he should certainly be
here to hear some news I expected today Didnt he leave any message
for me

The housekeeper turned red

Miss Phoebe she said he told me to tell you somethin and its so
dreadful I dont hardly dast to say it I think his troubles have driven
him crazy He said to tell you that youd better not come to this house
any more



CHAPTER XVIII

CONGRESSMAN EVERDEAN


In the old days the great days of sailing ships and land merchant
fleets Bayport was a community of travelers Every ambitious man went
to sea and eventually if he lived became a captain Then he took his
wife and in most cases his children with him on long voyages To the
stayathomes came letters with odd foreign stamps and postmarks Our
whatnots and parlor mantels were filled with carved bits of ivory
gorgeous shells alabaster candlesticks and plaster miniatures of
the Leaning Tower at Pisa or the Coliseum at Rome We usually began
a conversation with When my husband and I were at Hong Kong the last
time or I remember at Mauritius they always New Orleans or
Frisco were the nearest domestic ports the mention of which was
considered worth while

But this is so no longer A trip to Boston is of course no novelty to
the most of us but when we visit New York we take care to advertise it
beforehand And the few who avail themselves of the spring cut rates
and go on excursions to Washington plan definite programmes for each
day at the Capital and discuss them with envious friends for weeks in
advance And if the prearranged programme is not scrupulously carried
out we feel that we have been defrauded It was the regret of Aunt
Sophronia Halletts life that on her Washington excursion she had not
seen the Diplomatic Corpse She saw the President and the Monument and
Congress and the relics in the Smithsonian Institute but the Corpse
was not on view Aunt Sophronia never quite got over the disappointment

Probably no other Bayporter in recent years has started for Washington
on such short notice or with so illdefined a programme as Captain
Cy He went because he felt that he must go somewhere After the
conversation with Asaph he simply could not remain at home If Phoebe
Dawes called he knew that he must see her and if he saw her what
should he say to her He could not tell her that she must not visit the
Cy Whittaker place again If he did she would insist upon the reason
If he told her of the town talk he felt sure knowing her that she
would indignantly refuse to heed the malicious gossip And he was firmly
resolved not to permit her to compromise her life and her future by
friendship with a social outcast like himself As for anything deeper
and more sacred than friendship that was ridiculous If for a moment
a remark of hers had led him to dream of such a thing it was because he
was as he had so often declared an old fool

So Captain Cy had resolved upon flight and he fled to Washington
because the business of the committee of one offered a legitimate
excuse for going there The blunt message he had intrusted to Georgianna
would he believed arouse Phoebes indignation She would not call
again And when he returned to Bosn it would be to take up the childs
fight alone If he lost that fight or WHEN he lost it he would close
the Cy Whittaker place and leave Bayport for good

He had been in Washington once before years ago when he was first
mate of a ship and had a few weeks shore leave Then he went there on
a pleasure trip with some seagoing friends and had a jolly time But
there was precious little jollity in the present visit He had never
felt so thoroughly miserable In order to forget he made up his mind to
work his hardest to discover why the harbor appropriation was not to be
given to Bayport

The city had changed greatly He would scarcely have known it He
went to the hotel where he had stayed before and found a big modern
building in its place The clerk was inclined to be rather curt and
perfunctory at first but when he learned that the captain was not
anxious concerning the price of accommodations but merely wanted a
comftable berth somewheres on the saloon deck and appeared to have
plenty of money he grew polite Captain Cy was shown to his room where
he left his valise Then he went down to dinner

After the meal was over he seated himself in one of the big leather
chairs in the hotel lobby smoked and thought In the summer before
Bosn came and before her father had arisen to upset every calculation
and wreck all his plans the captain had given serious thought to what
he should do if Congressman Atkins failed as even then he seemed likely
to do in securing that appropriation The obvious thing of course
would have been to hunt up Mr Atkins and question him But this was
altogether too obvious In the first place the strained relations
between them would make the interview uncomfortable and in the
second if there was anything underhand in Hemans backsliding on the
appropriation Atkins was too wary a bird to be snared with questions

But Captain Cy had another acquaintance in the city the son of a still
older acquaintance who had been a wealthy shipping merchant and mine
owner in California The son was also a congressman from a coast State
and the captain had read of him in the papers A sketch of his life had
been printed and this made his identity absolutely certain Captain
Cys original idea had been to write to this congressman Now he
determined to find and interview him

He inquired concerning him of the hotel clerk who like all Washington
clerks was a walking edition of Whos Who at the Capital

Congressman Everdean repeated the allknowing young gentleman Yes
Hes in town Has rooms at the Gloria second hotel on the right as you
go up the avenue Only a short walk What can I do for you sir

The Gloria was an even bigger hotel than the one where the captain had
his berth An inquiry at the desk of another important clerk was
answered with a brisk

Mr Everdean Yes he rooms here Dont know whether hes in or not
Evening judge Nice Winter weather were having

The judge who was a ponderous person vaguely suggesting the great
Heman admitted that the weather was fine patronizing it as he did so
The clerk continued the conversation Captain Cy waited At length he
spoke

Excuse me commodore he said I dont like to break in until youve
settled whether you have it snow or not but Im here to see Congressman
Everdean Hadnt you better order one of your fomast hands to hunt him
up

The judge condescended to smile as did several other men who stood
near The clerk reddened

Do you want to see Mr Everdean he snapped

Why yes I did But I cant see him from here without strainin my
eyesight

The clerk sharply demanded one of the captains visiting cards
He didnt get one for the very good reason that there was none in
existence

Tell him an old friend of his dads is here on the main deck waitin
for him said Captain Cy Thatll do first rate Thank you admiral

Word came that the congressman would be down in a few moments The
captain beguiled the interval by leaning on the rail and regarding the
clerk with an awed curiosity that annoyed its object exceedingly The
inspection was still on when a tall man of an age somewhere in the
early thirties walked briskly up to the desk

Who is it that wants to see me he asked

The clerk waved a deprecatory hand in Captain Cys direction The
newcomer turned

My name is Everdean he said Are youheyGreat Scott Is it
possible this is Captain Whittaker

The captain was immensely pleased

Well I declare Ed he exclaimed I didnt believe youd remember me
after all these years You was nothin but a boy when I saw you out
in Frisco Well well No wonder youre in Congress A man that can
remember faces like that ought to be President

Everdean laughed as they shook hands

Dont suppose Id forget the chap who used to dine with us and tell me
those sea stories do you he said Im mighty glad to see you What
are you doing here The last father and I heard of you you were in
South America Given up the sea they said and getting rich fast

Captain Cy chuckled

Its a good thing I learned long ago not to believe all I hear he
answered else Id have been so sure I was rich that Id have spent all
I had and been permanent boarder at the poorhouse by now No thanks
Ive had dinner Why yes Ill smoke if youll help along Hows your
father Smart is he

The congressman insisted that they should adjourn to his rooms An
unmarried man he kept bachelors hall at the hotel during his stay in
Washington There in comfortable chairs they spoke of old times when
the captain was seafaring and the Everdean home had been his while his
ship was in port at Frisco He told of his return to Bayport and the
renovation of the old house Of Bosn he said nothing At last Everdean
asked what had brought him to Washington

Well said Captain Cy Ill tell you Im like the feller in court
without a lawyer he said he couldnt tell whether he was guilty or not
count of havin no professional advice Thats what Ive come to you
for Edprofessional advice

He told the harbor appropriation story At the incident of the
committee of one his friend laughed heartily

Rather put your foot in it that time Captain didnt you he said

Yup Then I got tother one stuck tryin to get the first clear Hows
it look to you All straight do you think or is there a nigger in the
wood pile

Mr Everdean seemed to reflect

Well Captain he said I cant tell Youre asking delicate
questions Politicians are like doctors they usually back up each
others opinions Still youre at least as good a friend of mine as
Atkins is Queer HE should bob up in this matter Why hebut never
mind that now I tell you Captain Whittaker you come around and have
dinner with me tomorrow night In the meantime Ill see the chairman
of the committee on that billone of the socalled pork bills it
is Possibly from him and some other acquaintances of mine I may learn
something At any rate you come to dinner

So the invitation was accepted and Captain Cy went back to his own
hotel and his room He slept but little although it was not worry over
the appropriation question which kept him awake Next morning he wrote a
note to Georgianna giving his Washington address With it he enclosed
a long letter to Bosn telling her he should be home pretty soon and
that she must be a good girl and boss the ship during his absence
He sent his regards to Asaph and Bailey but Phoebes name he did not
mention Then he put in a miserable day wandering about the city At
eight that evening he and his Western friend sat down at a corner table
in the big dining room of the Gloria

The captain began to ask questions as soon as the soup was served but
Everdean refused to answer

No no he said pleasure first and business afterwards thats a
congressional motto I cant talk Atkins with my dinner and enjoy it

Cant hey You wouldnt be popular at our perfect boarding house back
home There they serve Heman hot for breakfast and dinner and warm him
over for supper All right I can wait

The conversation wandered from Buenos Ayres to Frisco and back again
until the cigars and coffee were reached Then the congressman blew a
fragrant ring into the air and from behind it looked quizzically at
his companion

Well he observed so far as that appropriation of yours is
concerned

He paused and blew a second ring Captain Cy stroked his beard

Umyes he drawled now that you mention it seems to me there was
some talk of an appropriation

Mr Everdean laughed

Ive been making inquiries he said I saw the chairman of the
committee on the pork bill I know him well Hes a good fellow but

Yes I know Ive seen lots of politicians like that theyre all good
fellers butIf I was in politics Id make a law to cut But out of
the dictionary

Well this chap really is a good fellow I asked about the thirty
thousand dollars for your town He asked me why I didnt go to the
congressman from that district and not bother him about it I said
perhaps I would go to the congressman later but I came to him first

Sartin Same as the feller with a sick motherinlaw stopped in at the
undertakers on his way to call the doctor All right heave ahead

Well we had a rather long conversation I discovered that the Bayport
item was originally included in the bill but recently had been stricken
out

Yes I see Uncle Sam had to economize hey Save somethin for a rainy
day

Well possibly Still the bill is just as heavy Now Captain
Whittaker I dont KNOW anything about this affair and its not my
business But Ive been about today and I asked questions andIm
going to tell you a fairy tale It isnt as interesting as your sea
yarns butDo you like fairy stories

Land yes Tell a few myself when its necessary Sometimes I almost
believe em Well

Of course you must remember this IS a fairy story Lets suppose that
once on a timethats the way they always beginonce on a time there
was a great man great in his own country who was sent abroad by his
people to represent them among the rulers of the land So in order to
typically represent them he dressed in glad and expensive raiment went
about in dignity and

And whiskers Dont leave out the whiskers

All rightand whiskers And it came to pass that the people whom he
represented wished totoerbring about a certain needed improvement
in theirtheir beautiful and enterprising community

Sho sho how natural that sounds You must be a mind reader

No But I have to make speeches in my own community occasionally
Well the people asked their great man to get the money needed for this
improvement from the rulers of the land aforementioned And he was
at first all enthusiasm and upon thethe parchment scroll where
such matters are inscribed was written the name of the beautiful and
enterprising community and the sum of money it asked for And the deal
was as good as made Excuse the modern phraseology my fairy lingo got
mixed there

Never mind I can get the drift just as wellmaybe better

And the deal was as good as made But before the vote was taken another
chap came to the great man and said Look here I want to get an
appropriation of say fifty thousand dollars to deepen and improve a
river down in my Statea Southern State well say Ive been to the
chairman of the pork bill committee and he says its impossible The
bill simply cant be loaded any further But I find that you have an
item in there for deepening and improving a harbor back in your own
district Why dont you cut that item outshove it over until
next year You can easily find a satisfactory explanation for your
constituents AND you want to remember this the improvement of this
river means that thethewell a certain sugargrowing companycan
get their stuff to market at a figure which will send its stock up and
up And you are said to own a considerable amount of that stock So why
not drop the harbor item and substitute my river slice Then Well I
guess thats the end of the tale

He paused and relit his cigar Captain Cy thoughtfully marked with his
fork on the tablecloth

Hum he grunted Thats a very interestin yarn Yes yes dont
knows I ever heard a more interestin one I presume likely there aint
a mite of proof that its true

Not an atom I told you it was a fairy tale And I mustnt be quoted in
the matter Honestly the most of it is guess work at that But perhaps
a committee of one dropping a hint at home might at least arouse
some uncomfortable questioning of a certain great man Thats about all
though Proof is quite another thing

The captain pondered He was fully aware that the unpopularity of the
committee would nullify whatever good its hinting might do

Humph he grunted again Its one thing to smell a rat and another to
nail its tail to the floor But Im mighty obliged to you all the same
And Ill think it over hard Say I can see one thingyou dont take a
very big shine to Heman yourself

Not too bigno Do you

Well I dont wake up nights and cry for him

Everdean laughed

Thats characteristic he said You have your own way of putting
things Captain and its hard to be improved on Atkins has never done
anything to me I justI just dont like him thats all Father never
liked him either in the old days and yetand its odd toohe was
the means of the old gentlemans making the most of his money

He Who Not Heman

Yes Heman Atkins But so far as that goes father started him toward
wealth I suppose At least he was poor enough before the mine was
sold

What are you talkin about Heman got his start tradin over in the
South Seas Sellin the Kanakas glass beads and calico for pearls and
copratwo cupfuls of pearls for every bead Anyhow thats the way the
yarn goes

I cant help that He was just a common sailor who had run away from
his ship and was gold mining in California And when he and his partner
struck it rich father borrowed money headed a company and bought them
out That mine was the Excelsior and its just as productive today
as it ever was I rather think Atkins must be very sorry he sold I
suppose by right I should be very grateful to your distinguished
representative

Well I do declare Sho sho Aint that funny now Hes never said a
word about it at home I dont believe theres a soul in Bayport knows
that We all thought twas South Sea tradin that boosted Heman And
your own dad I declare this is a small world

Its odd father never told you about it Its one of the old
gentlemans pet stories He came West in 1850 and was running a little
shipping store in Frisco He met Atkins and the other young sailor
his partner before they left their ship They were in the store buying
various things and father got to know them pretty well Then they
ran away to the diggingsyou simply couldnt keep a crew in those
timesand he didnt see them again for a good while Then they came
in one day and showed him specimens from a claim they had back in the
mountains They were mighty good specimens and what they said about the
claim convinced father that they had a valuable property So he went to
see a few welltodo friends of his and the outcome was that a party
was made up to go and inspect The young fellows were willing to sell
out for it was a quartz working and they hadnt the money to carry it
on

The inspection showed that the claim was likely to be even better than
they thought so after some bargaining the deal was completed They
sold out for seventyfive thousand dollars and it was the best trade
father ever made Hes so proud of his judgment and foresight in making
it that I wonder he never told you the story

He never did When was this

In 54 What

I didnt speak The date seemed kind of familiar to me thats all
Seems as if I heard it recent but I cant remember when Seventyfive
thousand hey Well that want so bad was it With that for a nest
egg no wonder Hemans managed to hatch a pretty respectable brood of
dollars

Oh the whole seventyfive wasnt his of course Half belonged to his
partner But the poor devil didnt live to enjoy it After the articles
were signed and before the money was paid over he was taken sick with a
fever and died

Hey He died With a FEVER

Yes But he left a pretty good legacy to his heirs didnt he For
a common sailoror second mate I believe thats what he
wasthirtyseven thousand five hundred is doing well It must have come
as a big surprise to them The whole sum was paid to Atkins whoWhats
the matter with you

Captain Cy was leaning back in his chair He was as white as the
tablecloth

Are you ill asked the congressman anxiously Take some water Shall
I call

The captain waved his hand

No no he stammered No Im all right Do youfor the Lords sake
tell me this What was the name of this partner that died

Mr Everdean looked curiously at his friend before he answered

Sure youre not sick he asked Well all right The partners name
Why Ive heard it often enough Its on the deed of sale that father
has framed in his room at home The old gentleman is as proud of that as
anything in the house The name waswas

For God sakes cried Captain Cy dont say twas John Thayer Cause
if you do I shant believe it

Thats what it wasJohn Thayer How did you guess Did you know him I
remember now that he was another Down Easter like Atkins

The captain did not answer He clasped his forehead with both hands and
leaned his elbows on the table Everdean was plainly alarmed

Im going to call a doctor he began rising But Captain Cy waved him
back again

Set still he ordered Set still I tell you You say the whole
seventyfive thousand was paid to Heman but that John Thayer signed
the bill of sale afore he died as half partner And your dads got the
original deed andandhe remembers the whole business

Yes hes got the deedframed Its on record too of course
Remembers I should say he did Hell talk for a week on that subject
if you give him a chance

The captain sprang to his feet His chair tipped backward and fell to
the floor An obsequious waiter ran to right it but Captain Cy paid no
attention to him

Wheres my coat he demanded Wheres my coat and hat

What ails you asked Everdean Are you going crazy

Goin CRAZY No no Im goin to California Whens the next train



CHAPTER XIX

THE TOPPLING OF A MONUMENT


The Honorable Heman Atkins sat in the library of his Washington home
before a snapping log fire reading a letter Mr Atkins had as he
would have expressed it served his people in Congress for so many
years that he had long since passed the hotel stage of living at the
Capital He rented a furnished house on an eminently respectable street
and the polished doorplate bore his name in uncompromising characters

The library furniture was solid and dignified Its businesslike
appearance impressed the stray excursionist from the Atkins district
when he or she visited the great man in whose affairs we felt such a
personal interest Particularly impressive and significant was a map of
the district hanging over the congressmans desk and an oil painting
of the Atkins mansion at Bayport which with the iron dogs and urns
conspicuous in its foreground occupied the middle of the largest wall
space

The cheery fire was very comforting on a night like this for the sleet
was driving against the windowpanes the sidewalks were ankle deep in
slush and the wet cold wind from the Potomac was whistling down the
street Somewhere about the house an unfastened shutter slammed in the
gusts Mr Atkins should have been extremely comfortable as he sat there
by the fire He had spent many comfortable winters in that room But now
there was a frown on his face as he read the letter in his hand It was
from Simpson and stated among other things that Cyrus Whittaker had
been absent from Bayport for over two weeks and that no one seemed
to know where he had gone The idea seems to be that he started for
Washington wrote Tad but if that is so it is queer you havent
seen him I am suspicious that he is up to something about that harbor
business I should keep my eye peeled if I was you

Alicia the Atkins hopeful rustled into the room

Papa she said Ive come to kiss you good night

Her father performed the ceremony in a perfunctory way

All right all right he said Now run along to bed and dont bother
me theres a good girl I wish he added testily to the housekeeper
who had followed Alicia into the room I wish youd see to that loose
blind It makes me nervous Such things as that should be attended to
without specific orders from me

The housekeeper promised to attend to the blind She and the girl left
the library Heman reread the Simpson letter Then he dropped it in his
lap and sat thinking and twirling his eyeglasses at the end of their
black cord His thoughts seemed to be not of the pleasantest The lines
about his mouth had deepened during the last few months He looked
older

The telephone bell rang sharply Mr Atkins came out of his reverie
with a start arose and walked across the room to the wall where the
instrument hung It was before the days of the convenient desk phone
He took the receiver from its hook and spoke into the transmitter

Hello he said Hello Yes yes stop ringing What is it

The wire buzzed and purred in the storm Hello said a voice Hello
there Is this Mr Atkinss house

Yes it is What do you want

Hey Is this where the Honorable Heman Atkins lives

Yes yes I tell you This is Mr Atkins speaking What do you want

Oh is that you Heman This is WhittakerCy Whittaker Understand

Mr Atkins understood Yet for an instant he did not reply He had been
thinking as he sat by the fire of certain persons and certain ugly
though remote possibilities Now from a mysterious somewhere one of
those persons was speaking to him The hand holding the receiver shook
momentarily

Hello I say Heman do you understand This is Whittaker talkin

Ierunderstand said the congressman slowly Well sir

Im here in Washinton

I have been informed that you were in the city Well sir

Oh knew I was here did you Is that so Who told you Tad wrote I
suppose hey

The congressman did not reply immediately This man whom he disliked
more than anyone else in the world had an irritating faculty of putting
his finger on the truth And the flippancy in the tone was maddening
Mr Atkins was not used to flippancy

I believe I am not called upon to disclose my source of information
he said with chilling dignity It appears to have been trustworthy I
presume you have phoned me concerning the appropriation matter I do
not recognize your right to intrude in that affair and I shall decline
to discuss it Yes sir To my people to those who have a right to
question I am and shall always be willing to explain my position Good
night

Wait Hello Hold on a minute Dont get mad Heman I only wanted to
say just a word Youll let me say a word wont you

This was more like it This was more nearly the tone in which Mr Atkins
was wont to be addressed It was possible that the man recognizing the
uselessness of further opposition desired to surrender

I cannot declared the Honorable understand why you should wish to
speak with me We have very little in common very little Im thankful
to say However I will hear you briefly Go on

Much obliged Well Heman I only wanted to say that I thought maybe
youd better have a little talk with me Im here at the hotel the
Regent You know where tis I presume likely I guess youd better come
right down and see me

Heman gasped actually gasped with astonishment

_I_ had better come and see YOU I Well sir WELL I am not
accustomed

I know but I think youd better Its dirty weather and Ive got cold
somehow or other I aint feelin quite up to the mark so I callate
Ill stay in port much as I can You come right down Ill be in my
room and the hotel folks ll tell you where tis Ill be waitin for
you

Mr Atkins breathed hard In his present frame of mind he would have
liked to deliver a blast into that transmitter which would cause the
person at the other end of the line to shrivel under its heat But he
was a politician of long training and he knew that such blasts were
sometimes expensive treats It might be well to hear what his enemy had
to say But as to going to see himthat was out of the question

I do not he thundered I do not care to continue this conversation
Ifif you wish to see me after what has taken place between us I
am willing in spite of personal repugnance to grant you a brief
interview My servants will admit you here at nine oclock tomorrow
morning But I tell you now that your interference with this
appropriation matter is as useless as it is ridiculous and impudent It
is of a piece with the rest of your conduct

All right Heman all right was the calm answer I dont say youve
got to come I only say I guess youd better Im goin back to Bayport
tomorrer early And if I was you Id come and see me tonight

I have no wish to see you Nor do I care to talk with you further That
appropriation

Maybe it aint all appropriation

Then I cannot understand

I know but _I_ understand Ive come to understand considerble many
things in the last fortnit There I cant holler into this machine any
longer Ive been clear out to Frisco and back in eleven days and I
got cold in those blessed sleepin cars I

The receiver fell from the congressmans hand It was a difficult object
to pick up again Heman groped for it in a blind strangely inadequate
way Yet he wished to recover it very much

Wait wait he shouted anxiously III dropped theAre you there
Whittaker Are youOh yes I didntDid you sayerFrisco

Yes San Francisco California Ive been West on a little cruise
Had an interestin time Its an interestin place dont you think so
Well Im sorry you cant come Good night

Wait faltered the great man IIlet me think Cyrus I do not
wish to seemerarrogant in this matter It is not usual for me to
visit my constituents butbutI have no engagement this evening
and you are not well andHello are you there Hello Why under the
circumstances I thinkYes I will come Ill comeerat once

The telephone enables one to procure a cab in a short time Yet to
Heman Atkins that cab was years in coming He paced the library floor
his hand to his forehead and his brain whirling It couldnt be It
must be a coincidence He had been an idiot to display his agitation and
surrender so weakly And yetand yet

The ride through the storm to the Regent Hotel gave him opportunity for
more thought But he gained little comfort from thinking If it was a
coincidence well and good If not

A bell boy conducted him to the Whittaker room on the saloon deck It
was a small room very different from the Atkins library and Captain
Cy in a caneseated chair was huddled close to the steam radiator He
looked far from well

Evenin Heman he said as the congressman entered Pretty dirty
night aint it What wed call a gray notheaster back home Sit down
Dont mind my not gettin up This heatin arrangement feels mighty
comftable just now If I get too far away from it I shiver my deck
planks loose Take off your things

Mr Atkins did not remove his overcoat His hat he tossed on the bed
He glanced fearfully at his companion The latters greeting had been
so casual and everyday that he took courage And the captain looked
anything but formidable as he hugged the radiator Perhaps things were
not so bad as he had feared He resolved not to seem alarmed at all
events

Have a cigar Heman said Captain Cy No Well all right I will if
you dont mind

He lit the cigar The congressman cleared his throat

Cyrus he said I am not accustomed to run at the beck and call of
myeracquaintances but even though we have disagreed of late even
though to me your conduct seems quite unjustifiable still for the sake
of our boyhood friendship and because you are not well Iercame

Captain Cy coughed spasmodically a cough that seemed to be tearing him
to pieces He looked at his cigar regretfully and laid it on the top of
the radiator

Too bad he observed Tobacco genrally iles up my talkin machinery
but just now it seems to make me bark like a ships dog shut up in the
hold Why yes Heman I see youve come Much obliged to you

This politeness was still more encouraging Atkins leaned back in his
chair and crossed his legs

I presume he said that you wish to ask concerning the
appropriation I regret

You neednt I guess well get the appropriation

Hemans condescension vanished He leaned forward and uncrossed his
legs

Indeed he said slowly his eyes fixed on the captains placid face

Yesindeed

Whittaker what are you talking about Do you suppose that I have been
the representative of my people in Congress all these years without
knowing whereof I speak They left the matter in my hands and your
interference

I aint goin to interfere IM goin to leave it in your hands too
And I callate youll be able to find a way to get it Umhum I guess
likely you will

The visitor rose to his feet The time had come for another blast from
Olympus He raised the mighty right arm But Captain Cy spoke first

Sit down Heman said the captain quietly Sit down This aint town
meetin Never mind the appropriation now Theres other matters to be
talked about first Sit down I tell you

Mr Atkins was purple in the face but he sat down The captain coughed
again

Heman he began when the spasm was over I asked you to come here
tonight forwell blessed if I know exactly It didnt make much
difference to me whether you came or not

Then sir I must say that of all the impudent

Sshh for the land sakes Speechmakin must be as bad as the rum
habit when a fellers got it chronic as you have No it didnt make
much difference to me whether you came or not But honest youve got
to be a kind of Bunker Hill monument to the folks back home They kneel
down at your foundations and look up at you and tell each other how
many foot high you are and what it cost to build you and how you stand
for patriotism and purity tillwell _I_ couldnt see you tumble down
without givin you a chance I couldnt twould be like blowin up a
church

The purple had left the Atkins face but the speechmaking habit is not
likely to be broken

Cyrus Whittaker he stammered have you been drinking Your language
to me is abominable Why I permit myself to remain here and listen to
such

If youll keep still Ill tell you why And if I was you I wouldnt
be too anxious to find out This everlastin cold dont make me over n
above goodtempered and when I think of what youve done to that little
girl or what you tried to do I have to hold myself down tight TIGHT
and dont you forget it Now you keep quiet and listen Itll be best
for you Heman Your cards aint under the table any longer Ive seen
your hand and I know why youve been playin it I know the whole game
Ive been West and Everdean and I have had a talk

Mr Atkins had again risen from the chair Now he fell heavily back
into it His lips moved as if he meant to speak but he did not At
the mention of the Everdean name he made a queer choking sound in his
throat

I know the whole business Heman went on the captain I know why
you was so knocked over when you learned who Bosn was the night of
the party I know why you took up with that blackguard Thomas and why
youve spent your good money hirin lawyers for him I know about the
mine I know the whole thing from first to last Shall I tell you Do
you want to hear it

The great man did not answer A drop of perspiration shone on his high
forehead and the veins of his big white hands stood out as he clutched
the arms of his chair The monument was tottering on its base

Its a dirty mess the whole of it continued Captain Cy And yet I
can seeI suppose I can see some excuse for you at the beginnin When
old man Everdean and his crowd bought you and John Thayer out way
back there in 54 after John died and all the money was put into your
hands I callate you was honest then I wouldnt wonder if you MEANT
to hand over the thirtyseven thousand five hundred dollars to your
partners widow But twas harder and more risky to send money East in
them days than tis now and so you waited thinkin maybe that youd
fetch it to Emily when you come yourself But you didnt come home for
some years you went tradin down along the Feejees and around that way
Thats how I reasoned it out these last few days on the train I give
you credit for bein honest first along

But never mind whether you was or not you havent been since You
never paid over a cent of that poor fellers moneyhonest money that
belonged to his heirs and belongs to em now Youve hung onto it
stole it used it for yours And Emily worked and scratched for a livin
and died poor And Mary she died after bein abused and deserted by
that cussed husband of hers And you thought you was safe I callate
And then Bosn turns up right in your own town right acrost the road
from you By the big dipper its enough to make a feller believe that
the Almighty does take a hand in straightenin out such things when us
humans bungle emit is so

Course I aint sure Heman what you meant to do when you found that
the child youd stole that money from was goin to be under your face
and eyes till you or she died I callate you was afraid Id find
somethin out want you I presume likely you thought that I not
havin quite the reverence for you that the rest of the Bayporters
have might be sharp enough or lucky enough to smell a rat Perhaps you
suspicioned that I knew the Everdeans Anyhow you wanted to get the
child as fur out of your sight and out of my hands as you couldaint
that so And when her dad turned up you thought you saw your chance
Heman you answer me this Aint it part of your bargain with Thomas
that when he gets his little girl he shall take her and clear out away
off somewheres for good Aint it nowwhat

The monument was swaying was swinging from side to side but it did not
quite fallnot then The congressmans cheeks hung flabby his forehead
was wet and he shook from head to foot but he clenched his jaws and
made one last attempt at defiance

II dont know what you mean he declared Youyou seem to be
accusing me of something Of stealing I believe Do you understand who
I am I have some influence and reputation and it is dangerous toto
try to frighten me Proofs are required in law and

Sshh You know Ive got the proofs They were easy enough to get
once I happened on the track of em Lord sakes Heman I aint a fool
Whats the use of your pretendin to be one Theres the deed out in
Frisco with yours and Johns name on it Theres the records to prove
the sale Theres the receipt for the seventyfive thousand signed by
you on behalf of yourself and your partners widow Theres old man
Everdean alive and competent to testify Theres John Thayers will on
file over to Orham Proofs Why you THIEF if its proofs you want
Ive got enough to send you to states prison for the rest of your life
Dont you dare say proofs to me again Heman Atkins you owe me
as Bosns guardian thirtyseven thousand five hundred dollars with
interest since 1854 What you goin to do about it

Here was one ray a feeble ray of light

Youre not her guardian cried Atkins The courts have thrown you
out And your appeal wont stand either If any money is due it
belongs to her father She isnt of age No sir her father

Captain Cys patience had been giving way Now he lost it altogether He
strode across the room and shook his forefinger in his victims face

So he cried Thats your tack is it By the big dipper You GO to
her fatherjust you go to him and tell him Just hint to him that you
owe his daughter thirtyodd thousand dollars and see what hell
do Good heavens above he was ready to sell her out to me for fifty
dollars wuth of sand bank in Orham Almost ready he was till you
offered a higher price to him to fight Why hell have your hide nailed
up on the barn door If you dont pay him every red copper down on
the nail hell wring you dry And then hell blackmail you forever and
ever amen Unless of course _I_ go home and stop the blackmail by
printing my story in the Breeze Ive a precious good mind to do it By
the Almighty I WILL do it unless you come off that high horse of yours
and talk like a man

And then the monument fell fell prostrate with a sickly pitiful
crash If we of Bayport could have seen our congressman then The great
man great no longer broke down completely He cried like a baby It
was all trueall true He had not meant to steal at first He had been
led into using the money in his business Then he had meant to send it
to the heirs but he didnt know their whereabouts Captain Cy smiled
at this excuse And now he couldnt payhe COULDNT He had hardly that
sum in the world He had lost money in stocks his property in the South
had gone to the bad He would be ruined He would have to go to prison
He was getting to be an old man And there was Alicia his daughter
Think of her Think of the disgrace And so on over and over with
the one recurring burdenwhat was the captain going to do what was
he going to do It was a miserable dreadful exhibition and Captain Cy
could feel no pride in his triumph

There there he said at last Stop it man stop it for goodness
sakes Pull yourself together I guess we can fix it up somehow I aint
goin to be too hard on you If it want for your meanness in bein
willin to let Bosn suffer her life long with that drunken beast of a
dad of hers Id feel almost like tellin you to get up and forget it
But THATS got to be stopped Now you listen to me

Heman listened He was on his knees beside the bed his face buried in
his arms and his gray hair the leonine Atkins hair which he was wont
to toss backward in the heated periods of his eloquence tumbled and
draggled Captain Cy looked down at him

This whole business about Bosn must be stopped he said and stopped
right off You tell your lawyers to drop the case Her dad is only
hangin around because you pay him to He dont want her he dont care
what becomes of her If you pay him enough hell go wont he and not
come back

The congressman raised his head

Why yes he faltered I think he will Yes I think I could arrange
that But Cyrus

The captain held up his hand

I intend to look out for Bosn he said She cares for me moren
anyone else in the world Shes as much to me as my own child ever
could be and Ill see that she is happy and provided for Im religious
enough to believe she was sent to me and I intend to stick to my trust
As for the money

Yes yes The money

Well I wont be too hard on you that way either Well talk that over
later on Maybe we can arrange for you to pay it a little at a time You
can sign a paper showin that you owe it and well fix the payin to
suit all hands Taint as if the child was in want Ive got some money
of my own and whats mines hers I think we neednt worry about the
money part

God bless you Cyrus I

Yes all right Im sure your askin for the blessin ll be a great
help Now you do your part and Ill do mine No one knows of this
business but me I didnt tell Everdean a word He dont know why I
hustled out there and back nor why I asked so many questions And he
aint the kind to pry into what dont concern him So youre pretty
safe I callate Now if you dont mind I wish youd run along home
ImIm used up sort of

Mr Atkins arose from his knees Even then broken as he washe looked
ten years older than when he entered the roomhe could hardly believe
what he had just heard

You mean he faltered Cyrus do you mean thatthat youre not going
to reveal thisthis

That Im not goin to tell on you Yup thats what I mean You get rid
of Thomas and squelch that law case and Ill keep mum You can trust me
for that

Butbut Cyrus the people at home Your story in the Breeze Youre
not

No they neednt know either Itll be between you and me

God bless you Ill never forget

Thats right You mustnt Forgettin is the one thing you mustnt do
And see here youre boss of the political fleet in Bayport you steer
the school committee now Phoebe Dawes aint too popular with that
committee Id see that she was popularized

Yes yes she shall be She shall not be disturbed Is there anything
else I can do

Why yes I guess there is Speakin of popularity made me think of it
That harbor appropriation had better go through

A very faint tinge of color came into the congressmans chalky face He
hesitated in his reply

II dont know about that Cyrus he said The bill will probably be
voted on in a few days It is made up and

Then Id strain a pint and make it over Id work real hard on it Im
sorry about that sugar river but I callate Bayport ll have to come
first Yes itll have to Heman it sartin will

The reference to the sugar river was the final straw Evidently this
man knew everything

IIll try my best affirmed Heman Thank you Cyrus You have been
more merciful than I had a right to expect

Yes I guess I have Why do I do it He smiled and shook his head
Well I dont know For two reasons maybe First Id hate to be
responsible for tippin over such a skytowerin idol as youve been to
make ruins for Angie Phinney and the other blackbirds to peck at and caw
over And secondwell it does sound presumin dont it but I kind
of pity you Say Heman he added with a chuckle thats a kind of
distinction in a way aint it A good many folks have hurrahed over
you and worshipped yousome of em I guess likely have envied you
but by the big dipper I do believe Im the only one in this round
world that ever PITIED you Goodby The elevators right down the
hall

It required some resolution for the Honorable Atkins to walk down that
corridor and press the elevator button But he did it somehow A guest
came out of one of the rooms and approached him as he stood there It
was a man he knew Heman squared his shoulders and set every nerve and
muscle

Good evening Mr Atkins said the man A miserable night isnt it

Miserable indeed replied the congressman The strength in his voice
surprised him The man passed on Heman descended in the elevator
walked steadily through the crowded lobby and out to the curb where
his cab was waiting The driver noticed nothing strange in his fares
appearance He noticed nothing strange when the Atkins residence was
reached and its tenant mounted the stone steps and opened the door
with his latchkey But if he had seen the dignified form collapse in a
library chair and moan and rock back and forth until the morning hours
he would have wondered very much indeed


Meanwhile Captain Cy coughing and shivering by the radiator had been
summoned from that warm haven by a knock at his door A bell boy stood
at the threshold holding a brown envelope in his hand

The clerk sent this up to you sir he said It came a week ago When
you went away you didnt leave any address and whatever letters came
for you were sent back to Bayport Massachusetts The clerk says you
registered from there sir But he kept this telegram It was in your
box and the day clerk forgot to give it to you this afternoon

The captain tore open the envelope The telegram was from his lawyer
Mr Peabody It was dated a week before and read as follows


 Come home at once Important



CHAPTER XX

DIVIDED HONORS


The blizzard began that night Bayport has a generous allowance of
storms and gales during a winter although as a usual thing there is
more rain than snow and more wind than either But we can count with
certainty on at least one blizzard between November and April and about
the time when Captain Cy feverish and ill the delayed telegram in
his pocket and a great fear in his heart boarded the sleeper of the
Eastbound train at Washington snow was beginning to fall in our
village

Next morning when Georgianna came downstairs to prepare Bosns
breakfastthe housekeeper had ceased to go home nights since the
captains absencethe world outside was a tumbled driving whirl of
white The woodshed and barn dimly seen through the smother were but
gray shapes emerging now and then only to be wiped from the vision as
by a great flapping cloth wielded by the mighty hand of the wind The
old house shook in the blasts the windowpanes rattled as if handfuls of
small shot were being thrown against them and the carpet on the floor
of the dining room puffed up in miniature billows

School was out of the question and Bosn her breakfast eaten prepared
to put in a cozy day with her dolls and Christmas playthings

When DO you spose Uncle Cyrus will get home she asked of the
housekeeper She had asked the same thing at least three times a
day during the fortnight and Georgiannas answer was always just as
unsatisfactory

I dont know dearie Im sure Hell be here pretty soon though
dont you fret

Oh I aint going to fret I know hell come He said he would and
Uncle Cy always does what he says he will

About twelve Asaph made his appearance a white statue

Godfrey scissors he panted shaking his snowplastered cap over the
coal hod Say this is one of em aint it Dont knows I ever see
more of a one Drift out by the front fence pretty nigh up to my waist
This ll be a nasty night along the Orham beach The lifesavers ll have
their hands full Whew Im about tuckered out

Been to the post office asked Georgianna in a low tone

Yup I been there Mornin mail just this minute sorted Trains two
hours late Gabe says moren likely the evenin train wont be able to
get through at all if this keeps up

Was there anything from

Mr Tidditt glanced at Bosn and shook his head

Not a word he said Funny aint it It dont seem a bit like him
And he cant be to Washinton because all them letters came back II
swan to man Im beginnin to get worried

Worried Im pretty nigh crazy What does Phoebe Dawes say

She dont say much Its pretty tough when everything else is workin
out so fine thanks to her to have this happen No she dont say much
but she acts pretty solemn

Say Mr Tidditt

Yes what is it

You dont spose anything that happened betwixt her and Capn Whittaker
that afternoon is responsible forfor his stayin away so do you You
know what he told me to tell herabout her not comin here

Asaph fidgeted with the wet cap

Aw that aint nothin he stammered That is I hope it aint I did
say somethin to him thatbut Phoebe understands Shes a smart woman

You havent told them boardin house tattletales about theEmmie you
go fetch me a card of matches from the kitchen wont youof whats
been found out about that Thomas thing

Course I aint Didnt Peabody say not to tell a soul till we was sure
Spose Id tell Keturah and Angie Mights well paint it on a sign and
be done with it No no Ive kept mum and you do the same Well I
must be goin Hope to goodness we hear some good news from Whit by
tomorrer

But when tomorrow came news of any kind was unobtainable No trains
could get through and the telephone and telegraph wires were out of
commission owing to the great storm Bayport was buried under a white
coverlet three feet thick on a level which shone in the winter sun
as if powdered with diamond dust The streetshoveling brigade meaning
most of the active male citizens was busy with plows and shovels
Simmonss was deserted in the evenings for most of the regular habitues
went to bed after supper tired out

Two days of this Then Gabe Lumley his depot wagon replaced by a
sleigh drove the panting Daniel into the yard of the Cy Whittaker
place Gabe was much excited He had news of importance to communicate
and was puffed up in consequence

The wires all right again Georgianna he said to the housekeeper
who had hurried to the door to meet him Fust message just come
through Guess who its for

Stop your foolishness Gabe Lumley ordered Miss Taylor Hand over
that telegram this minute Dont you stop to talk Hand it over

Gabe didnt intend to be corked thus peremptorily

Its pretty important news Georgianna he declared Kind of bad
news too I think Id ought to prepare you for it sort of When Capn
Obed Pepper died I

DIED For the land sakes WHAT are you sayin Give me that you
foolhead Give it to me

She snatched the telegram from him and tore it open It was not as bad
as might have been but it was bad enough Lawyer Peabody wired that
Captain Cyrus Whittaker was at his home in Ostable sick in bed and
threatened with pneumonia



Captain Cy hurrying homeward in response to the attorneys former
telegram had reached Boston the day of the blizzard He had taken the
train for Bayport that afternoon The train had reached Ostable after
nine oclock that night but could get no farther The captain burning
with fever and torn by chills had wallowed through the drifts to his
lawyers home and collapsed on his doorstep Now he was very ill and at
times delirious

For two weeks he lay fighting off the threatened attack of pneumonia
But he won the fight and at last word came to the anxious ones at
Bayport that he was past the danger point and would pull through There
was rejoicing at the Cy Whittaker place The Board of Strategy came and
performed an impromptu war dance around the diningroom table

Wheee shouted Bailey Bangs tossing Bosn above his head Your
Uncle Cys weathered the Horn and is bound for clear water now Three
cheers for our side Wont we give him a reception when we get him back
here

Wont we crowed Asaph Well I just guess we will You ought to hear
Angie and the rest of em chant hymns of glory about him A bodyd think
they always knew he was the salt of the earth Maybe I dont rub it in a
little hey Oh no maybe not

And Heman chimed in Mr Bangs And Heman Would you ever believe
HED change so all of a sudden Bully old Whit I can mention his name
now without Keturys landin onto me like a snowslide Whee I say
wheee

He continued to say it and Georgianna and Asaph said what amounted to
the same thing A change had come over our Bayport social atmosphere
a marvelous change And at Simmonss andmore wonderful stillat
Tad Simpsons barber shop plans were being made and perfected for
proceedings in which Cyrus Whittaker was to play the most prominent
part

Meanwhile the convalescence went on at a rapid rate As soon as he was
permitted to talk Captain Cy began to question his lawyer How
about the appeal Had Atkins done anything further The answers were
satisfactory The case had been dropped the Honorable Heman had
announced its withdrawal He had said that he had changed his mind and
should not continue to espouse the Thomas cause In fact he seemed to
have whirled completely about on his pedestal and like a compass now
pointed only in one directiontoward his boyhood friend and present
neighbor Cyrus Whittaker

Its perfectly astounding commented Peabody What in the world
captain did you do to him while you were in Washington

Oh nothin much was the rather disinterested answer Him and me
had a talk and he saw the error of his ways I callate Hows Bosn
today Did you give her my love when you phoned

So far as the case is concerned went on the lawyer I think
we should have won that anyway Its a curious thing Thomas has
disappeared How he got word or who he got it from _I_ dont know but
he must have and hes gone somewhere no one knows where And yet Im
not certain that we were on the right trail It seemed certain a week
ago but now

The captain had not been listening He was thinking Thomas had gone
had he Good Heman was living up to his promises And Bosn God bless
her was free from that danger

Have you heard from Emmie I asked you he repeated

He would not listen to anything further concerning Thomas either then
or later He was sick of the whole business he declared and now that
everything was all right didnt wish to talk about it again He asked
nothing about the appropriation and the lawyer acting under strict
orders did not mention it

Only once did Captain Cy inquire concerning a person in his home town
who was not a member of his household

How iserhows the teacher he inquired one morning

Hows who

WhyPhoebe Dawes the schoolteacher Smart is she

Yes indeed Why she has been the most

The doctor came in just then and the interview terminated It was not
resumed because that afternoon Mr Peabody started for Boston on a
business trip to be gone some time

And at last came the great day the day when Captain Cy was to be taken
home He was up and about had been out for several short walks and was
very nearly his own self again He was in good spirits too at times
but had fits of seeming depression which under the circumstances were
unexplainable The doctor thought they were due to his recent illness
and forbade questioning

The original plan had been for the captain to go to Bayport in the
train but the morning set for his departure was such a beautiful
one that Mr Peabody who had the day before returned from the city
suggested driving over So the open carriage drawn by the Peabody
span was brought around to the front steps and the captain bundled
up until as he said he felt like a wharf rat inside a cotton bale
emerged from the house which had sheltered him for a weary month and
climbed to the back seat The attorney got in beside him

All ashore thats goin ashore observed Captain Cy Then to the
driver who stood by the horses heads he added Stand by to get ship
under way commodore Im homeward bound and theres a little messmate
of mine waitin on the dock already I wouldnt wonder So dont hang
around these waters no longern you can help

But Mr Peabody smiled and laid a hand on his shoulder

Just a minute captain he said Weve got another passenger She
came to the house last evening but Dr Cole thought this would be an
exciting day for you and you must sleep in preparation for it So we
kept her in the background It was something of a job butHurrah here
she is

Mrs Peabody the lawyers wife opened the front door She was
laughing The next moment a small figure shot past her down the steps
and into the carriage like a redhooded bombshell

Uncle Cyrus she screamed joyously Uncle Cyrus its me Here I am

And Captain Cy springing up and shedding wraps and robes received the
bombshell with open arms and hugged it tight

Bosn he shouted By the big dipper BOSN Why you
littleyouyou

That was a wonderful ride Emily sat in the captains laphe positively
refused to let her sit beside him on the seat although Peabody urged
it fearing the child might tire himand her tongue rattled like a
sewing machine She had a thousand things to tell about her school
about Georgianna about her dolls about Lonesome the cat and how many
mice he had caught about the big snowstorm

Georgianna wanted me to stay at home and wait for you Uncle Cy she
said but I teased and teased and finally they said I could come over
I came yesterday on the train Mr Tidditt went with me to the depot
Mrs Peabody let me peek into your room last night and I saw you eating
supper You didnt know I was there did you

You bet I didnt Thered have been a mutiny right then if Id caught
sight of you You little sculpin Playin it on your Uncle Cy was you
I didnt know you could keep a secret so well

Oh yes I can Why I know an ever so much bigger secret too It
isWhy I most forgot You just wait

The captain laughingly begged her to divulge the big secret but she
shook her small head and refused The horses trotted on at a lively
pace and the miles separating Ostable and Bayport were subtracted one
by one It was magnificent winter weather The snow had disappeared from
the road except in widely separated spots but the big drifts still
heaped the fields and shone and sparkled in the sunshine Against their
whiteness the pitch pines and cedars stood darkly green and the skeleton
scrub oaks and bushes cast delicate bluepenciled shadows The bay
seen over the flooded frozen salt meadows and distant dunes was in its
winter dress of the deepest sapphire trimmed with whitecaps and fringed
with stranded ice cakes There was a snap and tang in the breeze which
braced one like a tonic The party in the carriage was a gay one

Getting tired captain asked Peabody

Who Me Well I guess not Most home Bosn Theres the salt works
ahead there

They passed the abandoned salt works the crumbling ruins of a dead
industry and the boundary stone now half hidden in a drift marking
the beginning of Bayport township Then from the pine grove at the
curve farther on appeared two capped and coated figures performing a
crazy fandango

Whos them two lunatics inquired Captain Cy whoopin and carryin
on in the middle of the road Has anybody up this way had a jug come by
express orHey WHAT Why you old idiots you COME here and let me get
a hold of you

The Board of Strategy swooped down upon the carriage like Trumet
mosquitoes on a summer boarder They swarmed into the vehicle Bailey on
the front seat and Asaph in the rear where somehow or other they made
room for him There were handshakings and thumps on the back

What you doin way up here in the west end of nowhere demanded
Captain Cy By the big dipper Im glad to see you Howd you get
here

Walked cackled Bailey Frogged it all the way Soons Mrs Peabody
wired you was goin to ride me and Ase started to meet you Want you
surprised

We wanted to be the fust to say howdy old man explained Asaph
Wanted to welcome you back you know

The captain was immensely pleased

Well Im glad Ive got so much popularity anyhow he said Guess
twill be different when I get down street hey Dont callate Tad and
Angie ll shed the joyous tear over me Never mind longs my friends
are glad I dont care about the rest

The Board looked at each other

Tad repeated Bailey And Angie What you talkin about Why
theyUgh

The last exclamation was the result of a tremendous dig in the ribs from
the Tidditt fist Asaph who had leaned forward to administer it
was frowning and shaking his head Mr Bangs relapsed into a grinning
silence

West Bayport seemed to be deserted At one or two houses however
feminine heads appeared at the windows One old lady shook a calico
apron at the carriage A child beside her cried Hurrah

Aunt Hepsy histin colors by mistake laughed the captain She
aint got her specs I guess and thinks Im Heman That comes of ridin
astern of a span Peabody

But as they drew near the Center flags were flying from frontyard
poles Some of the houses were decorated

What in the world began Captain Cy Land sakes look at the
schoolhouse And Simmonss Andand Simpsons

The schoolhouse flag was flapping in the wind The scarred wooden
pillars of its portico were hidden with bunting Simmonss front
displayed a row of little banners each bearing a letterthe letters
spelled Welcome Home Tads barber shop was more or less artistically
wreathed in colored tissue paper There too a flag was draped over the
front door Yet not a single person was in sight

For goodness sake cried the bewildered captain Whats all this
mean And where is everybody Have all hands

He stopped in the middle of the sentence They were at the foot of
Whittakers Hill Its top between the Atkinss gate and the Whittaker
fence was black with people Children pranced about the outskirts of
the crowd A shout came down the wind The horses not in the least
fatigued by their long canter trotted up the slope The shouting grew
louder A wave of youngsters came racing to meet the equipage

Whatwhat in time gasped Captain Cy Whats up I

And then the town clerk seized him by the arm Peabody shook his other
hand Bosn threw her arms about his neck Bailey stood up and waved his
hat

Its you you old critter whooped Asaph Its YOU dyou
understand

The appropriation has gone through explained the lawyer and this is
the celebration in consequence And you are the star attraction because
you see everyone knows you are responsible for it

Thats what howled the excited Bangs And were goin to show you
what we think of you for doin it Weve been plannin this for over a
fortnit

And I knew it all the time squealed Bosn and I didnt tell a word
did I

Three cheers for Captain Whittaker bellowed a person in the crowd
This personwonder of wonderswas Tad Simpson

The cheering was considering the size of the crowd tremendous
Bewildered and amazed Captain Cy was assisted from the carriage and
escorted to his front door Amidst the handkerchiefwaving applauding
people he saw Keturah Bangs and Alpheus Smalley and Angeline Phinney and
Captain Salterseven Alonzo Snow his recent opponent in town meeting
Josiah Dimick was there too apparently having a fit

On the doorstep stood Georgianna andandyes it was truebeside her
grandly extending a welcoming hand the majestic form of the Honorable
Heman Atkins Some one else was there also some one who hurriedly
slipped back into the crowd as the owner of the Cy Whittaker place came
up the path between the hedges

Mr Atkins shook the captains hand and then turning toward the people
held up his own for silence To all outward appearance he was still the
great Heman our district idol philanthropist and leader His silk hat
glistened as of old his chest swelled in the old manner his whiskers
were just as dignified and aweinspiring For an instant as he met
the captains eye his own faltered and fell and there was a pleading
expression in his face the lines of which had deepened just a little
But only for an instant then he began to speak

Cyrus he said it is my pleasant duty on behalf of your neighbors
and friends here assembled to welcome you to yourerancestral home
after your trying illness I do it heartily sincerely gladly And
it is the more pleasing to me to perform this duty because as I have
explained publicly to my fellowtownspeople all disagreement between us
is ended I was wrongagain I publicly admit it A scheming blackleg
posing in the guise of a loving father imposed upon me I am sorry for
the trouble I have caused you Of you and of the little girl with you I
ask pardonI entreat forgiveness

He paused Captain Cy the shadow of a smile at the corner of his mouth
nodded and said briefly

All right Heman I forgive you Few heard him the majority were
applauding the congressman Sylvanus Cahoon whispering in the ear
of Uncle Bedny expressed as his opinion that that was about
as magnaminious a thing as ever I heard said Yes sir
magnaminiousthats what _I_ call it

But continued the great Atkins I have said all this to you before
What I have to say nowwhat I left my duties in Washington expressly to
come here and sayis that Bayport thanks you _I_ thank you for your
tremendous assistance in obtaining the appropriation which is to make
our harbor a busy port where our gallant fishing fleet may ride at
anchor and unload its catch instead of transferring it in dories as
heretofore Friends I have already told you how this manlaying
a hand on the captains shouldercame to the Capital and used his
influence among his acquaintances in high places with the result that
the thirty thousand dollars which I had despaired of getting was added
to the bill I had the pleasure of voting for that bill It passed I am
proud of that vote

Tremendous applause Then some one called for three cheers for Mr
Atkins They were given But the recipient merely bowed

No no he said deprecatingly No no not for me my friends much
as I appreciate your gratitude My days of public service are nearly
at an end As I have intimated to some of you already I am seriously
considering retiring from political life in the near future But that
is irrelevant it is not material at present Today we meet not to say
farewell to the setting but to greet the rising sun _I_ call for three
cheers for our committee of oneCaptain Cyrus Whittaker

When the uproar had at last subsided there were demands for a speech
from Captain Cy But the captain facing them his arms about the
delighted Bosn positively declined to orate

IIm ever so much obliged to you folks he stammered I am so But
youll have to excuse me from speechmaking Theythey didnt teach it
afore the mast where I went to college Thank you just the same And
do come and see me everybody Me and this little girl drawing Emily
nearer to him will be real glad to have you

After the handshaking and congratulating were over the crowd dispersed
It was a great occasion all agreed to that but the majority considered
it a divided triumph The captain had done a lot for the town of
course but the Honorable Atkins had made another splendid impression by
his address of welcome Most people thought it as fine as his memorable
effort at town meeting Unlike that one however in this instance it
is safe to say that none not even the adoring and praisechanting Miss
Phinney derived quite the enjoyment from the congressmans speech that
Captain Cy did It tickled his sense of humor

Ase he observed irrelevantly when the fiveTidditt Georgianna
Bailey Bosn and himself were at last alone again in the sitting room
it DONT pay to tip over a monument does itnot out in public I
mean You wouldnt want to see me blow up Bunker Hill would you

Blow up Bunker Hill repeated Asaph in alarmed amazement Godfrey
scissors I believe youre goin loony This days been too much for
you What are you talkin about

Oh nothin with a quiet chuckle I was thinkin out loud thats
all Did you ever notice them imitation stone pillars on Hemans house
Theyre holler inside but youd never guess it And long as you do
know theyre holler you can keep a watch on em And theres one thing
sure he added they ARE ornamental



CHAPTER XXI

CAPTAIN CYS PICTURE


Wonder where Phoebe went to remarked Mr Tidditt a little later I
thought I saw her with Heman and Georgianna on the front steps when we
drove up

She was there affirmed the housekeeper Shed been helpin me trim
up the rooms here What do you think of em Capn Cyrus Aint they
pretty

The sitting room and dining room were gay with evergreens and
oldfashioned flowers Our living room windows in the winter time are
usually filled with carefully tended potted plants and the neighbors
had loaned their geraniums and fuchsias and heliotrope and begonias to
brighten the Whittaker house for its owners return Captain Cy who
was sitting in the rocker with Bosn on his knee looked about him
Now that the first burst of excitement was over he seemed grave and
preoccupied

They look mighty pretty Georgianna he said Fine enough But what
was that you just said Did

Yup interrupted Miss Taylor who had scarcely ceased talking since
breakfast that morning Yes twas teacher that helped fix em Not
that I wouldnt have got along without her but I had more to do than a
little cleanin and scrubbin up So Phoebe she come in andOh yes
as I was sayin she was out front with me but the minute your carriage
drove up with that lovely spanAINT that a fine span I callate
theyre

What become of teacher broke in Bailey

Why she run off somewheres I didnt see where she went to I was too
busy hollerin at Capn Whittaker and noticin that span I bet you they
made Angie Phinneys eyes stick out I guess she realizes that we in
this house are some punkins now If I dont lord it over her when I run
acrost her these days then I miss my guess I

Belay ordered Captain Cy his gravity more pronounced than ever How
does it happen that youSee here Georgianna did you tell PherMiss
Dawes what I told you to tell her when I went away

Why yes I told her I hated to dreadful but I done it She was
awful set back at fust but I guess she asked Mr TiddittWhere you
goin Mr Tidditt

The town clerk his face red was on his way to the door

Asked Ase repeated the captain Ase come here Did you tell her
anything

Asaph was very much embarrassed

Well he stammered I didnt mean to Cy but she got to askin me
questions and somehow or nother I did tell her about our confab yours
and mine I told her that I knew folks was talkin and I felt twas
my duty to tell you so Thats why I done it and I told her you
saidwell you know what you said yourself Cy

Captain Cy was evidently much disturbed He put Bosn down and rose to
his feet

Well he asked sharply what did she say

Oh she was white and still for a minute or two Then she kind of
stamped her foot and went off and left me But next time she met me she
was nice as pie Shes been pretty frosty to Angie and the rest of
em but shes been always nice to Bailey and me Why when I asked her
pardon she said not at all she was very glad to know the truth it
helped her to understand things And you could see she meant it too
She

So she has been comin here ever since And the gossip has been goin
on I spose Well by the big dipper itll stop now Ill see to
that

The Board of Strategy and the housekeeper were amazed

Gossip repeated Bailey Well I guess there aint nothin said
against her nownot in THIS town there aint Why all hands cant
praise her enough for her smartness in findin out about that Thomas If
it want for her hed be botherin you yet Cy You know it What are
you talkin about

Captain Cy passed his hand over his forehead

Bosn he said slowly you run and help Georgianna in the kitchen
a spell Shes got her dinner to look out for I guess likely
Georgianna to the housekeeper who looked anything but eager you
better see to your dinner right off and take Emmie with you

Miss Taylor reluctantly departed leading Bosn by the hand The child
was loath to leave her uncle but he told her he wouldnt give a cent
for his first dinner at home if she didnt help in preparing it So she
went out happy

Now then demanded the captain whats this about Phoebe and Thomas
I want to know Stop Dont ask another question Answer me first

So the Board of Strategy by turns and in concert told of the drive
to Trumet and the call on Debby Beasley Asaph would have narrated the
story of the upset sulky but Bailey shut him up in short order

Never mind that foolishness he snapped You see Cy Debby had just
been out to Arizona visitin old Beasleys niece And shed fell in with
a woman out there whose husband had run off and left her And Debby she
read the advertisement about him in the Arizona paper and it said he
had the spring halt in his off hind leg or somethin similar Now
Thomas he had that too and there was other things that reminded
Phoebe of him So she dont say nothin to nobody but she writes to
this woman askin for more particlars and a photograph of the missin
one The particlars come but the photograph didnt the wife didnt
have none I blieve But there was enough to send Phoebe hotfoot to Mr
Peabody And Peabody he writes to his lawyer friend in Butte Montana
And the Butte man he

Well the long and short of it is cut in Tidditt that it looked
safe and sartin that Thomas HAD married the Arizona woman while his real
wife Bosns ma was livin and had run off and left her same as he
did Mary And the funny part of it is

The funny part of it is declared Bangs drowning his friends voice
by raising his own that somebody out there some scalawag friend of
this Thomas must have got wind of what was up and sent word to him
Cause when they went to hunt for him in Boston hed gone skipped
cut stick And they aint seen him since He was afraid of bein took up
for bigamist you seefor bein a bigamy I mean Well you know what
Im tryin to say Anyhow if it hadnt been for me and Phoebe

YOU and Phoebe snorted Asaph You had a whole lot to do with it
didnt you You and Aunt Debby ll do to go together I understand shes
cruisin round makin proclamations that SHE was responsible for the
whole thing No sirree its Phoebe Dawes that the credit belongs to
and this town aint done nothin but praise her since it come out You
never see such a quick comeabout in your lifeunless twas Hemans
But you knew all this afore Whit Peabody must have told you

Captain Cy had listened to his friends story with a face expressive of
the most blank astonishment As he learned of the trip to Trumet and
its results his eyes and mouth opened and he repeatedly rubbed his
forehead and muttered exclamations Now at the mention of his lawyers
name he seemed to awaken

Hold on he interrupted waving his hand Hold on By the big dipper
this isisWhere IS Peabody I want to see him

Here I am captain said the attorney He had been out to the barn to
superintend the stabling of the span but for the past five minutes had
been standing unnoticed by his client on the threshold of the dining
room

See here demanded Captain Cy see here Peabody is this yarn true
IS it now this aboutabout Phoebe and all

Certainly its true I supposed you knew it You didnt seem surprised
when I told you the case was settled

Surprised Why no I thought Heman hadNever mind that Land of love
SHE did it She

He sat weakly down The lawyer looked anxious

Mr Tidditt he whispered I think perhaps he had better be left
alone for the present Hes just up from a sick bed and this has been
a trying forenoon Come in again this afternoon I shall try to persuade
him to take a nap

The Board of Strategy its curiosity unsatisfied departed reluctantly
When Mr Peabody returned to the sitting room he found that naps were
far indeed from the captains thoughts The latter was pacing the
sittingroom floor

Where is she he demanded She was standin on the steps with Heman
Have you seen her since

His friend was troubled

Why yes Ive seen her he said I have been talking with her She
has gone away

Gone AWAY Where What do you mean She aintaint left Bayport

No no What in the world should she leave Bayport for She has gone
to her boarding house I guess at all events she was headed in that
direction

Why didnt she shake hands with me What made her go off and not say a
word Oh well I guess likely I know the why He sighed despondently
I told her never to come here again

You did What in the world

Well for what I thought was good reasons all on her account they was
And yet she did come back and kept comin even after Ase blabbed the
whole thing However I spose that was just to help Georgianna Oh
hum I AM an old fool

The lawyer inspected him seriously

Well captain he said slowly if it is any comfort for you to know
that your reason isnt the correct one for Miss Dawess going away I
can assure you on that point I think she went because she was greatly
disappointed and didnt wish to see you just now

Disappointed What do you mean

Humph I didnt mean to tell you yet but I judge that Id better No
one knows it here but Miss Dawes and I and probably no one but us three
need ever know it You see the fact is that the Arizona woman Desire
Higgins isnt Mrs Thomas at all He isnt her missing husband

What

Yes its so Really it was too much of a coincidence to be possible
and yet it certainly did seem that it would prove true This Higgins
woman was apparently so anxious to find her missing man that she was
ready to recognize almost any description and the slight lameness and
the fact of his having been in Montana helped along If we could have
gotten a photograph sooner the question would have been settled Only
last week while I was in Boston I got word from the detective agency
that a photo had been received I went to see it immediately There was
some resemblance but not enough Henry Thomas was never Mr Higgins

Butbutthey say Thomas has skipped out

Yes he has Thats the queer part of it At the place where he boarded
we learned that he got a letter from Arizonatrust the average landlady
to look at postmarksthat he seemed greatly agitated all that day and
left that night No one has seen him since Why he went is a puzzle
Where we dont care So long as he keeps out of our way thats
enough

Captain Cy did not care either He surmised that Mr Atkins might
probably explain the disappearance And yet oddly enough this
explanation was not the true one The Honorable Heman solemnly assured
the captain that he had not communicated with Emilys father He
intended to do so as a part of the compact agreed upon at the hotel
but the man had fled And the mystery is still unsolved The supposition
is that there really was a wife somewhere in the West Who or where she
was no Bayporter knows Henry Thomas has never come back to explain

I told Miss Dawes of the photograph and what it proved went on
Peabody She was dreadfully disappointed She could hardly speak when
she left me I urged her to come in and see you but she wouldnt
Evidently she had set her heart on helping you and the child It is too
bad because practically speaking we owe everything to her There
is little doubt that the inquiry set on foot by her scared the Thomas
fellow into flight And she has worked night and day to aid us She is
a very clever woman Captain Whittaker and a good one You cant thank
her enough Here what are you about

Captain Cy strode past him into the dining room The hat rack hung on
the wall by the side door He snatched his cap from the peg and was
struggling into his overcoat

Where are you going demanded the lawyer You mustnt attempt to walk
now You need rest

Rest Ill rest by and by Just now Ive got business to attend to Let
go of that peajacket

But

No buts about it Ill see you later So long

He threw open the door and hurried down the walk The lawyer watched him
in amazement Then a slow smile overspread his face

Captain he called Captain Whittaker

Captain Cy looked back over his shoulder What do you want he asked

Mr Peabodys face was now intensely solemn but there was a twinkle in
his eye

I think shes at the boarding house he said demurely Im pretty
certain youll find her there

All the regulars at the perfect boarding house had of course attended
the reception at the Cy Whittaker place None of them with the
exception of the schoolmistress had as yet returned Dinner had been
forgotten in the excitement of the great day and Keturah and Angeline
and Mrs Tripp had stopped in at various dwellings along the main road
to compare notes on the captains appearance and the Atkins address
Asaph and Bailey and Alpheus Smalley were at Simmonss

Captain Cy knew better than to attempt his hurried trip by way of the
road He had no desire to be held up and congratulated He went across
lots in the rear of barns and orchards wading through drifts and
climbing fences as no sane convalescent should But the captain at that
moment was suffering from the form of insanity known as the fixed idea
She had done all this for himfor HIM And his last message to her had
been an insult

He approached the Bangs property by the stable lane No one locks doors
in our village and those of the perfect boarding house were unfastened
He entered by way of the side porch just as he had done when Gabe
Lumleys depot wagon first deposited him in that yard But now he
entered on tiptoe The dining room was empty He peeped into the sitting
room There by the center table sat Phoebe Dawes her elbow on the arm
of her chair and her head resting on her hand

Ahem Phoebe said Captain Cy

She started turned and saw him standing there Her eyes were wet and
there was a handkerchief in her lap

Phoebe said the captain anxiously have you been cryin

She rose on the instant A great wave of red swept over her face The
handkerchief fell to the floor and she stooped and picked it up

Crying she repeated confusedly Why no of courseof course not
IHow do you do Captain Whittaker Imwere all very glad to see you
home againand well

She extended her hand Captain Cy reached forward to take it then he
hesitated

I dont think Id ought to let you shake hands with me Phoebe he
said Not until I beg your pardon

Beg my pardon Why

He absently took the hand and held it

For the word I sent to you when I went away Twas an awful thing to
say but I meant it for your sake you know Honest I did

She laughed nervously

Oh that she said Well I did think you were rather particular as
to your visitors But Mr Tidditt explained and thenYou neednt beg
my pardon I appreciate your thoughtfulness I knew you meant to be kind
to me

Thats what I did But you didnt obey orders You kept comin Now
why

Why Did you suppose that _I_ cared for the malicious gossip ofsuch
people I came because you were in trouble and I hoped to help you
Andand I thought I had helped until a few minutes ago

Her lip quivered That quiver went to the captains heart

Helped he faltered Helped Why youve done so much that I cant
ever thank you Youve been the only real helper Ive had in all this
miserable business Youve stood by me all through

But it was all wrong He isnt the man at all Didnt Mr Peabody tell
you

Yes yes he told me What difference does that make Peabody be
hanged He aint in this Its you and medont you see What made you
do all this for me

She looked at the floor and not at him as she answered

Why because I wanted to help you she said Ive been alone in the
world ever since mother died years ago Ive had few real friends Your
friendship had come to mean a great deal to me The splendid fight you
were making for that little girl proved what a man you were And you
fought so bravely when almost everyone was against you I couldnt help
wanting to do something for you How could I And now it has come to
nothingmy part of it Im so sorry

It aint neither Its come to everything Phoebe I didnt mean to
say very much more than to beg your pardon when I headed for here But
Ive got toIve simply got to This cant go on I cant have you
keep comin to see meand Bosn I cant keep meetin you every day I
CANT

She looked up as if to speak but something possibly the expression in
his face caused her to look quickly down again She did not answer

I cant do it continued the captain desperately Taint for what
folks might say They wouldnt say much when I was around I tell you
It aint that Its because I cant bear to have you just a friend
Either you must be moren that oror Ill have to go somewheres else
I realized that when I was in Washinton and cruisin to California and
back Ive either got to take Bosn and go away for good oror

She would not help him She would not speak

You see he groaned You see Phoebe what an old fool I am I cant
ask you to marry me me fiftyfive and rough from knockin round the
world and you young and educated and a lady I aint fool enough to
ask such a thing as that And yet I couldnt stay here and meet you
every day and by and by see you marry somebody else By the big dipper
I couldnt do it So thats why I cant shake hands with you todaynor
any more except when I say goodby for keeps

Then she looked up The color was still bright in her face and her eyes
were moist but she was smiling

Cant shake hands with me she said Please what have you been doing
for the last five minutes

Captain Cy dropped her hand as if his own had been struck with
paralysis

Good land he stammered I didnt know I did it honest truth I
didnt

Phoebes smile was still there faint but very sweet

Why did you stop she queried I didnt ask you to

Why did I stop Why because III declare Im ashamed

She took his hand and clasped it with both her own

Im not she said bravely her eyes brightening as the wonder and
incredulous joy grew in his Im very proud And very very happy



There was to be a big supper at the Cy Whittaker place that night It
was an impromptu affair arranged on the spur of the moment by Captain
Cy who in spite of the lawyers protests and anxiety concerning his
health went serenely up and down the main road inviting everybody he
met or could think of The captains face was as radiant as a spring
sunrise His smile as Asaph said pretty nigh cut the upper half
of his head off People who had other engagements and would under
ordinary circumstances have refused the invitation couldnt say no to
his hearty Cant come Course youll come Man alive I WANT you

Invalid is he observed Josiah Dimick after receiving and accepting
his own invitation Well I wish to thunder I could be took down with
the same kind of disease Id be willin to linger along with it quite
a spell if it pumped me as full of joy as Whit seems to be Dont give
laughin gas to keep off pneumonia do they No Well Id like to know
the name of his medicine thats all

Supper was to be ready at six Georgianna assisted by Keturah Bangs
Mrs Sylvanus Cahoon and other volunteers was gloriously busy in the
kitchen The table in the dining room reached from one end of the big
apartment to the other Guests would begin to arrive shortly Wily Mr
Peabody guessing that Captain Cy might prefer to be alone had taken
the Board of Strategy out riding behind the span

In the sitting room around the baseburner stove were three
personsCaptain Cy Bosn and Phoebe Miss Dawes had come early at
the captains urgent appeal Now she was sitting in the rocker at
one side of the stove gazing dreamily at the ruddy light behind the
isinglass panes She looked quietly blissfully contented and happy
At her feet on the braided mat sat Bosn playing with Lonesome who
purred lazily The little girl was happy too for was not her beloved
Uncle Cyrus at home again with all danger of their separation ended
forevermore

As for Captain Cy himself the radiant expression was still on his face
brighter than ever He looked across at Phoebe who smiled back at him
Then he glanced down at Bosn And all at once he realized that this was
the fulfillment of his dream Here was his picture the sitting room
was now as he had always loved to think of itas it used to be He was
in his fathers chair Phoebe in the one his mother used to occupy and
between themjust where he had sat so often when a boythe child The
Cy Whittaker place had again and at last come into its own

He drew a long breath and looked about the room at the stove the
lamp the old familiar furniture at his grandfathers portrait over
the mantel Then in a flash of memory his fathers words came back to
him and he said laughing aloud from pure happiness

Bosn run down cellar and get me a pitcher of cider wont
youtheres a good feller
