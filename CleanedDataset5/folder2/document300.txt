 The Declaration of Independence of
 The United States of America


When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people
to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another
and to assume among the Powers of the earth the separate and equal
station to which the Laws of Nature and of Natures God entitle them a
decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should
declare the causes which impel them to the separation

We hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created
equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of
Happiness That to secure these rights Governments are instituted
among Men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed
That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends
it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it and to
institute new Government laying its foundation on such principles and
organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely
to effect their Safety and Happiness Prudence indeed will dictate
that Governments long established should not be changed for light and
transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shown that
mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than
to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are
accustomed But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing
invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under
absolute Despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off
such Government and to provide new Guards for their future security
Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies and such is
now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems
of Government The history of the present King of Great Britain is a
history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct
object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States To
prove this let Facts be submitted to a candid world

He has refused his Assent to Laws the most wholesome and necessary for
the public good

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing
importance unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should
be obtained and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend
to them

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large
districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of
Representation in the Legislature a right inestimable to them and
formidable to tyrants only

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual
uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their Public Records
for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his
measures

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly for opposing with
manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people

He has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause
others to be elected whereby the Legislative Powers incapable of
Annihilation have returned to the People at large for their exercise
the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of
invasion from without and convulsions within

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States for that
purpose obstructing the Laws of Naturalization of Foreigners refusing
to pass others to encourage their migration hither and raising the
conditions of new Appropriations of Lands

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent
to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers

He has made judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their
offices and the amount and payment of their salaries

He has erected a multitude of New Offices and sent hither swarms of
Officers to harass our People and eat out their substance

He has kept among us in times of peace Standing Armies without the
Consent of our legislatures

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to
the Civil Power

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to
our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws giving his Assent to
their Acts of pretended legislation

For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us

For protecting them by a mock Trial from Punishment for any Murders
which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world

For imposing taxes on us without our Consent

For depriving us in many cases of the benefits of Trial by Jury

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring
Province establishing therein an Arbitrary government and enlarging
its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument
for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies

For taking away our Charters abolishing our most valuable Laws and
altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments

For suspending our own Legislatures and declaring themselves invested
with Power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever

He has abdicated Government here by declaring us out of his Protection
and waging War against us

He has plundered our seas ravaged our Coasts burnt our towns and
destroyed the lives of our people

He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to
compleat the works of death desolation and tyranny already begun with
circumstances of Cruelty  perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most
barbarous ages and totally unworthy of the Head of a civilized nation

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas
to bear Arms against their Country to become the executioners of their
friends and Brethren or to fall themselves by their Hands

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us and has endeavoured
to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian
Savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction
of all ages sexes and conditions

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in
the most humble terms Our repeated Petitions have been answered only
by repeated injury A Prince whose character is thus marked by every
act which may define a Tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free
People

Nor have We been wanting in attention to our British brethren We have
warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to
extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us We have reminded them of
the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here We have
appealed to their native justice and magnanimity and we have conjured
them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations
which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence
They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity
We must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our
Separation and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind Enemies in
War in Peace Friends

We therefore the Representatives of the United States of America in
General Congress Assembled appealing to the Supreme Judge of the
world for the rectitude of our intentions do in the Name and by the
Authority of the good People of these Colonies solemnly publish and
declare That these United Colonies are and of Right ought to be Free
and Independent States that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to
the British Crown and that all political connection between them and
the State of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved and
that as Free and Independent States they have full Power to levy War
conclude Peace contract Alliances establish Commerce and to do all
other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do And
for the support of this Declaration with a firm reliance on the
Protection of Divine Providence we mutually pledge to each other our
Lives our Fortunes and our sacred Honor




About this etext

The Declaration of Independence

The United States Declaration of Independence was the first Etext
released by Project Gutenberg early in 1971 The title was stored in
an emailed instruction set which required a tape or diskpack be hand
mounted for retrieval The diskpack was the size of a large cake in a
cake carrier cost 1500 and contained 5 megabytes of which this file
took 12 Two tape backups were kept plus one on paper tape The
10000 files we hope to have online by the end of 2001 should take
about 12 of a comparably priced drive in 2001

This file was never copyrighted Sharewared etc and is thus for all
to use and copy in any manner they choose Please feel free to make
your own edition using this as a base

In my research for creating this transcription of our first Etext I
have come across enough discrepancies even within that official
documentation provided by the United States to conclude that even
facsimiles of the Declaration of Indendence will NOT going to be all
the same as the original nor of other facsimiles There is a
plethora of variations in capitalization punctuation and even where
names appear on the documents which names I have left out

The resulting document has several misspellings removed from those
parchment facsimiles I used back in 1971 and which I should not be
able to easily find at this time including Brittain
