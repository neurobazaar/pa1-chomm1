Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a

Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

Janice Day The Young Homemaker

by Helen Beecher Long




CHAPTER I WHEN MOTHER WAS A GIRL

Why that is Arlo Junior What can he be doing out of doors so
early And look at those cats following him Did you ever
Janice Day stared wonderingly from her front bedroom window at
the boy crossing the street in the dim predawn light with a cat
and three halfgrown kittens gamboling about him Occasionally
Arlo Junior would shake something out of a paper to the ground
and the cats would immediately roll and frolic and slap playfully
at one another acting as the girl had never seen cats act
before

The pleasantly situated cottage belonging to Mr Broxton Day
stood almost directly across the way from the Arlo Weeks place
on Knight Street Therefore Janice often said that the days
and nights and weeks are very close together

Knight Street as level as the palm of ones hand led straight
into Greensboro where it crossed Market and Hammond Streets
making the Six Cornersactually the heart of the business
district of this thriving midwestern town

The Day cottage was a mile and a half from the Six Corners and
the Farmers  Merchants Bank in which Mr Broxton Day held an
important salaried position Besides his house and his situation
in the bank Mr Day considered another of his possessions very
important indeed although he did not list it when he made out
his tax return

This that he so highly valued possessed the very brightest hazel
eyes in the world wore a wealth of free brown hair in two plaits
over her shoulders and was of a slender figure without bordering
upon that unfortunate skinniness which nature abhors as she
does a vacuum

Janice possessed also even teeth that flashed when she smiled
and she smiled often a pink and white complexion that the sun
was bound to freckle if she was not careful and a cheerful
demure expression of countenance that went a long way toward
making her good to look upon if not actually good looking

In a spick and span bluechecked bungalow apron she stood at her
window just as Dawn swept a brush of partiallyhued color across
the eastern horizon Having had it in her mind when she went to
bed the night before to arise early she had of course awakened
long before it was really time to get up to make sure that daddy
for once got a proper breakfast

For the Days father and daughter were dependent on hired
service and such service in the form of Olga Cedarstrom was
about as incapable and stupid as fate had yet produced

Having caught the first glimpse of that mischievous youngster
Arlo Weeks Junior with the cats Janice raised her window
softly as far as the lower sash would go to peer out at the
strange procession The boy and the cats entered the Days side
gate and disappeared around the comer of the kitchen ell

Now what can that rascal be about If he does anything to
bother Olga there will be trouble And everything here goes
crossways enough now without Arlo Junior adding to it I
declare

Janice could very clearly remember when the cottage had been a
real home instead of just a place to stay for her mother had
been dead only a year The experiences of that year had been
trying both for the sorrowing widower and the girl who had been
her mothers close companion and confidant

Janice was old enough and well trained enough in domestic affairs
to have kept house very nicely for her father But she had to go
to school of course an education was the most important thing
in the world for her And the kind of help that came into the
Days kitchen often balked at being bossed by a slip of a
gurrrl as one recent incumbent of the position had said

Olga Cedarstrom was stupid and often cross in the morning and
she was careless and slatternly in her ways But she did not
object when Janice came down early to get her fathers breakfast
and serve it daintily as her mother had taught her

Only Olga could not be taught to do these things She did not
want to learn She said she had a fella and would be married
soon and under the circumstances she did not consider that she
needed to learn anything more about domestic work

Janice did not wish to go down into the kitchen so early for
that would awaken Olga who would come from her room blearyeyed
with sleep and with her temper at a sawtooth edge to ask why
she bane get oop in de middle of de night

Janice had washed and dressed and read her morning Bible chapter
which she always managed to find time for even when she did not
get up as early as on this occasion For her age and perhaps
because of her mothers death which still seemed recent to
Janice she was rather seriousminded Yet she was no prig and
she loved fun and was as alert for good times as any girl of her
age in Greensboro

The talk she had had overnight with daddy had perhaps put her in
a rather more serious mood than usual The talk had been all
about her mother and the hopes the mother and father had had and
the plans they had made for their little girls future

To carry through those plans necessitated the proper schooling of
Janice Day She was already in the upper grade of the grammar
school Even if the household affairs were all at sixes and at
sevens she must stick to her books for she had ambitions She
was quite sure she wanted to teach when she grew up

There was another reason that spurred Janice Day to the point of
early rising although daddy had not even hinted that he missed
the comfortable daintily served breakfasts which he used to
enjoy when Mrs Day was alive It was something he had said
about an entirely different matter that started this serious
train of thought in the girls mind

She had expressed herself as so many of us do when we are in
difficulties or when we see conditions we would like to have
changed Oh if things were only different

Broxton Day had looked at her with his head held sideways and a
quizzical smile in his eyes as well as on his lips

Different Do you want to know how to bring about a change Do
something Dont just talk or think or wonder or wish or
hope but do It is all right to say that good things become a
reality because somebody has a good thought Actually thinking
does not bring things about It is doing Do something in the
world my dear Dont wait for somebody else to set the example
or to lead Do what you can yourself while you are waiting for a
leader Do something

Of course thought must precede action and furthermore must
accompany action if action is not to run wild But in the end
thought must become action and we must all of uslittle girls
as well as adultsdo something if the conditions we do not like
are to be changed

That was really what had got Janice Day out of bed so early on
this morning Poor daddy He sometimes had most awful meals
served to him And the house was usually in a state of confusion
if it was not actually dirty

Olga had come straight from a peasant cottage in her

country and her idea of scrubbing the kitchen floor was to dash
pails of water over it and then sweep the water out of the back
door with a broom

There was a Swedish colony established around the pickle
factories on the northern edge of the town and Olga went over
there with her fella to a dance or downtown or to a picture
show almost every evening No wonder she was not fit for work in
the morning

When Janice had come up to bed the previous evening she had
brought with her the treasurebox which daddy usually kept in
the wall safe in the living room It contained certain heirlooms
and trinkets that had been her mothers and were now Janices
most sacred possessions

She had had to beg daddy for the treasurebox for he too
prized its contents beyond words But Janice was a careful girl
and daddy trusted her and he knew too that the mementoes of
her dead mother seemed to bring the woman closer to the little
daughter and so in the end he had allowed Janice to carry the
treasurebox to her room to be kept for the night but to be
returned to its usual place after the girl had had it by her and
looked at its contents for a while

There were a few pieces of jewelrymore valuable for their
associations than for their intrinsic worth the gold framed
photographs of Grandfather and Grandmother Avion which clasped
like a little book and the miniature of Janices mother painted
on ivory when she was a girl by a painter who had since become
very famous

This last was the girls dearest possessionthe memento of her
mother which she cared for above everything else Daddy had put
it into her keeping with a reverence that could not fail to
impress Janice Day young as she was Broxton Day had worshipped
his wife for her higher qualities as well as having loved her for
her human attributes

Something of this attitude toward his dead wife Janice young as
she was understood She knew for instance that there was no
other woman in the world as a mate for Broxton Day now that her
mother was gone All the more must she try therefore to fill
her mothers place in his life

She had taken the miniature out of the treasurebox and was
looking with dimming eyes at it by the window when shifting her
glance she had seen Arlo Weeks Junior crossing the street
This was her mother when she was a girl What a sweet demure
face it was Janice did not realize that much of the expression
of the countenance in this miniature was visualized in the flesh
in her own face

No wonder daddy had fallen in love with such a pretty pretty
girl So thought Janice Day And

What was Arlo Junior the mischievous torment of the
neighborhood doing with those cats This sudden query shattered
her dream completely She returned the miniature to the
treasurebox and closed and latched the cover

Goodness knows murmured Janice Day there are cats enough
around this house without Arlo Junior bringing any more upon the
premises Sometimes I hear them squalling and fighting when I
wake up in the night

With the treasurebox in her hand she opened her bedroom door
and crossed the hall to the storeroom The window of this room
was over the back porch She heard a step on the porch flooring
The door of the summer kitchen was seldom locked Was Arlo
Junior down there

That boy was constantly getting into trouble with the neighbors
There was a regular feud between Olga Cedarstrom and Arlo Junior
Olga had chased him half a block only the other day threatening
him with a broom

And the cats Here they came from all directionsover
the back yard fences and from the barn Fat cats lean cats
shabby ashbarrel cats and pet cats with ribbons and collars
Amazedly Janice Day owned to herself that she had never seen so
many cats gathered in a more or less harmonious group before

Instead of fighting or mauling they approached the back porch
of the Day house as though on pleasure bent Was that Arlo Junior
giggling down there

She put down the treasurebox and tried to open the window But
the sash stuck She distinctly heard the door below close and
footsteps receding from the porch

Wishing to make sure that it was Arlo Junior who had been below
the girl ran back to her bedroom Yes there he was scuttling
across the street in evident haste to get under cover

Now isnt that odd murmured Janice Suddenly a sound
floated up from belowan echoing wail that seemed wrenched from
the very soul of a tortured cat The cry reverberated through the
house in a most eerie fashion

Fortunately her father slept in the front of the house and there
was a closed door between the front and the back halls on both
floors But Janice heard Olgas big flat feet land upon the
floor almost instantly That feline wail had evidently brought
the Swedish girl out of her dreams all standing

That sound sent Janice out of the room on a run She must reach
the seat of trouble before Olga got to the place Otherwise the
trouble was bound to increase and becomewhat Even Janices
imagination trained as it was by the succession of incompetent
and unwilling kitchen helpers could not picture that

Before Janice Day could reach the hall Olga was padding down the
stairs to the kitchen From the rear arose increasing howls
The cats may have mysteriously gathered in apparent amity but so
many of them shut up in that outer kitchen with no escape could
not possibly dwell for long in harmony

There certainly was no harmony in these mounting wails The
principle motif seemed to be furnished by the cat that had first
voiced his complaint But now as Janice plunged down the stairs
after Olga the thin high scream of the initial feline chorister
was crossed in warp and woof by basset strains

The sounds rose and fell as though proceeding from cats in
tormentan agonizing oratorio like nothing Janice had ever heard
before She screamed to the Swedish girl but her voice was
drowned by the caterwauling in the back kitchen Olga wrenched
open the door Janice arriving to look over her shoulder at the
very moment she did so saw the back kitchen practically filled
with cats

When one cat loses its temper it seems as though every other cat
within hearing gets excited In the corners out of the way of
the battlefield kittens and tabbies were rolling and playing
upon the dried twigs and leaves that Janice knew must be catnip
that Arlo Junior had flung upon the floor to bait the cats into
the kitchen But the cats in the middle of the room were
preparing for the representation of a busy day at Donnebrook
Fair

Them cats In de clean kitchen what I scrubbed last night only
I bane kill them cats And there was not a cat in the lot as
mad as Olga Cedarstrom

There was a hod of coal beside her Olga seized the goodsized
lumps of stove coal one after another and began volleying with
a strong overhand throw at the excited animals

Olga proved to be an excellent shot She hit a cat with almost
every lump of coal she threw But she could not after all have
easily failed to do this there were so many cats in the kitchen

Oh dont Dont Olga Stop shrieked Janice You will hurt
them

Hurt them repeated the girl I bane mean to hurt dem and
slam went another lump of coal

But they cant get out gasped Janice

Den how dey get in huh demanded Olga and threw another lump
with terrific force

There was a howl higher and more bloodcurdling than any that
had heretofore assailed their ears One big cat scrambled up the
wall and up the window panes seeking an exit One of the
creatures legs dragged limply

Olga Cedarstrom shrieked Janice you have broken that poor
cats leg

I bane break all his legs rejoined this quite ferocious girl
How dese cats coom here I bane sure you know

She turned to glare at Janice Day so savagely a lump of coal
poised in her smutted hand that the girl was really frightened
She backed away from the angry woman

Then she thought of something she might do to save the cats and
the back kitchen from complete wreck Janice darted out of the
room to the porch In a moment she had unlatched the
summerkitchen door and flung it wide open

Instantly there boiled out of the room cats big and cats little
cats of all colors and every degree of fright One of the last
to escape was the poor cat with the broken leg There was
nothing Janice Day could do for it She did not dare to try to
touch it

She ventured back into the house to find Olga Cedarstrom still
breathing out threatenings and slaughter Olga was in her
nightgown and a wrapper She had not even stopped for slippers
when she came from her bed Now she padded to the back stairs
turning to shake her clenched fist at Janice and cry

I leave I leave I bane going to pack my troonk The man pay
me oop to last night and I leave

I am glad of it gasped Janice finding her voice again It
wasnt my fault and it wasnt the poor cats fault I am glad
you are going so there

But she became more serious as she prepared the nice breakfast
she had promised herself the night before her father should have
She heard Olga go to the telephone in the hall She called a
number and then talked in Swedish for several minutes to whoever
answered

Janices father came into the dining room just as his little
daughter brought in the breakfast When he saw the steaming
coffee pot and the covered dishes and toastrack his face
brightened But he had to be told of the domestic catastrophe
impending

Well he said cheerfully we couldnt get anybody any worse
than Olga that is sure I will see what they have at the
intelligence office and I may send a woman up after you get home
from school this afternoon Ill phone you first daughter I
dont have to see Olga do I She was paid last night

No Janice told him he need not bother about a servant who was
on the point of going Before it was time for Janice to leave
for school a taxicab appeared driven by a man of Olgas own
nationality He went upstairs for the girls trunk

This he shouldered and carried out to the cab Olga followed
him wearing the red hat with the green plume which had so amused
Janice when the Swedish girl had arrived She drove away in the
cab without even looking back at Janice Day

The latter had tidied up the kitchen and dining room The back
kitchen would have to remain as it was until later And Janice
felt that she would like to get hold of Arlo Weeks Junior and
make him clean up that kitchen

She changed to her school dress strapped together the books she
had studied the night before put on her hat and stood a moment
in the hall wondering if all would be right until she should
return at three oclock

And then for the first time and suddenly Janice remembered the
treasurebox

She darted upstairs to her bedroom How careless of her to have
left it there She knew the simple combination of the wall safe
in the living room and She determined to open the safe and put
the box away

But when she entered her bedroom she found that the treasurebox
was not there Instantly she remembered having taken it with her
when she ran into the storeroom to see what Arlo Junior was doing
with the cats

In trying to open the window in the storeroom she had set the box
down on a trunkon Olgas trunk

Startled indeed alarmed and shaking Janice Day went as fast as
she could to the storeroom Olgas trunk was gone She did not
see the treasurebox anywhere in the room

She searched the room diligently She ran from room to
roomOlgas her own even the other bedrooms She halted at
last in her own room sobbing and alarmed

The treasurebox was gone Olgas trunk had gone Olga herself
had gone

And the photographs of Grandfather and Grandmother Avion the
oldfashioned jewelry the diary her mother had kept as a little
girl the miniature Janice thought so much ofall all the
keepsakes her father had entrusted her with the night before
seemed to have gone With Olga and the trunk



CHAPTER II THE HUNT FOR THE TREASUREBOX

This was a very tragic happening in Janice Days life She had
never been regardless of important matters that was why daddy
had not even warned her to be careful of the treasurebox

He assumed that she would consider its precious contents and
guard it accordingly Why He had not even mentioned it this
morning he had been so confident of her good sense

And because of Arlo Junior and a bunch of cats she had forgotten
all about her mothers miniature and all the other heirlooms in
the treasurebox Her tears were those of anger at herself as
well as sorrow because of the disappearance of the heirlooms
Yet at the moment she did not fully appreciate the full weight of
the happening

Janice could not stand and cry about it She had assured herself
that the treasurebox was not where she had left itwas not in
the storeroom at all as far as she could see Olga certainly
had not picked it up and placed it in any of the rooms on this
second floor or anywhere else where it could be easily seen

Janice could only believe that the Swedish girl either by
intention or in some involuntary way had carried the
treasurebox off with her Yet it did not seem as though Olga
Cedarstrom bad temper and all could be a thief That was an
awful thought

Maybe she has done it to plague me Janice thought She is
awfully mad at me She thought it was my fault that the cats got
into the back kitchen And now she means to pay me back She
means to return it

But where has she gone And what shall I do were the final
queries formed in Janice Days mind

She must not stand idle It was nearing school time Nor could
she neglect the matter until she came home from school at three
oclock If Olga Cedarstrom were really dishonest she might be
getting farther and farther away from Greensboro while Janice
remained inactive

She must do something

Janice went slowly downstairs First Of all it was her duty to
communicate with her father at the bank She hated to tell him
of this happening for she realized keenly her fault in the
matter But not for a moment did the girl consider hiding the
unfortunate affair from Broxton Day

She went to the telephone and called the bank When she asked for
Mr Day She could almost see him taking the receiver from the
hook when the bell on his telephone rang

Yes Daddys voice sounded clearly and courteously over the
wire This is Day

Often when he said this over the telephone Janice would respond
giggling And this is KnightStreet Number eightfortyfive

But she did not feel at all like joking on this occasion All in
a rush she told him of the tragic happening

And I dont know what to do Daddy was the way in which she
ended her story

Even over the telephone the girl realized that her father was
more startled than she expected him to be His voice did not
sound at all natural as he asked

Do you mean to tell me that everything that was in that box is
lost Janice Everything

Oh Daddy choked the girl I put everything back before I
closed the boxmammas picture and her diary and all

There were other things

Oh yes The jewelry and the photographs said Janice

More than those her fathers hoarse voice said quickly I
cannot explain to you now my child Didnt you know there was a
false bottom in that box

A false bottom to the treasurebox Daddy she cried
wonderingly A secret compartment

Oh I didnt know

No of course not I blame myself my dear he added and she
knew that he was striving to control his voice Do not cry any
more I will explain when come home

Oh Daddy

Are you sure you have looked carefully for the box and he now
spoke more moderately

Oh yes Daddy

Looked everywhere

Indeed I have

Then daughter by the face of the clock in front of me I
advise you to hurry away to school I will see what can be done
You say Olga went away in a taxicab

Yes Daddy

Of course you did not notice the number of the car

Oh no sir But the man was a Swede like Olga And he came in
and carried down her trunk 

I will see what can be done Go to school like a good girl and
do not let anxiety spoil your recitations Goodbye

He hung up the receiver and Janice followed his example There
seemed nothing else she could do

She would have been late for school had not Stella Latham driven
by the Day cottage in her fathers car just as Janice came out
Stella lived some distance out of town her father being a
welltodo farmer and she was driven in daily by either her
brother or one of the farm hands

Janice saw the automobile coming in the distance and soon
recognized the Latham car

Dear me she sighed I hope Stella will not turn down Hester
Street If she comes this far shell be sure to ask me to ride
and then I can get to school on time

With rather anxious eyes Janice watched the oncoming car Yes
it passed Hester Street and came on down Knight Street to make a
later turn off toward the schoolhouse The car almost shot past
Janice before the girl inside saw her on the sidewalk Then the
girl suddenly leaned out of the swiftly moving car

Oh Janice Day screamed Stella warning her driver to stop
with one hand while she beckoned to Janice with the other
Hurry Youll be late Get in here

Janice ran after the car glad of the lift Stella was a buxom
girl a year or two older than Janice but in the latters grade
at school Ever so nice Janice thought her But Janice
thought most of her school friends were nice She was friendly
toward them so they had no reason to be otherwise than kind to
her

Not that Janice Day was either nambypamby or stupid She had
opinions and expressed them frankly and she possessed a strong
will of her own But she not to hurt other peoples feelings
and if she stood up for her opinions she usually did so without
antagonizing anybody

Youre just the girl I wanted to see anyway Janice before
school Stella said as the younger girl hopped into the tonneau
and the chauffeur let in the clutch again

Now you seeall of me said Janice brightly trying to put the
trouble of the lost treasurebox behind her

Her eyelids were just a little red and she took one more long
sobbing breath But Stella was so very much interested in her
own affairs that she noticed nothing at all strange about her
friend

Oh Janice Stella said Im to have a birthday party You
know I told you all about it before Yes Stella you told
me agreed Janice

Of course I did And I want you to come I couldnt really
have a party without you Janice But I am not so sure about
some of the girls

Oh dear me murmured Janice If I was going to have a
regular party Id invite all the girls in our classor else none
at all

Now thats just like you You always are so quick How did you
know I didnt want to invite her complained Stella pouting

I didnt know Whom do you mean to leave out Janice asked
smiling

There Thats what my mother says You are always so shrewd and
sly

Oh cried Janice not at all pleased does your mother think I
am sly

Weell she said you were shrewd admitted Stella changing
color Now dont get mad Janice Day I want you to help me

You go about it in a funny way said Janice rather piqued I
am not sly enough to be of any use to you I guess

Now dont be angry wailed the other girl What I mean is
that you always see through things and can get out of
difficulties

I didnt know I got into difficultiesnot many anyway Janice
added with a little sigh

Dear me Janice dont split hairsplease said the very
selfish and selfcentered Stella I want your help Do tell me
how to get out of asking that girl to my party without offending
her friendsfor she has got friends curiously enough

For goodness sake gasped Janice What girl do you wish to
snub Stella

There you go with your nasty insinuations exclaimed Stella
whiningly I dont want to snub anybody But some people are
impossible

Meaning me Janice asked with twinkling eyes

Of course not Why will you so misunderstand me I wouldnt
snub you Janice Day I am speaking of Amy Carringford

Oh It is Amy you wish to snub is it Janice said with a
change of tone

Even Stella noted the change She seized Janices arm

Now dont You made me say that I dont really want to snub
her I dont want to hurt her feelings But of course I cant
have those pauper children at my partyAmy and Gummy Gummy
What a frightful name And his pants are patched at the knees
They wouldnteither of themhave a decent thing to wear of
course

Janice said nothing for a long minute Stellas blue eyes which
were actually more staring than pretty began to cloud ominously
Instinctively she sensed that Janice was not with her in this

Amy Carringford is a nice girl I think Janice Day said
mildly And perhaps she has a party dress Stella

There you go Always standing up for anything mean or common
stormed Stella I might have known you wouldnt help me

Why did you ask me then Janice inquired with some rising
spirit

Because youre always so sharp about things and you can help me
if you want to

Stella Latham was certainly much more frankly spoken than
politic Janice Day excused her schoolmate to a degree She
usually found excuses for every one but herself

I was only trying to help you Janice said slowly you havent
really anything against Amy have you

Shes a paupera regular pauper

Why thats not so interrupted Janice A pauper must be one
who is supported at the public expense We had that word only
the other day in our lesson you know Stella And Amy
Carringfordor her folks arent like that

Nobody knows what or who they are Theyve only just come here
and from goodness knows where And they live in that little
tumbledown house in Mullen Lane and

Oh dear me Stella interrupted Janice with a sudden laugh
That list of crimes will never send anybody to jail You are
awfully critical Amy has awfully pretty manners and just
wonderful hair She sings and dances well too And
GummyGumswith is his full name

Gumswith Fancy ejaculated the farmers critical

daughter

Yes isnt it awful returned Janice Anybody would be sorry
for a boy with such a name And he hasnt even a middle one they
can call him by You know it isnt his fault Stella that he
has such a horrid name

No I dont suppose it is But

And Amy is so nice She is just about my size Stella and if
you promise never to tell

What is it A secret eagerly demanded Stella as Janice
hesitated

Yes Or it will be a secret if you promise

Cross my heart Janice declared Stella who loved secrets

Wellnow said Janice Day most seriously if you invite Amy
and she cant come because she hasnt any party dress Ill lend
her one of mine that was made for me just before my mother died
I am wearing only black and white Ive outgrown those new
dresses that were made for me then I guess And Amy is just a
weeny bit smaller than I am

But Janice Day youyoure helping Amy Carringford Youre not
helping me at all

Why yes I am helping you said Janice warmly At least I am
trying to If you will invite Amy with the rest of us girls
Ill see that she has a party dress I should think that was
helping you a whole lot Stella Latham You said you didnt want
to hurt her feelings

The car reached the schoolhouse Janice was out of it like a
flash with her schoolbooks and lunch The bell was tolling

Now isnt that just like Janice Day grumbled Stella
following her from the automobile She is a sly little thing

Mr Broxton Day felt much more troubled than Janice possibly
could feel about the disappearance of the treasurebox and the
keepsakes it contained Intrinsically the value of the articles
that she named was not very great although nothing could replace
the diary or the miniature of his dead wife But as he had
intimated to Janice over the telephone there was something else
There was that lost with the socalled treasurebox that meant
more to him than the mementoes his daughter had known about

During this lonely year that had passed since his wifes death
Mr Days experiences with domestic help had been disheartening
as well as varied

Olga Cedarstrom had been with them two months She had come
rather better recommended than some of her predecessors Instead
of obtaining her services through an agency Mr Day had found
her in Pickletown as the hamlet at the pickle works was
called

There Olga recently arrived in Greensboro had been living with
friends Mr Day went over there first of all to search for the
girl

But her whilom friends knew nothing about Olga since the previous
evening They did not know that she contemplated leaving Mr
Day And she had not appeared at Pickletown after she had
departed from eight hundred and fortyfive Knight Street that
morning

Mr Day did not wish to put the police on the trail of the absent
Olga In the first place there was no real evidence that the
Swedish girl had stolen the box of mementoes

If she had taken them at all she must have done so just to pique
Janice not understanding how really valuable the contents of the
box were If possible Mr Day wished to recover the lost box
without the publicity of going to the police both for Olgas
sake and for his own

And then as Janice had told him the taxicab driver had been in
the house He had gone upstairs to the storeroom for Olgas
trunkto the very room in which Janice had last seen the
treasurebox

It might be that the driver was the person guilty of taking the
box Olga might know nothing about it Yet her disappearance
without informing her friends of her intention to leave
Greensboro looked suspicious

Mr Day had to search further He had two other persons to
discover One was Olgas fella the other was the Swedish
taxicab driver

From people who knew Olga around the pickle factories it was easy
to learn that Olgas friend was a hard working and estimable
young man named Willie Sangreen Just at this time Willie was
away from home They could tell Mr Day nothing about Willies
absence either at his boardinghouse or where he was employed
But in both instances they were sure Willie would be back

In hunting for the Swedish taxicab driver Mr Day had even less
good fortune There were two taxicab companies in Greensboro and
less than a dozen independent owners of cabs Before noon he had
learned beyond peradventure that there was not a cab driver in
town of Swedish nationality

He presumed that the cab must have come from out of town Where
it had come from and where it had gone with Olga and Olgas
trunk and possibly with the treasurebox seemed a mystery
insolvable

If Olga or the cab driver had stolen the box of heirlooms it
seemed that all trace of their whereabouts had been skillfully
covered



CHAPTER III DELIA

In spite of her anxiety Janice fixed her mind upon her
recitations with her usual success During the past few months
so many many things had happened to trouble the home pool that
the girl was pretty well used to seeing it ruffled

Help came and went at the Day cottage on Knight Street in a
procession of incompetents Some incumbents of the domestic
situation remained but a week Olga Cedarstrom had been longer
than any in Mr Days employ

Often when they were without a girl Janice had spent her
Saturday holiday trying to clean house and set things to rights
and when daddy had come home from the bank he had donned a
kitchen apron and helped

The house was by no means kept as it had been when Mrs Day was
alive For she had been a trained housewife and she knew how to
make the domestic help do the work properly

Now there was dust under the furniture and in the corners Pots
and pans were grimy Because of the rough methods of cleaning
pursued by Olga the baseboards of the kitchen were streaked with
a hightide mark of soapy water

The stove and the gas range were smeared with grease Scarcely a
cooking utensil but was sticky The silver went unpolished The
yolk of egg the very stickingest thing there was Janice
declared could be found on the edges of plates and spoons

And the laundry The wet wash the flat work laundry and
the complete service laundry were all only a little worse than
the attempts of the hired help to wash clothes properly

Bed and table linen wore out twice as fast as it should Janice
knew Nobody would wash and turn socks and stockings as they
should be washed and turned Fruit stains were never removed

Either the girls used kerosene in boiling the clothes and the
odor of it clung to them even after they were laid away in the
bureau drawers or she threw chloride of lime into the water
which ate holes in the various fabrics Mother used to make
Javelle water to whiten the clothes but Janice did not know how
it was made nor had she time to make it

Indeed with schoolclosing in the offing and lessons and
examinations getting harder and harder the girl scarcely had
time to keep her own clothing neat and mended She knew that
right now daddy was wearing socks with holes in them

So when her mind was not fixed upon her lessons it was not
likely that even Stella Lathams birthday party occupied much of
Janices thought She started home from school as soon as she
was released considering if she could get the back kitchen
cleaned up before it was time to get supper for daddy The lumps
of soft coal Olga Cedarstrom had thrown at the cats had made an
awful mess of the place Janice very well knew

As she turned the corner into Knight Street there was Arlo Weeks
Junior just ahead of her Arlo Junior the cause of the
mornings trouble Arlo Junior the cause of Olgas leaving the
Days in the lurch More Arlo Junior who was the spring of
Janice Days deeper trouble for if it had not been for that
mischievous wight Olga Cedarstrom could not have run off with
the treasurebox

Arlo Junior had black curly hair like his father He had
snapping brown eyes too and was quick and nervous in his
movements Of all the Weeks children Daddy said there was a
raft of them Arlo Junior was the worst behaved He was
forever in trouble

To report him to his parents was just like shooting cannon balls
into a stack of feathers His mother tall cadaverous and of
complaining voice and manner only declared

Hes too much for me I tell Arlo that Junior ought to be
locked up or handcuffed or something And thats all the good
it does

To complain to Mr Weeks of his namesake was quite as
unsatisfactory

What The young rascal Mr Weeks would emphatically say
Arlo did that Well I tell you what If you catch him at any
of his tricks you thrash him Thats what you dothrash him
You have my full permission to punish him as though he were your
own boy Thats the only way to deal with a rascal like him

So you see both parents shed responsibility both for Arlo
Juniors mischief and punishment just as easily as a duck sheds
rainwater Under these circumstances

Arlo Junior usually went without punishment no matter what he
did

And here he was swaggering along the walk with some of his
mates hilariously telling them perhaps of how he had tolled
all the cats of the neighborhood into the Days back kitchen

Janice Day was a very human girl indeed The thought of Juniors
trick and all it had brought about made her very very angry
She rushed right into the group of boys all fully as big as she
was soundly boxed Arlo Weeks ears and just as many times as
she could do so before he outran her and left her panting and
still wrathful on the curb

The other boys backed away leaving Arlo Junior to fight his own
battleor run if that seemed to him the part of wisdom as
evidently it had

I hope that will teach you to bring cats into our kitchen Arlo
Junior Janice cried after him

No twont declared the boy rubbing the ear that had
received the greater number of her blows I knew how to do it
before didnt I My Janice Day but you can slam a fella

I wish I could hurt you more declared the girl Youve made
me enough trouble

She marched on leaving the scattered crowd of urchins to gather
again about Arlo Junior but now in a scoffing rather than in an
admiring crowd The bubble of Arlo Juniors conceit had been
punctured He had been whipped by a girl

Now thought Janice as she went along home I would not want
Daddy to know I did that Fighting a boy on the street I guess
Miss Peckham who is always peering through her blinds at what I
do if she had seen me would be sure to say I was misbehaving
because I had no mother to make me mind As though I wouldnt
behave just as well for Daddy as I used to for dear mother

Only I havent really behaved very well today she went on
reviewing the matter to herself I dont care Yes I do too
No matter what Arlo Weeks Junior did I oughtnt to have fought
him on the street like that Oh dear mused the girl I dont
know whether I am sorry I hit Arlo Junior or am sorry that Im
not sorry Its awfully confusing

She choked back a sob dashed the tears from her eyes and
suddenly saw that the hazy object she had been looking at for the
past minute was really a human figure squatting on the side porch
steps of the Days cottage

Why who can that be thought Janice Day staring with all her
might at the oddlooking creature perched thus on the steps with
a bulging oldfashioned black oilcloth bag beside her

It was a woman in a cheap homemade calico dress and with rows
upon rows of flounces on the skirt She sat on the
nexttothetop step of the porch while her shoes were planted
flatfooted on the walk She was very shortwaisted while her
limbs accentuated by the model of the flounced skirt seemed
enormously long

Indeed she looked like the halves of two people mysteriously
glued together Her nether limbs without doubt belonged to a
giantess her body although broad and sturdy was almost
dwarflike Her arms were very short

Above this strange figure was a fat babylike face with
staring lightblue eyes and whisps of strawcolored hair laid
flat to her head under a close fitting hat

Its another one groaned Janice her heart sinking I know
she must be from the intelligence office becausewellshe
looks so unintelligent I
 guess

Janice opened the gate and approached the ungainly woman
doubtfully Surely daddy could not have seen her before hiring
this very peculiarlooking person He must have accepted her
services over the telephone and sight unseen

The newly hired girl wreathed her flabby face in a vacuous smile
She bobbed up from her seat bringing the oilcloth bag with her
and towering over Janice Day in a most startling manner

Howdedo I guess you are after bein Mr Days little girl
heh

The voice from the giantess made Janice jump It was high and
squealing like a bats voice and some peoples ears are not
attuned to the bats cry and cannot hear it at all

Yees I am Janice Day admitted the girl

Well squealed the newcomer Im the lady your paw sent up to
do the work Youre a right pretty little girl aint you

Janice ignored this bit of flattery as she mounted the steps and
drew forth the door key

What is your name please she asked the woman

Why Ill tell you said the other in a most confidential tone
blundering up the steps after Janice and stooping to get her lips
near the girls ear My real name is Mrs Bridget Burns but my
friends all call me Delia I dont like Bridget Would you
mind callin me Delia or else Mrs Burns heh

I think father would prefer to call you by your first name
Janice said trying not to show her surprise and amusement We
will call you Delia if that pleases you

Youre a real nice little girl I can see that said Delia
with a huge sigh of satisfaction following Janice bag and all
into the house

Janice led the way up the back stairs to the girls room It was
just as Olga had left itas untidy and mussed up as ever a
room was

Delia uttered a high nasal ejaculation I guess your last girl
wasnt very clean she said Who was she

She was a Swede Janice replied wearily

Heh Them Swedes sniffed Delia voicing a pronounced national
prejudice

She left in a hurry Janice explained Sheshe got mad One
of the neighbors boys played a trick on her and she left

Ye dont be tellin me Couldnt she spank the boy Sure tis
no sinse them foreigners has

I hope you will not take offense so easily Janice rejoined
Here is clean linen for your bed We send the flat work to the
laundry There is a broom and carpet sweeper in the storeroom
and plenty of dust cloths You would better put your own room in
order first Then you can come down and I will show you about
getting dinner

Sure you is very young to be so knowin about housework Is
your mother dead

Yes

I didnt know but shed gone off and left you and your

paw observed this strange creature So many of them bes doin
that now

Oh gasped the girl

So thats why your paw did the hirin through Murphys Agency
Well I like to work where theres no lady boss said Delia
You and me is goin to get on fine

Janice wondered if that were so In no very enthusiastic frame
of mind she descended the stairs to put away her hat and coat
and to place her books on the table in the living room



CHAPTER IV MORE TROUBLES THAN ONE

Janice dreaded to have this new houseworker look into that back
kitchen and see its condition What Olga had done with the soft
coal ammunition was enough to make Delia depart before she had
even taken up her new duties

Yet Janice shrank from cleaning the room herself She had a lot
of home work to do for school and she would have to show the new
girl too just where everything was kept and what was expected
of her

Fortunately the dinnergetting would be a simple matter There
was a roast already prepared for the oven potatoes and another
vegetable and a salad The latter were in the house Olga had
been no dessert maker but there were canned pears in the
refrigerator and some bakers cake Daddy called it sweetened
sawdust in the cupboard

The girl would have to be told about these things Fortunately
they had not begun to use the summer kitchen as yet It was true
that Olga had only the day before cleaned the place as well as
she knew how in preparation for the approaching warm weather

But to put things to rights in that room again and to remove all
traces of the bombardment of the cats would take half a day or
more And Janice Day shrank from the use of the scrubbing brush
and strong sodawater

She decided that the back kitchen could not be cleaned this
afternoon She put on her bungalow apron and took the salad from
the icebox where it had lain on the ice in a cheesecloth bag
She usually prepared the salad herself for daddy was fond of it
and most of the itinerant help they had had considered grass
only fit for horses and cows

She was decanting the oil drop by drop into the salad dressing
when Delia appeared in the kitchen There was one good point
about the giantess her face and hands looked as though they were
familiar with soap and water She had removed the ruffled
monstrosity and had put on a more simple frock It did not serve
to make her look less ungainly but nevertheless it likewise
was clean

Are you doing the cooking asked the new incumbent her weak
squeaky voice quite above high C An do I help you

I am fixing the salad because my father likes it prepared in a
certain way I will show you what else there is to do Delia

Janice spoke in rather a grownup way because she had had so much
experience with a class of houseworkers only too willing to take
advantage of her youth and inexperience

Isnt that nice sighed Delia with her rather foolish smile

Janice wondered whether the woman was making fun of her or if
she was quite as silly as she appeared But if Delia would only
do the work and do it halfway right Janice told herself she did
not care if Delia was actually an idiot At least the new girl
seemed goodnatured

And she was not all thumbs But Janice stuffed the end of a
kitchen towel into her mouth more than once to stifle her giggles
when she chanced to think Of how daddy would look when he caught
his first glimpse of the gigantic Delia

When the vegetables were peeled and on the stove and the roast
was cooking in the covered roaster Janice led Delia through the
lower part of the house She tried to explain what there was to
do on the morrow when Delia would be alone all day with daddy at
business and herself at school

Yes maam said Delia after each item was explained And
then what do I do

Her vacant face advertised to all beholders that she promptly
forgot what she was told One particular formula for work drove
the previously explained item immediately out of Delias head

Isnt it a nice house was her final whistling comment as they
came back to the kitchen And where does this door lead

She opened the back kitchen door She stared at the
coallittered floor at the streaked and smutted walls at the
overturned chairs and a broken flowerpot or two that had come to
ruin during the bombardment

Sure whativer struck the place asked Delia in her high
squeaking voice What happened

Janice told her Delia shook her head and slowly closed the
doorslowly but firmly If folks will hire them Swedes tis
all they can expect was her comment

There was a finality to this that was uncanny Janice became
sure right then and there that Mrs Bridget Burns would never
clear up the wreck Olga Cedarstrom had made of the back kitchen
The girl wished with all her heart that she had boxed Arlo
Juniors ears harder

Miss Peckham her sharp chin hung upon the top rail of the
boundary fence called Janice just before daddy came home As
the Day house was on the corner of Love Street Miss Peckham was
the nearest neighbor

She was a weazened little woman with very sharp black eyes who
had assumed the censorship of the neighborhood years before
Living alone with her cats and Ambrose her parrot Miss Peckham
rigidly adhered to the harshest precepts of spinsterhood

Even Janice could understand that Miss Peckham considered daddy
not at all fit to bring up or have the sole care of a daughter
and that Mr Broxton Day was not to be altogether trusted

Miss Peckhams nature overflowed with tenderness toward animals
and it was regarding one of her pets she now called to Janice
about

You havent seen him have you Janice You havent seen my
Sam

Your Sam murmured Janice rather nonplussed for the moment
You dont mean the dog you bought of the butcher do you Miss
Peckham

No indeed Thats Cicero But Sam the cat Hes got black
and yellow on him Janice Youve seen him I know

And suddenly Janice remembered that she had seen him He had been
one of those cats tolled into the back kitchen by Arlo Junior
Worse than all Sam was the cat Olga Cedarstrom had hurt with a
lump of coal She remembered that he was the last to escape when
she opened the kitchen door dragging his injured leg behind him

How could Janice tell her of this awful thing that had happened
to Sam The poor cat had probably dragged himself off into some
secret place to lick his wounds to die perhaps

Youve seen him I know you have Janice Day cried the shrewd
maiden lady What have you done to poor Sam

Why Miss Peckham I havent done a thing to him declared
Janice

Miss Peckham however had read the girls face aright She saw
that Janice knew something about the missing cat

You tell me what you know she stormed her clawlike hands
shaking the top rail of the fence I wouldnt trust none of you
young ones in this neighborhood You are always up to some
capers

But really honestly I havent done a thing to your Sam
Janice said shrinking from telling all she knew about the
injured animal

You know where he is Miss Peckham accused

Oh I dont either

When did you see him last probed the other sharply

Thisthis morning

What time this morning
 Before breakfast Early gasped Janice wondering what she
would say next

Humph Something funny about the way you answer said the
suspicious spinster where was Sam when you saw him that
early

Running across our back yard Janice gasped telling the exact
truthbut no more

Ha exploded the other What made him run

After all Janice Day did not want to tell on Arlo Junior
Arlo Junior was the child of all others in the neighborhood whom
Miss Peckham carried on guerrilla warfare with She had
threatened to go to the police station and have Arlo Junior
locked up the very next time he crossed her path in a mischievous
way

Janice knew that Miss Peckham was a very active member of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and if she knew
that Arlo Junior had been in any way connected with Sams injury
she would be all the more bitter toward the young rascal

And really after all it was Olga Cedarstrom who had hurt the
cat But to tell Miss Peckham that and how it all came about
would do little to pacify the spinster So Janice kept silent
It seemed to her that she had gone about as far in the path of
deceit as she could go

You saw him running what made him run repeated Miss Peckham

Hehe was frightened I guess Miss Peckham There were other
cats It was early this morning before anybody else was up
around here The cats all ran out of our yard

And I warrant youd done something to make em run declared
the tarttongued neighbor Oh I know all you young ones around
here You aint no better than the rest of em Janice Day

Oh Miss Peckham murmured the girl

And if I find out that you done something outrageous to those
catsto my Sam speciallyitll be the sorriest day of your
life Now you see if tisnt

She turned and flounced into her house Janice came slowly back
to the kitchen door where she found the new houseworker frankly
listening

Guess shes a sharper aint she squeaked the woman Well I
wont tell her bout the cats in the back kitchen But o
course if folks will hire them Swede



CHAPTER V FATHER AND DAUGHTER

It did seem to Janice Day at this time as though trouble after
trouble was being heaped upon her young shoulders Miss Peckham
and her search for her Sam was of course a small matter
compared to the loss of the treasurebox and the heirlooms in it

Janice waited eagerly for daddy to come home and report on this
matter and his report when he did come sunk Janices heart
fathoms deep in an ocean of despair

Oh Daddy it cant be she cried sobbing against his coat
sleeve in the hall Olga wouldnt be so wicked How could
she

It is pretty sure that she has left town and has left no address
behind her It looks as though she had deliberately tried to
efface herself from the community said Mr Broxton Day slowly
Are you sure Janice that the box cannot be found

Oh Daddy Ive looked everywhere Dear Mammas picture that I
loved so much And her diary I

More than that daughter more than that said her father his
own voice breaking I should have been more careful about
allowing you to take the box There was something else

Oh Daddy what I didnt know there was a secret compartment
in the treasurebox she added wonderingly

You would scarcely understand my dear he told her with a
heavy sigh It was but a shallow place There were letters in
itletters which I treasured above everything else in the box
Letters your Mamma wrote me before you were born when I was away
from home and she thought she might never see me again We were
young then my dear and we loved each other very much

His voice trailed away into silence The girl young as she was
was awed by his grief She suddenly realized that her own sorrow
over the lost treasurebox was shallow indeed beside her fathers
despair

It was some time later that she told him just how well she had
searched for the missing box She narrated too all the
particulars of the early morning cat episode and the trouble
brought about by the mischiefloving Arlo Junior which she had
been unable to tell him earlier in the day

It would seem then Mr Day observed not unamused by the
account of the neighbors boys practical joke that if Olga
took the box it was on the spur of the moment She certainly had
not planned to leave us but lost her temper and went because she
was in a rage

Yes sir I suppose so admitted Janice And she was mad at
me too I could see she thought I had shut the cats in the back
kitchen

Yet Olgas going said Mr Broxton Day still thoughtfully
was skillfully plannedjust as though she had everything
arranged for it before the row this morning Dont just
understand that

Oh Daddy You dont suppose Olga was one of those awful crooks
we read of in the papers

Mr Broxton threw back his head and laughed in his very heartiest
fashion

Whatever else she was he said finally I dont think she was
a lady buccaneer Olga Cedarstrom appeared to be almost as
stupid a person as I ever saw But she was bad temperedno doubt
of that

Yes Daddy her disposition was not very sweet

admitted Janice with a sigh

But it looks queer her father pursued Sending for an
outoftown taxi and all I say daughter which way did it
drive

The taxicab

Yes

Toward town Daddy Right along Knight Street

Humph might have gone right through town and taken the Napsburg
pike Yet they could have turned off at Joyce Street and got
into the Dover pike Or gone to Clewitt or Preston Oh well
finished Broxton Day that cab could have come from and
returned to any one of a dozen places within a few miles of
Greensboro

But how do you know she was not driven right to the railroad
station as long as you are sure she did not go to Pickletown

I found out said Mr Day quietly that there isnt a Swede in
town who drives a taxi And you say the driver was a Swede and
that it was a regular taxicab

Oh yes Daddy He was one of her own kind of folks I heard
them talking together when he went up for her trunk I wish I
had taken the number of that cab cried Janice woefully

Never mind Dont blame yourself too harshly girly

But I do blame myself Daddy she cried wiping her eyes
Those dear pictures and the diary And most of all mothers
miniature Why Daddy Day Id give a million dollars rather
than have lost the treasurebox

No use crying over the spilled milk he said reflectively
It does seem to me as though Olga was not just the sort of
person who would stealI say You told me she telephoned for the
taxi

 Yes At least she telephoned and talked to somebody over the
phone in Swedish

You dont say repeated Mr Day thoughtfully using a Yankeeism
that betrayed his birthplace if nothing else did although he had
long since come from New England to the Middle West Then in
all probability she telephoned to a friend and the friend sent
the taxicab I wonder if that Willie Sangreen is in this

I tell you he exclaimed finally In the morning I will go
and see the superintendent of our telephone exchange personally
Perhaps when I explain the case he will tell me the number Olga
called up

Oh Daddy can you do that

There is a record made of every call he told her Now dont
worry more than you can help Janice Well do something about
it Never fear

His encouraging do something was bound to cheer his little
daughter She hurried away to see if dinner was not ready and
caught Delia frankly listening at the door

Why Delia why didnt you knock or speak Janice asked

But Delia was absolutely unruffled She drawled

I didnt know but you wanted to talk to your Paw some more and
the dinner could wait

When a little later they were seated at table and Delia
appeared with the first hot dishes it must be confessed that her
appearance somewhat startled Mr Broxton Day

Their anxiety about the lost treasurebox had precluded his
having asked any questions regarding the new houseworker her
appearance was as startling as though she had come straight from
a sideshow

Janice put her napkin to her lips to hide their trembling But
her eyes danced Daddys amazement was quickly smothered He
was silent however until Delia was out of the room again

What do you think of her Daddy giggled the little girl

I certainly did not see her before hiring her In fact I did
my business over the phone with the manager of the intelligence
office I gathered from him that

she was a woman of middle age and settled whatever that may
mean If it means that she can work and stay settled here But
what a queer looking creature How does she seem to take hold
Janice Does she seem intelligent

I havent made up my mind yet murmured his little daughter
She doesnt look as though she knew anything at all But maybe
she does You said yourself that we couldnt have anybody worse
than Olga

I dont know about that he retorted I may have to take that
back Sh Here she comes again

Aside from the fact that she served cold plates for the roast and
vegetables and hot ones for the salad that from her great
height she was almost certain to spill food on the table before
she got a dish set down before them and that she kept bouncing
in and out of the dining room to ask them if they were ready for
dessert she managed to get through the meal without making Mr
Day and Janice any great discomfort

In the living room later when Mr Day was in his comfortable
chair and Janice had her school books spread out upon the table
under the reading lamp the father said softly

Well my dear it is not the sort of life I hoped we would lead
when we built this house Your dear mother was such a wonderful
housekeeper and could manage so well I never had a thought or
a care about the housekeeping affairs But now

I know Daddy broke in Janice earnestly If only I didnt
have to go to school

That is something that cannot even be discussed he rejoined
smiling at her gravely As I told you last night my dear what
your mother and I planned regarding your education must be
carried through if possible

But college is a long way ahead said Janice wistfully And
meanwhile you are not comfortable and the house is going to rack
and ruin just as Miss Peckham says

Did the old girl say that he wanted to know with rather a
rueful smile on his lips

 Yes She was in here the other day and she is so nosey She
was bound to go all through house although I did not want her
to I know it doesnt look spick and span as it should

That is not your fault Janice her father said quickly
Dont let it worry you You must stick to your books And if
we can get nobody better than this womanor Olgato help we
must expect things to be in rather bad shape about the house

I suppose there are good housekeepers for hiresomewhere
They certainly do not seem to be in Greensboro And then I
cannot afford to pay a very high wage You see my dear we are
not rich

No Daddy Janice agreed I quite know that But we have
enough and to spare I am sure

So far we have managed to pull along he said smiling at her
quizzically And perhaps we shall be even better off in time
I am up to my neck as the boys say in an investment in Mexican
mines I was able to get into it before your dear mother died
and she quite approved Several Greensboro men have invested in
the same string of mines and there is ore being got outore of
good quality

But thus far there have been no dividends Rather we have had
to put in more money for improvements But when once we get
started producing you and I may have something like riches

Oh wont that be nice Daddy she exclaimed wideeyed and
redcheeked in her excitement To be really rich

Well we shall be able to engage somebody better fitted perhaps
for the position of housekeeper sighed Mr Day turning to his
newspaper again

Thats all right Daddy she said But meanwhile I am going
to do all I can to make things go smoother Just as you said last
night it can only be brought about by somebodys doing
something Ill do something you see if I dont

She made this declaration cheerfully But when she closed her
books kissed daddy and went up to bed her countenance was
overcast with an expression far from cheerful

Only the evening before she had sat here and looked her treasures
over The diary which mother had kept when she was a little
girlall the innocent little secrets she had written on the
pages which Janice so delighted to read

And the lovely miniature with mother in the very dress she wore
the evening she and Broxton Day were betrothed Janice knew all
about that Her mother had talked freely of her courtship and of
what a splendid young man daddy had appeared to be in her eyes

Her mothers frequently expressed admiration for the young man
who came from New England to win his fortune in the Middle West
was doubtless the foundation of Janice Days unusual fondness for
her father

That by her carelessness she should have brought about the loss
of the treasurebox and those things which both she and daddy
considered of such personal value was the thought that weighed
most heavily on the girls heart

Without turning on her light she went to the window and looked
out into the soft spring darkness Daddys letters Mothers
miniature The treasured old diary that Janice so loved

Her troubled little heart overflowed She flung herself down
with her face hidden in her arms folded upon the window sill
while ungovernable sobs shook her body

The loss of the treasurebox was a disaster for which she could
not easily forgive herself



CHAPTER VI THE CARRINGFORDS

Janice Day was a friendly little soul but she was not a girl who
made those close friendships that so many girls make during their
schooldays There was no one girl from whom she was almost
inseparable

Janice was just as good friends with Amy Carringford as she was
with Stella Latham only Amy had been attending the grammar
school a much shorter time than had the farmers daughter

Now circumstances attending Stellas proposed birthday party
caused Janice to become much better acquainted with Amy
Carringford In seeking to do something for Stella Janice was
determined to do something for Amy

The Carringford family had taken up their residence during the
winter in Mullen Lane and it must be confessed that Mullen Lane
was not considered an aristocratic part of the town Of course
poor people have to live where living is cheap but it was said
that Mrs Carringford who was a widow had bought the little
cottagenot much better than a hutin which she and her little
family had taken up their dwelling

Why people like the Carringford manifestly well bred and
intelligent had chosen Mullen Lane to live in puzzled not only
the busybodies like Miss Peckham of this part of Greensboro
but amazed other people as well

Wherever Mrs Carringford appearedat church Or in the
neighborhood stores on Knight and Cassandra Streetspeople saw
that she was a well bred woman though plainly even shabbily
dressed

There were several children besides Amy and the
Unfortunatelynamed Gumswith and they dressed poorly too But
even if Gummys trousers were patched at the knees as Stella
Latham had pointed out they were patched neatly and his linen
was fresh

Of course nobody called on Mrs Carringford at least almost
nobody The rickety little cottage in Mullen Lane did not
attract callers by its outward appearance that was sure That
it was a shelter for a family that had been sorely tried by fate
none of the neighbors knew

It was Janice Day when she made a frank attempt to know Amy
Carringford better who began first to learn particulars about
the Carringford family There was not much queer or mysterious
about them merely they were people who failed to advertise their
private affairs to the community at large

Janice had gained Stella Lathams promise that she would not tell
the secret of the party dress if Amy should consent to borrow
it before she sounded Amy as to whether she was going to accept
the invitation to

the party or not According to Stella who was really very silly
about such things the birthday party was to be a very dressy
affair Stella talked about this phase of it in season and out

First of all Janice demanded that one of the highly ornate
invitations Stellas mother had had printed in the Greensboro
Bugle printing office should be sent to Amy There should be no
hedging Janice determined after that Amy was to be asked like
the other girls and boys of their grade

But if she hasnt got a decent dress murmured Stella when she
was mailing the invitation to Amy

I told you Id see that she did have a party dress Janice said
sharply I cant agree to find whole trousers for Gummy and
she giggled so you neednt invite him if you dont want to
But Amy will be all right

Maybe she will be too proud to wear your dress Janice Day
exclaimed Stella

Then she wont come rejoined Janice But you are not to tell
a soul that the dress is mine if she does wear it

Weell sighed Stella somewhat relieved

The farmers daughter knew that there would be much comment if
she left Amy off the invitation list She was glad to leave the
matter in Janice Days hands And she did not remark again at
least not openly upon Janice being so sly

Without being at all sly Janice did go about doing something for
Amy Carringford with considerable shrewdness She had never
walked home with Amy from school She did not like the purlieus
of Mullen Lane But this afternoon she attached herself to Amy
with all the power of adherence of a mollusk and they were
chattering too fast to stop abruptly when they came to the comer
of Knight Street where usually Janice turned off

Mullen Lane touched Love Street at its upper end so Janice could
go all the way to the Carringford house without going much out of
her way She went on with Amy swinging her books and at first
Amy did not seem to notice that Janice was keeping with her right
into the muddy littered lane on which she lived

Why Janice said Amy finally you are away out of your way

Oh I can go up the lane to Love Street returned Janice
carelessly and just as though she were used to doing that

Amy who was a pretty blonde girl gazed at her companion rather
curiously but Janice was quite calm

That is the house where I live said Amy in a changed tone as
they came in sight of the cottage

Oh yes replied Janice

Aside from the fact that the house needed paint and new window
shutters and a new roof and new planks for the piazza and
numerous other things it was not such a bad looking house
Janice noticed something at first glance it was only things that
poor people could not get or that a boy could not tinker that was
needed about the Carringford house to make it neat and
comfortable

The fences were on the line had been braced and there were no
pickets missing The gates hung true The walks were neatly
kept and there were brilliant flower beds in front for flower
seeds cost little What the Carringford could do to make the
place homelike without spending money had certainly been done

Its an awful place to live ventured Amy still gazing
sidewise at Janice

Oh said the latter brightly you dont mean that You are all
together and are all well

Yes there are a lot of us And Amy said it with a sigh It
seems as though there were an awful lot of children now that
fathers dead

Did you lose your father recentlyjust as I did my mother
asked Janice softly

Year and a half ago That is why we came here There was some
insurance money Somebody persuaded mother to buy a home for us
with it I dont know whether it was good advice or not but she
bought this place because it was cheap And she could not pay
for it all at that so I dont know but were likely to lose the
money she put into it and the old shack too

Amy spoke rather bitterly Janice with natural tact thought
this was no time to probe deeper into the financial affairs of
the Carringfords She saw Gummy who was a year older than Amy
in the yard He had got home from school first and he stared
when he saw Janice

Hullo Gummy the latter called to the boy with the patched
trousers What are you doing there Are you laying sod for a
border to that gardenbed

No Im trimming an opera cloak with green ermine said the
boy but grinning What are you doing around here in Dirtyface
Lane

Oh Gummy exclaimed Amy

What a name to call the street objected Janice

Well thats what it is returned the boy continuing to pound
the sod into place Nobody in this street ever washes his
face

Why Gummy Carringford exclaimed his sister again

Im sure Amy washes her face whether you do or not chuckled
Janice

Oh me sniffed the boy but his eyes still twinkling Im
always gummy

Janices laughter was a silver peal that brought three or four
younger Carringfords including the twins to the side door
They peered out at their sister and the girl with her but were
bashful

What a jolly lot of little ones sighed Janice You know Amy
Im all alone I havent any brothers or sisters

Dont you want to adopt me asked Gummy who overheard her

I certainly would have to change your name declared Janice

No and he shook his head his freckled face becoming grave
Got to stick to the old namejust like gum sticks

Oh my dear is that you cried Mrs Carringford coming to the
door her brown face flushing pink And one of your
schoolmates

She came out on the porch She had a very pleasant smile Janice
thought and her brown eyes were as bright as a woodpeckers

This is Janice Day Shes in my class Mother said Amy
rather hesitatingly it must be confessed

Yes I know her name said Mrs Carringford and now Janice was
near enough to take the hand of Amys mother How do you do my
dear I have seen you before I am always glad to meet Amys
school friends

Had it not been for the warmth of the good womans greeting
Janice would have felt that she was unwelcome at the little
cottage on Mullen Lane Amy seemed to hang back and not invite
her schoolmate into the house

Here is something the postman brought you Amy her mother went
on briskly

She reached inside the door to a shelf and brought forth an
object that Janice recognized It was the big white envelope
containing the invitation to Stella Lathams party

Hi I know what that is cried Gummy rising to look at the
envelope Lots of the fellows got em That Latham girl that
lives out on the Dover pike is going to have a party Crickey
I didnt suppose she would invite us

She hasnt invited you I guess his mother told him It is
addressed to your sister

Oh I see

Amy had flushed brightly and her eyes sparkled She was tearing
open the envelope eagerly

Oh she sighed I didnt expect this Did you get yours
Janice

Yes Stella asked me But she didnt send out all the
invitations at once said Janice slowly

Youll go of course wont you

Why

Then suddenly Amys voice stopped She looked at her mother
The glow went out of her face She let one of the smaller
children take the invitation out of her hand

I dont know she said slowly Ill have to see

Wont you come in Janice asked Mrs Carringford seeking to
cover her daughters embarrassment

I will for a minute thank you was Janice Days smiling reply
You know I like Amy Mrs Carringford and I have never been to
her house before and she has never been to mine

Her speech helped to cover her friends hesitation Amy tripped
in behind Janice and suddenly gave her a hearty squeeze

Shes an awfully nice girl Mumsy she said to her mother

Janice laughed But her bright eyes were taking in much besides
the smiling expression on her friends faces The Carringford
kitchen was like wax Mrs Carringford had been washing in one
comer of the room and there was a boiler drying behind the
stove But there was nothing sloppy or sudsy about the room
The woman had whisked off the big apron she had worn when Janice
entered and now the latter saw that her work dress was spotless

Oh dear me thought Janice how nice it would be if our
kitchenand our whole housewere like this How delighted Daddy
would be

But there was something else she did not at first see She had to
get acquainted with all the younger Carringfords She must talk
with Mrs Carringford Gummy came in after washing his hands and
rubbing his shoes clean on the doormat to talk to the caller
Then Amy carried Janice off upstairs to her own tiny room under
the eaves

There was no carpet on the stairs The matting on the floor of
Amys room was much worn There was nothing really pretty in the
room Janice suddenly realized that this spelled poverty

Yet it was cheerful and speckless and there were pictures of a
kind and little homemade ornaments and a few books

The window curtains were of the cheapest but they were looped
back gracefully There was a workbox and stand that Gummy had
made for Amy for the brother was handy with tools

Altogether there was something about the room and about the ugly
little house as well that Janice Day realized she did not have
at home She had had it once but it was not present now in the
Day house In the Carringford dwelling the magic wand of a true
homemaker had touched it all

The two girls chatted for almost an hour It was mostly about
school matters and their friends and the teachers Amy talked
too about friends in Napsburg where the Carringfords had lived
before moving to Greensboro Janice was adroit in keeping the
conversation on rather general topics and did not allow the
question of Stellas party to come to the fore and never once did
she speak of what any of the girls would wear on that occasion

The time to leave came and then Janice felt she should enter the
wedge which would afterwards gain for her the desired end

Youll go to Stellas party wont you asked Janice as she
prepared to go home

Oh I dont know Ill see Amy hurriedly said

Of course you will go Janice declared firmly I want you to
go with me I shant feel like going at all if you stay away
Amy

They kissed each other on the stairway and then Janice ran home
swinging her books She thought the Carringford were very
pleasant people But there were several mysteries about them
First of all she wanted to know how Gummy came to have such an
awful awful name



CHAPTER VII ARLO JUNIOR AGAIN

Just as Janice was running in at the Love Street gate she was
halted by Arlo Junior Junior kept well out of the way at first
but his tone was confident well as ameliorating

Aw I say Janice he begged you aint mad at me are you

Why shouldnt I be she demanded her face flushing and the
hazel eyes sparking in an indignant way

Well I mean Well I hope you aint stammered Arlo Junior
unable entirely to smother a grin and yet plainly anxious to
pacify Janice You see Janice my mother was coming up from
downtown and she Saw you whacking me the other day

Oh

Yes she saw you said Junior nodding So I had to tell her
something of what made you do it

Indeed demanded Janice scornfully And what did you tell
her

I told her about the cats Anyway I told her left your back
kitchen door open and that the cats got in there and fought Oh
Jemima how they did fight didnt they I heard em after I
got back into the house that morning and Junior began to
giggle

They didnt fight said Janice shortly What you heard was
Olga pitching coal at em And then she up and left us We had
to get another girl And this new girl wont clean up the mess
in the back kitchen Thats what you did Arlo Weeks and Ive got
to clean up that room because of you

Oh Jemima gasped Junior giggling no more now Is that how
Miss Peckhams Samcat got hurt

What do you know about that demanded Janice quickly

Miss Peckhams been all over the neighborhood talking about it
She found the cat with a broken leg Got a veterinary Put it
in a plaster cast Did you ever

Well murmured Janice

I tell you what dont lets say anything about it begged
Junior eagerly I tell you what Ill do Ill come over
Saturday and help you clean up all the mess the cats and the girl
made But dont say a word

Well said Janice again

Now you promise Janice wheedled Junior If my mother learns
all about the cat business there will be a big row And all I
didreallywas to open that back kitchen door and then shut it
again after the cats got inside

They would never have gone in if you hadnt thrown the catnip in
there declared Janice warmly You know that very well
Junior

Well you wont say anything about it will you Janice if I
come and clean up the kitchen

Well said Janice for a third time lets see you do it I
wont promise until the kitchen is cleaned

But Arlo Junior went off with a grin on his face He knew Janice
would not tell if he kept his share of the agreement

Janice was anxious to know how Delia the new girl was getting
on with the housework There was a strong smell of scorching
vegetables the moment Janice opened the back door The kitchen
was empty but the pots on the stove foretold the fact that
dinner was in preparation at least two hours before it was
necessary

And the vegetables Janice ran to save them There was a
roaring fire under them but it was the water that had boiled
over after all Delia knew nothing it was evident about
simmering vegetables Boiling them furiously was her way

Oh dear sighed the girl I wonder if anything else can
happen to the Days There must be something the matter with me
or someone would sometime do something right in this house
Daddys dinner will not be fit to eat

That book on dietary that I got out of the library and tried to
read said that good cooking was most important I dont know
for I guess I didnt understand much of the booknot even of
that part I readbut I do know that a wellcooked meal tastes
better than a driedout one Oh dear

Janice shoved the pots back on the stove and shut off the drafts
so that the fire would die down She

wondered where Delia could be She had not seen her outside the
house She ran up the back stairs and looked in the girls room
before she went to her own

Delia was not upstairs Janice could not see that much had been
done in the way of houseworkat least on the upper floor Then
suddenly she discovered where the new girl was

From the living room came the loud drumming of the player piano
The instrument had not been much in use since the death of
Janices mother Somehow it seemed to both Janice and daddy that
they did not care to hear the piano that mother played so
frequently for them in the evening

But the instrument was in use nowno mistaking it There are
different ways of playing a mechanical piano Delias way was to
get all the noise out of it that was possible

Janice ran downstairs in some vexation There was no particular
crime in the new girls using the instrument even without asking
permission Yet when there was so much to do about the house
and as she saw plainly there had been so little done Janice
was vexed enough to give Delia a good talking to

And then she hesitated with her hand on the knob of the
livingroom door If she got Delia angry the woman might leave
as abruptly as Olga Cedarstrom had left It was a thought
suggesting tragedy Janice waited to calm herself while the new
girl pumped away on the piano in a perfect anvil chorus

Janice opened the door By the number of rolls spread out on the
top of the piano it was plain that Delia had played more music
than she had done housework The Garibaldi March came to a noisy
conclusion

Oh my sighed Delia in her squeaky voice aint that
wonderful

I should say it was Janice said quickly Wonderful indeed

Oh shrieked Delia flopping around on the bench and glaring at
Janice one hand clutching at her bosom You scaret me

I think you ought to be scared Your vegetables were boiling
over Delia

Oh you came in so sudden gasped the big woman IIve got
a weak heart You oughtnt to scare me so I can see mebbe that
Swede girl had a hard time here There is more than cats is the
matter And that woman next door has been around to find out how
her cats leg come broke

If a fluffy little kitten chasing a ball of yarn had suddenly
turned around and attacked Janice tooth and nail the girl would
have been no more surprised

Why Delia I am sorry if I frightened you Janice said But
you know this is not your part of the house and having put on
the vegetables even if it is too early I should think you would
remain in the kitchen and watch the pots

The giantess arose and wiped an eye She sniveled into the
corner of her apron

Well I didnt expect to be bossed by a child she squeaked
when I came to work here I dont like it

She flounced out of the room leaving the piano open and the
rolls strewn about

Oh dear me Now I have done it groaned Janice Day What will
Daddy say if I have got Delia mad and she goes It is just
awful

It really did seem to be a tragic situation Janice shook her
head and looked around the room Everything was just as it had
been the night before when they went to bed save the opened
music cabinet and littered piano

There were daddys cigar ashes in the tray a cup with tea
grounds in it as he had left it by his elbow The smoking stand
was not tidied nor the table There was dust on everything and
a litter of torn papers on the rug

Why had Delia not cleaned up the room if she had so much time to
play the piano

I suppose if I ask her why she did not sweep and dust in here
she will tell me that she forgot whether I said to use the blue
dustcloth or the pink groaned Janice

One girl they had had actually gave that excuse as

logical when the work was neglected There was nothing laughable
in this situationnothing at all

Oh if I could only do something myself murmured the young
girl

After what had occurred she thought it best to say nothing more
to Delia at the time She hated to bother daddy again but she
wondered what he would do if he had to confront such
circumstances at the bank

Of course mens work is awfully important Janice sighed but
what would daddy do if confronted by these little annoying things
that seem to be connected with the housework

There were a dozen things Janice would have preferred to do right
now But she could not have daddy come home and see such a
looking livingroom She put on apron and cap and went to work
immediately to do what Delia should have done earlier in the day

In an hour or so the room was swept dusted and well aired She
had returned the music rolls to the cabinet and closed the piano
She wished there was a key to it so that Delia could not get at
it again for if the new girl was musically inclined Janice
foresaw little housework done while she was at school and daddy
was at work

Then Janice ventured into the kitchen Delia was not there The
vegetables were already cooked and were in the warmer where they
would gradually become dried out Janice had done the marketing
on her way to school that morning and had sent home a steak
The steak was already cooked and was on a platter likewise in
the warming oven And it was yet an hour to dinner time

Janice opened the door to the stairway There was no sound from
that part of the house She went to the back door then and
there was Delia talking earnestly with Miss Peckham over the
boundary fence

The fact smote Janice like a physical blow She remembered what
Arlo Junior had said about the cat Miss Peckham had found the
poor creature and had sent for the veterinary doctor to treat
him

What Janice had already admitted regarding the cat and what
Delia might tell Miss Peckham would breed trouble just as sure
as the world What should she do

She might have been unwise enough to have run out and interfered
in the backfence conference But just then she heard daddys
key in the front door and she ran to meet him

Oh Daddy Did you find out anything more about Olga and where
she went the young girl cried as soon as she saw Broxton Day

I guess I have found nothing of importance said her father
shaking his head gravely

Oh my dear Nothing

Nothing that explains where the treasurebox went to Janice
he said Nor much that explains any other part of the mystery

But the telephone number Who did she call up

Yes I found out about that he admitted hanging up his coat
and hat She called the public booths in the railroad station
There was somebody waiting there to answer her And who do you
suppose it was

I couldnt guess Daddy

Willie Sangreen He is the young man who is checker at the
pickle works and who I told you was Olgas steady company He
has gone away and nobody seems to know where

They have gone away together cried Janice in despair

She knew where he was going to be at that hour sure enough she
would probably have called him at the telephone in the railroad
station anyway And the catastrophe he smiled a little and
Olgas getting so angry may have changed their plans completely
Maybe he did meet her somewhere

Oh Daddy what kind of a looking man is Willie Sangreen cried
Janice

I really could not tell you

But maybe it was he who drove the taxicab suggested the girl

That might be worth looking up said her father And yet it
does not explain he added as they went into the livingroom
why Olga should have stolen the treasurebox That seems to be
the greatest mystery



CHAPTER VIII THEY COME AND GO

Daddy do you mind if we have dinner a little early this
evening Janice asked

I have my appetite with me if that is what you want to know
said Broxton Day smiling down upon her

Well Delia has it all ready I think Too early of course

Bring it on cried her father jovially I can do it justice

Janice wondered if he could Already the food she knew was
drying up in the warming oven She hurried out into the kitchen
Delia had not come in from the backyard Janice shrank from
interfering with that backfence conference but she could not
see daddys dinner spoiled

Come Delia she called opening the door My father has come
home

Oh my Is your paw arrived asked the giantess coming
lingeringly away from the fence

Janice saw Miss Peckhams snappy little eyes viewing her at the
kitchen door with no pleasant expression She felt that something
was brewingsomething that would not be pleasant But the
spinster retired without speaking to her

You have dinner ready very early Delia Janice said as the
big woman lumbered into the kitchen

Didnt you just say your paw had come demanded Delia in her
squeaky voice

Yes But you have everything ready at five oclock instead of
at six

Oh yes I dont never believe in keepin folks waitin for
their victuals said Delia tossing her head You aint got
any call to be criticalno you aint

It was of no use Janice saw that as plainly as she saw
anything This giantess has a dwarfs brain As daddy said
when he became particularly Yankeefied she didnt know
beans It would be quite useless to talk to her or to expect
her to remember what she was told to do

I will do all I can to hide the rough corners from Daddy
Janice thought Ill watch Delia before I go to school and
come home from school to straighten her out just as quickly as I
can I just wont run to him with every little household
trouble

But it was a wretched dinner It was so badly cooked that daddy
shook his head over it mournfully

It is a mystery to me how they manage to boil one potato to mush
while another is so hard you cant stick your fork into it he
said And no seasoning This steak nowor is it steak

Now Daddy said Janice half laughing yet feeling a good deal
like crying

Well I wasnt quite sure said her father I wonder if these
cooks think that meat grows all seasoned on the critter
They must believe that However does she do the other work
well

II dont know yet murmured Janice Ill help her all I
can Daddy and tell her how if shell let me

Well maybe we can make something of her said Broxton Day
with his hearty and cheerful laugh Remember Olga wanted to
boil fresh pork chops for our breakfast when she first came

I do wish we knew where Olga had gone to said Janice It
doesnt seem as though that girl would deliberately steal I
cant believe it And if we dont get back that treasurebox and
what it contains Daddy my heart willjustbebroken

There there Dont give way about it There is a chance yet of
finding Olgaand the box too said her father trying to
comfort his little daughter I will not give up the search
Willie Sangreen will of course come back to his job and he must
know what has become of Olga Those Swedes are very clannish
indeed over there at Pickletown but some of them bank with us
and I am sure they will be on the lookout for the

girl Only of course I have not told them why I am so anxious
to find her

They finished dinner and Delia came in to clear away with her
plump lips pouting and a general air about her of having been
much injured But Mr Day now so used to the vagaries of hired
help made no comment

He and Janice went into the livingroom This at least was
homelike and clean He settled into his chair and picked up the
paper Just then there was a ring at the front doorbell

Janice would have jumped up to answer it but she heard the
giantess going through the hall There was a voice Janice
recognized it with a start Then the giantess approached the
livingroom door heavy footed with a clatter of smaller
bootheels behind her

Delia threw open the door as Mr Day dropped his paper to look
up Her fat face was wreathed in a triumphant smile and she
said

Its the nice lady from nex door I guess she come to see your
paw about them cats

Mr Day looked puzzled

Janice could have screamed as Miss Peckham marched in Delia
apparently intended to stand in the doorway and enjoy whatever
there was to enjoy but as Mr Day rose from his seat to welcome
the neighbor he said firmly

Thank you Delia We shall not need you in here at present
You may go

The giantess tossed her head and lumbered out of the room
slamming the door behind her with unnecessary violence

Goodevening Miss Peckham said the man offering the spinster
a chair I dont know just what Delia meant about cats but I
presume you will explain

Huh snapped Miss Peckham I guess that girl of yours hasnt
told you about what she done to my Sam No indeed I guess not

She was evidently working herself up into a violent state of
mind and Mr Day who knew his next door

neighbor very well hastened to smooth the troubled waters

I had not heard anything about cats Miss Peckham save the
misfortune of a cat convention in our back kitchen yesterday
morning Janice told me about that of course but she could
scarcely be blamed for it

I dont know why she shouldnt be blamed ejaculated the angry
woman And my Sams got a broken leg

I am sorry if any of the cats were injured It was a
thoughtless joke of he caught Janices eye and understood her
meaning of one of the neighbors boys He meant no particular
harm I fancy

You neednt try an lay it on no boy exclaimed Miss Peckham
Twas a girl done it My Sam

You mean that a girl broke the cats leg queried Mr Day
quietly

I mean just that Twas a girl And that is the girl and she
pointed an accusing finger at the flushed Janice

Oh I never exclaimed the latter under her breath and shaking
her head vigorously

Mr Day gave her a smiling look of encouragement

I feel sure he said to Miss Peckham that if Janice had by
chance injured an animala cat or any othershe would have
told me But although it may have been a girl who broke your
cats leg it was not Janice

You dont know anything about it cried Miss Peckham angrily
You dont know what goes on here all day long while you are
gone I pity you Mr DayI pity you from the bottom of my
heart You ought to have a woman here to manage this girl of
yours Thats what you need

Oh gasped Janice her color receding now She was very angry

Ah dont you flout me Janice Day exclaimed the spinster
eyeing Janice malevolently I know how bad you act I dont
live right next door for nothin An tisnt only at home you
act badly but on the street Fighting with boys like a hoodlum
Oh I heard about it

Wait Wait exclaimed Mr Day with sternness I think you
are out of bounds Miss Peckham I do not ask you to tell me how
to take care of my little daughter And I am sure I do not
believe that you are rightly informed about her actions even if
you do live next door

Miss Peckham sniffed harder and tossed her head Let us get
back to the cats he went on quietly Have you found that one
of your cats has been hurt

His legs broke The doctor said it was a most vicious blow
Hes put it in a cast and poor Sam is quite wild

But why do you blame Janice

She done it exclaimed the spinster nodding her shawled head
vigorously She ought to be looked after

No Janice did not hurt the cat said Mr Day with assurance
unfortunately the cat was hurt on our premises But it was the
girl working for us not my little girl who injured your cat

What do you mean demanded Miss Peckham sharply Not this big
thing youve got herethe one that let me in

The Swedish girl explained Mr Day The cats were shut into
our back kitchen and before Janice could open the door to let
them out Olga I believe pelted them with coal

But what did she shut em up in the kitchen for demanded Miss
Peckham still pointing and glaring at Janice

Oh I didnt exclaimed the latter shaking her head
vigorously

That was not my daughters doings Mr Day repeated As I tell
you your cat was undoubtedly hurt on our premises If I can do
anything to satisfy youpay the doctors bill or the like

I dont want money from you Broxton Day exclaimed

the woman rising I didnt come here for that purpose I came
here to tell you that your house is goin to rack and ruin and
that your girl needs a strong hand to manage her Thats what
she needs You aint had no proper home here since your wife
died

I fear that is only too true Miss Peckham replied Mr Day

If Mrs Day knew how things was goin shed turn in her grave I
do believe went on the neighbor perhaps not wholly in
bitterness

The mans face paled Miss Peckham did not know how much she was
adding to the burden of sorrow in the hearts of Broxton Day and
his little daughter Janice was sobbing now with her face
hidden

What you need is an intelligent woman to take hold went on the
neighbor warming to her subject Take this creature you got
now Ugh Big elephant and dont scarcely know enough to come
in when it rains I do believe

The class of people one finds at the agencies is admittedly not
of a high order of intelligence said Mr Day softly

I should say they werentif them youve had is samples
sniffed Miss Peckham Why dont you get somebody decent

I wish you would tell me how to go about getting a better
houseworker sighed Mr Day

Get a working housekeeperone thats trained and is
respectable Somebody to overlook

But I cannot afford two servants the man hastened to submit

I aint suggesting another servant Somebody that respects
herself too much to be called a servant Of course its hard to
find the right party

However some women can do it And that is the kind you need
Broxton Day Somebody who will be firm with your girl here
too

I am afraid said Janices father quietly that the sort of
person you speak of is beyond my means perhaps such a marvel is
not in the market at all and he

smiled again Thank you for your interest Miss Peckham

He rose again to see her to the door The spinster might have
considered remaining longer and offering further advice but
daddy knew how to get rid of people quickly and cheerfully when
their business was over

Oh Daddy what a dreadful woman she is sobbed Janice when he
came back into the livingroom

Not so bad as that he said chuckling and patting her
shoulder comfortingly It is her way to make much of a little
You see she did not want anything for her injured cat she
merely wanted to come in and talk about it

Butbut Daddy confessed Janice blushing deeply I really
did fight Arlo Junior on the street I boxed his ears

Mr Day had great difficulty to keep from laughing but Janice
was too absorbed in her troubles to notice it

Well well Taking the law into your own hands were you

Yes Daddy I guess it wasnt very ladylike But Im not a
hoodlum

Why was it that you did not want me to mention Arlo Junior
asked Mr Day curiously

Well you see I sort of promised him I wouldnt tell about what
he did to the cats if he came in here Saturday and helped me
clean that back kitchen

Ho ho I see Well perhaps you are quite right to shield the
young scamp under those circumstances said her father with
twinkling eyes

Mr Day talked to his daughter for a while longer He asked her
about her school work and her school pleasures about what the
girls and boys in her circle of friends were doing He tried to
keep in close touch with the motherless girls interests and
especially did he not want her to go to bed with sad and
troublous thoughts in her mind

After a cheerful and happy half hour Janice kissed her

father goodnight and went to her own room

Janice did all she could the next morning before going to school
to start Delia right in the housework But the giantess was
still sullen and had much to say about it comin to a pretty
pass when children boss their elders

This was an objection that Janice had contended with before She
only said pleasantly

When you have once learned just how we do things here I shant
have to tell you again Delia But wherever you go to work you
know you will have to learn the ways of the house

I was doin housework I was when you was in your cradle
declared the woman

But evidently not doing it just as we like to have it done
here insisted Janice cheerfully Now try to please daddy
Delia Everything will be all right then

Delia only sniffed She sniffed in a higher key than Janice
had ever heard anybody sniff before Certainly Mrs Bridget
Burns was not turning out to be as mild creature as Janice had
first believed her to be She could be stubborn

When she got to school that morning Janice found that there was
another disturbing incident in the offing Amy Carringford
squeezed her arm as they hurried in to grammar recitation and
smiled at her But it was with gravity that she whispered in
Janices ear

I guess I shall have to refuse Stellas invitation

Oh you must go

No I cant go

Dont dare say that Amy responded Janice earnestly You
havent told her you arent coming have you

Noo

Dont you dare repeated Janice

Butbut I dont see how I can

Wait Ill tell you after school Dont say a word to Stella
about not going to the party I tell you if you dont go I
shant

Oh Janice

There was no time for more whispering Amys big luminous eyes
were fixed on her friend a good deal through the several
recitations they both attended It was evident she was puzzled

At lunch hour Amy always ran home for Mullen Lane at least
the end on which she livedwas not far And perhaps she did
not care to join the girls who brought nice lunches in pretty
baskets So Janice could not talk with her new friend until
school was out

Janice had determined to make a friend of Amy Carringford Oh
yes when Janice Day made up her mind to a thing she usually did
it And she had conceived a great liking for Amy as well as a
deep interest in the whole Carringford family

Now Janice what did you mean Amy asked as they set off from
the schoolhouse with their books I just cant go to that
party

Daddy says that it is a mistake to say that the word cant is
not in the dictionary for it isin the newer ones But I am
sure it ought not to be found in the bright lexicon of
youthlike fail you know and Janice laughed

You are just talking giggled Amy clinging to Janices arm
I dont know what you mean

You are going to know soon my dear returned Janice Come
home with me Your mother wont mind will she

No Ill send word by Gummy

My that sounds almost like swearingby Gummy exclaimed
Janice her hazel eyes dancing And there Gummy goes Grab him
quick Tell him youll stay to supper

Oh no Ill tell him Ill stay till supper rejoined Amy as
she ran after her brother

She caught up with Janice within half a block laughing and
skipping Never had Janice seen Amy so lighthearted Even the
thought that she could not go to the party at Stella Lathams
house did not serve to make Amy sorrowful for long And Janice
guessed why

Amy Carringford had been hungry for a close friend Perhaps
Janice was starved too for such companionship At any rate
Amy responded to Janices friendliness just as a sunflower
responds to the orb of the day and turns toward it

The two girls went on quite merrily toward the Day cottage at
Eight Hundred and Fortyfive Knight Street There was plenty to
chatter about without even touching on the coming party Janice
had plans about that

When the two came in sight of the Day house those plans and
almost everything elsewent out of Janices head There was a
high dusty empty rubbish cart standing before the side gate of
the Day premises and from the porch a man in the usual khaki
uniform of the Highway Department was bringing out a black
oilcloth bag which Janice very well remembered

Oh dear me what can have happened Janice cried starting to
run That is Delias bagthe very one she brought with her

She arrived at the gate just as the man came through the opening
He was a dustyfaced man with a bristling mustache and great
overhanging brows He looked very angry too

Oh what is the matter asked Janice as the man pitched the
oilcloth bag into the cart and turned back toward the house
again

But he was not regarding at all the girl or her chum who then ran
up He turned to bellow in through the open door

Hi Come out o that Biddy Burns Ye poor innocent Sure with
your two little children home cryin all day alone and me at
work ye should be ashamed of yerself me gurrl If I was the
kind of a feyther ye nade Id be wearin a hairbrush out on ye
big and old as ye be Come out o thator will I come in afther
ye

Mercy me gasped Amy

Oh Oh exclaimed Janice tugging at the mans

sleeve what are you doing to Delia

Delia is it More of her foolishness Shes Biddy Burns
and her husband is deadlucky man that he is And Im her
feyther and the grandfeyther of her two babiesTessie and
Melia And if she dont come home this minute with me Ill put
the young ones in a home so I will

Delia in the flounced dress and weeping just then appeared
She stumbled down the steps and came to the gate blubbering like
a child

Sure he says Ive got to go hoome sobbed the giantess
Tis me fatherhe tells the truth But I wanted to earn money
myself He never lets me do nothing I want to do

Ye big foolish gurrl ejaculated the man gruffly Was it
workin for you she was Miss

Yes said Janice breathlessly

And they had a pianny sobbed Delia Twas beautiful

You come home an play on the washboardthats the kind of a
pianny you nade to play on grumbled her father Im sorry for
ye he added turning to Janice if your folks has to depend on
the likes of her to do the work Sure its not right good sinse
shes got

He came behind the giantess suddenly and boosted her with strong
arms up to the seat at the front of the wagon Then he climbed
up himself and the turnout rattled away heavily along the street

Delias departure was one of the most astounding things that had
happened to the Days during the months of their dependence upon
itinerant houseworkers



CHAPTER IX  SHOCKS AND FROCKS

Janice found herself clinging tightly to Amy Carringfords hand
and Amy clinging tightly to hers as the rubbish wagon rattled
away with Delia and her grim father perched on the high seat
while the black oilcloth bag rattled around in the otherwise
empty body of the cart

Oh Janice gasped Amy at last

Oh Amy rejoined her friend And no dinner for daddy when he
comes home

Amy could not comment on this catastrophe for the moment for
Miss Peckham the only neighbor who seemed to have marked the
departure of Delia came swiftly into view Miss Peckhams
blinds were always bowed and one never knew which blind she was
lurking behind

Well she exclaimed and Janice thought she said it quite
cheerily so that ones gone has she

Theythey just seem to come and go Janice replied almost in
tears Oh dear Delia wasnt much but I did hope she would
stay a little longer

Much sniffed Miss Peckham I should say she wasnt And
she isnt even sensible I should think even a girl of your age
could have seen she was moren half crazy Wouldnt expect your
father to notice nothing Hes only a man

Oh Really crazy do you mean Amy Carringford burst out

She never was moren half bright that Biddy Garrity That was
her name before she married Tom Burns And he died Blowed up
in the powder mill That was old Garrity who came for her She
aint got no right to run off and leave her two children and that
old man to get along as best they can But she does itoften I
thought there would be trouble just as soon as I seen her sitting
on your steps tother day

Well I wish wed known it sighed Janice She she did seem
sort of funny But she wasnt much worse than some of the others
weve had

Humph sniffed Miss Peckham just what I told your father last
night You need a manager heresomebody to take hold

I shall have to take hold now and see about getting dinner for
daddy Janice responded recovering a measure of her
selfconfidence Come on in Amy and watch me work

If I come in and help you said her friend I guess you wont
have to do it all

A glance through the lower rooms proved that Delia had done
little more toward straightening the house this day than the day
before

Goodness mercy me Janice Day exclaimed Amy Carringford
Im awfully glad we dont have to have servants It must be
awful

It just is sighed Janice You never know when you come home
from school whether you will find the girl or not And youre
most always sure to find that not half the works been done
Well I can get daddy some sort of a dinner myself tonight

What are you going to cook Let me help said Amy eagerly I
know how to make lovely rollsonly you have to set the sponge
the night before And Judge Peterss pudding is just luscious
Only you have to have currants and citron and chopped nuts to go
into it

We wont have either of those things for dinner then said
Janice with a cheerful laugh

Well we dont have them nowadays sighed Amy But we used
to

I suppose you have had to give up lots of nice things since your
father died rejoined her friend sympathetically But and
she giggled Gummy said yesterday he couldnt give up his name

The poor boy Amy declared shaking her head Give me an
apron Janice I am going to peel those potatoes and that
turnip Potatoes and turnip mashed together makes a nice dish
And Gummy cant really give up his name

Gumswith Its awful murmured Janice How ever

Well Ill tell you Poor dear father had a halfbrother who was
lots older than he Grandmother Carringford had been married
before she married our grandfather you see And her first
husbands name was Mr Gumswith John Gumswith Its not so bad
as a last name you see

No agreed Janice her eyes twinkling Not when you say it
quick

Amy laughed again busy peeling the vegetables And she peeled
them thin Janice noticed Amy had evidently been taught the
fine points of frugal housekeeping

So poor Gummy got his name from John Gumswith Junior I guess
fathers halfbrother was a queer man He said hed never marry
because he was always wandering about the world

Like a peddler ventured Janice

No But he went to foreign countries He always expected to
earn a lot of money by some stroke of fortune mother says But
none of us children ever saw him Before Gummy was born Uncle
John Gumswith started off for Australia and mother and father
never heard of him or from him after that

But they named poor Gummy after him commented Janice busy
with the onion she was chopping to season the hamburger roast
and trying to keep the juice of the onion out of her eyes

You see Amy confessed confidentially when father and mother
were married Uncle John gave them a little nest egg You
understand He had some money and he gave some of it to them
And then he was fathers only living relative so they named the
first baby Gumswithso that the family name should not die out
you know

My goodness exclaimed Janice but whether because of the
saddling of Gummy Carringford with such a name or because of the
squirting of onion juice into her left eye she did not explain
at the moment

So Gummy is Gummy sighed his sister Father didnt name him
that just for the moneys sake Mother says a million dollars
wouldnt really pay for such a name But father thought a lot of
Uncle John Gumswith

But when Gummy grows up he will have to go through life so he
says signing has name G Carringford and Amy began to giggle
at this thought

It is really too bad said Janice but her mind was on another
subject just then How quick you are Amy You know how to do
everything dont you

No I dont But what I know I know well said her friend in
her quiet way Is your water hot This turnip wants to go
right on for it take longer to cook than the potatoes

Here you are said Janice seizing the pot and carrying it to
the stove There she poured boiling water over the turnip and
set the pot where it would continue to simmer Its too early
to put the roast in yet Come on upstairs Amy I know that
Delia neither made up my bed nor dusted my room I did daddys
before I went to school this morning

Such a nice house murmured Amy as she followed Janice
upstairs by the way of the front hall

And not half kept sighed Janice When dear mother was with
us

She and Amy said no more until Janices bedroom was all spick and
span again Janice hugged her friend heartily when at last the
pillows were plumped up at the head of the bed

Youre a dear she said You do like me dont you Amy

Of course I do

Then youll go to Stellas party with me you

Oh but Janice I cant

Theres that word cant again said Janice lightly I dont
believe in itno maam You can go if you want to

II havent a thing nice enough to wear confessed Amy
desperately her face flaming and water standing in her eyes
As though that was a good reason Let me show you what I am
going to wear

But the pretty black and white dress that Janice brought forth
from her closet only made Amy shake her head

Yes I know But it is newand very nice

Ive never worn it yet confessed Janice

And everything Ive got is as old as the hills groaned Amy
Carringford

Well look hereand hereand here Janice tossed as many
frocks upon the bed What do you suppose is going to become of
those

Oh Janice how pretty they are This pink and white one

Mmm my mother made them for me said Janice trying to speak
bravely And now they are too small anyway Ive grown a lot
since a year ago

Oh Janice

So you are going to wear one of them to Stellas party
declared Janice confidently The pink and white one if you
like

Oh Janice I cant My mother wouldnt let me

Im going to make her let you Im going to beg her on my
knees declared Janice laughing Do get into it Amy and see
if it fits you

Welll

It did There was no doubt but that Amy was just a wee bit
smaller than Janice and that the frocks were an almost perfect
fit

Butbut to take a whole new dress from youa gift Oh
Janice I know it isnt right Mother will not hear of it

Mothers going to hear of itand from me declared Janice
Tomorrows Saturday After I get all the work done and Arlo
Junior helps me clean that back kitchen I am going to bring this
dress down to your house I know when she once sees it on you
she wont have the heart to say No

So perhaps Janice Day was sly after all



CHAPTER X OTHER PEOPLES TROUBLE

Daddy of course laughed If it had not been for his sanguine
temperament and his ability to see the funny side of life
Janice often wondered what they should do

They say she thought that every cloud has a silver lining
But to dear daddy there is something better than silver linings
to our clouds Something to laugh at I wonder if after all
being able to see the fun in things isnt the biggest blessing in
the world I am sure Miss Peckham isnt happy and she never
sees anything funny at all But daddy

When she told him at dinner time how Delia had departed on the
rubbish wagon with her angry father Broxton Day laughed so that
he could scarcely eat

But what are we going to do cried Janice

Dont be a little Martha honey troubled with many things I
would have given a good deal to have seen that departure Good
riddance to bad rubbish is an old saying back in Vermont where
I was brought up Janice And Delia going in the rubbish wagon
seems fitting doesnt it

It was funny admitted his little daughter But what shall we
do

Why try the next applicant said Broxton Day easily I will
look in at the agencies again

Im afraid that wont do any good Daddy sighed Janice
Delia came from the agency and you see what she was like And
Olga

No interrupted Mr Day Olga came direct from Pickletown

Well it doesnt matter There were plenty of others from the
agencies all as bad or worse than Olga and Delia and Janice
looked much downcast

Oh little daughter little daughter admonished Mr Day
dont give way like that Some time out of the lot well find
the right person

Well maybe agreed Janice cheerful once more I guess weve
already had all the bad ones Those that are left to come to us
must be just ordinary human beings with some good and some sense
mixed in with the bad

It proved to be a very busy day indeed for Janice that
Saturday But she did not overlook her promise to Amy
Carringford Yet it was midafternoon when she started for
Mullen Lane with the pink and white party dress in a neat package
over her arm

Janice could not overlook the povertystricken appearance of the
Carringford cottage It could not indeed be ignored by even
the casual glance But its cleanliness and everybodys neatness
about the little dwelling portrayed the fact that here was a
family putting its best foot forward Mrs Carringford was
proud Janice Day knew that she must be very cautious indeed if
she would see Amy adorned with her own finery

Dear Mrs Carringford she whispered to her friends mother
Ive got a surprise for you I want Amy to come upstairs with
me and by and by when we call you up please come and look into
her room

Amy according to agreement had said nothing about the dress to
her mother She was eager but doubtful just the same

I dont think it is right Janice she declared over and over
I dont see how I can accept the dress from you when I have
nothing to give in return

Oh that is a very niggardly way to receive cried Janice
shaking her head If we cant accept a present save when we can
return itwhy daddy says that is the most selfish thought in
the world

Selfish

For sure We are too selfish to allow other people to enjoy
giving Dont you see Its fun to give

But it is not fun to be the object charity complained Amy
with some sullenness

Why my dear exclaimed Janice Day you are not always going
to be poor Of course not Some day you will be lots better
off Gummy will grow up and go to work and then you will all be
well off And besides this sort of giving between friends
isnt charity

Gummy wishes to go to work now sighed Amy But mother wants
to keep him at school

He might work after school and on Saturdays

Oh that would be fine But who would give him such a job You
see we do not trade much with the storekeepers and mother isnt
very well known

You wait exclaimed Janice I believe I know somebody who
needs a boy

Oh I hope you do Janice

Meanwhile Amy was getting into that lovely dainty dress again

You do look too sweet for anything in it Janice declared The
latter ran out to the stairs and called to Mrs Carringford
Oh do come up and look Do Mrs Carringford

She kept Amys bedroom door shut and held Mrs Carringford for a
moment at the top of the stairs

Oh Mrs Carringford she murmured dont you want to make two
girls just awfully happy

Why my dear child

You know I have been growing just like a weed this past year
Daddy says so I have outgrown all the pretty clothes mymy
mother made me for last summer and which of course I could not
wear Amy is just a wee bit smaller than I 

My dear

Wait gasped Janice almost in tears she was so much in
earnest Just wait and see her And I want her to go to the
party And there are stockings and pumps and a hat and
everything Look at her

She flung open the bedroom door Amy stood across the room from
them flushing and paling by turns and looking really
frightened but oh so pretty

Why Amy murmured Mrs Carringford her own cheeks flushing

What mother can look at her little daughter when she is
charmingly dressed without being proud of her She turned
questioningly to Janice

Does your father know about this

Daddy quite approves said Janice demurely I never could get
any wear out of them You can see that Mrs Carringford

And if you let Amy wear them well both be so happy

Mrs Carringford kissed her You are a sweet good child she
said rather brokenly I dont blame Amy for loving you

So it was agreed that Amy should wear the party dress Janice had
errands to do at the store and she begged for the company of
Gummy Carringford to help her carry the things she bought

You know I cant carry them all and sometimes Harrimans
delivery doesnt get around until midnight and we have to get up
and take the things in

Come on said Gummy who knew about the dress for his sister
Ill carry anything you want

But Janice really had another reason for getting Gummy
Carringford to Harrimans store She maneuvered to get Mr
Harriman himself to wait on her and when Gummy was out of
earshot she began to confide in the proprietor

Do you see that boy who is with me Mr Harriman she asked

Oh yes Ive seen him before I guess One of your neighbors

He goes to our school And he is a very nice boy

Whats his name

His name is G Carringford Janice told demurely

Oh G queried Mr Harriman Is that all

Well you know it isnt his fault if he has dreadful name she
said And it doesnt really hurt him He can work just as
hardand he wants work

I thought you said he went to school

After school and on Saturdays she explained He doesnt know
you Mr Harriman so I suppose he is bashful about speaking to
you But you know him now because I introduced G Carringford
Wont you try him

The outcome of this attempt to help the Carringfords was one of
the many things Janice had to confide to daddy that evening As
she told him she had put little dependence upon the hope of
finding another houseworker easily And that was well for Mr
Day had found nobody at the agencies He would not trust
engaging a girl again unseen

Perhaps next week will bring us good fortune my dear he said
How did you get on today all alone I see the silver has been
polished

Only some of it Daddy And I have been a busy bee now I tell
you

Bravo my dear The busy bee makes the honey

And has a stinger too she replied roguishly I guess Arlo
Junior thinks so

So Junior came over according to promise said her father
interested

Yes indeed And he did work Daddy You should have seen
him

The vision of Arlo Weeks Junior working really would be worth
the price of admission chuckled Broxton Day

That isnt the worst of itfor Arlo said Janice gaily You
see his helping me clean up that back kitchen got him a bad
reputation

Why Janice How was that

Oh he did the cleaning very well As well as it could be done
That soft coal made marks on the walls that never will come off
until they are painted again Its awful smutchythat coal

I know agreed Broxton Day But about Arlo

Im coming to that she said smiling You see Arlo Junior
was just about through when his mother come over looking for him
She wanted him to go on an errand She saw what he had been doing
for me for he had an apron on and the broom in his hand

Caught with the goods in other words chuckled Mr Day

Yes And we couldnt tell her why he was helping me So she
said right out

Why Arlo Junior If you can help Janice like this and you
and she were fighting the other dayyou can come right home and
clean out the woodshed It needs it

Andand laughed Janice he had to do it He worked pretty
near all day today And he scowled at me dreadfully this
afternoon

He will be playing other tricks on you warned her father

Well there will be no Olga to make them worse she sighed
That is one sure thing Oh dear Daddy I wonder where she
isand the treasurebox It is too too hateful for anything

I called up the pickle factory where Willie Sangreen works
They had heard nothing from him It looks as though Olga and he
must have gone away together Stole a march on all their friends
and got married maybe

But why should she take my treasurebox cried Janice Oh
Daddy I can never forgive myself for my carelessness

Dont worry child You could not really be blamed he
rejoined sadly

But that doesnt bring back mothers picture and the other
things murmured the anxious Janice watching his clouding face

As always when they were alone daddy washed the supper dishes
and Janice dried them Daddy with an apron on and his sleeves
rolled up and a paper cap on his head she made him wear that
like a regular chef made a picture that always pleased his
daughter

I think you would make a very nice cook Daddy dear she often
told him In fact you seem to fit in almost anywhere I guess
its because you are always ready to do something

Flattery Flattery he returned pinching her cheek

But it is so you know Daddy You always know what to doand
you do it

That is what they tell me at the bank said Mr Day with
rather a rueful smile This Mexican mine business is developing
some troubles and they want me to go down there and straighten
them out

Oh Daddy she cried breathlessly

No he said shaking his head That is what I tell them I
cannot leave you alone

But take me she cried almost dancing up and down

Cant be thought of Janice That is a rough country
and youve got to stick to school besides You know my dear
we had already decided on that

Yes I know she sighed But of course you wont go away and
leave me Weweve never been separated sincesince dear mamma
died

True my dear And we will not contemplate such separation I
have told them at the bank it would be impossible It was not
of their own troubles that they talked mostly on this evening
however but of some other peoples troubles After they were
out of the kitchen and settled in the livingroom Janice began
to tell him about the Carringfords They are just the nicest
people you ever saw Daddy Amy and Gummy are coming over here
tomorrow after Sunday School so that you can meet them

Gummy ejaculated Mr Day

Janice told him all about that boys unfortunate name

You see she explained Mrs Carringford told me herself this
afternoon that his Uncle John Gumswith was a very nice man

Seems to me said daddy quite amused that doesnt make the
boys name any less unfortunate And have they never even heard
of the uncle since he went to Australia

No sir

Well chuckled Mr Day Gummy had better go to the Legislature
and get his name changed Thats a handicap that no boy should
have to shoulder

It is awful And it makes Gummy shy I think He wanted to
work after school hours and on Saturday But he didnt seem to
know how to get a job So I Janice proceeded quite in a
matteroffact way got him one

You did

Yes Daddy I went to Mr Harriman the grocer You know we
trade there And I know that he can use a boy just as well as
not So I told him about Gummy

Did you tell Harriman his name chuckled her father

I said he was G Carringford Janice replied her eyes
twinkling But you neednt laugh Mr Harriman did

Did what

Laugh I really wanted Gummy to take a nom de plume or whatever
it is they call em

An alias I guess it would be in Gummys case said her
father And wouldnt he

No said Janice shaking her head Gummy seems to think that
hes in honor bound to stick up for his name That is what he
says

Amen Some boy that

Hes a nice boy declared Janice Youll see And he got the
job

Oh he did So I see that my Janice is a real do something
girl

Why yes I hadnt thought of that she agreed all smiles at
his praise I did do something didnt I Gummy is going to
work for Mr Harriman and thatll help them But it was about
Amy and Stella Lathams party I wanted to tell you

Oh was it indeed her father murmured

She related the circumstances attached to the coming party and
Amy Carringfords reason for not being able to go

And you ought to see Amy in that pink and white dress Shes
just too sweet for anything

All right daughter I agree to give your little friend the
frock if her mother is willing

I just made Mrs Carringford agree said Janice bobbing her
head earnestly They are awfully proud folks

With a proper pride perhaps

I guess so They are real nice anywayeven if Gummy does wear
patched pants

And does he asked daddy seriously Perhaps we had better
look through my Wardrobe in his behest

But Daddy he cant wear your clothes Hed be lost in them
Janice giggled

True But his mother may know how to cut the garments down and
make them over for the boy You ask her Janice I will lay out
a couple of suits that I will never be able to wear again

And so they forgot their own troubles for the time being in
seeking to relieve those of some other people



CHAPTER XI MRS WATKINS

Although it was probable that most of the Days neighbors felt
more or less curiosity if not interest in their domestic
misfortunes it was only Miss Peckham who seemed to keep really
close observation in season and out of all that went on in and
about the Day house

Janice could have wished that the spinster would give more of her
attention to her cats and Ambrose the parrot and less to
neighborhood affairs For the child knew that not even a peddler
came to the door that the sharpvisaged woman behind her bowed
blinds did watch to see what Janice did

She watches every move I make Daddy complained the girl one
day I dont see why she cares who comes to see me Shes the
meanest thing

Now Janice dear

I dont care Daddy just this once Why this afternoon three
of the girls were here and after they left Miss Peckham called
me over to the fence and asked me when the Beemans were going to
Canada

The Beemans talk of going there before long but are not certain
about it and Annette told the rest of us girls all about it as a
great secret Miss Peckham

deliberately listened at her window and then because she
couldnt hear all we said she tried to make me tell her the
whole story Now isnt that mean

Oh well Janice

You wouldnt listen like that Daddy Day and you wouldnt let
me so there

Maybe not Janice But then you know we do many things that
Miss Peckham does not approve ofmany things that she would not
think of doing

Now Daddy you are joking You know you are

Maybe sohalf way But then we are responsible for ourselves
and not for Miss Peckham But I am sorry daughter that she
troubles you Perhaps he added more lightly we shall get
things on a more satisfactory basis here before long and then
Miss Peckham will not think it necessary to look after us so
much

You know better than that Daddy Day Miss Peckham will look
after us till we are hundreds of years old answered Janice
But now she spoke with a smile on her lips

The disappointment of the coming and going of Bridget Burns made
both father and daughter shrink from trying another houseworker
unless she appeared more than ordinarily promising So for a day
or two daddy went personally to the agencies and looked the
prospective workers over His reports to Janice were not
hopeful

Oh dear me Daddy Janice sighed I do wish I could do it
all Maybe I ought only to go to school part time

No my dear We will scrabble along as best we can You must
not neglect the studies

At any rate she exclaimed it will soon be vacation time I
can do ever so much more in the house then

Nor do I believe that is a good plan her father said shaking
his head The best thing that could happen to you would be for
you to go away for a change I have a good mind to send you back
East Your Aunt Almira

Oh Daddy Never You dont mean it cried the girl

Why youll like your Aunt Almira Of course Jase Day is not
such an upandcoming chap as one might wish but he is a good
sort at that And there is your cousin Marty

But I dont know any of them sighed Janice And I dont want
to leave you

But if we cannot get any help

Ill get along What would you do in this house alone if I went
away she demanded

Id shut it up and go down to the Laurel House to board

Oh thats awful

No I get my lunch there now Its not very bad said Broxton
Day smiling

I mean its awful to think of shutting up our home for the
summer You havent got to go away to Mexico have you Daddy
she queried with sudden suspicion

Well my dear it may be necessary he confessed

And youd send me away to Vermont while you were gone

I dont know what else to doif the necessity arises Jase Day
is my halfbrotherthe only living relative I have Your
mothers people are all scattered I wouldnt know what else to
do with you my dear

Mercy she sighed winking back the tears it sounds as though
II were what you call a liability in your bank business
Isnt that it Why Daddy I want to be an asset not a
liability

Bless you my dear you are A great big asset he laughed
But you must not neglect the necessary preparation for life
which your studies give you Nor must I let you overwork Have
patienceand hope Perhaps we shall be able to find a really
good housekeeper after all

When on Wednesday afternoons Janice came home from school she
saw Miss Peckham beckoning to her from her front porch the girl
had no suspicion that the maiden lady was about to interfere in
her and daddys affairs No indeed

Now I wonder what she wants murmured Janice going reluctantly
toward the Peckham house And shes got company too

The spinster was sitting on her porch behind the honeysuckle
vines with her sewing table and the big parrot Ambrose chained
to his perch beside her There was too a second woman on the
porch

Good afternoon Miss Peckham Janice said swinging her books
as she came up the walk from Miss Peckhams gate Hello
Polly

Polly wants cracker declared the bird flapping his wings and
doing a funny little dance on his perch

Be still commanded Miss Peckham With her sharp little black
eyes she glanced from Janice to the other woman This is the
girl she said

Janice feeling as though she was under some important scrutiny
looked at the second woman in curiosity She found her a not
unpleasant looking person She was much wrinkled yet her cheeks
were rather pink and her lips very vivid Janice wondered if it
was possible that this color was put on by hand

The woman sat in a rocking chair with her long hands folded idly
in her lap On the hands were white half mitssomething
Janice knew were long out of fashion but which were once
considered very stylish indeed

The womans eyes were a shallow brown colorperhaps faded
would be a better expression It seemed as though she were too
languid even to look with attention at any one or anything

This is the girl Sophrony Miss Peckham repeated more sharply

Oh yes murmured the strange woman as though awakened from a
brown study Yes Quite a pretty little girl

Pretty is as pretty does scoffed Miss Peckham At any rate
shes healthy Aint you Janice Day

Ahohyes maam stammered Janice I guess I am

Well I dont see the doctor going to your house none said
Miss Peckham in her snappy way I guess I would ha seen him
if hed called

Oh yes agreed Janice you would have seen him

Heh Miss Peckham stared at the little girl sharply But she
saw that Janice was quite innocent in making her comment
Well said the maiden lady this is Mrs Watkins

Considering this an introduction Janice came forward and offered
the faded looking woman her hand Mrs Watkins own hand
reminded Janice of a dead fish and she was quite as glad to drop
it as Mrs Watkins seemed to be to have it dropped

Oh yes said the latter woman she is a pretty girl

Mrs Watkins has come to see me explained Miss Peckham She
an I have been friends for years and years We used to go to
school together when we were girls

Oh said Janice But she could think of nothing else to say
She did not understand why she was being taken into Miss
Peckhams confidence

Yes Sophrony Watkins and ISophrony Shepley was her maiden
name She married Tom Watkinsand Tom was a shiftless critter
if there ever was one

Janice was startled Miss Peckham seemed to be unnecessarily
plain spoken But the languid Mrs Watkins made no comment

And now Sophrony has come down to doin for herself went on
the neighborhood censor I sent for her to come over here
Shes been livin in Marietteville You tell your pa that well
come into see him tonight after supper

Oh murmured Janice Then she remembered her manners and
said smiling Please do Miss Peckham I will tell daddy you
are coming

Miss Peckham waved her hand to dismiss her young neighbor And
if twas me she said complacently to her companion first
thing Id do would be to cure that young one of calling her
father daddy Thats silly

Even this remark did not forewarn Janice of what was coming I
just believe she thought going on her way that that
fadedout little woman is a book agent and will want to sell
daddy a set of books hell never in this world read

But in getting dinner and tidying up the dining room and living
room Janice forgot all about Mrs Sophronia Watkins Janice was
working very hard these days much harder than any girl of her
age should work The evening before she had fallen asleep over
her studies and today her recitations had not been quite up to
the mark

The lack of system in the housekeeping made everything harder for
her too It was all right for daddy to help wash the dinner
dishes and even to blacken the range and the gas stove as he did
on this evening but there were dozens of things going wrong
every day in the house which neither Janice nor her father could
help

There were the provision bills Janice knew very well that the
butcher took advantage of her ignorance She was always in a
hurry in the morning running to school and she could not stop
to see meat weighed or vegetables properly picked out and
measured

At Mr Harrimans the grocers it was not so bad There were
certain articles of established standard that she knew her mother
had always ordered but in the matter of butter and cheese and
eggs she realized that she often ordered the best and got
second or third quality and firstquality prices

Had she been able to spend the time marketing she would have
conserved some of daddys money and things would have been much
better on the table Yet with the kind of houseworkers they had
had much of the good food that was bought was spoiled in the
cooking

Daddy sometimes said The Lord sends the food but the cooks
dont all come from heaven that is sure Janice

He was vigorously polishing the cookstove on this Wednesday
evening and they were cheerfully talking and joking when the
sound of bootheels on the side porch announced the coming of
visitors

Oh dear me who can that be whispered Janice

Save me My Ladysave me cried daddy appearing to be very
much frightened and dodging behind the stove Dont let the
neighbors in until I have got rid of this blacking brush and got
on my vest and coat

But the caller who now hammered on the door with quick knuckles
was no bashful person Mr Day had no chance to escape from the
kitchen Miss Peckham turned the knob and walked right in

Come in Sophrony she said over her shoulder to the person
who came behind her You can see well enough that this man and
his gal need somebody to take hold for em Come right in



CHAPTER XII THE FADEDOUT LADY

Janice was not as much surprisedat first as her father was by
the appearance of the spinster and Mrs Watkins She remembered
that Miss Peckham had said she would call this evening although
the girl had not expected her at the back door

Their neighbor had managed to time her appearance at a rather
inopportune moment and when daddy rose up from behind the stove
to confront the two women in a voluminous apron and with a
smutch across his cheek Janice could not entirely smother her
amusement

Oh Oh she giggled Good evening Miss Peckham Thisthis
is Mrs Watkins Daddy and she directed her fathers attention
to the fadedout lady Ahem I am glad to see you Miss
Peckhamand Mrs Watkins Mr Day said bowing in that nice way
of his that Janice so much admired Even with a blacking brush
in one hand and a can of stove polish in the other Mr Broxton
Day was very much the gentleman

You find us considerably engaged in domestic work continued
Mr Day a smile wreathing his lips and his eyes twinkling And
if you dont mind Ill finish my job before giving you my full
attention Janice take

Miss Peckham and her friend into the living room

Oh no You neednt bother said Miss Peckham shortly
Heres chairs and we can sit down Its interesting to watch a
man try to do housework Ive no doubt

You said something then Miss Peckham said Mr Day
cheerfully and began industriously daubing the stove covers

I brought Mrs Watkins in here to see you Mr Day cause I got
your welfare and hers at heart pursued the spinster

That sounded rather ominous and Mr Day poised the dauber and
stared doubtfully from his neighbor to the washedout looking
woman

Mrs Watkins is a widow went on Miss Peckham

Mr Day made a sympathetic sound with his lips but fell to
polishing now making the stove covers rattle Miss Peckham
raised her voice a notch Shes a widow and shes seen
trouble

Were born to itas the sparks fly upward observed
Mr Day under his breath

Mrs Watkins has come to an age when nobody can say shes
flighty I shd hope continued Miss Peckham Shes settled
And shes got to earn her livin

Now Marthy objected Mrs Watkins

Well tis so Sophrony aint it demanded her friend

Oh of course expenses are heavy and its desirable that I
shouldshouldwell add to my income But Ive come to no
great age Marthy Peckham Id have you know

Oh bosh Sophrony ejaculated Miss Peckham Well as I say
Mr Day Mrs Watkins is a widow and she needs a settled place

Just what are you trying to get at Miss Peckham I dont
understand you asked Mr Day his face actually getting rather
pale

Neither did Janice understand but her father looked so funny
that the girl giggled again Miss Peckham gave her a reproving
glance

I shd think youd understand your need well enough Broxton
Day she said sternly First of all that gal ought to be
learned manners But thats incidental as you might say What
I am tellin you is that heres your chance to get a housekeeper
thatll amount to something

Oh Ah I see exclaimed Mr Day in staccato fashion and
evidently very much relieved Mrs Watkins is looking for a
position

Well she ought to be But it does take a stick of dynamite to
get her goin seems to me Speak up Sophrony

Why Im pleased to meet you Mr Day said the fadedout lady
simpering Ive been considerin acceptin a position such as
you have Of course I aint used to working out

Oh fiddlesticks put in Miss Peckham He dont care nothin
about that Sophrony He can see you aint no common servant

Assuredly I can see that Mrs Watkins said Mr Day suavely
But do you think you would care to accept such a position as I
can offer you

I should be pleased to try it said Mrs Watkins with a sigh
Of course it would be a comedown for me

Lands sake Sophrony ejaculated her friend with me to
sponsor you I dont guess anybody in this neighborhood will
undertake to criticize

Wait a moment said Mr Day and Janice was delighted to see
that he was not entirely carried off his feet Let us understand
each other I pay so much a month naming a fair sum and I
expect the cooking and all the housework except the heavy washing
done by whoever takes the place

Well now Mr Day began Mrs Watkins you see I shouldnt
expect to be treated just like an ordinary servant Oh no

Thats what I tell her snorted Miss Peckham

Folks that have had the offscourings of the earth like you
have had Broxton Day in your kitchen aint used to having
ladyhelp about the house

I hope Janice and I will appreciate Mrs Watkins efforts if
she wishes to try the place Mr Day said in rather a
bewildered tone

That gal herself can do a good deal I shd think morning and
night She aint helpless said Miss Peckham staring at
Janice

Janice has her school work to do said Mr Day firmly She
takes care of her own room and does other little things But
unless Mrs Watkins wishes to undertake the full responsibility
of the housework it would be useless for her to come

He was firm on that point The fadedout lady smiled feebly I
am always willing to do as far as I can she sighed The work
for three people cant be so much I am perfectly willing to
try Mr Day Im sure nothin could be fairer than that

Daddy and Janice looked at each other for an instant It flashed
through both their minds that the fadedout lady did not sound
very encouraging Later when the two had gone daddy put away
the blacklug tools saying

Well it will be a new experience Janice She is different
from anybody we have ever had before

Oh Daddy I think shes funny gasped the girl

He smiled at her broadly shaking his head I presume she does
seem funny to you But at least she is a ladylike person We
must treat her nicely

Why as though we wouldnt gasped Janice

But dont offend her by showing her you are amused warned her
father That may be hard for it does strike me that Mrs
Sophronia Watkins is a character and no mistake

I wouldnt hurt her feelings for the world declared Janice
But Daddy do you suppose it is rouge she has on her face And
does she use a lipstick

For goodness sake Where did you hear about such things he
laughed

Why of course I know something about most everything declared
Janice quite confidently And her face doesnt look just
natural

Dont get too curious Janice he said laughing If she can
cook and keep the house clean as far as I am concerned she can
paint herself like a Piute chief

One shock however Mr Broxton Day was not exactly prepared for
Mrs Watkins came to the house the next day for a late
breakfastwhich she got herself Janice and her father having
already cooked their own and eaten it

I havent been used to getting up very early confessed the
woman preening a bit But of course I shall change my
breakfast hour to conform with yours

I hope so said Broxton Day hurrying away to business

He got the shock mentioned at night when he came to the dinner
table The table was very neatly set but there were three
places The meal was not elaborate but the food seemed to be
cooked all right Mrs Watkins brought in the dishes and then
sat down with Mr Day and Janice to eat

Janice did not look at daddy but her own face was rather red and
she was uncomfortable

Your daughter said Mrs Watkins severely informs me that you
have not been in the habit of having anybody at your table at
meal time but your two selves Of course I could only engage to
assist you here with the understanding that I am to be considered
one of the family

Whyeryes that will be all right Janices father said
though a bit doubtfully It would scarcely do to consider you
Mrs Watkins in the same category as the ordinary help Janice
and I have had

I am glad you see it that way said the fadedout lady And
she was quite colorless at the moment It was evident that the
rouge and lipstick were used only on important occasions

I am glad you see it that way she repeated I could consider
no letdown as a lady in accepting any position Manual labor
is no shame but one must be true to ones upbringing

Quite so Mrs Watkinsquite so agreed Mr Day

Janice child said the woman quickly run out to the kitchen
and get the rest of the potatoes And see if the coffee is
ready

Her tone rather startled Janice but she did as she was bade and
that without even a glance at daddy

I never consider I have had a real dinner Mrs Watkins
continued unless I have a bit of good cheese with it I find
none in the house Mr Day Indeed she added your pantry
sadly needs stocking up

Whyerthat may be so We have been living a good deal
catchascatchcan and he smiled upon her Give Janice a
list of the things you need and she will go to Harrimans for
you in the morning

No I prefer to do my own marketing always A child like
Janicethank you Janice for the potatoes can scarcely be
expected to use judgment in the selection of provisions You
might telephone to the stores where you are in the habit of
trading and inform them that I have charge of your household now
They will then expect me

Oh well All right he said but doubtfully

I have not yet brought my bag from Marthys next door I will
go after it when dinner is over while Janice clears the table
I will send for my trunk which is at Marietteville later

Suit yourself Mrs Watkins said Mr Day

Have you any choice as to which of the two empty bedrooms I
consider mine the woman asked heaping her plate a second time
with food

Whats that asked Mr Day rather nonplussed

Which chamber shall I sleep in she repeated quite calmly

WhyI Really Mrs Watkins isnt the small room beyond
Janices quite sufficient for you he asked a little color
coming into his face now

Oh my dear Mr Day I could not consider that for a moment
Why that is the girls roommerely a bedroom for the hired
help I could not possibly consider myself in the same class

Except on payday Mrs Watkins asked the man bluntly We
are glad to have you with us of course and we will consider
your quite different status in the family as you demand But

No Mr Day Mrs Watkins said with decision interrupting him
I could not contemplate for a moment occupying the girls room
Why you might want it again any time

Not while you are with us said Mr Day wonderingly I do not
think I could afford to have two helpers

It does not matter said the fadedout lady stubbornly
Janice get the coffee now It does not matter I refuse
positively to sleep in that little pokedup room I prefer my
windows opening to the east

But the east room is the one Mrs Day always used said the
man with sudden hoarseness I cannot allow you to use that
one The spare chamber on the other side of the hall if you
insist

Very well said the woman with a small toss of her head Will
you have a cup of coffee Mr Day

No Mrs Watkins I prefer a cup of tea at dinner time A New
England habit that has clung to me

Indeed Janice go and make your father a cup of tea thats a
good child

Never mind Janice said daddy quickly I do not wish it now
And Mrs Watkins

Yes Mr Day simpered the fadedout lady

I wish it distinctly understood that Janice is to give her
complete attention to her school work between dinner and bedtime
unless she should chance to have more freedom during those hours
than is usual She will assist you as you may have need after
school and even in the morning before she goes to school But
the hours after dinner are for her school work Do you quite
understand me Mrs Watkins

Mrs Watkins pale wrinkled face did not color in the least nor
did the washedout brown eyes change their expression But there
was an added sharpness to the womans voice

You object to Janices giving me a hand with the lighter tasks
Mr Day she queried

Not at all But her education must not be neglected

Ah I quite understand sniffed Mrs Watkins You object to
my going out this evening then But I really must have my bag
with my toilet requisites

I have no wish to restrict your use of the evening as long as
your work is done said Mr Day rising from the table Come
Janice it is time you were at your books

He led the way into the living room Mrs Watkins gave a violent
sniff at their departure Then she finished her coffee



CHAPTER XIII STELLAS PARTY

It was not going to be altogether pleasant sailing with Mrs
Watkins in the house Broxton Day saw that to be the fact
plainly and almost immediately Janice had realized it even
before her father had occasion to mark Mrs Watkins most
prominent characteristic

She was a person who was determined to take advantage if she
could In the parlance of the section of the country from which
Broxton Day hailed she was one of those persons who if you give
em an inch they take an ell

From the first she made a strong attempt to carry things with a
high hand Mr Day was almost sorry he had allowed her to come
into the house Mrs Watkins did most of the housekeeping from
her station in a rocking chair on the porch where she sat
wearing the mitts aforementioned

Her idea of keeping the house in order was to clean all the rooms
that were not absolutely needed and then close them up tight
draw the shades down and close the blinds making of each an
airless tomb into which Janice was made to feel she must not
enter for fear of admitting a speck of dirt

Most of the work was done on Saturday when Janice was at home
There was no playtime now for the girl none at all

But Janice would not complain Mrs Watkins could be very mean
and petty indeed but to daddy she showed her best side And as
far as he saw the house was run much better than had been the
case of late

Mrs Watkins was ladylike in her demeanor They became used to
her sitting at the table with them and quite governing the trend
of conversation at meals as she did Neither Janice nor her
father liked to have the woman bring her tatting which was her
usual evening employment into the livingroom after dinner for
that was the only time when daughter and father could be
confidential But they did not see how they could overcome this
annoyance without offending the woman

At the end of the month Mr Day was startled by the increase in
the household bills Mrs Watkins had served them rather better
food it was true than they had been getting of late but a good
many cutlets sweetbreads chops and steaks seemed never to have
appeared on the dinner table

I always feel the need of a hearty lunch Mr Day sniffed Mrs
Watkins I really need it after doing the mornings work To
keep ones self in condition is a duty we owe ourselves dont you
think

You seem to have stocked up pretty well with canned goods Mrs
Watkins was Broxton Days rejoinder now scanning the long
memorandum from Harrimans Dear dear French peas And
imported marmalade And canned mushrooms Do you use all these
things Mrs Watkins

Oh they are most useful Mr Day One never knows when one may
have company or wish to make a special dish I have been used to
the best Mr Day Of course if you wish to limit my
purchases and she sniffed

Humph I am not a rich man We are not in the habit of using
imported provisions of this quality I expect you to buy good
food and all that is sufficient But such luxuries as these we
cannot afford

Mrs Watkins merely sniffed again Broxton Day when he paid the
bills at the stores pointed out to Mr Harriman and to the
butcher that the goods bought seemed to cost considerably more
than they previously had

Why Mr Day you are buying a different quality of goods from
what you have been used to said Harriman Heres butter for
instance That is our best print butter seven cents a pound
higher than the tub butter you used to buy Those eggs are
selected white Leghorns come to us sealed in boxes and are
fifteen cents more a dozen than ordinary fresh eggs

The butcher told him something else Yes you are getting the
best grade of everything we carry Mr Day That lady at your
house evidently knows what she wants

Look here exclaimed Broxton Day with some heat I havent
suddenly become a millionaire I cant stand these prices When
she comes in here to buy give her the grade of meat we have
always had And remember that I cant and wont pay for
sweetbreads at a dollar and a half a pair

Why bless you said the butcher grinning Ive never seen
the lady She always telephones Shes some relative of yours
isnt she Mr Day She certainly does order highhanded

And she wanted to do the marketing herself groaned Broxton
Day as he went away after paying the bill I wonder what I am
up against Things do go better at the house but I wonder if I
can stand the pressure

He did not know how much Janice had to do with making things at
the house go so much more smoothly The little girl was
determined that daddy should not be troubled by household matters
if she could help it

With Olga Cedarstrom or the halffoolish Delia in the house it
was impossible to keep from daddys eyes the things that went
wrong Now it was different Mrs Watkins was very sly in
making everything appear all right before Broxton Day On the
other hand Janice showed an equal amount of slyness of which she
had been previously accused in helping hide the numerous things
that would have troubled daddy

There was waste in the kitchen Mrs Watkins was a big eater
but a delicate eater She never wished to see the same thing on
the table twice A poor family could have been fed fairly well
from what the woman flung into the garbage

Janice had never been used to seeing such recklessness even when
only an ignorant servant was doing the work At those times food
was bought with a less lavish hand Now there was seldom anything
left so Mrs Watkins said from one meal to warm up for another

I dont know what to doI really dont Janice confessed to
Any Carringford who by this time had become her very closest
friend and confidante Daddy has many business troubles I
know It bothers him greatly to be annoyed by household matters
And he ought not to be so annoyed But that woman

It is too bad honey Amy said I wish my mother could help
you She knows everything about housekeeping

I know that is so agreed Janice I wish Mrs Watkins was a
lady like your mother Amy Then the house would go all right
and daddy neednt be bothered at all I feel I ought to do
something but I dont know what

Aside from cooking the meals which she did very nicely it must
be confessed Mrs Watkins gradually allowed most of the
responsibility for the housework to slide on to Janices young
shoulders

The young girl got up an hour earlier than usual and she busied
herself sweeping and dusting and making beds right up to the
minute she had to seize her books and lunch and run to school
She was quite sure that Mrs Watkins went back to bed after
breakfast and really did little towards keeping the house in
order until afternoon

And if there was any scrubbing or hard work to do that was left
until Saturday Nobody ever saw Mrs Watkins on her knees
unless it was at her devotions

However Janice Day was too sanguine to be made melancholy by
these affairs She was of a naturally cheerful naturean
attribute she inherited from her father It took more than the
fadedout lady to cause the girl overwhelming anxiety

The stroke that had been the hardest for her to bear since her
mothers death was the loss of the treasurebox and the heirlooms
in it Whether or not the Swedish girl Olga Cedarstrom had
carried the valuables away with her Janice felt all the time
that she had only herself to blame because of the loss And she
realized that the loss of the packet of letters had saddened
daddy dreadfully

If I had not been careless If I had put the box back into the
wallsafe before I went to bed If I had remembered when I saw
Arlo Junior and the cats Dear me murmured Janice more than
once If if if If the rabbit hadnt stopped for a nap
beside the track the tortoise would not have won the race

But what under the sun Gummy Carringford asked could have
become of Olga and her fella That is certainly a mystery

With Amy and her brother the boy with the odd name Janice often
discussed the lost treasurebox She and daddy did not speak so
much together about it as at first It seemed to be hopelessly
lost

With the Carringfords Janice had become very friendly as has
been said In the first place Mrs Carringford very much liked
Janice Day And how could she and her children help but be
grateful to the little girl who lived at Eightfortyfive Knight
Street

The birthday party at Stella Lathams house was now at hand
Mrs Carringford had not yet been able to make over Mr Days
clothes to fit Gummy and he was not invited to the party
anyway He was one grade in advance of the three girls in
school and Stella considered this excuse enough for not inviting
him to her birthday fete But Amy was radiant in the pink and
white frock Janice had donated

Never mind said Gummy who was of a cheerful spirit too
Im glad the party will be on Friday instead of Saturday night
Ill be out of the store early enough Friday night to come to the
Latham place to beau you girls home

Maybe well have beaux of our own and wont want you said Amy
roguishly

Dont mind what she says Gummy cried Janice I wont have
any beau but you I shall expect you So dont fail me

Stella Lathams expectations had been high indeed regarding her
party nor was she disappointed Her father and mother had done
everything they thought would please their only daughter and
surely the cost had not been considered

The house and the grounds around it were charmingly
lightedthe outside lamps being those gaudy and curious forms
containing lighted candles and called Japanese lanterns

The Latham place on the Dover pike was one of the show places of
the countryside Mr Latham was wealthy and could well afford to
give his daughters friends an entertainment that might better
perhaps have been offered older guests

Stella was growing up too fast Because she was aping older and
foolishly fashionable folk she was becoming an exacting
precocious girlnot at all the innocent and joyous child she
should have been at fourteen years of age

Her mother feared that all was not right with Stella yet she was
too weak and easygoing a woman to correct her daughter with a
strong hand She had observed Janice Day on two occasions when
the latter had come with other young friends of Stellas to the
house and had commented favorably upon Janices character

There is a girl you might pattern after Stella and it would do
you good said the somewhat unwise Mrs Latham

Humph I dont see why you say that Ma said Stella Janice
Day isnt half as pretty as Mary Pierce And she dresses in half
mourning because of her mothers death She hasnt got any style
about her

She is a very shrewd and sensible young person declared Mrs
Latham I wish you were more like her

It was from this remark that Stella had derived the statement
that Janice was sly That term quite justly might have been
applied to Stella For Stella would have cared very little if
neither Janice nor Amy Carringford had come to the birthday
party

Only Mr Latham had insisted that his daughter should invite
every girl in her grade at school He was wiser than his wife

You dont want any illfeelings among your mates he told
Stella

Janice Day therefore whether shrewd or sly had helped
Stella in the matter of fulfilling Mr Lathams command Amy as
sweet as a rose appeared in the pretty pink and white dress that
had been made by the dear fingers of Janices mother

At first Janice could scarcely look at her friend in the frock
without feeling the tears start to her eyes But thenshe knew
that mother would have approved fully of this gift she had made
And Amy Carringford was good and attractive

There was such a large number of young folks at the Latham place
that evening that when it came time for the refreshments every
one of the farmers hired help was called in either as waiters
or in the kitchen

It took a good many waiters too for there were many steps to be
taken back and forth to the kitchen Mr Latham had had a large
canvas canopy stretched out in one corner of the yard and under
this were set the tables And pretty indeed did they look
under the soft lights of the numerous candles in their shiny
whiteness of heavy napery polished silver dainty porcelain and
brilliant cutglass

What appealed more however to the hearty appetites of the young
people were the quantifies of sandwiches the olives and pickles
and the bowls of salad the rich cakes the heaps of icecream
the hot chocolate The Lathams were lavish at all times and
when they gave a formal party the table was heaped with the
richest and most delicious food they could provide No wonder it
took many hands to make things run smoothly

Goodness said Stella within hearing of Janice and Amy
theres such a crowd in that kitchen youve no idea And some
of the help are perfectly useless You know mother had the
folks come up from both tenant houses to help and one of the
womenthe Swedish one has just broken one of mothers biggest
cutglass dishes

I thought I heard a crash out there said Janice

It is too bad Amy added Of course the woman did not mean
to

Well sniffed Stella that wont make the dish whole Its
worth money too

Dear me said Amy reflectively I guess Swedish girls must be
bad luck You know it was a Swedish girl that stole that box
from Janice

What box asked Stella quickly A jewel box

All the jewelry I owned said Janice with rather a rueful
smile But more than that Mothers miniature and other
things At least we suppose that Olga took the box when she
left us so hurriedly

Olga exclaimed Stella Fancy You dont mean that was her
name

Yes Olga she was called Janice said wonderingly

Thats the name Of this girl that broke the dish

Why how funny exclaimed Amy

Thats not funny rejoined Janice seriously Is she named
Olga Cedarstrom

Goodness I dont know her last name She comes from one of
our tenant houses Its far away Mother sent her home with a
flea in her ear now I tell you after she had broken that dish

Janice was disturbed I wish you knew her last name What sort
of looking girl is she Are you sure she has already left the
house

Come on cried Amy jumping up Lets run around there and
see Take us to the kitchen door Stella

Well yes We can look But I guess she has gone said the
farmers daughter

They had been sitting on the front porch Stella led them
quickly around to the rear of the big house



CHAPTER XIV COULD IT BE OLGA

It was a beautiful evening this of Stella Lathams birthday
party It was not often that the climate gave the people of
Greensboro this early in the season such a soft and temperate
night

There was no moon but the stars plentifully besprinkled the
heavens and their light bathed the area surrounding the Latham
house beyond the radiance of the Japanese lanterns sufficiently
for the three girls to see objects at some distance

Before they reached the back door of the farmhouse Amy cried
aloud

Oh girls Whats that A ghost

Ghost your granny exclaimed Stella That is somebody running
along the hedge in a white skirt

It is a woman or a girl Janice agreed staring at the rapidly
moving figure Is there a path there

That is the path to one tenant house Wait till I ask Anna the
cook

She hurried to the back door and her two friends waiting at the
pasturelane bars heard her ask if the woman who had broken the
dish had gone

The awkward thing exclaimed Anna the cook Shes just this
minute left

What is her name Anna asked Stella knowing that Janice was
deeply interested

I dont know Miss Some outlandish Swedish name

Olga

Humph Maybe

Olga Cedarstrom

Goodness me Dont ask me what else besides Olga she is
named said the irritable cook for I couldnt tell you I
couldnt tell you my own name scarcely tonight Im that
flurried

Hearing all this plainly Janice murmured to Amy I wish I dared
follow her Suppose it should be Olga

Well she is going right to that small house that belongs to Mr
Latham Stella says she lives there whoever she is

Just then a figure popped up beside them Gummys cheerful voice
demanded

Whats the trouble girls

Oh cried Janice

Goodness said the boys sister How you scare one Gummy
Why it isnt near time to go home

I got off earlier than I expected So I came out and have been
hanging around at the back here for half an hour

Oh Gummy did you see that woman Janice asked seizing his
jacket sleeve

What woman

See there cried his sister pointing That white thing going
over the hill

Yes I saw her She came out of the kitchen and she was
crying They had a row in there

Oh Gummy What did she look like murmured Janice

Yes Gummy tell us quick urged his sister

I tell you she was crying and she had her handkerchief up to
her face So I did not see much of it But her hair was lasses
color and she had it bobbed back so tight that I guess she
couldnt shut her eyes until she undid it chuckled Gummy

Oh Amy ejaculated Janice with clasped hands that is the
way Olga used to do her hair

Not Olga the Swede who robbed you demanded the boy
interested at once

Yes It might be Olga If you had only seen her face

Ill see her face all right declared Gummy starting off
Ill tell you just where she goes and what she looks like
Dont you girls go home without me

He was gone on the track of the flying woman like a dart He was
out of sight being in dark garments before Stella came back
from the kitchen door

Dont tell her about Gummy whispered Amy quickly Shell
think maybe that hes been hanging around like those strange
boys over the fence in front

Not a word agreed Janice smiling I wouldnt give Gummy
away

There isnt anybody in the kitchen who knows that girl very
well said Stella who was really showing herself interested in
Janice Days trouble I asked them all This girl Olga is
staying with Mrs Johnson Mrs Johnson has a little baby to
care for and couldnt come tonight So this friend of hers came
up to help And she helped all right concluded Stella with
emphasis That dish is in a thousand pieces

Isnt it too bad said Amy sympathetically

Its a mean shame Stella declared I bet shed steal Youd
better come over here tomorrow and find her Ill bring you back
in the auto with me after I go shopping and well ride around by
Mr Johnsons house Hes one of fathers farmers you know

Ill tell daddy Janice said but in some doubt Im awfully
much obliged to you Stella You are real kind

This pleased Stella Latham She liked being praised and as long
as kindness did not cost her much of anything she was glad to be
kind

The entertainment of her boy and girl friends continued gaily
despite the breaking of the big cutglass dish It was almost
eleven oclock when the party broke up and the guests began to
leave shouting their congratulations to Stella as they went

Janice and Amy Carringford found Gummy waiting for them at the
front gate

Oh Gummy whispered Janice did you see her

Sure declared the boy Thats what I went after wasnt it
A sight of the Swedish girls phisamahogany

Gummy remonstrated his sister

But was it Olga demanded Janice too deeply interested in the
subject of Olga to be patient with sisterly reproof

Oh say How can I be sure of that I never saw her before

Tell us all about it Gummy urged Janice

Why you see said the excited boy I rans hard as I could
and I overbrook that girl at the took

What What gasped Janice Say that again Gummy

OhI

His sister went off into a gale of laughter Oh Gummy she
cried you overbrook her at the took did you Your
tongues twisted again

Oh pshaw exclaimed Gummy Of course I mean I overtook her
at the brook

Thats better giggled Amy But you did get awfully gummed
up Gummy didnt you

Huh he snorted

Hes the most awful boy you ever saw Janice He is always
getting twisted in his talk

Like the young man in church who asked the girl if he could
occupew a seat in this pie

Even worse than that cried Amy much to her brothers disgust
Why years ago when we lived in Napsburg where the twins were
born he made an awful mistakeand to our minister too

Aw objected Gummy cant you keep anything to yourself

Go on urged Janice

Now I say again protested the boy

Listen Janice giggled Amy Its awfully funny The minister
met Gummy on the street and asked him what we had decided to call
the twins

You know I expect to christen them Gumswith he said to
Gummy and I want to be sure to get the names right What are
they

And what do you suppose Gummy said

I am sure I couldnt guess Janice declared Lets see the
twins are Sydney and Kate arent they

That is right giggled Amy But Gummy told the minister we
had decided to call them Kidney and Steak

Janice herself was convulsed with laughter at this Gummy was
annoyed about it

Why dont you keep something to yourself once in a while Amy
he growled to his sister Janice will think Im a perfect
chump

Come on now Gummy Janice interrupted cheerily You are
keeping something to yourself that I very much want to know

Oh About that Swede Amy knocked it clear out of my head
declared the boy

Well let us hear about it urged Janice

Why I overtook the girl at the brook said Gummy getting the
statement right this time She might be just the girl you are
looking for from what you told me about her looks I saw her
face plainly when I passed her

Where did she go

To that little house at the end of the farm road just where it
opens into the turnpike Oh Ive seen the place before I
drove out past there the other day for Mr Harriman

That must be the Johnsons house Janice said That is what
Stella said the tenants name was

Well she went in there said Gummy She seemed in a dreadful
hurry She pounded on the door and she called to them in
Swedish I waited behind the hedge until she got in and the
family was quieted down again

Thats good Its most sure to be Olga Janice and you can
see her tomorrow and get your box backat least find out where
it is said Amy encouragingly

Well Ill tell daddy sighed Janice It may be the same
Olga I hope so And if she has got my box of treasureswell
Ill forgive her anything if I only get back mothers picture and
daddys letters



CHAPTER XV THE LOST TRAIL

Mr Day had not yet gone to bed when the young folks reached the
house but Mrs Watkins had long since retired The light in the
living room assured Janice that her father awaited her return
and bidding Amy and Gummy goodnight at the gate she ran into
the house in great excitement

Oh Daddy Daddy Guess she cried to him Just think She
broke a big cutglass dish and Im most sure its Olga

Wait exclaimed Mr Day putting up both hands Mercy I
pray my dear I dont know what you are talking about

But you know Olga Daddy

To my sorrow he groaned It cant be that you have found out
anything about that Swedish girl I have been searching
Pickletown again this evening

Oh Daddy she cried maybe Olga is just where you can find
her tomorrow And she did break one of Mrs Lathams very best
dishes and

Let us hear all about this in due order laughed Broxton Day
I can see that you are far too much excited to go promptly to
bed Explain yourself my dear

When he had heard it all he did not appear to be as much
impressed as Janice expected him to be It was a small chance
in his opinion that the girl who had broken Mrs Lathams dish
was the same Olga who had for two months held sway in the Day
kitchen

But we will make a pilgrimage to the cottage on the back of the
Latham farm Daddy promised If I can get away from the bank
early tomorrow afternoon we will go I know the place and
there is a family of Swedish people living there Of course by
chance it might be Olga your friend Gummy followed home

Oh no It would be providential Daddy Janice declared
smiling You say yourself that Providence is not chance

True he agreed with gravity If we get back the
treasurebox with all in it I shall be very very thankful
indeed and shall consider it a Providential happening

Daddy dear whispered Janice

It was at these times when they spoke of the lost treasures
that Janice was so heartstricken because of daddys expression
of countenance Those letters from her dear dead mother which
her father prized so highly were continually in Broxton Days
mind She realized it was a loss that time would hardly mend

And all my fault All my fault she sobbed when she was alone
in her bedroom Had I not been so dreadfully careless Olga
would never have got hold of that box when she was mad and run
off with it And suppose she doesnt think the things in it are
worth much She might throw them away

So despite the good time they had had at Stella Lathams party
Janice went to bed in no happy frame of mind

Saturday was bound to be a very busy day and Janice did not wake
up early Daddy left a note for her on the table saying he would
be at home with some kind of a conveyance not long after the bank
closed at one oclock

She knew what that meant They were to ride out to the Johnson
house and make inquiries for the girl Olga Janice was sorry she
had slept so late for Mrs Watkins expected her to do what she
termed her share of the work

If your pa lets you sit up till all hours so that youre not
fit for anything in the morning should I be blamed complained
the fadedout lady Im sure I have enough to do every day and
all day I have got to have some help on Saturdays and that is
all there is to it

Janice knew well enough that the reason the work piled up so upon
the last day of the week was because it was allowed to accumulate
through the other days But the kitchen floor did have to be
scrubbed It was a sight

If the woman would only mop it every other day it would not be so
bad but it seemed to Janice that Mrs Watkins would just wade
through dirt to her knees in the kitchen before she would use
either mop or scrubbing brush

It was true that daddy did not often look into the kitchen now
that there was somebody supposedly capable of keeping the room
as well as the rest of the house in order And Janice was glad
he did not look around the house much

Such training as she had enjoyed under her mothers eye had made
Janice thorough Mrs Day had been a thoroughly good
housekeeper

And she had always kept so well up with her housework that there
were never any difficult jobs left to haunt one and her house
looked always neat Nor was she obliged to keep half her
prettily furnished rooms shut up to keep them clean

Janice did all she could on this short Saturday morning She had
first of all to he sure that daddys room was dustedevery bit
Then there were the halls and stairs to do After those the
porches must be swept

For you know sighed Mrs Watkins it looks so much better for
a child like you to be out sweeping the porch and paths than what
it would me

Janice could not quite understand this reasoning But she knew
it must be a deal easier for Mrs Watkins to rock in a chair in
the house than to wield the broom That went without saying

She did not think of lunch although the fadedout lady did not
neglect her own Janice was down on her hands and knees with
scrubbing brush and pail when the housekeeper carried some
savory dish or other into the dining room

I presume since you had your breakfast so late you will not care
to eat now said the woman To tell the truth a tear or two
dropped into the strong soda water in the pail

Though I dont believe salt will help start the greasespots on
this floor Janice thought rubbing her eyes with the wrist of
one hand There I am a regular crybaby I said I would do
something to relieve daddy of bothering about the housework And
if scrubbing a floor is the best I can do

Suddenly a shadow appeared at the door Janice looked up and
squealed There was daddy himselfat least an hour and a half
too early

Well well exclaimed Broxton Day rather sternly what is
the meaning of this

Dirt on the floor boardsscrubbing brushelbow grease
retorted his daughter making vigorous explanatory motions
Didnt you ever see a scrub lady before Daddy

Humph so there is a Cinderella in the house is there he said

Mrs Watkins opened the diningroom door She was swallowing a
mouthful which seemed to go down hard Mr Days unexpected
appearance disturbed her

Oh Mr Day she cried feebly havehave you had your
lunch

I have Mrs Watkins he replied Then to Janice No matter
how much you may like to scrub floors my dear you will have to
leave this one for Mrs Watkins to finish There is a car at the
door I have borrowed it for a couple of hours and you must
make haste and put on something different and come with me to
look for Olga

Well Janice got up from her knees slowly

Hurry said daddy sternly And he stood and waited until
Janice went out of the room

So you will not have lunch Mr Day asked Mrs Watkins coolly

No But there is one thing I will have Mrs Watkins he said
sternly I will have you attend to your work and not put it on
Janice while you remain here

I do not understand you sir said the woman her nose in the
air

Let me make myself plain then said Broxton Day I will not
pay you wages to shift such work as this pointing to the
scrubpail upon my daughter I want that understood here and
now I can no longer give you carte blanche at the grocery and
provision store I will do the marketing myself hereafter You
will furnish the lists

Sir ejaculated Mrs Watkins haughtily

I have kept tabs on the accounts this last week In no seven
days since I was married have the expenses for the table been
half what they have been this week

I am not used to a povertystricken household Mr Day sneered
Mrs Watkins

But you soon will be Broxton Day told her grimly if I let
you have a free hand in this way I am not a rich man and I
soon will be a poor one at this rate

I want you to understand Mr Day that no lady can demean
herself

Wait a moment said the man still grimly I did not hire you
to be a lady I hired you to do the housework I cant have you
here unless you keep your share of the contract Please remember
that Mrs
Watkins

He left her abruptly and walked through to the front of the
house He saw that at her place on the dining table was the
remains of a broiled squabchickena very tasty bit for a hard
working woman like Mrs Watkins

Are you ready daughter he called up the stairway

Just a minute or two Daddy replied Janice

She felt that they were in trouble again All she had tried to
do to keep him from knowing just how badly things about the house
were going had been for naught

But she winked back the tears and practised a smile in her
looking glass before she ran down to join daddy on the porch
There was a big touring car out in front Janice knew it
belonged to the vicepresident of the Farmers ad Merchants Bank

Oh what a fine car Daddy she whispered clinging to his
hand Lets play it is ourswhile we are in it of course

Would you like to have a car my dear he asked her as they
settled themselves in the tonneau and the driver started the
machine

Oh she cried I could just jump out of my skin when I think
of it Every time I ride with Stella

Latham Im just as covetous as I can be I guess I am real
wicked Daddy

I shouldnt be surprised he returned smiling It would be
nice to have all the comforts and the luxuries of the
richwithout their troubles

Mmm said Janice But even their troubles cant be so bad
Not as bad as poor peoples troubles

Like ours he returned smiling down at her

It is a fact that we cannot keep a hired girl Were not as
lucky as the man I heard of who was boasting of having kept a
cook a whole month But it seemed that this month his house was
quarantined for scarlet fever

Oh Daddy giggled Janice Lets get a yellow or a red card
from the Board of Health and tack it up outside the door

And so keep Mrs Watkins whether or no I am not sure that we
can stand her my dear

Weell there are worse Janice confessed And we have had
them commented her father rather grimly Ah thats the little
house where the Johnsons live

Oh dear me If it should be our Olga

Well know about that pretty soon said Mr Day comfortingly
Stop here Harry

The car was halted and Mr Day jumped out and went up to the
house When he knocked a tall pale woman with a little baby in
her arms opened the narrow door It took but a glance to reveal
her nationality

You bane want my hoosban asked the Swedish woman

No Mrs Johnson replied Mr Day I came to inquire about a
young woman that I believe is staying here

No vooman here but me declared the other shaking her head
vigorously

What Havent you a friend here named Olga

Olga bane gone declared the woman sullenly

Gone away exclaimed Mr Day Since last evening

She bane gone

Are you Mrs Johnson asked the man earnestly

My name bane Yonsonyes she agreed I dont know nottin
bout Olga She bane gone She did not mane to break dish
anyway

Oh exclaimed Mr Day remembering what Janice had told him
about the accident at the Lathams the evening before We have
not come about the dish It is for another matter entirely that
we wish to find Olga

I not know where Olga bane go pursued Mrs Johnson shaking
her head vigorously

She went away this morning then

Yah She bane go dis mornin

Is her name Olga Cedarstrom

No No exclaimed Mrs Johnson shaking her head vigorously
You not bknow dis Olga She nudder girl

Where is your husband asked Mr Day hopelessly Perhaps he
can tell me more about her

Yon Yonson gone to Dover declared his wife suddenly shutting
the door and leaving Mr Broxton Day outside on the step



CHAPTER XVI A LETTER FROM POKETOWN

It looks as though we had come upon a fools errand said Mr
Day coming back to the car and his daughter Mrs Johnson says
that girl was not named Cedarstrom and that she has already gone
away

Do you suppose it is the truth Daddy asked the anxious
Janice

Well it is probably the truth All Olgas are not named
Cedarstrom of course And I fancy the girl was frightened
because of the broken cutglass dish and escaped early this
morning

Why Would Mrs Latham try to make her pay for it

Perhaps At least this mysterious Olga thought she would be
made to pay for the dish Or perhaps she feared arrest
Sometimes these foreigners are very ignorant regarding our laws
She might easily have been frightened away

But if she is our Olga

This woman here is stubborn She will probably tell us nothing
more about her friend And she said flatly that the name was not
Cedarstrom

Oh dear sighed Janice it is too too bad

It is too bad that the trail seems lost I will try to see Mr
Johnson himself We will make sure that the girl was not the one
we are after But you see we are inquiring for Olga for a
reason that is likely to frighten her and her friends I think
some of those people over in Pickletown might tell me more than
they do about Olga and that Willie Sangreen

It is just too bad half sobbed Janice I hoped we should
find the treasurebox this time

Have patience Rome was not built in a day said her father

Were not building Rome the girl retorted but trying to smile
again I guess even that was an easier job than finding a lost
Swedish girl Dont
 worry honey

But I cant help worrying said Janice sobbing again

You are overwrought my dear Dont let your mind run upon
unpleasant things That treasurebox

Will never be found Daddy cried his little daughter I am
sure And if it isnt found I dont dontknowwhat
Ishalldo

He put his arm about her and hugged Janice tight against his
side Dont lose hope so easily And see here Here is
something new I forgot to tell you

What is it Daddy she asked as he began to search an inner
pocket of his coat

A letter From your Aunt Almira Just listen to it

Oh Daddy From Aunt Almira inin Poketown

Yes My halfbrothers wifeand a good soul she
 is

He drew the letter from its envelope and unfolded it He began to
read the epistle with a smile wreathing his lips for Aunt
Almiras communication was unintentionally funny

Dear Brocky

Jase wont never get around to writing you far as I see so I
had better do so before you get the suspicion that we are all
dead We might as well be and buried too here in Poketownfor
it is right next door to a cemetery for deadness I do believe
You know what it was when you was lucky enough to get out of it
twenty years ago Well it is worse now There has been nothing
new in Poketown since you went away excepting the town pumps
been painted once

That time you came to see us with Laura when Janice was a
little girl

Why Daddy interrupted Janice her eyes round with wonder I
dont remember Poketown at all

You were too little to recall that visit I have only been back
there once since you and your dear mother and I visited Jase and
Almira Then he went on reading aloud

You remember the house needed painting and the front gate hung
by one hinge Well it still needs painting and that one hinge
has give up the ghost now So you see there hasnt been many
changes Youre the only Day I guess that ever had any get up
and get to them

But my heart has been full of thoughts of you since we heard of
poor Lauras death We often speak of you and wonder how you and
that little girl get on all stark alone I know how I should
feel if Jase and Marty was left as you and Janice be

Oh gasped Janice shed be dead

Well mused her father Almira living in such a dead place as
Poketown evidently considers that she knows about how she would
feel in her grave

Is it such an awful place Daddy Janice asked seriously

What do you mean he inquired in surprise Oh Poketown I
mean of course
It is a lovely place But it must be confessed that it is a
good deal behind the times It is not as bad as Aunt Mira makes
it out to be I guess Only the old Day house has pretty well
gone to rack and ruin

Well Lets hear the rest urged Janice

Jase says to be mighty careful if you should have to go down to
that Mexico place He reads in his Ledger that sometimes there
is shooting down there and that the Mexicaners dont care who
they shoot

Oh Daddy cried Janice you dont mean you are going to
Mexico

I wrote them when I thought it might be necessary he
confessed

And you would send me East if you went Oh Daddy please

Well my dear that seemed the wisest thing to do

Oh Daddy

Dont worry now We have engaged a new superintendent at the
mines and I guess things will go on all right Listen to what
your Aunt Mira says

Of course if you have to go down there on business you send
Janice right to us Im speaking for Jase as well as myself We
aint rich of course but theres enough to fill another mouth
yet awhile so dont be bashful

Hoping this finds you and Janice in health it leaving us all
the same I will close

Your sisterinlaw and Janices aunt ALMIRA DAY

I hope you wont have to go and that I wont have to go
Daddy exclaimed the girl anxiously

Shes a good soulAlmira Shed do her best by you

I dont want anybody to do their best by meonly you Daddy

But you see my dear I couldnt leave you alone at home here
Certainly not with a woman like Mrs Watkins

Weell

Why she would be imposing upon you all the time No indeed
I feel that she is not the woman for our house after all

Oh dear Daddy isnt it funny how many people there are in the
world who dont just fit

Right you are my dear he agreed laughing again Round pegs
in square holes The woods are full of them

That Mrs Watkins never should have gone out to work

I guess not

And people like Mrs Carringford have got their own families and
their own troubles So we cant get them

What put Amys mother in your mind

I wish you could see their house Daddy

I have he said rather grimly And it is sight

Not inside Oh not at all Daddy she cried It is as neat
as wax Mrs Carringford is just a love of a housekeeper I
wish you could see how neat everything is kept and she sighed

The automobile soon brought them to the house at Eight Hundred
and Fortyfive Knight Street Mr Day had become serious again
as they came in sight of the cottage in which so much of a
disturbing nature had happened of late

For a few days it was true Broxton Day had hoped the new
housekeeper would prove an efficient and trustworthy employee
but what he had seen on coming unexpectedly home this Saturday
noon had caused doubt to rise in his mind

Experience had taught him that domestic servants are the most
independent of laborers To dare call one to accountespecially
one like Mrs Watkinswas to court disaster

He had felt this to be the case at the time yet he was unwilling
to see Janice made a drudge of by the too ladylike Mrs Watkins
If the kitchen floor had to be scrubbed and the houseworker
would not scrub it he would do it himself

In this mood he entered his home All was quiet There was
nobody in the living room or dining room On the table in the
latter room were the dirty dishes and the remains of Mrs
Watkins lunch

Oh where is she gasped Janice following her father through
the rooms

Mr Day led the way to the kitchen The pail stood where Janice
had left it the scrubbing brush beside it The fire in the
range had gone out

With a smothered cry Janice darted upstairs In a moment her
voice reached his expectant ear

Oh Daddy shes gone she cried



CHAPTER XVII MISS PECKHAM WASHES HER HANDS

It seemed that Mrs Sophronia Watkins had never sent for her
trunk so all she had to do was to pack her bag and walk out of
the house And she had done that very thing

What cant be cured must be endured quoted Daddy Here is
a nice little island of clean floor where you scrubbed Janice
I will build the fire heat water and finish the job

Oh no Daddy Let me Your poor knees My knees are not
poor Id have you know he retorted laughing You dust
around and make the house presentable for Sunday Thus endeth
the lesson No more lady housekeepers Janice for us

Noo I spose not But who shall we get

That is on the knees of the gods my child answered Daddy who
often used quotations that Janice did not altogether understand
but which she thought were very fine just the same
I guess you mean that nobody knows unless hes omniscient she
said now Thats a big word Daddy but we had it in our lesson
the other day And I guess only somebody who knows everything
could guess who will work for us next Oh dear

These three weeks have been an expensive experience said her
father ruefully enough Besides the addition to our household
bills Mrs Watkins asked me the other evening for her months
wages Salary she called it She was about ten days ahead of
time but I gave it to her

So we can figure that our months expenses have been about
doubled We could not stand that for long Janice Perhaps it
is a blessing that Mrs Watkins has taken herself off

Just the same Daddy Im sorry you came home and caught me
scrubbing the floor Janice sighed We were getting along
without your being botheredafter a fashion

At your cost he said grimly No well hobble along
somehow

But its such a hobble Daddy It seems to me that Im not much
of a do something girl or Id manage better than I do And
Janice sighed

You do wonders daughter for a girl of your age Maybe it is
daddy who fails

Oh Daddy never

Janice hurried to do the things Mrs Watkins had left undone
And so she forgot some little purchases that had to be made
until it was almost dark

Remembering these she put on her hat and jacket in haste and
telling her father where she was going ran out to the street
There were the Weeks tribe Junior in the lead with most of
the other children of the neighborhood running through Love
Street in a noisy and excited throng

What can be the matter now A fire wondered Janice

Her errand took her in an opposite direction But she saw people
standing at their gates and chatting to each other as though
there was some neighborhood interest that she did not know about

What is the matter with everybody Janice asked one girl whom
she met

Why didnt you see it was the surprised answer

Maybe I did only I didnt know what it was laughed Janice

A dancing bear A great big brown fellow You never saw the
like said her acquaintance

Well thought Janice we cannot hire a dancing bear to do our
housework that is sure So I dont believe he interests me

She did the errand and hastened home for daddy and she had not
yet had supper She ran in at the side door and as she did so
she heard voices in the kitchen She halted listening for one
of the voices she recognized as Miss Peckhams and it was
highpitched and angry

I wash my hands of you bothI can tell you that exclaimed the
spinster from next door I dont know why I should have put
myself out to help you Broxton Day in any case

I do not see why you should Daddy replied rapidly Yet I
believe you meant well and I thank you

Meant well sniffed the visitor I dont know what thats
got to do with it I gave you bothboth Sophrony and youthe
chance of your lives And neither of you appreciate it I wash
my hands of you

Janice pushed open the door quietly and stepped in closing it
after her Miss Peckham with flashing black eyes and more color
in her face than usual had drawn herself up commandingly in the
middle of the kitchen floor and was staring at Mr Day angrily

Theres that gal exclaimed the spinster Shes the one to
blame

I assure you to the contrary Janice was doing her best to hide
Mrs Watkins shortcomings from me said Mr Day smiling warmly
at his daughter

It dont matter Twas over her you and Sophrony quarreled
You admit it

I certainly do not admit that I quarreled with Mrs Watkins he
said firmly She evidently took offense

at what I said to her and she left Now she cannot come back
Under no circumstances would I consider it

Well I wash my hands of you both exclaimed Miss Peckham
again and she turned sharply toward the back doorthe door
opposite the one by which Janice had just entered

The matter of washing her hands seemed important if only a
figure of speech She repeated it angrily as she jerked open the
kitchen door And then she uttered a strange squeaking cry that
startled Janice and her father before they caught sight of what
had caused the womans fright

Miss Peckham seemed transfixed with terror She threw up her
hands stiffly and toppled over backward She fell just as though
she had not a joint in her body and she fell so hard that her
feet sprang up into the air when her shoulders and the back of
her head struck the floor

Standing upright framed by the doorframe was a huge shaggy
ragged looking bear and he was snuffling and whining as bears do
when they want something Really the bear was begging but none
of those in the kitchen for a moment realized that fact

Mr Day grabbed the poker Janice squealed and hid behind him
But her single affrighted cry was all the sound Miss Peckham
made She really had collapsed in what Janice thought was a
faint

Before Mr Day could attack the creature a whining voice from
the darkness behind the bear said

Breadbutter please SignoreSignora Pietro no bite He
gooda bear Give supper please Pietro lika breadbutter

The bear came down upon his forepaws still whining They could
see then the chain by which a very dark man with little gold
rings in his ears held the animal in leash The trainer smiled
very broadly while Pietro snuffed curiously at the soles of Miss
Peckhams shoes

And Miss Peckham kicked the harmless Pietro on the nose



CHAPTER XVIII ALL IN THE DAYS WORK

The huge brown bear whined again and seemed grieved that his
innocent attentions should be so ungratefully received The
hysterical Miss Peckham kicked again and Pietro backed away and
left space for his suavely smiling master in the doorway of the
Days kitchen

II wash my hands of you moaned the prostrate spinster

WhatHow did you come to bring that bear into my yard
demanded Mr Day finally recovering his voice

Boy tella me you give Pietro supper said the man with the very
engaging smile Breadbutter Pietro lika heem

That Arlo Weeks Junior cried Janice suddenly Oh Daddy
there he is outside

There was a loud explosion of laughter back of the bear and his
trainer on the dark porch and then the clatter of running feet
Juniors proclivity for practical jokes was too well known for
the Days to doubt his connivance in this most surprising
happening

No maka troub Signore whined the Italian master of the bear
in about the same tone Bruin himself had begged

Mr Day was helping the overwrought Miss Peckham to her feet

Of all things he muttered Take her out the other way
Janicedo

I wash my hands of you repeated the spinster scarcely aware
yet of what had happened Then she suddenly descried the bear
again She shrieked in a most earpiercing tone

There it is I know Janice Day did that Dont talk

to me Shes the plague of the neighborhood No wonder Sophrony
couldnt stand it here Bringing bears into the house

Oh Oh Miss Peckham I never cried Janice

Dont deny it Youyou horrid child declared the spinster
and repeating again that she washed her hands of them all she
ran out of the house by the other door and quickly disappeared in
the direction of her own cottage

Well I never exclaimed Mr Day falling into a chair Then
he burst into uproarious laughter

The Italian who had been about to withdraw and was tugging on
the bears chain began to smile again He foresaw leniency when
the master of the house could laugh like this

Janice gave way to merriment too It was funny Much as she
was sorry for Miss Peckhams fright the situation altogether was
one to amuse her

Pietro waddled into the kitchen and sat up like a dog to beg A
bear is a foolish looking beast at best unless it becomes
illtempered and this big brown thing so his smiling master
said had the heart of a child

And the stomach of an ostrich declared Janice after almost
every cold scrap in the house had followed several slices of
breadbutter down Pietros cavernous maw

The old fellow was as goodnatured as he could be After the
feast he went through his little repertoire of tricks with little
urging

He played soldier and went through his own particular manual of
arms with his masters stick as a gun He played dead but
with his little piglike eyes twinkling all the time

Finally he danced with his master and with such abandon if not
grace that the dishes rattled on the shelves in the kitchen
cupboard

There that will do Hes paid for his supper Next thing
hell have the house down about our ears declared Mr Broxton
Day

Grazias Signore grazias Signora said the bear trainer over
and over again and bowing deeply as he jerked Pietro by the
chain toward the door

His eyes his teeth and the little gold rings in his ears all
twinkled together Janice thought he was a very polite man

And I hope he is always kind to Pietro she said when the
foreigner and his strange pet were gone But Daddy Dont we
have the greatest happenings in our house

Right you are my dear An aristocratic lady has left us flat
the neighborhood censor has washed her hands of us and we have
entertained a highly educated bear all in a single day As you
might say all these astonishing happenings are all in the Days
work The Days certainly do entertain the most astonishing
adventures

Oh my Dont we giggled his daughter

And now if Pietro the bear has left us anything in the house to
eat let us have supper Janice I expect that hereafter Miss
Peckhams opinion of us will be too acrimonious for speech

Oh she never did like me much sighed Janice And now Arlo
Junior has made it worse again Just think The bear on top of
the cats

Scarcely that my dear laughed her father But if she really
believes you introduced that bear for the praise of scaring her
her poor Sams getting hurt over here will be a small incident
compared with this ursine holdup The neighbors are going to
hear about this I feel sure

Nor was he mistaken on that point Before fortyeight

hours had elapsed it was noised around the neighborhood that
that very ladylike person Mrs Watkins had been obliged to
leave the Days and had returned to Marietteville because of the
treatment accorded her in that house which she had entered only
as a favor

It was told that Janice had invited a tramp with a dancing bear
into the house and that no lady who deemed herself such could
endure rudeness of that character Somehow the neighborhood
censor did not figure in the story of the dancing bear perhaps
she feared to be ridiculed

But Janice told Mrs Carringford all about it That good woman
had serious troubles of her own but she was not so selfish that
she could not sympathize with Janice

I do wish I could do something to help you and your father my
dear said the woman When people have as nice a house as you
have Amy has told me all about
it
it does seem too bad that it cant be kept as a home should be
kept

Like yours Mrs Carringford said Janice

My dear sighed Mrs Carringford I dont know how long well
have our home poor as it is We owe a lot of money on it I am
afraid I did wrong in trying to buy this place and she shook
her head sadly

Janice did not feel like asking the friendly woman pointblank
what she meant but Amy afterward explained

You see Janice Mr Abel Strout of Napsburg owned this house
It was he who advised mother strongly to

buy a home with fathers insurance money We didnt know how
much it cost to keep up a house after you get possession of it

Mr Strout took part of our money in payment and mother gave a
mortgage to him for the balance of the price And that mortgage
is troubling mother greatly

I guess mortgages are bad things Janice observed with a wise
nod of her head

They are when poor folks have em anyway You see mother held
back some money to live on But taxes and repairs and
assessments have to come out of that as well as the interest on
the mortgage that comes due halfyearly And that isnt all

No asked Janice interested

Now it seems that Mr Strout only wrote that mortgage

for a year and he can do what he calls call it in a month from
now Of course mother cant pay the mortgage it is hard enough
to pay the interest on it And so Mr Strout says he will just
take the house back and wewell lose our money and all
finished Amy with almost a sob

Why I think that is too mean for anything cried her friend
Cant he be stopped

I dont know how And I guess mother doesnt He says he would
accept a payment on the principalthats
the mortgage you know But mother doesnt dare give up any more
of our money There is nobody earning any but Gummy And how
far do you suppose his three dollars a week goes in buying food
for all us children for instance

Janice had no answer for this but she determined to tell daddy
the particulars of Mrs Carringfords trouble Besides she had
in her mind and had had for a long time a desire to bring her
father and Amys mother together She wanted them to know each
other and for a very definite reason



CHAPTER XIX A FLAREUP

 At school the first of that week there was little talked about
of course save the glories of Stellas party No girl in the
grammar grade had ever celebrated her birthday with such
magnificence The commendation she heard on all sides made
Stella very proud

Because so many of the girls tried to show her their appreciation
of the nice time they had had at the Latham farm Stella began to
feel quite puffed up She considered herself to be the most
important person in her grade at least if not in the whole
school

It was a privilege to be taken up by the Latham car after school
and set down at ones door and Stella distributed such favors
with no lack of shrewdness She meant such rides to bring her
popularity Janice had often been the recipient of these
kindnesses and as she had told her father it did delight her to
ride in an automobile

But since she had become so friendly with Amy Carringford Janice
had frequently walked home with her or Amy had accompanied her
to the Day house after school

Stella was shallow enough when it came to displaying her own
friendship for another girl but suddenly it struck the farmers
daughter that a girl who had once been much in her company was
showing a preference for somebody else

That Janice Day is sly she muttered to herself passing Janice
and Amy as they wended their chattering way homeward She
thinks I dont notice what shes doing Ill give it to her
tomorrow see if I dont

This threat she proceeded to put into practice And it came most
unexpectedly both to Janice and Amy

Janice of course was perfectly innocent and quite unsuspicious
of any attack and Amy did not dream that Stella did not like
her Had not the farmers daughter invited Amy to her party In
fact Amy was liked by almost everybody teachers and pupils
included

In arithmetic Stella always was dull and on this particular
morning she was more than ordinarily careless in recitation
Miss Marble gave her a sharp word and propounded the same
question to Amy Carringford The latter returned the correct
answer and then gave the redfaced Stella a deprecatory smile

Dont you grin at me you pauper hissed Stella and so loudly
that several of the girls near by heard her words

Even Miss Marble took notice of Stellas speech although she
could not overhear what she said

No communicating during recitations Stella she said sharply

Amy had paled to her very lips and the tears sprang to her eyes
Janice was too far away to understand but she was
interestedshe could not fail to be

None who heard the unkind remark of Stella Latham but felt sorry
that one of their mates should be so rude and ungracious

Of course we all know Amy Carringford is poorjust as poor as
poverty one of them said at recess But that is no reason for
telling her so

This girl was quite energetic in saying thisand moreto the
offending Stella

Just because you ride in an automobile and your father owns a
farm you need not think that you are better than anybody else in
our classfor youre not Stella Latham Amy Carringford is
every whit as good as you are

Is that so snapped Stella Shes a poverty stricken thing
She hasnt got a decent thing to wear

What nonsense Stella drawled another and older girl
shrugging her shoulders I noticed particularly the other
night Amy had as pretty a frock on as anybody at your party

Yes And where did she get it flared out Stella

Her mother made it I fancy said the same girl laughing

That dress was given her by Janice Day Amy couldnt have come
to my party otherwiseso now You just ask Janice if what I say
isnt so cried Stella stamping her foot

I dont believe it said the first speaker shortly

So Im a storyteller am I almost shrieked Stella You just
ask Janice

Just then Janice strolled into the room where the girls were
gathered at this lunch hour Amy of course had run home for
her lunchand run home in tears Janice knew The latter knew
that Stella was the cause of Amys trouble but up to this point
she had not discovered the exact reason for the flareup

You think I dont tell the truth pursued Stella in a loud and
angry voice I suppose youll believe what Janice Day says
You just ask her who gave that nasty Amy Carringford the dress
she wore to my party

Janice stopped stock still for a moment Her schoolmates
statement was like a blow in the face Mean of disposition as she
knew Stella Latham to be she had not thought the girl would tell
the secret of Amys pretty dress

After the ban of silence Janice had put upon the farmers
daughter and the latters promise to obey that mandate and tell
nobody about the pink and white frock this deliberate breaking
of Stellas word astounded Janice Day Her face flushed then
paled and she looked as though she were the person guilty of the
outrage rather than Stella

What nonsense exclaimed the older girl but looking at Janice
curiously Why put it on Janice Stella You are saying
something you do not know anything about

Oh I dont exclaimed the farmers daughter You just ask
Janice I tell you

Do your own asking said another Janice doesnt look very
pleasant and she laughed

You tell em commanded Stella starting toward Janice
threateningly Didnt you give Amy that dress so she could come
to my party Didnt you

Janice had begun to recover her confidenceand her good sense
too She could not deny the accusation but she determined to
put Stella before her fellow schoolmates in just the right light

I do not know that it is a crime for one girl to help another
Janice said quietly and still very pale If I did what Stella
claims I did it was nothing shameful I am sureeither for Amy
or for me

Of course it wasnt murmured one of the other girls

Bully for you Janice said another in commendation

It really was only our businessAmys and mine But Stella knew
about it In fact Stella came to me about Amy in the first
place She wanted to invite Amy and she fearedso she
saidthat Amy would not have a
party dress I undertook to find her one and hard
enough time I had getting Amy and her mother to agree
to use the dress

But that said Janice scornfully is a purely personal matter
between them and me I want to ask you girls though what you
think of a person who after having given her word to keep the
matter a secret deliberately taunts Amy with the fact that she
took the dress from me That is what I want to know

The other girls were silent for the moment Janice Days
scornful question was too pointed to be ignored Stella broke out
again in anger her voice high and shrill

I dont care So there She is a dowdy little thing and she
had no business to come to my party anyway

Stella said the older girl grimly youre making yourself
awfully ridiculous And worse You cant keep a secret And
you dont keep your word I guess there will be more than Amy
Carringford who will be sorry that they ever went to your old
party Now stop yelling Here comes Miss Marble

The flareup was only the beginning of a very unhappy time at
school for Amy Carringford Nor could Janice escape being
unhappy too with her new friend

That Stella was unable to raise any cabal against Janice and Amy
but quite the contrary made the situation only a degree more
bearable for the two friends Although the other girls did not
join Stella Latham in mourning the poor girl who lived in Mullen
Lane the latter felt deeply the fact that she was considered
different from her schoolmates

Oh I wish mother would let me go to work Amy sighed on more
than one occasion and to Janices sympathetic ear I declare
Id go out as a servant in somebodys home if mother would let
me We need the money so

Goodness Dont say such things pleaded Janice We need a
servant right now bad enough But you would not want to come
and scrub and sweep and wash and iron even for daddy and meyou
know you wouldnt

I dont care Mother says she must go to work somewhere Ill
then have to come to school on part time only Somebody must
look after the twins and Edna May

Oh Amy what will your mother do

She doesnt know She has tried to get work to do at home But
all the sewing machine work she can obtain is so heavy And so
poorly paid What do you suppose she gets for stitching those
great heavy motormans coatsputting them all together except
making buttonholes and sewing on buttons which is done in the
factory

I have no idea said Janice

Thirtysevencents exclaimed Amy tragically Think of it
And they almost kill her they are so heavy to handle

Oh my dear I wouldnt let her do them

I guess we wouldntGummy and Iif we could help it sobbed
Amy But something must be done by the Carringford family to
help out When Mr Strout comes over from Napsburg next week he
will make us pay off something on that mortgage or turn us out
of the house such as it is

Dear Amy I wish I could do something for you sighed Janice

She said nothing more than that at the time But that very
evening she did not at once open her schoolbooks when she and her
father sat down finally in the living room the supper dishes
washed and put away and the kitchen swept

They had remained without any help since the departure of Mrs
Sophronia Watkins Mr Day had gone every day to the
intelligence offices and brought back the most discouraging
reports

But Daddy isnt there any person in the whole of Greensboro or
in the county any more who has to work for her living asked
Janice

That man Murphy at whose office I engaged Delia says that
there are no good houseworkers any more He says the girls who
come to him for situations are all specialists said daddy
gloomily enough

Special dunces I guess Janice rejoined rather tartly if
Delia was a sample

But she wasnt said daddy with a smile At any rate he
tells me he has good cooks and good chambermaids and good
laundresses but he has no combinations of those trades

Oh

Girls do not like to go out to service in families where
general housework is expected It seems he added grimly
that to get good help we should engage two or three girls and
then have a lady like Mrs Watkins to superintend

I guess well have to give up and go to boarding then sighed
Janice Only I am sure I should just detest a boarding house
Daddy

I am afraid we should both dislike such a life as that Your
dear mother gave us too good and comfortable a home

But we ought to be used to the discomforts of housekeeping by
this time said Janice But oh Daddy There are other folks
who have worse times than we do

So I believe he agreed nodding as he unfolded his paper

Wait Daddy she begged I want to tell you

About other peoples troubles he asked with a quizzical
smile

Yes I do Its about the Carringfords

Ahha You were saying once that they were in trouble over their
home were you not I looked that place up A fellow named
Strout

And hes so mean declared Janice with vigor

Yes That seems to be his middle name agreed her father
quietly I am afraid Mrs Carringford got into the hands of a
sharper when she undertook to buy that cottage in Mullen Lane of
Abel Strout

Oh dear Daddy isnt there any way of helping them out of
their trouble Janice asked disappointedly

I cannot tell that until I know all the particulars

Oh Let me tell you

Do you know them my dear he asked interrupting her

Well I know some of them she confessed with less vehemence

I think you had better ask Mrs Carringford to come to see me
If she will tell me about it I may be able to advise her at
least I know Strout is a sharper

Oh my dear That is so good of you Janice cried Ill tell
her

She can bring her papers here instead of to the bank added
Mr Day on second thought Perhaps she will like that better
Any evening that she chooses my dear

Janice could scarcely wait until the next day to tell her friend
Amy what her father had said



CHAPTER XX STELLA KEEPS ONE SECRET

It was on this evening too that Daddy told Janice he had made a
point of seeing and talking with Johnson Mr Lathams tenant
The man had a small account in the Farmers and Merchants Bank
for like most of his nation Yon Yonson as his wife had
called him was a frugal man

He came into the bank and I inquired about the girl who visited
his wife and who broke Mrs Lathams cutglass dish said Mr
Day Johnson says he knows little about the girlnot even
where she lives or really who she is Only he told me her last
name was not Cedarstrom

So that I fear added Mr Day shaking his head is another
lost trail It does seem that the mystery of the disappearance
of our treasurebox Janice is likely to remain a mystery

At least that girl at the Lathams was another girl than our
Olga Johnson says she was only visiting his wife for a day or
two She was a friend of has wifes I think they believe Latham
wants to find the girl to make her pay for that broken dish so
they are less willing to talk about her than might otherwise be
the case

Just the same sighed Janice I do wish Gummy had known just
how our Olga looked

How is that

Then he would have known for sure whether it was Olga Cedarstrom
or not Just his seeing that her hair was strained back from her
face doesnt prove anything

I should say it did not laughed her father That manner of
wearing the hair seems to be a common failing with these Swedish
women Besides didnt I tell you that Johnson says that girl is
not named Cedarstrom

Weell it is awfully funny Daddy It doesnt seem as though a
girl could disappear so completelywiped right off the map

Vigorously expressed I admit her father interrupted But we
must not begin to doubt everybodys word about it I guess
Johnson is honest

And those other people who knew her in Pickletown

They simply dont know what has become of her Or of Willie
Sangreen either Daddy admitted That does seem strange Of
course the two have gone off somewhere to be married and have not
told their friends

It proves that Olga did take dear mothers miniature andand
those letters said Janice excitedly Or she would not hide
herself

Yes I thought we had already agreed on that her father said

It was evident that he did not wish uselessly to discuss the
matter of the lost keepsakes Janice young as she was realized
that her father was growing more grave and more serious every
day She did not believe that this change was altogether due to
business anxieties or even to their household vexations

At night after she was supposed to be in bed and sound asleep
the girl heard him walking back and forth the length of the
living room or sometimes now that the weather was so mild he
tramped up and down the front porch until very very late

There was surely some trouble on his mind that he did not care to
confide to his little daughter Broxton Day sighed more often
than had been his wont even during those hard hard days
immediately following the death of Janices mother His hearty
laugh was not so spontaneous nor heard as often as before

Janice could not speak about this change in her father She
believed she knew why he was so grave and why some of his nights
were sleepless

Broxton Day had loved his wife with a passionate devotion He
must miss her presence more and more as the days went on In
spite of all the companionship Janice could give him the mans
existence was a lonely one

And too her heart told her that she had been the unwitting
cause of this new burden which had come upon daddys mind Those
letters which Janice had never seenthe presence of which she
had not even suspected in the secret compartment of the lost
treasureboxhad been Broxton Days most precious possession
Janice had lost them Her carelessness had given the angry Olga
the opportunity to take the box away with her

The letters had been written at a time when Janices father and
mother were very close together in spirit if not in actual
contact Even Janice could understand that Laura Day must have
revealed her very soul to her husband in those epistles

Oh if she could only bring them back

So sorrow began to be entertained in the Day house on Knight
Street as a continual guest It did seem too that Janice
could do very little to relieve her father of any of the
embarrassments of their situation She

worked as hard as she could before she went to school and after
she came home but she could not begin to do all that was needed
to be done And she was so tired sometimes after supper that she
fell asleep over her homework

Their meals became too a mere round of baconandegg breakfasts
and delicatessen suppers Shopcooked meats and potato salads
were on the bill of fare too often to tempt the appetite of
either Mr Day or his daughter and the latter began to depend a
good deal upon bakers stuff for her lunch

With the unfortunate experiences they had had with help however
Janice did not wonder that daddy found nobody to suit him at the
agencies Olga Delia Mrs Watkinsand all those who had come
and gone before were enough to fill the mind of any person with
despair

Janice did not forget to tell Mrs Carringford what Mr Day had
said regarding her trouble and that on the very next day

Hell be sure to see some way out for you Mrs Carringford
the girl assured her friends mother with much confidence
Daddy is always doing things for folks He doesnt just advise
he is sure to do something

Yes I should not be surprised if Mr Broxton Day was a
dosomething man said Mrs Carringford smiling He must be
when he has such a dosomething daughter

And you really will come up to see him this evening urged
Janice blushing rosily at what she considered a compliment

IIwell my dear I could not accept any financial
favor from your father I would not have a right to do
so The Carringfords must be independent

But Mrs Carringford you mustnt feel that way I have no idea
Daddy could give you much money even if you would let him
But you see he knows so much more about such things as
mortgages and loans and real estate that he can give you good
advice And he says that Mr Abel Strouts middle name is
Mean

Mrs Carringford laughingly agreed to that and in the evening
she came to the house with Gummy Amy being left at home to take
care of the little ones

Mr Day had already met and quite approved of Mrs Carringfords
two older children Gummy and Amy for he had seen them both at
the house But he had had no idea in spite of Janices
enthusiastic praise that Mrs Carringford was quite the woman
she was

He saw now a very gentle pretty woman whose soft wavy hair was
becoming prematurely gray with an intelligent countenance and
eyes that fixed ones attention almost immediately Here Mr
Day saw was a capable energetic spirita woman who would carry
through whatever she undertook could it be carried through at
all yet who was not objectionably selfassertivelike
Miss Peckham for instance

If Mrs Carringford had made a mistake in her purchase of the
property in Mullen Lane it was because she had been badly
advised if not actually cheated by the sly old fellow who had
for years owned the property which he had taken for a bad debt

Abel Strout had doubtless been glad to get rid of the Mullen Lane
place and for the first payment made upon it by Mrs
Carringford But he had been foxy enough to make a hard and fast
bargain with the widow He had her tied up in a contract that
if she failed to meet her obligations in a small way even would
enable him to walk in and take the place away from her

And he had done more than that For some reason best known to
himself he had first transferred the property to one John
Jamisona farm hand of that section and had then had this
Jamison transfer the property to Mrs Carringford he paying the
difference represented by the mortgage he held

He said Jamison had grown tired of his bargain a week after he
bought it Mrs Carringford explained He wanted Mr Strout to
take it back Strout said by making the transfer he would be
aiding both Mr Jamison and me

And now a change was coming Since the transfer Mullen Lane
property had begun to look up A factory was going to be built
in the vicinity and that part of Greensboro was likely to offer
a better field for real estate operations

Broxton Day knew all this which Mrs Carringford did not He
saw that what Strout wanted was to get the property back into his
own hands again He would refuse to renew the mortgage and
frighten Mrs Carringford into giving up her home

The way the matter figured out the expense of paying interest
and taxes on the Mullen Lane property was no greater than rental
would be elsewhere for the Carringford family In the end if
the widow held on the place might really be more valuable than
it now was and would sell for considerably more than she had
agreed to pay Abel Strout for it

I tell you what you do Broxton Day finally said having
thought the matter over Strout has told you he will accept a
small payment on the mortgage and will then renew the balance
for another year

Yes But ought I to spend any more of the little sum I have
left in that way when my children may need it for food asked
the anxious widow

You show me by these papers that you are fixed fairly well for
another year You and your son will both earn something of
course during the next twelve months So if I were you I would
throw a sprat to catch a herring and he smiled

You mean the widow asked doubtfully

I mean for you to offer him fifty dollars against the principal
of the mortgage No matter of whom you would get money you
would have to pay the same interest you pay Strout now and no
matter whom I might get money from for you so that you could pay
off Strout and get rid of him there would be the additional
expense of making the new mortgage and all that

But is he to be trusted

Not at all At the end of the year he will want more money if
he thinks you will have difficulty in getting it and there is a
chance of your having to give up your home

Oh

But a year from now I prophesy said Mr Day that your little
house will be worth much more than it is today At least it
will be worth no less It will be easier a year from now to
raise another mortgage than it is right now Just toll Strout
along a little and he laughed

Do you think I can do this Mr Day asked Mrs Carringford
doubtfully

You can to it for your childrens sake I have no doubt And
remember in any case if Strout demands the entire mortgage paid
at once within three days I will try to obtain for you a new
mortgagee You shall not lose your home or what money you have
already put into it if I can help it

Oh Mr Day exclaimed the woman warmly If I can go home
with this confident feeling

You may Of course you are in debt It is going to be a hard
struggle for you to get along But your children are growing up
and in time will be able to shoulder a part of the burden which
you have assumed for their sake Take courage Mrs Carringford
Everything will turn out right in the end I am sure

It was plain that Mrs Carringford was greatly comforted When
she left Janice whispered to her father Im awfully proud of
you Daddy You do have such a way with you

But helping other people out of their troubles was not helping
the Days out of their particular Slough of Despond So many
difficulties seemed reaching out to clutch at Janice and Daddy
The girl thought it was like walking through a briarpatch
Every step they took trouble retarded them

First and foremost the disappearance of that strange Olga
Cedarstrom and the loss of the box of heirlooms was continually
in Janices mind The girls at school knew about it although
only Amy knew just how serious the loss was to the Days

The puzzle regarding the girl named Olga who had helped in the
Lathams kitchen the night of Stellas birthday party had been
noised abroad among Janices school friends and more or less
comment was made upon it

Say Janice did you ever find out what became of that Swede who
broke Mrs Lathams dish the night we were all there asked one
of the girls one day Didnt you say she might be the very girl
who ran away from your house

Yes I did think so But it was not the same Her friends
said this girl was not named Cedarstrom

Well whod want such a name anyway laughed another of the
party

Stella was herself one of those present but at this time she was
not speaking to Janice She laughed maliciously when Janice Day
had gone

Whats the matter with you Stella asked Bertha Warring
Your ha ha is like that of the villain in the melodrama
What is the matter

Oh never mind returned Stella apparently very much enjoying
her own secret thoughts

Tell us Stella then well all laugh urged another

Oh no You girls say I cant keep a secret But Ill

show youand that Janice Daythat I can I know something
about the Olgagirl that shed like to know but Janice shall
never learn it from me and Stella laughed again maliciously



CHAPTER XXI THE CLOSING OF SCHOOL

Janice heard from Gummy and Amy just how Abel Strout acted and
what he said when he came to see their mother about the renewal
of the mortgage and the payment of the half years interest
Gummy was very much excited over it

You strought to see that Stout man anyway

Oh dear me Gummy there you go again gasped Janice with
laughter while the boys sister giggled desperately too

Whats the matter now he demanded in some surprise

Another lapsus linguaeI looked it up and that is what they
call it said Janice
Say Why dont you talk so people can understand you Gummy
demanded Dont talk Latin to a fellow

And you sounded as though you were using pigLatin laughed
Amy You said we strought to see Mr Stout

Oh Jicksy Did I exclaimed the boy Im always saying one
thing and meaning another arent I Is that a lapsus linguae

It is in this case Gummy But go ondo

Well Mr Strout looks just like a piece of that greenspeckled
cheese Mr Hardman has in his showcase in the face I mean

In the face of the showcase giggled Amy

Or the face of the cheese asked Janice demurely

Now say you girls go too far complained Gummy yet
goodnaturedly I mean Strouts face It looks like the
cheese for hes all speckled And the cheese is called
Rockyford and tastes funnier than it looks

Oh oh cried Janice youve got your cheese mixed with melons
this time It is Rockyford melons and Roquefort cheese

Jicksy They sound pretty near the same grumbled Gummy
Anyhow that is how Abel Strout looks in the facespeckled
And he came in in that yellow dustcoat of his looking like a
peeled saplingso long and lean

My what a wealth of description you have at your tongues end
cried Janice still in a gale of laughter A face like
Roquefort cheese with a figure like a peeled sapling Well

You keep on you girls and I wont ever get anywhere
complained Gummy

Go on Gummy urged Janice

Well he was just as nastymean as he always is The only time
I ever saw him pleasant was when he was wheedling mother out of
her money before she bought the house But he started in real
bossy this time

I should say he did agreed Amy feelingly

Well Mrs Carringford said Strout I hope you are ready to
take up that mortgage right now without no hanging back He
knew of course that mother didnt have a whole thousand dollars
leftno sir He knows all right just what she had in the
beginning and that weve been living off it for more than a
year said Gummy

So mother told him she could not take up the mortgage That she
did not dare put any more money into the place except the
interest and the taxesuntil prospects were brighter

Well he saidmean old hunksmoney is dreadful
tight right now and I dont see how I can let you have
a thousand any longer Taint in the bill of
agreement

Mother said Mr Strout when you sold me the place you said I
could have plenty of time to pay for it You knew my children
were small and that I could not do much toward paying the
mortgage until they grew bigger and could help

You got anything like that writ into your contract asked Mr
Strout

It was verbally understood said mother

That dont mean nothin in business said Strout I might
tell you the moon was made o green cheese but I wouldnt
guarantee it Talks one thing a written guarantee is another
That mortgage is writ for a year and the year is up

Oh exclaimed Gummy hotly I could have hit him for speaking
so mean to my mother

I dont blame you Janice said sympathetically But never
mind Tell the rest

Why all mother could say was what your father told her to say
She said You said when you were here several weeks ago that you
would let me pay off some of the principal and let the mortgage
stand

How much he snapped at herjust like a hungry dog
at a bone you know continued Gummy

I will spare fifty dollars said mother

Fifty fiddlestrings shouted Strout Wont hear to it
Wont listen to it

But already you see chuckled Gummy mother had pushed the
interest money toward him across the table He grabbed it He
couldnt keep his hands off real money I guesshis own or
anybody elses

Oh Gummy murmured Amy

Well didnt he just act so cried the boy Why he counted
that interest money just as hungrily And he folded it and put
it in his wallet

You tell it just as it was sighed Amy Of course I do Well
mother said You can give me my receipt for that Mr Strout if
you dont mind And then he did go off the handle chortled
Gummy You see he had tricked himself

How was that Gummy Janice asked wonderingly

He made mother pay interest on the note six months in advance
When he accepted that interest hewhat do you call itOh He
tacitly renewed the note which runs what they call concurrently
with the mortgage So the mortgage is good for another year

Oh Is that what daddy told your mother to do cried Janice
Now I understand exclaimed the delighted
Gummy

Oh Daddy didnt mean it as a trick

Not a tricky trick explained Gummy volubly Of course not
But mother just let Mr Strout trick himself When he saw what
he had done he tried to hand the money back but mother said

Oh no sir You can give me the written receipt or not just
as you please Both of these children thats Amy and mesaw
me give you the money and know its purpose Their testimony is
good in court

You have refused any payment on the principal of the mortgage
but you have accepted interest for the ensuing six months You
have therefore renewed the note for a year as it is written for
a year

Oh wasnt Strout mad chuckled Gummy

And I was proud of mamma added Amy

You bet Strout said to mother Somebodys been talking to
youI can see that

Yes they have she told him And somebody who knows you
very well Mr Strout Meaning your father Janice of course

So you think you will hold on to this shack and make something
on it do you he remarked

At least mother answered I hope to keep it for a shelter
for my children and not lose what I have put in it

Well said he in such a nasty tone You just wait And then
he stamped out of the house

Oh but I am afraid of him sighed Amy He spoke so
threateningly

Yes Momsy and Amy think he has something up his sleeve said
Gummy carelessly But I think Abel Strout is licked thanks to
Mr Day

Janice was very careful to repeat the particulars of this scene
Gummy had so vividly related to her father in the evening

Maybe he has something up his sleeve as Gummy says Janice
observed Can that be possible do you think Daddy

Well it is hard to say Now that I have gone into this thing
for Mrs Carringford I suppose I might go a little deeper Do
you know if she had the title to that property searched before
she bought it

Ill ask her Daddy

Dont ask in a way to frighten her advised Mr Day on second
thought It may be all right Just ask her who looked up the
title Tell her I will have the money ready for her to take up
Strouts mortgage when it becomes due next time but that
meanwhile I shall have to have the title searched if that was not
done before

Oh Daddy do you believe there could be somesome

Some flaw in it asked her father supplying the word that
Janice had heard but could not remember

Yes

There might be This is an old part of Greensboro and some of
the old titles conflicted

But then Mrs Carringford would not have to lose would she
Wouldnt Mr Strout have to give her back her money

Perhaps not Not if he could prove that he knew nothing about
the flaw in the title Or rather not if Mrs Carringford could
not prove that Strout did know his title was fraudulent
Besides the place might have been sold for taxes some time
That would invalidate the title in this state unless the
original owner or his heirs who owed the taxes had
quitclaimed

Dear me Daddy Day she cried it sounds awfully complicated

It is for little girls But we will see what we shall see
which to say the least was not a very comforting statement

Janice had found a colored woman who lived at the end of Love
Street to take the washing home each week and who did it very
satisfactorily But the woman had small children and so could
not go out to work

Besides such women as they had hired to come in to work by the
day had been very unsatisfactory Nobody seemed to take any
interest in the work

Why Janice thought we havent even cleaned house properly
this spring And here it is Juneand school almost closing

It was a fact that the last few days of the spring term were at
hand Janice was so busy that she did not know what to do When
she went to see Mrs Carringford to ask her the question Daddy
had told her to put she broke down and cried telling Amys
mother how bad she felt about the house

I got down the curtains and put them to soak but I cant starch
them and put them on the stretcher and hang them again
confessed Janice The house looks so bare And every inch of
paint needs scrubbingeven in the rooms that Mrs Watkins shut
up so tight She did not clean the paint

Cant you hire somebody to help you asked Mrs Carringford

If you mean can daddy pay for ithed be glad to cried
Janice But I just cant find anybody at all

I might come over and help you a couple of days Janice said
Mrs Carringford doubtfully

Oh Could you

I cant come very early in the morning but Amy can get supper
for the children so that I could stay until after your dinner at
night Janice

Mrs Carringford if youll come and help us gasped Janice I
think Ill just cry for joy

Dont do that my dear Of course this is only a stopgap
But I will try to do what I can for you toward cleaning house and
putting everything to rights again

And a single days work made such a difference Daddy came into
the house toward evening without knowing what Janice had arranged
with Mrs Carringford and began to snuff at once

Why Janice how clean everything smells he cried when the
girl ran to meet him What is happening

We are cleaning house At least she is

She Who he cried

Youll never guess

IISurely none of the neighbors has taken pity on us and come
in to clean

That is exactly what has happened Janice said Mrs
Carringford Daddy

Mrs Carringford he repeated Not come to work for us

Oh dear I wish she was going to work for us all the time
confessed the girl with a sigh But she is going to put us all
straight once more at least The children dont want her to go
out to work but she will do this for us

Well small mercies thankfully received larger ones in
proportion murmured daddy The whole house to be cleaned
once more And without my Janice to be dragging herself to
death

Oh Daddy

Well I have been worried dear he confessed I wrote your
Aunt Almira half promising that you should go to see them after
school closed

Oh Daddy shrieked Janice again To Poketown

You wont find it so bad And you need a rest I believe This
old house

Oh you shant talk so about our beautiful home gasped
Janice

If it is going to be such a burden to you my dear

It isnt It isnt  she cried excitedly and actually stamping
her feet You dont mean to shut up our home Daddy I wont
hear to it and she burst into a flood of tears

Mrs Carringford came into the livingroom neat smiling and
very very good to look upon the man thought It was a blessing
to have a real housekeeper and homemaker as well in the house

Quite overwrought Mr Day she said putting her arms about the
sobbing Janice She works too hard and tries to do too much

I know it he said shaking his head

And besides said the good woman Janice is growing up She
is growing too fast perhaps And she does need Mr Day
something that no fatherno matter how willing and thoughtful he
may becan give her

That is asked the man paling a little

The companionship of a woman Mr Day said Mrs Carringford
She should be more with some woman whom you can trust Not the
women you have had here to work for you

Janice had run away to bathe her eyes and make herself tidy
Broxton Day listened to this womans advise with a serious
countenance

I was just suggesting her going to spend a part of the summer
with her aunt in Vermont And she doesnt want to he
explained

That would take her a long way from you and from her home She
loves her home Mr Day Janice is a born homemaker I believe

What can I do then exclaimed the man at his wits end
Were any people ever situated so unfortunately as Janice and I

There have been thousands like you and your daughter said Mrs
Carringford Janice will be all right after school closes for
she will not have so much to do Let her books rest this summer
See that she plays instead of works If you will let her be a
good deal with other girls

I would be willing to have her fill the house with them Only
that too adds to the work

Well well see sighed Mrs Carringford preparing to go back
to the kitchen She can run over and see my Amy and Amy can
come here They are about the same age and like kittens they
should play more than work I will gladly do what I can for you
Mr Day You have been very kind to me and mine

He wanted to tell her that that was not so That he had really
done nothing and the favor was on the other side But she
hurried away to attend to dinner

And it was a nice dinner that was served at the Day table that
evening Like the fadedout lady Mrs

Carringford sat down to eat with them But there was a different
air about Mrs Carringford She was really a gentlewoman

Janice recovered her spirits and chattered like a magpie and Mr
Day himself found that for the first time in many months he had
really enjoyed a wellcooked meal and a social meal at his own
table

Mrs Carringford came day after day until the entire house was
cleaned Daddy found a man to clean up the yard cart away
ashes smooth the walks and dig over the flowerbeds The local
florist supplied growing plants for out of doors and the Day
place bloomed again as it was wont to do when Mrs Day was alive

Meanwhile Janice and her mates were just as busy as bees
concluding the spring term at school There were the final
examinations which were now close at hand Janice really trembled
over these

My sakes Amy what if I shouldnt pass Im awfully shaky on
physiology especially

Goodness Janice youll pass of course Anybody as bright and
quick as you are

Its awfully nice of you to say that But my recitations have
gone off like anything lately and I really am afraid of these
exams

Amy tried to comfort her friend but with little success

Then there were many outside pleasures and Janice in a happier
mood this time remarked that school really did interfere with
the real business of lifesuch as the picnics that the beautiful
spring days made so thoroughly pleasurable

Dear me Id like to go to a picnic every day she sighed
happily to Amy one Saturday afternoon after jolly hours spent
with the boys and girls of her circle of closest friends in the
woods now white with dogwood

Some of the girls were going away for a part of the summer
vacation But Janice would not admit that she even contemplated
such a change

Stella Latham was one of those who expected to migrate She was
going to some relatives who had a summer place on the shore of
one of the Great Lakes and she talked a good deal about it

But she did not talk to Janice All she said in the latters
hearing was something that only puzzled and annoyed Daddys
daughter I guess if somebody who thinks she is so smart only
knew what I know about that Swedish girl Olga shed give her
very eyes to have me tell herso now

I dont even know what she means confessed Janice wearily to
Amy

She just means to be meanthats all said the practical Amy



CHAPTER XXII SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN

I hope something will happen so I cant go to Poketown was the
thought continually rising to the surface of the troubled pool of
Janice Days mind

She did not know what Mrs Carringford had said to daddy nor how
much he had been influenced by that wise womans observations
regarding this very matter So as the days went by Janice
continued to fear the worst

For the very worst that could happen Janice thought was for her
to be separated from her father and from her home When the
possibility of his having to go to Mexico was first talked about
the thought of their separation had made a very deep impression
on the girls mind She had never recoveredhow could she
from the going away of her mother If her father went out of
her life too it seemed to Janice as though she would be an
orphan indeed

So without knowing anything personally about her Aunt Almira or
Uncle Jason or Marty her cousin the girl felt that their
association could in no way replace that of daddy

I just wish something would happen so that I couldnt go to
Poketown was repeated over and over in her thought

Perhaps that is wicked Janice told herself But wicked or
not it does seem as though it would just kill me to leave home

After Mrs Carringford had finished cleaning house the home
seemed so much better and brighter that Janice loved it more than
ever She did not want to leave Eight Hundred and Fortyfive
Knight Street even for a day

I dont care if Arlo Junior does toll cats into our back kitchen
and we entertain dancing bears and that halfcrazy Delia and
folks like Mrs Watkins or Olga Cedarstrom she said to daddy
This is just the nicest house in all the world Dont you think
so yourself Daddy

I never expect to have so much happiness in another house as I
have had in this one my dear Mr Day said And we will hope
for more happiness here in the future But my little girl must
not try to do everything It is all right to be a homemaker but
you must not try to do it all yourself We must find somebody to
help regularly

Secretly Janice was urging Mrs Carringford to come every day to
the house and keep it in that neat as a new pin condition in
which the sweetnatured woman had left it when the extra cleaning
was finished

But my dear child how will my own house get along without me
Amy cannot do it all even if it is vacationtime

But dear Mrs Carringford just think begged Janice Kate
and Sydney are both big enough to help Amy

And they are a team sighed Mrs Carringford

Theyll be good They will do a good deal for me said Janice
frankly

You bribe the twins

Oh they are only teeny weeny bribes and of course children
expect pay when they do things for you Look how eagerly Gummy
works for his pay for Gummy was working every day for Mr
Harriman now and his wages had been doubled

Dont let him hear you catalogue him as a child said the boys
mother smiling I must do nothing to neglect my own brood
Yet I feel that I must earn money Gummys wages will not even
feed us And it will last only until September He must go back
to school again then

Then come and see daddy urged Janice You know hell be more
than glad to have you Why it would be just heavenly for us

I must think about it said the overurged woman If I could
get work in a store downtown I would have more regular hours
perhaps For a home cannot be kept on an eighthouraday
schedule

But Janice hoped To do something to bring about peace and
comfort for daddy and herself had been her determination for
weeks If only Mrs Carringford could be coaxed to agree Janice
foresaw plain sailing

This had been her hope ever since she had seen how perfectly
Amys mother kept her own poor cottage It had been her hope
when she had first brought Mrs Carringford and Mr Day together
But would her hope come to fruition

Nevertheless she was happier now that she did not have to go to
school She had time to work out of doors in the flowerbeds and
to get dainty little suppers sometimes for daddy

Yet at other times she was very tired She showed daddy a
cheerful countenance almost always But there were occasions
when Janice Day felt anything but cheerful inside as she
expressed it

Somehow daddy seemed to guess however when she was not quite
herself during these sultry days for often at breakfast he said

Daughter dress yourself in your best bib and tucker and meet me
at the corner of Joyce Street at fourthirty Ill be on the
Maplewood car and will save a seat for you We will go out to
the Branch Inn for supper

Such excursions delighted Janice especially with daddy It made
her feel positively grown up to be taken about by such a
wellgroomed and handsome man as Broxton Day

And almost everywhere they went people seemed to know daddy
Even the managers and waiters at the inns and restaurants knew
him for Mr Day often attended business conferences and
luncheons with the banks customers at these places

Sometimes very well dressed men came and sat down at their table
and talked business with Broxton Day They were always very kind
and polite to Janice

But whenever she heard Mexico and the Mexican mines mentioned
the girl was worried and listened attentively She knew that
those properties down beyond the Rio Grande in which her father
was interested so deeply were still in a very uncertain state
As yet dividends from her fathers investment she knew had been
very small

She thought daddy watched her very closely at times His keen
glance seemed almost like that of a person lying in wait for
one That was the way Janice expressed it to herself

She did not understand what these looks meant Did he doubt that
she was really quite as cheerful and happy as she would appear

On her own part after she had gone to bed Janice Day listened
often for his step to and fro hour after hour on the
honeysucklesheltered porch Was he thinking about the lost
letters Would neither he nor his daughter ever be able to get
overto forget the mementoes of dear mother and their
disappearance with Olga Cedarstrom

Janice often cried herself to sleep thinking of this loss But
she cried quietly so that daddy should not hear her and she was
always very careful in the morning to remove all traces of tears
or sleeplessness before appearing in his presence at the
breakfast table

Whats been done today daughter was often daddys question
at night accompanied by one of his keenly interrogating glances

When she catalogued the days industries sometimes he shook his
head

But where is the fun When do you play What have you been
doing to celebrate your freedom from the scholastic yoke he
would demand

Weell you know Daddy I cant be a gadabout all the timeand
with Miss Peckham watching me from behind her blinds every time I
go out and she giggled

Miss Peckham be eternally Hem I dont suppose I can use
strong language in regard to the lady who has washed her hands of
us can I

Not very strong language Daddy she rejoined laughing aloud
now

Well in that case well merely ignore our neighbor That means
you too Janice and you must play a little more in spite of
Miss Peckham

But Daddy I do play as you call it There was the picnic in
Emmons Woods and the straw ride to Clewitt

And the picnic on the Latham farm to which I found you did not
go interrupted daddy How about that daughter

Ohohwell you know Daddy II

Whats all this stammering about honey asked daddy putting
his arm about his daughter

Daddy Amy and I just couldnt go to that picnic Of course it
was not given by Stella but by all the boys and girls of our
crowd but it was on Stellas farm And Well Daddy Stella
doesnt really like Amy and me just now Its nothingjust
about that dress Amy wore to Stellas party I told you all
about that Stella promised not to tell you know and then she
did Im not mad at StellaI was though for a whilebut
shes still mad at me Shell be all right in a little while
though Daddy

I trust so daughter Do your best to make friends again You
will all be happier if you are on a friendly footing with your
companions

These first days of the long vacation were not really happy ones
for Janice although she tried to make believe they were All
the time she was hoping to herself that daddy would not insist on
her visiting his relatives in the East

He had not really said that he contemplated sending her
willynilly to Aunt Almira Yet the girl felt that daddy
believed her health called for a change And that was not what
she needed She was sure that the air of Poketown would never in
this world make her feel any happier or healthier than she felt
right here at home in Greensboro

I just hope something will happen to keep me from going to
Poketownor anywhere else Janice repeated over and over
again

And then it did happen Nothing that she had imagined of
course

And this happening shocked Janice Day almost as much as anything
could It came in the afternoon when she was getting dinner for
daddy She heard the clang of a gong and an automobile stopped
before the house She ran to the window It was a white painted
ambulance not from the City Hospital but a private ambulance
And two men in white uniforms were preparing to take somebody on
a stretcher out of the car



CHAPTER XXIII THE SILVER LINING TO A VERY BLACK CLOUD

Janice dropped the mixing spoon and the dishcloth and ran out
upon the side porch and from thence down the steps and the walk
to the gate Her heart beat so that she could scarcely get her
breath

The white uniformed men were drawing the stretcher out of the
ambulance and Janice horrified and all but breathless suddenly
saw her father sitting up on the stretcher

Dont be scared Janice Be a brave girl he cried It is
only my leg

Butbut what have they done to your leg Daddy she cried
wringing her hands

One of the uniformed men laughed It was a cheerful laugh and
he was a jolly looking man But Janice thought it was very easy
indeed for him to laugh

It isnt his legor any of his relations she thought

I tell you what they have done to him he said taking hold of
both handles at the foot of the stretcher They have just set a
compound fracture below the knee and put it into splints Your
daddy is going to have a glass leg for some time to come and you
must take good care of it Where shall we carry him

While he spoke and the other man was taking hold of the other
handles of the stretcher Mr Day lay down again He did not
groan but he was very white He gave Janices hand a strong
grip however when she got to him

Pluck up your courage dear he said This is no killing
matter

But now neighbors began to hurry to them Children of course
for Knight Street was well supplied with them But Mrs Arlo
Weeks and Mrs Peckinpaw came from across the street while Miss
Peckham appeared from her cottage

Dear me Was he picked up that way asked Mrs Weeks in her
high strident tone My Arlo had a fit once

Taint a fit said Mrs Peckinpaw who was a very old woman and
who never spoke to Miss Peckham because of some neighborhood
squabble which had happened so long before that neither of them
remembered what it was about

Taint a fit she said acidly for then they foam at the
mouth or drool I never knew he had anything the matter with
him chronic

The jolly looking man laughed Miss Peckham on the other side of
the stretcher and without looking at the other women asked

Oughtnt he be took to the hospital Theres nobody here to
take care of him but that flyaway young one

I wont have him taken to a hospital cried Janice stormily
You bring him right into the house

Well taint fittin said Miss Peckham decidedly

I guess both Mr Day and his daughter know what they want said
the cheerful looking man decidedly He wanted to be brought
home Now my little lady where shall we put him All ready
Bill

All ready said Bill who had the handles at the head of the
stretcher

But whats the matter with him demanded Mrs Peckinpaw again
Is it ketchin

He has a compound fracture of the tibia declared the cheerful
man

Oh My mercy ejaculated Mrs Peckinpaw shrinking away from
the stretcher II didnt kmow Mr Day drank

She had evidently heard alcoholism called by so many queer
sounding terms that anything she not understand she set down to
that dread trouble But Miss Peckham had run ahead into the
house

Take him right up to his bedroom she said commandingly to the
men with the stretcher

Well if that womans goin to take hold they dont need me
said Mrs Peckinpaw snappishly and she retained her stand upon
the strictly neutral ground of the sidewalk

Mrs Arlo Weeks was all of a quiver as she herself said She
followed the men as far as the steps and there sank to a seat

My my I feel just like fainting she murmured

Meanwhile the two uniformed men were carrying Mr Day into the
house

Right up here cried Miss Peckham from the stairway

No said Mr Day put me on the couch in the living room Fix
it Janice

At this Janice awoke from her apathy She rushed in ahead and
fixed the pillows on the couch and got a warm cover to put over
him

Im to be laid up some weeks Mr Day said courageously I
dont want to be put upstairs where I dont know a thing about
whats going on in the house Ill stay downstairs

That couch ought to be made up like a bed for you Mr Day
said the cheerful man as Janice dropped down the back which made
it into a bedlounge

Do that later said Mr Day Here Wheres Mrs Weeks

Janice ran to call her Miss Peckham was descending the stairs
her nose in the air She seemed offended that she could not rule
the proceedings

Mrs Weeks said Janice to the woman from across the street
will you come in Father wants to speak to you

II dont know as my legs will carry me sighed Mrs Weeks
Have they put him to bed Has he got his cloes off

He just wishes to speak to you explained Janice Right in
here

She led the way into the living room Miss Peckham was still
sniffing in the doorway The two ambulance men were preparing
to depart

When Arlo Weeks comes home from business tell him I want to see
him said Mr Day to the woman Hell help me off with my
clothes and get me into bed here I shall be all right

He spoke quite cheerfully now and even Janice was recovering her
selfpossession

Oh well Ill telI him murmured Mrs Weeks Im sick o
shock myself But we have to sacrifice when our neighbors needs
us Yes Mr Day Ill send Arlo over

She trailed out after the two men Mrs Peckham sniffed after
her too

Well the spinster said I can make him some broth Hell need
nourishing victuals And he aint been gettin anything of late
I guess but what that childs messed up

She departed kitchenward Janice and daddy looked at each other
hopelessly Then together and in chorus they murmured

But I thought she had washed her hands of us

I dont want broth grumbled Broxton Day after a minute I
want my dinner What have you got thats good Janice

Stewlamb stew Nice she groaned And plenty of vegetables
like you like

Like you like is almost as good as the stew will be chuckled
her father faintly We must get that woman out of the house
Janice She will be an Old Man of the Sea

No no giggled the girl An Old Maid of the Sea you
mean

Maybe I do But how to get rid of her

I know Wait Janice dashed out of the room and out of the
house A crowd of children was still at the gate

Arlo Junior she called into the dusk Come here I want you

You want my pa He aint home yet said Junior drawing near
slowly

I want you to do an errand for me said Janice hastily Come
hereclose Ill tell you Your mother wont mind

All right said Junior offering an attentive ear

You know where Gummy Carringford lives

Course I do

Well you run there and see his mother and you tell her

Janice in whispers told the boy just what to say to Mrs
Carringford and he repeated it before he darted off on the
errand Arlo Junior was a great boy to play tricks but he would
not play them at such a time as this

Janice went back to her fathers side and left Miss Peckham whom
she heard moving about the kitchen strictly alone Daddy told
her all about the accident

It seemed when he came down the stairs from the Chamber of
Commerce where he had gone on an errand a scrubwoman had left a
cake of soap on the next to the top step

Of course it was just my luck to find it for her said Broxton
Day with rather a grim laugh Maybe she wanted that soap But
I did not I kicked right up Janice and it is a wonder I did
not break my back as well as my leg

Oh Daddy

I landed so hard at the bottom of the flight that I was
unconscious for a few minutes Luckily Dr Bowles the surgeon
has offices in that very building They picked me up and carried
me to him and he fixed up the leg It will be as good as new he
says after a while

Oh dear Daddy you might have been killed cried Janice
suddenly sobbing

Well its all over nowbut the shouting muttered Mr Day
his face suddenly contorted with pain Dont fuss my dear
This is something that can be mended I am sure Dont give way
to tears

Oh but Daddy I know I know sobbed the girl hiding her
face in his shoulder But something did happenand II wished
for it

Wished for me to break my leg gasped daddy

Oh no Oh no But I wished something would happen so that I
would not have to go to live at Poketown this summer
Andnowsomethinghashappened

Quite true my dear said Mr Day after a moments silence
You got your wish But as usual you did not get it just as you
wished it Still the very blackest cloud has its silver
lining

Janice could not imagine a silver lining to this cloud not just
at that moment She only realized that daddy was suffering from
an accident that it did seem her wish had brought to him It was
a very serious and disturbing thought for the girl

Janice did not want to go out into the kitchen to see what Miss
Peckham was about She had left the tender breast and shoulder
of lamb for the stew simmering on the back of the stove and the
vegetables were all ready to put in it What the spinster would
do toward making broth Janice did not know And daddy did not
want broth

Just now however the girl felt too much disturbed to entertain
an argument with Miss Martha Peckham Things would have to go on
as they would until

Suddenly Janice heard voices in the kitchen Miss Peckhams
highpitched voice and another Janice saw that her father was
quiet and did not notice so she got up from his side and stole
to the kitchen door to listen

Well maam exclaimed Miss Peckham dont see as its any more
of your business than tis mine Im makin this gruel

And I will finish preparing the dinner if you do not mind Miss
Peckham said the soft voice Mrs Carringford I see that
Janice has it almost ready Do you think Miss Peckham that a
man with a broken leg needs gruel

Well I couldnt find nothing to make broth out of

Or broth pursued Mrs Carringford I know Mr Days
appetite and I do not believe that broken leg

has made it any the less hearty

Seems to me you know a good deal snapped Miss Peckham
Specially about this kitchen

You know I have been working here for some time Mrs
Carringford said Thank you Miss Peckham You need not stay
If there is anything we need you for I will let you know
Goodnight

The spinster banged out at the kitchen door without even coming
into the front part of the house

Not even to wash her hands of us again giggled Janice who
ran out into the kitchen with a cry of joy

Oh Mrs Carringford she said throwing her arms about the
womans neck have you really come to stay

I guess I shall have to my dear Daytimes anyway said Amys
mother kissing her Youd soon go to rack and ruin here with
the neighbors coming in and littering everything up Yes tell
your father I will accept the offer he made me And now well
have dinner just as soon as possible How is he

He says he is all right gasped Janice catching her breath
And he says there is always a silver lining to the very blackest
cloud Now I know hes right You are the silver lining to this
cloud Mrs Carringfordyou really truly are



CHAPTER XXIV WHERE THERES SMOKE THERES FIRE

If it had not been for Mrs Carringfords presence in the house
this experience certainly would have been a very hard one for
Janice Day For although the trials of housekeeping had been
serious for the young girl they were not all that had so vexed
her and weighted her mind with sorrow

But her fathers injury shocked her out of the mental rut which
she had been following She had to wait on him hand and foot
and it gave her so many new thoughts and new things to do that
for a time at least Janice Days old troubles were pretty much
sloughed away

They had managed to make Mr Day comfortable on the livingroom
couch and it was easier to care for him there than it would have
been were he in his bedroom Besides he very much objected to
being invalided to the upper story while he was tied down with
a broken leg

Mr Arlo Weeks came in night and morning to help turn the injured
man and remake his bed Mr Weeks was after all a good
neighbor he was more helpful than anybody else who came to the
Day house save Mrs Carringford

The surgeon came now and then to restrap the broken leg Some of
Mr Days business associates called to see how he was getting
on The injured man was not hard to take care of He could
read propped up on the couch and although he suffered
considerable pain he did not allow Janice to discover that he was
uncomfortable

But at first he did net sleep well at night and he had some
fever Mrs Carringford was careful in his diet and she never
seemed to contradict him or to thwart his wishes She had a way
with her that Janice could but admire and pattern after

The girl saw that even daddy was not quite his very sensible self
when he was an invalid He had to be humored at times and they
did all that was possible to keep him from fretting

Broxton Day had been a very active man Business affairs of
which he had sole charge were bound to go wrong when he could not
wield power as he was wont And these things all bothered him
when the nagging pain of the broken leg increased as it
sometimes did at night

Oh what should I have done without you Mrs Carringford
breathed Janice often taking comfort in the kindly womans arms
for a momentary hug I do think Amy and Gummy and the little
ones are awfully nice not to make any more objection than they do
to your being up here

Oh they quarrel enough with me about it at times laughed Mrs
Carringford But I tell them if it was not here it would have
to be somewhere else I have got to work my dear I can see
that plainly Every day the appetites of my little family
increase and their needs grow The rate at which Kate and Edna
May and Syd wear out shoes Well

Let them go barefooted giggled Janice I know they are
teasing you all the time about it

No cried Mrs Carringford with warmth I know we live in
Mullen Lane and it is not always possible for me to dress my
children as nicely as I wish but they shall not run barefoot
like the little hoodlums that live about us And Syd bothers me
to death about it

But Janice could only laugh a bit at this She herself sometimes
ran barefooted around the house and yard though she was growing
too big for that now and she did not blame the little
Carringfords for wanting to do so

At any rate she was very very grateful to Mrs Carringford for
stepping into the breach at this time and helping themand
grateful to Amy and Gummy as well

Amy was a smart little housewife and she had a gentle but firm
way with the smaller children that kept them well in hand when
their mother was out of the way

Gummy driving Mr Harrimans delivery wagon was at the Day
house once or twice a day to see his mother and of course Mrs
Carringford was always at home by seven or eight oclock at
night The Days had set forward their dinner hour while Mr Day
was held in the house

Janice would not sleep upstairs herself at first while her
father so often needed her She made up a bed on another couch
that was drawn in from the dining room and slept there Often
in the night daddy grew restless and was thankful for a glass of
fresh water or for some other small comfort

There was one night Janice knew she should never forget no
matter to what age she lived It was soon after her father was
brought home an invalid as he laughingly called it He had
been in much pain all day and Janice new it well enough
although he smothered his groans when she was within hearing

But he could not smother his mutterings at night Toward dark he
grew feverish and very restless And when one has a glass leg
as the ambulance man had called it and cannot twist and toss to
relieve that restless feeling ones situation is indeed
pitiful

Janice put out the livingroom light early The light only made
the night flying insects buzz and blunder at the window screens
And how is it that moth millers will get into the most closely
screened house This was a vexing mystery to Janice

After it was dark and the insects went to buzz elsewhere daddy
dropped to sleep Janice had been upstairs to remove her
clothing and had come down again with a thin negligee over her
nightgown

She listened to her fathers uneven breathing and to his restless
murmurs Before creeping into her own cot across the room she
went softly to daddys side and knelt on the floor His face was
flushed and his thick hair wet with perspiration The barber had
not been to shave him for two days and Janice just knew the
prickles on his face must feed very uncomfortable

His head rolled from side to side upon the pillow She wished
she could do something to relieve him She did not want to wake
him up but if she could only lave his face and hands with cool
water

Suddenly his mutterings became intelligible Janice was held
there on her kneesabsorbed and almost breathless

Laura

The name was uttered so passionatelyso reverently that
Janice found the tears spring unbidden to her eyes Daddy had
spoken her dead mothers name in his sleep Indeed it seemed as
though he called to the loved one who had gone from them never to
return

Laura

Daddy breathed the girl Its me not mamma I Im all
thats left to you

He seemed even in his sleep to have heard Janices murmured
words

All that was left to me Broxton Day sighed repeating as
Janice thought what she had said Or did he repeat Janices
words Your dear thoughts and gone gone If I could only
find them again The boxOlga His mutterings trailed off into
unrecognizable delirium He muttered and his inflamed face
moved from side to side upon the pillow He did not know her at
all this heartsick sobbing little daughter

For Janice could understand at last what went on in his poor
troubled brain He was dreaming of the packet of lettersthe
letters that were so precious to Broxton Day In the secret
compartment of the lost treasurebox In the fever of the mans
brain nothing else seemed so important to him as his lost wifes
letters

Of course all of Janice Days school friends did not go away
from Greensboro for the summer vacation or if they did go away
for a little visit they were soon back again

And when the girls heard that Janices father had broken his leg
and that Janice was tied to the house with him they began to
come to see her and inquire about daddy and cheer her up

None of them realized that with Mrs Carringford at the head of
housekeeping affairs Janice had not felt so free and cheerful
for some months as she did at this time

Daddy soon grew better and he began to sleep peacefully at
night The surgeon Dr Bowles who came occasionally said the
bones were knitting all right Mr Weeks and Janice even got the
patient up into a wheel chair which had an arrangement that made
it possible for the broken leg to rest stiffly before daddy and
he could wheel himself out on the front

porch

There was just the one thing to trouble the girl that was the
mystery of the lost treasurebox and the secret sorrow she felt
because she had been careless with it Without her carelessness
she told herself Olga Cedarstrom would never have taken it out
of the house if that was really how the keepsakes had come to
disappear

It was Bertha Warring who chanced when she first came to see
Janice after her return from an exciting trip to Chicago to
mention that girl Olga At least she spoke of the Olga who
had been at the Latham house and had broken Mrs Lanthams glass
dish the night of Stellas party

I meant to speak to you about what Stella said Bertha remarked
before I went away But we went in such a hurry You know
Stella can be awfully mean

Why shes not always nice admitted Janice whose opinion of
the farmers daughter had changed a good deal during the past few
months

I must say you let Stella down easy when you say that laughed
Bertha

Oh she gets mad and says mean things But I dont think

Now stop it Janice Day exclaimed the other girl You know
very wall that Stella is just as mean as a girl can be See how
she spoke of Amy Carringford And Amy is an awfully nice girl

Yes Amy is nice admitted Janice happily

Well now look here said Bertha earnestly Stella said
something you did not hear once about that Swedish girl

Oh I guess I am not particularly interested in that girl
Janice said slowly My father asked the Johnsons about her
You know that girl was staying with them at the time of the
party She ran away I guess because she was afraid Mrs Latham
would make trouble about the broken dish But the Johnsons said
her name was not Cedarstrom

Mercy what a name laughed Bertha Just the same there is
something about that girl that Stella knows and that she said
you would give a good deal to know

Why I cant imagine

Thats just it said Bertha quickly It sounded so
mysterious I ought to have told you about it there and then
But you know how jumbled up everything was just the last days of
school

That is so admitted the puzzled Janice

But you know Stella and I went away on the same train
together

No Did you

Yes She changed cars before we got to Chicago but she sat in
the chair car with me for a long way And I pumped her about
what she meant when she spoke the way she did regarding that
Swede

Yes

Why she giggled and made fun and wouldnt say anything much
at first But I hammered at her said Bertha until I got her
mad You know Stella loses her temper and thenwell its all
off and Bertha laughed gaily

Oh Bert admonished Janice warmly I dont think we ought to
get her mad

Oh shell get glad again said Bertha carelessly Dont worry
about Stella Miss Fussbudget

Janice laughed then herself She did not mind Bertha Warrings
sharp tongue

Well as I was saying I got her finally to say something more
about that Olga And what do you suppose she did say

I could not guess said the wondering Janice

Why that it was very true her name was not Cedarstrom now
That is just the way she said it before she got up and flounced
out of the car Oh Bert gasped Janice

Do you see I was some minutes catching on to it Bertha said
rather slangily But you see I guess That girl had been known
as Olga Cedarstrom at some time or other you mark my word
And Stella found it out and would not tell you

Then she must be married Of course her name is not Cedarstrom
now murmured Janice

Oh Is that it I didnt know but she was a real crook said
Bertha and had what they call an alias

Noo I dont believe so The last daddy learned about her over
at Pickletown some of the Swedish people there thought she must
have gone off to get married She was going with a young man who
works in one of the pickle factories His name is Willie
Sangreen

And whats become of him asked the interested Bertha

He went away too

They ran off and got married Of course cried the
romanceloving Bertha And that Stella Latham found it out and
wouldnt tell you Maybe your father Oh but he cant go
looking for them now that he has a broken leg can he

I am afraid not Well have to wait But do you really
suppose Bert that Stella is sure of what she says Perhaps she
doesnt really know for sure about that Olga

Where theres so much smoke there must be some fire Bertha
said with a laugh as Janice walked out to the front gate with
her I guess Stella knows Oh Janice Talking about smoke
cried Bertha suddenly looking back at the Day house and up at
the roof what is all that smoke coming out of your kitchen
chimney

Her startled friend looked in the direction indicated Out of the
chimneymouth and between the bricks poured a vomit of black
smoke Then as the girls looked red flames darted out with the
smoke spouting four or five feet into the air above the top of
the chimney



CHAPTER XXV ABEL STROUT AT THE ROOT OF IT

The shock of seeing the chimney on fire did not overcome Janice
Day as much as the thought that daddy was lying down resting in
the living room and that she would never be able to get him up
and into his wheelchair and out of doors before the whole house
was in a blaze

For those lurid flames darting out of the chimney looked very
terrifying indeed Bertha Warring ran out into the street
screaming but Janice darted back into the house

Somebody outside screamed Fire Fire Janice believed it must
have been Miss Peckham Little ever got past the sharp eyes of
that neighbor in the next cottage

Janice heard her father ejaculate some exclamation but she did
not go to him first She rushed instead to the telephone in
the hall

Seizing the receiver she rattled the hook up and down hoping to
get a quick response

Janice she heard her father call

Yes Daddy Im coming she cried Then her ear came the
leisurely question

Number please

Central give me the Fire Departmentplease ejaculated the
excited girl

Number please again drawled the unruffled Central

Oh quick Quick cried Janice into the instrument Give me
the Fire Department Our house is on fire

Great heavens ejaculated her father from the living room He
was awake and heard Janice now

Do be quick Central cried Janice The Fire De

Market two three hundred said Central

Its a wonder thought Janice even in her present state of
mind that she doesnt call Information

Janice Where is the fire called her father

Its the chimney Wait Daddy Ill come and help yon The
kitchen chim Oh

Somebody on the wire just then said crisply Central Fire
Station Whats wanted

Fire shouted Janice Our house Eightfortyfive Knight
Street

I hear you exclaimed the man at the other end and Janice
almost threw the receiver back on the hook and darted into the
living room

Mrs Carringford happened to be out Janice now that Bertha
Warring had deserted her was all alone in the house with the
injured man

Oh Daddy she gasped seeing him already in his chair

Give me a push child Where is the fire This is something
newthe first time the Days were ever burned out

Its the kitchen chimney But I cant get you down the front
steps

Meanwhile she was pushing him out on the porch People were
running toward the house now and many were shouting But it did
not look like a very helpful crowd

Just then Janice saw a wagon being driven rather wildly along the
street toward the house It was not a part of the Fire
Department equipment although she looked eagerly for that The
nearest fire station was fully half a mile from the Day house

The children in the street scattered as the horses pounding feet
on the macadam warned them of his approach The driver stood up
his feet braced against the dashboard yelling to the horse to
stop as he swung back on the reins

It was Gummy

Hi Janice Your chimneys on fire he shouted when he had
stopped the horse

Well for goodness sake exclaimed Janice doesnt he suppose
we know it with all this crowdand noise and everything

Gummy tumbled out of the covered wagon He came down on all
fours he was in such a hurry but he was up again in a moment

Hi Janice I can put it out if I can get out on to that ell
roof through that little window up there he cried

Thats the hired girls room gasped Janice

Whats he going to do Take pails of water out there and throw
them down the chimney

Give the boy a chance said daddy Maybe he can do
something And to Janices amazement her father was smiling

Gummy ran around to the back of the wagon He dropped the
tailboard backed around and got a bag on his shoulders With
this he staggered toward the house

Oh Gummy screamed Janice what have you got in that sack

Salt replied the boy panting up the steps Half a shushal
of balt I was takin it out to Joness

Salt gasped Janice in her excitement not noticing at all that
Gummy had again gummed up his speech to quote his own
expression Why what good is salt That chimney is blazing

Salt will do the trick Show me the way to that window Salt
will put out a fire in a chimney better than anything else

Let him have his way Janice said her father quickly

She thought she heard the gong of some of the fire apparatus
approaching but she was not sure She gave Gummy a hand and
they ran upstairs with the sack of salt between them

Here was the small room She flung open the door and Gummy flung
up the lower sash of the window He almost dived out upon the
tinned roof of the kitchen ell

Quick Give me that salt I he cried reaching in for it

Janice helped him lift the bag out of the window He dragged it
along the roof toward the chimney that now vomited black smoke
and flames in a very threatening volume Fortunately the light
wind drifted it away from the main part of the house

Oh Gummy youll be burned to deathand then what will your
mother say cried Janice

Gummy was so much in earnest that he did not even laugh at this
He dragged the sack of salt as close to the burning chimney as he
dared Then he got out his pocketknife and cut the string

Everybody in the street below was yelling to him by this time
telling him what to do and how to do it Gummy gave them little
attention

The smoke choked him and occasionally a tongue of flame seemed to
reach for him But Gummy Carringford possessed a good deal of
pluck and he was strong and wary for so young a boy Shielding
his face as best he could from the heat and smoke he began to
cast double handfuls of salt into the chimney

The chimney was fortunately not as high as his head and Gummy
could do this as well as a man The soot which had gathered in
the chimney perhaps it had not been cleaned out since the house
was built was mostly at the bottom and the flames came from
down there but the hot bricks would soon set the roof on fire
if not the walls inside the house

The salt smothered the fire wherever it landed It was better
than sand for such a purpose for salt is damp and seems to
possess smothering qualities all its own when rained upon the
flames

Before half the contents of the bag had been thrown down the
chimney the flames no longer leaped above its top The smoke
continued to roll up and Gummy had pretty well smothered it
himself when the Fire Department apparatus came clanging up to
the house

One of the fireman with a portable extinguisher rushed upstairs
got out at the small window and reached Gummys side quickly

Good boy kid he said Lets give it the lad and he began
to squirt the contents of the fire extinguisher down the chimney

Gummy staggered back and sat down coughing His face and hands
were pretty black and he was breathless When he got back
downstairs and the firemen had declared the conflagration
entirely extinguished Gummy found himself quite a hero

The excitement had hurt nobody after all Janice was glad Mrs
Carringford was not there at the time or she certainly would
have been worried about Gummy

You are an awfully smart boy Gummy Janice declared clinging
to the boys hand I wont ever make fun of you again when you
get mixed up in talking

Mr Day overheard this and laughed heartily He too shook Gummy
cordially by the hand

You have a head on you son he said How came you to think
about the salt

I saw a chimney on fire in the country once and they put it out
with salt the boy replied Ive got to hurry back to the
store and get more salt for the Joness now I guess Mr
Harriman will be mad

Oh no he wont Ill call him up on the telephone and tell him
to put this sack on my account He wont scold you I am sure
said Mr Day

In fact everybody who heard about the matter praised Gummy
Carringford They began to say that boy with the funny name is
considerable of a boy and things like that Mr Day gave him a
little money although Gummy did not want to take that

You treat your little brothers and sisters with it Janices
father said laughing They didnt have the fun of seeing you
put out the fire

Weell said the thoughtful boy Ill see what Momsy says
about it first

When Mrs Carringford returned to the house Mr Day himself told
her of the fire and of what Gummy had done and how proud she
should be of him too And Mrs Carringford was proudMr Day
could see that

Boys are awfully nice to have around the house arent they
Daddy Janice said that evening as they sat alone I never did
think before that Id care to have a brother You see you are
just like a brother to me Daddy

I see said Daddy chuckling When it comes to chimney fires
and such excitement a boy comes in handy is that it

Whyyees Berta Warring ran away crying and I couldnt do
much but squeal myself said Janice gravely

And telephone for the Fire Department and help me out and aid
Gummy to carry up the salt and

Oh but Daddy those are all such little things sighed
Janice

Janice thought things were going pretty well after that They
were so glad to have their house saved from destruction and so
proud of Gummy that everybody seemed all right But there was
trouble coming and one afternoon Amy brought it to the Day
house

Amy in tears came to see her mother Janice chanced to be in
the kitchen when she entered from the Love Street gate Amy had
in tow a curlyhaired dapper little man who looked too oily to be
honest and with little gimlet eyes that seemed to bore right
through one

Oh Mother gasped Amy thisthis mans come to take our
house away from us

What is this now exclaimed Mrs Carringford in as much
surprise as fear

Yes he has He said so Hes got papers and all sobbed
Amy

Ahem the young lady puts it very crassly indeed said the
curlyhaired man You I presume are Mrs Josephine
Carringford he went on reading from a paper

Yes

I am serving you in the suit of Mrs Alice G Blayne of
Croydon Michigan my client to recover a certain parcel of
property situated on Mullen Lane and now occupied by you and your
family Mrs Carringford said the man glibly and thrusting a
paper into the womans hand

But I bought my home through Mr Abel Strout of Napsburg
gasped Mrs Carringford She did not recognize Jamison the farm
hand in the transaction at all She now felt that man was but
Abel Strouts tool

Oh As to that I have nothing to say said the curlyhaired
lawyer smiling in a way Janice did not like at all I merely
represent my client The property has been claimed by several
people I believe and may have been sold a dozen times That
will not invalidate my clients claim

But I never even heard of this Mrs Blayne murmured Amys
mother

A poor widow maam said the lawyer blandly And one who can
ill afford to lose her rights She as heir of old Peter
Warburton Blayne who lived in that house where you now reside for
a great many years He died His heirs were not informed The
place was sold for taxesfor a nominal sum maam Of course a
taxdeed has no standing in court if the real owner of the
property comes forward ready to pay the back taxes accrued
interest and the fixed court charges

But I got a warranty deed cried Mrs Carringford

That is a matter between you and the person you say you bought
the house of said the lawyer calmly If you consider that you
have a case against him you will have to go to court with him
Ahem An expensive matter my dear madam I assure you
Probably the man who sold to you had every reason to believe he
had a clear title It has passed through several hands since
Peter Blayne died as I say

I cannot advise you as to that maam pursued the lawyer
Those papers are in regard to this suit that is already entered
against you Of course it would be cheaper for you to settle
the case out of court but you will probably want to fight us
Most women do

At this point Janice got to her feet and ran out of the room
She rushed in to where her father was writing on a lapboard
across the arms of his chair

Meanwhile Mrs Carringford and Amy were clinging together and
facing the dapper voluble little lawyer in the kitchen Amy
was sobbing excitedly but her mother said firmly

Abel Strout is at the root of this

I assure you said the lawyer politely my client is Mrs
Blayne I have nothing to do with Abel Strout

He is at the root of it nevertheless said Mrs Carringford
confidently I saw it in his eye when he was last in my house
He means to turn me and my children out and ruin us



CHAPTER XXVI THE CLOUDS LOWER

Janice was so excited she could scarcely speak intelligibly for a
minute But finally she made her father understand what was
going on in the kitchen

And hes come to take their house right away from them
concluded the girl Hes given her a paper and shes got to
give him the houseand everything

Oh no not so bad as all that said daddy soothingly
Things arent done in just that way not even by shyster
lawyers This is just a notice of suit he has given her But
you run Janice and tell them to come in here I will hear what
this man has to say

So Janice ran back to the kitchen She held the door open and
with rather a commanding air for so young a girl looking
straight at the curlyhaired man

You and Mrs Carringford come into the living room My father
wants to see you

Hey said the man Who is this

Mr Broxton Day said Mrs Carringford quietly I think we
had better see Mr Day before we go any farther in this matter

Oh I have no interest in seeing anybody else maam said the
lawyer hastily Of course you can take advice if you wish to
Every move you make however will cost you money as youll
find It will be throwing good money after bad money I assure
you

Now if you feel like settling the matter out of court

We will go in and you can say all that before Mr Day said
Mrs Carringford firmly It seems to me I shall understand it
better in front of him

Daddy is waiting for you said Janice urgently He has a
broken leg so he cant come here to get you she added looking
at the lawyer significantly

Maybe the fact of this assurancethat Broxton Day was
practically helpless physicallyled the lawyer to take a chance
in the living room But he was manifestly very ill at ease from
the moment he heard Mr Days name mentioned

Will you oblige me with your name sir said daddy in his
evercourteous way

The curlyhaired man fumbled for a card and finally handed one to
Mr Day

Mr Jonas Schrimpe repeated daddy Are you practising at
the bar here in Greensboro My office is in Napsburg Mr Day
Three Fortytwo Main Street

Ah Are you acquainted with Mr Abel Strout

I have nothing to do with Mr Strout said the man rather
sharply I have already told the lady that My client is Mrs
Blayne

I understand said Mr Day suavely I merely asked you a
question Mr Schrimpe Do you know Mr Strout

WellI know him by sight

Naturally As I chance to remember his office is in the same
building on Main Street as your own I remember the number
said Mr Day smiling Three Hundred and Fortytwo Main Street

Mr Schrimpe fidgeted and turned very red in the face Mr Day
went on quietly

Is this client of yours in Napsburg

She lives in Croydon Michigan

In Michigan How came she to pick out you Mr Schrimpe for an
attorney in this matter Forgive the question I am curious

WhyII was recommended to her

Ah By a friend I suppose

Sheshe heard of me down here and wanted to put the case in a
lawyers hands on the spot

On the spot repeated Mr Day Why not in some lawyers
hands in Greensboro rather than Napsburg

Mr Schrimpe seemed very confused as well as angry but he did
not dare to assert himself Mr Day held out his hand for the
paper the lawyer had given to Mrs Carringford

Just leave it to me Mrs Carringford he said confidently I
know just what to do Possibly had I not broken my leg I would
have been able to warn you of this

Then that Abel Strout is at the root of it just as I said she
cried

Not a doubt of it replied Mr Day That John Jamison was but
a dummy

I assure you began the redfaced lawyer but Mr Day
interrupted

Your assurances would not be accepted before this court I am
afraid Mrah Schrimpe Now would you mind as you are in
town calling upon Mrs Carringfords legal adviser in regard to
this affair

Ioh

Oh Mr Day interjected Mrs Carringford a lawyers services
cost so much

This man is my own lawyer said Mr Day promptly I assure
you that he will look into this suit without charging you much
Mrs Carringford If Mr Schrimpe

Oh if its not out of my way as I go back to the railroad
station growled the curly haired man

Not at all It is over the bankthe Farmers and Merchants
Bank Mr Randolph E Payne is the gentleman
Great Scott gasped Mr Schrimpe actually appearing to
shrivel Mr Payne

Yes He is known to you

Everybody knows Mr Payne

He is well known As good a lawyer I believe as we have in
this part of the State You do not mind meeting him

Erwill he see me Mr Day

I will telephone to him at once I assure you he will give you
a hearingand thank you Good day Mr Schrimpe

Although daddy could not leave his chair Janice saw that he had
a way of getting rid of visitors promptly when he wanted them to
go Mr Schrimpe scuttled out in a hurry

Wheel me to the telephone Janice said Mr Day cheerfully I
hope Payne frightens that little shrimp out of a years growth
If ever I saw a shyster lawyer I saw one when that fellow came
into the room

Oh Mr Day but this suit That summons What shall I do

Do nothing yet assure you Mrs Carringford you will have one
of the best lawyers in the State to tell you what to do when the
times comes Of course if the matter comes to court you will
have to go into court and meet them But dont worry till that
time comes That is my advice

Then they cant take our home away from us cried Amy
joyfully

Hold on advised Daddy I do not say that I dont wish to
encourage you with any false hopesnor to discourage you
either I know nothingabsolutely nothingregarding the legal
status of this case I have my suspicions that Abel Strout is
behind it

Oh I am sure of that cried Mrs Carringford

Nevertheless it may be that there is an unsatisfied claimant of
the old Peter Warburton Blayne property This Mrs Alice G
Blayne may be perfectly honest in her contention

But in that case wont Mr Strout or Mr Jamison give me my
money back asked Mrs Carringford

If there was much chance of that do you think Strout would have
stirred up any such suit as this asked Mr Day quietly No
Strout at least thinks he sees his way to making you lose the
house Jamison was his dummyused by him in order to keep
himself out of trouble

Oh Mr Day Dont say that

I say he thinks he has a chance But he may be mistaken
Strout is sly This may be merely strike suit started in the
hope of scaring you into making a disastrous settlement with him
He wants to get the property back The foundations for that
factory are already being laid Property values Mullen Lane are
going up

Oh dear me sighed Mrs Carringford starting back toward the
kitchen this is a wicked world

Nothing the matter with the world said Mr Day cheerfully
Its some of the folks in it

He called Mr Randolph E Paynes office then and talked to the
successful lawyer for some time To Janice afterward he would
say nothing more encouraging than he had said to the widow

When one mixes up with a sharper like Abel Strout one is likely
to be burned before he is through Strout is always and forever
trying little nasty legal tricks And Schrimpe is an instrument
fitted to Strouts hand

Perhaps they have found some ignorant woman who really was a
relative of Peter Blayne and who may have a small claim on the
property It is enough to invalidate the deed Mrs Carringford
has and yet she will be unable to prove that Strout and his man
Jamison knew about the fault in the title

If he makes her sue to recover the thousand dollars she paid the
legal fees will eat up that sumand he can afford to hire
lawyers and dribble along through the courts better than she
can

Oh Daddy

Yes I am afraid if Stroutor rather Schrimpe has a good
case it will be better to settle it out of court

But dear Daddy Mrs Carringford has no money to pay lawyers
fees or settle cases urged Janice

True And that is the unfortunate part of it Let us wait and
see what Mr Payne advises after he has looked into the matter
Whatever he says she would better do

This ended the matter for the time being But all the dark
clouds of trouble seemed to have lowered upon the Carringfords
again Janice Day was sorry for them but this was a case in
which she positively could not do something to help She could
only offer her sympathy



CHAPTER XXVII  INFORMATION THAT IS TOO LATE

During the days immediately succeeding the fire and the
Carringfords poignant trouble Janice Day had a mental problem
to solve which occupied her thoughts a good part of the time

Daddys broken leg was getting along nicely With the aid of
crutches he could get around very well indeed He had even gone
down to the bank in an automobile

So Janice did not have to give him quite the close care and
attention that she previously had Daddy declared she was making
a mollycoddle of him anywaythat she babied him too much

She had more freedom of action therefore and now she proceeded
to put a certain plan she had made into effect Janice had not
forgotten what Bertha Warring had said regarding the information
Stella Latham had hidden from her Janice at the time school
closed

Could it be that after all was said and done the Olga who had
broken Mrs Lathams dish was the same Olga that had run away
with the Days treasurebox Was it Olga Cedarstrom with her
name changed and Stella had known it to be so all the time

Really when Janice thought of this she felt exceedingly angry
with Stella She had intended after Stella had acted so meanly
toward Amy Carringford to let the farmers daughter strictly
alone in the future She would have as little to do with her as
it was possible considering that she had to go to school with
her That was at first Then her anger had cooled Now it was
aflame again

But if Stella knew positively that the Swedish girl who had
visited Mrs Johnson had been married and therefore her name was
no longer Cedarstrom Janice was determined to find it out
Unpleasant as might be to ask Stella Janice would do just this

She knew Stella had returned from her visit to the lake shore
resort Janice had seen her flying past in the Latham car more
than once within the week Janice could not stop her at such
times she could not expect Stella to put herself out at all to
give her any information So she set forth one August morning to
trudge through the heat and dust out to the Latham farm There
was no interurban car that would take her near there and how she
did wish daddy could afford an automobile

Indeed just as she turned up the road leading to the door of the
Latham house a motorcar turned too into the road powdering
Janice with dust The latter saw the malicious smile of Stella
Latham driving the car herself as the farmers daughter looked
back over her shoulder at the pedestrian

Janice kept grimly on nor would she show Stella that she was
hurt or ruffled in temper Stella waited on the porch for her
schoolmate to approach A man came to take the car around to the
garage

Well what do you want asked Stella when Janice came within
hearing Are you begging more old clothes for that protegee of
yours Amy Carringford

I have come on my own business Stella said Janice gently
It is something that I want to know and you can tell me

Stella was smiling broadly but it was by no means a pleasant
smile She was spiteful She had found since coming back from
her summer vacation that the girls had not forgotten her behavior
toward Amy Carringford and some of them still resented it She
was nowhere near as popular as she had been and even her
fathers motorcar could not regain the friendship of many of her
schoolmates whom she wished to be chums with

Stella laid all this to that sly Janice Day She dared not so
speak of Janice before her mother for Mrs Latham liked Janice
Just now however Stellas mother was not at home and she felt
free treat Janice in any way she chose

Of course you expect me to tell you everything you want to
know Janice Day said Stella But I dont know why I should

You will tell me wont you Stella if you really know that the
Swedish girl who broke your mothers dish is the same girl who
used to work for daddy and me

Why should I

Because it is the right thing to do isnt it You do not know
what it means to us if we can find that
girl

And why should I care snapped Stella You never did anything
for me Janice Day

I think I tried toat least once her schoolmate said mildly

Nothing of the kind You did something for Amy Carringfordthe
pauper You were spoons with her then and you wanted to get her
to my party You begged an invitation for her and then dressed
her up like a freak so she could come and

That is not so Stella Janice interrupted with some spirit
But I want to talk about Olga not about Amy

Go along with your old Olga cried the other angrily I
wouldnt tell you anything about her if I knew

I shall go to Mrs Johnson again then And if Mrs Johnson is
not willing to tell me I shall come back and see your mother

Oh you will sneered Stella So you think the Johnsons will
tell you about Olgas last name do you

I will ask them

Good luck to you jeered Stella as Janice went on through the
Lathams yard You can ask anybody you like but youll get
nothing out of me I assure you

Janice made no further reply She was hurt to the quick for she
did not believe she deserved any such treatment from her
schoolmate And it did too worry Janice Day when she knew she
had an enemy

Friends are so much nicer to make than enemies was one of
daddys sayings and his little daughter always bore that fact in
mind when in contact with her schoolmates

But really one could do nothing with Stella Latham once that
subborn person had made up her mind to be mad Stella gloried
in showing all the perversity with which she was cursed so
Janice sighed and gave it up

No use I hope I wont have to ask Mrs Latham Then there will
be trouble I fear

The walk over the hill and down the lane crossing the brook
Gummy Carringford had once spoken of was a pleasant walk after
all It was not dusty and there were shade trees part of the
way By the time Janice came to the little house which her
father and she had once visited to look for Olga she was quite
cool and collected again

But as soon as she drew near to the tenant house the girl was
startled There was not a sign of life about it There were no
wagons or farm tools about the sheds or barnyard There were no
cattle in the stable nor pigs in the pen nor poultry in the
wired run

Goodness me have the Johnsons gone too cried Janice

She hurried to the little house There were no curtains at the
windows and she could see right through the empty house

Thats what Stella meant exclaimed Janice Oh the mean
mean thing To let me walk away over here without telling me
that they had gone And now she is waiting back there to laugh
at me when I return Janice Day did not like to be laughed at
any more than other people And she particularly shrank from
facing the sarcastic Stella on this occasion

At least I will make some inquiries elsewhere first she
thought and set forth along the public highway on which the
little house fronted toward another dwelling that was in sight

There were people in this house that was sure There were
children playing in the yard and a pleasantfaced woman on the
front porch sewing and keeping an eye on the children

She did put out a somewhat forbidding air when Janice turned in
at the gate but then she saw the girl had no bag or sample case
so she brightened up again

You havent anything to sell I guess the woman began even
before Janice uttered a word

Oh no answered the girl

Come up and sit down said the woman Then she added Dear
me you are only a little girl Its hot walking Will you have
a drink of water

No thank you I got a drink at the well back there and
Janice pointed at the tenant house on Mr Lathams place

Oh yes Lathams cottage

The Johnsons used to live there did they not asked the caller

Swedesyes said the woman

I was looking for them

But goodness youre not a Swede exclaimed the woman

Oh no laughed Janice But I wanted to see them about a
friend of theirsa girl who used to work for us

Oh I thought you couldnt be a foreigner said the woman
Well she added Im afraid youll have to go a long way to
find out anything from the Johnsons

You dont mean

I mean theyve left the country said the woman

Left this part of the country

They have gone back to Sweden said Janices informant nodding
over her sewing Yes They had a stroke of luck Mrs Johnson
told me herself in her broken talk Nears I could find out her
grandfather had died and left her a bit of property and she and
her family were going back to the place they came from ten years
ago to attend to it Lucky folks some of them foreigners I
dont see for the life of me why they ever leave their homes and
come over here when theyve got money and land comin to them at
home

The woman talked on even faster than Miss Peckham was wont to
talk But her volubility gave Janice a chance to recover her
selfpossession She saw quite clearly that her errand had come
to naught Even if the Lathams positively knew the missing Olga
had been named Cedarstrom before her marriage they probably did
not know where Olga now was

The people who were the more likely to know these Johnsons had
gone back to their native land Janice wondered despairingly
if Olga had gone back to Sweden too

But the girl was able to hide her trouble from this new
acquaintance The woman was glad to have her stay and talk
Rather the hostess did the talking It was evident that she got
little chance for conversation living as she did on this rather
lonely road

Janice planned what she would do however while she listened
Rather than go back and perhaps have another quarrel with Stella
she decided she would go home and tell her father what she had
found out He might write to Mrs Latham for informationif the
farmers wife had anyregarding Olga

At least it was one sure thing that such information as Janice
had obtained was much too late An ocean separated her now from
the Johnsons Olgas friends



CHAPTER XXVIII GUMMY COMES INTO HIS OWN

Janice bade her new acquaintance goodbye with some difficulty
The woman by the roadside did love to talk But when the girl
was well rested she went on

She remembered very clearly the way she and daddy had come to the
little Johnson cottage in the automobile So she knew she could
find her way back One thing she did not take into
consideration however that was that an automobile gets over
the ground a great deal faster than one can walk

An hour later past midafternoon dusty and footsore she was
still marching towards Greensboro along a very pleasant but a
very wearisome road She heard the rumble of wheels behind her
but she was too tired to turn to look

Motor car after motor car had passed her while she was trudging
along in the dust and not one driver stopped to offer her a
lift

But a friendly voice now hailed her as a horse was drawn down to
a walk It reached Janice Days ear like an angelic whisper

Dont you want to ride Miss

She wheeled about with almost a scream of joy Gummy
Carringford

Jicksy Is that you Janice gasped the boy Id never know
it youre so smothered in dust What are you doing away out
here Get indo

He offered her a hand and pulled her up to the high step into the
front of the covered wagon She almost fell to the seat

You are the best boy she gasped

Aint I They cant get along without me at my house What
under the sun are you wandering around for away out here

She told him in broken sentences and he sympathized with her
because of her disappointment

I could have told you the Johnsons had gone if youd asked me
But I did not suppose you were interested in them any more he
said

And daddy being out of the bank did not know that Mr Johnson
had withdrawn his account and sailed for Europe Oh dear me it
is so exasperating Everything about that Olga and connected
with her is so mysterious

I wonder if I couldnt find out something about her in
Pickletown suggested Gummy

Daddy has been there often I believe she said doubtfully

But not of late

Why no I suppose not Hes been tied to the house with a
glass leg cried Janice laughing a little

You know I deliver orders over there twice a week for Mr
Harriman A lot of those people cant even talk English Weve
a Swede for a clerk in the store They write down what they want
for me and he puts up the orders

But I know a lot of them to talk toespecially the boys that
work in the pickle factories Ill begin by asking them said
Gummy with eagerness for he wanted to help

That will be nice of you Gummy Janice said You never do
know when we might come across some news of her

And you say you think shes married

It may be so To Willie Sangreen At least she was going with
a man by that name when she worked for us

Dont know any Sangreens over at Pickletown said Gummy
shaking his head And of course I havent seen your Olga

That is so Gummy But if the girl at Johnsons that night was
really Olga Cedarstrom youd know her again wouldnt you

Guess I would if I saw her declared the boy No fear about
that Ill keep my eyes open Janice

With this promise he chirruped to the horse that jogged along
without paying very much attention to Gummy He knew the road
better than the boy did for he had been over it many more times

Do you suppose that lawyer that came to see my mother will cheat
us out of our home Janice asked the boy suddenly showing
where his thoughts were anchored

Not if it can be helped Gummy returned the girl
sympathetically I know daddys friend Mr Payne will do all
he can for her

He hasnt sent any word to her or anything sighed Gummy We
just dont know what to do

All you can do is to sit tight and hold on I guess Janice
said That is what daddy says he does when things look stormy
for him

But you see it means so much to us said the boy shaking his
head Jicksy And me with such a miserable old name

Why Gummy

Howd you like to be called Zerubbabelbubble or something like
that he demanded Nice enough for you Janice Thats a
fancy name But Gumswith Jicksy

Why Gummy exclaimed the girl again didnt know you hated it
so

I do I dont talk about it I know Pa gave it to me because
he thought a heap of his half brother And Uncle John Gumswith
was a nice man I guess He set my father up in business in the
first place when he was married

Oh is that so Gummy

Yes Dont kick about the old name before Momsy You see I
guess Uncle John wanted them to name a boy after him and maybe
they thought if they did so it might do me some good sometime

Oh Gummy That your uncle would give you money because you
were named after him

Yes said Gummy nodding I dont know But

And your uncles never been heard from You never saw him
even

Nor he me grinned Gummy He went off to Australia and never
wrote He was always traveling around the world Pa said and he
never did write Just walked in on his folks without announcing
he was coming A regular wanderer said Janice

And now jicksy exclaimed Gummy vigorously how Id like to
have him walk in on us now

Oh Gummy she said eagerly catching the drift of his desire
With his pockets full of money

The boy nodded vigorously You see Janice it would be worth
while being called Gumswith then sure enough

Janice could not blame Gummy Carringford feeling as he did He
really should have something to pay him for being called by such
an atrocious name And Janice herself would be glad to have rich
relative walk into the Day house and present daddywith an
automobile for instance

They came in sight of the house at Eight Hundred and Fortyfive
Knight Street just as the very kind of automobile Janice would
have loved to own was drawing up before the front doora
handsome great big touring car big enough for her to have
taken most of her friends out riding in at once

Oh who is that she cried

Man Dont know him said Gummy cheerfully as the single
occupant of the tonneau stepped out of the car and entered the
gate

He was a welldressed man of more than middle age and Janices
heart began to beat faster It did seem as though something must
be about to happen

Daddy was on the porch and she could see him greet the gentleman
without rising The stranger took a seat at Mr Days request
And if Janice had been near enough to have heard the first words
that passed between them she would have suffered a great drop in
the temperature of her excitement

Hows the leg Broxton asked the visitor

Coming on Randolph Whats the news

Well yes I have news said the lawyer nodding

I know it Or you would not have found time to get up into this
part of the town Well what can you tell Mrs Carringford

Nothing much about that Mullen Lane property I fear that she
will want to hear

Too bad too bad said Broxton Day I am sorry for her She
is a hard working womanand proud No chance of helping her

I can settle the case for five hundred dollars I cannot
connect Abel Strout with this shakedownfor that is what it is
The woman up in Michigan never heard of her greatuncles
property down here till this little Schrimpe told her But we
cant connect him with Strout Strouts skirts are clear And
this Schrimpe had a perfect legal right to drum up trade Hes
that kind of lawyer said Mr Payne with disgust

Five hundred dollarsand she will still owe Abel Strout a
thousand on the mortgage sighed Mr Day

Yes But I suppose in time the property will be worth it

Its worth it now said Mr Day That is what is the matter
with Strout But Mrs Carringford hasnt the money to spare
And at the present time nobody would put a second mortgage on the
property

I suppose the woman up in Michigan gets about twentyfivemaybe
fiftydollars out of it That would settle any quitclaim of
this character Half a dozen other heirs were bought off at the
time but she was overlooked The rest of the five hundred Mrs
Carringford can raise itwill be split between Schrimpe and his
principal

There are some mighty mean people in this world said Broxton
Day grimly

Youve said it agreed the lawyer Now maybe Id better see
Mrs Carringford I understand she is here

Yes

Do you know much about her

I know she is a fine woman They came here from Napsburg after
the husband died

Alexander Carringford wasnt he asked Mr Payne taking some
papers from his pocket

I believe so

They came originally from Cleveland

Maybe

A correspondent of mine in Cleveland has written me about a
family of Carringfords and I shouldnt be surprised if these
were the same people If they are

Whats all the mystery Payne asked Broxton Day with sudden
interest for he saw that the lawyer meant more than he had said

If this is Alexander Carringfords widow I dont know but my
news is in two pieces

Meaning

Bad news and good news Lets call the woman

At that moment Janice who had gone into the house through the
back way appeared at the open door

This is my little housekeeper Randolph said Broxton Day
smiling proudly upon his daughter Janice this is Mr Payne

The girl came forward without timidity but without boldness and
accepted the visitors hand

Is Mrs Carringford out there asked Janices father

Yes Daddy And Gummy

Gummy ejaculated the lawyer Whats that A game or
something to eat

Janices dear laughter rang out with daddys bass tones Oh
no sir she said Gummy is Gumswith Carringford

My soul ejaculated the lawyer getting up quickly from his
chair it is the right family Come inside Lets see Mrs
Carringford somewhere where we can talk without the neighbors
seeing and hearing everything

For he had noticed the bowed blinds of Miss Peckhams cottage
only a few yards from the end of the porch

Tell her to come into the living room Janice said Mr Day
rising slowly and reaching for his crutches But it was evident
that he understood the lawyers excitement no more than Janice
did

The girl ran back to the kitchen and urged Mrs Carringford to
come in And Gummy too she said Maybe he wants you It is
Mr Payne and he is daddys lawyer

Its about the home Gummy ejaculated Mrs Carringford

Oh I hope hell tell us how to beat out that Abel Strout

Maybe its to say that Mr Strout can take our home faltered
Mrs Carringford

Come on Momsy said her big boy Im not afraid If worse
comes to worst it wont be so long before I can support you and
the kids anyway

Now Janice thought that was a very nice speech and she remembered
to tell daddy about it afterward

They went into the living room and Mr Day introduced Mrs
Carringford to his companion The latter looked hard at Gummy

What is your name boy he asked rather sternly

Carringford too sir said Gummy politely

The whole of it commanded the lawyer

ErGumswith Carringford said the boy with flashing eye but
cheeks that would turn red

Indeed returned the lawyer staring oddly at Gummy You are
something of a boy I take it Then he wheeled to confront Mrs
Carringford

I am told Mr Payne said that your husband was Alexander
Carringford of Cleveland

The woman was somewhat surprised but said that that statement
was correct She could not see during the next few minutes
crossexamination what these questions had to do with that
little cottage in Mullen Lane and whether her family was to be
turned out of it or not

After even his legal suspicion was satisfied as to Mrs
Carringfords identity Mr Payne said again looking at Gummy

Did you and your husband name this boy after a certain relative
named John Gumswith Mrs Carringford

My husbands elder brother Yes sir Gumswith is named after
his Uncle John

Humph I should consider it something of a punishment if I were
the boy muttered the lawyer Then he asked

Have you heard from this relativethis John
Gumswithrecently

No sir Not for fifteen years said Mrs Carringford her
face suddenly paling

Do you know where he is

I only know that he started for Australia fifteen years ago

Sit down Mrs Carringford said Mr Day softly I assure you
this is nothing to worry about

Ishouldsaynot agreed the lawyer Quite the opposite
And the boy need not look so scared either If he can stand
that name he carries around with him

Boy exclaimed Mr Payne what would you say if somebody gave
you two thousand pounds

Erwhat sir gasped Gummy Two thousand pounds of what
Must be an elephant Thats a ton

How Mr Payne did laugh at that But neither Gummy nor Janice
saw anything funny in his speech Mrs Carringford was watching
the lawyers face and she said nothing

I mean two thousand pounds in money That is something like ten
thousand dollars How about it asked Mr Payne again

Me exploded Gummy

Yes Because your name is Gumswith Carringford Isnt it
worth it chuckled the lawyer

Gummy looked all around paling and flushing by turn Then he
grinned widely and looked at Janice

Jicksy he murmured the old name is worth something after
all isnt it




CHAPTER XXIX BUT WE LOSE

It was such a happy surprise for Mrs Carringford and for Gummy
as wellthat they were well prepared for the piece of bad news
which Mr Payne had first told to Mr Broxton Day A five
hundred dollar loss on the Mullen Lane property did not look so
big when it was understood that through Gummy the Carringfords
were going to get almost ten thousand dollars

It seemed that more than a year before Mr John Gumswith of
Melbourne Australia had died leaving a considerable fortune to
friends he had made there and with whom he had lived for more
than a dozen years But he had left a legacy too to any son
that my brother Alexander Carringford of Cleveland Ohio U S
A may have had who has been duly christened Gumswith after
me to perpetuate my family name

Of course said Mr Payne dryly nobody challenged the will
and so it was probated I should myself doubt the good sense
of a man who would fasten such an ugly name upon a boy whom he
had never seen and who never did him any harm

Mr Payne breathed Gummy when he heard this and earnestly
for ten thousand dollars Ill let anybody call me anything he
wants to Names dont break any bones

At that Mr Payne and Mr Day laughed louder than they had
before But Janice knew that Gummy was not selfish nor did he
think so much of money He was delighted that he could help his
mother in her sore need

At any rate said Mr Payne the administrator of Mr John
Gumswiths estate had his legal adviser communicate with
Cleveland lawyers and they traced the Carringford family to
Napsburg Then I was requested to find them andthey have
found me and he
 smiled

I congratulate you madam Of course the courts will allow a
proper amount to be used by you for Gumswiths support

I guess not said Gummy Im almost supporting myselfam I
not Mother The moneys for you and the children

Oh no Gumswith II cannot use your fortune cried the
mother quickly

I have not yet finished resumed the lawyer with a queer
smile The boy has been left two thousand pounds for his name
The father receives a thousand pounds payable either to him or
if he be dead to his widow So you see there will be another
five thousand dollars coming to you Mrs Carringford

At that Mrs Carringford for the first time lost control of
herself She hugged Gummy and sobbed aloud

Pretty fine boy Pretty fine boy said Mr Payne

He is that agreed daddy smiling across at Janice He put out
the fire our chimney didnt he Janice

So this made them all laugh and they were all right again There
was much to talk over before Mr Payne went besides the bad
fortune about the Mullen Lane property And Mrs Carringford and
the Days talked after Gummy had rushed out to drive back to
Harrimans store The dinner was late that night in the Day
house

Indeed Janice forgot in all the confusion and excitement to
tell her father where she had been that afternoon what she had
gone for and how sadly she had been disappointed

All this wonderful fortune for the Carringfords continued to
create so much excitement at the Day house as well as in the
little cottage in Mullen Lane that for several days Janice
scarcely thought about Olga Cedarstrom and the lost treasurebox

For out of the good luck of the Carringfords bad fortune for the
Days suddenly raised its head Mrs Carringford had a good deal
of extra work to do anyway for she had to go to the lawyers
office and to the court and interest herself in many things she
had known little about before She was fighting to save her
home

Indeed Amy declared the Carringford family did not know whether
it was on its head or its heels Only Gummy Nothing seemed to
disturb Gummy And he would not give up his place with Mr
Harriman

He keeps saying Amy told Janice laughing and sobbing
together that the ten thousand dollars is for the family He
is going to keep on working until school begins and even then
after school and on Saturdays Really Janice he is darling
brother

I believe you said Janice wistfully for of late she had begun
to realize that a household of just two people was awfully small

It became quite shocking when she suddenly understood that Mrs
Carringford must give up looking after the Day household and
attend thereafter strictly to her own family Of course Mr Day
had seen this from the first but it came as a shock to his
little daughter

Oh but Amy and Gummy and the little ones get everything
They get their money and are going to own their home and get
their mother all the time too It is fine for them Daddy but
we lose

I am afraid we do said her father nodding soberly We shall
have to go back to the mercies of the intelligence office or go
to boarding

No no cried Janice to this last Not while vacation lasts
at any rate Why Ive learned a lot from Mrs Carringford and
we can get along

You are a dear little homemaker Janice he said When you get
a few more years on your shoulders I have no doubt that we shall
have as nice a home as we once had before dear mother went away
But you cannot do everything We cannot afford two in servicea
cook and a housemaid We shall have to struggle along catch as
catch can for some time I fear

But no boardinghouse declared Janice No giving up our own
dear home Daddy

All right I am going to get down tomorrow crutches or no
crutches and I will make the rounds of the agencies

Oh dear she sighed Then suddenly for she was looking out
of the window Who do you suppose that is Daddy coming in at
the side gate Why Its a black womanawfully black And
she

Janice left off breathlessly and ran to the kitchen door A
woman of more than middle age but as said herself still mighty
spry approached the porch

Hers was not an unintelligent face Her dark eye beamed upon
Janice most kindly Her white sound teeth gleamed behind a
triumphant smile She carried a shabby bag but she dropped that
and put out both hands as she came to the door

Ma bressed baby she cried in a voice that shook with emotion
Nobodys got to tell me who you is Yous your darlin mammas
livin image Ma sweet Miss Laura back a little chile agin

The dark eyes were suddenly flooded and the tears ran down the
negro womans plump cheeks She was not wrinkled and if her
tight kinky hair was a mite gray she did not have the
appearance of an old person in any way Her voice was round and
sweet and tender

You don know me honey You kyant member Mammy Blanche But
she done hol you in her arms wen you was a mite of a baby jes
as she held you dear mamma my Miss Laura Ah was her mammy
an she growed up right under ma eye Don you understun
honey The Avions was mah white folks

When Mistah Day come cotin an merried yo mamma and kerrled
her off here to Greensboro Ah come along too An Ah nebber
would o lef you only ma crippled brudder Esek an his
crippled wife done need me to tak care ob dem

But Eseks daid An here Ah is back chileMa soul an body
ef dar ain Mistah Brocky Day on crutches

Blanche Mammy Blanche exclaimed the man with real warmth as
well as wonder in his tone Is it really you

Its mah own brack sef cried the woman as daddy came
hobbling forward to meet her just as though she were the finest
company that had ever come to the Day house

You couldnt be more welcome if you were a queen Mammy
Blanche he cried You know

He halted and his own countenance fell The old woman clung
tightly to his hand with both of hers

Ah yes Ah got yo letter long long ago Mistah Brocky It
nigh broke my heart Ma lil Miss Laura But glory and she
turned suddenly to Janice here she is ober again

I know it said Broxton Day wiping his eyes Come in and sit
down Mammy Janice does not remember you I suppose But I
remember well enough that we never had any housekeeping troubles
when Mammy Blanche was on hand

Sho not Sho not chuckled the old woman And Mammy Blanche
jest as spry now an able to do for you as she used to be

What Have you come to stay with us awhile Mammy Blanche
asked Broxton Day Your brother

Esek is daid His wifes gone back to her own people Ah aint
got nobody nor nohin of mah own in dis here worl Mistah
Brocky onless dey is under dis here roof I has come to stay
sah if you is of a min to give mah ol bones house room

Janice had been breathless But she had listened and gradually
she had begun to understand She could remember a good deal that
her dear mother had told her about Mammy Blanche And this was
she

The girl put her hand confidently into that of the black womans
She looked up at her father brightly

I take it all back Daddy she murmured I was ungrateful and
suspicious of fate wasnt I We dont lose



CHAPTER XXX WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED

It took several days for Janice to understand thoroughly just
what it meant to have Mammy Blanche in the house Of course
Mrs Carringford had been perfectly capable yet she felt that
she must ask Janice or Mr Day once in a while about things

Not Mammy Blanche She knew what to do and how to do it and
just what the white folks wanted She remembered just as
perfectly how Mr Day liked things on the table and what he was
fond of and even how he wanted his bed made as though she had
only been absent from the house a week instead of ten years

Why bress your heart honey she said to Janice Ah come into
dis here house when it was fust built Ah cleaned it wid mah own
hans Ah put up de fust curtains at de windahs Ah knowed
where everything was in dem days But Ah spec now yous had so
many nocount folks in de house fixin fo you dat Ah cant find
a bressed thing Darss dat old walnut wardrobe up in de
storoom It come from de Avion place it did Ah bet de
cobwebs aint been swep off de top o dat wardrobe since yo
poor mamma died It was too tall for Mrs Carringford or me to
reach it admitted Janice

Well Ahs gwine to give dis place one fine overhaulin come
dis fall went on Mammy Blanche Ahll fix dem cobwebs

It proved to be unnecessary for Janice to worry about the
housekeeping in any particular But she had not lost another
worry and in spite of all the wonderful things that had
happened and the interesting matters that were continually
cropping up the lost treasurebox containing the mementoes of
her mother was continually fretting her mind

The opening of school was drawing near and Janice began to take
exciting little peeps between the covers of textbooks She
loved study and daddy had been insistent this summer that she
should let lessons strictly alone

She had plenty of time to sit in the kitchen while Mammy Blanche
was at work there listening to wonderful tales of her mothers
childhood and of the doins on the Avion plantation on the
other shore of the Ohio River

All gone now chile sighed Mammy Blanche Somebody else
livin in the Avion home

But better than all Janice the homemaker learned many new and
interesting things about housekeeping Mammy Blanche had a
sleight as she called it in doing housework and Janice might
well copy her methods

Amy came often to see her of course and Gummy was at the house
almost every day with orders from the store One Saturday
morning while Janice was sweeping the porch she saw Gummy
driving toward the house almost as madly as he had the day the
chimney caught fire

Why Gummy she cried running out to meet him as he drew up
the horse at the curb what is the matter

Youd never guess shouted the boy What do you suppose I
just saw that picklegirl in Olgatown

What gasped Janice

II mean Ive seen that Pickletown in OlgaOh jicksy Do
you know what I mean Janice Day

Yes Yes she cried Youve seen Olga

Then jump right in here and Ill drive you to her said the
boy without running the risk of another lapsus linguae

Without waiting even for a hat and throwing her broom back over
the fence Janice scrambled in But when Gummy started the horse
she said to him

Dont think you are driving in a chariot race Youll kill Mr
Harrimans poor old nag Drive slower Gummy She wont get
away will she

No I think shes been living in that house some time But I
never go there for orders and I never happened to see her
before

Where is it

Away down by the canal said Gummy

Oh Then it is a long way off

Yes

What will Mr Harriman say

There are not many orders this morning And this is important
Janice

I guess it is agreed the girl her face pale but her eyes
sparkling with excitement

They did not say much after that until they came in sight of the
house by the canal Oh if it should be Olga Janice began to
tremble Should she have gone to daddy first about it

But daddy was still on crutches and was not fit to come out in
this delivery wagon that was sure

What should she say to Olga if it were she Ought she to stop
and ask a policeman to go with them to the house And yet it was
a fact that she absolutely did not know for sure whether Olga had
taken the treasurebox or not

Suddenly she uttered a little exclamation Gummy glanced ahead
too

Yes he said thats the woman Thats the one I saw that
night at Stella Lathams

Itit is Olga Cedarstrom murmured Janice Gummy drew the old
horse to a stop Janice leaped down The Swedish woman turned
and looked into Janices blazing countenance Her own dull face
lit up and she actually smiled

Vell she exclaimed iss it Janice Day I bane glad to see
you Iss your fader well

Oh Olga gasped Janice

Huh What iss it the matter

We have looked everywhere for you

For me Why for me I dont vork no more I keep house for my
hoosban and Olga smiled broadly

Youyou are married to Mr Sangreen asked Janice doubtfully

I bane married right avay when I left you We go to his
folksdey leev up in Michigan He try vork dere and I coom back
on a veesit to Yon Yonsons wife He vork for Misder Latham

Yes I know cried Janice anxiously

Now Willie bane coom back to his old yob at de pickle vorks
And how is you You look fine

Oh Olga we have been dreadfully worried When when you went
away from our house did you see a little boxlike a jewel box
I left it on your trunk in the storeroom

On my troonk repeated the woman Where it stood in de
storeroom

Oh yes cried Janice clasping her hands

It had suddenly impressed her that beyond any doubt Olga was not
a thief Whatever had happened to the treasurebox Olga did not
knowingly have it in her possession
I remember de leetle box Yes You tink I take it

We havent been able to find it since you left Olga cried
Janice

Huh I saw it ButHere This boy will drive us back mit him
to your house

Oh yes Olga cried Janice with a glance at Gummy who
nodded

Ill go mit you said the woman and immediately she climbed to
the high seat Janice followed her Gummy turned the horse
about and away they went on the return journey

On the way Janice thought it best to say nothing more about the
lost treasurebox but she told Olga of how she had tried to
trace her through the Johnsons

My bad look cried Olga I break a dish by that Latham
womans house and she vant me to pay for it Huh People ought
not to use such spensive dishes Me I use common chinnyware in
my house

When they arrived at the house on Knight Street Olga jumped
briskly down and followed Janice inside Gummy called after them
that he would wait He was so excited and interested himself
that he could not leave until the mystery was cleared up

Ve go oop to dot storeroom declared Olga and proceeded to do
so with Janice trembling and hoping beside her

Once in the room the woman seized a strong chair climbed upon
it and being tall herself she could reach over the carved
strip of woodwork on the front of the wardrobe to the space that
lay behind In a moment she brought something forth covered with
dust and cobwebs that caused Janice to utter a shriek of delight
That iss it yes said Olga I be mad mit you dot morning I
leaf here The box was on my troonk and when Willie come up the
stairs for it I grab de box and pitch it up hyar I dont know
you vant it Janice and your fader

Well sighed Broxton Day when he heard the good news and had
the treasurebox in his hands Alls well that ends well But
what a peck of trouble that Swedish girl made us

No no I exclaimed Janice warmly I did it It was my fault
I was the careless one or the box would not have been where she
could see it But I am awfully glad Daddy that Olga proved not
to be a thief

Daddy showed her the tiny spring in the bottom of the box which
when released enabled him to lift up the thin partition He
removed the thin packet of letters and put them in a leather
case placing the case into the wall safe

I know where they are now my dear Do what you will with the
other keepsakes and the treasurebox itself I cannot tell you
how glad I am to get these letters back

But Janice thought she did know something about that

That Mexican mine business is not likely to cause us any more
trouble until spring anyway said daddy one night at dinner

Oh Daddy then wont you have to go down there Janice cried

Not likely Fact is there is a big fight on in the mining
country and the mines have got to shut down But the government
promises us that we shall be able to open up again next spring
We might as well sit tight and hold on as I tell them Im
sorry that so much of our funds are tied up in the business
however Politics below the Rio Grande are mighty onsartain as
Brother Jase would say

Now that Mammy Blanche is here with us I would not have to go
to Poketown even if you did go to Mexico Daddy Would I

Mmm Well thats hard telling he replied with twinkling
eyes Lets not cross that bridge till we come to it

So Janice saw nothing but a cheerful vista before her with
school coming soon pleasure in study plenty of fun between
times and such a fortunate state of affairs at Eight Hundred and
Fortyfive Knight Street that she did not have to worry about
daddys comfort or her own at all

Mrs Carringford had had no easy time of it with the shyster
lawyer and the others who were making trouble for her over her
property But in the end her own lawyer triumphed and then the
mortgage on the place was cleared off much to the satisfaction
of both the Carringfords and the Days

It does seem said Janice with an ecstatic sigh to Amy
Carringford one day when both girls had their sewing on the
porch that everything always does turn out for the best for us
Days

Humph returned Amy threading her needle I guess they
wouldnt turn out so right if you and your father didnt do
something to turn em out

And perhaps that was so too
