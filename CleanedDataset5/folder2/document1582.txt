HISTORY


This three volume etext set comes from multiple editions of Challoners
revised DouayRheims Version of the Holy Bible The division of the Old
Testaments into two parts follows the two tome format of the 16091610
printing of the Old Testament In 1568 English exiles many from
Oxford established the English College of Douay DouaiDoway Flanders
under William later Cardinal Allen In October 1578 Gregory Martin
began the work of preparing an English translation of the Bible for
Catholic readers the first such translation into Modern English
Assisting were William Allen Richard Bristow Thomas Worthington and
William Reynolds who revised criticized and corrected Dr Martins
work The college published the New Testament at Rheims ReimsRhemes
France in 1582 through John Fogny with a preface and explanatory notes
authored chiefly by Bristol Allen and Worthington Later the Old
Testament was published at Douay in two parts 1609 and 1610 by Laurence
Kellam through the efforts of Dr Worthington then superior of the
seminary The translation had been prepared before the appearance of the
New Testament but the publication was delayed due to financial
difficulties The religious and scholarly adherence to the Latin Vulgate
text led to the less elegant and idiomatic words and phrases often found
in the translation In some instances where no English word conveyed the
full meaning of the Latin a Latin word was Anglicized and its meaning
defined in a glossary Although ridiculed by critics many of these
words later found common usage in the English language Spellings of
proper names and the numbering of the Psalms are adopted from the Latin
Vulgate

In 1749 Dr Richard Challoner began a major revision of the Douay and
Rheims texts the spellings and phrasing of which had become increasingly
archaic in the almost two centuries since the translations were first
produced He modernized the diction and introduced a more fluid style
while faithfully maintaining the accuracy of Dr Martins texts This
revision became the de facto standard text for English speaking
Catholics until the twentieth century It is still highly regarded by
many for its style although it is now rarely used for liturgical
purposes The notes included in this electronic edition are generally
attributed to Bishop Challoner

The 1610 printing of the second tome of the Old Testament includes an
appendix containing the noncanonical books Prayer of Manasses Third
Booke of Esdras and Fourth Booke of Esdras While not part of
Challoners revision the 1610 texts are placed in the appendices of
Vol II of this etext set Also included are the original texts of two
short books The Prophecie of Abdias Vol II and The Catholike
Epistle of Iude the Apostle Vol III to give the reader a sense of
the language of the first editions in comparison to the Challoner
revision Further background on the DouayRheims version may be found in
a selection from the preface to the 1582 edition and the original
glossary included in the appendices of Vol III

THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO SAINT MATTHEW



Saint Matthew one of the twelve Apostles who from being a publican
that is a taxgatherer was called by our Saviour to the Apostleship
in that profession his name is Levi Luke 527 and Mark 214 He was
the first of the Evangelists that wrote the Gospel and that in Hebrew
or SyroChaldaic which the Jews in Palestine spoke at that time The
original is not now extant but it was translated in the time of the
Apostles into Greek that version was of equal authority He wrote
about six years after the Lords Ascension



Matthew Chapter 1


The genealogy of Christ he is conceived and born of a virgin

11 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the
son of Abraham

12 Abraham begot Isaac And Isaac begot Jacob And Jacob begot Judas
and his brethren

13 And Judas begot Phares and Zara of Thamar And Phares begot Esron
And Esron begot Aram

14 And Aram begot Aminadab And Aminadab begot Naasson And Naasson
begot Salmon

15 And Salmon begot Booz of Rahab And Booz begot Obed of Ruth And
Obed begot Jesse

16 And Jesse begot David the king And David the king begot Solomon
of her that had been the wife of Urias

17 And Solomon begot Roboam And Roboam begot Abia And Abia begot
Asa

18 And Asa begot Josaphat And Josaphat begot Joram And Joram begot
Ozias

19 And Ozias begot Joatham And Joatham begot Achaz And Achaz begot
Ezechias

110 And Ezechias begot Manasses And Manasses begot Amon And Amon
begot Josias

111 And Josias begot Jechonias and his brethren in the transmigration
of Babylon

112 And after the transmigration of Babylon Jechonias begot
Salathiel And Salathiel begot Zorobabel

113 And Zorobabel begot Abiud And Abiud begot Eliacim And Eliacim
begot Azor

114 And Azor begot Sadoc And Sadoc begot Achim And Achim begot
Eliud

115 And Eliud begot Eleazar And Eleazar begot Mathan And Mathan
begot Jacob

116 And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary of whom was born
Jesus who is called Christ

The husband of Mary  The Evangelist gives us rather the pedigree of
St Joseph than that of the blessed Virgin to conform to the custom
of the Hebrews who in their genealogies took no notice of women but
as they were near akin the pedigree of the one sheweth that of the
other

117 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen
generations And from David to the transmigration of Babylon are
fourteen generations and from the transmigration of Babylon to Christ
are fourteen generations

118 Now the generation of Christ was in this wise When as his mother
Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found
with child of the Holy Ghost

119 Whereupon Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing
publicly to expose her was minded to put her away privately

120 But while he thought on these things behold the Angel of the
Lord appeared to him in his sleep saying Joseph son of David fear
not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in
her is of the Holy Ghost

121 And she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name
Jesus For he shall save his people from their sins

122 Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which the Lord
spoke by the prophet saying

123 Behold a virgin shall be with child and bring forth a son and
they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God with
us

124 And Joseph rising up from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had
commanded him and took unto him his wife

125 And he knew her not till she brought forth her first born son
and he called his name Jesus

Till she brought forth her firstborn son  From these words Helvidius
and other heretics most impiously inferred that the blessed Virgin Mary
had other children besides Christ but St Jerome shews by divers
examples that this expression of the Evangelist was a manner of
speaking usual among the Hebrews to denote by the word until only
what is done without any regard to the future Thus it is said
Genesis 8 6 and 7 that Noe sent forth a raven which went forth and
did not return till the waters were dried up on the earth That is did
not return any more Also Isaias 46 4 God says I am till you grow
old Who dare infer that God should then cease to be Also in the first
book of Machabees 5 54 And they went up to mount Sion with joy and
gladness and offered holocausts because not one of them was slain
till they had returned in peace That is not one was slain before or
after they had returned God saith to his divine Son Sit on my right
hand till I make thy enemies thy footstool Shall he sit no longer
after his enemies are subdued Yea and for all eternity St Jerome
also proves by Scripture examples that an only begotten son was also
called firstborn or first begotten because according to the law the
firstborn males were to be consecrated to God Sanctify unto me saith
the Lord every firstborn that openeth the womb among the children of
Israel etc Ex 13 2



Matthew Chapter 2


The offerings of the wise men the flight into Egypt the massacre of
the Innocents

21 When Jesus therefore was born in Bethlehem of Juda in the days of
king Herod behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem

22 Saying Where is he that is born king of the Jews For we have
seen his star in the East and are come to adore him

23 And king Herod hearing this was troubled and all Jerusalem with
him

24 And assembling together all the chief priests and the scribes of
the people he inquired of them where Christ should be born

25 But they said to him In Bethlehem of Juda For so it is written
by the prophet

26 And thou Bethlehem the land of Juda art not the least among the
princes of Juda for out of thee shall come forth the captain that
shall rule my people Israel

27 Then Herod privately calling the wise men learned diligently of
them the time of the star which appeared to them

28 And sending them into Bethlehem said Go and diligently inquire
after the child and when you have found him bring me word again that
I also may come and adore him

29 Who having heard the king went their way and behold the star
which they had seen in the East went before them until it came and
stood over where the child was

210 And seeing the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy

211 And entering into the house they found the child with Mary his
mother and falling down they adored him and opening their treasures
they offered him gifts gold frankincense and myrrh

212 And having received an answer in sleep that they should not
return to Herod they went back another way into their country

213 And after they were departed behold an angel of the Lord
appeared in sleep to Joseph saying Arise and take the child and his
mother and fly into Egypt and be there until I shall tell thee For
it will come to pass that Herod will seek the child to destroy him

214 Who arose and took the child and his mother by night and
retired into Egypt and he was there until the death of Herod

215 That it might be fulfilled which the Lord spoke by the prophet
saying Out of Egypt have I called my son

216 Then Herod perceiving that he was deluded by the wise men was
exceeding angry and sending killed all the menchildren that were in
Bethlehem and in all the borders thereof from two years old and
under according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the
wise men

217 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet
saying

218 A voice in Rama was heard lamentation and great mourning Rachel
bewailing her children and would not be comforted because they are
not

219 But when Herod was dead behold an angel of the Lord appeared in
sleep to Joseph in Egypt

220 Saying Arise and take the child and his mother and go into the
land of Israel For they are dead that sought the life of the child

221 Who arose and took the child and his mother and came into the
land of Israel

222 But hearing that Archclaus reigned in Judea in the room of Herod
his father he was afraid to go thither and being warned in sleep
retired into the quarters of Galilee

223 And coming he dwelt in a city called Nazareth that it might be
fulfilled which was said by the prophets That he shall be called a
Nazarene



Matthew Chapter 3


The preaching of John Christ is baptized

31 And in those days cometh John the Baptist preaching in the desert
of Judea

32 And saying Do penance for the kingdom of heaven is at hand

Do penance  Paenitentiam agite Which word according to the use of
the scriptures and the holy fathers does not only signify repentance
and amendment of life but also punishing past sins by fasting and
such like penitential exercises

33 For this is he that was spoken of by Isaias the prophet saying A
voice of one crying in the desert Prepare ye the way of the Lord make
straight his paths

34 And the same John had his garment of camels hair and a leathern
girdle about his loins and his meat was locusts and wild honey

35 Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea and all the country
about Jordan

36 And were baptized by him in the Jordan confessing their sins

37 And seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his
baptism he said to them Ye brood of vipers who hath shewed you to
flee from the wrath to come

Pharisees and Sadducees  These were two sects among the Jews of
which the former were for the most part notorious hypocrites the
latter a kind of freethinkers in matters of religion

38 Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of penance

39 And think not to say within yourselves We have Abraham for our
father For I tell you that God is able of these stones to raise up
children to Abraham

310 For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees Every tree
therefore that doth not yield good fruit shall be cut down and cast
into the fire

311 I indeed baptize you in water unto penance but he that shall
come after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to bear
he shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost and fire

312 Whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly cleanse his
floor and gather his wheat into the barn but the chaff he will burn
with unquenchable fire

313 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan unto John to be
baptized by him

314 But John stayed him saying I ought to be baptized by thee and
comest thou to me

315 And Jesus answering said to him Suffer it to be so now For so
it becometh us to fulfil all justice Then he suffered him

316 And Jesus being baptized forthwith came out of the water and
lo the heavens were opened to him and he saw the Spirit of God
descending as a dove and coming upon him

317 And behold a voice from heaven saying This is my beloved Son in
whom I am well pleased



Matthew Chapter 4


Christs fast of forty days He is tempted He begins to preach to
call disciples to him and to work miracles

41 Then Jesus was led by the spirit into the desert to be tempted by
the devil

42 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights afterwards he
was hungry

43 And the tempter coming said to him If thou be the Son of God
command that these stones be made bread

44 Who answered and said It is written Not in bread alone doth man
live but in every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God

45 Then the devil took him up into the holy city and set him upon
the pinnacle of the temple

46 And said to him If thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for
it is written That he hath given his angels charge over thee and in
their hands shall they bear thee up lest perhaps thou dash thy foot
against a stone

47 Jesus said to him It is written again Thou shalt not tempt the
Lord thy God

48 Again the devil took him up into a very high mountain and shewed
him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them

Shewed him etc  That is pointed out to him where each kingdom lay
and set forth in words what was most glorious and admirable in each of
them Or also set before his eyes as it were in a large map a lively
representation of all those kingdoms

49 And said to him All these will I give thee if falling down thou
wilt adore me

410 Then Jesus saith to him Begone Satan for it is written The
Lord thy God shalt thou adore and him only shalt thou serve

411 Then the devil left him and behold angels came and ministered to
him

412 And when Jesus had heard that John was delivered up he retired
into Galilee

413 And leaving the city Nazareth he came and dwelt in Capharnaum on
the sea coast in the borders of Zabulon and of Nephthalim

414 That it might be fulfilled which was said by Isaias the prophet

415 Land of Zabulon and land of Nephthalim the way of the sea beyond
the Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles

416 The people that sat in darkness hath seen great light and to
them that sat in the region of the shadow of death light is sprung up

417 From that time Jesus began to preach and to say Do penance for
the kingdom of heaven is at hand

418 And Jesus walking by the sea of Galilee saw two brethren Simon
who is called Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea
for they were fishers

419 And he saith to them Come ye after me and I will make you to be
fishers of men

420 And they immediately leaving their nets followed him

421 And going on from thence he saw other two brethren James the
son of Zebedee and John his brother in a ship with Zebedee their
father mending their nets and he called them

422 And they forthwith left their nets and father and followed him

423 And Jesus went about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues
and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of
sickness and every infirmity among the people

424 And his fame went throughout all Syria and they presented to him
all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments and
such as were possessed by devils and lunatics and those that had the
palsy and he cured them

425 And much people followed him from Galilee and from Decapolis
and from Jerusalem and from Judea and from beyond the Jordan



Matthew Chapter 5


Christs sermon upon the mount The eight beatitudes

51 And seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he
was set down his disciples came unto him

52 And opening his mouth he taught them saying

53 Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven

The poor in spirit  That is the humble and they whose spirit is not
set upon riches

54 Blessed are the meek for they shall possess the land

55 Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted

56 Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after justice for they
shall have their fill

57 Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy

58 Blessed are the clean of heart they shall see God

59 Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children
of God

510 Blessed are they that suffer persecution for justice sake for
theirs is the kingdom of heaven

511 Blessed are ye when they shall revile you and persecute you and
speak all that is evil against you untruly for my sake

512 Be glad and rejoice for your reward is very great in heaven For
so they persecuted the prophets that were before you

513 You are the salt of the earth But if the salt lose its savour
wherewith shall it be salted It is good for nothing anymore but to be
cast out and to be trodden on by men

514 You are the light of the world A city seated on a mountain
cannot be hid

515 Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but upon
a candlestick that it may shine to all that are in the house

516 So let your light shine before men that they may see your good
works and glorify your Father who is in heaven

517 Do not think that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets
I am not come to destroy but to fulfil

To fulfil  By accomplishing all the figures and prophecies and
perfecting all that was imperfect

518 For amen I say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or
one tittle shall not pass of the law till all be fulfilled

Amen  That is assuredly of a truth  This Hebrew word amen is
here retained by the example and authority of all the four Evangelists
It is used by our Lord as a strong asseveration and affirmation of the
truth

519 He therefore that shall break one of these least commandments
and shall so teach men shall be called the least in the kingdom of
heaven But he that shall do and teach he shall be called great in the
kingdom of heaven

520 For I tell you that unless your justice abound more than that of
the scribes and Pharisees you shall not enter into the kingdom of
heaven

The scribes and Pharisees  The scribes were the doctors of the law of
Moses the Pharisees were a precise set of men making profession of a
more exact observance of the law and upon that account greatly
esteemed among the people

521 You have heard that it was said to them of old Thou shalt not
kill And whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment

Shall be in danger of the judgment  That is shall deserve to be
punished by that lesser tribunal among the Jews called the Judgment
which took cognizance of such crimes

522 But I say to you that whosoever is angry with his brother shall
be in danger of the judgment And whosoever shall say to his brother
Raca shall be in danger of the council And whosoever shall say Thou
fool shall be in danger of hell fire

Raca  A word expressing great indignation or contempt Shall be in
danger of the council  That is shall deserve to be punished by the
highest court of judicature called the Council or Sanhedrim
consisting of seventytwo persons where the highest causes were tried
and judged which was at Jerusalem Thou fool  This was then looked
upon as a heinous injury when uttered with contempt spite or malice
and therefore is here so severely condemned Shall be in danger of hell
fire  literally according to the Greek shall deserve to be cast
into the Gehenna of fire Which words our Saviour made use of to
express the fire and punishments of hell

523 If therefore thou offer thy gift at the altar and there thou
remember that thy brother hath anything against thee

524 Leave there thy offering before the altar and go first to be
reconciled to thy brother and then coming thou shalt offer thy gift

525 Be at agreement with thy adversary betimes whilst thou art in
the way with him lest perhaps the adversary deliver thee to the judge
and the judge deliver thee to the officer and thou be cast into
prison

526 Amen I say to thee thou shalt not go out from thence till thou
repay the last farthing

527 You have heard that it was said to them of old Thou shalt not
commit adultery

528 But I say to you that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust
after her hath already committed adultery with her in his heart

529 And if thy right eye scandalize thee pluck it out and cast it
from thee For it is expedient for thee that one of thy members should
perish rather than thy whole body be cast into hell

Scandalize thee  That is if it be a stumblingblock or occasion of
sin to thee By which we are taught to fly the immediate occasions of
sin though they be as dear to us or as necessary as a hand or an eye

530 And if thy right hand scandalize thee cut it off and cast it
from thee for it is expedient for thee that one of thy members should
perish rather than that thy whole body go into hell

531 And it hath been said Whosoever shall put away his wife let him
give her a bill of divorce

532 But I say to you that whosoever shall put away his wife
excepting the cause of fornication maketh her to commit adultery and
he that shall marry her that is put away committeth adultery

533 Again you have heard that it was said to them of old thou shalt
not forswear thyself but thou shalt perform thy oaths to the Lord

534 But I say to you not to swear at all neither by heaven for it is
the throne of God

Not to swear at all  It is not forbid to swear in truth justice and
judgment to the honour of God or our own or neighbours just defence
but only to swear rashly or profanely in common discourse and
without necessity

535 Nor by the earth for it is his footstool nor by Jerusalem for
it is the city of the great king

536 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make
one hair white or black

537 But let your speech be yea yea no no and that which is over
and above these is of evil

538 You have heard that it hath been said An eye for an eye and a
tooth for a tooth

539 But I say to you not to resist evil but if one strike thee on
thy right cheek turn to him also the other

Not to resist evil etc  What is here commanded is a Christian
patience under injuries and affronts and to be willing even to suffer
still more rather than to indulge the desire of revenge but what is
further added does not strictly oblige according to the letter for
neither did Christ nor St Paul turn the other cheek St John 18 and
Acts 23

540 And if a man will contend with thee in judgment and take away
thy coat let go thy cloak also unto him

541 And whosoever will force thee one mile go with him other two

542 Give to him that asketh of thee and from him that would borrow
of thee turn not away

543 You have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy
neighbour and hate thy enemy

544 But I say to you Love your enemies do good to them that hate
you and pray for them that persecute and calumniate you

545 That you may be the children of your Father who is in heaven who
maketh his sun to rise upon the good and bad and raineth upon the
just and the unjust

546 For if you love them that love you what reward shall you have
do not even the publicans this

The publicans  These were the gatherers of the public taxes a set of
men odious and infamous among the Jews for their extortions and
injustice

547 And if you salute your brethren only what do you more do not
also the heathens this

548 Be you therefore perfect as also your heavenly Father is
perfect



Matthew Chapter 6


A continuation of the sermon on the mount

61 Take heed that you do not your justice before men to be seen by
them otherwise you shall not have a reward of your Father who is in
heaven

Your justice  that is works of justice viz fasting prayer and
almsdeeds which ought to be performed not out of ostentation or a
view to please men but solely to please God

62 Therefore when thou dost an almsdeed sound not a trumpet before
thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that
they may be honoured by men Amen I say to you they have received
their reward

63 But when thou dost alms let not thy left hand know what thy right
hand doth

64 That thy alms may be in secret and thy Father who seeth in secret
will repay thee

65 And when ye pray you shall not be as the hypocrites that love to
stand and pray in the synagogues and corners of the streets that they
may be seen by men Amen I say to you they have received their reward

66 But thou when thou shalt pray enter into thy chamber and having
shut the door pray to thy Father in secret and thy father who seeth
in secret will repay thee

67 And when you are praying speak not much as the heathens For
they think that in their much speaking they may be heard

68 Be not you therefore like to them for your Father knoweth what is
needful for you before you ask him

69 Thus therefore shall you pray Our Father who art in heaven
hallowed be thy name

610 Thy kingdom come Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven

611 Give us this day our supersubstantial bread

Supersubstantial bread  In St Luke the same word is rendered daily
bread It is understood of the bread of life which we receive in the
Blessed Sacrament

612 And forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors

613 And lead us not into temptation But deliver us from evil Amen

Lead us not into temptation  That is suffer us not to be overcome by
temptation

614 For if you will forgive men their offences your heavenly Father
will forgive you also your offences

615 But if you will not forgive men neither will your Father forgive
you your offences

616 And when you fast be not as the hypocrites sad For they
disfigure their faces that they may appear unto men to fast Amen I
say to you they have received their reward

617 But thou when thou fastest anoint thy head and wash thy face

618 That thou appear not to men to fast but to thy Father who is in
secret and thy Father who seeth in secret will repay thee

619 Lay not up to yourselves treasures on earth where the rust and
moth consume and where thieves break through and steal

620 But lay up to yourselves treasures in heaven where neither the
rust nor moth doth consume and where thieves do not break through nor
steal

621 For where thy treasure is there is thy heart also

622 The light of thy body is thy eye If thy eye be single thy whole
body shall be lightsome

623 But if thy eye be evil thy whole body shall be darksome If then
the light that is in thee be darkness the darkness itself how great
shall it be

624 No man can serve two masters For either he will hate the one
and love the other or he will sustain the one and despise the other
You cannot serve God and mammon

Mammon  That is riches worldly interest

625 Therefore I say to you be not solicitous for your life what you
shall eat nor for your body what you shall put on Is not the life
more than the meat and the body more than the raiment

626 Behold the birds of the air for they neither sow nor do they
reap nor gather into barns and your heavenly Father feedeth them Are
not you of much more value than they

627 And which of you by taking thought can add to his stature one
cubit

628 And for raiment why are you solicitous Consider the lilies of
the field how they grow they labour not neither do they spin

629 But I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory was
arrayed as one of these

630 And if the grass of the field which is to day and to morrow is
cast into the oven God doth so clothe how much more you O ye of
little faith

631 Be not solicitous therefore saying What shall we eat or what
shall we drink or wherewith shall we be clothed

632 For after all these things do the heathens seek For your Father
knoweth that you have need of all these things

633 Seek ye therefore first the kingdom of God and his justice and
all these things shall be added unto you

634 Be not therefore solicitous for to morrow for the morrow will be
solicitous for itself Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof



Matthew Chapter 7


The third part of the sermon on the mount

71 Judge not that you may not be judged

72 For with what judgment you judge you shall be judged and with
what measure you mete it shall be measured to you again

73 And why seest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye and
seest not the beam that is in thy own eye

74 Or how sayest thou to thy brother Let me cast the mote out of thy
eye and behold a beam is in thy own eye

75 Thou hypocrite cast out first the beam out of thy own eye and
then shalt thou see to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye

76 Give not that which is holy to dogs neither cast ye your pearls
before swine lest perhaps they trample them under their feet and
turning upon you they tear you

77 Ask and it shall be given you seek and you shall find knock
and it shall be opened to you

78 For every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh
findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened

79 Or what man is there among you of whom if his son shall ask
bread will he reach him a stone

710 Or if he shall ask him a fish will he reach him a serpent

711 If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your
children how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good
things to them that ask him

712 All things therefore whatsoever you would that men should do to
you do you also to them For this is the law and the prophets

713 Enter ye in at the narrow gate for wide is the gate and broad
is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there are who go in
thereat

714 How narrow is the gate and strait is the way that leadeth to
life and few there are that find it

715 Beware of false prophets who come to you in the clothing of
sheep but inwardly they are ravening wolves

716 By their fruits you shall know them Do men gather grapes of
thorns or figs of thistles

717 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit and the evil
tree bringeth forth evil fruit

718 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can an evil
tree bring forth good fruit

719 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be cut down
and shall be cast into the fire

720 Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them

721 Not every one that saith to me Lord Lord shall enter into the
kingdom of heaven but he that doth the will of my Father who is in
heaven he shall enter into the kingdom of heaven

722 Many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have not we
prophesied in thy name and cast out devils in thy name and done many
miracles in thy name

723 And then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from
me you that work iniquity

724 Every one therefore that heareth these my words and doth them
shall be likened to a wise man that built his house upon a rock

725 And the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and
they beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded on a
rock

726 And every one that heareth these my words and doth them not
shall be like a foolish man that built his house upon the sand

727 And the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and
they beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall thereof

728 And it came to pass when Jesus had fully ended these words the
people were in admiration at his doctrine

729 For he was teaching them as one having power and not as the
scribes and Pharisees



Matthew Chapter 8


Christ cleanses the leper heals the centurions servant Peters
motherinlaw and many others he stills the storm at sea drives the
devils out of two men possessed and suffers them to go into the swine

81 And when he was come down from the mountain great multitudes
followed him

82 And behold a leper came and adored him saying Lord if thou
wilt thou canst make me clean

83 And Jesus stretching forth his hand touched him saying I will
be thou made clean And forthwith his leprosy was cleansed

84 And Jesus saith to him See thou tell no man but go shew thyself
to the priest and offer the gift which Moses commanded for a
testimony unto them

85 And when he had entered into Capharnaum there came to him a
centurion beseeching him

86 And saying Lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy and
is grievously tormented

87 And Jesus saith to him I will come and heal him

88 And the centurion making answer said Lord I am not worthy that
thou shouldst enter under my roof but only say the word and my
servant shall be healed

89 For I also am a man subject to authority having under me
soldiers and I say to this Go and he goeth and to another Come and
he cometh and to my servant Do this and he doeth it

810 And Jesus hearing this marvelled and said to them that followed
him Amen I say to you I have not found so great faith in Israel

811 And I say to you that many shall come from the east and the west
and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of
heaven

812 But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into the
exterior darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth

813 And Jesus said to the centurion Go and as thou hast believed
so be it done to thee And the servant was healed at the same hour

814 And when Jesus was come into Peters house he saw his wifes
mother lying and sick of a fever

815 And he touched her hand and the fever left her and she arose
and ministered to them

816 And when evening was come they brought to him many that were
possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and
all that were sick he healed

817 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet
Isaias saying He took our infirmities and bore our diseases

818 And Jesus seeing great multitudes about him gave orders to pass
over the water

819 And a certain scribe came and said to him Master I will follow
thee whithersoever thou shalt go

820 And Jesus saith to him The foxes have holes and the birds of
the air nests but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head

821 And another of his disciples said to him Lord suffer me first
to go and bury my father

822 But Jesus said to him Follow me and let the dead bury their
dead

823 And when he entered into the boat his disciples followed him

824 And behold a great tempest arose in the sea so that the boat was
covered with waves but he was asleep

825 And they came to him and awaked him saying Lord save us we
perish

826 And Jesus saith to them Why are you fearful O ye of little
faith Then rising up he commanded the winds and the sea and there
came a great calm

827 But the men wondered saying What manner of man is this for the
winds and the sea obey him

828 And when he was come on the other side of the water into the
country of the Gerasens there met him two that were possessed with
devils coming out of the sepulchres exceeding fierce so that none
could pass by that way

829 And behold they cried out saying What have we to do with thee
Jesus Son of God art thou come hither to torment us before the time

830 And there was not far from them a herd of many swine feeding

831 And the devils besought him saying If thou cast us out hence
send us into the herd of swine

832 And he said to them Go But they going out went into the swine
and behold the whole herd ran violently down a steep place into the
sea and they perished in the waters

833 And they that kept them fled and coming into the city told
every thing and concerning them that had been possessed by the devils

834 And behold the whole city went out to meet Jesus and when they
saw him they besought him that he would depart from their coast



Matthew Chapter 9


Christ heals one sick of palsy calls Matthew cures the issue of
blood raises to life the daughter of Jairus gives sight to two blind
men and heals a dumb man possessed by the devil

91 And entering into a boat he passed over the water and came into
his own city

92 And behold they brought to him one sick of the palsy lying in a
bed And Jesus seeing their faith said to the man sick of the palsy
Be of good heart son thy sins are forgiven thee

93 And behold some of the scribes said within themselves He
blasphemeth

94 And Jesus seeing their thoughts said Why do you think evil in
your hearts

95 Whether is easier to say Thy sins are forgiven thee or to say
Arise and walk

96 But that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to
forgive sins then said he to the man sick of the palsy Arise take
up thy bed and go into thy house

97 And he arose and went into his house

98 And the multitude seeing it feared and glorified God that gave
such power to men

99 And when Jesus passed on from thence he saw a man sitting in the
custom house named Matthew and he saith to him Follow me And he
arose up and followed him

910 And it came to pass as he was sitting at meat in the house
behold many publicans and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his
disciples

911 And the Pharisees seeing it said to his disciples Why doth your
master eat with publicans and sinners

912 But Jesus hearing it said They that are in health need not a
physician but they that are ill

913 Go then and learn what this meaneth I will have mercy and not
sacrifice For I am not come to call the just but sinners

914 Then came to him the disciples of John saying Why do we and the
Pharisees fast often but thy disciples do not fast

915 And Jesus said to them Can the children of the bridegroom mourn
as long as the bridegroom is with them But the days will come when
the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then they shall fast

Can the children of the bridegroom  This by a Hebraism signifies
the friends or companions of the bridegroom

916 And nobody putteth a piece of raw cloth unto an old garment For
it taketh away the fulness thereof from the garment and there is made
a greater rent

917 Neither do they put new wine into old bottles Otherwise the
bottles break and the wine runneth out and the bottles perish But
new wine they put into new bottles and both are preserved

918 As he was speaking these things unto them behold a certain ruler
came up and adored him saying Lord my daughter is even now dead
but come lay thy hand upon her and she shall live

919 And Jesus rising up followed him with his disciples

920 And behold a woman who was troubled with an issue of blood twelve
years came behind him and touched the hem of his garment

921 For she said within herself If I shall touch only his garment I
shall be healed

922 But Jesus turning and seeing her said Be of good heart
daughter thy faith hath made thee whole And the woman was made whole
from that hour

923 And when Jesus was come into the house of the ruler and saw the
minstrels and the multitude making a rout

924 He said Give place for the girl is not dead but sleepeth And
they laughed him to scorn

925 And when the multitude was put forth he went in and took her by
the hand And the maid arose

926 And the fame hereof went abroad into all that country

927 And as Jesus passed from thence there followed him two blind men
crying out and saying Have mercy on us O Son of David

928 And when he was come to the house the blind men came to him And
Jesus saith to them Do you believe that I can do this unto you They
say to him Yea Lord

929 Then he touched their eyes saying According to your faith be
it done unto you

930 And their eyes were opened and Jesus strictly charged them
saying See that no man know this

931 But they going out spread his fame abroad in all that country

932 And when they were gone out behold they brought him a dumb man
possessed with a devil

933 And after the devil was cast out the dumb man spoke and the
multitudes wondered saying Never was the like seen in Israel

934 But the Pharisees said By the prince of devils he casteth out
devils

935 And Jesus went about all the cities and towns teaching in their
synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every
disease and every infirmity

936 And seeing the multitudes he had compassion on them because
they were distressed and lying like sheep that have no shepherd

937 Then he saith to his disciples The harvest indeed is great but
the labourers are few

938 Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that he send forth
labourers into his harvest



Matthew Chapter 10


Christ sends out his twelve apostles with the power of miracles The
lessons he gives them

101 And having called his twelve disciples together he gave them
power over unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of
diseases and all manner of infirmities

102 And the names of the twelve Apostles are these The first Simon
who is called Peter and Andrew his brother

103 James the son of Zebedee and John his brother Philip and
Bartholomew Thomas and Matthew the publican and James the son of
Alpheus and Thaddeus

104 Simon the Cananean and Judas Iscariot who also betrayed him

105 These twelve Jesus sent commanding them saying Go ye not into
the way of the Gentiles and into the city of the Samaritans enter ye
not

106 But go ye rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel

107 And going preach saying The kingdom of heaven is at hand

108 Heal the sick raise the dead cleanse the lepers cast out
devils freely have you received freely give

109 Do not possess gold nor silver nor money in your purses

1010 Nor scrip for your journey nor two coats nor shoes nor a
staff for the workman is worthy of his meat

1011 And into whatsoever city or town you shall enter inquire who in
it is worthy and there abide till you go thence

1012 And when you come into the house salute it saying Peace be to
this house

1013 And if that house be worthy your peace shall come upon it but
if it be not worthy your peace shall return to you

1014 And whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words going
forth out of that house or city shake off the dust from your feet

1015 Amen I say to you it shall be more tolerable for the land of
Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that city

1016 Behold I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves Be ye
therefore wise as serpents and simple as doves

Simple  That is harmless plain sincere and without guile

1017 But beware of men For they will deliver you up in councils and
they will scourge you in their synagogues

1018 And you shall be brought before governors and before kings for
my sake for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles

1019 But when they shall deliver you up take no thought how or what
to speak for it shall be given you in that hour what to speak

1020 For it is not you that speak but the spirit of your Father that
speaketh in you

1021 The brother also shall deliver up the brother to death and the
father the son and the children shall rise up against their parents
and shall put them to death

1022 And you shall be hated by all men for my names sake but he
that shall persevere unto the end he shall be saved

1023 And when they shall persecute you in this city flee into
another Amen I say to you you shall not finish all the cities of
Israel till the Son of man come

1024 The disciple is not above the master nor the servant above his
lord

1025 It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master and the
servant as his lord If they have called the good man of the house
Beelzebub how much more them of his household

1026 Therefore fear them not For nothing is covered that shall not
be revealed nor hid that shall not be known

1027 That which I tell you in the dark speak ye in the light and
that which you hear in the ear preach ye upon the housetops

1028 And fear ye not them that kill the body and are not able to
kill the soul but rather fear him that can destroy both soul and body
in hell

1029 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and not one of them
shall fall on the ground without your Father

1030 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered

1031 Fear not therefore better are you than many sparrows

1032 Every one therefore that shall confess me before men I will
also confess him before my Father who is in heaven

1033 But he that shall deny me before men I will also deny him
before my Father who is in heaven

1034 Do not think that I came to send peace upon earth I came not to
send peace but the sword

1035 For I came to set a man at variance against his father and the
daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother
in law

I came to set a man at variance etc  Not that this was the end or
design of the coming of our Saviour but that his coming and his
doctrine would have this effect by reason of the obstinate resistance
that many would make and of their persecuting all such as should
adhere to him

1036 And a mans enemies shall be they of his own household

1037 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of
me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of
me

1038 And he that taketh not up his cross and followeth me is not
worthy of me

1039 He that findeth his life shall lose it and he that shall lose
his life for me shall find it

1040 He that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me
receiveth him that sent me

1041 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall
receive the reward of a prophet and he that receiveth a just man in
the name of a just man shall receive the reward of a just man

1042 And whosoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a
cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple amen I say to you he
shall not lose his reward



Matthew Chapter 11


John sends his disciples to Christ who upbraids the Jews for their
incredulity and calls to him such as are sensible of their burdens

111 And it came to pass when Jesus had made an end of commanding his
twelve disciples he passed from thence to teach and to preach in
their cities

112 Now when John had heard in prison the works of Christ sending
two of his disciples he said to him

113 Art thou he that art to come or look we for another

114 And Jesus making answer said to them Go and relate to John what
you have heard and seen

115 The blind see the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf
hear the dead rise again the poor have the gospel preached to them

116 And blessed is he that shall not be scandalized in me

Scandalized in me  That is who shall not take occasion of scandal or
offence from my humility and the disgraceful death of the cross which
I shall endure

117 And when they went their way Jesus began to say to the
multitudes concerning John What went you out into the desert to see a
reed shaken with the wind

118 But what went you out to see a man clothed in soft garments
Behold they that are clothed in soft garments are in the houses of
kings

119 But what went you out to see A prophet Yea I tell you and more
than a prophet

1110 For this is he of whom it is written Behold I send my angel
before my face who shall prepare thy way before thee

1111 Amen I say to you there hath not risen among them that are born
of women a greater than John the Baptist yet he that is the lesser in
the kingdom of heaven is greater than he

1112 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of
heaven suffereth violence and the violent bear it away

Suffereth violence etc  It is not to be obtained but by main force
by using violence upon ourselves by mortification and penance and
resisting our perverse inclinations

1113 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John

1114 And if you will receive it he is Elias that is to come

He is Elias etc  Not in person but in spirit St Luke 1 17

1115 He that hath ears to hear let him hear

1116 But whereunto shall I esteem this generation to be like It is
like to children sitting in the market place

1117 Who crying to their companions say We have piped to you and
you have not danced we have lamented and you have not mourned

1118 For John came neither eating nor drinking and they say He hath
a devil

1119 The Son of man came eating and drinking and they say Behold a
man that is a glutton and a wine drinker a friend of publicans and
sinners And wisdom is justified by her children

1120 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein were done the most
of his miracles for that they had not done penance

1121 Woe thee Corozain woe to thee Bethsaida for if in Tyre and
Sidon had been wrought the miracles that have been wrought in you they
had long ago done penance in sackcloth and ashes

1122 But I say unto you it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and
Sidon in the day of judgment than for you

1123 And thou Capharnaum shalt thou be exalted up to heaven thou
shalt go down even unto hell For if in Sodom had been wrought the
miracles that have been wrought in thee perhaps it had remained unto
this day

1124 But I say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the land
of Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee

1125 At that time Jesus answered and said I confess to thee O
Father Lord of Heaven and earth because thou hast hid these things
from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them to little ones

1126 Yea Father for so hath it seemed good in thy sight

1127 All things are delivered to me by my Father And no one knoweth
the Son but the Father neither doth any one know the Father but the
Son and he to whom it shall please the Son to reveal him

1128 Come to me all you that labor and are burdened and I will
refresh you

1129 Take up my yoke upon you and learn of me because I am meek
and humble of heart And you shall find rest to your souls

1130 For my yoke is sweet and my burden light



Matthew Chapter 12


Christ reproves the blindness of the Pharisees and confutes their
attributing his miracles to Satan

121 At that time Jesus went through the corn on the sabbath and his
disciples being hungry began to pluck the ears and to eat

122 And the Pharisees seeing them said to him Behold thy disciples
do that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days

123 But he said to them Have you not read what David did when he was
hungry and they that were with him

124 How he entered into the house of God and did eat the loaves of
proposition which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for them that
were with him but for the priests only

The loaves of proposition  So were called the twelve loaves which
were placed before the sanctuary in the temple of God

125 Or have ye not read in the law that on the sabbath days the
priests in the temple break the sabbath and are without blame

126 But I tell you that there is here a greater than the temple

127 And if you knew what this meaneth I will have mercy and not
sacrifice you would never have condemned the innocent

128 For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath

129 And when he had passed from thence he came into their
synagogues

1210 And behold there was a man who had a withered hand and they
asked him saying Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days that they
might accuse him

1211 But he said to them What man shall there be among you that
hath one sheep and if the same fall into a pit on the sabbath day
will he not take hold on it and lift it up

1212 How much better is a man than a sheep Therefore it is lawful to
do a good deed on the sabbath days

1213 Then he saith to the man Stretch forth thy hand and he
stretched it forth and it was restored to health even as the other

1214 And the Pharisees going out made a consultation against him how
they might destroy him

1215 But Jesus knowing it retired from thence and many followed
him and he healed them all

1216 And he charged them that they should not make him known

1217 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaias the
prophet saying

1218 Behold my servant whom I have chosen my beloved in whom my soul
hath been well pleased I will put my spirit upon him and he shall
shew judgment to the Gentiles

1219 He shall not contend nor cry out neither shall any man hear
his voice in the streets

1220 The bruised reed he shall not break and smoking flax he shall
not extinguish till he send forth judgment unto victory

1221 And in his name the Gentiles shall hope

1222 Then was offered to him one possessed with a devil blind and
dumb and he healed him so that he spoke and saw

1223 And all the multitudes were amazed and said Is not this the
son of David

1224 But the Pharisees hearing it said This man casteth not out
devils but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils

1225 And Jesus knowing their thoughts said to them Every kingdom
divided against itself shall be made desolate and every city or house
divided against itself shall not stand

1226 And if Satan cast out Satan he is divided against himself how
then shall his kingdom stand

1227 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils by whom do your children
cast them out Therefore they shall be your judges

1228 But if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils then is the
kingdom of God come upon you

1229 Or how can any one enter into the house of the strong and rifle
his goods unless he first bind the strong and then he will rifle his
house

1230 He that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not
with me scattereth

1231 Therefore I say to you Every sin and blasphemy shall be
forgiven men but the blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven

The blasphemy of the Spirit  The sin here spoken of is that
blasphemy by which the Pharisees attributed the miracles of Christ
wrought by the Spirit of God to Beelzebub the prince of devils Now
this kind of sin is usually accompanied with so much obstinacy and
such wilful opposing the Spirit of God and the known truth that men
who are guilty of it are seldom or never converted and therefore are
never forgiven because they will not repent Otherwise there is no
sin which God cannot or will not forgive to such as sincerely repent
and have recourse to the keys of the church

1232 And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man it
shall be forgiven him but he that shall speak against the Holy Ghost
it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world nor in the world to
come

Nor in the world to come  From these words St Augustine De Civ
Dei lib 21 c 13 and St Gregory Dialog 4 c 39 gather that
some sins may be remitted in the world to come and consequently that
there is a purgatory or a middle place

1233 Either make the tree good and its fruit good or make the tree
evil and its fruit evil For by the fruit the tree is known

1234 O generation of vipers how can you speak good things whereas
you are evil for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh

1235 A good man out of a good treasure bringeth forth good things
and an evil man out of an evil treasure bringeth forth evil things

1236 But I say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak
they shall render an account for it in the day of judgment

Every idle word  This shews there must be a place of temporal
punishment hereafter where these slighter faults shall be punished

1237 For by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou
shalt be condemned

1238 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him saying
Master we would see a sign from thee

A sign  That is a miracle from heaven St Luke 11 16

1239 Who answering said to them An evil and adulterous generation
seeketh a sign and a sign shall not be given it but the sign of Jonas
the prophet

1240 For as Jonas was in the whales belly three days and three
nights so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days
and three nights

Three days etc  Not complete days and nights but part of three
days and three nights taken according to the way that the Hebrews
counted their days and nights viz from evening to evening

1241 The men of Ninive shall rise in judgment with this generation
and shall condemn it because they did penance at the preaching of
Jonas And behold a greater than Jonas here

1242 The queen of the south shall rise in judgment with this
generation and shall condemn it because she came from the ends of the
earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon
here

1243 And when an unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh
through dry places seeking rest and findeth none

1244 Then he saith I will return into my house from whence I came
out And coming he findeth it empty swept and garnished

1245 Then he goeth and taketh with him seven other spirits more
wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last
state of that man is made worse than the first So shall it be also to
this wicked generation

1246 As he was yet speaking to the multitudes behold his mother and
his brethren stood without seeking to speak to him

1247 And one said unto him Behold thy mother and thy brethren stand
without seeking thee

1248 But he answering him that told him said Who is my mother and
who are my brethren

Who is my mother  This was not spoken by way of slighting his
mother but to shew that we are never to suffer ourselves to be taken
from the service of God by any inordinate affection to our earthly
parents and that which our Lord chiefly regarded in his mother was
her doing the will of his Father in heaven It may also further allude
to the reprobation of the Jews his carnal kindred and the election of
the Gentiles

1249 And stretching forth his hand towards his disciples he said
Behold my mother and my brethren

1250 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father that is in heaven
he is my brother and sister and mother



Matthew Chapter 13


The parables of the sower and the cockle of the mustardseed etc

131 The same day Jesus going out of the house sat by the sea side

132 And great multitudes were gathered together unto him so that he
went up into a boat and sat and all the multitude stood on the shore

133 And he spoke to them many things in parables saying Behold the
sower went forth to sow

134 And whilst he soweth some fell by the way side and the birds of
the air came and ate them up

135 And other some fell upon stony ground where they had not much
earth and they sprung up immediately because they had no deepness of
earth

136 And when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had
not root they withered away

137 And others fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked
them

138 And others fell upon good ground and they brought forth fruit
some an hundred fold some sixty fold and some thirty fold

139 He that hath ears to hear let him hear

1310 And his disciples came and said to him Why speakest thou to
them in parables

1311 Who answered and said to them Because to you it is given to
know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not
given

1312 For he that hath to him shall be given and he shall abound
but he that hath not from him shall be taken away that also which he
hath

1313 Therefore do I speak to them in parables because seeing they
see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand

1314 And the prophecy of Isaias is fulfilled in them who saith By
hearing you shall hear and shall not understand and seeing you shall
see and shall not perceive

1315 For the heart of this people is grown gross and with their ears
they have been dull of hearing and their eyes they have shut lest at
any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and
understand with their heart and be converted and I should heal them

1316 But blessed are your eyes because they see and your ears
because they hear

1317 For amen I say to you many prophets and just men have desired
to see the things that you see and have not seen them and to hear the
things that you hear and have not heard them

1318 Hear you therefore the parable of the sower

1319 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth
it not there cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was
sown in his heart this is he that received the seed by the way side

1320 And he that received the seed upon stony ground is he that
heareth the word and immediately receiveth it with joy

1321 Yet hath he not root in himself but is only for a time and
when there ariseth tribulation and persecution because of the word he
is presently scandalized

1322 And he that received the seed among thorns is he that heareth
the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches
choketh up the word and he becometh fruitless

1323 But he that received the seed upon good ground is he that
heareth the word and understandeth and beareth fruit and yieldeth
the one an hundredfold and another sixty and another thirty

1324 Another parable he proposed to them saying The kingdom of
heaven is likened to a man that sowed good seed in his field

1325 But while men were asleep his enemy came and oversowed cockle
among the wheat and went his way

1326 And when the blade was sprung up and had brought forth fruit
then appeared also the cockle

1327 And the servants of the good man of the house coming said to
him Sir didst thou not sow good seed in thy field Whence then hath
it cockle

1328 And he said to them An enemy hath done this And the servants
said to him Wilt thou that we go and gather it up

1329 And he said No lest perhaps gathering up the cockle you root
up the wheat also together with it

1330 Suffer both to grow until the harvest and in the time of the
harvest I will say to the reapers Gather up first the cockle and bind
it into bundles to burn but the wheat gather ye into my barn

1331 Another parable he proposed unto them saying The kingdom of
heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed
in his field

1332 Which is the least indeed of all seeds but when it is grown up
it is greater than all herbs and becometh a tree so that the birds of
the air come and dwell in the branches thereof

1333 Another parable he spoke to them The kingdom of heaven is like
to leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until
the whole was leavened

1334 All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the multitudes and
without parables he did not speak to them

1335 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet
saying I will open my mouth in parables I will utter things hidden
from the foundation of the world

1336 Then having sent away the multitudes he came into the house
and his disciples came to him saying Expound to us the parable of the
cockle of the field

1337 Who made answer and said to them He that soweth the good seed
is the Son of man

1338 And the field is the world And the good seed are the children
of the kingdom And the cockle are the children of the wicked one

1339 And the enemy that sowed them is the devil But the harvest is
the end of the world And the reapers are the angels

1340 Even as cockle therefore is gathered up and burnt with fire so
shall it be at the end of the world

1341 The Son of man shall send his angels and they shall gather out
of his kingdom all scandals and them that work iniquity

1342 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth

1343 Then shall the just shine as the sun in the kingdom of their
Father He that hath ears to hear let him hear

1344 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in a field
Which a man having found hid it and for joy thereof goeth and
selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field

1345 Again the kingdom of heaven is like to a merchant seeking good
pearls

1346 Who when he had found one pearl of great price went his way
and sold all that he had and bought it

1347 Again the kingdom of heaven is like to a net cast into the sea
and gathering together of all kinds of fishes

1348 Which when it was filled they drew out and sitting by the
shore they chose out the good into vessels but the bad they cast
forth

1349 So shall it be at the end of the world The angels shall go out
and shall separate the wicked from among the just

1350 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth

1351 Have ye understood all these things They say to him Yes

1352 He said unto them Therefore every scribe instructed in the
kingdom of heaven is like to a man that is a householder who bringeth
forth out of his treasure new things and old

1353 And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these parables he
passed from thence

1354 And coming into his own country he taught them in their
synagogues so that they wondered and said How came this man by this
wisdom and miracles

1355 Is not this the carpenters son Is not his mother called Mary
and his brethren James and Joseph and Simon and Jude

His brethren  These were the children of Mary the wife of Cleophas
sister to our Blessed Lady St Matt 27 56 St John 19 25 and
therefore according to the usual style of the Scripture they were
called brethren that is near relations to our Saviour

1356 And his sisters are they not all with us Whence therefore hath
he all these things

1357 And they were scandalized in his regard But Jesus said to them
A prophet is not without honour save in his own country and in his
own house

1358 And he wrought not many miracles there because of their
unbelief



Matthew Chapter 14


Herod puts John to death Christ feeds five thousand in the desert He
walks upon the sea and heals all the diseased with the touch of his
garment

141 At that time Herod the Tetrarch heard the fame of Jesus

Tetrarch  This word derived from the Greek signifies one that rules
over the fourth part of a kingdom as Herod then ruled over Galilee
which was but the fourth part of the kingdom of his father

142 And he said to his servants This is John the Baptist he is
risen from the dead and therefore mighty works shew forth themselves
in him

143 For Herod had apprehended John and bound him and put him into
prison because of Herodias his brothers wife

144 For John said to him It is not lawful for thee to have her

145 And having a mind to put him to death he feared the people
because they esteemed him as a prophet

146 But on Herods birthday the daughter of Herodias danced before
them and pleased Herod

147 Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she
would ask of him

148 But she being instructed before by her mother said Give me here
in a dish the head of John the Baptist

149 And the king was struck sad yet because of his oath and for
them that sat with him at table he commanded it to be given

1410 And he sent and beheaded John in the prison

1411 And his head was brought in a dish and it was given to the
damsel and she brought it to her mother

1412 And his disciples came and took the body and buried it and
came and told Jesus

1413 Which when Jesus had heard he retired from thence by a boat
into a desert place apart and the multitudes having heard of it
followed him on foot out of the cities

1414 And he coming forth saw a great multitude and had compassion on
them and healed their sick

1415 And when it was evening his disciples came to him saying This
is a desert place and the hour is now passed send away the
multitudes that going into the towns they may buy themselves
victuals

1416 But Jesus said to them They have no need to go give you them
to eat

1417 They answered him We have not here but five loaves and two
fishes

1418 Who said to them Bring them hither to me

1419 And when he had commanded the multitude to sit down upon the
grass he took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to
heaven he blessed and brake and gave the loaves to his disciples
and the disciples to the multitudes

1420 And they did all eat and were filled And they took up what
remained twelve full baskets of fragments

1421 And the number of them that did eat was five thousand men
besides women and children

1422 And forthwith Jesus obliged his disciples to go up into the
boat and to go before him over the water till he dismissed the
people

1423 And having dismissed the multitude he went into a mountain
alone to pray And when it was evening he was there alone

1424 But the boat in the midst of the sea was tossed with the waves
for the wind was contrary

1425 And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them walking
upon the sea

1426 And they seeing him walking upon the sea were troubled saying
It is an apparition And they cried out for fear

1427 And immediately Jesus spoke to them saying Be of good heart
it is I fear ye not

1428 And Peter making answer said Lord if it be thou bid me come
to thee upon the waters

1429 And he said Come And Peter going down out of the boat walked
upon the water to come to Jesus

1430 But seeing the wind strong he was afraid and when he began to
sink he cried out saying Lord save me

1431 And immediately Jesus stretching forth his hand took hold of
him and said to him O thou of little faith why didst thou doubt

1432 And when they were come up into the boat the wind ceased

1433 And they that were in the boat came and adored him saying
Indeed thou art the Son of God

1434 And having passed the water they came into the country of
Genesar

1435 And when the men of that place had knowledge of him they sent
into all that country and brought to him all that were diseased

1436 And they besought him that they might touch but the hem of his
garment And as many as touched were made whole



Matthew Chapter 15


Christ reproves the Scribes He cures the daughter of the woman of
Canaan and many others and feeds four thousand with seven loaves

151 Then came to him from Jerusalem scribes and Pharisees saying

152 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the ancients
For they wash not their hands when they eat bread

153 But he answering said to them Why do you also transgress the
commandment of God for your tradition For God said

154 Honour thy father and mother And He that shall curse father or
mother let him die the death

155 But you say Whosoever shall say to father or mother The gift
whatsoever proceedeth from me shall profit thee

The gift etc  That is the offering that I shall make to God shall
be instead of that which should be expended for thy profit This
tradition of the Pharisees was calculated to enrich themselves by
exempting children from giving any further assistance to their parents
if they once offered to the temple and the priests that which should
have been the support of their parents But this was a violation of the
law of God and of nature which our Saviour here condemns

156 And he shall not honour his father or his mother and you have
made void the commandment of God for your tradition

157 Hypocrites well hath Isaias prophesied of you saying

158 This people honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far
from me

159 And in vain do they worship me teaching doctrines and
commandments of men

Commandments of men  The doctrines and commandments here reprehended
are such as are either contrary to the law of God as that of
neglecting parents under pretence of giving to God or at least are
frivolous unprofitable and no ways conducing to true piety as that
of often washing hands etc without regard to the purity of the
heart But as to the rules and ordinances of the holy church touching
fasts festivals etc these are no ways repugnant to but highly
agreeable to Gods holy word and all Christian piety neither are they
to be counted among the doctrines and commandments of men because they
proceed not from mere human authority but from that which Christ has
established in his church whose pastors he has commanded us to hear
and obey even as himself St Luke 10 16 St Matt 18 17

1510 And having called together the multitudes unto him he said to
them Hear ye and understand

1511 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man but what
cometh out of the mouth this defileth a man

Not that which goeth into etc  No uncleanness in meat nor any dirt
contracted by eating it with unwashed hands can defile the soul but
sin alone or a disobedience of the heart to the ordinance and will of
God And thus when Adam took the forbidden fruit it was not the apple
which entered into the mouth but the disobedience to the law of God
which defiled him The same is to be said if a Jew in the time of the
old law had eaten swines flesh or a Christian convert in the days
of the apostles contrary to their ordinance had eaten blood or if
any of the faithful at present should transgress the ordinance of Gods
church by breaking the fasts for in all these cases the soul would be
defiled not indeed by that which goeth into the mouth but by the
disobedience of the heart in wilfully transgressing the ordinance of
God or of those who have their authority from him

1512 Then came his disciples and said to him Dost thou know that
the Pharisees when they heard this word were scandalized

1513 But he answering said Every plant which my heavenly Father
hath not planted shall be rooted up

1514 Let them alone they are blind and leaders of the blind And if
the blind lead the blind both fall into the pit

1515 And Peter answering said to him Expound to us this parable

1516 But he said Are you also yet without understanding

1517 Do you not understand that whatsoever entereth into the mouth
goeth into the belly and is cast out into the privy

1518 But the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from
the heart and those things defile a man

1519 For from the heart come forth evil thoughts murders
adulteries fornications thefts false testimonies blasphemies

1520 These are the things that defile a man But to eat with unwashed
hands doth not defile a man

1521 And Jesus went from thence and retired into the coast of Tyre
and Sidon

1522 And behold a woman of Canaan who came out of those coasts
crying out said to him Have mercy on me O Lord thou son of David
my daughter is grievously troubled by a devil

1523 Who answered her not a word And his disciples came and besought
him saying Send her away for she crieth after us

1524 And he answering said I was not sent but to the sheep that
are lost of the house of Israel

1525 But she came and adored him saying Lord help me

1526 Who answering said It is not good to take the bread of the
children and to cast it to the dogs

1527 But she said Yea Lord for the whelps also eat of the crumbs
that fall from the table of their masters

1528 Then Jesus answering said to her O woman great is thy faith
be it done to thee as thou wilt and her daughter was cured from that
hour

1529 And when Jesus had passed away from thence he came nigh the sea
of Galilee and going up into a mountain he sat there

1530 And there came to him great multitudes having with them the
dumb the blind the lame the maimed and many others and they cast
them down at his feet and he healed them

1531 So that the multitudes marvelled seeing the dumb speak the lame
walk the blind see and they glorified the God of Israel

1532 And Jesus called together his disciples and said I have
compassion on the multitudes because they continue with me now three
days and have not what to eat and I will not send them away fasting
lest they faint in the way

1533 And the disciples say unto him Whence then should we have so
many loaves in the desert as to fill so great a multitude

1534 And Jesus said to them How many loaves have you But they said
Seven and a few little fishes

1535 And he commanded the multitude to sit down upon the ground

1536 And taking the seven loaves and the fishes and giving thanks
he brake and gave to his disciples and the disciples gave to the
people

1537 And they did all eat and had their fill And they took up seven
baskets full of what remained of the fragments

1538 And they that did eat were four thousand men beside children
and women

1539 And having dismissed the multitude he went up into a boat and
came into the coasts of Magedan



Matthew Chapter 16


Christ refuses to shew the Pharisees a sign from heaven Peters
confession is rewarded He is rebuked for opposing Christs passion
All his followers must deny themselves

161 And there came to him the Pharisees and Sadducees tempting and
they asked him to shew them a sign from heaven

162 But he answered and said to them When it is evening you say It
will be fair weather for the sky is red

163 And in the morning To day there will be a storm for the sky is
red and lowering You know then how to discern the face of the sky and
can you not know the signs of the times

164 A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and a
sign shall not be given it but the sign of Jonas the prophet And he
left them and went away

165 And when his disciples were come over the water they had
forgotten to take bread

166 Who said to them Take heed and beware of the leaven of the
Pharisees and Sadducees

167 But they thought within themselves saying Because we have taken
no bread

168 And Jesus knowing it said Why do you think within yourselves O
ye of little faith for that you have no bread

169 Do you not yet understand neither do you remember the five
loaves among five thousand men and how many baskets you took up

1610 Nor the seven loaves among four thousand men and how many
baskets you took up

1611 Why do you not understand that it was not concerning bread I
said to you Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees

1612 Then they understood that he said not that they should beware of
the leaven of bread but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and
Sadducees

1613 And Jesus came into the quarters of Cesarea Philippi and he
asked his disciples saying Whom do men say that the Son of man is

1614 But they said Some John the Baptist and other some Elias and
others Jeremias or one of the prophets

1615 Jesus saith to them But whom do you say that I am

1616 Simon Peter answered and said Thou art Christ the Son of the
living God

1617 And Jesus answering said to him Blessed art thou Simon
BarJona because flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee but my
Father who is in heaven

1618 And I say to thee That thou art Peter and upon this rock I
will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against
it

Thou art Peter etc  As St Peter by divine revelation here made a
solemn profession of his faith of the divinity of Christ so in
recompense of this faith and profession our Lord here declares to him
the dignity to which he is pleased to raise him viz that he to whom
he had already given the name of Peter signifying a rock St John 1
42 should be a rock indeed of invincible strength for the support of
the building of the church in which building he should be next to
Christ himself the chief foundation stone in quality of chief pastor
ruler and governor and should have accordingly all fulness of
ecclesiastical power signified by the keys of the kingdom of heaven
Upon this rock etc  The words of Christ to Peter spoken in the
vulgar language of the Jews which our Lord made use of were the same
as if he had said in English Thou art a Rock and upon this rock I
will build my church So that by the plain course of the words Peter
is here declared to be the rock upon which the church was to be built
Christ himself being both the principal foundation and founder of the
same Where also note that Christ by building his house that is his
church upon a rock has thereby secured it against all storms and
floods like the wise builder St Matt 7 24 25 The gates of hell
etc  That is the powers of darkness and whatever Satan can do
either by himself or his agents For as the church is here likened to
a house or fortress built on a rock so the adverse powers are
likened to a contrary house or fortress the gates of which that is
the whole strength and all the efforts it can make will never be able
to prevail over the city or church of Christ By this promise we are
fully assured that neither idolatry heresy nor any pernicious error
whatsoever shall at any time prevail over the church of Christ

1619 And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven And
whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth it shall be bound also in
heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth it shall be loosed
also in heaven

Loose on earth  The loosing the bands of temporal punishments due to
sins is called an indulgence the power of which is here granted

1620 Then he commanded his disciples that they should tell no one
that he was Jesus the Christ

1621 From that time Jesus began to shew to his disciples that he
must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the ancients and
scribes and chief priests and be put to death and the third day rise
again

1622 And Peter taking him began to rebuke him saying Lord be it
far from thee this shall not be unto thee

And Peter taking him  That is taking him aside out of a tender
love respect and zeal for his Lord and Masters honour began to
expostulate with him as it were to rebuke him saying Lord far be it
from thee to suffer death but the Lord said to Peter ver 23 Go
behind me Satan These words may signify Begone from me but the holy
Fathers expound them otherwise that is come after me or follow me
and by these words the Lord would have Peter to follow him in his
suffering and not to oppose the divine will by contradiction for the
word satan means in Hebrew an adversary or one that opposes

1623 Who turning said to Peter Go behind me Satan thou art a
scandal unto me because thou savourest not the things that are of God
but the things that are of men

1624 Then Jesus said to his disciples If any man will come after me
let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me

1625 For he that will save his life shall lose it and he that shall
lose his life for my sake shall find it

1626 For what doth it profit a man if he gain the whole world and
suffer the loss of his own soul Or what exchange shall a man give for
his soul

1627 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with
his angels and then will he render to every man according to his
works

1628 Amen I say to you there are some of them that stand here that
shall not taste death till they see the Son of man coming in his
kingdom



Matthew Chapter 17


The Transfiguration of Christ He cures the lunatic child foretells
his passion and pays the didrachma

171 And after six days Jesus taketh unto him Peter and James and
John his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart

172 And he was transfigured before them And his face did shine as
the sun and his garments became white as snow

173 And behold there appeared to them Moses and Elias talking with
him

174 And Peter answering said to Jesus Lord it is good for us to be
here if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacles one for thee
and one for Moses and one for Elias

175 And as he was yet speaking behold a bright cloud overshadowed
them And lo a voice out of the cloud saying This is my beloved Son
in whom I am well pleased hear ye him

176 And the disciples hearing fell upon their face and were very
much afraid

177 And Jesus came and touched them and said to them Arise and
fear not

178 And they lifting up their eyes saw no one but only Jesus

179 And as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them
saying Tell the vision to no man till the Son of man be risen from
the dead

1710 And his disciples asked him saying Why then do the scribes say
that Elias must come first

1711 But he answering said to them Elias indeed shall come and
restore all things

1712 But I say to you that Elias is already come and they knew him
not But have done unto him whatsoever they had a mind So also the Son
of man shall suffer from them

1713 Then the disciples understood that he had spoken to them of
John the Baptist

1714 And when he was come to the multitude there came to him a man
falling down on his knees before him saying Lord have pity on my son
for he is a lunatic and suffereth much for he falleth often into the
fire and often into the water

1715 And I brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him

1716 Then Jesus answered and said O unbelieving and perverse
generation how long shall I be with you How long shall I suffer you
Bring him hither to me

1717 And Jesus rebuked him and the devil went out of him and the
child was cured from that hour

1718 Then came the disciples to Jesus secretly and said Why could
not we cast him out

1719 Jesus said to them Because of your unbelief For amen I say to
you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say to
this mountain Remove from hence hither and it shall remove and
nothing shall be impossible to you

As a grain of mustard seed  That is a perfect faith which in its
properties and its fruits resembles the grain of mustard seed in the
parable chap 13 31

1720 But this kind is not cast out but by prayer and fasting

1721 And when they abode together in Galilee Jesus said to them The
Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men

1722 And they shall kill him and the third day he shall rise again
And they were troubled exceedingly

1723 And when they were come to Capharnaum they that received the
didrachmas came to Peter and said to him Doth not your master pay
the didrachma

The didrachmas  A didrachma was half a sicle or half a stater that
is about 15d English which was a tax laid upon every head for the
service of the temple

1724 He said Yes And when he was come into the house Jesus
prevented him saying What is thy opinion Simon The kings of the
earth of whom do they receive tribute or custom of their own
children or of strangers

1725 And he said Of strangers Jesus said to him Then the children
are free

1726 But that we may not scandalize them go to the sea and cast in
a hook and that fish which shall first come up take and when thou
hast opened its mouth thou shalt find a stater take that and give
it to them for me and thee



Matthew Chapter 18


Christ teaches humility to beware of scandal and to flee the
occasions of sin to denounce to the church incorrigible sinners and
to look upon such as refuse to hear the church as heathens He promises
to his disciples the power of binding and loosing and that he will be
in the midst of their assemblies No forgiveness for them that will not
forgive

181 At that hour the disciples came to Jesus saying Who thinkest
thou is the greater in the kingdom of heaven

182 And Jesus calling unto him a little child set him in the midst
of them

183 And said amen I say to you unless you be converted and become
as little children you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven

184 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child he
is the greater in the kingdom of heaven

185 And he that shall receive one such little child in my name
receiveth me

186 But he that shall scandalize one of these little ones that
believe in me it were better for him that a millstone should be hanged
about his neck and that he should be drowned in the depth of the sea

Shall scandalize  That is shall put a stumblingblock in their way
and cause them to fall into sin

187 Woe to the world because of scandals For it must needs be that
scandals come but nevertheless woe to that man by whom the scandal
cometh

It must needs be etc  Viz considering the wickedness and
corruption of the world

188 And if thy hand or thy foot scandalize thee cut it off and
cast it from thee It is better for thee to go into life maimed or
lame than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting
fire

Scandalize thee  That is cause thee to offend

189 And if thy eye scandalize thee pluck it out and cast it from
thee It is better for thee having one eye to enter into life than
having two eyes to be cast into hell fire

1810 See that you despise not one of these little ones for I say to
you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father who
is in heaven

1811 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost

1812 What think you If a man have an hundred sheep and one of them
should go astray doth he not leave the ninetynine in the mountains
and goeth to seek that which is gone astray

1813 And if it so be that he find it Amen I say to you he rejoiceth
more for that than for the ninetynine that went not astray

1814 Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven
that one of these little ones should perish

1815 But if thy brother shall offend against thee go and rebuke him
between thee and him alone If he shall hear thee thou shalt gain thy
brother

1816 And if he will not hear thee take with thee one or two more
that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may stand

1817 And if he will not hear them tell the church And if he will
not hear the church let him be to thee as the heathen and publican

1818 Amen I say to you whatsoever you shall bind upon earth shall
be bound also in heaven and whatsoever you shall loose upon earth
shall be loosed also in heaven

1819 Again I say to you that if two of you shall consent upon earth
concerning anything whatsoever they shall ask it shall be done to them
by my Father who is in heaven

1820 For where there are two or three gathered together in my name
there am I in the midst of them

There am I in the midst of them  This is understood of such
assemblies only as are gathered in the name and authority of Christ
and in unity of the church of Christ St Cyprian De Unitate
Ecclesiae

1821 Then came Peter unto him and said Lord how often shall my
brother offend against me and I forgive him till seven times

1822 Jesus saith to him I say not to thee till seven times but
till seventy times seven times

1823 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened to a king who would
take an account of his servants

1824 And when he had begun to take the account one as brought to
him that owed him ten thousand talents

Talents  A talent was seven hundred and fifty ounces of silver which
at the rate of five shillings to the ounce is a hundred and
eightyseven pounds ten shillings sterling

1825 And as he had not wherewith to pay it his lord commanded that
he should be sold and his wife and children and all that he had and
payment to be made

1826 But that servant falling down besought him saying Have
patience with me and I will pay thee all

1827 And the lord of that servant being moved with pity let him go
and forgave him the debt

1828 But when that servant was gone out he found one of his
fellowservants that owed him an hundred pence and laying hold of him
he throttled him saying Pay what thou owest

Pence  The Roman penny was the eighth part of an ounce that is
about sevenpence halfpenny English

1829 And his fellowservant falling down besought him saying Have
patience with me and I will pay thee all

1830 And he would not but went and cast him into prison till he
paid the debt

1831 Now his fellow servants seeing what was done were very much
grieved and they came and told their lord all that was done

1832 Then his lord called him and said to him Thou wicked servant
I forgave thee all the debt because thou besoughtest me

1833 Shouldst not thou then have had compassion also on thy fellow
servant even as I had compassion on thee

1834 And his lord being angry delivered him to the torturers until
he paid all the debt

1835 So also shall my heavenly Father do to you if you forgive not
every one his brother from your hearts



Matthew Chapter 19


Christ declares matrimony to be indissoluble he recommends the making
ones self an eunuch for the kingdom of heaven and parting with all
things for him He shews the danger of riches and the reward of
leaving all to follow him

191 And it came to pass when Jesus had ended these words he departed
from Galilee and came into the coasts of Judea beyond Jordan

192 And great multitudes followed him and he healed them there

193 And there came to him the Pharisees tempting him saying Is it
lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause

194 Who answering said to them Have ye not read that he who made
man from the beginning made them male and female And he said

195 For this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall
cleave to his wife and they two shall be in one flesh

196 Therefore now they are not two but one flesh What therefore God
hath joined together let no man put asunder

197 They say to him Why then did Moses command to give a bill of
divorce and to put away

198 He saith to them Because Moses by reason of the hardness of your
heart permitted you to put away your wives but from the beginning it
was not so

199 And I say to you that whosoever shall put away his wife except
it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery
and he that shall marry her that is put away committeth adultery

Except it be etc  In the case of fornication that is of adultery
the wife may be put away but even then the husband cannot marry
another as long as the wife is living

1910 His disciples say unto him If the case of a man with his wife
be so it is not expedient to marry

1911 Who said to them All men take not this word but they to whom
it is given

All men take not this word  That is all receive not the gift of
living singly and chastely unless they pray for the grace of God to
enable them to live so and for some it may be necessary to that end to
fast as well as pray and to those it is given from above

1912 For there are eunuchs who were born so from their mothers womb
and there are eunuchs who were made so by men and there are eunuchs
who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven He that can
take let him take it

There are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of
heaven  This text is not to be taken in the literal sense but means
that there are such who have taken a firm and commendable resolution
of leading a single and chaste life in order to serve God in a more
perfect state than those who marry as St Paul clearly shews 1 Cor
7 37 38

1913 Then were little children presented to him that he should
impose hands upon them and pray And the disciples rebuked them

1914 But Jesus said to them Suffer the little children and forbid
them not to come to me for the kingdom of heaven is for such

1915 And when he had imposed hands upon them he departed from
thence

1916 And behold one came and said to him Good master what good
shall I do that I may have life everlasting

1917 Who said to him Why askest thou me concerning good One is
good God But if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments

1918 He said to him Which And Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder
Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not
bear false witness

1919 Honour thy father and thy mother and Thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself

1920 The young man saith to him All these have I kept from my youth
what is yet wanting to me

1921 Jesus saith to him If thou wilt be perfect go sell what thou
hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and
come follow me

1922 And when the young man had heard this word he went away sad
for he had great possessions

1923 Then Jesus said to his disciples Amen I say to you that a
rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven

1924 And again I say to you It is easier for a camel to pass through
the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of
heaven

1925 And when they had heard this the disciples wondered much
saying Who then can be saved

1926 And Jesus beholding said to them With men this is impossible
but with God all things are possible

1927 Then Peter answering said to him Behold we have left all
things and have followed thee what therefore shall we have

1928 And Jesus said to them Amen I say to you that you who have
followed me in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit on the
seat of his majesty you also shall sit on twelve seats judging the
twelve tribes of Israel

1929 And every one that hath left house or brethren or sisters or
father or mother or wife or children or lands for my names sake
shall receive an hundredfold and shall possess life everlasting

1930 And many that are first shall be last and the last shall be
first



Matthew Chapter 20


The parable of the labourers in the vineyard The ambition of the two
sons of Zebedee Christ gives sight to two blind men

201 The kingdom of heaven is like to an householder who went out
early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard

202 And having agreed with the labourers for a penny a day he sent
them into his vineyard

203 And going out about the third hour he saw others standing in the
marketplace idle

204 And he said to them Go you also into my vineyard and I will
give you what shall be just

205 And they went their way And again he went out about the sixth
and the ninth hour and did in like manner

206 But about the eleventh hour he went out and found others
standing and he saith to them Why stand you here all the day idle

207 They say to him Because no man hath hired us He saith to them
Go ye also into my vineyard

208 And when evening was come the lord of the vineyard saith to his
steward Call the labourers and pay them their hire beginning from the
last even to the first

209 When therefore they were come that came about the eleventh hour
they received every man a penny

2010 But when the first also came they thought that they should
receive more And they also received every man a penny

2011 And receiving it they murmured against the master of the house

2012 Saying These last have worked but one hour and thou hast made
them equal to us that have borne the burden of the day and the heats

2013 But he answering said to one of them friend I do thee no
wrong didst thou not agree with me for a penny

2014 Take what is thine and go thy way I will also give to this
last even as to thee

2015 Or is it not lawful for me to do what I will Is thy eye evil
because I am good

What I will  Viz with my own and in matters that depend on my own
bounty

2016 So shall the last be first and the first last For many are
called but few chosen

2017 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart
and said to them

2018 Behold we go up to Jerusalem and the Son of man shall be
betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes and they shall condemn
him to death

2019 And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged
and crucified and the third day he shall rise again

2020 Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her
sons adoring and asking something of him

2021 Who said to her What wilt thou She saith to him say that
these my two sons may sit the one on thy right hand and the other on
thy left in thy kingdom

2022 And Jesus answering said You know not what you ask Can you
drink the chalice that I shall drink They say to him We can

2023 He saith to them My chalice indeed you shall drink but to sit
on my right or left hand is not mine to give to you but to them for
whom it is prepared by my Father

2024 And the ten hearing it were moved with indignation against the
two brethren

2025 But Jesus called them to him and said You know that the princes
of the Gentiles lord it over them and that they that are the greater
exercise power upon them

2026 It shall not be so among you but whosoever is the greater among
you let him be your minister

2027 And he that will be first among you shall be your servant

2028 Even as the Son of man is not come to be ministered unto but to
minister and to give his life a redemption for many

2029 And when they went out from Jericho a great multitude followed
him

2030 And behold two blind men sitting by the way side heard that
Jesus passed by And they cried out saying O Lord thou son of David
have mercy on us

2031 And the multitude rebuked them that they should hold their
peace But they cried out the more saying O Lord thou son of David
have mercy on us

2032 And Jesus stood and called them and said What will ye that I do
to you

2033 They say to him Lord that our eyes be opened

2034 And Jesus having compassion on them touched their eyes And
immediately they saw and followed him



Matthew Chapter 21


Christ rides into Jerusalem upon an ass He casts the buyers and
sellers out of the temple curses the fig tree and puts to silence the
priests and scribes

211 And when they drew nigh to Jerusalem and were come to Bethphage
unto mount Olivet then Jesus sent two disciples

212 Saying to them Go ye into the village that is over against you
and immediately you shall find an ass tied and a colt with her Loose
them and bring them to me

213 And if any man shall say anything to you say ye that the Lord
hath need of them And forthwith he will let them go

214 Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
by the prophet saying

215 Tell ye the daughter of Sion Behold thy king cometh to thee
meek and sitting upon an ass and a colt the foal of her that is used
to the yoke

216 And the disciples going did as Jesus commanded them

217 And they brought the ass and the colt and laid their garments
upon them and made him sit thereon

218 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way and
others cut boughs from the trees and strewed them in the way

219 And the multitudes that went before and that followed cried
saying Hosanna to the son of David Blessed is he that cometh in the
name of the Lord Hosanna in the highest

2110 And when he was come into Jerusalem the whole city was moved
saying Who is this

2111 And the people said This is Jesus the prophet from Nazareth of
Galilee

2112 And Jesus went into the temple of God and cast out all them that
sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money
changers and the chairs of them that sold doves

2113 And he saith to them It is written My house shall be called
the house of prayer but you have made it a den of thieves

2114 And there came to him the blind and the lame in the temple and
he healed them

2115 And the chief priests and scribes seeing the wonderful things
that he did and the children crying in the temple and saying Hosanna
to the son of David were moved with indignation

2116 And said to him Hearest thou what these say And Jesus said to
them Yea have you never read Out of the mouth of infants and of
sucklings thou hast perfected praise

2117 And leaving them he went out of the city into Bethania and
remained here

2118 And in the morning returning into the city he was hungry

2119 And seeing a certain fig tree by the way side he came to it and
found nothing on it but leaves only And he saith to it May no fruit
grow on thee henceforward for ever And immediately the fig tree
withered away

2120 And the disciples seeing it wondered saying How is it
presently withered away

2121 And Jesus answering said to them Amen I say to you if you
shall have faith and stagger not not only this of the fig tree shall
you do but also if you shall say to this mountain Take up and cast
thyself into the sea it shall be done

2122 And all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believing you
shall receive

2123 And when he was come into the temple there came to him as he
was teaching the chief priests and ancients of the people saying By
what authority dost thou these things And who hath given thee this
authority

2124 Jesus answering said to them I also will ask you one word
which if you shall tell me I will also tell you by what authority I do
these things

2125 The baptism of John whence was it From heaven or from men But
they thought within themselves saying

2126 If we shall say from heaven he will say to us Why then did
you not believe him But if we shall say from men we are afraid of
the multitude for all held John as a prophet

2127 And answering Jesus they said We know not He also said to
them Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things

2128 But what think you A certain man had two sons and coming to
the first he said Son go work to day in my vineyard

2129 And he answering said I will not But afterwards being moved
with repentance he went

2130 And coming to the other he said in like manner And he
answering said I go Sir And he went not

2131 Which of the two did the fathers will They say to him The
first Jesus saith to them Amen I say to you that the publicans and
the harlots shall go into the kingdom of God before you

2132 For John came to you in the way of justice and you did not
believe him But the publicans and the harlots believed him but you
seeing it did not even afterwards repent that you might believe him

2133 Hear ye another parable There was a man an householder who
planted a vineyard and made a hedge round about it and dug in it a
press and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a
strange country

2134 And when the time of the fruits drew nigh he sent his servants
to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits thereof

2135 And the husbandmen laying hands on his servants beat one and
killed another and stoned another

2136 Again he sent other servants more than the former and they did
to them in like manner

2137 And last of all he sent to them his son saying They will
reverence my son

2138 But the husbandmen seeing the son said among themselves This
is the heir come let us kill him and we shall have his inheritance

2139 And taking him they cast him forth out of the vineyard and
killed him

2140 When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come what will he
do to those husbandmen

2141 They say to him He will bring those evil men to an evil end and
let out his vineyard to other husbandmen that shall render him the
fruit in due season

2142 Jesus saith to them Have you never read in the Scriptures The
stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the
corner By the Lord this has been done and it is wonderful in our
eyes

2143 Therefore I say to you that the kingdom of God shall be taken
from you and shall be given to a nation yielding the fruits thereof

2144 And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken but on
whomsoever it shall fall it shall grind him to powder

2145 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables
they knew that he spoke of them

2146 And seeking to lay hands on him they feared the multitudes
because they held him as a prophet



Matthew Chapter 22


The parable of the marriage feast Christ orders tribute to be paid to
Caesar He confutes the Sadducees shews which is the first commandment
in the law and puzzles the Pharisees

221 And Jesus answering spoke again in parables to them saying

222 The kingdom of heaven is likened to a king who made a marriage
for his son

223 And he sent his servants to call them that were invited to the
marriage and they would not come

224 Again he sent other servants saying Tell them that were
invited Behold I have prepared my dinner my beeves and fatlings are
killed and all things are ready Come ye to the marriage

225 But they neglected and went their ways one to his farm and
another to his merchandise

226 And the rest laid hands on his servants and having treated them
contumeliously put them to death

227 But when the king had heard of it he was angry and sending his
armies he destroyed those murderers and burnt their city

228 Then he saith to his servants The marriage indeed is ready but
they that were invited were not worthy

229 Go ye therefore into the highways and as many as you shall find
call to the marriage

2210 And his servants going forth into the ways gathered together
all that they found both bad and good and the marriage was filled
with guests

2211 And the king went in to see the guests and he saw there a man
who had not on a wedding garment

2212 And he saith to him Friend how camest thou in hither not
having on a wedding garment But he was silent

2213 Then the king said to the waiters Bind his hands and feet and
cast him into the exterior darkness There shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth

2214 For many are called but few are chosen

2215 Then the Pharisees going consulted among themselves how to
insnare him in his speech

2216 And they sent to him their disciples with the Herodians saying
Master we know that thou art a true speaker and teachest the way of
God in truth Neither carest thou for any man for thou dost not regard
the person of men

The Herodians  That is some that belonged to Herod and that joined
with him in standing up for the necessity of paying tribute to Caesar
that is to the Roman emperor Some are of opinion that there was a
sect among the Jews called Herodians from their maintaining that Herod
was the Messias

2217 Tell us therefore what dost thou think Is it lawful to give
tribute to Caesar or not

2218 But Jesus knowing their wickedness said Why do you tempt me
ye hypocrites

2219 Shew me the coin of the tribute And they offered him a penny

2220 And Jesus saith to them Whose image and inscription is this

2221 They say to him Caesars Then he saith to them Render
therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesars and to God the
things that are Gods

2222 And hearing this they wondered and leaving him went their
ways

2223 That day there came to him the Sadducees who say there is no
resurrection and asked him

2224 Saying Master Moses said If a man die having no son his
brother shall marry his wife and raise up issue to his brother

2225 Now there were with us seven brethren and the first having
married a wife died and not having issue left his wife to his
brother

2226 In like manner the second and the third and so on to the
seventh

2227 And last of all the woman died also

2228 At the resurrection therefore whose wife of the seven shall she
be For they all had her

2229 And Jesus answering said to them You err not knowing the
Scriptures nor the power of God

2230 For in the resurrection they shall neither marry nor be married
but shall be as the angels of God in heaven

2231 And concerning the resurrection of the dead have you not read
that which was spoken by God saying to you

2232 I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of
Jacob He is not the God of the dead but of the living

2233 And the multitudes hearing it were in admiration at his
doctrine

2234 But the Pharisees hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees
came together

2235 And one of them a doctor of the law asked him tempting him

2236 Master which is the great commandment in the law

2237 Jesus said to him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy
whole heart and with thy whole soul and with thy whole mind

2238 This is the greatest and the first commandment

2239 And the second is like to this Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself

2240 On these two commandments dependeth the whole law and the
prophets

2241 And the Pharisees being gathered together Jesus asked them

2242 Saying What think you of Christ Whose son is he They say to
him Davids

2243 He saith to them How then doth David in spirit call him Lord
saying

2244 The Lord said to my Lord Sit on my right hand until I make thy
enemies thy footstool

2245 If David then call him Lord how is he his son

2246 And no man was able to answer him a word neither durst any man
from that day forth ask him any more questions



Matthew Chapter 23


Christ admonishes the people to follow the good doctrine not the bad
example of the scribes and Pharisees He warns his disciples not to
imitate their ambition and denounces divers woes against them for their
hypocrisy and blindness

231 Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples

232 Saying The scribes and the Pharisees have sitten on the chair of
Moses

233 All things therefore whatsoever they shall say to you observe
and do but according to their works do ye not For they say and do
not

234 For they bind heavy and insupportable burdens and lay them on
mens shoulders but with a finger of their own they will not move
them

235 And all their works they do for to be seen of men For they make
their phylacteries broad and enlarge their fringes

Phylacteries  that is parchments on which they wrote the ten
commandments and carried them on their foreheads before their eyes
which the Pharisees affected to wear broader than other men so to seem
more zealous for the law

236 And they love the first places at feasts and the first chairs in
the synagogues

237 And salutations in the market place and to be called by men
Rabbi

238 But be not you called Rabbi For one is your master and all you
are brethren

239 And call none your father upon earth for one is your father who
is in heaven

Call none your fatherNeither be ye called masters etc  The
meaning is that our Father in heaven is incomparably more to be
regarded than any father upon earth and no master to be followed who
would lead us away from Christ But this does not hinder but that we
are by the law of God to have a due respect both for our parents and
spiritual fathers 1 Cor 4 2315 and for our masters and teachers

2310 Neither be ye called masters for one is your master Christ

2311 He that is the greatest among you shall be your servant

2312 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled and he that
shall humble himself shall be exalted

2313 But woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because you
shut the kingdom of heaven against men for you yourselves do not enter
in and those that are going in you suffer not to enter

2314 Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because you devour
the houses of widows praying long prayers For this you shall receive
the greater judgment

2315 Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because you go
round about the sea and the land to make one proselyte And when he is
made you make him the child of hell twofold more than yourselves

2316 Woe to you blind guides that say Whosoever shall swear by the
temple it is nothing but he that shall swear by the gold of the
temple is a debtor

2317 Ye foolish and blind for whether is greater the gold or the
temple that sanctifieth the gold

2318 And whosoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing but
whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it is a debtor

2319 Ye foolish and blind for whether is greater the gift or the
altar that sanctifieth the gift

2320 He therefore that sweareth by the altar sweareth by it and by
all things that are upon it

2321 And whosoever shall swear by the temple sweareth by it and by
him that dwelleth in it

2322 And he that sweareth by heaven sweareth by the throne of God and
by him that sitteth thereon

2323 Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because you tithe
mint and anise and cummin and have left the weightier things of the
law judgment and mercy and faith These things you ought to have done
and not to leave those undone

2324 Blind guides who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel

2325 Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because you make
clean the outside of the cup and of the dish but within you are full
of rapine and uncleanness

2326 Thou blind Pharisee first make clean the inside of the cup and
of the dish that the outside may become clean

2327 Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because you are
like to whited sepulchres which outwardly appear to men beautiful but
within are full of dead mens bones and of all filthiness

2328 So you also outwardly indeed appear to men just but inwardly
you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity

2329 Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites that build the
sepulchres of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the just

Build the sepulchres etc  This is not blamed as if it were in
itself evil to build or adorn the monuments of the prophets but the
hypocrisy of the Pharisees is here taxed who whilst they pretended to
honour the memory of the prophets were persecuting even unto death the
Lord of the prophets

2330 And say If we had been in the days of our fathers we would not
have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets

2331 Wherefore you are witnesses against yourselves that you are the
sons of them that killed the prophets

2332 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers

2333 You serpents generation of vipers how will you flee from the
judgment of hell

2334 Therefore behold I send to you prophets and wise men and
scribes and some of them you will put to death and crucify and some
you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city

2335 That upon you may come all the just blood that hath been shed
upon the earth from the blood of Abel the just even unto the blood of
Zacharias the son of Barachias whom you killed between the temple and
the altar

That upon you may come etc  Not that they should suffer more than
their own sins justly deserved but that the justice of God should now
fall upon them with such a final vengeance once for all as might
comprise all the different kinds of judgments and punishments that had
at any time before been inflicted for the shedding of just blood

2336 Amen I say to you all these things shall come upon this
generation

2337 Jerusalem Jerusalem thou that killest the prophets and stonest
them that are sent unto thee how often would I have gathered together
thy children as the hen doth gather her chickens under her wings and
thou wouldst not

2338 Behold your house shall be left to you desolate

2339 For I say to you you shall not see me henceforth till you say
Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord



Matthew Chapter 24


Christ foretells the destruction of the temple with the signs that
shall come before it and before the last judgment We must always
watch

241 And Jesus being come out of the temple went away And his
disciples came to shew him the buildings of the temple

242 And he answering said to them Do you see all these things Amen
I say to you there shall not be left here a stone upon a stone that
shall not be destroyed

243 And when he was sitting on mount Olivet the disciples came to
him privately saying Tell us when shall these things be And what
shall be the sign of thy coming and of the consummation of the world

244 And Jesus answering said to them Take heed that no man seduce
you

245 For many will come in my name saying I am Christ And they will
seduce many

246 And you shall hear of wars and rumours of wars See that ye be
not troubled For these things must come to pass but the end is not
yet

247 For nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against
kingdom And there shall be pestilences and famines and earthquakes in
places

248 Now all these are the beginnings of sorrows

249 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall put you
to death and you shall be hated by all nations for my names sake

2410 And then shall many be scandalized and shall betray one another
and shall hate one another

2411 And many false prophets shall rise and shall seduce many

2412 And because iniquity hath abounded the charity of many shall
grow cold

2413 But he that shall persevere to the end he shall be saved

2414 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole
world for a testimony to all nations and then shall the consummation
come

2415 When therefore you shall see the abomination of desolation
which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet standing in the holy place
he that readeth let him understand

2416 Then they that are in Judea let them flee to the mountains

2417 And he that is on the housetop let him not come down to take
any thing out of his house

2418 And he that is in the field let him not go back to take his
coat

2419 And woe to them that are with child and that give suck in those
days

2420 But pray that your flight be not in the winter or on the
sabbath

2421 For there shall be then great tribulation such as hath not been
from the beginning of the world until now neither shall be

2422 And unless those days had been shortened no flesh should be
saved but for the sake of the elect those days shall be shortened

2423 Then if any man shall say to you Lo here is Christ or there
do not believe him

2424 For there shall arise false Christs and false prophets and shall
shew great signs and wonders insomuch as to deceive if possible even
the elect

2425 Behold I have told it to you beforehand

2426 If therefore they shall say to you Behold he is in the desert
go ye not out Behold he is in the closets believe it not

2427 For as lightning cometh out of the east and appeareth even into
the west so shall also the cowling of the Son of man be

2428 Wheresoever the body shall be there shall the eagles also be
gathered together

Wheresoever etc  The coming of Christ shall be sudden and manifest
to all the world like lightning and wheresoever he shall come
thither shall all mankind be gathered to him as eagles are gathered
about a dead body

2429 And immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun
shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars
shall fall from heaven and the powers of heaven shall be moved

The stars  Or flaming meteors resembling stars

2430 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven And
then shall all tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the Son of
man coming in the clouds of heaven with much power and majesty

The sign etc  The cross of Christ

2431 And he shall send his angels with a trumpet and a great voice
and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from the
farthest parts of the heavens to the utmost bounds of them

2432 And from the fig tree learn a parable When the branch thereof
is now tender and the leaves come forth you know that summer is nigh

2433 So you also when you shall see all these things know ye that
it is nigh even at the doors

2434 Amen I say to you that this generation shall not pass till all
these things be done

2435 Heaven and earth shall pass but my words shall not pass

Shall pass  Because they shall be changed at the end of the world
into a new heaven and new earth

2436 But of that day and hour no one knoweth no not the angels of
heaven but the Father alone

2437 And as in the days of Noe so shall also the coming of the Son
of man be

2438 For as in the days before the flood they were eating and
drinking marrying and giving in marriage even till that day in which
Noe entered into the ark

2439 And they knew not till the flood came and took them all away so
also shall the coming of the Son of man be

2440 Then two shall be in the field One shall be taken and one shall
be left

2441 Two women shall be grinding at the mill One shall be taken and
one shall be left

2442 Watch ye therefore because you know not what hour your Lord
will come

2443 But this know ye that if the goodman of the house knew at what
hour the thief would come he would certainly watch and would not
suffer his house to be broken open

2444 Wherefore be you also ready because at what hour you know not
the Son of man will come

2445 Who thinkest thou is a faithful and wise servant whom his
lord hath appointed over his family to give them meat in season

2446 Blessed is that servant whom when his lord shall come he shall
find so doing

2447 Amen I say to you he shall place him over all his goods

2448 But if that evil servant shall say in his heart My lord is long
a coming

2449 And shall begin to strike his fellow servants and shall eat and
drink with drunkards

2450 The lord of that servant shall come in a day that he hopeth not
and at an hour that he knoweth not

2451 And shall separate him and appoint his portion with the
hypocrites There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth



Matthew Chapter 25


The parable of the ten virgins and of the talents The description of
the last judgment

251 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be like to ten virgins who
taking their lamps went out to meet the bridegroom and the bride

252 And five of them were foolish and five wise

253 But the five foolish having taken their lamps did not take oil
with them

254 But the wise took oil in their vessels with the lamps

255 And the bridegroom tarrying they all slumbered and slept

256 And at midnight there was a cry made Behold the bridegroom
cometh Go ye forth to meet him

257 Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps

258 And the foolish said to the wise Give us of your oil for our
lamps are gone out

259 The wise answered saying Lest perhaps there be not enough for
us and for you go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves

2510 Now whilst they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that
were ready went in with him to the marriage And the door was shut

2511 But at last came also the other virgins saying Lord Lord
open to us

2512 But he answering said Amen I say to you I know you not

2513 Watch ye therefore because you know not the day nor the hour

2514 For even as a man going into a far country called his servants
and delivered to them his goods

2515 And to one he gave five talents and to another two and to
another one to every one according to his proper ability and
immediately he took his journey

2516 And he that had received the five talents went his way and
traded with the same and gained other five

2517 And in like manner he that had received the two gained other
two

2518 But he that had received the one going his way digged into the
earth and hid his lords money

2519 But after a long time the lord of those servants came and
reckoned with them

2520 And he that had received the five talents coming brought other
five talents saying Lord thou didst deliver to me five talents
Behold I have gained other five over and above

2521 His lord said to him Well done good and faithful servant
because thou hast been faithful over a few things I will place thee
over many things Enter thou into the joy of thy lord

2522 And he also that had received the two talents came and said
Lord thou deliveredst two talents to me Behold I have gained other
two

2523 His lord said to him Well done good and faithful servant
because thou hast been faithful over a few things I will place thee
over many things Enter thou into the joy of thy lord

2524 But he that had received the one talent came and said Lord I
know that thou art a hard man thou reapest where thou hast not sown
and gatherest where thou hast not strewed

2525 And being afraid I went and hid thy talent in the earth Behold
here thou hast that which is thine

2526 And his lord answering said to him Wicked and slothful
servant thou knewest that I reap where I sow not and gather where I
have not strewed

2527 Thou oughtest therefore to have committed my money to the
bankers and at my coming I should have received my own with usury

2528 Take ye away therefore the talent from him and give it him that
hath ten talents

2529 For to every one that hath shall be given and he shall abound
but from him that hath not that also which he seemeth to have shall be
taken away

2530 And the unprofitable servant cast ye out into the exterior
darkness There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth

2531 And when the Son of man shall come in his majesty and all the
angels with him then shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty

2532 And all nations shall be gathered together before him and he
shall separate them one from another as the shepherd separateth the
sheep from the goats

2533 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on
his left

2534 Then shall the king say to them that shall be on his right hand
Come ye blessed of my Father possess you the kingdom prepared for you
from the foundation of the world

2535 For I was hungry and you gave me to eat I was thirsty and you
gave me to drink I was a stranger and you took me in

2536 Naked and you covered me sick and you visited me I was in
prison and you came to me

2537 Then shall the just answer him saying Lord when did we see
thee hungry and fed thee thirsty and gave thee drink

2538 Or when did we see thee a stranger and took thee in Or naked
and covered thee

2539 Or when did we see thee sick or in prison and came to thee

2540 And the king answering shall say to them Amen I say to you as
long as you did it to one of these my least brethren you did it to me

2541 Then he shall say to them also that shall be on his left hand
Depart from me you cursed into everlasting fire which was prepared
for the devil and his angels

2542 For I was hungry and you gave me not to eat I was thirsty and
you gave me not to drink

2543 I was a stranger and you took me not in naked and you covered
me not sick and in prison and you did not visit me

2544 Then they also shall answer him saying Lord when did we see
thee hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and
did not minister to thee

2545 Then he shall answer them saying Amen I say to you as long
as you did it not to one of these least neither did you do it to me

2546 And these shall go into everlasting punishment but the just
into life everlasting



Matthew Chapter 26


The Jews conspire against Christ He is anointed by Mary The treason
of Judas The last supper The prayer in the garden The apprehension
of our Lord His treatment in the house of Caiphas

261 And it came to pass when Jesus had ended all these words he
said to his disciples

262 You know that after two days shall be the pasch and the Son of
man shall be delivered up to be crucified

263 Then were gathered together the chief priests and ancients of the
people into the court of the high priest who was called Caiphas

264 And they consulted together that by subtilty they might apprehend
Jesus and put him to death

265 But they said Not on the festival day lest perhaps there should
be a tumult among the people

266 And when Jesus was in Bethania in the house of Simon the leper

267 There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of precious
ointment and poured it on his head as he was at table

268 And the disciples seeing it had indignation saying To what
purpose is this waste

269 For this might have been sold for much and given to the poor

2610 And Jesus knowing it said to them Why do you trouble this
woman For she hath wrought a good work upon me

2611 For the poor you have always with you but me you have not
always

Me you have not always  Viz in a visible manner as when conversant
here on earth and as we have the poor whom we may daily assist and
relieve

2612 For she in pouring this ointment on my body hath done it for my
burial

2613 Amen I say to you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in
the whole world that also which she hath done shall be told for a
memory of her

2614 Then went one of the twelve who was called Judas Iscariot to
the chief priests

2615 And said to them What will you give me and I will deliver him
unto you But they appointed him thirty pieces of silver

2616 And from thenceforth he sought opportunity to betray him

2617 And on the first day of the Azymes the disciples came to Jesus
saying Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the pasch

Azymes  Feast of the unleavened bread Pasch  The paschal lamb

2618 But Jesus said Go ye into the city to a certain man and say to
him The master saith My time is near at hand With thee I make the
pasch with my disciples

2619 And the disciples did as Jesus appointed to them and they
prepared the pasch

2620 But when it was evening he sat down with his twelve disciples

2621 And whilst they were eating he said Amen I say to you that one
of you is about to betray me

2622 And they being very much troubled began every one to say Is it
I Lord

2623 But he answering said He that dippeth his hand with me in the
dish he shall betray me

2624 The Son of man indeed goeth as it is written of him But woe to
that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed It were better for
him if that man had not been born

2625 And Judas that betrayed him answering said Is it I Rabbi He
saith to him Thou hast said it

2626 And whilst they were at supper Jesus took bread and blessed and
broke and gave to his disciples and said Take ye and eat This is my
body

This is my body  He does not say This is the figure of my bodybut
This is my body 2 Council of Nice Act 6 Neither does he say in
this or with this is my body but absolutely This is my body which
plainly implies transubstantiation

2627 And taking the chalice he gave thanks and gave to them saying
Drink ye all of this

Drink ye all of this  This was spoken to the twelve apostles who
were the all then present and they all drank of it says St Mark 14
23 But it no ways follows from these words spoken to the apostles
that all the faithful are here commanded to drink of the chalice any
more than that all the faithful are commanded to consecrate offer and
administer this sacrament because Christ upon this same occasion and
at the same time bid the apostles do so in these words St Luke 22
19 Do this for a commemoration of me

2628 For this is my blood of the new testament which shall be shed
for many unto remission of sins

Blood of the new testament  As the old testament was dedicated with
the blood of victims by Moses in these words This is the blood of
the testament etc Heb 9 20 so here is the dedication and
institution of the new testament in the blood of Christ here
mystically shed by these words This is the blood of the new testament
etc

2629 And I say to you I will not drink from henceforth of this fruit
of the vine until that day when I shall drink it with you new in the
kingdom of my Father

Fruit of the vine  These words by the account of St Luke 2622 18
were not spoken of the sacramental cup but of the wine that was drunk
with the paschal lamb Though the sacramental cup might also be called
the fruit of the vine because it was consecrated from wine and
retains the likeness and all the accidents or qualities of wine

2630 And a hymn being said they went out unto mount Olivet

2631 Then Jesus saith to them All you shall be scandalized in me
this night For it is written I will strike the shepherd and the
sheep of the flock shall be dispersed

Scandalized in me etc  Forasmuch as my being apprehended shall make
you all run away and forsake me

2632 But after I shall be risen again I will go before you into
Galilee

2633 And Peter answering said to him Although all shall be
scandalized in thee I will never be scandalized

2634 Jesus said to him Amen I say to thee that in this night before
the cock crow thou wilt deny me thrice

2635 Peter saith to him Yea though I should die with thee I will
not deny thee And in like manner said all the disciples

2636 Then Jesus came with them into a country place which is called
Gethsemani And he said to his disciples Sit you here till I go
yonder and pray

2637 And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee he began
to grow sorrowful and to be sad

2638 Then he saith to them My soul is sorrowful even unto death
Stay you here and watch with me

2639 And going a little further he fell upon his face praying and
saying My Father if it be possible let this chalice pass from me
Nevertheless not as I will but as thou wilt

2640 And he cometh to his disciples and findeth them asleep And he
saith to Peter What Could you not watch one hour with me

2641 Watch ye and pray that ye enter not into temptation The spirit
indeed is willing but the flesh is weak

2642 Again the second time he went and prayed saying My Father if
this chalice may not pass away but I must drink it thy will be done

2643 And he cometh again and findeth them sleeping for their eyes
were heavy

2644 And leaving them he went again and he prayed the third time
saying the selfsame word

2645 Then he cometh to his disciples and said to them Sleep ye now
and take your rest Behold the hour is at hand and the Son of man
shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners

2646 Rise let us go Behold he is at hand that will betray me

2647 As he yet spoke behold Judas one of the twelve came and with
him a great multitude with swords and clubs sent from the chief
priests and the ancients of the people

2648 And he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying Whomsoever I
shall kiss that is he Hold him fast

2649 And forthwith coming to Jesus he said Hail Rabbi And he
kissed him

2650 And Jesus said to him Friend whereto art thou come Then they
came up and laid hands on Jesus and held him

2651 And behold one of them that were with Jesus stretching forth
his hand drew out his sword and striking the servant of the high
priest cut off his ear

2652 Then Jesus saith to him Put up again thy sword into its place
for all that take the sword shall perish with the sword

2653 Thinkest thou that I cannot ask my Father and he will give me
presently more than twelve legions of angels

2654 How then shall the scriptures be fulfilled that so it must be
done

2655 In that same hour Jesus said to the multitudes You are come
out as it were to a robber with swords and clubs to apprehend me I
sat daily with you teaching in the temple and you laid not hands on
me

2656 Now all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might
be fulfilled Then the disciples all leaving him fled

2657 But they holding Jesus led him to Caiphas the high priest where
the scribes and the ancients were assembled

2658 And Peter followed him afar off even to the court of the high
priest And going in he sat with the servants that he might see the
end

2659 And the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness
against Jesus that they might put him to death

2660 And they found not whereas many false witnesses had come in
And last of all there came two false witnesses

2661 And they said This man said I am able to destroy the temple of
God and after three days to rebuild it

2662 And the high priest rising up said to him Answerest thou
nothing to the things which these witness against thee

2663 But Jesus held his peace And the high priest said to him I
adjure thee by the living God that thou tell us if thou be the Christ
the Son of God

2664 Jesus saith to him Thou hast said it Nevertheless I say to
you hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand
of the power of God and coming in the clouds of heaven

2665 Then the high priest rent his garments saying He hath
blasphemed What further need have we of witnesses Behold now you
have heard the blasphemy

2666 What think you But they answering said He is guilty of death

2667 Then did they spit in his face and buffeted him And others
struck his face with the palms of their hands

2668 Saying Prophesy unto us O Christ Who is he that struck thee

2669 But Peter sat without in the court And there came to him a
servant maid saying Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilean

2670 But he denied before them all saying I know not what thou
sayest

2671 And as he went out of the gate another maid saw him and she
saith to them that were there This man also was with Jesus of
Nazareth

2672 And again he denied with an oath I know not the man

2673 And after a little while they came that stood by and said to
Peter Surely thou also art one of them For even thy speech doth
discover thee

2674 Then he began to curse and to swear that he knew not the man
And immediately the cock crew

2675 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which he had said Before
the cock crow thou wilt deny me thrice And going forth he wept
bitterly



Matthew Chapter 27


The continuation of the history of the passion of Christ His death and
burial

271 And when morning was come all the chief priests and ancients of
the people took counsel against Jesus that they might put him to
death

272 And they brought him bound and delivered him to Pontius Pilate
the governor

273 Then Judas who betrayed him seeing that he was condemned
repenting himself brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the
chief priests and ancients

274 Saying I have sinned in betraying innocent blood But they said
What is that to us Look thou to it

275 And casting down the pieces of silver in the temple he departed
and went and hanged himself with an halter

276 But the chief priests having taken the pieces of silver said It
is not lawful to put them into the corbona because it is the price of
blood

Corbona  A place in the temple where the people put in their gifts or
offerings

277 And after they had consulted together they bought with them the
potters field to be a burying place for strangers

278 For this cause that field was called Haceldama that is the
field of blood even to this day

279 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet
saying And they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him
that was prized whom they prized of the children of Israel

2710 And they gave them unto the potters field as the Lord
appointed to me

2711 And Jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him
saying Art thou the king of the Jews Jesus saith to him Thou sayest
it

2712 And when he was accused by the chief priests and ancients he
answered nothing

2713 Then Pilate saith to him Dost not thou hear how great
testimonies they allege against thee

2714 And he answered him to never a word so that the governor
wondered exceedingly

2715 Now upon the solemn day the governor was accustomed to release
to the people one prisoner whom they would

2716 And he had then a notorious prisoner that was called Barabbas

2717 They therefore being gathered together Pilate said Whom will
you that I release to You Barabbas or Jesus that is called Christ

2718 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him

2719 And as he was sitting in the place of judgment his wife sent to
him saying Have thou nothing to do with that just man for I have
suffered many things this day in a dream because of him

2720 But the chief priests and ancients persuaded the people that
they should ask Barabbas and make Jesus away

2721 And the governor answering said to them Whether will you of
the two to be released unto you But they said Barabbas

2722 Pilate saith to them What shall I do then with Jesus that is
called Christ They say all Let him be crucified

2723 The governor said to them Why what evil hath he done But they
cried out the more saying Let him be crucified

2724 And Pilate seeing that he prevailed nothing but that rather a
tumult was made taking water washed his hands before the people
saying I am innocent of the blood of this just man Look you to it

2725 And the whole people answering said His blood be upon us and
upon our children

2726 Then he released to them Barabbas and having scourged Jesus
delivered him unto them to be crucified

2727 Then the soldiers of the governor taking Jesus into the hall
gathered together unto him the whole band

2728 And stripping him they put a scarlet cloak about him

2729 And platting a crown of thorns they put it upon his head and a
reed in his right hand And bowing the knee before him they mocked
him saying Hail King of the Jews

2730 And spitting upon him they took the reed and struck his head

2731 And after they had mocked him they took off the cloak from him
and put on him his own garments and led him away to crucify him

2732 And going out they found a man of Cyrene named Simon him they
forced to take up his cross

2733 And they came to the place that is called Golgotha which is the
place of Calvary

2734 And they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall And when he
had tasted he would not drink

2735 And after they had crucified him they divided his garments
casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the
prophet saying They divided my garments among them and upon my
vesture they cast lots

2736 And they sat and watched him

2737 And they put over his head his cause written THIS IS JESUS THE
KING OF THE JEWS

2738 Then were crucified with him two thieves one on the right hand
and one on the left

2739 And they that passed by blasphemed him wagging their heads

2740 And saying Vah thou that destroyest the temple of God and in
three days dost rebuild it save thy own self If thou be the Son of
God come down from the cross

2741 In like manner also the chief priests with the scribes and
ancients mocking said

2742 He saved others himself he cannot save If he be the king of
Israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him

2743 He trusted in God let him now deliver him if he will have him
For he said I am the Son of God

2744 And the selfsame thing the thieves also that were crucified with
him reproached him with

2745 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over the whole
earth until the ninth hour

2746 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying
Eli Eli lamma sabacthani That is My God My God why hast thou
forsaken me

2747 And some that stood there and heard said This man calleth
Elias

2748 And immediately one of them running took a sponge and filled it
with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink

2749 And the others said Let be Let us see whether Elias will come
to deliver him

2750 And Jesus again crying with a loud voice yielded up the ghost

2751 And behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top
even to the bottom and the earth quaked and the rocks were rent

2752 And the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints that
had slept arose

2753 And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection came into
the holy city and appeared to many

2754 Now the centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus
having seen the earthquake and the things that were done were sore
afraid saying Indeed this was the Son of God

2755 And there were there many women afar off who had followed Jesus
from Galilee ministering unto him

2756 Among whom was Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of James and
Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee

2757 And when it was evening there came a certain rich man of
Arimathea named Joseph who also himself was a disciple of Jesus

2758 He went to Pilate and asked the body of Jesus Then Pilate
commanded that the body should be delivered

2759 And Joseph taking the body wrapped it up in a clean linen cloth

2760 And laid it in his own new monument which he had hewed out in a
rock And he rolled a great stone to the door of the monument and went
his way

2761 And there was there Mary Magdalen and the other Mary sitting
over against the sepulchre

2762 And the next day which followed the day of preparation the
chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate

The day of preparation  The eve of the sabbath so called because on
that day they prepared all things necessary not being allowed so much
as to dress their meat on the sabbath day

2763 Saying Sir we have remembered that that seducer said while
he was yet alive After three days I will rise again

2764 Command therefore the sepulchre to be guarded until the third
day lest perhaps his disciples come and steal him away and say to the
people He is risen from the dead And the last error shall be worse
than the first

2765 Pilate saith to them You have a guard Go guard it as you
know

2766 And they departing made the sepulchre sure sealing the stone
and setting guards



Matthew Chapter 28


The resurrection of Christ His commission to his disciples

281 And in the end of the sabbath when it began to dawn towards the
first day of the week came Mary Magdalen and the other Mary to see
the sepulchre

282 And behold there was a great earthquake For an angel of the Lord
descended from heaven and coming rolled back the stone and sat upon it

283 And his countenance was as lightning and his raiment as snow

284 And for fear of him the guards were struck with terror and
became as dead men

285 And the angel answering said to the women Fear not you for I
know that you seek Jesus who was crucified

286 He is not here For he is risen as he said Come and see the
place where the Lord was laid

287 And going quickly tell ye his disciples that he is risen And
behold he will go before you into Galilee There you shall see him Lo
I have foretold it to you

288 And they went out quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great
joy running to tell his disciples

289 And behold Jesus met them saying All hail But they came up
and took hold of his feet and adored him

2810 Then Jesus said to them Fear not Go tell my brethren that
they go into Galilee There they shall see me

2811 Who when they were departed behold some of the guards came
into the city and told the chief priests all things that had been done

2812 And they being assembled together with the ancients taking
counsel gave a great sum of money to the soldiers

2813 Saying Say you His disciples came by night and stole him away
when we were asleep

2814 And if the governor shall hear of this we will persuade him and
secure you

2815 So they taking the money did as they were taught and this word
was spread abroad among the Jews even unto this day

2816 And the eleven disciples went into Galilee unto the mountain
where Jesus had appointed them

2817 And seeing him they adored but some doubted

2818 And Jesus coming spoke to them saying All power is given to
me in heaven and in earth

All power etc  See here the warrant and commission of the apostles
and their successors the bishops and pastors of Christs church He
received from his Father all power in heaven and in earth and in
virtue of this power he sends them even as his Father sent him St
John 20 21 to teach and disciple not one but all nations and
instruct them in all truths and that he may assist them effectually in
the execution of this commission he promises to be with them not for
three or four hundred years only but all days even to the
consummation of the world How then could the Catholic Church ever go
astray having always with her pastors as is here promised Christ
himself who is the way the truth and the life St John 14

2819 Going therefore teach ye all nations baptizing them in the
name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost

2820 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded
you And behold I am with you all days even to the consummation of the
world




THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST MARK



St Mark the disciple and interpreter of St Peter saith St Jerome
according to what he heard from Peter himself wrote at Rome a brief
Gospel at the request of the Brethren about ten years after our lords
Ascension which when Peter had heard he approved of it and with his
authority published it to the church to be read Baronius and others
say that the original was written in Latin but the more general
opinion is that the Evangelist wrote it in Greek



Mark Chapter 1


The preaching of John the Baptist Christ is baptized by him He calls
his disciples and works many miracles

11 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God

12 As it is written in Isaias the prophet Behold I send my angel
before thy face who shall prepare the way before thee

13 A voice of one crying in the desert Prepare ye the way of the
Lord make straight his paths

14 John was in the desert baptizing and preaching the baptism of
penance unto remission of sins

15 And there went out to him all the country of Judea and all they of
Jerusalem and were baptized by him in the river of Jordan confessing
their sins

16 And John was clothed camels hair and a leathern girdle about his
loins and he ate locusts and wild honey

17 And he preached saying There cometh after me one mightier than
I the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and loose

18 I have baptized you with water but he shall baptize you with the
Holy Ghost

19 And it came to pass in those days Jesus came from Nazareth of
Galilee and was baptized by John in Jordan

110 And forthwith coming up out of the water he saw the heavens open
and the Spirit as a dove descending and remaining on him

111 And there came a voice from heaven Thou art my beloved Son in
thee I am well pleased

112 And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the desert

113 And he was in the desert forty days and forty nights and was
tempted by Satan And he was with beasts and the angels ministered to
him

114 And after that John was delivered up Jesus came in Galilee
preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God

115 And saying The time is accomplished and the kingdom of God is at
hand Repent and believe the gospel

116 And passing by the sea of Galilee he saw Simon and Andrew his
brother casting nets into the sea for they were fishermen

117 And Jesus said to them Come after me and I will make you to
become fishers of men

118 And immediately leaving their nets they followed him

119 And going on from thence a little farther he saw James the son
of Zebedee and John his brother who also were mending their nets in
the ship

120 And forthwith he called them And leaving their father Zebedee in
the ship with his hired men they followed him

121 And they entered into Capharnaum and forthwith upon the sabbath
days going into the synagogue he taught them

122 And they were astonished at his doctrine For he was teaching
them as one having power and not as the scribes

123 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit
and he cried out

124 Saying What have we to do with thee Jesus of Nazareth Art thou
come to destroy us I know who thou art the Holy One of God

125 And Jesus threatened him saying Speak no more and go out of
the man

126 And the unclean spirit tearing him and crying out with a loud
voice went out of him

127 And they were all amazed insomuch that they questioned among
themselves saying What thing is this What is this new doctrine For
with power he commandeth even the unclean spirits and they obey him

128 And the fame of him was spread forthwith into all the country of
Galilee

129 And immediately going out of the synagogue they came into the
house of Simon and Andrew with James and John

130 And Simons wifes mother lay in a fit of a fever and forthwith
they tell him of her

131 And coming to her he lifted her up taking her by the hand and
immediately the fever left her and she ministered unto them

132 And when it was evening after sunset they brought to him all
that were ill and that were possessed with devils

133 And all the city was gathered together at the door

134 And he healed many that were troubled with divers diseases And
he cast out many devils and he suffered them not to speak because
they knew him

135 And rising very early going out he went into a desert place
and there he prayed

136 And Simon and they that were with him followed after him

137 And when they had found him they said to him All seek for thee

138 And he saith to them Let us go into the neighbouring towns and
cities that I may preach there also for to this purpose am I come

139 And he was preaching in their synagogues and in all Galilee and
casting out devils

140 And there came a leper to him beseeching him and kneeling down
said to him If thou wilt thou canst make me clean

141 And Jesus having compassion on him stretched forth his hand and
touching him saith to him I will Be thou made clean

142 And when he had spoken immediately the leprosy departed from
him and he was made clean

143 And he strictly charged him and forthwith sent him away

144 And he saith to him See thou tell no one but go shew thyself
to the high priest and offer for thy cleansing the things that Moses
commanded for a testimony to them

145 But he being gone out began to publish and to blaze abroad the
word so that he could not openly go into the city but was without in
desert places And they flocked to him from all sides



Mark Chapter 2


Christ heals the sick of the palsy He calls Matthew and excuses his
disciples

21 And again he entered into Capharnaum after some days

22 And it was heard that he was in the house And many came together
so that there was no room no not even at the door And he spoke to
them the word

23 And they came to him bringing one sick of the palsy who was
carried by four

24 And when they could not offer him unto him for the multitude they
uncovered the roof where he was and opening it they let down the bed
wherein the man sick of the palsy lay

25 And when Jesus had seen their faith he saith to the sick of the
palsy Son thy sins are forgiven thee

26 And there were some of the scribes sitting there and thinking in
their hearts

27 Why doth this man speak thus He blasphemeth Who can forgive
sins but God only

28 Which Jesus presently knowing in his spirit that they so thought
within themselves saith to them Why think you these things in your
hearts

29 Which is easier to say to the sick of the palsy Thy sins are
forgiven thee or to say Arise take up thy bed and walk

210 But that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to
forgive sins he saith to the sick of the palsy

211 I say to thee Arise Take up thy bed and go into thy house

212 And immediately he arose and taking up his bed went his way in
the sight of all so that all wondered and glorified God saying We
never saw the like

213 And he went forth again to the sea side and all the multitude
came to him And he taught them

214 And when he was passing by he saw Levi the son of Alpheus
sitting at the receipt of custom and he saith to him Follow me And
rising up he followed him

215 And it came to pass as he sat at meat in his house many
Publicans and sinners sat down together with Jesus and his disciples
For they with Jesus who also followed him For they were many who
also followed him

216 And the scribes and the Pharisees seeing that he ate with
publicans and sinners said to his disciples Why doth your master eat
and drink with publicans and sinners

217 Jesus hearing this saith to them They that are well have no
need of a physician but they that are sick For I came not to call the
just but sinners

218 And the disciples of John and the Pharisees used to fast And
they come and say to him Why do the disciples of John and of the
Pharisees fast but thy disciples do not fast

219 And Jesus saith to them Can the children of the marriage fast
as long as the bridegroom is with them As long as they have the
bridegroom with them they cannot fast

220 But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away
from them and then they shall fast in those days

221 No man seweth a piece of raw cloth to an old garment otherwise
the new piecing taketh away from the old and there is made a greater
rent

222 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles otherwise the wine
will burst the bottles and both the wine will be spilled and the
bottles will be lost But new wine must be put into new bottles

223 And it came to pass again as the Lord walked through the corn
fields on the sabbath that his disciples began to go forward and to
pluck the ears of corn

224 And the Pharisees said to him Behold why do they on the sabbath
day that which is not lawful

225 And he said to them Have you never read what David did when he
had need and was hungry himself and they that were with him

226 How he went into the house of God under Abiathar the high
priest and did eat the loaves of proposition which was not lawful to
eat but for the priests and gave to them who were with him

227 And he said to them The sabbath was made for man and not man
for the sabbath

228 Therefore the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath also



Mark Chapter 3


Christ heals the withered hand He chooses the twelve He confutes the
blasphemy of the Pharisees

31 And he entered again into the synagogue and there was a man there
who had a withered hand

32 And they watched him whether he would heal on the sabbath days
that they might accuse him

33 And he said to the man who had the withered hand Stand up in the
midst

34 And he saith to them Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days
or to do evil To save life or to destroy But they held their peace

35 And looking round about on them with anger being grieved for the
blindness of their hearts he saith to the man Stretch forth thy hand
And he stretched it forth and his hand was restored unto him

36 And the Pharisees going out immediately made a consultation with
the Herodians against him how they might destroy him

37 But Jesus retired with his disciples to the sea and a great
multitude followed him from Galilee and Judea

38 And from Jerusalem and from Idumea and from beyond the Jordan
And they about Tyre and Sidon a great multitude hearing the things
which he did came to him

39 And he spoke to his disciples that a small ship should wait on
him because of the multitude lest they should throng him

310 For he healed many so that they pressed upon him for to touch
him as many as had evils

311 And the unclean spirits when they saw him fell down before him
and they cried saying

312 Thou art the Son of God And he strictly charged them that they
should not make him known

313 And going up into a mountain he called unto him whom he would
himself and they came to him

314 And he made that twelve should be with him and that he might
send them to preach

315 And he gave them power to heal sicknesses and to cast out
devils

316 And to Simon he gave the name Peter

317 And James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James and
he named them Boanerges which is The sons of thunder

318 And Andrew and Philip and Bartholomew and Matthew and Thomas
and James of Alpheus and Thaddeus and Simon the Cananean

319 And Judas Iscariot who also betrayed him

320 And they come to a house and the multitude cometh together
again so that they could not so much as eat bread

321 And when his friends had heard of it they went out to lay hold
on him For they said He is become mad

322 And the scribes who were come down from Jerusalem said He hath
Beelzebub and by the prince of devils he casteth out devils

323 And after he had called them together he said to them in
parables How can Satan cast out Satan

324 And if a kingdom be divided against itself that kingdom cannot
stand

325 And if a house be divided against itself that house cannot
stand

326 And if Satan be risen up against himself he is divided and
cannot stand but hath an end

327 No man can enter into the house of a strong man and rob him of
his goods unless he first bind the strong man and then shall he
plunder his house

328 Amen I say to you that all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons
of men and the blasphemies wherewith they shall blaspheme

329 But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost shall never
have forgiveness but shall be guilty of an everlasting sin

330 Because they said He hath an unclean spirit

331 And his mother and his brethren came and standing without sent
unto him calling him

332 And the multitude sat about him and they say to him Behold thy
mother and thy brethren without seek for thee

333 And answering them he said Who is my mother and my brethren

334 And looking round about on them who sat about him he saith
Behold my mother and my brethren

335 For whosoever shall do the will of God he is my brother and my
sister and mother



Mark Chapter 4


The parable of the sower Christ stills the tempest at sea

41 And again he began to teach by the sea side and a great multitude
was gathered together unto him so that he went up into a ship and sat
in the sea and all the multitude was upon the land by the sea side

42 And he taught them many things in parables and said unto them in
his doctrine

43 Hear ye Behold the sower went out to sow

44 And whilst he sowed some fell by the way side and the birds of
the air came and ate it up

45 And other some fell upon stony ground where it had not much
earth and it shot up immediately because it had no depth of earth

46 And when the sun was risen it was scorched and because it had no
root it withered away

47 And some fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it
and it yielded no fruit

48 And some fell upon good ground and brought forth fruit that grew
up and increased and yielded one thirty another sixty and another a
hundred

49 And he said He that hath ears to hear let him hear

410 And when he was alone the twelve that were with him asked him
the parable

411 And he said to them To you it is given to know the mystery of
the kingdom of God but to them that are without all things are done
in parables

412 That seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may
hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted
and their sins should be forgiven them

That seeing they may see etc  in punishment of their wilfully
shutting their eyes St Matt 13 15 God justly withdrew those
lights and graces which otherwise he would have given them for their
effectual conversion

413 And he saith to them Are you ignorant of this parable and how
shall you know all parables

414 He that soweth soweth the word

415 And these are they by the way side where the word is sown and
as soon as they have heard immediately Satan cometh and taketh away
the word that was sown in their hearts

416 And these likewise are they that are sown on the stony ground
who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with joy

417 And they have no root in themselves but are only for a time and
then when tribulation and persecution ariseth for the word they are
presently scandalized

418 And others there are who are sown among thorns these are they
that hear the word

419 And the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and
the lusts after other things entering in choke the word and it is made
fruitless

420 And these are they who are sown upon the good ground who hear
the word and receive it and yield fruit the one thirty another
sixty and another a hundred

421 And he said to them Doth a candle come in to be put under a
bushel or under a bed and not to be set on a candlestick

422 For there is nothing hid which shall not be made manifest
neither was it made secret but that it may come abroad

423 If any man have ears to hear let him hear

424 And he said to them Take heed what you hear In what measure you
shall mete it shall be measured to you again and more shall be given
to you

425 For he that hath to him shall be given and he that hath not
that also which he hath shall be taken away from him

426 And he said So is the kingdom of God as if a man should cast
seed into the earth

427 And should sleep and rise night and day and the seed should
spring and grow up whilst he knoweth not

428 For the earth of itself bringeth forth fruit first the blade
then the ear afterwards the full corn in the ear

429 And when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth in
the sickle because the harvest is come

430 And he said To what shall we liken the kingdom of God or to
what parable shall we compare it

431 It is as a grain of mustard seed which when it is sown in the
earth is less than all the seeds that are in the earth

432 And when it is sown it groweth up and becometh greater than all
herbs and shooteth out great branches so that the birds of the air
may dwell under the shadow thereof

433 And with many such parables he spoke to them the word according
as they were able to hear

434 And without parable he did not speak unto them but apart he
explained all things to his disciples

435 And he saith to them that day when evening was come Let us pass
over to the other side

436 And sending away the multitude they take him even as he was in
the ship and there were other ships with him

437 And there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into
the ship so that the ship was filled

438 And he was in the hinder part of the ship sleeping upon a
pillow and they awake him and say to him Master doth it not
concern thee that we perish

439 And rising up he rebuked the wind and said to the sea Peace
be still And the wind ceased and there was made a great calm

440 And he said to them Why are you fearful have you not faith yet
And they feared exceedingly and they said one to another Who is this
thinkest thou that both wind and sea obey him



Mark Chapter 5


Christ casts out a legion of devils he heals the issue of blood and
raises the daughter of Jairus to life

51 And they came over the strait of the sea into the country of the
Gerasens

52 And as he went out of the ship immediately there met him out of
the monuments a man with an unclean spirit

53 Who had his dwelling in the tombs and no man now could bind him
not even with chains

54 For having been often bound with fetters and chains he had burst
the chains and broken the fetters in pieces and no one could tame
him

55 And he was always day and night in the monuments and in the
mountains crying and cutting himself with stones

56 And seeing Jesus afar off he ran and adored him

57 And crying with a loud voice he said What have I to do with
thee Jesus the Son of the most high God I adjure thee by God that
thou torment me not

58 For he said unto him Go out of the man thou unclean spirit

59 And he asked him What is thy name And he saith to him My name
is Legion for we are many

510 And he besought him much that he would not drive him away out of
the country

511 And there was there near the mountain a great herd of swine
feeding

512 And the spirits besought him saying Send us into the swine
that we may enter into them

513 And Jesus immediately gave them leave And the unclean spirits
going out entered into the swine and the herd with great violence was
carried headlong into the sea being about two thousand were stifled
in the sea

514 And they that fed them fled and told it in the city and in the
fields And they went out to see what was done

515 And they came to Jesus and they see him that was troubled with
the devil sitting clothed and well in his wits and they were
afraid

516 And they that had seen it told them in what manner he had been
dealt with who had the devil and concerning the swine

517 And they began to pray him that he would depart from their
coasts

518 And when he went up into the ship he that had been troubled with
the devil began to beseech him that he might be with him

519 And he admitted him not but saith him Go into thy house to thy
friends and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee
and hath had mercy thee

520 And he went his way and began to publish in Decapolis how great
things Jesus had done for him and all men wondered

521 And when Jesus had passed again in the ship over the strait a
great multitude assembled together unto him and he was nigh unto the
sea

522 And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue named Jairus
and seeing him falleth down at his feet

523 And he besought him much saying My daughter is at the point of
death come lay thy hand upon her that she may be safe and may live

524 And he went with him and a great multitude followed him and
they thronged him

525 And a woman who was under an issue of blood twelve years

526 And had suffered many things from many physicians and had spent
all that she had and was nothing the better but rather worse

527 When she had heard of Jesus came in the crowd behind him and
touched his garment

528 For she said If I shall touch but his garment I shall be whole

529 And forthwith the fountain of her blood was dried up and she
felt in her body that she was healed of the evil

530 And immediately Jesus knowing in himself the virtue that had
proceeded from him turning to the multitude said Who hath touched my
garments

531 And his disciples said to him Thou seest the multitude thronging
thee and sayest thou who hath touched me

532 And he looked about to see her who had done this

533 But the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in
her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth

534 And he said to her Daughter thy faith hath made thee whole go
in peace and be thou whole of thy disease

535 While he was yet speaking some come from the ruler of the
synagogues house saying Thy daughter is dead why dost thou trouble
the master any further

536 But Jesus having heard the word that was spoken saith to the
ruler of the synagogue Fear not only believe

537 And he admitted not any man to follow him but Peter and James
and John the brother of James

538 And they cone to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and he
seeth a tumult and people weeping and wailing much

539 And going in he saith to them Why make you this ado and weep
the damsel is not dead but sleepeth

540 And they laughed him to scorn But he having put them all out
taketh the father and the mother of the damsel and them that were with
him and entereth in where the damsel was lying

541 And taking the damsel by the hand he saith to her Talitha cumi
which is being interpreted Damsel I say to thee arise

542 And immediately the damsel rose up and walked and she was
twelve years old and they were astonished with a great astonishment

543 And he charged them strictly that no man should know it and
commanded that something should be given her to eat



Mark Chapter 6


Christ teaches at Nazareth he sends forth the twelve apostles he
feeds five thousand with five loaves and walks upon the sea

61 And going out from thence he went into his own country and his
disciples followed him

62 And when the Sabbath was come he began to teach in the synagogue
and many hearing him were in admiration at his doctrine saying How
came this man by all these things and what wisdom is this that is
given to him and such mighty works as are wrought by his hands

63 Is not this the carpenter the son of Mary the brother of James
and Joseph and Jude and Simon are not also his sisters here with us
And they were scandalized in regard of him

64 And Jesus said to them A prophet is not without honour but in
his own country and in his own house and among his own kindred

65 And he could not do any miracles there only that he cured a few
that were sick laying his hands upon them

He could not  Not for want of power but because he would not work
miracles in favour of obstinate and incredulous people who were
unworthy of such favours

66 And he wondered because of their unbelief and he went through the
villages round about teaching

67 And he called the twelve and began to send them two and two and
gave them power over unclean spirits

68 And he commanded them that they should take nothing for the way
but a staff only no scrip no bread nor money in their purse

69 But to be shod with sandals and that they should not put on two
coats

610 And he said to them Wheresoever you shall enter into an house
there abide till you depart from that place

611 And whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you going forth
from thence shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony to them

612 And going forth they preached men should do penance

613 And they cast out many devils and anointed with oil many that
were sick and healed them

614 And king Herod heard for his name was made manifest and he
said John the Baptist is risen again from dead and therefore mighty
works shew forth themselves in him

615 And others said It is Elias But others said It is a prophet
as one of the prophets

616 Which Herod hearing said John whom I beheaded he is risen
again from the dead

617 For Herod himself had sent and apprehended John and bound him
prison for the sake of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother because
he had married her

618 For John said to Herod It is not lawful for thee to have thy
brothers wife

619 Now Herodias laid snares for him and was desirous to put him to
death and could not

620 For Herod feared John knowing him to be a just and holy man and
kept him and when he heard him did many things and he heard him
willingly

And kept him  That is from the designs of Herodias and for fear of
the people would not put him to death though she sought it and
through her daughter she effected her wish

621 And when a convenient day was come Herod made a supper for his
birthday for the princes and tribunes and chief men of Galilee

622 And when the daughter of the same Herodias had come in and had
danced and pleased Herod and them that were at table with him the
king said to the damsel Ask of me what thou wilt and I will give it
thee

623 And he swore to her Whatsoever thou shalt ask I will give thee
though it be the half of my kingdom

624 Who when she was gone out said to her mother What shall I ask
But her mother said The head of John the Baptist

625 And when she was come in immediately with haste to the king she
asked saying I will that forthwith thou give me in a dish the head
of John the Baptist

626 And the king was struck sad Yet because of his oath and because
of them that were with him at table he would not displease her

627 But sending an executioner he commanded that his head should be
brought in a dish

628 And he beheaded him in the prison and brought his head in a
dish and gave to the damsel and the damsel gave it her mother

629 Which his disciples hearing came and took his body and laid it
in a tomb

630 And the apostles coming together unto Jesus related to him all
things that they had done and taught

631 And he said to them Come apart into a desert place and rest a
little For there were many coming and going and they had not so much
as time to eat

632 And going up into a ship they went into a desert place apart

633 And they saw them going away and many knew and they ran
flocking thither foot from all the cities and were there before them

634 And Jesus going out saw a great multitude and he had compassion
on them because they were as sheep not having a shepherd and he began
to teach them many things

635 And when the day was now far spent his disciples came to him
saying This is a desert place and the hour is now past

636 Send them away that going into the next villages and towns they
may buy themselves meat to eat

637 And he answering said to them Give you them to eat And they
said to him Let us go and buy bread for two hundred pence and we will
give them to eat

638 And he saith to them How many loaves have you go and see And
when they knew they say Five and two fishes

639 And he commanded them that they should make them all sit down by
companies upon the green grass

640 And they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties

641 And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes
looking up to heaven he blessed and broke the loaves and gave to his
disciples to set before them and the two fishes he divided among them
all

642 And they all did eat and had their fill

643 And they took up the leavings twelve full baskets of fragments
and of the fishes

644 And they that did eat were five thousand men

645 And immediately he obliged his disciples to go up into the ship
that they might go before him over the water to Bethsaida whilst he
dismissed the people

646 And when he had dismissed them he went up to the mountain to
pray

647 And when it was late the ship was in the midst of the sea and
himself alone on the land

648 And seeing them labouring in rowing for the wind was against
them and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh to them
walking upon the sea and he would have passed by them

649 But they seeing him walking upon the sea thought it was an
apparition and they cried out

650 For they all saw him and were troubled bled And immediately he
spoke with them and said to them Have a good heart it is I fear ye
not

651 And he went up to them into the ship and the wind ceased and
they were far more astonished within themselves

652 For they understood not concerning the loaves for their heart
was blinded

653 And when they had passed over they came into the land of
Genezareth and set to the shore

654 And when they were gone out of the ship immediately they knew
him

655 And running through that whole country they began to carry about
in beds those that were sick where they heard he was

656 And whithersoever he entered into towns or into villages or
cities they laid the sick in the streets and besought him that they
might touch but the hem of his garment and as many as touched him were
made whole



Mark Chapter 7


Christ rebukes the Pharisees He heals the daughter of the woman of
Chanaan and the man that was deaf and dumb

71 And there assembled together unto him the Pharisees and some of
the scribes coming from Jerusalem

72 And when they had seen some of his disciples eat bread with
common that is with unwashed hands they found fault

73 For the Pharisees and all the Jews eat not without often washing
their hands holding the tradition of the ancients

74 And when they come from the market unless they be washed they
eat not and many other things there are that have been delivered to
them to observe the washings of cups and of pots and of brazen vessels
and of beds

75 And the Pharisees and scribes asked him Why do not thy disciples
walk according to the tradition of the ancients but they eat bread
with common hands

76 But he answering said to them Well did Isaias prophesy of you
hypocrites as it is written This people honoureth me with their lips
but their heart is far from me

77 And in vain do they worship me teaching doctrines and precepts of
men

Doctrines and precepts of men  See the annotations Matt 15 9 11

78 For leaving the commandment of God you hold the tradition of men
the washing of pots and of cups and many other things you do like to
these

79 And he said to them Well do you make void the commandment of God
that you may keep your own tradition

710 For Moses said Honour thy father and thy mother And He that
shall curse father or mother dying let him die

711 But you say If a man shall say to his father or mother Corban
which is a gift whatsoever is from me shall profit thee

712 And further you suffer him not to do any thing for his father or
mother

713 Making void the word of God by your own tradition which you have
given forth And many other such like things you do

714 And calling again the multitude unto him he said to them Hear
ye me all and understand

715 There is nothing from without a man that entering into him can
defile him But the things which come from a man those are they that
defile a man

716 If any man have ears to hear let him hear

717 And when he was come into the house from the multitude his
disciples asked him the parable

718 And he saith to them So are you also without knowledge
Understand you not that every thing from without entering into a man
cannot defile him

719 Because it entereth not into his heart but goeth into his belly
and goeth out into the privy purging all meats

720 But he said that the things which come out from a man they
defile a man

721 For from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts
adulteries fornications murders

722 Thefts covetousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness an evil
eye blasphemy pride foolishness

723 All these evil things come from within and defile a man

724 And rising from thence he went into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon
and entering into a house he would that no man should know it And he
could not be hid

725 For a woman as soon as she heard of him whose daughter had an
unclean spirit came in and fell down at his feet

726 For the woman was a Gentile a Syrophenician born And she
besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter

727 Who said to her suffer first the children to be filled for it
is not good to take the bread of the children and cast it to the dogs

728 But she answered and said to him Yea Lord for the whelps also
eat under the table of the crumbs of the children

729 And he said to her For this saying go thy way The devil is
gone out of thy daughter

730 And when she was come into her house she found the girl lying
upon the bed and that the devil was gone out

731 And again going out of the coasts of Tyre he came by Sidon to
the sea of Galilee through the midst the of the coasts of Decapolis

732 And they bring to him one deaf and dumb and they besought him
that he would lay his hand upon him

733 And taking him from the multitude apart he put his fingers into
his ears and spitting he touched his tongue

734 And looking up to heaven he groaned and said to him Ephpheta
which is Be thou opened

735 And immediately his ears were opened and the string of his tongue
was loosed and he spoke right

736 And he charged them that they should tell no man But the more he
charged them so much the more a great deal did they publish it

737 And so much the more did they wonder saying He hath done all
things well He hath made both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak



Mark Chapter 8


Christ feeds four thousand He gives sight to a blind man He foretells
his passion

81 In those days again when there was great multitude and they had
nothing to eat calling his disciples together he saith to them

82 I have compassion on the multitude for behold they have now been
with me three days and have nothing to eat

83 And if I shall send them away fasting to their home they will
faint in the way for some of them came from afar off

84 And his disciples answered him From whence can any one fill them
here with bread in the wilderness

85 And he asked them How many loaves have ye Who said Seven

86 And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground And taking
the seven loaves giving thanks he broke and gave to his disciples for
to set before them And they set them before the people

87 And they had a few little fishes and he blessed them and
commanded them to be set before them

88 And they did eat and were filled and they took up that which was
left of the fragments seven baskets

89 And they that had eaten were about four thousand And he sent them
away

810 And immediately going up into a ship with his disciples he came
into the parts of Dalmanutha

811 And the Pharisees came forth and began to question with him
asking him a sign from heaven tempting him

812 And sighing deeply in spirit he saith Why doth this generation
seek a sign Amen I say to you a sign shall not be given to this
generation

813 And leaving them he went up again into the ship and passed to
the other side of the water

814 And they forgot to take bread and they had but one loaf with
them in the ship

815 And he charged them saying Take heed and beware of the leaven of
the Pharisees and of the leaven of Herod

816 And they reasoned among themselves saying Because we have no
bread

817 Which Jesus knowing saith to them Why do you reason because
you have no bread Do you not yet know nor understand Have you still
your heart blinded

818 Having eyes see you not And having ears hear you not Neither
do you remember

819 When I broke the five loves among five thousand how many baskets
full of fragments took you up They say to him Twelve

820 When also the seven loaves among four thousand how many baskets
of fragments took you up And they say to him Seven

821 And he said to them How do you not yet understand

822 And they came to Bethsaida and they bring to him a blind man
And they besought him that he would touch him

823 And taking the blind man by the hand he led him out of the town
And spitting upon his eyes laying his hands on him he asked him if he
saw any thing

824 And looking up he said I see men as it were trees walking

825 After that again he laid his hands upon his eyes and he began to
see and was restored so that he saw all things clearly

826 And he sent him into his house saying Go into thy house and if
thou enter into the town tell nobody

827 And Jesus went out and his disciples into the towns of Caesarea
Philippi And in the way he asked his disciples saying to them Whom
do men say that I am

828 Who answered him saying John the Baptist but some Elias and
others as one of the prophets

829 Then he saith to them But whom do you say that I am Peter
answering said to him Thou art the Christ

830 And he strictly charged them that they should not tell any man of
him

831 And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many
things and be rejected by the ancients and by the high priests and the
scribes and be killed and after three days rise again

832 And he spoke the word openly And Peter taking him began to
rebuke him

833 Who turning about and seeing his disciples threatened Peter
saying Go behind me Satan because thou savourest not the things that
are of God but that are of men

834 And calling the multitude together with his disciples he said to
them If any man will follow me let him deny himself and take up his
cross and follow me

835 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever
shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel shall save it

836 For what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and
suffer the loss of his soul

837 Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul

838 For he that shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this
adulterous and sinful generation the Son of man also will be ashamed
of him when he shall come in the glory of his Father with the holy
angels

839 And he said to them Amen f say to you that there are some of
them that stand here who shall not taste death till they see the
kingdom of God coming in power



Mark Chapter 9


Christ is transfigured He casts out the dumb spirit He teaches
humility and to avoid scandal

91 And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter and James and
John and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves
and was transfigured before them

92 And his garments became shining and exceeding white as snow so as
no fuller upon earth can make white

93 And there appeared to them Elias with Moses and they were talking
with Jesus

94 And Peter answering said to Jesus Rabbi it is good for us to be
here And let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for
Moses and one for Elias

95 For he knew not what he said for they were struck with fear

96 And there was a cloud overshadowing them And a voice came out of
the cloud saying This is my most beloved Son Hear ye him

97 And immediately looking about they saw no man any more but Jesus
only with them

98 And as they came down from the mountain he charged them not to
tell any man what things they had seen till the Son of man shall be
risen again from the dead

99 And they kept the word to themselves questioning together what
that should mean when he shall be risen from the dead

910 And they asked him saying Why then do the Pharisees and scribes
say that Elias must come first

911 Who answering said to then Elias when he shall come first
shall restore all things and as it is written of the Son of man that
he must suffer many things and be despised

912 But I say to you that Elias also is come and they have done to
him whatsoever they would as it is written of him

913 And coming to his disciples he saw a great multitude about them
and the scribes disputing with them

914 And presently all the people seeing Jesus were astonished and
struck with fear and running to him they saluted him

915 And he asked them What do you question about among you

916 And one of the multitude answering said Master I have brought
my son to thee having a dumb spirit

917 Who wheresoever he taketh him dasheth him and he foameth and
gnasheth with the teeth and pineth away And I spoke to thy disciples
to cast him out and they could not

918 Who answering them said O incredulous generation how long
shall I be with you How long shall I suffer you Bring him unto me

919 And they brought him And when he had seen him immediately the
spirit troubled him and being thrown down upon the ground he rolled
about foaming

920 And he asked his father How long time is it since this hath
happened unto him But he sad From his infancy

921 And oftentimes hath he cast him into the fire and into the waters
to destroy him But if thou canst do any thing help us having
compassion on us

922 And Jesus saith to him If thou canst believe all things are
possible to him that believeth

923 And immediately the father of the boy crying out with tears
said I do believe Lord Help my unbelief

924 And when Jesus saw the multitude running together he threatened
the unclean spirit saying to him Deaf and dumb spirit I command
thee go out of him and enter not any more into him

925 And crying out and greatly tearing him he went our of him And
he became as dead so that many said He is dead

926 But Jesus taking him by the hand lifted him up And he arose

927 And when he was come into the house his disciples secretly asked
him Why could not we cast him out

928 And he said to them This kind can go out by nothing but by
prayer and fasting

929 And departing from thence they passed through Galilee and he
would not that any man should know it

930 And he taught his disciples and said to them The Son of man
shall be betrayed into the hands of men and they shall kill him and
after that he is killed he shall rise again the third day

931 But they understood not the word and they were afraid to ask
him

932 And they came to Capharnaum And when they were in the house he
asked them What did you treat of in the way

933 But they held their peace for in the way they had disputed among
themselves which of them should be the greatest

934 And sitting down he called the twelve and saith to them If any
man desire to be first he shall be the last of all and be minister of
all

935 And taking a child he set him in the midst of them Whom when he
had embraced he saith to them

936 Whosoever shall receive one such child as this in my name
receiveth me And whosoever shall receive me receiveth not me but him
that sent me

937 John answered him saying Master we saw one casting out devils
in thy name who followeth not us and we forbade him

938 But Jesus said Do not forbid him For there is no man that doth
a miracle in my name and can soon speak ill of me

939 For he that is not against you is for you

940 For whosoever shall give you to drink a cup of water in my name
because you belong to Christ amen I say to you he shall not lose his
reward

941 And whosoever shall scandalize one of these little ones that
believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged
about his neck and he were cast into the sea

942 And if thy hand scandalize thee cut it off it is better for
thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell
into unquenchable fire

943 Where their worm dieth not and the fire is not extinguished

944 And if thy foot scandalize thee cut it off it is better for
thee to enter lame into life everlasting than having two feet to be
cast into the hell of unquenchable fire

945 Where their worm dieth not and the fire is not extinguished

946 And if thy eye scandalize thee pluck it out it is better for
thee with one eye to enter into the kingdom of God than having two eyes
to be cast into the hell of fire

947 Where their worm dieth not and the fire is not extinguished

948 For every one shall be salted with fire and every victim shall
be salted with salt

949 Salt is good But if the salt become unsavoury wherewith will
you season it Have salt in you and have peace among you



Mark Chapter 10


Marriage is not to be dissolved The danger of riches The ambition of
the sons of Zebedee A blind man is restored to his sight

101 And rising up from thence he cometh into the coast of Judea
beyond the Jordan and the multitude flocked to him again And as he
was accustomed he taught them again

102 And the Pharisees coming to him asked him tempting him Is it
lawful for a man to put away his wife

103 But he answering saith to them What did Moses command you

104 Who said Moses permitted to write a bill of divorce and to put
her away

105 To whom Jesus answering said Because of the hardness of your
heart he wrote you that precept

106 But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and
female

107 For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall
cleave to his wife

108 And they two shall be in one flesh Therefore now they are not
two but one flesh

109 What therefore God hath joined together let no man put asunder

1010 And in the house again his disciples asked him concerning the
same thing

1011 And he saith to them Whosoever shall put away his wife and
marry another committeth adultery against her

1012 And if the wife shall put away her husband and be married to
another she committeth adultery

1013 And they brought to him young children that he might touch
them And the disciples rebuked them that brought them

1014 Whom when Jesus saw he was much displeased and saith to them
Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of
such is the kingdom of God

1015 Amen I say to you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of
God as a little child shall not enter into it

1016 And embracing them and laying his hands upon them he blessed
them

1017 And when he was gone forth into the way a certain man running
up and kneeling before him asked him Good Master what shall I do
that I may receive life everlasting

1018 And Jesus said to him Why callest thou me good None is good
but one that is God

None is good  Of himself entirely and essentially but God alone men
may be good also but only by participation of Gods goodness

1019 Thou knowest the commandments Do not commit adultery do not
kill do not steal bear not false witness do no fraud honour thy
father and mother

1020 But he answering said to him Master all these things I have
observed from my youth

1021 And Jesus looking on him loved him and said to him One thing
is wanting unto thee Go sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the
poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven And come follow me

1022 Who being struck sad at that saying went away sorrowful for he
had great possessions

1023 And Jesus looking round about saith to his disciples How
hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God

1024 And the disciples were astonished at his words But Jesus again
answering saith to them Children how hard is it for them that trust
in riches to enter into the kingdom of God

1025 It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle
than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God

1026 Who wondered the more saying among themselves Who then can be
saved

1027 And Jesus looking on them saith with men it is impossible but
not with God For all things are possible with God

1028 And Peter began to say unto him Behold we have left all things
and have followed thee

1029 Jesus answering said Amen I say to you there is no man who
hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or children
or lands for my sake and for the gospel

1030 Who shall not receive an hundred times as much now in this
time houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and
lands with persecutions and in the world to come life everlasting

1031 But many that are first shall be last and the last first

1032 And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem and Jesus went
before them And they were astonished and following were afraid And
taking again the twelve he began to tell them the things that should
befall him

1033 Saying Behold we go up to Jerusalem and the Son of man shall
be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes and ancients And
they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the Gentiles

1034 And they shall mock him and spit on him and scourge him and kill
him and the third day he shall rise again

1035 And James and John the sons of Zebedee come to him saying
Master we desire that whatsoever we shall ask thou wouldst do it for
us

1036 But he said to them What would you that I should do for you

1037 And they said Grant to us that we may sit one on thy right
hand and the other on thy left hand in thy glory

1038 And Jesus said to them You know not what you ask Can you drink
of the chalice that I drink of or be baptized with the baptism
wherewith I am baptized

1039 But they said to him We can And Jesus saith to them You
shall indeed drink of the chalice that I drink of and with the baptism
wherewith I am baptized you shall be baptized

1040 But to sit on my right hand or on my left is not mine to give to
you but to them for whom it is prepared

1041 And the ten hearing it began to be much displeased at James
and John

1042 But Jesus calling them saith to them You know that they who
seem to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them and their princes
have power over them

1043 But it is not so among you but whosoever will be greater shall
be your minister

1044 And whosoever will be first among you shall be the servant of
all

1045 For the Son of man also is not come to be ministered unto but
to minister and to give his life a redemption for many

1046 And they came to Jericho And as he went out of Jericho with his
disciples and a very great multitude Bartimeus the blind man the son
of Timeus sat by the way side begging

1047 Who when he had heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth began to
cry out and to say Jesus Son of David have mercy on me

1048 And many rebuked him that he might hold his peace but he cried
a great deal the more Son of David have mercy on me

1049 And Jesus standing still commanded him to be called And they
call the blind man saying to him Be of better comfort Arise he
calleth thee

1050 Who casting off his garment leaped up and came to him

1051 And Jesus answering said to him What wilt thou that I should
do to thee And the blind man said to him Rabboni That I may see

1052 And Jesus saith to him Go thy way Thy faith hath made thee
whole And immediately he saw and followed him in the way



Mark Chapter 11


Christ enters into Jerusalem upon an ass He curses the barren fig tree
and drives the buyers and sellers out of the temple

111 And when they were drawing near to Jerusalem and to Bethania at
the mount of Olives he sendeth two of his disciples

112 And saith to them Go into the village that is over against you
and immediately at your coming in thither you shall find a colt tied
upon which no man yet hath sat Loose him and bring him

113 And if any man shall say to you What are you doing Say ye that
the Lord hath need of him And immediately he will let him come hither

114 And going their way they found the colt tied before the gate
without in the meeting of two ways And they loose him

115 And some of them that stood there said to them What do you
loosing the colt

116 Who said to them as Jesus had commanded them And they let him go
with them

117 And they brought the colt to Jesus And they lay their garments
on him and he sat upon him

118 And many spread their garments in the way and others cut down
boughs from the trees and strewed them in the way

119 And they that went before and they that followed cried saying
Hosanna Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord

1110 Blessed be the kingdom of our father David that cometh Hosanna
in the highest

1111 And he entered into Jerusalem into the temple and having
viewed all things round about when now the eventide was come he went
out to Bethania with the twelve

1112 And the next day when they came out from Bethania he was
hungry

1113 And when he had seen afar off a fig tree having leaves he came
if perhaps he might find any thing on it And when he was come to it
he found nothing but leaves For it was not the time for figs

1114 And answering he said to it May no man hereafter eat fruit of
thee any more for ever And his disciples heard it

1115 And they came to Jerusalem And when he was entered into the
temple he began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple
and over threw the tables of the moneychangers and the chairs of them
that sold doves

1116 And he suffered not that any man should carry a vessel through
the temple

1117 And he taught saying to them Is it not written My house shall
be called the house of prayer to all nations but you have made it a
den of thieves

1118 Which when the chief priests and the scribes had heard they
sought how they might destroy him For they feared him because the
whole multitude was in admiration at his doctrine

1119 And when evening was come he went forth out of the city

1120 And when they passed by in the morning they saw the fig tree
dried up from the roots

1121 And Peter remembering said to him Rabbi behold the fig tree
which thou didst curse is withered away

1122 And Jesus answering saith to them Have the faith of God

1123 Amen I say to you that whosoever shall say to this mountain Be
thou removed and be cast into the sea and shall not stagger in his
heart but be believe that whatsoever he saith shall be done it shall
be done unto him

1124 Therefore I say unto you all things whatsoever you ask when ye
pray believe that you shall receive and they shall come unto you

1125 And when you shall stand to pray forgive if you have aught
against any man that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive
you your sins

1126 But if you will not forgive neither will your father that is in
heaven forgive you your sins

1127 And they come again to Jerusalem And when he was walking in the
temple there come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the
ancients

1128 And they say to him By what authority dost thou these things
And who hath given thee this authority that thou shouldst do these
things

1129 And Jesus answering said to them I will also ask you one word
And answer you me and I will tell you by what authority I do these
things

1130 The baptism of John was it from heaven or from men Answer me

1131 But they thought with themselves saying If we say From
heaven he will say Why then did you not believe him

1132 If we say From men we fear the people For all men counted
John that he was a prophet indeed

1133 And they answering say to Jesus We know not And Jesus
answering saith to them Neither do I tell you by what authority I do
these things



Mark Chapter 12


The parable of the vineyard and husbandmen Caesars right to tribute
The Sadducees are confuted The first commandment The widows mite

121 And he began to speak to them in parables A certain man planted
a vineyard and made a hedge about it and dug a place for the winefat
and built a tower and let it to husbandmen and went into a far
country

122 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant to receive
of the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard

123 Who having laid hands on him beat and sent him away empty

124 And again he sent to them another servant and him they wounded
in the head and used him reproachfully

125 And again he sent another and him they killed and many others
of whom some they beat and others they killed

126 Therefore having yet one son most dear to him he also sent him
unto them last of all saying They will reverence my son

127 But the husbandmen said one to another This is the heir Come
let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours

128 And laying hold on him they killed him and cast him out of the
vineyard

129 What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do He will come and
destroy those husbandmen and will give the vineyard to others

1210 And have you not read this scripture The stone which the
builders rejected the same is made the head of the corner

1211 By the Lord has this been done and it is wonderful in our eyes

1212 And they sought to lay hands on him but they feared the people
For they knew that he spoke this parable to them And leaving him they
went their way

1213 And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians
that they should catch him in his words

1214 Who coming say to him Master we know that thou art a true
speaker and carest not for any man for thou regardest not the person
of men but teachest the way of God in truth Is it lawful to give
tribute to Caesar Or shall we not give it

1215 Who knowing their wiliness saith to them Why tempt you me
Bring me a penny that I may see it

1216 And they brought it him And he saith to them Whose is this
image and inscription They say to him Caesars

1217 And Jesus answering said to them Render therefore to Caesar
the things that are Caesars and to God the things that are Gods And
they marvelled at him

1218 And there came to him the Sadducees who say there is no
resurrection And they asked him saying

1219 Master Moses wrote unto us that if any mans brother die and
leave his wife behind him and leave no children his brother should
take his wife and raise up seed to his brother

1220 Now there were seven brethren and the first took a wife and
died leaving no issue

1221 And the second took her and died and neither did he leave any
issue And the third in like manner

1222 And the seven all took her in like manner and did not leave
issue Last of all the woman also died

1223 In the resurrection therefore when they shall rise again whose
wife shall she be of them For the seven had her to wife

1224 And Jesus answering saith to them Do ye not therefore err
because you know not the scriptures nor the power of God

1225 For when they shall rise again from the dead they shall neither
marry nor be married but are as the angels in heaven

1226 And as concerning the dead that they rise again have you not
read in the book of Moses how in the bush God spoke to him saying I
am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob

1227 He is not the God of the dead but of the living You therefore
do greatly err

1228 And there came one of the scribes that had heard them reasoning
together and seeing that he had answered them well asked him which
was the first commandment of all

1229 And Jesus answered him The first commandment of all is Hear O
Israel the Lord thy God is one God

1230 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart and
with thy whole soul and with thy whole mind and with thy whole
strength This is the first commandment

1231 And the second is like to it Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself There is no other commandment greater than these

1232 And the scribe said to him Well Master thou hast said in
truth that there is one God and there is no other besides him

1233 And that he should be loved with the whole heart and with the
whole understanding and with the whole soul and with the whole
strength And to love ones neighbour as ones self is a greater thing
than all holocausts and sacrifices

1234 And Jesus seeing that he had answered wisely said to him Thou
art not far from the kingdom of God And no man after that durst ask
him any question

1235 And Jesus answering said teaching in the temple How do the
scribes say that Christ is the son of David

1236 For David himself saith by the Holy Ghost The Lord said to my
Lord Sit on my right hand until I make thy enemies thy footstool

1237 David therefore himself calleth him Lord And whence is he then
his son And a great multitude heard him gladly

1238 And he said to them in his doctrine Beware of the scribes who
love to walk in long robes and to be saluted in the marketplace

1239 And to sit in the first chairs in the synagogues and to have the
highest places at suppers

1240 Who devour the houses of widows under the pretence of long
prayer These shall receive greater judgment

1241 And Jesus sitting over against the treasury beheld how the
people cast money into the treasury And many that were rich cast in
much

1242 And there came a certain poor widow and she cast in two mites
which make a farthing

1243 And calling his disciples together he saith to them Amen I say
to you this poor widow hath cast in more than all they who have cast
into the treasury

1244 For all they did cast in of their abundance but she of her want
cast in all she had even her whole living



Mark Chapter 13


Christ foretells the destruction of the temple and the signs that shall
forerun the day of judgment

131 And as he was going out of the temple one of his disciples said
to him Master behold what manner of stones and what buildings are
here

132 And Jesus answering said to him Seest thou all these great
buildings There shall not be left a stone upon a stone that shall not
be thrown down

133 And as he sat on the mount of Olivet over against the temple
Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him apart

134 Tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign
when all these things shall begin to be fulfilled

135 And Jesus answering began to say to them Take heed lest any man
deceive you

136 For many shall come in my name saying I am he and they shall
deceive many

137 And when you shall hear of wars and rumours of wars fear ye not
For such things must needs be but the end is not yet

138 For nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom
and there shall be earthquakes in divers places and famines These
things are the beginning of sorrows

139 But look to yourselves For they shall deliver you Up to
councils and in the synagogues you shall be beaten and you shall
stand before governors and kings for my sake for a testimony unto
them

1310 And unto all nations the gospel must first be preached

1311 And when they shall lead you and deliver you up be not
thoughtful beforehand what you shall speak but whatsoever shall be
given you in that hour that speak ye For it is not you that speak
but the Holy Ghost

1312 And the brother shall betray his brother unto death and the
father his son and children shall rise up against their parents and
shall work their death

1313 And you shall be hated by all men for my names sake But he
that shall endure unto the end he shall be saved

1314 And when you shall see the abomination of desolation standing
where it ought not he that readeth let him understand then let them
that are in Judea flee unto the mountains

1315 And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house
nor enter therein to take any thing out of the house

1316 And let him that shall be in the field not turn back to take up
his garment

1317 And woe to them that are with child and that give suck in those
days

1318 But pray ye that these things happen not in winter

1319 For in those days shall be such tribulations as were not from
the beginning of the creation which God created until now neither
shall be

1320 And unless the Lord had shortened the days no flesh should be
saved but for the sake of the elect which he hath chosen he hath
shortened the days

1321 And then if any man shall say to you Lo here is Christ Lo he
is here do not believe

1322 For there will rise up false Christs and false prophets and
they shall shew signs and wonders to seduce if it were possible even
the elect

1323 Take you heed therefore behold I have foretold you all things

1324 But in those days after that tribulation the sun shall be
darkened and the moon shall not give her light

1325 And the stars of heaven shall be falling down and the powers
that are in heaven shall be moved

1326 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds
with great power and glory

1327 And then shall he send his angels and shall gather together his
elect from the four winds from the uttermost part of the earth to the
uttermost part of heaven

1328 Now of the fig tree learn ye a parable When the branch thereof
is now tender and the leaves are come forth you know that summer is
very near

1329 So you also when you shall see these things come to pass know
ye that it is very nigh even at the doors

1330 Amen I say to you that this generation shall not pass until all
these things be done

1331 Heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass
away

1332 But of that day or hour no man knoweth neither the angels in
heaven nor the Son but the Father

Nor the Son  Not that the Son of God is absolutely ignorant of the
day of judgment but that he knoweth it not as our teacher that is
he knoweth it not so as to teach it to us as not being expedient

1333 Take ye heed watch and pray For ye know not when the time is

1334 Even as a man who going into a far country left his house and
gave authority to his servants over every work and commanded the porter
to watch

1335 Watch ye therefore for you know not when the lord of the house
cometh at even or at midnight or at the cock crowing or in the
morning

1336 Lest coming on a sudden he find you sleeping

1337 And what I say to you I say to all Watch



Mark Chapter 14


The first part of the history of the passion of Christ

141 Now the feast of the pasch and of the Azymes was after two days
and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might by some
wile lay hold on him and kill him

Azymes  That is the feast of the unleavened bread

142 But they said Not on the festival day lest there should be a
tumult among the people

143 And when he was in Bethania in the house of Simon the leper and
was at meat there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of
precious spikenard And breaking the alabaster box she poured it out
upon his head

144 Now there were some that had indignation within themselves and
said Why was this waste of the ointment made

145 For this ointment might have been sold for more than three
hundred pence and given to the poor And they murmured against her

146 But Jesus said Let her alone Why do You molest her She hath
wrought a good work upon me

147 For the poor you have always with you and whensoever you will
you may do them good but me you have not always

148 She hath done what she could she is come beforehand to anoint my
body for the burial

149 Amen I say to you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in
the whole world that also which she hath done shall be told for a
memorial of her

1410 And Judas Iscariot one of the twelve went to the chief
priests to betray him to them

1411 Who hearing it were glad and they promised him they would give
him money And he sought how he might conveniently betray him

1412 Now on the first day of the unleavened bread when they
sacrificed the pasch the disciples say to him Whither wilt thou that
we go and prepare for thee to eat the pasch

1413 And he sendeth two of his disciples and saith to them Go ye
into the city and there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of
water Follow him

1414 And whithersoever he shall go in say to the master of the
house The master saith Where is my refectory where I may eat the
pasch with my disciples

1415 And he will shew you a large dining room furnished And there
prepare ye for us

1416 And his disciples went their way and came into the city And
they found as he had told them and they prepared the pasch

1417 And when evening was come he cometh with the twelve

1418 And when they were at table and eating Jesus saith Amen I say
to you one of you that eateth with me shall betray me

1419 But they began to be sorrowful and to say to him one by one Is
it I

1420 Who saith to them One of the twelve who dippeth with me his
hand in the dish

1421 And the Son of man indeed goeth as it is written of him but
woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed It were
better for him if that man had not been born

1422 And whilst they were eating Jesus took bread and blessing
broke and gave to them and said Take ye This is my body

1423 And having taken the chalice giving thanks he gave it to them
And they all drank of it

1424 And he said to them This is my blood of the new testament
which shall be shed for many

1425 Amen I say to you that I will drink no more of the fruit of the
vine until that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God

1426 And when they had sung an hymn they went forth to the mount of
Olives

1427 And Jesus saith to them You will all be scandalized in my
regard this night For it is written I will strike the shepherd and
the sheep shall be dispersed

1428 But after I shall be risen again I will go before you into
Galilee

1429 But Peter saith to him Although all shall be scandalized in
thee yet not I

1430 And Jesus saith to him Amen I say to thee today even in this
night before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice

Crow twice  The cocks crow at two different times of the night viz
about midnight for the first time and then about the time commonly
called the cock crowing and this was the cock crowing our Saviour
spoke of and therefore the other Evangelists take no notice of the
first crowing

1431 But he spoke the more vehemently Although I should die together
with thee I will not deny thee And in like manner also said they all

1432 And they came to a farm called Gethsemani And he saith to his
disciples Sit you here while I pray

1433 And he taketh Peter and James and John with him and he began to
fear and to be heavy

1434 And he saith to them My soul is sorrowful even unto death Stay
you here and watch

1435 And when he was gone forward a little he fell flat on the
ground and he prayed that if it might be the hour might pass from
him

1436 And he saith Abba Father all things are possible to thee
remove this chalice from me but not what I will but what thou wilt

1437 And he cometh and findeth them sleeping And he saith to Peter
Simon sleepest thou Couldst thou not watch one hour

1438 Watch ye and pray that you enter not into temptation The
spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak

1439 And going away again he prayed saying the same words

1440 And when he returned he found them again asleep for their eyes
were heavy and they knew not what to answer him

1441 And he cometh the third time and saith to them Sleep ye now and
take your rest It is enough The hour is come behold the Son of man
shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners

1442 Rise up let us go Behold he that will betray me is at hand

1443 And while he was yet speaking cometh Judas Iscariot one of the
twelve and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the
chief priests and the scribes and the ancients

1444 And he that betrayed him had given them a sign saying
Whomsoever I shall kiss that is he Lay hold on him and lead him away
carefully

1445 And when he was come immediately going up to him he saith
Hail Rabbi And he kissed him

1446 But they laid hands on him and held him

1447 And one of them that stood by drawing a sword struck a servant
of the chief priest and cut off his ear

1448 And Jesus answering said to them Are you come out as to a
robber with swords and staves to apprehend me

1449 I was daily with you in the temple teaching and you did not lay
hands on me But that the scriptures may be fulfilled

1450 Then his disciples leaving him all fled away

1451 And a certain young man followed him having a linen cloth cast
about his naked body And they laid hold on him

1452 But he casting off the linen cloth fled from them naked

1453 And they brought Jesus to the high priest And all the priests
and the scribes and the ancients assembled together

1454 And Peter followed him afar off even into the court of the high
priest And he sat with the servants at the fire and warmed himself

1455 And the chief priests and all the council sought for evidence
against Jesus that they might put him to death and found none

1456 For many bore false witness against him and their evidences
were not agreeing

1457 And some rising up bore false witness against him saying

1458 We heard him say I Will destroy this temple made with hands and
within three days I will build another not made with hands

1459 And their witness did not agree

1460 And the high priest rising up in the midst asked Jesus saying
Answerest thou nothing to the things that are laid to thy charge by
these men

1461 But he held his peace and answered nothing Again the high
priest asked him and said to him Art thou the Christ the Son of the
Blessed God

1462 And Jesus said to him I am And you shall see the Son of man
sitting on the right hand of the power of God and coming with the
clouds of heaven

1463 Then the high priest rending his garments saith What need we
any further witnesses

1464 You have heard the blasphemy What think you Who all condemned
him to be guilty of death

1465 And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to
buffet him and to say unto him Prophesy And the servants struck him
with the palms their hands

1466 Now when Peter was in the court below there cometh one of the
maidservants of the high priest

1467 And when she had seen Peter warming himself looking on him she
saith Thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth

1468 But he denied saying I neither know nor understand what thou
sayest And he went forth before the court and the cock crew

1469 And again a maidservant seeing him began to say to the standers
by This is one of them

1470 But he denied again And after a while they that stood by said
again to Peter Surely thou art one of them for thou art also a
Galilean

1471 But he began o curse and to swear saying I know not this man
of whom you speak

1472 And immediately the cock crew again And Peter remembered the
word that Jesus had said unto him Before the cock crow twice thou
shalt thrice deny me And he began to weep



Mark Chapter 15


The continuation of the history of the passion

151 And straightway in the morning the chief priests holding a
consultation with the ancients and the scribes and the whole council
binding Jesus led him away and delivered him to Pilate

152 And Pilate asked him Art thou the king of the Jews But he
answering saith to him Thou sayest it

153 And the chief priests accused him in many things

154 And Pilate again asked him saying Answerest thou nothing
Behold in how many things they accuse thee

155 But Jesus still answered nothing so that Pilate wondered

156 Now on the festival day he was wont to release unto them one of
the prisoners whomsoever they demanded

157 And there was one called Barabbas who was put in prison with
some seditious men who in the sedition had committed murder

158 And when the multitude was come up they began to desire that he
would do as he had ever done unto them

159 And Pilate answered them and said Will you that I release to you
the king of the Jews

1510 For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up out of
envy

1511 But the chief priests moved the people that he should rather
release Barabbas to them

1512 And Pilate again answering saith to them What will you then
that I do to the king of the Jews

1513 But they again cried out Crucify him

1514 And Pilate saith to them Why what evil hath he done But they
cried out the more Crucify him

1515 And so Pilate being willing to satisfy the people released to
them Barabbas and delivered up Jesus when he had scourged him to be
crucified

1516 And the soldiers led him away into the court of the palace and
they called together the whole band

1517 And they clothed him with purple and platting a crown of
thorns they put it upon him

1518 And they began to salute him Hail king of the Jews

1519 And they struck his head with a reed and they did spit on him
And bowing their knees they adored him

1520 And after they had mocked him they took off the purple from him
and put his own garments on him and they led him out to crucify him

1521 And they forced one Simon a Cyrenian who passed by coming out
of the country the father of Alexander and of Rufus to take up his
cross

1522 And they bring him into the place called Golgotha which being
interpreted is The place of Calvary

1523 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh But he took
it not

1524 And crucifying him they divided his garments casting lots upon
them what every man should take

1525 And it was the third hour and they crucified him

The third hour  The ancient account divided the day into four parts
which were named from the hour from which they began the first third
sixth and ninth hour Our Lord was crucified a little before noon
before the third hour had quite expired but when the sixth hour was
near at hand

1526 And the inscription of his cause was written over THE KING OF
THE JEWS

1527 And with him they crucify two thieves the one on his right
hand and the other on his left

1528 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith And with the
wicked he was reputed

1529 And they that passed by blasphemed him wagging their heads and
saying Vah thou that destroyest the temple of God and in three days
buildest it up again

1530 Save thyself coming down from the cross

1531 In like manner also the chief priests mocking said with the
scribes one to another He saved others himself he cannot save

1532 Let Christ the king of Israel come down now from the cross that
we may see and believe And they that were crucified with him reviled
him

1533 And when the sixth hour was come there was darkness over the
whole earth until the ninth hour

1534 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice
saying Eloi Eloi lamma sabacthani Which is being interpreted My
God My God Why hast thou forsaken me

1535 And some of the standers by hearing said Behold he calleth
Elias

1536 And one running and filling a sponge with vinegar and putting it
upon a reed gave him to drink saying Stay let us see if Elias come
to take him down

1537 And Jesus having cried out with a loud voice gave up the
ghost

1538 And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the
bottom

1539 And the centurion who stood over against him seeing that crying
out in this manner he had given up the ghost said Indeed this man was
the son of God

1540 And there were also women looking on afar off among whom was
Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joseph and
Salome

1541 Who also when he was in Galilee followed him and ministered to
him and many other women that came up with him to Jerusalem

1542 And when evening was now come because it was the Parasceve
that is the day before the sabbath

1543 Joseph of Arimathea a noble counsellor who was also himself
looking for the kingdom of God came and went in boldly to Pilate and
begged the body of Jesus

1544 But Pilate wondered that he should be already dead And sending
for the centurion he asked him if he were already dead

1545 And when he had understood it by the centurion he gave the body
to Joseph

1546 And Joseph buying fine linen and taking him down wrapped him
up in the fine linen and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewed out of
a rock And he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre

1547 And Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of Joseph beheld where he
was laid



Mark Chapter 16


Christs resurrection and ascension

161 And when the sabbath was past Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother
of James and Salome bought sweet spices that coming they might anoint
Jesus

162 And very early in the morning the first day of the week they
come to the sepulchre the sun being now risen

The sun being now risen  They set out before it was light to go to
the sepulchre but the sun was risen when they arrived there Or
figuratively the sun here spoken of is the sun of justice Christ
Jesus our Lord who was risen before their coming

163 And they said one to another Who shall roll us back the stone
from the door of the sepulchre

164 And looking they saw the stone rolled back For it was very
great

165 And entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sitting on
the right side clothed with a white robe and they were astonished

166 Who saith to them Be not affrighted you seek Jesus of Nazareth
who was crucified He is risen he is not here Behold the place where
they laid him

167 But go tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you
into Galilee There you shall see him as he told you

168 But they going out fled from the sepulchre for a trembling and
fear had seized them And they said nothing to any man for they were
afraid

169 But he rising early the first day of the week appeared first to
Mary Magdalen out of whom he had cast seven devils

1610 She went and told them that had been with him who were mourning
and weeping

1611 And they hearing that he was alive and had been seen by her did
not believe

1612 And after that he appeared in another shape to two of them
walking as they were going into the country

1613 And they going told it to the rest neither did they believe
them

1614 At length he appeared to the eleven as they were at table and
he upbraided them with their incredulity and hardness of heart because
they did not believe them who had seen him after he was risen again

1615 And he said to them Go ye into the whole world and preach the
gospel to every creature

1616 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that
believeth not shall he condemned

1617 And these signs shall follow them that believe In my name they
shall cast out devils They shall speak with new tongues

1618 They shall take up serpents and if they shall drink any deadly
thing it shall not hurt them They shall lay their hand upon the sick
and they shall recover

1619 And the Lord Jesus after he had spoken to them was taken up
into heaven and sitteth on the right hand of God

1620 But they going forth preached every where the Lord working
withal and confirming the word with signs that followed




THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST LUKE



St Luke was a native of Antioch the capital of Syria He was by
profession a physician and some ancient writers say that he was very
skillful in painting He was converted by St Paul and became his
disciple and companion in his travels and fellowlabourer in the
ministry of the Gospel He wrote in Greek about twentyfour years
after our Lords Ascension



Luke Chapter 1


The conception of John the Baptist and of Christ The visitation and
canticle of the Blessed Virgin The birth of the Baptist and the
canticle of Zachary

11 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a
narration of the things that have been accomplished among us

12 According as they have delivered them unto us who from the
beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word

13 It seemed good to me also having diligently attained to all
things from the beginning to write to thee in order most excellent
Theophilus

14 That thou mayest know the verity of those words in which thou hast
been instructed

15 There was in the days of Herod the king of Judea a certain
priest named Zachary of the course of Abia and his wife was of the
daughters of Aaron and her name Elizabeth

Of the course of Abia  that is of the rank of Abia which word in
the Greek is commonly put for the employment of one day but here for
the functions of a whole week For by the appointment of David 1 Par
24 the descendants from Aaron were divided into twentyfour families
of which the eighth was Abia from whom descended this Zachary who at
this time was in the week of his priestly functions

16 And they were both just before God walking in all the
commandments and justifications of the Lord without blame

17 And they had no son for that Elizabeth was barren and they both
were well advanced in years

18 And it came to pass when he executed the priestly function in the
order of his course before God

19 According to the custom of the priestly office it was his lot to
offer incense going into the temple of the Lord

110 And all the multitude of the people was praying without at the
hour of incense

111 And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the
right side of the altar of incense

112 And Zachary seeing him was troubled and fear fell upon him

113 But the angel said to him Fear not Zachary for thy prayer is
heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son And thou shalt
call his name John

114 And thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice in
his nativity

115 For he shall be great before the Lord and shall drink no wine nor
strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his
mothers womb

116 And he shall convert many of the children of Israel to the Lord
their God

117 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias that
he may turn the hearts of the fathers unto the children and the
incredulous to the wisdom of the just to prepare unto the Lord a
perfect people

118 And Zachary said to the angel Whereby shall I know this For I
am an old man and my wife is advanced in years

119 And the angel answering said to him I am Gabriel who stand
before God and am sent to speak to thee and to bring thee these good
tidings

120 And behold thou shalt be dumb and shalt not be able to speak
until the day wherein these things shall come to pass because thou
hast not believed my words which shall be fulfilled in their time

121 And the people were waiting for Zachary and they wondered that
he tarried so long in the temple

122 And when he came out he could not speak to them and they
understood that he had seen a vision in the temple And he made signs
to them and remained dumb

123 And it came to pass after the days of his office were
accomplished he departed to his own house

124 And after those days Elizabeth his wife conceived and hid
herself five months saying

125 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he hath had
regard to take away my reproach among men

126 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God into
a city of Galilee called Nazareth

127 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the house
of David and the virgins name was Mary

128 And the angel being come in said unto her Hail full of grace
the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women

129 Who having heard was troubled at his saying and thought with
herself what manner of salutation this should be

130 And the angel said to her Fear not Mary for thou hast found
grace with God

131 Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and shalt bring forth a
son and thou shalt call his name Jesus

132 He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Most High
And the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his father
and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever

133 And of his kingdom there shall be no end

134 And Mary said to the angel How shall this be done because I
know not man

135 And the angel answering said to her The Holy Ghost shall come
upon thee and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee And
therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the
Son of God

136 And behold thy cousin Elizabeth she also hath conceived a son in
her old age and this is the sixth month with her that is called
barren

137 Because no word shall be impossible with God

138 And Mary said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it done to me
according to thy word And the angel departed from her

139 And Mary rising up in those days went into the hill country with
haste into a city of Juda

140 And she entered into the house of Zachary and saluted Elizabeth

141 And it came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of
Mary the infant leaped in her womb And Elizabeth was filled with the
Holy Ghost

142 And she cried out with a loud voice and said Blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb

143 And whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come
to me

144 For behold as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my
ears the infant in my womb leaped for joy

145 And blessed art thou that hast believed because those things
shall be accomplished that were spoken to thee by the Lord

146 And Mary said My soul doth magnify the Lord

147 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour

148 Because he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid for behold
from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed

Shall call me blessed  These words are a prediction of that honour
which the church in all ages should pay to the Blessed Virgin Let
Protestants examine whether they are any way concerned in this
prophecy

149 Because he that is mighty hath done great things to me and holy
is his name

150 And his mercy is from generation unto generations to them that
fear him

151 He hath shewed might in his arm he hath scattered the proud in
the conceit of their heart

152 He hath put down the mighty from their seat and hath exalted the
humble

153 He hath filled the hungry with good things and the rich he hath
sent empty away

154 He hath received Israel his servant being mindful of his mercy

155 As he spoke to our fathers to Abraham and to his seed for ever

156 And Mary abode with her about three months And she returned to
her own house

157 Now Elizabeths full time of being delivered was come and she
brought forth a son

158 And her neighbors and kinsfolks heard that the Lord had shewed
his great mercy towards her and they congratulated with her

159 And it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to
circumcise the child and they called him by his fathers name Zachary

160 And his mother answering said Not so But he shall be called
John

161 And they said to her There is none of thy kindred that is called
by this name

162 And they made signs to his father how he would have him called

163 And demanding a writing table he wrote saying John is his
name And they all wondered

164 And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed and
he spoke blessing God

165 And fear came upon all their neighbours and all these things
were noised abroad over all the hill country of Judea

166 And all they that had heard them laid them up in their heart
saying What an one think ye shall this child be For the hand of the
Lord was with him

167 And Zachary his father was filled with the Holy Ghost And he
prophesied saying

168 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel because he hath visited and
wrought the redemption of his people

169 And hath raised up an horn of salvation to us in the house of
David his servant

Horn of salvation  That is A powerful salvation as Dr Witham
translates it For in the Scripture by horn is generally understood
strength and power

170 As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who are from the
beginning

171 Salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us

172 To perform mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy
testament

173 The oath which he swore to Abraham our father that he would
grant to us

174 That being delivered from the hand of our enemies we may serve
him without fear

175 In holiness and justice before him all our days

176 And thou child shalt be called the prophet of the Highest for
thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways

177 To give knowledge of salvation to his people unto the remission
of their sins

178 Through the bowels of the mercy of our God in which the Orient
from on high hath visited us

The Orient  It is one of the titles of the Messias the true light of
the world and the sun of justice

179 To enlighten them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of
death to direct our feet into the way of peace

180 And the child grew and was strengthened in spirit and was in the
deserts until the day of his manifestation to Israel



Luke Chapter 2


The birth of Christ His presentation in the temple Simeons prophecy
Christ at twelve years of age is found amongst the doctors

21 And it came to pass that in those days there went out a decree
from Caesar Augustus that the whole world should be enrolled

22 This enrolling was first made by Cyrinus the governor of Syria

23 And all went to be enrolled every one into his own city

24 And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth
into Judea to the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he
was of the house and family of David

25 To be enrolled with Mary his espoused wife who was with child

26 And it came to pass that when they were there her days were
accomplished that she should be delivered

27 And she brought forth her first born son and wrapped him up in
swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room
for them in the inn

Her firstborn  The meaning is not that she had afterward any other
child but it is a way of speech among the Hebrews to call them also
the firstborn who are the only children See annotation Matt 1 25

28 And there were in the same country shepherds watching and keeping
the night watches over their flock

29 And behold an angel of the Lord stood by them and the brightness
of God shone round about them and they feared with a great fear

210 And the angel said to them Fear not for behold I bring you
good tidings of great joy that shall be to all the people

211 For this day is born to you a Saviour who is Christ the Lord
in the city of David

212 And this shall be a sign unto you You shall find the infant
wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a manger

213 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly
army praising God and saying

214 Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to men of good
will

215 And it came to pass after the angels departed from them into
heaven the shepherds said one to another Let us go over to Bethlehem
and let us see this word that is come to pass which the Lord hath
shewed to us

216 And they came with haste and they found Mary and Joseph and the
infant lying in the manger

217 And seeing they understood of the word that had been spoken to
them concerning this child

218 And all that heard wondered and at those things that were told
them by the shepherds

219 But Mary kept all these words pondering them in her heart

220 And the shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all
the things they had heard and seen as it was told unto them

221 And after eight days were accomplished that the child should be
circumcised his name was called JESUS which was called by the angel
before he was conceived in the womb

222 And after the days of her purification according to the law of
Moses were accomplished they carried him to Jerusalem to present him
to the Lord

223 As it is written in the law of the Lord Every male opening the
womb shall be called holy to the Lord

224 And to offer a sacrifice according as it is written in the law
of the Lord a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons

225 And behold there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon and this
man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel And the
Holy Ghost was in him

226 And he had received an answer from the Holy Ghost that he should
not see death before he had seen the Christ of the Lord

227 And he came by the Spirit into the temple And when his parents
brought in the child Jesus to do for him according to the custom of
the law

228 He also took him into his arms and blessed God and said

229 Now thou dost dismiss thy servant O Lord according to thy word
in peace

230 Because my eyes have seen thy salvation

231 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples

232 A light to the revelation of the Gentiles and the glory of thy
people Israel

233 And his father and mother were wondering at those things which
were spoken concerning him

234 And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother Behold this
child is set for the fall and for the resurrection of many in Israel
and for a sign which shall be contradicted

For the fall etc  Christ came for the salvation of all men but here
Simeon prophesies what would come to pass that many through their own
wilful blindness and obstinacy would not believe in Christ nor receive
his doctrine which therefore would be ruin to them but to others a
resurrection by their believing in him and obeying his commandments

235 And thy own soul a sword shall pierce that out of many hearts
thoughts may be revealed

236 And there was one Anna a prophetess the daughter of Phanuel of
the tribe of Aser She was far advanced in years and had lived with her
husband seven years from her virginity

237 And she was a widow until fourscore and four years who departed
not from the temple by fastings and prayers serving night and day

238 Now she at the same hour coming in confessed to the Lord and
spoke of him to all that looked for the redemption of Israel

239 And after they had performed all things according to the law of
the Lord they returned into Galilee to their city Nazareth

240 And the child grew and waxed strong full of wisdom and the
grace of God was in him

241 And his parents went every year to Jerusalem at the solemn day
of the pasch

242 And when he was twelve years old they going up into Jerusalem
according to the custom of the feast

243 And having fulfilled the days when they returned the child
Jesus remained in Jerusalem And his parents knew it not

244 And thinking that he was in the company they came a days
journey and sought him among their kinsfolks and acquaintance

245 And not finding him they returned into Jerusalem seeking him

246 And it came to pass that after three days they found him in
the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors hearing them and
asking them questions

247 And all that heard him were astonished at his wisdom and his
answers

248 And seeing him they wondered And his mother said to him Son
why hast thou done so to us Behold thy father and I have sought thee
sorrowing

249 And he said to them How is it that you sought me Did you not
know that I must be about my fathers business

250 And they understood not the word that he spoke unto them

251 And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject
to them And his mother kept all these words in her heart

252 And Jesus advanced in wisdom and age and grace with God and men



Luke Chapter 3


Johns mission and preaching Christ is baptized by him

31 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar Pontius
Pilate being governor of Judea and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee
and Philip his brother tetrarch of Iturea and the country of
Trachonitis and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilina

32 Under the high priests Anna and Caiphas the word of the Lord was
made unto John the son of Zachary in the desert

33 And he came into all the country about the Jordan preaching the
baptism of penance for the remission of sins

34 As it was written in the book of the sayings of Isaias the
prophet A voice of one crying in the wilderness Prepare ye the way of
the Lord make straight his paths

35 Every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be
brought low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways
plain

36 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God

37 He said therefore to the multitudes that went forth to be baptized
by him Ye offspring of vipers who hath shewed you to flee from the
wrath to come

38 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of penance and do not begin
to say We have Abraham for our father For I say unto you that God is
able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham

39 For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees Every tree
therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be cut down and cast
into the fire

310 And the people asked him saying What then shall we do

311 And he answering said to them He that hath two coats let him
give to him that hath none and he that hath meat let him do in like
manner

312 And the publicans also came to be baptized and said to him
Master what shall we do

313 But he said to them Do nothing more than that which is appointed
you

314 And the soldiers also asked him saying And what shall we do
And he said to them Do violence to no man neither calumniate any man
and be content with your pay

315 And as the people were of opinion and all were thinking in their
hearts of John that perhaps he might be the Christ

316 John answered saying unto all I indeed baptize you with water
but there shall come one mightier than I the latchet of whose shoes I
am not worthy to loose He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and
with fire

317 Whose fan is in his hand and he will purge his floor and will
gather the wheat into his barn but the chaff he will burn with
unquenchable fire

318 And many other things exhorting did he preach to the people

319 But Herod the tetrarch when he was reproved by him for Herodias
his brothers wife and for all the evils which Herod had done

320 He added this also above all and shut up John in prison

321 Now it came to pass when all the people were baptized that
Jesus also being baptized and praying heaven was opened

322 And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape as a dove upon
him And a voice came from heaven Thou art my beloved Son In thee I
am well pleased

323 And Jesus himself was beginning about the age of thirty years
being as it was supposed the son of Joseph who was of Heli who was
of Mathat

Who was of Heli  St Joseph who by nature was the son of Jacob St
Matt 1 16 in the account of the law was son of Heli For Heli and
Jacob were brothers by the same mother and Heli who was the elder
dying without issue Jacob as the law directed married his widow in
consequence of such marriage his son Joseph was reputed in the law the
son of Heli

324 Who was of Levi who was of Melchi who was of Janne who was of
Joseph

325 Who was of Mathathias who was of Amos who was of Nahum who was
of Hesli who was of Nagge

326 Who was of Mahath who was of Mathathias who was of Semei who
was of Joseph who was of Juda

327 Who was of Joanna who was of Reza who was of Zorobabel who was
of Salathiel who was of Neri

328 Who was of Melchi who was of Addi who was of Cosan who was of
Helmadan who was of Her

329 Who was of Jesus who was of Eliezer who was of Jorim who was
of Mathat who was of Levi

330 Who was of Simeon who was of Judas who was of Joseph who was
of Jona who was of Eliakim

331 Who was of Melea who was of Menna who was of Mathatha who was
of Nathan who was of David

Salmon who was of Naasson

Luke Chapter 4


Christs fasting and temptation He is persecuted in Nazareth His
miracles in Capharnaum

41 And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from the Jordan
and was led the by the spirit into the desert

42 For the space of forty days and was tempted by the devil And he
ate nothing in those days And when they were ended he was hungry

43 And the devil said to him If thou be the Son of God say to this
stone that it be made bread

44 And Jesus answered him is written that Man liveth not by bread
alone but by every word of God

45 And the devil led him into a high mountain and shewed him all the
kingdoms of the world in a moment of time

46 And he said to him To thee will I give all this power and the
glory of them For to me they are delivered and to whom I will I give
them

47 If thou therefore wilt adore before me all shall be thine

48 And Jesus answering said to him It is written Thou shalt adore
the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve

49 And he brought him to Jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the
temple and said to him If thou be the Son of God cast thyself from
hence

410 For it is written that He hath given his angels charge over thee
that they keep thee

411 And that in their hands they shall bear thee up lest perhaps
thou dash thy foot against a stone

412 And Jesus answering said to him It is said Thou shalt not
tempt the Lord thy God

413 And all the temptation being ended the devil departed from him
for a time

414 And Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee and
the fame of him went out through the whole country

415 And he taught in their synagogues and was magnified by all

416 And he came to Nazareth where he was brought up and he went
into the synagogue according to his custom on the sabbath day and he
rose up to read

417 And the book of Isaias the prophet was delivered unto him And as
he unfolded the book he found the place where it was written

418 The spirit of the Lord is upon me Wherefore he hath anointed me
to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the contrite
of heart

419 To preach deliverance to the captives and sight to the blind to
set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of
the Lord and the day of reward

420 And when he had folded the book he restored it to the minister
and sat down And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him

421 And he began to say to them This day is fulfilled this scripture
in your ears

422 And all gave testimony to him And they wondered at the words of
grace that proceeded from his mouth And they said Is not this the son
of Joseph

423 And he said to them Doubtless you will say to me this
similitude Physician heal thyself As great things as we have heard
done in Capharnaum do also here in thy own country

424 And he said Amen I say to you that no prophet is accepted in his
own country

425 In truth I say to You there were many widows in the days of
Elias in Israel when heaven was shut up three years and six months
when there was a great famine throughout all the earth

426 And to none of them was Elias sent but to Sarepta of Sidon to a
widow woman

427 And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Eliseus the
prophet and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian

428 And all they in the synagogue hearing these things were filled
with anger

429 And they rose up and thrust him out of the city and they brought
him to the brow of the hill whereon their city was built that they
might cast him down headlong

430 But he passing through the midst of them went his way

431 And he went down into Capharnaum a city of Galilee and there he
taught them on the sabbath days

432 And they were astonished at his doctrine for his speech was with
power

433 And in the synagogue there was a man who had an unclean devil
and he cried out with a loud voice

434 Saying Let us alone What have we to do with thee Jesus of
Nazareth Art thou come to destroy us I know thee who thou art the
holy one of God

435 And Jesus rebuked him saying Hold thy peace and go out of him
And when the devil had thrown him into the midst he went out of him
and hurt him not at all

436 And there came fear upon all and they talked among themselves
saying What word is this for with authority and power he commandeth
the unclean spirits and they go out

437 And the fame of him was published into every place of the
country

438 And Jesus rising up out of the synagogue went into Simons
house And Simons wifes mother was taken with a great fever and they
besought him for her

439 And standing over her he commanded the fever and it left her
And immediately rising she ministered to them

440 And when the sun was down all they that had any sick with divers
diseases brought them to him But he laying his hands on every one of
them healed them

441 And devils went out from many crying out and saying Thou art
the son of God And rebuking them he suffered them not to speak for
they knew that he was Christ

442 And when it was day going out he went into a desert place and
the multitudes sought him and came unto him And they stayed him that
should not depart from them

443 To whom he said To other cities also I must preach the kingdom
of God for therefore am I sent

444 And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee



Luke Chapter 5


The miraculous draught of fishes The cure of the leper and of the
paralytic The call of Matthew

51 And it came to pass that when the multitudes pressed upon him to
hear the word of God he stood by the lake of Genesareth

52 And saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were
gone out of them and were washing their nets

53 And going into one of the ships that was Simons he desired him
to draw back a little from the land And sitting he taught the
multitudes out of the ship

54 Now when he had ceased to speak he said to Simon Launch out into
the deep and let down your nets for a draught

55 And Simon answering said to him Master we have laboured all the
night and have taken nothing but at thy word I will let down the net

56 And when they had done this they enclosed a very great multitude
of fishes and their net broke

57 And they beckoned to their partners that were in the other ship
that they should come and help them And they came and filled both the
ships so that they were almost sinking

58 Which when Simon Peter saw he fell down at Jesus knees saying
Depart from me for I am a sinful man O Lord

59 For he was wholly astonished and all that were with him at the
draught of the fishes which they had taken

510 And so were also James and John the sons of Zebedee who were
Simons partners And Jesus saith to Simon Fear not from henceforth
thou shalt catch men

511 And having brought their ships to land leaving all things they
followed him

512 And it came to pass when he was in a certain city behold a man
full of leprosy who seeing Jesus and falling on his face besought him
saying Lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean

513 And stretching forth his hand he touched him saying I will Be
thou cleansed And immediately the leprosy departed from him

514 And he charged him that he should tell no man but Go shew
thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing according as Moses
commanded for a testimony to them

515 But the fame of him went abroad the more and great multitudes
came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities

516 And he retired into the desert and prayed

517 And it came to pass on a certain day as he sat teaching that
there were also Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by that were
come out of every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem and the
power of the Lord was to heal them

518 And behold men brought in a bed a man who had the palsy and
they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before him

519 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in
because of the multitude they went up upon the roof and let him down
through the tiles with his bed into the midst before Jesus

520 Whose faith when he saw he said Man thy sins are forgiven
thee

521 And the scribes and Pharisees began to think saying Who is this
who speaketh blasphemies Who can forgive sins but God alone

522 And when Jesus knew their thoughts answering he said to them
What is it you think in your hearts

523 Which is easier to say Thy sins are forgiven thee or to say
Arise and walk

524 But that you may know that the Son of man hath the power on earth
to forgive sins he saith to the sick of the palsy I say to thee to
Arise take up thy bed and go into thy house

525 And immediately rising up before them he took up the bed on
which he lay and he went away to his own house glorifying God

526 And all were astonished and they glorified God And they were
filled with fear saying We have seen wonderful things today

527 And after these things he went forth and saw a publican named
Levi sitting at the receipt of custom and he said to him Follow me

528 And leaving all things he rose up and followed him

529 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house And there was a
great company of publicans and of others that were at table with them

530 But the Pharisees and scribes murmured saying to his disciples
Why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners

531 And Jesus answering said to them They that are whole need not
the physician but they that are sick

532 I came not to call the just but sinners to penance

533 And they said to him Why do the disciples of John fast often and
make prayers and the disciples of the Pharisees in like manner but
thine eat and drink

534 To whom he said Can you make the children of the bridegroom fast
whilst the bridegroom is with them

535 But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away
from them then shall they fast in those days

536 And he spoke also a similitude to them That no man putteth a
piece from a new garment upon an old garment otherwise he both rendeth
the new and the piece taken from the new agreeth not with the old

537 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles otherwise the new
wine will break the bottles and it will be spilled and the bottles
will be lost

538 But new wine must be put into new bottles and both are
preserved

539 And no man drinking old hath presently a mind to new for he
saith The old is better



Luke Chapter 6


Christ excuses his disciples He cures upon the sabbath day chooses
the twelve and makes a sermon to them

61 And it came to pass on the second first sabbath that as he went
through the corn fields his disciples plucked the ears and did eat
rubbing them in their hands

The second first sabbath  Some understand this of the sabbath of
Pentecost which was the second in course among the great feasts
others of a sabbath day that immediately followed any solemn feast

62 And some of the Pharisees said to them Why do you that which is
not lawful on the sabbath days

63 And Jesus answering them said Have you not read so much as this
what David did when himself was hungry and they that were with him

64 How he went into the house of God and took and ate the bread of
proposition and gave to them that were with him which is not lawful to
eat but only for the priests

65 And he said to them The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath

66 And it came to pass also on another sabbath that he entered into
the synagogue and taught And there was a man whose right hand was
withered

67 And the scribes and Pharisees watched if he would heal on the
sabbath that they might find an accusation against him

68 But he knew their thoughts and said to the man who had the
withered hand Arise and stand forth in the midst And rising he stood
forth

69 Then Jesus said to them I ask you if it be lawful on the sabbath
days to do good or to do evil To save life or to destroy

610 And looking round about on them all he said to the man Stretch
forth thy hand And he stretched it forth And his hand was restored

611 And they were filled with madness and they talked one with
another what they might do to Jesus

612 And it came to pass in those days that he went out into a
mountain to pray and he passed the whole night in the prayer of God

613 And when day was come he called unto him his disciples and he
chose twelve of them whom also he named apostles

614 Simon whom he surnamed Peter and Andrew his brother James and
John Philip and Bartholomew

615 Matthew and Thomas James the son of Alpheus and Simon who is
called Zelotes

616 And Jude the brother of James and Judas Iscariot who was the
traitor

617 And coming down with them he stood in a plain place and the
company of his disciples and a very great multitude of people from all
Judea and Jerusalem and the sea coast both of Tyre and Sidon

618 Who were come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases And
they that were troubled with unclean spirits were cured

619 And all the multitude sought to touch him for virtue went out
from him and healed all

620 And he lifting up his eyes on his disciples said Blessed are
ye poor for yours is the kingdom of God

621 Blessed are ye that hunger now for you shall be filled Blessed
are ye that weep now for you shall laugh

622 Blessed shall you be when men shall hate you and when they shall
separate you and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil for
the Son of mans sake

623 Be glad in that day and rejoice for behold your reward is great
in heaven For according to these things did their fathers to the
prophets

624 But woe to you that are rich for you have your consolation

625 Woe to you that are filled for you shall hunger Woe to you that
now laugh for you shall mourn and weep

626 Woe to you when men shall bless you for according to these
things did their fathers to the false prophets

627 But I say to you that hear Love your enemies Do good to them
that hate you

628 Bless them that curse you and pray for them that calumniate you

629 And to him that striketh thee on the one cheek offer also the
other And him that taketh away from thee thy cloak forbid not to take
thy coat also

630 Give to every one that asketh thee and of him that taketh away
thy goods ask them not again

631 And as you would that men should do to you do you also to them
in like manner

632 And if you love them that love you what thanks are to you For
sinners also love those that love them

633 And if you do good to them who do good to you what thanks are to
you For sinners also do this

634 And if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive what thanks
are to you For sinners also lend to sinners for to receive as much

635 But love ye your enemies do good and lend hoping for nothing
thereby and your reward shall be great and you shall be the sons of
the Highest For he is kind to the unthankful and to the evil

636 Be ye therefore merciful as your Father also is merciful

637 Judge not and you shall not be judged Condemn not and you
shall not be condemned Forgive and you shall be forgiven

638 Give and it shall be given to you good measure and pressed down
and shaken together and running over shall they give into your bosom
For with the same measure that you shall mete withal it shall be
measured to you again

639 And he spoke also to them a similitude Can the blind lead the
blind Do they not both fall into the ditch

640 The disciple is not above his master but every one shall be
perfect if he be as his master

641 And why seest thou the mote in thy brothers eye but the beam
that is in thy own eye thou considerest not

642 Or how canst thou say to thy brother Brother let me pull the
mote out of thy eye when thou thyself seest not the beam in thy own
eye Hypocrite cast first the beam out of thy own eye and then shalt
thou see clearly to take out the mote from thy brothers eye

643 For there is no good tree that bringeth forth evil fruit nor an
evil tree that bringeth forth good fruit

644 For every tree is known by its fruit For men do not gather figs
from thorns nor from a bramble bush do they gather the grape

645 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth
that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth
forth that which is evil For out of the abundance of the heart the
mouth speaketh

646 And why call you me Lord Lord and do not the things which I
say

647 Every one that cometh to me and heareth my words and doth them I
will shew you to whom he is like

648 He is like to a man building a house who digged deep and laid
the foundation upon a rock And when a flood came the stream beat
vehemently upon that house and it could not shake it for it was
founded on a rock

649 But he that heareth and doth not is like to a man building his
house upon the earth without a foundation against which the stream
beat vehemently And immediately it fell and the ruin of that house
was great



Luke Chapter 7


Christ heals the centurions servant He raises the widows son to
life answers the messengers sent by John and absolves the penitent
sinner

71 And when he had finished all his words in the hearing of the
people he entered into Capharnaum

72 And the servant of a certain centurion who was dear to him being
sick was ready to die

73 And when he had heard of Jesus he sent unto him the ancients of
the Jews desiring him to come and heal his servant

74 And when they came to Jesus they besought him earnestly saying
to him He is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him

75 For he loveth our nation and he hath built us a synagogue

76 And Jesus went with them And when he was now not far from the
house the centurion sent his friends to him saying Lord trouble not
thyself for I am not worthy that thou shouldst enter under my roof

77 For which cause neither did I think myself worthy to come to thee
but say the word and my servant shall be healed

78 For I also am a man subject to authority having under me
soldiers and I say to one Go and he goeth and to another Come and
he cometh and to my servant Do this and he doth it

79 Which Jesus hearing marvelled and turning about to the multitude
that followed him he said Amen I say to you I have not found so
great faith not even in Israel

710 And they who were sent being returned to the house found the
servant whole who had been sick

711 And it came to pass afterwards that he went into a city that is
called Naim and there went with him his disciples and a great
multitude

712 And when he came nigh to the gate of the city behold a dead man
was carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow And a
great multitude of the city was with her

713 Whom when the Lord had seen being moved with mercy towards her
he said to her Weep not

714 And he came near and touched the bier And they that carried it
stood still And he said Young man I say to thee arise

715 And he that was dead sat up and begun to speak And he gave him
to his mother

716 And there came a fear upon them all and they glorified God
saying A great prophet is risen up among us and God hath visited his
people

717 And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judea and
throughout all the country round about

718 And Johns disciples told him of all these things

719 And John called to him two of his disciples and sent them to
Jesus saying Art thou he that art to come Or look we for another

720 And when the men were come unto him they said John the Baptist
hath sent us to thee saying Art thou he that art to come Or look we
for another

721 And in that same hour he cured many of their diseases and hurts
and evil spirits and to many that were blind he gave sight

722 And answering he said to them Go and relate to John what you
have heard and seen the blind see the lame walk the lepers are made
clean the deaf hear the dead rise again to the poor the gospel is
preached

723 And blessed is he whosoever shall not be scandalized in me

724 And when the messengers of John were departed he began to speak
to the multitudes concerning John What went ye out into the desert to
see A reed shaken with the wind

725 But what went you out to see A man clothed in soft garments
Behold they that are in costly apparel and live delicately are in the
houses of kings

726 But what went you out to see A prophet Yea I say to you and
more than a prophet

727 This is he of whom it is written Behold I send my angel before
thy face who shall prepare thy way before thee

728 For I say to you Amongst those that are born of men there is
not a greater prophet than John the Baptist But he that is the lesser
in the kingdom of God is greater than he

729 And all the people hearing and the publicans justified God
being baptized with Johns baptism

Justified God  that is praised the justice of God feared and
worshipped God as just and merciful

730 But the Pharisees and the lawyers despised the counsel of God
against themselves being not baptized by him

731 And the Lord said Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this
generation And to what are they like

732 They are like to children sitting in the marketplace and speaking
one to another and saying We have piped to you and you have not
danced we have mourned and you have not wept

733 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine
And you say He hath a devil

734 The Son of man is come eating and drinking And you say Behold a
man that is a glutton and a drinker of wine a friend of publicans and
sinners

735 And wisdom is justified by all her children

736 And one of the Pharisees desired him to eat with him And he went
into the house of the Pharisee and sat down to meat

One of the Pharisees that is Simon

737 And behold a woman that was in the city a sinner when she knew
that he sat at meat in the Pharisees house brought an alabaster box
of ointment

738 And standing behind at his feet she began to wash his feet with
tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and
anointed them with the ointment

739 And the Pharisee who had invited him seeing it spoke within
himself saying This man if he were if a prophet would know surely
who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him that she is a
sinner

740 And Jesus answering said to him Simon I have somewhat to say
to thee But he said Master say it

741 A certain creditor had two debtors the one owed five hundred
pence and the other fifty

742 And whereas they had not wherewith to pay he forgave them both
Which therefore of the two loveth him most

743 Simon answering said I suppose that he to whom he forgave most
And he said to him Thou hast judged rightly

744 And turning to the woman he said unto Simon Dost thou see this
woman I entered into thy house thou gavest me no water for my feet
But she with tears hath washed my feet and with her hairs hath wiped
them

745 Thou gavest me no kiss But she since she cane in hath not
ceased to kiss my feet

746 My head with oil thou didst not anoint But she with ointment
hath anointed my feet

747 Wherefore I say to thee Many sins are forgiven her because she
hath loved much But to whom less is forgiven he loveth less

Many sins are forgiven her because she hath loved much  In the
scripture an effect sometimes seems attributed to one only cause when
there are divers other concurring dispositions for the sins of this
woman in this verse are said to be forgiven because she loved much
but ver 50 Christ tells her Thy faith hath made thee safe Hence in
a true conversion are joined faith hope love sorrow for sin and
other pious dispositions

748 And he said to her Thy sins are forgiven thee

749 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within
themselves Who is this that forgiveth sins also

750 And he said to the woman Thy faith hath made thee safe Go in
peace



Luke Chapter 8


The parable of the seed Christ stills the storm at sea casts out the
legion heals the issue of blood and raises the daughter of Jairus to
life

81 And it came to pass afterwards he travelled through the cities and
towns preaching and evangelizing the kingdom of God and the twelve
with him

82 And certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and
infirmities Mary who is called Magdalen out of whom seven devils were
gone forth

83 And Joanna the wife of Chusa Herods steward and Susanna and
many others who ministered unto him of their substance

84 And when a very great multitude was gathered together and hastened
out of the cities unto him he spoke by a similitude

85 The sower went out to sow his seed And as he sowed some fell by
the way side And it was trodden down and the fowls of the air
devoured it

86 And other some fell upon a rock And as soon as it was sprung up
it withered away because it had no moisture

87 And other some fell among thorns And the thorns growing up with
it choked it

88 And other some fell upon good ground and being sprung up yielded
fruit a hundredfold Saying these things he cried out He that hath
ears to hear let him hear

89 And his disciples asked him what this parable might be

810 To whom he said To you it is given to know the mystery of the
kingdom of God but to the rest in parables that seeing they may not
see and hearing may not understand

Seeing they may not see  See the annotation Mark 4 12

811 Now the parable is this The seed is the word of God

812 And they by the way side are they that hear then the devil
cometh and taketh the word out of their heart lest believing they
should be saved

813 Now they upon the rock are they who when they hear receive the
word with joy and these have no roots for they believe for a while
and in time of temptation they fall away

814 And that which fell among thorns are they who have heard and
going their way are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of
this life and yield no fruit

815 But that on the good ground are they who in a good and perfect
heart hearing the word keep it and bring forth fruit in patience

816 Now no man lighting a candle covereth it with a vessel or putteth
it under a bed but setteth it upon a candlestick that they who come
in may see the light

817 For there is not any thing secret that shall not be made
manifest nor hidden that shall not be known and come abroad

818 Take heed therefore how you hear For whosoever hath to him
shall be given and whosoever hath not that also which he thinketh he
hath shall be taken away from him

819 And his mother and brethren came unto him and they could not
come at him for the crowd

820 And it was told him Thy mother and thy brethren stand without
desiring to see thee

821 Who answering said to them My mother and my brethren are they
who hear the word of God and do it

822 And it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a little
ship with his disciples And he said to them Let us go over to the
other side of the lake And they launched forth

823 And when they were sailing he slept And there came down a storm
of wind upon the lake and they were filled and were in danger

824 And they came and awaked him saying Master we perish But he
arising rebuked the wind and the rage of the water And it ceased and
there was a calm

825 And he said to them Where is your faith Who being afraid
wondered saying one to another Who is this think you that he
commandeth both the winds and the sea and they obey him

826 And they sailed to the country of the Gerasens which is over
against Galilee

827 And when he was come forth to the land there met him a certain
man who had a devil now a very long time And he wore no clothes
neither did he abide in a house but in the sepulchres

828 And when he saw Jesus he fell down before him And crying out
with a loud voice he said What have I to do with thee Jesus Son of
the most high God I beseech thee do not torment me

829 For he commanded the unclean spirit to go out of the man For
many times it seized him and he was bound with chains and kept in
fetters and breaking the bonds he was driven by the devil into the
deserts

830 And Jesus asked him saying What is thy name But he said
Legion Because many devils were entered into him

831 And they besought him that he would not command them to go into
the abyss

832 And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain
and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them And
he suffered them

833 The devils therefore went out of the man and entered into the
swine And the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake and
were stifled

834 Which when they that fed them saw done they fled away and told
it in the city and in the villages

835 And they went out to see what was done And they came to Jesus
and found the man out of whom the devils were departed sitting at his
feet clothed and in his right mind And they were afraid

836 And they also that had seen told them how he had been healed from
the legion

837 And all the multitude of the country of the Gerasens besought him
to depart from them for they were taken with great fear And he going
up into the ship returned back again

838 Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him
that he might be with him But Jesus sent him away saying

839 Return to thy house and tell how great things God hath done to
thee And he went through the whole city publishing how great things
Jesus had done to him

840 And it came to pass that when Jesus was returned the multitude
received him for they were all waiting for him

841 And behold there came a man whose name was Jairus and he was a
ruler of the synagogue And he fell down at the feet of Jesus
beseeching him that he would come into his house

842 For he had an only daughter almost twelve years old and she was
dying And it happened as he went that he was thronged by the
multitudes

843 And there was a certain woman having an issue of blood twelve
years who had bestowed all her substance on physicians and could not
be healed by any

844 She came behind him and touched the hem of his garment and
immediately the issue of her blood stopped

845 And Jesus said Who is it that touched me And all denying Peter
and they that were with him said Master the multitudes throng and
press thee and dost thou say who touched me

846 And Jesus said Somebody hath touched me for I know that virtue
is gone out from me

847 And the woman seeing that she was not hid came trembling and
fell down before his feet and declared before all the people for what
cause she had touched him and how she was immediately healed

848 But he said to her Daughter thy faith hath made thee whole Go
thy way in peace

849 As he was yet speaking there cometh one to the ruler of the
synagogue saying to him Thy daughter is dead trouble him not

850 And Jesus hearing this word answered the father of the maid
Fear not Believe only and she shall be safe

851 And when he was come to the house he suffered not any man to go
in with him but Peter and James and John and the father and mother of
the maiden

852 And all wept and mourned for her But he said Weep not The
maid is not dead but sleepeth

853 And they laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead

854 But he taking her by the hand cried out saying Maid arise

855 And her spirit returned and she arose immediately And he bid
them give her to eat

856 And her parents were astonished whom he charged to tell no man
what was done



Luke Chapter 9


Christ sends forth his apostles feeds five thousand with five loaves
is transfigured and casts out a devil

91 Then calling together the twelve apostles he gave them power and
authority over all devils and to cure diseases

92 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the
sick

93 And he said to them Take nothing for your journey neither staff
nor scrip nor bread nor money neither have two coats

94 And whatsoever house you shall enter into abide there and depart
not from thence

95 And whosoever will not receive you when ye go out of that city
shake off even the dust of your feet for a testimony against them

96 And going out they went about through the towns preaching the
gospel and healing every where

97 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all things that were done by
him And he was in a doubt because it was said

98 By some that John was risen from the dead but by other some that
Elias had appeared and by others that one of the old prophets was
risen again

99 And Herod said John I have beheaded But who is this of whom I
hear such things And he sought to see him

910 And the apostles when they were returned told him all they had
done And taking them he went aside into a desert place apart which
belongeth to Bethsaida

911 Which when the people knew they followed him and he received
them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God and healed them who had
need of healing

912 Now the day began to decline And the twelve came and said to
him Send away the multitude that going into the towns and villages
round about they may lodge and get victuals for we are here in a
desert place

913 But he said to them Give you them to eat And they said We
have no more than five loaves and two fishes unless perhaps we should
go and buy food for all this multitude

914 Now there were about five thousand men And he said to his
disciples Make them sit down by fifties in a company

915 And they did so and made them all sit down

916 And taking the five loaves and the two fishes he looked up to
heaven and blessed them and he broke and distributed to his disciples
to set before the multitude

917 And they did all eat and were filled And there were taken up of
fragments that remained to them twelve baskets

918 And it came to pass as he was alone praying his disciples also
were with him and he asked them saying Whom do the people say that I
am

919 But they answered and said John the Baptist but some say Elias
and others say that one of the former prophets is risen again

920 And he said to them But whom do you say that I am Simon Peter
answering said The Christ of God

921 But he strictly charging them commanded they should tell this to
no man

922 Saying The Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by
the ancients and chief priests and scribes and be killed and the third
day rise again

923 And he said to all If any man will come after me let him deny
himself and take up his cross daily and follow me

924 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it for he that shall
lose his life for my sake shall save it

925 For what is a man advantaged if he gain the whole world and lose
himself and cast away himself

926 For he that shall be ashamed of me and of my words of him the
Son of man shall be ashamed when he shall come in his majesty and that
of his Father and of the holy angels

927 But I tell you of a truth There are some standing here that
shall not taste death till they see the kingdom of God

928 And it came to pass about eight days after these words that he
took Peter and James and John and went up into a mountain to pray

929 And whilst he prayed the shape of his countenance was altered
and his raiment became white and glittering

930 And behold two men were talking with him And they were Moses and
Elias

931 Appearing in majesty And they spoke of his decease that he
should accomplish in Jerusalem

932 But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep And
waking they saw his glory and the two men that stood with him

933 And it came to pass that as they were departing from him Peter
saith to Jesus Master it is good for us to be here and let us make
three tabernacles one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elias
not knowing what he said

934 And as he spoke these things there came a cloud and overshadowed
them And they were afraid when they entered into the cloud

935 And a voice came out of the cloud saying This is my beloved
son Hear him

936 And whilst the voice was uttered Jesus was found alone And they
held their peace and told no man in those days any of these things
which they had seen

937 And it came to pass the day following when they came down from
the mountain there met him a great multitude

938 And behold a man among the crowd cried out saying Master I
beseech thee look upon my son because he is my only one

939 And lo a spirit seizeth him and he suddenly crieth out and he
throweth him down and teareth him so that he foameth and bruising
him he hardly departeth from him

940 And I desired thy disciples to cast him out and they could not

941 And Jesus answering said O faithless and perverse generation
how long shall I be with you and suffer you Bring hither thy son

942 And as he was coming to him the devil threw him down and tore
him

943 And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and cured the boy and
restored him to his father

944 And all were astonished at the mighty power of God But while all
wondered at all the things he did he said to his disciples Lay you up
in your hearts these words for it shall come to pass that the Son of
man shall be delivered into the hands of men

945 But they understood not this word and it was hid from them so
that they perceived it not And they were afraid to ask him concerning
this word

946 And there entered a thought into them which of them should be
greater

947 But Jesus seeing the thoughts of their hearts took a child and
set him by him

948 And said to them Whosoever shall receive this child in my name
receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent
me For he that is the lesser among you all he is the greater

949 And John answering said Master we saw a certain man casting
out devils in thy name and we forbade him because he followeth not
with us

950 And Jesus said to him Forbid him not for he that is not against
you is for you

951 And it came to pass when the days of his assumption were
accomplishing that he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem

952 And he sent messengers before his face and going they entered
into a city of the Samaritans to prepare for him

953 And they received him not because his face was of one going to
Jerusalem

954 And when his disciples James and John had seen this they said
Lord wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and
consume them

955 And turning he rebuked them saying you know not of what spirit
you are

956 The Son of man came not to destroy souls but to save And they
went into another town

957 And it came to pass as they walked in the way that a certain
man said to him I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest

958 Jesus said to him The foxes have holes and the birds of the air
nests but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head

959 But he said to another Follow me And he said Lord suffer me
first to go and to bury my father

960 And Jesus said to him Let the dead bury their dead but go thou
and preach the kingdom of God

961 And another said I will follow thee Lord but let me first take
my leave of them that are at my house

962 Jesus said to him No man putting his hand to the plough and
looking back is fit for the kingdom of God



Luke Chapter 10


Christ sends forth and instructs his seventytwo disciples The good
Samaritan

101 And after these things the Lord appointed also other
seventytwo And he sent them two and two before his face into every
city and place whither he himself was to come

102 And he said to them The harvest indeed is great but the
labourers are few Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that he
send labourers into his harvest

103 Go Behold I send you as lambs among wolves

104 Carry neither purse nor scrip nor shoes and salute no man by
the way

105 Into whatever house you enter first say Peace be to this house

106 And if the son of peace be there your peace shall rest upon him
but if not it shall return to you

107 And in the same house remain eating and drinking such things as
they have for the labourer is worthy of his hire Remove not from
house to house

108 And into what city soever you enter and they receive you eat
such things as are set before you

109 And heal the sick that are therein and say to them The kingdom
of God is come nigh unto you

1010 But into whatsoever city you enter and they receive you not
going forth into the streets thereof say

1011 Even the very dust of your city that cleaveth to us we wipe off
against you Yet know this that the kingdom of God is at hand

1012 I say to you it shall be more tolerable at that day for Sodom
than for that city

1013 Woe to thee Corozain Woe to thee Bethsaida For if in Tyre
and Sidon had been wrought the mighty works that have been wrought in
you they would have done penance long ago sitting in sackcloth and
ashes

1014 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the
judgment than for you

1015 And thou Capharnaum which art exalted unto heaven thou shalt
be thrust down to hell

1016 He that heareth you heareth me and he that despiseth you
despiseth me and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me

1017 And the seventytwo returned with joy saying Lord the devils
also are subject to us in thy name

1018 And he said to them I saw Satan like lightning falling from
heaven

1019 Behold I have given you power to tread upon serpents and
scorpions and upon all the power of the enemy and nothing shall hurt
you

1020 But yet rejoice not in this that spirits are subject unto you
but rejoice in this that your names are written in heaven

1021 In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Ghost and said I
confess to thee O Father Lord of heaven and earth because thou hast
hidden these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them to
little ones Yea Father for so it hath seemed good in thy sight

He rejoiced in the Holy Ghost  That is according to his humanity he
rejoiced in the Holy Ghost and gave thanks to his eternal Father

1022 All things are delivered to me by my Father And no one knoweth
who the Son is but the Father and who the Father is but the Son and
to whom the Son will reveal him

1023 And turning to his disciples he said Blessed are the eyes that
see the things which you see

1024 For I say to you that many prophets and kings have desired to
see the things that you see and have not seen them and to hear the
things that you hear and have not heard them

1025 And behold a certain lawyer stood up tempting him and saying
Master what must I do to possess eternal life

1026 But he said to him What is written in the law How readest
thou

1027 He answering said Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy
whole heart and with thy whole soul and with all thy strength and with
all thy mind and thy neighbour as thyself

1028 And he said to him Thou hast answered right This do and thou
shalt live

1029 But he willing to justify himself said to Jesus And who is my
neighbour

1030 And Jesus answering said A certain man went down from
Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among robbers who also stripped him and
having wounded him went away leaving him half dead

1031 And it chanced that a certain priest went down the same way
and seeing him passed by

1032 In like manner also a Levite when he was near the place and saw
him passed by

1033 But a certain Samaritan being on his journey came near him
and seeing him was moved with compassion

1034 And going up to him bound up his wounds pouring in oil and
wine and setting him upon his own beast brought him to an inn and
took care of him

1035 And the next day he took out two pence and gave to the host and
said Take care of him and whatsoever thou shalt spend over and above
I at my return will repay thee

1036 Which of these three in thy opinion was neighbour to him that
fell among the robbers

1037 But he said He that shewed mercy to him And Jesus said to him
Go and do thou in like manner

1038 Now it came to pass as they went that he entered into a
certain town and a certain woman named Martha received him into her
house

1039 And she had a sister called Mary who sitting also at the
Lords feet heard his word

1040 But Martha was busy about much serving Who stood and said
Lord hast thou no care that my sister hath left me alone to serve
Speak to her therefore that she help me

1041 And the Lord answering said to her Martha Martha thou art
careful and art troubled about many things

1042 But one thing is necessary Mary hath chosen the best part
which shall not be taken away from her



Luke Chapter 11


Christ teaches his disciples to pray He casts out a dumb devil
confutes the Pharisees and pronounces woes against them for their
hypocrisy

111 And it came to pass that as he was in a certain place praying
when he ceased one of his disciples said to him Lord teach us to
pray as John also taught his disciples

112 And he said to them When you pray say Father hallowed be thy
name Thy kingdom come

113 Give us this day our daily bread

114 And forgive us our sins for we also forgive every one that is
indebted to us And lead us not into temptation

115 And he said to them Which of you shall have a friend and shall
go to him at midnight and shall say to him Friend lend me three
loaves

116 Because a friend of mine is come off his journey to me and I have
not what to set before him

117 And he from within should answer and say Trouble me not the
door is now shut and my children are with me in bed I cannot rise and
give thee

118 Yet if he shall continue knocking I say to you although he will
not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of his
importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth

119 And I say to you Ask and it shall be given you seek and you
shall find knock and it shall be opened to you

1110 For every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh
findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened

1111 And which of you if he ask his father bread will he give him a
stone Or a fish will he for a fish give him a serpent

1112 Or if he shall ask an egg will he reach him a scorpion

1113 If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your
children how much more will your Father from heaven give the good
Spirit to them that ask him

1114 And he was casting out a devil and the same was dumb And when
he had cast out the devil the dumb spoke and the multitudes were in
admiration at it

1115 But some of them said He casteth out devils by Beelzebub the
prince of devils

1116 And others tempting asked of him a sign from heaven

1117 But he seeing their thoughts said to them Every kingdom
divided against itself shall be brought to desolation and house upon
house shall fall

1118 And if Satan also be divided against himself how shall his
kingdom stand Because you say that through Beelzebub I cast out
devils

1119 Now if I cast out devils by Beelzebub by whom do your children
cast them out Therefore they shall be your judges

1120 But if I by the finger of God cast out devils doubtless the
kingdom of God is come upon you

1121 When a strong man armed keepeth his court those things are in
peace which he possesseth

1122 But if a stronger than he come upon him and overcome him he
will take away all his armour wherein he trusted and will distribute
his spoils

1123 He that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not
with me scattereth

1124 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through
places without water seeking rest and not finding he saith I will
return into my house whence I came out

1125 And when he is come he findeth it swept and garnished

1126 Then he goeth and taketh with him seven other spirits more
wicked than himself and entering in they dwell there And the last
state of that man becomes worse than the first

1127 And it came to pass as he spoke these things a certain woman
from the crowd lifting up her voice said to him Blessed is the womb
that bore thee and the paps that gave thee suck

1128 But he said Yea rather blessed are they who hear the word of
God and keep it

1129 And the multitudes running together he began to say This
generation is a wicked generation It asketh a sign and a sign shall
not be given it but the sign of Jonas the prophet

1130 For as Jonas was a sign to the Ninivites so shall the Son of
man also be to this generation

1131 The queen of the south shall rise in the judgment with the men
of this generation and shall condemn them because she came from the
ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon And behold more than
Solomon here

1132 The men of Ninive shall rise in the judgment with this
generation and shall condemn it Because they did penance at the
preaching of Jonas And behold more than Jonas here

1133 No man lighteth a candle and putteth it in a hidden place nor
under a bushel but upon a candlestick that they that come in may see
the light

1134 The light of thy body is thy eye If thy eye be single thy
whole body will be lightsome but if it be evil thy body also will be
darksome

1135 Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not
darkness

1136 If then thy whole body be lightsome having no part of darkness
the whole shall be lightsome and as a bright lamp shall enlighten
thee

1137 And as he was speaking a certain Pharisee prayed him that he
would dine with him And he going in sat down to eat

1138 And the Pharisee began to say thinking within himself why he
was not washed before dinner

1139 And the Lord said to him Now you Pharisees make clean the
outside of the cup and of the platter but your inside is full of
rapine and iniquity

1140 Ye fools did not he that made that which is without make also
that which is within

1141 But yet that which remaineth give alms and behold all things
are clean unto you

1142 But woe to you Pharisees because you tithe mint and rue and
every herb and pass over judgment and the charity of God Now these
things you ought to have done and not to leave the other undone

1143 Woe to you Pharisees because you love the uppermost seats in
the synagogues and salutations in the marketplace

1144 Woe to you because you are as sepulchres that appear not and
men that walk over are not aware

1145 And one of the lawyers answering saith to him Master in
saying these things thou reproachest us also

1146 But he said Woe to you lawyers also because you load men with
burdens which they cannot bear and you yourselves touch not the packs
with one of your fingers

Woe to you lawyers  He speaks of the doctors of the law of Moses
commonly called the scribes

1147 Woe to you who build the monuments of the prophets and your
fathers killed them

Woe to you who build etc  Not that the building of the monuments of
the prophets was in itself blameworthy but only the intention of these
unhappy men who made use of this outward shew of religion and piety
as a means to carry on their wicked designs against the prince of
prophets

1148 Truly you bear witness that you consent to the doings of your
fathers For they indeed killed them and you build their sepulchres

1149 For this cause also the wisdom of God said I will send to them
prophets and apostles and some of them they will kill and persecute

1150 That the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the
foundation of the world may be required of this generation

1151 From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias who was
slain between the altar and the temple Yea I say to you It shall be
required of this generation

1152 Woe to you lawyers for you have taken away the key of
knowledge You yourselves have not entered in and those that were
entering in you have hindered

1153 And as he was saying these things to them the Pharisees and the
lawyers began violently to urge him and to oppress his mouth about many
things

1154 Lying in wait for him and seeking to catch something from his
mouth that they might accuse him



Luke Chapter 12


Christ warns us against hypocrisy the fear of the world and
covetousness He admonishes all to watch

121 And when great multitudes stood about him so that they trod one
upon another he began to say to his disciples Beware ye of the leaven
of the Pharisees which is hypocrisy

122 For there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed nor
hidden that shall not be known

123 For whatsoever things you have spoken in darkness shall be
published in the light and that which you have spoken in the ear in
the chambers shall be preached on the housetops

124 And I say to you my friends Be not afraid of them who kill the
body and after that have no more that they can do

125 But I will shew you whom you shall fear Fear ye him who after
he hath killed hath power to cast into hell Yea I say to you Fear
him

126 Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings and not one of them
is forgotten before God

127 Yea the very hairs of your head are all numbered Fear not
therefore you are of more value than many sparrows

128 And I say to you Whosoever shall confess me before men him
shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God

129 But he that shall deny me before men shall be denied before the
angels of God

1210 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man it shall
be forgiven him but to him that shall blaspheme against the Holy
Ghost it shall not be forgiven

1211 And when they shall bring you into the synagogues and to
magistrates and powers be not solicitous how or what you shall answer
or what you shall say

1212 For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what you
must say

1213 And one of the multitude said to him Master speak to my
brother that he divide the inheritance with me

1214 But he said to him Man who hath appointed me judge or divider
over you

1215 And he said to them Take heed and beware of all covetousness
for a mans life doth not consist in the abundance of things which he
possesseth

1216 And he spoke a similitude to them saying The land of a certain
rich man brought forth plenty of fruits

1217 And he thought within himself saying What shall I do because
I have no room where to bestow my fruits

1218 And he said This will I do I will pull down my barns and will
build greater and into them will I gather all things that are grown to
me and my goods

1219 And I will say to my soul Soul thou hast much goods laid up
for many years Take thy rest eat drink make good cheer

1220 But God said to him Thou fool this night do they require thy
soul of thee And whose shall those things be which thou hast provided

1221 So is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich
towards God

1222 And he said to his disciples Therefore I say to you Be not
solicitous for your life what you shall eat nor for your body what
you shall put on

1223 The life is more than the meat and the body is more than the
raiment

1224 Consider the ravens for they sow not neither do they reap
neither have they storehouse nor barn and God feedeth them How much
are you more valuable than they

1225 And which of you by taking thought can add to his stature one
cubit

1226 If then ye be not able to do so much as the least thing why are
you solicitous for the rest

1227 Consider the lilies how they grow they labour not neither do
they spin But I say to you not even Solomon in all his glory was
clothed like one of these

1228 Now if God clothe in this manner the grass that is today in
the field and tomorrow is cast into the oven how much more you O ye
of little faith

1229 And seek not what you shall eat or what you shall drink and be
not lifted up on high

1230 For all these things do the nations of the world seek But your
Father knoweth that you have need of these things

1231 But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his justice and all
these things shall be added unto you

1232 Fear not little flock for it hath pleased your Father to give
you a kingdom

1233 Sell what you possess and give alms Make to yourselves bags
which grow not old a treasure in heaven which faileth not where no
thief approacheth nor moth corrupteth

1234 For where your treasure is there will your heart be also

1235 Let your loins be girt and lamps burning in your hands

1236 And you yourselves like to men who wait for their lord when he
shall return from the wedding that when he cometh and knocketh they
may open to him immediately

1237 Blessed are those servants whom the Lord when he cometh shall
find watching Amen I say to you that he will gird himself and make
them sit down to meat and passing will minister unto them

1238 And if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third
watch and find them so blessed are those servants

1239 But this know ye that if the householder did know at what hour
the thief would come he would surely watch and would not suffer his
house to be broken open

1240 Be you then also ready for at what hour you think not the Son
of man will come

1241 And Peter said to him Lord dost thou speak this parable to us
or likewise to all

1242 And the Lord said Who thinkest thou is the faithful and wise
steward whom his lord setteth over his family to give them their
measure of wheat in due season

1243 Blessed is that servant whom when his lord shall come he shall
find so doing

1244 Verily I say to you he will set him over all that he
possesseth

1245 But if that servant shall say in his heart My Lord is long a
coming and shall begin to strike the menservants and maidservants
and to eat and to drink and be drunk

1246 The lord of that servant will come in the day that he hopeth
not and at the hour that he knoweth not and shall separate him and
shall appoint him his portion with unbelievers

1247 And that servant who knew the will of his lord and prepared not
himself and did not according to his will shall be beaten with many
stripes

1248 But he that knew not and did things worthy of stripes shall be
beaten with few stripes And unto whomsoever much is given of him much
shall be required and to whom they have committed much of him they
will demand the more

1249 I am come to cast fire on the earth And what will I but that
it be kindled

1250 And I have a baptism wherewith I am to be baptized And how am I
straitened until it be accomplished

1251 Think ye that I am come to give peace on earth I tell you no
but separation

1252 For there shall be from henceforth five in one house divided
three against two and two against three

1253 The father shall be divided against the son and the son against
his father the mother against the daughter and the daughter against
her mother the motherinlaw against the daughterinlaw and the
daughterinlaw against her motherinlaw

1254 And he said also to the multitudes When you see a cloud rising
from the west presently you say A shower is coming And so it
happeneth

1255 And when ye see the south wind blow you say There will heat
And it cometh to pass

1256 You hypocrites you know how to discern the face of the heaven
and of the earth but how is it that you do not discern this time

1257 And why even of yourselves do you not judge that which is
just

1258 And when thou goest with thy adversary to the prince whilst
thou art in the way endeavour to be delivered from him lest perhaps
he draw thee to he judge and the judge deliver thee to the exacter
and the exacter cast thee into prison

1259 I say to thee thou shalt not go out thence until thou pay the
very last mite



Luke Chapter 13


The necessity of penance The barren fig tree The cure of the infirm
woman The journey to Jerusalem

131 And there were present at that very time some that told him of
the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices

132 And he answering said to them Think you that these Galileans
were sinners above all the men of Galilee because they suffered such
things

133 No I say to you but unless you shall do penance you shall all
likewise perish

134 Or those eighteen upon whom the tower fell in Siloe and slew
them think you that they also were debtors above all the men that
dwelt in Jerusalem

135 No I say to you but except you do penance you shall all
likewise perish

136 He spoke also this parable A certain man had a fig tree planted
in his vineyard and he came seeking fruit on it and found none

137 And he said to the dresser of the vineyard Behold for these
three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree and I find none Cut
it down therefore Why cumbereth it the ground

138 But he answering said to him Lord let it alone this year also
until I dig about it and dung it

139 And if happily it bear fruit but if not then after that thou
shalt cut it down

1310 And he was teaching in their synagogue on their sabbath

1311 And behold there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity
eighteen years And she was bowed together neither could she look
upwards at all

1312 Whom when Jesus saw he called her unto him and said to her
Woman thou art delivered from thy infirmity

1313 And he laid his hands upon her and immediately she was made
straight and glorified God

1314 And the ruler of the synagogue being angry that Jesus had healed
on the sabbath answering said to the multitude Six days there are
wherein you ought to work In them therefore come and be healed and
not on the sabbath day

1315 And the Lord answering him said Ye hypocrites doth not every
one of you on the sabbath day loose his ox or his ass from the manger
and lead them to water

1316 And ought not this daughter of Abraham whom Satan hath bound
lo these eighteen years be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day

1317 And when he said these things all his adversaries were ashamed
and all the people rejoiced for all the things that were gloriously
done by him

1318 He said therefore To what is the kingdom of God like and
whereunto shall I resemble it

1319 It is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and cast
into his garden and it grew and became a great tree and the birds of
the air lodged in the branches thereof

1320 And again he said Whereunto shall I esteem the kingdom of God
to be like

1321 It is like to leaven which a woman took and hid in three
measures of meal till the whole was leavened

1322 And he went through the cities and towns teaching and making his
journey to Jerusalem

1323 And a certain man said to him Lord are they few that are
saved But he said to them

1324 Strive to enter by the narrow gate for many I say to you
shall seek to enter and shall not be able

Shall seek etc  Shall desire to be saved but for want of taking
sufficient pains and being thoroughly in earnest shall not attain to
it

1325 But when the master of the house shall be gone in and shall shut
the door you shall begin to stand without and knock at the door
saying Lord open to us And he answering shall say to you I know
you not whence you are

1326 Then you shall begin to say We have eaten and drunk in thy
presence and thou hast taught in our streets

1327 And he shall say to you I know you not whence you are Depart
from me all ye workers of iniquity

1328 There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you shall see
Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of
God and you yourselves thrust out

1329 And there shall come from the east and the west and the north
and the south and shall sit down in the kingdom of God

1330 And behold they are last that shall be first and they are
first that shall be last

1331 The same day there came some of the Pharisees saying to him
Depart and get thee hence for Herod hath a mind to kill thee

1332 And he said to them Go and tell that fox Behold I cast out
devils and do cures today and tomorrow and the third day I am
consummated

1333 Nevertheless I must walk today and tomorrow and the day
following because it cannot be that a prophet perish out of
Jerusalem

1334 Jerusalem Jerusalem that killest the prophets and stonest
them that are sent to thee how often would I have gathered thy
children as the bird doth her brood under her wings and thou wouldest
not

1335 Behold your house shall be left to you desolate And I say to
you that you shall not see me till the time come when you shall say
Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord



Luke Chapter 14


Christ heals the dropsical man The parable of the supper The
necessity of renouncing all to follow Christ

141 And it came to pass when Jesus went into the house of one of the
Pharisees on the sabbath day that they watched him

142 And behold there was a certain man before him that had the
dropsy

143 And Jesus answering spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees saying
Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day

144 But they held their peace But he taking him healed him and sent
him away

145 And answering them he said Which of you shall have an ass or an
ox fall into a pit and will not immediately draw him out on the
sabbath day

146 And they could not answer him to these things

147 And he spoke a parable also to them that were invited marking
how they chose the first seats at the table saying to them

148 When thou art invited to a wedding sit not down in the first
place lest perhaps one more honourable than thou be invited by him

149 And he that invited thee and him come and say to thee Give this
man place And then thou begin with shame to take the lowest place

1410 But when thou art invited go sit down in the lowest place
that when he who invited thee cometh he may say to thee Friend go up
higher Then shalt thou have glory before them that sit at table with
thee

1411 Because every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled and he
that humbleth himself shall be exalted

1412 And he said to him also that had invited him When thou makest a
dinner or a supper call not thy friends nor thy brethren nor thy
kinsmen nor thy neighbours who are rich lest perhaps they also invite
thee again and a recompense be made to thee

1413 But when thou makest a feast call the poor the maimed the
lame and the blind

1414 And thou shalt be blessed because they have not wherewith to
make thee recompense for recompense shall be made thee at the
resurrection of the just

1415 When one of them that sat at table with him had heard these
things he said to him Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the
kingdom of God

1416 But he said to him A certain man made a great supper and
invited many

1417 And he sent his servant at the hour of supper to say to them
that were invited that they should come for now all things are ready

1418 And they began all at once to make excuse The first said to
him I have bought a farm and I must needs go out and see it I pray
thee hold me excused

1419 And another said I have bought five yoke of oxen and I go to
try them I pray thee hold me excused

1420 And another said I have married a wife and therefore I cannot
come

1421 And the servant returning told these things to his lord Then
the master of the house being angry said to his servant Go out
quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the
poor and the feeble and the blind and the lame

1422 And the servant said Lord it is done as thou hast commanded
and yet there is room

1423 And the Lord said to the servant Go out into the highways and
hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled

1424 But I say unto you that none of those men that were invited
shall taste of my supper

1425 And there went great multitudes with him And turning he said
to them

1426 If any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and
wife and children and brethren and sisters yea and his own life also
he cannot be my disciple

Hate not etc  The law of Christ does not allow us to hate even our
enemies much less our parents but the meaning of the text is that we
must be in that disposition of soul as to be willing to renounce and
part with every thing how near or dear soever it may be to us that
would keep us from following Christ

1427 And whosoever doth not carry his cross and come after me cannot
be my disciple

1428 For which of you having a mind to build a tower doth not first
sit down and reckon the charges that are necessary whether he have
wherewithal to finish it

1429 Lest after he hath laid the foundation and is not able to
finish it all that see it begin to mock him

1430 Saying This man began to build and was not able to finish

1431 Or what king about to go to make war against another king
doth not first sit down and think whether he be able with ten
thousand to meet him that with twenty thousand cometh against him

1432 Or else while the other is yet afar off sending an embassy he
desireth conditions of peace

1433 So likewise every one of you that doth not renounce all that he
possesseth cannot be my disciple

1434 Salt is good But if the salt shall lose its savour wherewith
shall it be seasoned

1435 It is neither profitable for the land nor for the dunghill but
shall be cast out He that hath ears to hear let him hear



Luke Chapter 15


The parables of the lost sheep and of the prodigal son

151 Now the publicans and sinners drew near unto him to hear him

152 And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured saying This man
receiveth sinners and eateth with them

153 And he spoke to them this parable saying

154 What man of you that hath an hundred sheep and if he shall lose
one of them doth he not leave the ninetynine in the desert and go
after that which was lost until he find it

155 And when he hath found it lay it upon his shoulders rejoicing

156 And coming home call together his friends and neighbours saying
to them Rejoice with me because I have found my sheep that was lost

157 I say to you that even so there shall be joy in heaven upon one
sinner that doth penance more than upon ninetynine just who need not
penance

158 Or what woman having ten groats if she lose one groat doth not
light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently until she find
it

159 And when she hath found it call together her friends and
neighbours saying Rejoice with me because I have found the groat
which I had lost

1510 So I say to you there shall be joy before the angels of God
upon one sinner doing penance

Before the angels  By this it is plain that the spirits in heaven
have a concern for us below and a joy at our repentance and
consequently a knowledge of it

1511 And he said A certain man had two sons

1512 And the younger of them said to his father Father give me the
portion of substance that falleth to me And he divided unto them his
substance

1513 And not many days after the younger son gathering all
together went abroad into a far country and there wasted his
substance living riotously

1514 And after he had spent all there came a mighty famine in that
country and he began to be in want

1515 And he went and cleaved to one of the citizens of that country
And he sent him into his farm to feed swine

1516 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks the swine
did eat and no man gave unto him

1517 And returning to himself he said How many hired servants in my
fathers house abound with bread and I here perish with hunger

1518 I will arise and will go to my father and say to him Father I
have sinned against heaven and before thee

1519 I am not worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy
hired servants

1520 And rising up he came to his father And when he was yet a
great way off his father saw him and was moved with compassion and
running to him fell upon his neck and kissed him

1521 And the son said to him Father I have sinned against heaven
and before thee I am not now worthy to be called thy son

1522 And the father said to his servants Bring forth quickly the
first robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on
his feet

1523 And bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat
and make merry

1524 Because this my son was dead and is come to life again was lost
and is found And they began to be merry

1525 Now his elder son was in the field and when he came and drew
nigh to the house he heard music and dancing

1526 And he called one of the servants and asked what these things
meant

1527 And he said to him Thy brother is come and thy father hath
killed the fatted calf because he hath received him safe

1528 And he was angry and would not go in His father therefore
coming out began to entreat him

1529 And he answering said to his father Behold for so many years
do I serve thee and I have never transgressed thy commandment and yet
thou hast never given me a kid to make merry with my friends

1530 But as soon as this thy son is come who hath devoured his
substance with harlots thou hast killed for him the fatted calf

1531 But he said to him Son thou art always with me and all I have
is thine

1532 But it was fit that we should make merry and be glad for this
thy brother was dead and is come to life again he was lost and is
found



Luke Chapter 16


The parable of the unjust steward and of the rich man and Lazarus

161 And he said also to his disciples There was a certain rich man
who had a steward and the same was accused unto him that he had
wasted his goods

162 And he called him and said to him How is it that I hear this of
thee Give an account of thy stewardship for now thou canst be steward
no longer

163 And the steward said within himself What shall I do because my
lord taketh away from me the stewardship To dig I am not able to beg
I am ashamed

164 I know what I will do that when I shall be removed from the
stewardship they may receive me into their houses

165 Therefore calling together every one of his lords debtors he
said to the first How much dost thou owe my lord

166 But he said An hundred barrels of oil And he said to him Take
thy bill and sit down quickly and write fifty

167 Then he said to another And how much dost thou owe Who said
An hundred quarters of wheat He said to him Take thy bill and write
eighty

168 And the lord commended the unjust steward forasmuch as he had
done wisely for the children of this world are wiser in their
generation than the children of light

169 And I say to you Make unto you friends of the mammon of
iniquity that when you shall fail they may receive you into
everlasting dwellings

Mammon of iniquity  Mammon signifies riches They are here called the
mammon of iniquity because oftentimes ill gotten ill bestowed or an
occasion of evil and at the best are but worldly and false and not
the true riches of a Christian They may receive  By this we see
that the poor servants of God whom we have relieved by our alms may
hereafter by their intercession bring our souls to heaven

1610 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in
that which is greater and he that is unjust in that which is little is
unjust also in that which is greater

1611 If then you have not been faithful in the unjust mammon who
will trust you with that which is the true

1612 And if you have not been faithful in that which is anothers
who will give you that which is your own

1613 No servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the
one and love the other or he will hold to the one and despise the
other You cannot serve God and mammon

1614 Now the Pharisees who were covetous heard all these things
and they derided him

1615 And he said to them you are they who justify yourselves before
men but God knoweth your hearts For that which is high to men is an
abomination before God

1616 The law and the prophets were until John From that time the
kingdom of God is preached and every one useth violence towards it

1617 And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of
the law to fall

1618 Every one that putteth away his wife and marrieth another
committeth adultery and he that marrieth her that is put away from her
husband committeth adultery

1619 There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine
linen and feasted sumptuously every day

1620 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus who lay at his
gate full of sores

1621 Desiring to be filled with the crumbs that fell from the rich
mans table And no one did give him moreover the dogs came and licked
his sores

1622 And it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the
angels into Abrahams bosom And the rich man also died and he was
buried in hell

Abrahams bosom  The place of rest where the souls of the saints
resided till Christ had opened heaven by his death

1623 And lifting up his eyes when he was in torments he saw Abraham
afar off and Lazarus in his bosom

1624 And he cried and said Father Abraham have mercy on me and send
Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water to cool my
tongue for I am tormented in this flame

1625 And Abraham said to him Son remember that thou didst receive
good things in thy lifetime and likewise Lazarus evil things but now
he is comforted and thou art tormented

1626 And besides all this between us and you there is fixed a great
chaos so that they who would pass from hence to you cannot nor from
thence come hither

1627 And he said Then father I beseech thee that thou wouldst send
him to my fathers house for I have five brethren

1628 That he may testify unto them lest they also come into this
place of torments

1629 And Abraham said to him They have Moses and the prophets Let
them hear them

1630 But he said No father Abraham but if one went to them from
the dead they will do penance

1631 And he said to him If they hear not Moses and the prophets
neither will they believe if one rise again from the dead



Luke Chapter 17


Lessons of avoiding scandal and of the efficacy of faith The ten
lepers The manner of the coming of Christ

171 And he said to his disciples It is impossible that scandals
should not come But woe to him through whom they come

172 It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his
neck and he cast into the sea than that he should scandalize one of
these little ones

173 Take heed to yourselves If thy brother sin against thee reprove
him and if he do penance forgive him

174 And if he sin against thee seven times in a day and seven times
in a day be converted unto thee saying I repent forgive him

175 And the apostles said to the Lord Increase our faith

176 And the Lord said If you had faith like to a grain of mustard
seed you might say to this mulberry tree Be thou rooted up and be
thou transplanted into the sea And it would obey you

177 But which of you having a servant ploughing or feeding cattle
will say to him when he is come from the field Immediately go Sit
down to meat

178 And will not rather say to him Make ready my supper and gird
thyself and serve me whilst I eat and drink and afterwards thou shalt
eat and drink

179 Doth he thank that servant for doing the things which he
commanded him

1710 I think not So you also when you shall have done all these
things that are commanded you say We are unprofitable servants we
have done that which we ought to do

Unprofitable servants  Because our service is of no profit to our
master and he justly claims it as our bounden duty But though we are
unprofitable to him our serving him is not unprofitable to us for he
is pleased to give by his grace a value to our good works which in
consequence of his promise entitles them to an eternal reward

1711 And it came to pass as he was going to Jerusalem he passed
through the midst of Samaria and Galilee

1712 And as he entered into a certain town there met him ten men
that were lepers who stood afar off

1713 And lifted up their voice saying Jesus Master have mercy on
us

1714 Whom when he saw he said Go shew yourselves to the priests
And it came to pass as they went they were made clean

1715 And one of them when he saw that he was made clean went back
with a loud voice glorifying God

1716 And he fell on his face before his feet giving thanks And this
was a Samaritan

1717 And Jesus answering said Were not ten made clean And where
are the nine

1718 There is no one found to return and give glory to God but this
stranger

1719 And he said to him Arise go thy way for thy faith hath made
thee whole

1720 And being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
come he answering them and said The kingdom of God cometh not with
observation

1721 Neither shall they say Behold here or behold there For lo
the kingdom of God is within you

1722 And he said to his disciples The days will come when you shall
desire to see one day of the Son of man And you shall not see it

1723 And they will say to you See here and see there Go ye not
after nor follow them

1724 For as the lightning that lighteneth from under heaven shineth
unto the parts that are under heaven so shall the Son of man be in his
day

1725 But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this
generation

1726 And as it came to pass in the days of Noe so shall it be also
in the days of the Son of man

1727 They did eat and drink they married wives and were given in
marriage until the day that Noe entered into the ark and the flood
came and destroyed them all

1728 Likewise as it came to pass in the days of Lot They did eat and
drink they bought and sold they planted and built

1729 And in the day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and
brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all

1730 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man shall be
revealed

1731 In that hour he that shall be on the housetop and his goods in
the house let him not go down to take them away and he that shall be
in the field in like manner let him not return back

1732 Remember Lots wife

1733 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and
whosoever shall lose it shall preserve it

1734 I say to you In that night there shall be two men in one bed
The one shall be taken and the other shall be left

1735 Two women shall be grinding together The one shall be taken and
the other shall be left Two men shall be in the field The one shall
be taken and the other shall be left

1736 They answering say to him Where Lord

1737 Who said to them Wheresoever the body shall be thither will
the eagles also be gathered together



Luke Chapter 18


We must pray always The Pharisee and the publican The danger of
riches The blind man is restored to sight

181 And he spoke also a parable to them that we ought always to pray
and not to faint

182 Saying There was a judge in a certain city who feared not God
nor regarded man

183 And there was a certain widow in that city and she came to him
saying Avenge me of my adversary

Avenge  That is do me justice It is a Hebraism

184 And he would not for a long time But afterwards he said within
himself Although I fear not God nor regard man

185 Yet because this widow is troublesome to me I will avenge her
lest continually coming she weary me

186 And the Lord said Hear what the unjust judge saith

187 And will not God revenge his elect who cry to him day and night
And will he have patience in their regard

188 I say to you that he will quickly revenge them But yet the Son
of man when he cometh shall he find think you faith on earth

189 And to some who trusted in themselves as just and despised
others he spoke also this parable

1810 Two men went up into the temple to pray the one a Pharisee and
the other a publican

1811 The Pharisee standing prayed thus with himself O God I give
thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men extortioners unjust
adulterers as also is this publican

1812 I fast twice in a week I give tithes of all that I possess

1813 And the publican standing afar off would not so much as lift
up his eyes towards heaven but struck his breast saying O God be
merciful to me a sinner

1814 I say to you this man went down into his house justified rather
than the other because every one that exalteth himself shall be
humbled and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted

1815 And they brought unto him also infants that he might touch
them Which when the disciples saw they rebuked them

1816 But Jesus calling them together said Suffer children to come
to me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God

1817 Amen I say to you Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of
God as a child shall not enter into it

1818 And a certain ruler asked him saying Good master what shall I
do to possess everlasting life

1819 And Jesus said to him Why dost thou call me good None is good
but God alone

1820 Thou knowest the commandments Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt
not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false
witness Honour thy father and mother

1821 Who said All these things have I kept from my youth

1822 Which when Jesus had heard he said to him Yet one thing is
wanting to thee Sell all whatever thou hast and give to the poor and
thou shalt have treasure in heaven And come follow me

1823 He having heard these things became sorrowful for he was very
rich

1824 And Jesus seeing him become sorrowful said How hardly shall
they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God

1825 For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle
than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God

1826 And they that heard it said Who then can be saved

1827 He said to them The things that are impossible with men are
possible with God

1828 Then Peter said Behold we have left all things and have
followed thee

1829 Who said to them Amen I say to you there is no man that hath
left home or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom
of Gods sake

1830 Who shall not receive much more in this present time and in the
world to come life everlasting

1831 Then Jesus took unto him the twelve and said to them Behold we
go up to Jerusalem and all things shall be accomplished which were
written by the prophets concerning the Son of man

1832 For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles and shall be mocked
and scourged and spit upon

1833 And after they have scourged him they will put him to death
And the third day he shall rise again

1834 And they understood none of these things and this word was hid
from them and they understood not the things that were said

1835 Now it came to pass when he drew nigh to Jericho that a
certain blind man sat by the way side begging

1836 And when he heard the multitude passing by he asked what this
meant

1837 And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by

1838 And he cried out saying Jesus Son of David have mercy on me

1839 And they that went before rebuked him that he should hold his
peace but he cried out much more Son of David have mercy on me

1840 And Jesus standing commanded him to be brought unto him And
when he was come near he asked him

1841 Saying What wilt thou that I do to thee But he said Lord
that I may see

1842 And Jesus said to him Receive thy sight thy faith hath made
thee whole

1843 And immediately he saw and followed him glorifying God And all
the people when they saw it gave praise to God



Luke Chapter 19


Zacheus entertains Christ The parable of the pounds Christ rides upon
an ass and weeps over Jerusalem

191 And entering he walked through Jericho

192 And behold there was a man named Zacheus who was the chief of
the publicans and he was rich

193 And he sought to see Jesus who he was and he could not for the
crowd because he was low of stature

194 And running before he climbed up into a sycamore tree that he
might see him for he was to pass that way

195 And when Jesus was come to the place looking up he saw him and
said to him Zacheus make haste and come down for this day I must
abide in thy house

196 And he made haste and came down and received him with joy

197 And when all saw it they murmured saying that he was gone to
be a guest with a man that was a sinner

198 But Zacheus standing said to the Lord Behold Lord the half of
my goods I give to the poor and if I have wronged any man of any
thing I restore him fourfold

199 Jesus said to him This day is salvation come to this house
because he also is a son of Abraham

1910 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was
lost

1911 As they were hearing these things he added and spoke a parable
because he was nigh to Jerusalem and because they thought that the
kingdom of God should immediately be manifested

1912 He said therefore a certain nobleman went into a far country
to receive for himself a kingdom and to return

1913 And calling his ten servants he gave them ten pounds and said
to them Trade till I come

He gave them ten pounds  In the original what is here translated a
pound is in Latin mina in value of our coin three pounds two
shillings and sixpence

1914 But his citizens hated him and they sent an embassage after him
saying We will not have this man to reign over us

1915 And it came to pass that he returned having received the
kingdom and he commanded his servants to be called to whom he had
given the money that he might know how much every man had gained by
trading

1916 And the first came saying Lord thy pound hath gained ten
pounds

1917 And he said to him Well done thou good servant because thou
hast been faithful in a little thou shalt have power over ten cities

1918 And the second came saying Lord thy pound hath gained five
pounds

1919 And he said to him Be thou also over five cities

1920 And another came saying Lord behold here is thy pound which
I have kept laid up in a napkin

1921 For I feared thee because thou art an austere man thou takest
up what thou didst not lay down and thou reapest that which thou didst
not sow

1922 He saith to him Out of thy own mouth I judge thee thou wicked
servant Thou knewest that I was an austere man taking up what I laid
not down and reaping that which I did not sow

1923 And why then didst thou not give my money into the bank that at
my coming I might have exacted it with usury

1924 And he said to them that stood by Take the pound away from him
and give it to him that hath ten pounds

1925 And they said to him Lord he hath ten pounds

1926 But I say to you that to every one that hath shall be given and
he shall abound and from him that hath not even that which he hath
shall be taken from him

1927 But as for those my enemies who would not have me reign over
them bring them hither and kill them before me

1928 And having said these things he went before going up to
Jerusalem

1929 And it came to pass when he was come nigh to Bethphage and
Bethania unto the mount called Olivet he sent two of his disciples

1930 Saying Go into the town which is over against you at your
entering into which you shall find the colt of an ass tied on which no
man ever hath sitten loose him and bring him hither

1931 And if any man shall ask you Why do you loose him You shall
say thus unto him Because the Lord hath need of his service

1932 And they that were sent went their way and found the colt
standing as he said unto them

1933 And as they were loosing the colt the owners thereof said to
them Why loose you the colt

1934 But they said Because the Lord hath need of him

1935 And they brought him to Jesus And casting their garments on the
colt they set Jesus thereon

1936 And as he went they spread their clothes underneath in the way

1937 And when he was now coming near the descent of Mount Olivet the
whole multitude of his disciples began with joy to praise God with a
loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen

1938 Saying Blessed be the king who cometh in the name of the Lord
Peace in heaven and glory on high

1939 And some of the Pharisees from amongst the multitude said to
him Master rebuke thy disciples

1940 To whom he said I say to you that if these shall hold their
peace the stones will cry out

1941 And when he drew near seeing the city he wept over it saying

1942 If thou also hadst known and that in this thy day the things
that are to thy peace but now they are hidden from thy eyes

1943 For the days shall come upon thee and thy enemies shall cast a
trench about thee and compass thee round and straiten thee on every
side

1944 And beat thee flat to the ground and thy children who are in
thee And they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone because
thou hast not known the time of thy visitation

1945 And entering into the temple he began to cast out them that
sold therein and them that bought

1946 Saying to them It is written My house is the house of prayer
But you have made it a den of thieves

1947 And he was teaching daily in the temple And the chief priests
and the scribes and the rulers of the people sought to destroy him

1948 And they found not what to do to him for all the people were
very attentive to hear him



Luke Chapter 20


The parable of the husbandmen Of paying tribute to Caesar and of the
resurrection of the dead

201 And it came to pass that on one of the days as he was teaching
the people in the temple and preaching the gospel the chief priests
and the scribes with the ancients met together

202 And spoke to him saying Tell us by what authority dost thou
these things Or who is he that hath given thee this authority

203 And Jesus answering said to them I will also ask you one thing
Answer me

204 The baptism of John was it from heaven or of men

205 But they thought within themselves saying If we shall say From
heaven he will say Why then did you not believe in him

206 But if we say of men the whole people will stone us For they
are persuaded that John was a prophet

207 And they answered that they knew not whence it was

208 And Jesus said to them Neither do I tell you by what authority I
do these things

209 And he began to speak to the people this parable A certain man
planted a vineyard and let it out to husbandmen and he was abroad for
a long time

2010 And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that they
should give him of the fruit of the vineyard Who beating him sent
him away empty

2011 And again he sent another servant But they beat him also and
treating him reproachfully sent him away empty

2012 And again he sent the third and they wounded him also and cast
him out

2013 Then the lord of the vineyard said What shall I do I will send
my beloved son It may be when they see him they will reverence him

2014 Whom when the husbandmen saw they thought within themselves
saying This is the heir Let us kill him that the inheritance may be
ours

2015 So casting him out of the vineyard they killed him What
therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them

2016 He will come and will destroy these husbandmen and will give the
vineyard to others Which they hearing said to him God forbid

2017 But he looking on them said What is this then that is written
The stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of
the corner

2018 Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be bruised and upon
whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder

2019 And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him
the same hour but they feared the people for they knew that he spoke
this parable to them

2020 And being upon the watch they sent spies who should feign
themselves just that they might take hold of him in his words that
they might deliver him up to the authority and power of the governor

2021 And they asked him saying Master we know that thou speakest
and teachest rightly and thou dost not respect any person but
teachest the way of God in truth

2022 Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar or no

2023 But he considering their guile said to them Why tempt you me

2024 Shew me a penny Whose image and inscription hath it They
answering said to him Caesars

2025 And he said to them Render therefore to Caesar the things that
are Caesars and to God the things that are Gods

2026 And they could not reprehend his word before the people and
wondering at his answer they held their peace

2027 And there came to him some of the Sadducees who deny that there
is any resurrection and they asked him

2028 Saying Master Moses wrote unto us If any mans brother die
having a wife and he leave no children that his brother should take
her to wife and raise up seed unto his brother

2029 There were therefore seven brethren and the first took a wife
and died without children

2030 And the next took her to wife and he also died childless

2031 And the third took her And in like manner all the seven and
they left no children and died

2032 Last of all the woman died also

2033 In the resurrection therefore whose wife of them shall she be
For all the seven had her to wife

2034 And Jesus said to them The children of this world marry and are
given in marriage

2035 But they that shall be accounted worthy of that world and of the
resurrection from the dead shall neither be married nor take wives

2036 Neither can they die any more for they are equal to the angels
and are the children of God being the children of the resurrection

2037 Now that the dead rise again Moses also shewed at the bush
when he called the Lord The God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and
the God of Jacob

2038 For he is not the God of the dead but of the living for all
live to him

2039 And some of the scribes answering said to him Master thou
hast said well

2040 And after that they durst not ask him any more questions

2041 But he said to them How say they that Christ is the son of
David

2042 And David himself saith in the book of Psalms The Lord said to
my Lord sit thou on my right hand

2043 Till I make thy enemies thy footstool

2044 David then calleth him Lord And how is he his son

2045 And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples

2046 Beware of the scribes who desire to walk in long robes and love
salutations in the market place and the first chairs in the synagogues
and the chief rooms at feasts

2047 Who devour the houses of widows feigning long prayer These
shall receive greater damnation



Luke Chapter 21


The widows mites The signs that should forerun the destruction of
Jerusalem and the end of the world

211 And looking on he saw the rich men cast their gifts into the
treasury

212 And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in two brass mites

213 And he said Verily I say to you that this poor widow hath cast
in more than they all

214 For all these have of their abundance cast into the offerings of
God but she of her want hath cast in all the living that she had

215 And some saying of the temple that it was adorned with goodly
stones and gifts he said

216 These things which you see the days will come in which there
shall not be left a stone upon a stone that shall not be thrown down

217 And they asked him saying Master when shall these things be
And what shall be the sign when they shall begin to come to pass

218 Who said Take heed you be not seduced for many will come in my
name saying I am he and the time is at hand Go ye not therefore
after them

219 And when you shall hear of wars and seditions be not terrified
These things must first come to pass but the end is not yet presently

2110 Then he said to them Nation shall rise against nation and
kingdom against kingdom

2111 And there shall be great earthquakes in divers places and
pestilences and famines and terrors from heaven and there shall be
great signs

2112 But before all these things they will lay their hands on you
and persecute you delivering you up to the synagogues and into
prisons dragging you before kings and governors for my names sake

2113 And it shall happen unto you for a testimony

2114 Lay it up therefore in your hearts not to meditate before how
you shall answer

2115 For I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your
adversaries shall not be able to resist and gainsay

2116 And you shall be betrayed by your parents and brethren and
kinsmen and friends and some of you they will put to death

2117 And you shall be hated by all men for my names sake

2118 But a hair of your head shall not perish

2119 In your patience you shall possess your souls

2120 And when you shall see Jerusalem compassed about with an army
then know that the desolation thereof is at hand

2121 Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains and those
who are in the midst thereof depart out and those who are in the
countries not enter into it

2122 For these are the days of vengeance that all things may be
fulfilled that are written

2123 But woe to them that are with child and give suck in those days
for there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this
people

2124 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led
away captives into all nations and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by
the Gentiles till the times of the nations be fulfilled

2125 And there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the
stars and upon the earth distress of nations by reason of the
confusion of the roaring of the sea and of the waves

2126 Men withering away for fear and expectation of what shall come
upon the whole world For the powers of heaven shall be moved

2127 And then they shall see the Son of man coming in a cloud with
great power and majesty

2128 But when these things begin to come to pass look up and lift up
your heads because your redemption is at hand

2129 And he spoke to them a similitude See the fig tree and all the
trees

2130 When they now shoot forth their fruit you know that summer is
nigh

2131 So you also when you shall see these things come to pass know
that the kingdom of God is at hand

2132 Amen I say to you this generation shall not pass away till all
things be fulfilled

2133 Heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass
away

2134 And take heed to yourselves lest perhaps your hearts be
overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and the cares of this life
and that day come upon you suddenly

2135 For as a snare shall it come upon all that sit upon the face of
the whole earth

2136 Watch ye therefore praying at all times that you may be
accounted worthy to escape all these things that are to come and to
stand before the Son of man

2137 And in the daytime he was teaching in the temple but at night
going out he abode in the mount that is called Olivet

2138 And all the people came early in the morning to him in the
temple to hear him



Luke Chapter 22


The treason of Judas The last supper The first part of the history of
the passion

221 Now the feast of unleavened bread which is called the pasch was
at hand

222 And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put
Jesus to death but they feared the people

223 And Satan entered into Judas who was surnamed Iscariot one of
the twelve

224 And he went and discoursed with the chief priests and the
magistrates how he might betray him to them

225 And they were glad and covenanted to give him money

226 And he promised And he sought opportunity to betray him in the
absence of the multitude

227 And the day of the unleavened bread came on which it was
necessary that the pasch should be killed

228 And he sent Peter and John saying Go and prepare for us the
pasch that we may eat

229 But they said Where wilt thou that we prepare

2210 And he said to them Behold as you go into the city there
shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water follow him into the
house where he entereth in

2211 And you shall say to the goodman of the house The master saith
to thee Where is the guest chamber where I may eat the pasch with my
disciples

2212 And he will shew you a large dining room furnished And there
prepare

2213 And they going found as he had said to them and made ready the
pasch

2214 And when the hour was come he sat down and the twelve apostles
with him

2215 And he said to them With desire I have desired to eat this
pasch with you before I suffer

2216 For I say to you that from this time I will not eat it till it
be fulfilled in the kingdom of God

2217 And having taken the chalice he gave thanks and said Take and
divide it among you

2218 For I say to you that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine
till the kingdom of God come

2219 And taking bread he gave thanks and brake and gave to them
saying This is my body which is given for you Do this for a
commemoration of me

Do this for a commemoration of me  This sacrifice and sacrament is to
be continued in the church to the end of the world to shew forth the
death of Christ until he cometh But this commemoration or
remembrance is by no means inconsistent with the real presence of his
body and blood under these sacramental veils which represent his
death on the contrary it is the manner that he himself hath
commanded of commemorating and celebrating his death by offering in
sacrifice and receiving in the sacrament that body and blood by which
we were redeemed

2220 In like manner the chalice also after he had supped saying
This is the chalice the new testament in my blood which shall be shed
for you

2221 But yet behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on
the table

2222 And the Son of man indeed goeth according to that which is
determined but yet woe to that man by whom he shall be betrayed

2223 And they began to inquire among themselves which of them it was
that should do this thing

2224 And there was also a strife amongst them which of them should
seem to be the greater

2225 And he said to them The kings of the Gentiles lord it over
them and they that have power over them are called beneficent

2226 But you not so but he that is the greater among you let him
become as the younger and he that is the leader as he that serveth

2227 For which is greater he that sitteth at table or he that
serveth Is not he that sitteth at table But I am in the midst of you
as he that serveth

2228 And you are they who have continued with me in my temptations

2229 And I dispose to you as my Father hath disposed to me a
kingdom

2230 That you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and may
sit upon thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel

2231 And the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to
have you that he may sift you as wheat

2232 But I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and thou
being once converted confirm thy brethren

2233 Who said to him Lord I am ready to go with thee both into
prison and to death

2234 And he said I say to thee Peter the cock shall not crow this
day till thou thrice deniest that thou knowest me And he said to
them

2235 When I sent you without purse and scrip and shoes did you want
anything

2236 But they said Nothing Then said he unto them But now he that
hath a purse let him take it and likewise a scrip and he that hath
not let him sell his coat and buy a sword

2237 For I say to you that this that is written must yet be fulfilled
in me And with the wicked was he reckoned For the things concerning
me have an end

2238 But they said Lord behold here are two swords And he said to
them It is enough

2239 And going out he went according to his custom to the Mount of
Olives And his disciples also followed him

2240 And when he was come to the place he said to them Pray lest
ye enter into temptation

2241 And he was withdrawn away from them a stones cast And kneeling
down he prayed

2242 Saying Father if thou wilt remove this chalice from me but
yet not my will but thine be done

2243 And there appeared to him an angel from heaven strengthening
him And being in an agony he prayed the longer

2244 And his sweat became as drops of blood trickling down upon the
ground

2245 And when he rose up from prayer and was come to the disciples
he found them sleeping for sorrow

2246 And he said to them Why sleep you Arise pray lest you
enter into temptation

2247 As he was yet speaking behold a multitude and he that was
called Judas one of the twelve went before them and drew near to
Jesus for to kiss him

2248 And Jesus said to him Judas dost thou betray the Son of man
with a kiss

2249 And they that were about him seeing what would follow said to
him Lord shall we strike with the sword

2250 And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut
off his right ear

2251 But Jesus answering said Suffer ye thus far And when he had
touched his ear he healed him

2252 And Jesus said to the chief priests and magistrates of the
temple and the ancients that were come unto him Are ye come out as
it were against a thief with swords and clubs

2253 When I was daily with you in the temple you did not stretch
forth your hands against me but this is your hour and the power of
darkness

2254 And apprehending him they led him to the high priests house
But Peter followed afar off

2255 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall and
were sitting about it Peter was in the midst of them

2256 Whom when a certain servant maid had seen sitting at the light
and had earnestly beheld him she said This man also was with him

2257 But he denied him saying Woman I know him not

2258 And after a little while another seeing him said Thou also
art one of them But Peter said O man I am not

Another etc  Observe here in order to reconcile the four
Evangelists that divers persons concurred in charging Peter with being
Christs disciple till at length they brought him to deny him thrice
1 The porteress that let him in and afterwards seeing him at the
fire first put the question to him and then positively affirmed that
he was with Christ 2 Another maid accused him to the standers by and
gave occasion to the man here mentioned to renew the charge against
him which caused the second denial 3 Others of the company took
notice of his being a Galilean and were seconded by the kinsman of
Malchus who affirmed he had seen him in the garden And this drew on
the third denial

2259 And after the space as it were of one hour another certain man
affirmed saying Of a truth this man was also with him for he is
also a Galilean

2260 And Peter said Man I know not what thou sayest And
immediately as he was yet speaking the cock crew

2261 And the Lord turning looked on Peter And Peter remembered the
word of the Lord as he had said Before the cock crow thou shalt deny
thrice

2262 And Peter going out wept bitterly

2263 And the men that held him mocked him and struck him

2264 And they blindfolded him and smote his face And they asked him
saying Prophesy Who is it that struck thee

2265 And blaspheming many other things they said against him

2266 And as soon as it was day the ancients of the people and the
chief priests and scribes came together And they brought him into
their council saying If thou be the Christ tell us

2267 And he saith to them If I shall tell you you will not believe
me

2268 And if I shall also ask you you will not answer me nor let me
go

2269 But hereafter the Son of man shall be sitting on the right hand
of the power of God

2270 Then said they all Art thou then the Son of God Who said You
say that I am

2271 And they said What need we any further testimony For we
ourselves have heard it from his own mouth



Luke Chapter 23


The continuation of the history of the passion

231 And the whole multitude of them rising up led him to Pilate

232 And they began to accuse him saying We have found this man
perverting our nation and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar and
saying that he is Christ the king

233 And Pilate asked him saying Art thou the king of the Jews But
he answering said Thou sayest it

234 And Pilate said to the chief priests and to the multitudes I
find no cause in this man

235 But they were more earnest saying He stirreth up the people
teaching throughout all Judea beginning from Galilee to this place

236 But Pilate hearing Galilee asked if the man were of Galilee

237 And when he understood that he was of Herods jurisdiction he
sent him away to Herod who was also himself at Jerusalem in those
days

238 And Herod seeing Jesus was very glad for he was desirous of a
long time to see him because he had heard many things of him and he
hoped to see some sign wrought by him

239 And he questioned him in many words But he answered him nothing

2310 And the chief priests and the scribes stood by earnestly
accusing him

2311 And Herod with his army set him at nought and mocked him
putting on him a white garment and sent him back to Pilate

2312 And Herod and Pilate were made friends that same day for
before they were enemies one to another

2313 And Pilate calling together the chief priests and the
magistrates and the people

2314 Said to them You have presented unto me this man as one that
perverteth the people And behold I having examined him before you
find no cause in this man in those things wherein you accuse him

2315 No nor Herod neither For I sent you to him and behold
nothing worthy of death is done to him

2316 I will chastise him therefore and release him

2317 Now of necessity he was to release unto them one upon the feast
day

2318 But the whole multitude together cried out saying Away with
this man and release unto us Barabbas

2319 Who for a certain sedition made in the city and for a murder
was cast into prison

2320 And Pilate again spoke to them desiring to release Jesus

2321 But they cried again saying Crucify him Crucify him

2322 And he said to them the third time Why what evil hath this man
done I find no cause of death in him I will chastise him therefore
and let him go

2323 But they were instant with loud voices requiring that he might
be crucified And their voices prevailed

2324 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required

2325 And he released unto them him who for murder and sedition had
been cast into prison whom they had desired But Jesus he delivered up
to their will

2326 And as they led him away they laid hold of one Simon of Cyrene
coming from the country and they laid the cross on him to carry after
Jesus

2327 And there followed him a great multitude of people and of women
who bewailed and lamented him

2328 But Jesus turning to them said Daughters of Jerusalem weep
not over me but weep for yourselves and for your children

2329 For behold the days shall come wherein they will say Blessed
are the barren and the wombs that have not borne and the paps that have
not given suck

2330 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains Fall upon us And
to the hills Cover us

2331 For if in the green wood they do these things what shall be
done in the dry

2332 And there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put
to death

2333 And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary
they crucified him there and the robbers one on the right hand and
the other on the left

2334 And Jesus said Father forgive them for they know not what
they do But they dividing his garments cast lots

2335 And the people stood beholding And the rulers with them derided
him saying He saved others let him save himself if he be Christ
the elect of God

2336 And the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him
vinegar

2337 And saying If thou be the king of the Jews save thyself

2338 And there was also a superscription written over him in letters
of Greek and Latin and Hebrew THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS

2339 And one of those robbers who were hanged blasphemed him saying
If thou be Christ save thyself and us

2340 But the other answering rebuked him saying Neither dost thou
fear God seeing thou art under the same condemnation

2341 And we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our
deeds But this man hath done no evil

2342 And he said to Jesus Lord remember me when thou shalt come
into thy kingdom

2343 And Jesus said to him Amen I say to thee This day thou shalt
be with me in paradise

In paradise  That is in the happy state of rest joy and peace
everlasting Christ was pleased by a special privilege to reward the
faith and confession of the penitent thief with a full discharge of
all his sins both as to the guilt and punishment and to introduce him
immediately after death into the happy society of the saints whose
limbo that is the place of their confinement was now made a paradise
by our Lords going thither

2344 And it was almost the sixth hour and there was darkness over
all the earth until the ninth hour

2345 And the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in
the midst

2346 And Jesus crying with a loud voice said Father into thy hands
I commend my spirit And saying this he gave up the ghost

2347 Now the centurion seeing what was done glorified God saying
Indeed this was a just man

2348 And all the multitude of them that were come together to that
sight and saw the things that were done returned striking their
breasts

2349 And all his acquaintance and the women that had followed him
from Galilee stood afar off beholding these things

2350 And behold there was a man named Joseph who was a counsellor a
good and a just man

2351 The same had not consented to their counsel and doings of
Arimathea a city of Judea who also himself looked for the kingdom of
God

2352 This man went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus

2353 And taking him down he wrapped him in fine linen and laid him
in a sepulchre that was hewed in stone wherein never yet any man had
been laid

2354 And it was the day of the Parasceve and the sabbath drew on

Parasceve  That is the eve or day of preparation for the sabbath

2355 And the women that were come with him from Galilee following
after saw the sepulchre and how his body was laid

2356 And returning they prepared spices and ointments and on the
sabbath day they rested according to the commandment



Luke Chapter 24


Christs resurrection and manifestation of himself to his disciples

241 And on the first day of the week very early in the morning they
came to the sepulchre bringing the spices which they had prepared

242 And they found the stone rolled back from the sepulchre

243 And going in they found not the body of the Lord Jesus

244 And it came to pass as they were astonished in their mind at
this behold two men stood by them in shining apparel

245 And as they were afraid and bowed down their countenance towards
the ground they said unto them Why seek you the living with the dead

246 He is not here but is risen Remember how he spoke unto you
when he was yet in Galilee

247 Saying The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful
men and be crucified and the third day rise again

248 And they remembered his words

249 And going back from the sepulchre they told all these things to
the eleven and to all the rest

2410 And it was Mary Magdalen and Joanna and Mary of James and the
other women that were with them who told these things to the apostles

2411 And these words seemed to them as idle tales and they did not
believe them

2412 But Peter rising up ran to the sepulchre and stooping down he
saw the linen cloths laid by themselves and went away wondering in
himself at that which was come to pass

2413 And behold two of them went the same day to a town which was
sixty furlongs from Jerusalem named Emmaus

2414 And they talked together of all these things which had happened

2415 And it came to pass that while they talked and reasoned with
themselves Jesus himself also drawing near went with them

2416 But their eyes were held that they should not know him

2417 And he said to them What are these discourses that you hold one
with another as you walk and are sad

2418 And the one of them whose name was Cleophas answering said to
him Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and hast not known the
things that have been done there in these days

2419 To whom he said What things And they said Concerning Jesus
of Nazareth who was a prophet mighty in work and word before God and
all the people

2420 And how our chief priests and princes delivered him to be
condemned to death and crucified him

2421 But we hoped that it was he that should have redeemed Israel
And now besides all this today is the third day since these things
were done

2422 Yea and certain women also of our company affrighted us who
before it was light were at the sepulchre

2423 And not finding his body came saying that they had all seen a
vision of angels who say that he is alive

2424 And some of our people went to the sepulchre and found it so as
the women had said but him they found not

2425 Then he said to them O foolish and slow of heart to believe in
all things Which the prophets have spoken

2426 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things and so to enter
into his glory

2427 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded to
them in all the scriptures the things that were concerning him

2428 And they drew nigh to the town whither they were going and he
made as though he would go farther

2429 But they constrained him saying Stay with us because it is
towards evening and the day is now far spent And he went in with them

2430 And it came to pass whilst he was at table with them he took
bread and blessed and brake and gave to them

2431 And their eyes were opened and they knew him And he vanished
out of their sight

2432 And they said one to the other Was not our heart burning within
us whilst he spoke in the way and opened to us the scriptures

2433 And rising up the same hour they went back to Jerusalem and
they found the eleven gathered together and those that were with them

2434 Saying The Lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to Simon

2435 And they told what things were done in the way and how they
knew him in the breaking of bread

2436 Now whilst they were speaking these things Jesus stood in the
midst of them and saith to them Peace be to you It is I Fear not

2437 But they being troubled and frightened supposed that they saw a
spirit

2438 And he said to them Why are you troubled and why do thoughts
arise in your hearts

2439 See my hands and feet that it is I myself Handle and see for
a spirit hath not flesh and bones as you see me to have

2440 And when he had said this he shewed them his hands and feet

2441 But while they yet believed not and wondered for joy he said
Have you here any thing to eat

2442 And they offered him a piece of a broiled fish and a honeycomb

2443 And when he had eaten before them taking the remains he gave
to them

2444 And he said to them These are the words which I spoke to you
while I was yet with you that all things must needs be fulfilled which
are written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the psalms
concerning me

2445 Then he opened their understanding that they might understand
the scriptures

2446 And he said to them Thus it is written and thus it behoved
Christ to suffer and to rise again from the dead the third day

2447 And that penance and remission of sins should be preached in his
name unto all nations beginning at Jerusalem

2448 And you are witnesses of these things

2449 And I send the promise of my Father upon you but stay you in
the city till you be endued with power from on high

The promise of my Father  that is the Holy Ghost whom Christ had
promised that his Father and he would send John 14 26 and 17 7

2450 And he led them out as far as Bethania and lifting up his
hands he blessed them

2451 And it came to pass whilst he blessed them he departed from
them and was carried up to heaven

2452 And they adoring went back into Jerusalem with great joy

2453 And they were always in the temple praising and blessing God
Amen




THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST JOHN



St John the Apostle and Evangelist was the son of Zebedee and Salome
brother to James the Greater He was called the Beloved disciple of
Christ and stood by at his Crucifixion He wrote the Gospel after the
other Evangelists about sixtythree years after our Lords Ascension
Many things that they had omitted were supplied by him The original
was written in Greek and by the Greeks he is titled The Divine St
Jerome relates that when he was earnestly requested by the brethren to
write the Gospel he answered he would do it if by ordering a common
fast they would all put up their prayers together to the Almighty God
which being ended replenished with the clearest and fullest revelation
coming from Heaven he burst forth into that preface IN THE BEGINNING
WAS THE WORD



John Chapter 1


The divinity and incarnation of Christ John bears witness of him He
begins to call his disciples

11 In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the
Word was God

12 The same was in the beginning with God

13 All things were made by him and without him was made nothing that
was made

14 In him was life and the life was the light of men

15 And the light shineth in darkness and the darkness did not
comprehend it

16 There was a man sent from God whose name was John

17 This man came for a witness to give testimony of the light that
all men might believe through him

18 He was not the light but was to give testimony of the light

19 That was the true light which enlighteneth every man that cometh
into this world

110 He was in the world and the world was made by him and the world
knew him not

111 He came unto his own and his own received him not

112 But as many as received him he gave them power to be made the
sons of God to them that believe in his name

113 Who are born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of
the will of man but of God

114 And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we saw his
glory the glory as it were of the only begotten of the Father full
of grace and truth

115 John beareth witness of him and crieth out saying This was he
of whom I spoke He that shall come after me is preferred before me
because he was before me

116 And of his fulness we all have received and grace for grace

117 For the law was given by Moses grace and truth came by Jesus
Christ

118 No man hath seen God at any time the only begotten Son who is in
the Bosom of the Father he hath declared him

119 And this is the testimony of John when the Jews sent from
Jerusalem priests and Levites to him to ask him Who art thou

120 And he confessed and did not deny and he confessed I am not the
Christ

121 And they asked him What then Art thou Elias And he said I
am not Art thou the prophet And he answered No

122 They said therefore unto him Who art thou that we may give an
answer to them that sent us What sayest thou of thyself

123 He said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make
straight the way of the Lord as said the prophet Isaias

124 And they that were sent were of the Pharisees

125 And they asked him and said to him Why then dost thou baptize
if thou be not Christ nor Elias nor the prophet

126 John answered them saying I baptize with water but there hath
stood one in the midst of you whom you know not

127 The same is he that shall come after me who is preferred before
me the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to loose

128 These things were done in Bethania beyond the Jordan where John
was baptizing

129 The next day John saw Jesus coming to him and he saith Behold
the Lamb of God Behold him who taketh away the sin of the world

130 This is he of whom I said After me there cometh a man who is
preferred before me because he was before me

131 And I knew him not but that he may be made manifest in Israel
therefore am I come baptizing with water

132 And John gave testimony saying I saw the Spirit coming down as
a dove from heaven and he remained upon him

133 And I knew him not but he who sent me to baptize with water said
to me He upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining
upon him he it is that baptizeth with the Holy Ghost

134 And I saw and I gave testimony that this is the Son of God

135 The next day again John stood and two of his disciples

136 And beholding Jesus walking he saith Behold the Lamb of God

137 And the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus

138 And Jesus turning and seeing them following him saith to them
What seek you Who said to him Rabbi which is to say being
interpreted Master where dwellest thou

139 He saith to them Come and see They came and saw where he abode
and they stayed with him that day Now it was about the tenth hour

140 And Andrew the brother of Simon Peter was one of the two who
had heard of John and followed him

141 He findeth first his brother Simon and saith to him We have
found the Messias which is being interpreted the Christ

142 And he brought him to Jesus And Jesus looking upon him said
Thou art Simon the son of Jona Thou shalt be called Cephas which is
interpreted Peter

143 On the following day he would go forth into Galilee and he
findeth Philip And Jesus saith to him follow me

144 Now Philip was of Bethsaida the city of Andrew and Peter

145 Philip findeth Nathanael and saith to him We have found him of
whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write Jesus the son of
Joseph of Nazareth

146 And Nathanael said to him Can any thing of good come from
Nazareth Philip saith to him Come and see

147 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and he saith of him Behold an
Israelite indeed in whom there is no guile

148 Nathanael saith to him Whence knowest thou me Jesus answered
and said to him Before that Philip called thee when thou wast under
the fig tree I saw thee

149 Nathanael answered him and said Rabbi Thou art the Son of God
Thou art the King of Israel

150 Jesus answered and said to him Because I said unto thee I saw
thee under the fig tree thou believest greater things than these
shalt thou see

151 And he saith to him Amen amen I say to you you shall see the
heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the
Son of man



John Chapter 2


Christ changes water into wine He casts the sellers out of the temple

21 And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee and
the mother of Jesus was there

22 And Jesus also was invited and his disciples to the marriage

23 And the wine failing the mother of Jesus saith to him They have
no wine

24 And Jesus saith to her Woman what is that to me and to thee My
hour is not yet come

What is that to me etc  These words of our Saviour spoken to his
mother have been understood by some commentators as harsh they not
considering the next following verse Whatsoever he shall say to you
do ye which plainly shows that his mother knew of the miracle that he
was to perform and that it was at her request he wrought it besides
the manner of speaking the words as to the tone and the countenance
shown at the same time which could only be known to those who were
present or from what had followed for words indicating anger in one
tone of voice would be understood quite the reverse in another

25 His mother saith to the waiters Whatsoever he shall say to you
do ye

26 Now there were set there six waterpots of stone according to the
manner of the purifying of the Jews containing two or three measures
apiece

27 Jesus saith to them Fill the waterpots with water And they
filled them up to the brim

28 And Jesus saith to them Draw out now and carry to the chief
steward of the feast And they carried it

29 And when the chief steward had tasted the water made wine and knew
not whence it was but the waiters knew who had drawn the water the
chief steward calleth the bridegroom

210 And saith to him Every man at first setteth forth good wine and
when men have well drunk then that which is worse But thou hast kept
the good wine until now

211 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee and
manifested his glory And his disciples believed in him

212 After this he went down to Capharnaum he and his mother and his
brethren and his disciples and they remained there not many days

213 And the pasch of the Jews was at hand and Jesus went up to
Jerusalem

214 And he found in the temple them that sold oxen and sheep and
doves and the changers of money sitting

215 And when he had made as it were a scourge of little cords he
drove them all out of the temple the sheep also and the oxen and the
money of the changers he poured out and the tables he overthrew

216 And to them that sold doves he said Take these things hence and
make not the house of my Father a house of traffic

217 And his disciples remembered that it was written The zeal of
thy house hath eaten me up

218 The Jews therefore answered and said to him What sign dost
thou shew unto us seeing thou dost these things

219 Jesus answered and said to them Destroy this temple and in
three days I will raise it up

220 The Jews then said Six and forty years was this temple in
building and wilt thou raise it up in three days

221 But he spoke of the temple of his body

222 When therefore he was risen again from the dead his disciples
remembered that he had said this and they believed the scripture and
the word that Jesus had said

223 Now when he was at Jerusalem at the pasch upon the festival
day many believed in his name seeing his signs which he did

224 But Jesus did not trust himself unto them for that he knew all
men

225 And because he needed not that any should give testimony of man
for he knew what was in man



John Chapter 3


Christs discourse with Nicodemus Johns testimony

31 And there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of
the Jews

32 This man came to Jesus by night and said to him Rabbi we know
that thou art come a teacher from God for no man can do these signs
which thou dost unless God be with him

33 Jesus answered and said to him Amen amen I say to thee unless
a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God

34 Nicodemus saith to him How can a man be born when he is old Can
he enter a second time into his mothers womb and be born again

35 Jesus answered Amen amen I say to thee unless a man be born
again of water and the Holy Ghost he cannot enter into the kingdom of
God

Unless a man be born again etc  By these words our Saviour hath
declared the necessity of baptism and by the word water it is evident
that the application of it is necessary with the words Matt 28 19

36 That which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born
of the Spirit is spirit

37 Wonder not that I said to thee You must be born again

38 The Spirit breatheth where he will and thou hearest his voice but
thou knowest not whence he cometh and whither he goeth So is every one
that is born of the Spirit

39 Nicodemus answered and said to him How can these things be done

310 Jesus answered and said to him Art thou a master in Israel and
knowest not these things

311 Amen amen I say to thee that we speak what we know and we
testify what we have seen and you receive not our testimony

312 If I have spoken to you earthly things and you believe not how
will you believe if I shall speak to you heavenly things

313 And no man hath ascended into heaven but he that descended from
heaven the Son of man who is in heaven

314 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert so must the Son
of man be lifted up

315 That whosoever believeth in him may not perish but may have life
everlasting

316 For God so loved the world as to give his only begotten Son
that whosoever believeth in him may not perish but may have life
everlasting

317 For God sent not his Son into the world to judge the world but
that the world may be saved by him

318 He that believeth in him is not judged But he that doth not
believe is already judged because he believeth not in the name of the
only begotten Son of God

Is not judged  He that believeth viz by a faith working through
charity is not judged that is is not condemned but the obstinate
unbeliever is judged that is condemned already by retrenching
himself from the society of Christ and his church

319 And this is the judgment Because the light is come into the
world and men loved darkness rather than the light for their works
were evil

The judgment  That is the cause of his comdemnation

320 For every one that doth evil hateth the light and cometh not to
the light that his works may not be reproved

321 But he that doth truth cometh to the light that his works may be
made manifest because they are done in God

He that doth truth  that is he that acteth according to truth which
here signifies the Law of God Thy law is truth Psa 118 142

322 After these things Jesus and his disciples came into the land of
Judea and there he abode with them and baptized

323 And John also was baptizing in Ennon near Salim because there
was much water there And they came and were baptized

324 For John was not yet cast into prison

325 And there arose a question between some of Johns disciples and
the Jews concerning purification

326 And they came to John and said to him Rabbi he that was with
thee beyond the Jordan to whom thou gavest testimony behold he
baptizeth and all men come to him

327 John answered and said A man cannot receive any thing unless it
be given him from heaven

328 You yourselves do bear me witness that I said that I am not
Christ but that I am sent before him

329 He that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the
bridegroom who standeth and heareth Him rejoiceth with joy because of
the bridegrooms voice This my joy therefore is fulfilled

330 He must increase but I must decrease

331 He that cometh from above is above all He that is of the earth
of the earth he is and of the earth he speaketh He that cometh from
heaven is above all

332 And what he hath seen and heard that he testifieth and no man
receiveth his testimony

333 He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God
is true

334 For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God for God doth
not give the Spirit by measure

335 The Father loveth the Son and he hath given all things into his
hand

336 He that believeth in the Son hath life everlasting but he that
believeth not the Son shall not see life but the wrath of God abideth
on him



John Chapter 4


Christ talks with the Samaritan woman He heals the rulers son

41 When Jesus therefore understood the Pharisees had heard that Jesus
maketh more disciples and baptizeth more than John

42 Though Jesus himself did not baptize but his disciples

43 He left Judea and went again into Galilee

44 And he was of necessity to pass through Samaria

45 He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria which is called Sichar
near the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph

46 Now Jacobs well was there Jesus therefore being wearied with
his journey sat thus on the well It was about the sixth hour

47 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus saith to
her Give me to drink

48 For his disciples were gone into the city to buy meats

49 Then that Samaritan woman saith to him How dost thou being a
Jew ask of me to drink who am a Samaritan woman For the Jews do not
communicate with the Samaritans

410 Jesus answered and said to her If thou didst know the gift of
God and who he is that saith to thee Give me to drink thou perhaps
wouldst have asked of him and he would have given thee living water

411 The woman saith to him Sir thou hast nothing wherein to draw
and the well is deep From whence then hast thou living water

412 Art thou greater than our father Jacob who gave us the well and
drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle

413 Jesus answered and said to her Whosoever drinketh of this water
shall thirst again but he that shall drink of the water that I will
give him shall not thirst for ever

414 But the water that I will give him shall become in him a fountain
of water springing up into life everlasting

415 The woman said to him Sir give me this water that I may not
thirst nor come hither to draw

416 Jesus saith to her Go call thy husband and come hither

417 The woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus said to
her Thou hast said well I have no husband

418 For thou hast had five husbands and he whom thou now hast is not
thy husband This thou hast said truly

419 The woman saith to him Sir I perceive that thou art a prophet

420 Our fathers adored on this mountain and you say that at
Jerusalem is the place where men must adore

This mountain  Garizim where the Samaritans had their schismatical
temple

421 Jesus saith to her Woman believe me that the hour cometh when
you shall neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem adore the Father

422 You adore that which you know not we adore that which we know
For salvation is of the Jews

423 But the hour cometh and now is when the true adorers shall adore
the Father in spirit and in truth For the Father also seeketh such to
adore him

424 God is a spirit and they that adore him must adore him in spirit
and in truth

425 The woman saith to him I know that the Messias cometh who is
called Christ therefore when he is come he will tell us all things

426 Jesus saith to her I am he who am speaking with thee

427 And immediately his disciples came And they wondered that he
talked with the woman Yet no man said What seekest thou Or Why
talkest thou with her

428 The woman therefore left her waterpot and went her way into the
city and saith to the men there

429 Come and see a man who has told me all things whatsoever I have
done Is not he the Christ

430 They went therefore out of the city and came unto him

431 In the mean time the disciples prayed him saying Rabbi eat

432 But he said to them I have meat to eat which you know not

433 The disciples therefore said one to another Hath any man brought
him to eat

434 Jesus saith to them My meat is to do the will of him that sent
me that I may perfect his work

435 Do not you say There are yet four months and then the harvest
cometh Behold I say to you lift up your eyes and see the countries
For they are white already to harvest

436 And he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto life
everlasting that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice
together

437 For in this is the saying true That it is one man that soweth
and it is another that reapeth

438 I have sent you to reap that in which you did not labour Others
have laboured and you have entered into their labours

439 Now of that city many of the Samaritans believed in him for the
word of the woman giving testimony He told me all things whatsoever I
have done

440 So when the Samaritans were come to him they desired that he
would tarry there And he abode there two days

441 And many more believed in him because of his own word

442 And they said to the woman We now believe not for thy saying
for we ourselves have heard him and know that this is indeed the
Saviour of the world

443 Now after two days he departed thence and went into Galilee

444 For Jesus himself gave testimony that a prophet hath no honour in
his own country

445 And when he was come into Galilee the Galileans received him
having seen all the things he had done at Jerusalem on the festival
day for they also went to the festival day

446 He came again therefore into Cana of Galilee where he made the
water wine And there was a certain ruler whose son was sick at
Capharnaum

447 He having heard that Jesus was come from Judea into Galilee sent
to him and prayed him to come down and heal his son for he was at the
point of death

448 Jesus therefore said to him Unless you see signs and wonders
you believe not

449 The ruler saith to him Lord come down before that my son die

450 Jesus saith to him Go thy way Thy son liveth The man believed
the word which Jesus said to him and went his way

451 And as he was going down his servants met him and they brought
word saying that his son lived

452 He asked therefore of them the hour wherein he grew better And
they said to him Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him

453 The father therefore knew that it was at the same hour that Jesus
said to him Thy son liveth And himself believed and his whole house

454 This is again the second miracle that Jesus did when he was come
out of Judea into Galilee



John Chapter 5


Christ heals on the sabbath the man languishing thirtyeight years His
discourse upon this occasion

51 After these things was a festival day of the Jews and Jesus went
up to Jerusalem

52 Now there is at Jerusalem a pond called Probatica which in
Hebrew is named Bethsaida having five porches

Probatica  That is the sheep pond either so called because the
sheep were washed therein that were to be offered up in sacrifice in
the temple or because it was near the sheep gate That this was a pond
where miracles were wrought is evident from the sacred text and also
that the water had no natural virtue to heal as one only of those put
in after the motion of the water was restored to health for if the
water had the healing quality the others would have the like benefit
being put into it about the same time

53 In these lay a great multitude of sick of blind of lame of
withered waiting for the moving of the water

54 And an angel of the Lord descended at certain times into the pond
and the water was moved And he that went down first into the pond
after the motion of the water was made whole of whatsoever infirmity he
lay under

55 And there was a certain man there that had been eight and thirty
years under his infirmity

56 Him when Jesus had seen lying and knew that he had been now a
long time he saith to him Wilt thou be made whole

57 The infirm man answered him Sir I have no man when the water is
troubled to put me into the pond For whilst I am coming another
goeth down before me

58 Jesus saith to him Arise take up thy bed and walk

59 And immediately the man was made whole and he took up his bed and
walked And it was the sabbath that day

510 The Jews therefore said to him that was healed It is the
sabbath It is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed

511 He answered them He that made me whole he said to me Take up
thy bed and walk

512 They asked him therefore Who is that man who said to thee Take
up thy bed and walk

513 But he who was healed knew not who it was for Jesus went aside
from the multitude standing in the place

514 Afterwards Jesus findeth him in the temple and saith to him
Behold thou art made whole sin no more lest some worse thing happen
to thee

515 The man went his way and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had
made him whole

516 Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus because he did these
things on the sabbath

517 But Jesus answered them My Father worketh until now and I work

518 Hereupon therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him because
he did not only break the sabbath but also said God was his Father
making himself equal to God

519 Then Jesus answered and said to them Amen amen I say unto you
the Son cannot do any thing of himself but what he seeth the Father
doing for what things soever he doth these the Son also doth in like
manner

520 For the Father loveth the Son and sheweth him all things which
himself doth and greater works than these will he shew him that you
may wonder

521 For as the Father raiseth up the dead and giveth life so the Son
also giveth life to whom he will

522 For neither does the Father judge any man but hath given all
judgment to the Son

523 That all men may honour the Son as they honour the Father He
who honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father who hath sent him

524 Amen amen I say unto you that he who heareth my word and
believeth him that sent me hath life everlasting and cometh not into
judgment but is passed from death to life

525 Amen amen I say unto you that the hour cometh and now is
when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that
hear shall live

526 For as the Father hath life in himself so he hath given to the
Son also to have life in himself

527 And he hath given him power to do judgment because he is the Son
of man

528 Wonder not at this for the hour cometh wherein all that are in
the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God

529 And they that have done good things shall come forth unto the
resurrection of life but they that have done evil unto the
resurrection of judgment

Unto the resurrection of judgment  That is condemnation

530 I cannot of myself do any thing As I hear so I judge And my
judgment is just because I seek not my own will but the will of him
that sent me

531 If I bear witness of myself my witness is not true

532 There is another that beareth witness of me and I know that the
witness which he witnesseth of me is true

533 You sent to John and he gave testimony to the truth

534 But I receive not testimony from man but I say these things
that you may be saved

535 He was a burning and a shining light and you were willing for a
time to rejoice in his light

536 But I have a greater testimony than that of John for the works
which the Father hath given me to perfect the works themselves which I
do give testimony of me that the Father hath sent me

537 And the Father himself who hath sent me hath given testimony of
me neither have you heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape

538 And you have not his word abiding in you for whom he hath sent
him you believe not

539 Search the scriptures for you think in them to have life
everlasting And the same are they that give testimony of me

Or  You search the scriptures Scrutamini  It is not a command for
all to read the scriptures but a reproach to the Pharisees that
reading the scriptures as they did and thinking to find everlasting
life in them they would not receive him to whom all those scriptures
gave testimony and through whom alone they could have that true life

540 And you will not come to me that you may have life

541 I receive not glory from men

542 But I know you that you have not the love of God in you

543 I am come in the name of my Father and you receive me not if
another shall come in his own name him you will receive

544 How can you believe who receive glory one from another and the
glory which is from God alone you do not seek

545 Think not that I will accuse you to the Father There is one that
accuseth you Moses in whom you trust

546 For if you did believe Moses you would perhaps believe me also
for he wrote of me

547 But if you do not believe his writings how will you believe my
words



John Chapter 6


Christ feeds five thousand with five loaves He walks upon the sea and
discourses of the bread of life

61 After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee which is
that of Tiberias

62 And a great multitude followed him because they saw the miracles
which he did on them that were diseased

63 Jesus therefore went up into a mountain and there he sat with his
disciples

64 Now the pasch the festival day of the Jews was near at hand

65 When Jesus therefore had lifted up his eyes and seen that a very
great multitude cometh to him he said to Philip Whence shall we buy
bread that these may eat

66 And this he said to try him for he himself knew what he would do

67 Philip answered him Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not
sufficient for them that every one may take a little

68 One of his disciples Andrew the brother of Simon Peter saith to
him

69 There is a boy here that hath five barley loaves and two fishes
But what are these among so many

610 Then Jesus said Make the men sit down Now there was much grass
in the place The men therefore sat down in number about five
thousand

611 And Jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he
distributed to them that were set down In like manner also of the
fishes as much as they would

612 And when they were filled he said to his disciples gather up
the fragments that remain lest they be lost

613 They gathered up therefore and filled twelve baskets with the
fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above to
them that had eaten

614 Now those men when they had seen what a miracle Jesus had done
said This is of a truth the prophet that is to come into the world

615 Jesus therefore when he knew that they would come to take him by
force and make him king fled again into the mountains himself alone

616 And when evening was come his disciples went down to the sea

617 And when they had gone up into a ship they went over the sea to
Capharnaum And it was now dark and Jesus was not come unto them

618 And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew

619 When they had rowed therefore about five and twenty or thirty
furlongs they see Jesus walking upon the sea and drawing nigh to the
ship And they were afraid

620 But he saith to them It is I Be not afraid

621 They were willing therefore to take him into the ship And
presently the ship was at the land to which they were going

622 The next day the multitude that stood on the other side of the
sea saw that there was no other ship there but one and that Jesus had
not entered into the ship with his disciples but that his disciples
were gone away alone

623 But other ships came in from Tiberias nigh unto the place where
they had eaten the bread the Lord giving thanks

624 When therefore the multitude saw that Jesus was not there nor
his disciples they took shipping and came to Capharnaum seeking for
Jesus

625 And when they had found him on that other side of the sea they
said to him Rabbi when camest thou hither

626 Jesus answered them and said Amen amen I say to you you seek
me not because you have seen miracles but because you did eat of the
loaves and were filled

627 Labour not for the meat which perisheth but for that which
endureth unto life everlasting which the Son of man will give you For
him hath God the Father sealed

628 They said therefore unto him What shall we do that we may work
the works of God

629 Jesus answered and said to them This is the work of God that
you believe in him whom he hath sent

630 They said therefore to him What sign therefore dost thou shew
that we may see and may believe thee What dost thou work

631 Our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written He
gave them bread from heaven to eat

632 Then Jesus said to them Amen amen I say to you Moses gave you
not bread from heaven but my Father giveth you the true bread from
heaven

633 For the bread of God is that which cometh down from heaven and
giveth life to the world

634 They said therefore unto him Lord give us always this bread

635 And Jesus said to them I am the bread of life He that cometh to
me shall not hunger and he that believeth in me shall never thirst

636 But I said unto you that you also have seen me and you believe
not

637 All that the Father giveth to me shall come to me and him that
cometh to me I will not cast out

638 Because I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the
will of him that sent me

639 Now this is the will of the Father who sent me that of all that
he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again
in the last day

640 And this is the will of my Father that sent me that every one
who seeth the Son and believeth in him may have life everlasting And I
will raise him up in the last day

641 The Jews therefore murmured at him because he had said I am the
living bread which came down from heaven

642 And they said Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father
and mother we know How then saith he I came down from heaven

643 Jesus therefore answered and said to them Murmur not among
yourselves

644 No man can come to me except the Father who hath sent me draw
him And I will raise him up in the last day

Draw him  Not by compulsion nor by laying the free will under any
necessity but by the strong and sweet motions of his heavenly grace

645 It is written in the prophets And they shall all be taught of
God Every one that hath heard of the Father and hath learned cometh
forth me

646 Not that any man hath seen the Father but he who is of God he
hath seen the Father

647 Amen amen I say unto you He that believeth in me hath
everlasting life

648 I am the bread of life

649 Your fathers did eat manna in the desert and are dead

650 This is the bread which cometh down from heaven that if any man
eat of it he may not die

651 I am the living bread which came down from heaven

652 If any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever and the
bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world

653 The Jews therefore strove among themselves saying How can this
man give us his flesh to eat

654 Then Jesus said to them Amen amen I say unto you except you
eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood you shall not have
life in you

Except you eatand drink etc  To receive the body and blood of
Christ is a divine precept insinuated in this text which the
faithful fulfil though they receive but in one kind because in one
kind they receive both body and blood which cannot be separated from
each other Hence life eternal is here promised to the worthy
receiving though but in one kind Ver 52 If any man eat of this
bread he shall live for ever and the bread that I will give is my
flesh for the life of the world Ver 58 He that eateth me the same
also shall live by me Ver 59 He that eateth this bread shall liver
for ever

655 He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath everlasting
life and I will raise him up in the last day

656 For my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed

657 He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me and
I in him

658 As the living Father hath sent me and I live by the Father so he
that eateth me the same also shall live by me

659 This is the bread that came down from heaven Not as your fathers
did eat manna and are dead He that eateth this bread shall live for
ever

660 These things he said teaching in the synagogue in Capharnaum

661 Many therefore of his disciples hearing it said This saying is
hard and who can hear it

662 But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at
this said to them Doth this scandalize you

663 If then you shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was
before

If then you shall see etc  Christ by mentioning his ascension by
this instance of his power and divinity would confirm the truth of
what he had before asserted and at the same time correct their gross
apprehension of eating his flesh and drinking his blood in a vulgar
and carnal manner by letting them know he should take his whole body
living with him to heaven and consequently not suffer it to be as they
supposed divided mangled and consumed upon earth

664 It is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing
The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life

The flesh profiteth nothing  Dead flesh separated from the spirit in
the gross manner they supposed they were to eat his flesh would profit
nothing Neither doth mans flesh that is to say mans natural and
carnal apprehension which refuses to be subject to the spirit and
words of Christ profit any thing But it would be the height of
blasphemy to say the living flesh of Christ which we receive in the
blessed sacarament with his spirit that is with his soul and
divinity profiteth nothing For if Christs flesh had profitedus
nothing he would never have taken flesh for us nor died in us
nothing he would never have taken flesh for us nor died in the flesh
for us Are spirit and life  By proposing to you a heavenly
sacrament in which you shall receive in a wonderful manner spirit
grace and life in its very fountain

665 But there are some of you that believe not For Jesus knew from
the beginning who they were that did not believe and who he was that
would betray him

666 And he said Therefore did I say to you that no man can come to
me unless it be given him by my Father

667 After this many of his disciples went back and walked no more
with him

668 Then Jesus said to the twelve Will you also go away

669 And Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go Thou
hast the words of eternal life

670 And we have believed and have known that thou art the Christ the
Son of God

671 Jesus answered them Have not I chosen you twelve And one of you
is a devil

672 Now he meant Judas Iscariot the son of Simon for this same was
about to betray him whereas he was one of the twelve



John Chapter 7


Christ goes up to the feast of the tabernacles He teaches in the
temple

71 After these things Jesus walked in Galilee for he would not walk
in Judea because the Jews sought to kill him

72 Now the Jews feast of tabernacles was at hand

73 And his brethren said to him Pass from hence and go into Judea
that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou dost

74 For there is no man that doth any thing in secret and he himself
seeketh to be known openly If thou do these things manifest thyself
to the world

75 For neither did his brethren believe in him

76 Then Jesus said to them My time is not yet come but your time is
always ready

77 The world cannot hate you but me it hateth because I give
testimony of it that the works thereof are evil

78 Go you up to this festival day but I go not up to this festival
day because my time is not accomplished

79 When he had said these things he himself stayed in Galilee

710 But after his brethren were gone up then he also went up to the
feast not openly but as it were in secret

711 The Jews therefore sought him on the festival day and said Where
is he

712 And there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him
For some said He is a good man And others said No but he seduceth
the people

713 Yet no man spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews

714 Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple
and taught

715 And the Jews wondered saying How doth this man know letters
having never learned

716 Jesus answered them and said My doctrine is not mine but his
that sent me

717 If any man will do the will of him he shall know of the
doctrine whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself

718 He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory but he that
seeketh the glory of him that sent him he is true and there is no
injustice in him

719 Did not Moses give you the law and yet none of you keepeth the
law

720 Why seek you to kill me The multitude answered and said Thou
hast a devil Who seeketh to kill thee

721 Jesus answered and said to them One work I have done and you
all wonder

722 Therefore Moses gave you circumcision not because it is of
Moses but of the fathers and on the sabbath day you circumcise a
man

723 If a man receive circumcision on the sabbath day that the law of
Moses may not be broken are you angry at me because I have healed the
whole man on the sabbath day

724 Judge not according to the appearance but judge just judgment

725 Some therefore of Jerusalem said Is not this he whom they seek
to kill

726 And behold he speaketh openly and they say nothing to him Have
the rulers known for a truth that this is the Christ

727 But we know this man whence he is but when the Christ cometh
no man knoweth whence he is

728 Jesus therefore cried out in the temple teaching and saying You
both know me and you know whence I am And I am not come of myself
but he that sent me is true whom you know not

729 I know him because I am from him and he hath sent me

730 They sought therefore to apprehend him and no man laid hands on
him because his hour was not yet come

731 But of the people many believed in him and said When the Christ
cometh shall he do more miracles than this man doth

732 The Pharisees heard the people murmuring these things concerning
him and the rulers and Pharisees sent ministers to apprehend him

733 Jesus therefore said to them Yet a little while I am with you
and then I go to him that sent me

734 You shall seek me and shall not find me and where I am thither
you cannot come

735 The Jews therefore said among themselves Whither will he go
that we shall not find him Will he go unto the dispersed among the
Gentiles and teach the Gentiles

736 What is this saying that he hath said You shall seek me and
shall not find me And Where I am you cannot come

737 And on the last and great day of the festivity Jesus stood and
cried saying If any man thirst let him come to me and drink

738 He that believeth in me as the scripture saith Out of his belly
shall flow rivers of living water

739 Now this he said of the Spirit which they should receive who
believed in him for as yet the Spirit was not given because Jesus was
not yet glorified

740 Of that multitude therefore when they had heard these words of
his some said This is the prophet indeed

741 Others said This is the Christ But some said Doth the Christ
come out of Galilee

742 Doth not the scripture say That Christ cometh of the seed of
David and from Bethlehem the town where David was

743 So there arose a dissension among the people because of him

744 And some of them would have apprehended him but no man laid
hands upon him

745 The ministers therefore came to the chief priests and the
Pharisees And they said to them Why have you not brought him

746 The ministers answered Never did man speak like this man

747 The Pharisees therefore answered them Are you also seduced

748 Hath any one of the rulers believed in him or of the Pharisees

749 But this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed

750 Nicodemus said to them he that came to him by night who was one
of them

751 Doth our law judge any man unless it first hear him and know
what he doth

752 They answered and said to him Art thou also a Galilean Search
the scriptures and see that out of Galilee a prophet riseth not

753 And every man returned to his own house



John Chapter 8


The woman taken in adultery Christ justifies his doctrine

81 And Jesus went unto mount Olivet

82 And early in the morning he came again into the temple and all
the people came to him And sitting down he taught them

83 And the scribes and Pharisees bring unto him a woman taken in
adultery and they set her in the midst

84 And said to him Master this woman was even now taken in
adultery

85 Now Moses in the law commanded us to stone such a one But what
sayest thou

86 And this they said tempting him that they might accuse him But
Jesus bowing himself down wrote with his finger on the ground

87 When therefore they continued asking him he lifted up himself and
said to them He that is without sin among you let him first cast a
stone at her

88 And again stooping down he wrote on the ground

89 But they hearing this went out one by one beginning at the
eldest And Jesus alone remained and the woman standing in the midst

810 Then Jesus lifting up himself said to her Woman where are they
that accused thee Hath no man condemned thee

811 Who said No man Lord And Jesus said Neither will I condemn
thee Go and now sin no more

812 Again therefore Jesus spoke to them saying I am the light of
the world He that followeth me walketh not in darkness but shall have
the light of life

813 The Pharisees therefore said to him Thou givest testimony of
thyself Thy testimony is not true

814 Jesus answered and said to them Although I give testimony of
myself my testimony is true for I know whence I came and whither I
go

815 You judge according to the flesh I judge not any man

816 And if I do judge my judgment is true because I am not alone
but I and the Father that sent me

817 And in your law it is written that the testimony of two men is
true

818 I am one that give testimony of myself and the Father that sent
me giveth testimony of me

819 They said therefore to him Where is thy Father Jesus answered
Neither me do you know nor my Father If you did know me perhaps you
would know my Father also

820 These words Jesus spoke in the treasury teaching in the temple
and no man laid hands on him because his hour was not yet come

821 Again therefore Jesus said to them I go and you shall seek me
And you shall die in your sin Whither I go you cannot come

822 The Jews therefore said Will he kill himself because he said
Whither I go you cannot come

823 And he said to them You are from beneath I am from above You
are of this world I am not of this world

824 Therefore I said to you that you shall die in your sins For if
you believe not that I am he you shall die in your sin

825 They said therefore to him Who art thou Jesus said to them
The beginning who also speak unto you

826 Many things I have to speak and to judge of you But he that sent
me is true and the things I have heard of him these same I speak in
the world

827 And they understood not that he called God his Father

828 Jesus therefore said to them When you shall have lifted up the
Son of man then shall you know that I am he and that I do nothing of
myself But as the Father hath taught me these things I speak

829 And he that sent me is with me and he hath not left me alone
For I do always the things that please him

830 When he spoke these things many believed in him

831 Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed him If you continue
in my word you shall be my disciples indeed

832 And you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free

833 They answered him We are the seed of Abraham and we have never
been slaves to any man How sayest thou You shall be free

834 Jesus answered them Amen amen I say unto you that whosoever
committeth sin is the servant of sin

835 Now the servant abideth not in the house for ever but the son
abideth for ever

836 If therefore the son shall make you free you shall be free
indeed

837 I know that you are the children of Abraham but you seek to kill
me because my word hath no place in you

838 I speak that which I have seen with my Father and you do the
things that you have seen with your father

839 They answered and said to him Abraham is our father Jesus saith
them If you be the children of Abraham do the works of Abraham

840 But now you seek to kill me a man who have spoken the truth to
you which I have heard of God This Abraham did not

841 You do the works of your father They said therefore to him We
are not born of fornication we have one Father even God

842 Jesus therefore said to them If God were your Father you would
indeed love me For from God I proceeded and came For I came not of
myself but he sent me

843 Why do you not know my speech Because you cannot hear my word

844 You are of your father the devil and the desires of your father
you will do He was a murderer from the beginning and he stood not in
the truth because truth is not in him When he speaketh a lie he
speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father thereof

845 But if I say the truth you believe me not

846 Which of you shall convince me of sin If I say the truth to you
why do you not believe me

847 He that is of God heareth the words of God Therefore you hear
them not because you are not of God

848 The Jews therefore answered and said to him Do not we say well
that thou art a Samaritan and hast a devil

849 Jesus answered I have not a devil but I honour my Father And
you have dishonoured me

850 But I seek not my own glory there is one that seeketh and
judgeth

851 Amen amen I say to you If any man keep my word he shall not
see death for ever

852 The Jews therefore said Now we know that thou hast a devil
Abraham is dead and the prophets and thou sayest If any man keep my
word he shall not taste death for ever

853 Art thou greater than our father Abraham who is dead And the
prophets are dead Whom dost thou make thyself

854 Jesus answered If I glorify myself my glory is nothing It is
my Father that glorifieth me of whom you say that he is your God

855 And you have not known him but I know him And if I shall say
that I know him not I shall be like to you a liar But I do know him
and do keep his word

856 Abraham your father rejoiced that he might see my day he saw it
and was glad

857 The Jews therefore said to him Thou art not yet fifty years old
And hast thou seen Abraham

858 Jesus said to them Amen amen I say to you before Abraham was
made I AM

859 They took up stones therefore to cast at him But Jesus hid
himself and went out of the temple



John Chapter 9


He gives sight to the man born blind

91 And Jesus passing by saw a man who was blind from his birth

92 And his disciples asked him Rabbi who hath sinned this man or
his parents that he should be born blind

93 Jesus answered Neither hath this man sinned nor his parents but
that the works of God should be made manifest in him

94 I must work the works of him that sent me whilst it is day the
night cometh when no man can work

95 As long as I am in the world I am the light of the world

96 When he had said these things he spat on the ground and made clay
of the spittle and spread the clay upon his eyes

97 And said to him Go wash in the pool of Siloe which is
interpreted Sent He went therefore and washed and he came seeing

98 The neighbours therefore and they who had seen him before that
he was a beggar said Is not this he that sat and begged Some said
This is he

99 But others said No but he is like him But he said I am he

910 They said therefore to him How were thy eyes opened

911 He answered That man that is called Jesus made clay and anointed
my eyes and said to me Go to the pool of Siloe and wash And I went
I washed and I see

912 And they said to him Where is he He saith I know not

913 They bring him that had been blind to the Pharisees

914 Now it was the sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his
eyes

915 Again therefore the Pharisees asked him how he had received his
sight But he said to them He put clay upon my eyes and I washed
and I see

916 Some therefore of the Pharisees said This man is not of God who
keepeth not the sabbath But others said How can a man that is a
sinner do such miracles And there was a division among them

917 They say therefore to the blind man again What sayest thou of
him that hath opened thy eyes And he said He is a prophet

918 The Jews then did not believe concerning him that he had been
blind and had received his sight until they called the parents of him
that had received his sight

919 And asked them saying Is this your son who you say was born
blind How then doth he now see

920 His parents answered them and said We know that this is our son
and that he was born blind

921 But how he now seeth we know not or who hath opened his eyes
we know not Ask himself he is of age Let him speak for himself

922 These things his parents said because they feared the Jews for
the Jews had already agreed among themselves that if any man should
confess him to be Christ he should be put out of the synagogue

923 Therefore did his parents say He is of age Ask himself

924 They therefore called the man again that had been blind and said
to him Give glory to God We know that this man is a sinner

925 He said therefore to them If he be a sinner I know not One
thing I know that whereas I was blind now I see

926 They said then to him What did he to thee How did he open thy
eyes

927 He answered them I have told you already and you have heard
Why would you hear it again Will you also become his disciples

928 They reviled him therefore and said Be thou his disciple but we
are the disciples of Moses

929 We know that God spoke to Moses but as to this man we know not
from whence he is

930 The man answered and said to them why herein is a wonderful
thing that you know not from whence he is and he hath opened my eyes

931 Now we know that God doth not hear sinners but if a man be a
server of God and doth his will him he heareth

932 From the beginning of the world it hath not been heard that any
man hath opened the eyes of one born blind

933 Unless this man were of God he could not do anything

934 They answered and said to him Thou wast wholly born in sins and
dost thou teach us And they cast him out

935 Jesus heard that they had cast him out And when he had found
him he said to him Dost thou believe in the Son of God

936 He answered and said Who is he Lord that I may believe in
him

937 And Jesus said to him Thou hast both seen him and it is he that
talketh with thee

938 And he said I believe Lord And falling down he adored him

939 And Jesus said For judgment I am come into this world that they
who see not may see and they who see may become blind

I am come etc  Not that Christ came for that end that any one
should be made blind but that the Jews by the abuse of his coming
and by their not receiving him brought upon themselves this judgment
of blindness

940 And some of the Pharisees who were with him heard and they
said unto him Are we also blind

941 Jesus said to them If you were blind you should not have sin
but now you say We see Your sin remaineth

If you were blind etc  If you were invincibly ignorant and had
neither read the scriptures nor seen my miracles you would not be
guilty of the sin of infidelity but now as you boast of your
knowledge of the scriptures you are inexcusable



John Chapter 10


Christ is the door and the good shepherd He and his Father are one

101 Amen amen I say to you He that entereth not by the door into
the sheepfold but climbeth up another way the same is a thief and a
robber

102 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep

103 To him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice And he
calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out

104 And when he hath let out his own sheep he goeth before them and
the sheep follow him because they know his voice

105 But a stranger they follow not but fly from him because they
know not the voice of strangers

106 This proverb Jesus spoke to them But they understood not what he
spoke

107 Jesus therefore said to them again Amen amen I say to you I
am the door of the sheep

108 All others as many as have come are thieves and robbers and
the sheep heard them not

109 I am the door By me if any man enter in he shall be saved and
he shall go in and go out and shall find pastures

1010 The thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to
destroy I am come that they may have life and may have it more
abundantly

1011 I am the good shepherd The good shepherd giveth his life for
his sheep

1012 But the hireling and he that is not the shepherd whose own the
sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and flieth
and the wolf casteth and scattereth the sheep

1013 And the hireling flieth because he is a hireling and he hath
no care for the sheep

1014 I am the good shepherd and I know mine and mine know me

1015 As the Father knoweth me and I know the Father and I lay down
my life for my sheep

1016 And other sheep I have that are not of this fold them also I
must bring And they shall hear my voice And there shall be one fold
and one shepherd

1017 Therefore doth the Father love me because I lay down my life
that I may take it again

1018 No man taketh it away from me but I lay it down of myself And
I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it up again This
commandment have I received of my Father

1019 A dissension rose again among the Jews for these words

1020 And many of them said He hath a devil and is mad Why hear you
him

1021 Others said These are not the words of one that hath a devil
Can a devil open the eyes of the blind

1022 And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem and it was
winter

1023 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomons porch

1024 The Jews therefore came round about him and said to him How
long dost thou hold our souls in suspense If thou be the Christ tell
us plainly

1025 Jesus answered them I speak to you and you believe not the
works that I do in the name of my Father they give testimony of me

1026 But you do not believe because you are not of my sheep

1027 My sheep hear my voice And I know them and they follow me

1028 And I give them life everlasting and they shall not perish for
ever And no man shall pluck them out of my hand

1029 That which my Father hath given me is greater than all and no
one can snatch them out of the hand of my Father

1030 I and the Father are one

I and the Father are one  That is one divine nature but two
distinct persons

1031 The Jews then took up stones to stone him

1032 Jesus answered them Many good works I have shewed you from my
Father For which of those works do you stone me

1033 The Jews answered him For a good work we stone thee not but
for blasphemy and because that thou being a man makest thyself God

1034 Jesus answered them Is it not written in your law I said you
are gods

1035 If he called them gods to whom the word of God was spoken and
the scripture cannot be broken

1036 Do you say of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into
the world Thou blasphemest because I said I am the Son of God

1037 If I do not the works of my Father believe me not

1038 But if I do though you will not believe me believe the works
that you may know and believe that the Father is in me and I in the
Father

1039 They sought therefore to take him and he escaped out of their
hands

1040 And he went again beyond the Jordan into that place where John
was baptizing first And there he abode

1041 And many resorted to him and they said John indeed did no
sign

1042 But all things whatsoever John said of this man were true And
many believed n him



John Chapter 11


Christ raises Lazarus to life The rulers resolve to put him to death

111 Now there was a certain man sick named Lazarus of Bethania of
the town of Mary and of Martha her sister

112 And Mary was she that anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped
his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick

113 His sisters therefore sent to him saying Lord behold he whom
thou lovest is sick

114 And Jesus hearing it said to them This sickness is not unto
death but for the glory of God that the Son of God may be glorified
by it

115 Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister Mary and Lazarus

116 When he had heard therefore that he was sick he still remained
in the same place two days

117 Then after that he said to his disciples Let us go into Judea
again

118 The disciples say to him Rabbi the Jews but now sought to stone
thee And goest thou thither again

119 Jesus answered Are there not twelve hours of the day If a man
walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this
world

1110 But if he walk in the night he stumbleth because the light is
not in him

1111 These things he said and after that he said to them Lazarus
our friend sleepeth but I go that I may awake him out of sleep

1112 His disciples therefore said Lord if he sleep he shall do
well

1113 But Jesus spoke of his death and they thought that he spoke of
the repose of sleep

1114 Then therefore Jesus said to them plainly Lazarus is dead

1115 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there that you
may believe But let us go to him

1116 Thomas therefore who is called Didymus said to his fellow
disciples Let us also go that we may die with him

1117 Jesus therefore came and found that he had been four days
already in the grave

1118 Now Bethania was near Jerusalem about fifteen furlongs off

1119 And many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary to comfort
them concerning their brother

1120 Martha therefore as soon as she heard that Jesus was come went
to meet him but Mary sat at home

1121 Martha therefore said to Jesus Lord if thou hadst been here
my brother had not died

1122 But now also I know that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God God
will give it thee

1123 Jesus saith to her Thy brother shall rise again

1124 Martha saith to him I know that he shall rise again in the
resurrection at the last day

1125 Jesus said to her I am the resurrection and the life he that
believeth in me although he be dead shall live

1126 And every one that liveth and believeth in me shall not die for
ever Believest thou this

1127 She saith to him Yea Lord I have believed that thou art
Christ the Son of the living God who art come into this world

1128 And when she had said these things she went and called her
sister Mary secretly saying The master is come and calleth for thee

1129 She as soon as she heard this riseth quickly and cometh to
him

1130 For Jesus was not yet come into the town but he was still in
that place where Martha had met him

1131 The Jews therefore who were with her in the house and comforted
her when they saw Mary that she rose up speedily and went out
followed her saying She goeth to the grave to weep there

1132 When Mary therefore was come where Jesus was seeing him she
fell down at his feet and saith to him Lord if thou hadst been here
my brother had not died

1133 Jesus therefore when he saw her weeping and the Jews that
were come with her weeping groaned in the spirit and troubled himself

1134 And said Where have you laid him They say to him Lord come
and see

1135 And Jesus wept

1136 The Jews therefore said Behold how he loved him

1137 But some of them said Could not he that opened the eyes of the
man born blind have caused that this man should not die

1138 Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the
sepulchre Now it was a cave and a stone was laid over it

1139 Jesus saith Take away the stone Martha the sister of him that
was dead saith to him Lord by this time he stinketh for he is now
of four days

1140 Jesus saith to her Did not I say to thee that if thou believe
thou shalt see the glory of God

1141 They took therefore the stone away And Jesus lifting up his
eyes said Father I give thee thanks that thou hast heard me

1142 And I knew that thou hearest me always but because of the
people who stand about have I said it that they may believe that thou
hast sent me

1143 When he had said these things he cried with a loud voice
Lazarus come forth

1144 And presently he that had been dead came forth bound feet and
hands with winding bands And his face was bound about with a napkin
Jesus said to them Loose him and let him go

1145 Many therefore of the Jews who were come to Mary and Martha and
had seen the things that Jesus did believed in him

1146 But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things
that Jesus had done

1147 The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a
council and said What do we for this man doth many miracles

1148 If we let him alone so all will believe in him and the Romans
will come and take away our place and nation

1149 But one of them named Caiphas being the high priest that year
said to them You know nothing

1150 Neither do you consider that it is expedient for you that one
man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not

1151 And this he spoke not of himself but being the high priest of
that year he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation

1152 And not only for the nation but to gather together in one the
children of God that were dispersed

1153 From that day therefore they devised to put him to death

1154 Wherefore Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews but he
went into a country near the desert unto a city that is called Ephrem
And there he abode with his disciples

1155 And the pasch of the Jews was at hand and many from the country
went up to Jerusalem before the pasch to purify themselves

1156 They sought therefore for Jesus and they discoursed one with
another standing in the temple What think you that he is not come to
the festival day And the chief priests and Pharisees had given a
commandment that if any man knew where he was he should tell that
they might apprehend him



John Chapter 12


The anointing of Christs feet His riding into Jerusalem upon an ass
A voice from heaven

121 Jesus therefore six days before the pasch came to Bethania
where Lazarus had been dead whom Jesus raised to life

122 And they made him a supper there and Martha served But Lazarus
was one of them that were at table with him

123 Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of right spikenard of
great price and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her
hair And the house was filled with the odour of the ointment

124 Then one of his disciples Judas Iscariot he that was about to
betray him said

125 Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence and given
to the poor

126 Now he said this not because he cared for the poor but because
he was a thief and having the purse carried the things that were put
therein

127 Jesus therefore said Let her alone that she may keep it against
the day of my burial

128 For the poor you have always with you but me you have not
always

See the annotation of St Matt 26 11

129 A great multitude therefore of the Jews knew that he was there
and they came not for Jesus sake only but that they might see
Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead

1210 But the chief priests thought to kill Lazarus also

1211 Because many of the Jews by reason of him went away and
believed in Jesus

1212 And on the next day a great multitude that was come to the
festival day when they had heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem

1213 Took branches of palm trees and went forth to meet him and cried
Hosanna Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord the king of
Israel

1214 And Jesus found a young ass and sat upon it as it is written

1215 Fear not daughter of Sion behold thy king cometh sitting on
an asss colt

1216 These things his disciples did not know at the first but when
Jesus was glorified then they remembered that these things were
written of him and that they had done these things to him

1217 The multitude therefore gave testimony which was with him when
he called Lazarus out of the grave and raised him from the dead

1218 For which reason also the people came to meet him because they
heard that he had done this miracle

1219 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves Do you see that
we prevail nothing Behold the whole world is gone after him

1220 Now there were certain Gentiles among them who came up to adore
on the festival day

1221 These therefore came to Philip who was of Bethsaida of Galilee
and desired him saying Sir we would see Jesus

1222 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew Again Andrew and Philip told
Jesus

1223 But Jesus answered them saying The hour is come that the Son
of man should be glorified

1224 Amen amen I say to you unless the grain of wheat falling into
the ground die

1225 Itself remaineth alone But if it die it bringeth forth much
fruit He that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his
life in this world keepeth it unto life eternal

1226 If any man minister to me let him follow me and where I am
there also shall my minister be If any man minister to me him will my
Father honour

1227 Now is my soul troubled And what shall I say Father save me
from this hour But for this cause I came unto this hour

1228 Father glorify thy name A voice therefore came from heaven I
have both glorified it and will glorify it again

1229 The multitude therefore that stood and heard said that it
thundered Others said An angel spoke to him

1230 Jesus answered and said This voice came not because of me but
for your sakes

1231 Now is the judgment of the world now shall the prince of this
world be cast out

1232 And I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all things to
myself

1233 Now this he said signifying what death he should die

1234 The multitude answered him We have heard out of the law that
Christ abideth for ever And how sayest thou The Son of man must be
lifted up Who is this Son of man

1235 Jesus therefore said to them Yet a little while the light is
among you Walk whilst you have the light and the darkness overtake
you not And he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither be goeth

1236 Whilst you have the light believe in the light that you may be
the children of light These things Jesus spoke and he went away and
hid himself from them

1237 And whereas he had done so many miracles before them they
believed not in him

1238 That the saying of Isaias the prophet might be fulfilled which
he said Lord who hath believed our hearing And to whom hath the arm
of the Lord been revealed

1239 Therefore they could not believe because Isaias said again

They could not believe  Because they would not saith St Augustine
Tract 33 in Joan See the annotation St Mark 4 12

1240 He hath blinded their eyes and hardened their heart that they
should not see with their eyes nor understand with their heart and be
converted and I should heal them

1241 These things said Isaias when he saw his glory and spoke of
him

1242 However many of the chief men also believed in him but because
of the Pharisees they did not confess him that they might not be cast
out of the synagogue

1243 For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God

1244 But Jesus cried and said He that believeth in me doth not
believe in me but in him that sent me

1245 And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me

1246 I am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth in
me may not remain in darkness

1247 And if any man hear my words and keep them not I do not judge
him for I came not to judge the world but to save the world

1248 He that despiseth me and receiveth not my words hath one that
judgeth him The word that I have spoken the same shall judge him in
the last day

1249 For I have not spoken of myself but the Father who sent me he
gave me commandment what I should say and what I should speak

1250 And I know that his commandment is life everlasting The things
therefore that I speak even as the Father said unto me so do I speak



John Chapter 13


Christ washes his disciples feet The treason of Judas The new
commandment of love

131 Before the festival day of the pasch Jesus knowing that his hour
was come that he should pass out of this world to the Father having
loved his own who were in the world he loved them unto the end

Before the festival day of the pasch  This was the fourth and last
pasch of the ministry of Christ and according to the common
computation was in the thirtythird year of our Lord and in the year
of the world 4036 Some chronologers are of opinion that our Saviour
suffered in the thirtyseventh year of his age but these different
opinions on this subject are of no consequence

132 And when supper was done the devil having now put into the heart
of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon to betray him

133 Knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands
and that he came from God and goeth to God

134 He riseth from supper and layeth aside his garments and having
taken a towel girded himself

135 After that he putteth water into a basin and began to wash the
feet of the disciples and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was
girded

136 He cometh therefore to Simon Peter And Peter saith to him Lord
dost thou wash my feet

137 Jesus answered and said to him What I do thou knowest not now
but thou shalt know hereafter

138 Peter saith to him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered
him If I wash thee not thou shalt have no part with me

139 Simon Peter saith to him Lord not only my feet but also my
hands and my head

1310 Jesus saith to him He that is washed needeth not but to wash
his feet but is clean wholly And you are clean but not all

1311 For he knew who he was that would betray him therefore he said
You are not all clean

1312 Then after he had washed their feet and taken his garments
being set down again he said to them Know you what I have done to
you

1313 You call me Master and Lord And you say well for so I am

1314 If then I being your Lord and Master have washed your feet you
also ought to wash one anothers feet

1315 For I have given you an example that as I have done to you so
you do also

1316 Amen amen I say to you The servant is not greater than his
lord neither is the apostle greater than he that sent him

1317 If you know these things you shall be blessed if you do them

1318 I speak not of you all I know whom I have chosen But that the
scripture may be fulfilled He that eateth bread with me shall lift up
his heel against me

1319 At present I tell you before it come to pass that when it
shall come to pass you may believe that I am he

1320 Amen amen I say to you he that receiveth whomsoever I send
receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me

1321 When Jesus had said these things he was troubled in spirit and
he testified and said Amen amen I say to you one of you shall
betray me

1322 The disciples therefore looked one upon another doubting of
whom he spoke

1323 Now there was leaning on Jesus bosom one of his disciples whom
Jesus loved

1324 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him and said to him Who is it
of whom he speaketh

1325 He therefore leaning on the breast of Jesus saith to him
Lord who is it

1326 Jesus answered He it is to whom I shall reach bread dipped And
when he had dipped the bread he gave it to Judas Iscariot the son of
Simon

1327 And after the morsel Satan entered into him And Jesus said to
him That which thou dost do quickly

That which thou dost do quickly  It is not a license much less a
command to go about his treason but a signification to him that
Christ would not hinder or resist what he was about do it as soon as
he pleased but was both ready and desirous to suffer for our
redemption

1328 Now no man at the table knew to what purpose he said this unto
him

1329 For some thought because Judas had the purse that Jesus had
said to him Buy those things which we have need of for the festival
day or that he should give something to the poor

1330 He therefore having received the morsel went out immediately
And it was night

1331 When he therefore was gone out Jesus said Now is the Son of
man glorified and God is glorified in him

1332 If God be glorified in him God also will glorify him in
himself and immediately will he glorify him

1333 Little children yet a little while I am with you You shall
seek me And as I said to the Jews Whither I go you cannot come so I
say to you now

1334 A new commandment I give unto you That you love one another as
I have loved you that you also love one another

1335 By this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you
have love one for another

1336 Simon Peter saith to him Lord whither goest thou Jesus
answered Whither I go thou canst not follow me now but thou shalt
follow hereafter

1337 Peter saith to him Why cannot I follow thee now I will lay
down my life for thee

1338 Jesus answered him Wilt thou lay down thy life for me Amen
amen I say to thee the cock shall not crow till thou deny me thrice



John Chapter 14


Christs discourse after his last supper

141 Let not your heart be troubled You believe in God believe also
in me

142 In my Fathers house there are many mansions If not I would
have told you because I go to prepare a place for you

143 And if I shall go and prepare a place for you I will come again
and will take you to myself that where I am you also may be

144 And whither I go you know and the way you know

145 Thomas saith to him Lord we know not whither thou goest And
how can we know the way

146 Jesus saith to him I am the way and the truth and the life No
man cometh to the Father but by me

147 If you had known me you would without doubt have known my Father
also and from henceforth you shall know him And you have seen him

148 Philip saith to him Lord shew us the Father and it is enough
for us

149 Jesus saith to him Have I been so long a time with you and have
you not known me Philip he that seeth me seeth the Father also How
sayest thou Shew us the Father

1410 Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me
The words that I speak to you I speak not of myself But the Father
who abideth in me he doth the works

1411 Believe you not that I am in the Father and the Father in me

1412 Otherwise believe for the very works sake Amen amen I say to
you he that believeth in me the works that I do he also shall do
and greater than these shall he do

1413 Because I go to the Father and whatsoever you shall ask the
Father in my name that will I do that the Father may be glorified in
the Son

1414 If you shall ask me any thing in my name that I will do

1415 If you love me keep my commandments

1416 And I will ask the Father and he shall give you another
Paraclete that he may abide with you for ever

Paraclete  That is a comforter or also an advocate inasmuch as by
inspiring prayer he prays as it were in us and pleads for us For
ever  Hence it is evident that this Spirit of Truth was not only
promised to the persons of the apostles but also to their successors
through all generations

1417 The spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it
seeth him not nor knoweth him But you shall know him because he
shall abide with you and shall be in you

1418 I will not leave you orphans I will come to you

1419 Yet a little while and the world seeth me no more But you see
me because I live and you shall live

1420 In that day you shall know that I am in my Father and you in
me and I in you

1421 He that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that
loveth me And he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father and I
will love him and will manifest myself to him

1422 Judas saith to him not the Iscariot Lord how is it that thou
wilt manifest thyself to us and not to the world

1423 Jesus answered and said to him If any one love me he will keep
my word And my Father will love him and we will come to him and will
make our abode with him

1424 He that loveth me not keepeth not my words And the word which
you have heard is not mine but the Fathers who sent me

1425 These things have I spoken to you abiding with you

1426 But the Paraclete the Holy Ghost whom the Father will send in
my name he will teach you all things and bring all things to your
mind whatsoever I shall have said to you

Teach you all things  Here the Holy Ghost is promised to the apostles
and their successors particularly in order to teach them all truth
and to preserve them from error

1427 Peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the
world giveth do I give unto you Let not your heart be troubled nor
let it be afraid

1428 You have heard that I said to you I go away and I come unto
you If you loved me you would indeed be glad because I go to the
Father for the Father is greater than I

For the Father is greater than I  It is evident that Christ our Lord
speaks here of himself as he is made man for as God he is equal to the
Father See Phil 2 Any difficulty of understanding the meaning of
these words will vanish when the relative circumstances of the text
here are considered for Christ being at this time shortly to suffer
death signified to his apostles his human nature by these very words
for as God he could not die And therefore as he was both God and man
it must follow that according to his humanity he was to die which the
apostles were soon to see and believe as he expresses ver 29 And
now I have told you before it come to pass that when it shall come to
pass you may believe

1429 And now I have told you before it come to pass that when it
shall come to pass you may believe

1430 I will not now speak many things with you For the prince of
this world cometh and in me he hath not any thing

1431 But that the world may know that I love the Father and as the
Father hath given me commandments so do I Arise let us go hence



John Chapter 15


A continuation of Christs discourse to his disciples

151 I am the true vine and my Father is the husbandman

152 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he will take away and
every one that beareth fruit he will purge it that it may bring forth
more fruit

153 Now you are clean by reason of the word which I have spoken to
you

154 Abide in me and I in you As the branch cannot bear fruit of
itself unless it abide in the vine so neither can you unless you
abide in me

155 I am the vine you the branches He that abideth in me and I in
him the same beareth much fruit for without me you can do nothing

156 If any one abide not in me he shall be cast forth as a branch
and shall wither and they shall gather him up and cast him into the
fire and he burneth

157 If you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask
whatever you will and it shall be done unto you

158 In this is my Father glorified that you bring forth very much
fruit and become my disciples

159 As the Father hath loved me I also have loved you Abide in my
love

1510 If you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love as I
also have kept my Fathers commandments and do abide in his love

1511 These things I have spoken to you that my joy may be in you
and your joy may be filled

1512 This is my commandment that you love one another as I have
loved you

1513 Greater love than this no man hath that a man lay down his life
for his friends

1514 You are my friends if you do the things that I command you

1515 I will not now call you servants for the servant knoweth not
what his lord doth But I have called you friends because all things
whatsoever I have heard of my Father I have made known to you

1516 You have not chosen me but I have chosen you and have
appointed you that you should go and should bring forth fruit and
your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the Father
in my name he may give it you

1517 These things I command you that you love one another

1518 If the world hate you know ye that it hath hated me before you

1519 If you had been of the world the world would love its own but
because you are not of the world but I have chosen you out of the
world therefore the world hateth you

1520 Remember my word that I said to you The servant is not greater
than his master If they have persecuted me they will also persecute
you If they have kept my word they will keep yours also

1521 But all these things they will do to you for my names sake
because they know not him that sent me

1522 If I had not come and spoken to them they would not have sin
but now they have no excuse for their sin

1523 He that hateth me hateth my Father also

1524 If I had not done among them the works that no other man hath
done they would not have sin but now they have both seen and hated
both me and my Father

1525 But that the word may be fulfilled which is written in their
law they hated me without cause

1526 But when the Paraclete cometh whom I will send you from the
Father the Spirit of truth who proceedeth from the Father he shall
give testimony of me

Whom I will send  This proves against the modern Greeks that the
Holy Ghost proceedeth from the Son as well as from the Father
otherwise he could not be sent by the Son

1527 And you shall give testimony because you are with me from the
beginning



John Chapter 16


The conclusion of Christs last discourse to his disciples

161 These things have I spoken to you things have I spoken to you
that you may not be scandalized

162 They will put you out of the synagogues yea the hour cometh
that whosoever killeth you will think that he doth a service to God

163 And these things will they do to you because they have not known
the Father nor me

164 But these things I have told you that when the hour shall come
you may remember that I told you of them

165 But I told you not these things from the beginning because I was
with you And now I go to him that sent me and none of you asketh me
Whither goest thou

166 But because I have spoken these things to you sorrow hath filled
your heart

167 But I tell you the truth it is expedient to you that I go For
if I go not the Paraclete will not come to you but if I go I will
send him to you

168 And when he is come he will convince the world of sin and of
justice and of judgment

He will convince the world of sin etc  The Holy Ghost by his coming
brought over many thousands first to a sense of their sin in not
believing in Christ Secondly to a conviction of the justice of
Christ now sitting at the right hand of his Father And thirdly to a
right apprehension of the judgment prepared for them that choose to
follow Satan who is already judged and condemned

169 Of sin because they believed not in me

1610 And of justice because I go to the Father and you shall see me
no longer

1611 And of judgment because the prince of this world is already
judged

1612 I have yet many things to say to you but you cannot bear them
now

1613 But when he the Spirit of truth is come he will teach you all
truth For he shall not speak of himself but what things soever he
shall hear he shall speak And the things that are to come he shall
shew you

Will teach you all truth  See the annotation on chap 14 ver 26

1614 He shall glorify me because he shall receive of mine and shall
shew it to you

1615 All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine Therefore I said
that he shall receive of me and shew it to you

1616 A little while and now you shall not see me and again a little
while and you shall see me because I go to the Father

1617 Then some of his disciples said one to another What is this
that he saith to us A little while and you shall not see me and
again a little while and you shall see me and Because I go to the
Father

1618 They said therefore What is this that he saith A little while
We know not what he speaketh

1619 And Jesus knew that they had a mind to ask him And he said to
them Of this do you inquire among yourselves because I said A little
while and you shall not see me and again a little while and you
shall see me

1620 Amen amen I say to you that you shall lament and weep but
the world shall rejoice and you shall be made sorrowful but your
sorrow shall be turned into joy

1621 A woman when she is in labour hath sorrow because her hour is
come but when she hath brought forth the child she remembereth no
more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world

1622 So also you now indeed have sorrow but I will see you again and
your heart shall rejoice And your joy no man shall take from you

1623 And in that day you shall not ask me any thing Amen amen I
say to you if you ask the Father any thing in my name he will give it
you

1624 Hitherto you have not asked any thing in my name Ask and you
shall receive that your joy may be full

1625 These things I have spoken to you in proverbs The hour cometh
when I will no longer speak to you in proverbs but will shew you
plainly of the Father

1626 In that day you shall ask in my name and I say not to you that
I will ask the Father for you

1627 For the Father himself loveth you because you have loved me and
have believed that I came out from God

1628 I came forth from the Father and am come into the world again I
leave the world and I go to the Father

1629 His disciples say to him Behold now thou speakest plainly and
speakest no proverb

1630 Now we know that thou knowest all things and thou needest not
that any man should ask thee By this we believe that thou camest forth
from God

1631 Jesus answered them Do you now believe

1632 Behold the hour cometh and it is now come that you shall be
scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone And yet I am
not alone because the Father is with me

1633 These things I have spoken to you that in me you may have
peace In the world you shall have distress But have confidence I
have overcome the world



John Chapter 17


Christs prayer for his disciples

171 These things Jesus spoke and lifting up his eyes to heaven he
said the hour is come Glorify thy Son that thy Son may glorify thee

172 As thou hast given him power over all flesh that he may give
eternal life to all whom thou hast given him

173 Now this is eternal life That they may know thee the only true
God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent

174 I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work
which thou gavest me to do

175 And now glorify thou me O Father with thyself with the glory
which I had before the world was with thee

176 I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou hast given me out
of the world Thine they were and to me thou gavest them And they
have kept thy word

177 Now they have known that all things which thou hast given me are
from thee

178 Because the words which thou gavest me I have given to them And
they have received them and have known in very deed that I came out
from thee and they have believed that thou didst send me

179 I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them whom thou
hast given me because they are thine

1710 And all my things are thine and thine are mine and I am
glorified in them

1711 And now I am not in the world and these are in the world and I
come to thee Holy Father keep them in thy name whom thou hast given
me that they may be one as we also are

1712 While I was with them I kept them in thy name Those whom thou
gavest me have I kept and none of them is lost but the son of
perdition that the scripture may be fulfilled

1713 And now I come to thee and these things I speak in the world
that they may have my joy filled in themselves

1714 I have given them thy word and the world hath hated them
because they are not of the world as I also am not of the world

1715 I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world but
that thou shouldst keep them from evil

1716 They are not of the world as I also am not of the world

1717 Sanctify them in truth Thy word is truth

1718 As thou hast sent me into the world I also have sent them into
the world

1719 And for them do I sanctify myself that they also may be
sanctified in truth

1720 And not for them only do I pray but for them also who through
their word shall believe in me

1721 That they all may be one as thou Father in me and I in thee
that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou
hast sent me

1722 And the glory which thou hast given me I have given to them
that they may be one as we also are one

1723 I in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one
and the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them as
thou hast also loved me

1724 Father I will that where I am they also whom thou hast given
me may be with me that they may see my glory which thou hast given me
because thou hast loved me before the creation of the world

1725 Just Father the world hath not known thee but I have known
thee And these have known that thou hast sent me

1726 And I have made known thy name to them and will make it known
that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and I in
them



John Chapter 18


The history of the passion of Christ

181 When Jesus had said these things he went forth with his
disciples over the brook Cedron where there was a garden into which
he entered with his disciples

182 And Judas also who betrayed him knew the place because Jesus
had often resorted thither together with his disciples

183 Judas therefore having received a band of soldiers and servants
from the chief priests and the Pharisees cometh thither with lanterns
and torches and weapons

184 Jesus therefore knowing all things that should come upon him
went forth and said to them Whom seek ye

185 They answered him Jesus of Nazareth Jesus saith to them I am
he And Judas also who betrayed him stood with them

186 As soon therefore as he had said to them I am he they went
backward and fell to the ground

187 Again therefore he asked them Whom seek ye And they said
Jesus of Nazareth

188 Jesus answered I have told you that I am he If therefore you
seek me let these go their way

189 That the word might be fulfilled which he said Of them whom thou
hast given me I have not lost any one

1810 Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it and struck the servant
of the high priest and cut off his right ear And the name of thee
servant was Malchus

1811 Jesus therefore said to Peter Put up thy sword into the
scabbard The chalice which my father hath given me shall I not drink
it

1812 Then the band and the tribune and the servants of the Jews took
Jesus and bound him

1813 And they led him away to Annas first for he was fatherinlaw
to Caiphas who was the high priest of that year

1814 Now Caiphas was he who had given the counsel to the Jews That
it was expedient that one man should die for the people

1815 And Simon Peter followed Jesus and so did another disciple And
that disciple was known to the high priest and went in with Jesus into
the court of the high priest

1816 But Peter stood at the door without The other disciple
therefore who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the
portress and brought in Peter

1817 The maid therefore that was portress saith to Peter Art not
thou also one of this mans disciple He saith I am not

1818 Now the servants and ministers stood at a fire of coals because
it was cold and warmed themselves And with them was Peter also
standing and warming himself

1819 The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples and of
his doctrine

1820 Jesus answered him I have spoken openly to the world I have
always taught in the synagogue and in the temple whither all the Jews
resort and in secret I have spoken nothing

1821 Why askest thou me Ask them who have heard what I have spoken
unto them Behold they know what things I have said

1822 And when he had said these things one of the servants standing
by gave Jesus a blow saying Answerest thou the high priest so

1823 Jesus answered him If I have spoken evil give testimony of the
evil but if well why strikest thou me

1824 And Annas sent him bound to Caiphas the high priest

1825 And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself They said
therefore to him Art not thou also one of his disciples He denied it
and said I am not

1826 One of the servants of the high priest a kinsman to him whose
ear Peter cut off saith to him Did not I see thee in the garden with
him

1827 Again therefore Peter denied and immediately the cock crew

1828 Then they led Jesus from Caiphas to the governors hall And it
was morning and they went not into the hall that they might not be
defiled but that they might eat the pasch

1829 Pilate therefore went out to them and said What accusation
bring you against this man

1830 They answered and said to him If he were not a malefactor we
would not have delivered him up to thee

1831 Pilate therefore said to them Take him you and judge him
according to your law The Jews therefore said to him It is not lawful
for us to put any man to death

1832 That the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which he said
signifying what death he should die

1833 Pilate therefore went into the hall again and called Jesus and
said to him Art thou the king of the Jews

1834 Jesus answered Sayest thou this thing of thyself or have
others told it thee of me

1835 Pilate answered Am I a Jew Thy own nation and the chief
priests have delivered thee up to me What hast thou done

1836 Jesus answered My kingdom is not of this world If my kingdom
were of this world my servants would certainly strive that I should
not be delivered to the Jews but now my kingdom is not from hence

1837 Pilate therefore said to him Art thou a king then Jesus
answered Thou sayest that I am a king For this was I born and for
this came I into the world that I should give testimony to the truth
Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice

1838 Pilate saith to him What is truth And when he said this he
went out again to the Jews and saith to them I find no cause in him

1839 But you have a custom that I should release one unto you at the
Pasch Will you therefore that I release unto you the king of the
Jews

1840 Then cried they all again saying Not this man but Barabbas
Now Barabbas was a robber



John Chapter 19


The continuation of the history of the Passion of Christ

191 Then therefore Pilate took Jesus and scourged him

192 And the soldiers platting a crown of thorns put it upon his
head and they put on him a purple garment

193 And they came to him and said Hail king of the Jews And they
gave him blows

194 Pilate therefore went forth again and saith to them Behold I
bring him forth unto you that you may know that I find no cause in
him

195 Jesus therefore came forth bearing the crown of thorns and the
purple garment And he saith to them Behold the Man

196 When the chief priests therefore and the servants had seen him
they cried out saying Crucify him Crucify him Pilate saith to them
Take him you and crucify him for I find no cause in him

197 The Jews answered him We have a law and according to the law he
ought to die because he made himself the Son of God

198 When Pilate therefore had heard this saying he feared the more

199 And he entered into the hall again and he said to Jesus Whence
art thou But Jesus gave him no answer

1910 Pilate therefore saith to him Speakest thou not to me Knowest
thou not that I have power to crucify thee and I have power to release
thee

1911 Jesus answered Thou shouldst not have any power against me
unless it were given thee from above Therefore he that hath delivered
me to thee hath the greater sin

1912 And from henceforth Pilate sought to release him But the Jews
cried out saying If thou release this man thou art not Caesars
friend For whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar

1913 Now when Pilate had heard these words he brought Jesus forth
and sat down in the judgment seat in the place that is called
Lithostrotos and in Hebrew Gabbatha

1914 And it was the parasceve of the pasch about the sixth hour and
he saith to the Jews Behold your king

The parasceve of the pasch  That is the day before the paschal
sabbath The eve of every sabbath was called the parasceve or day of
preparation But this was the eve of a high sabbath viz that which
fell in the paschal week

1915 But they cried out Away with him Away with him Crucify him
Pilate saith to them shall I crucify your king The chief priests
answered We have no king but Caesar

1916 Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified And
they took Jesus and led him forth

1917 And bearing his own cross he went forth to the place which is
called Calvary but in Hebrew Golgotha

1918 Where they crucified him and with him two others one on each
side and Jesus in the midst

1919 And Pilate wrote a title also and he put it upon the cross And
the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS

1920 This title therefore many of the Jews did read because the
place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city And it was
written in Hebrew in Greek and in Latin

1921 Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate Write not
The King of the Jews But that he said I am the King of the Jews

1922 Pilate answered What I have written I have written

1923 The soldiers therefore when they had crucified him took his
garments and they made four parts to every soldier a part and also
his coat Now the coat was without seam woven from the top throughout

1924 They said then one to another Let us not cut it but let us cast
lots for it whose it shall be that the scripture might be fulfilled
saying They have parted my garments among them and upon my vesture
they have cast lots And the soldiers indeed did these things

1925 Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother and his
mothers sister Mary of Cleophas and Mary Magdalen

1926 When Jesus therefore had seen his mother and the disciple
standing whom he loved he saith to his mother Woman behold thy son

1927 After that he saith to the disciple Behold thy mother And
from that hour the disciple took her to his own

1928 Afterwards Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished
that the scripture might be fulfilled said I thirst

1929 Now there was a vessel set there full of vinegar And they
putting a sponge full of vinegar about hyssop put it to his mouth

1930 Jesus therefore when he had taken the vinegar said It is
consummated And bowing his head he gave up the ghost

1931 Then the Jews because it was the parasceve that the bodies
might not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day for that was a
great sabbath day besought Pilate that their legs might be broken
and that they might be taken away

1932 The soldiers therefore came and they broke the legs of the
first and of the other that was crucified with him

1933 But after they were come to Jesus when they saw that he was
already dead they did not break his legs

1934 But one of the soldiers with a spear opened his side and
immediately there came out blood and water

1935 And he that saw it hath given testimony and his testimony is
true And he knoweth that he saith true that you also may believe

1936 For these things were done that the scripture might be
fulfilled You shall not break a bone of him

1937 And again another scripture saith They shall look on him whom
they pierced

1938 And after these things Joseph of Arimathea because he was a
disciple of Jesus but secretly for fear of the Jews besought Pilate
that he might take away the body of Jesus And Pilate gave leave He
came therefore and took away the body of Jesus

1939 And Nicodemus also came he who at the first came to Jesus by
night bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundred pound
weight

1940 They took therefore the body of Jesus and bound it in linen
cloths with the spices as the manner of the Jews is to bury

1941 Now there was in the place where he was crucified a garden and
in the garden a new sepulchre wherein no man yet had been laid

1942 There therefore because of the parasceve of the Jews they
laid Jesus because the sepulchre was nigh at hand



John Chapter 20


Christs resurrection and manifestation to his disciples

201 And on the first day of the week Mary Magdalen cometh early
when it was yet dark unto the sepulchre and she saw the stone taken
away from the sepulchre

202 She ran therefore and cometh to Simon Peter and to the other
disciple whom Jesus loved and saith to them They have taken away the
Lord out of the sepulchre and we know not where they have laid him

203 Peter therefore went out and the other disciple and they came
to the sepulchre

204 And they both ran together and that other disciple did outrun
Peter and came first to the sepulchre

205 And when he stooped down he saw the linen cloths lying but yet
he went not in

206 Then cometh Simon Peter following him and went into the
sepulchre and saw the linen cloths lying

207 And the napkin that had been about his head not lying with the
linen cloths but apart wrapped up into one place

208 Then that other disciple also went in who came first to the
sepulchre and he saw and believed

209 For as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again
from the dead

2010 The disciples therefore departed again to their home

2011 But Mary stood at the sepulchre without weeping Now as she was
weeping she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre

2012 And she saw two angels in white sitting one at the head and
one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been laid

2013 They say to her Woman why weepest thou She saith to them
Because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have
laid him

2014 When she had thus said she turned herself back and saw Jesus
standing and she knew not that it was Jesus

2015 Jesus saith to her Woman why weepest thou Whom seekest thou
She thinking that it was the gardener saith to him Sir if thou hast
taken him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and I will take him
away

2016 Jesus saith to her Mary She turning saith to him Rabboni
which is to say Master

2017 Jesus saith to her Do not touch me for I am not yet ascended
to my Father But go to my brethren and say to them I ascend to my
Father and to your Father to my God and to your God

2018 Mary Magdalen cometh and telleth the disciples I have seen the
Lord and these things he said to me

2019 Now when it was late the same day the first of the week and
the doors were shut where the disciples were gathered together for
fear of the Jews Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them
Peace be to you

The doors were shut  The same power which could bring Christs whole
body entire in all its dimensions through the doors can without the
least question make the same body really present in the sacrament
though both the one and the other be above our comprehension

2020 And when he had said this he shewed them his hands and his
side The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord

2021 He said therefore to them again Peace be to you As the Father
hath sent me I also send you

2022 When he had said this he breathed on them and he said to them
Receive ye the Holy Ghost

2023 Whose sins you shall forgive they are forgiven them and whose
sins you shall retain they are retained

Whose sins etc  See here the commission stamped by the broad seal
of heaven by virtue of which the pastors of Christs church absolve
repenting sinners upon their confession

2024 Now Thomas one of the twelve who is called Didymus was not
with them when Jesus came

2025 The other disciples therefore said to him We have seen the
Lord But he said to them Except I shall see in his hands the print of
the nails and put my finger into the place of the nails and put my hand
into his side I will not believe

2026 And after eight days again his disciples were within and
Thomas with them Jesus cometh the doors being shut and stood in the
midst and said Peace be to you

2027 Then he said to Thomas Put in thy finger hither and see my
hands And bring hither the hand and put it into my side And be not
faithless but believing

2028 Thomas answered and said to him My Lord and my God

2029 Jesus saith to him Because thou hast seen me Thomas thou hast
believed blessed are they that have not seen and have believed

2030 Many other signs also did Jesus in the sight of his disciples
which are not written in this book

2031 But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the
Christ the Son of God and that believing you may have life in his
name



John Chapter 21


Christ manifests himself to his disciples by the sea side and gives
Peter the charge of his sheep

211 After this Jesus shewed himself to the disciples at the sea of
Tiberias And he shewed himself after this manner

212 There were together Simon Peter and Thomas who is called
Didymus and Nathanael who was of Cana of Galilee and the sons of
Zebedee and two others of his disciples

213 Simon Peter saith to them I go a fishing They say to him We
also come with thee And they went forth and entered into the ship and
that night they caught nothing

214 But when the morning was come Jesus stood on the shore yet the
disciples knew not that it was Jesus

215 Jesus therefore said to them Children have you any meat They
answered him No

216 He saith to them Cast the net on the right side of the ship and
you shall find They cast therefore and now they were not able to draw
it for the multitude of fishes

217 That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter It is the
Lord Simon Peter when he heard that it was the Lord girt his coat
about him for he was naked and cast himself into the sea

218 But the other disciples came in the ship for they were not far
from the land but as it were two hundred cubits dragging the net with
fishes

219 As soon then as they came to land they saw hot coals lying and a
fish laid thereon and bread

2110 Jesus saith to them Bring hither of the fishes which you have
now caught

2111 Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land full of great
fishes one hundred and fiftythree And although there were so many
the net was not broken

2112 Jesus saith to them Come and dine And none of them who were at
meat durst ask him Who art thou Knowing that it was the Lord

2113 And Jesus cometh and taketh bread and giveth them and fish in
like manner

2114 This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to his
disciples after he was risen from the dead

2115 When therefore they had dined Jesus saith to Simon Peter
Simon son of John lovest thou me more than these He saith to him
Yea Lord thou knowest that I love thee He saith to him Feed my
lambs

2116 He saith to him again Simon son of John lovest thou me He
saith to him yea Lord thou knowest that I love thee He saith to
him Feed my lambs

2117 He said to him the third time Simon son of John lovest thou
me Peter was grieved because he had said to him the third time Lovest
thou me And he said to him Lord thou knowest all things thou
knowest that I love thee He said to him Feed my sheep

Feed my sheep  Our Lord had promised the spiritual supremacy to St
Peter St Matt 16 19 and here he fulfils that promise by charging
him with the superintendency of all his sheep without exception and
consequently of his whole flock that is of his own church

2118 Amen amen I say to thee When thou wast younger thou didst
gird thyself and didst walk where thou wouldst But when thou shalt be
old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee
and lead thee whither thou wouldst not

2119 And this he said signifying by what death he should glorify
God And when he had said this he saith to him Follow me

2120 Peter turning about saw that disciple whom Jesus loved
following who also leaned on his breast at supper and said Lord who
is he that shall betray thee

2121 Him therefore when Peter had seen he saith to Jesus Lord and
what shall this man do

2122 Jesus saith to him So I will have him to remain till I come
what is it to thee Follow thou me

2123 This saying therefore went abroad among the brethren that that
disciple should not die And Jesus did not say to him He should not
die but So I will have him to remain till I come what is it to thee

2124 This is that disciple who giveth testimony of these things and
hath written these things and we know that his testimony is true

2125 But there are also many other things which Jesus did which if
they were written every one the world itself I think would not be
able to contain the books that should be written




THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES



This Book which from the first ages hath been called THE ACTS OF
THE APOSTLES is not to be considered as a history of what was done by
all the Apostles who were dispersed into different nations but only a
short view of the first establishment of the Christian Church A part
of the preaching and action of St Peter are related in the first
twelve chapters and a particular account of St Pauls apostolical
labours in the subsequent chapters It was written by St Luke the
Evangelist and the original in Greek Its history commences from the
Ascension of Christ our Lord and ends in the year sixtythree being a
brief account of the Church for the space of about thirty years



Acts Chapter 1


The ascension of Christ Matthias is chosen in place of Judas

11 The former treatise I made O Theophilus of all things which
Jesus began to do and to teach

12 Until the day on which giving commandments by the Holy Ghost to
the apostles whom he had chosen he was taken up

13 To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many
proofs for forty days appearing to them and speaking of the kingdom
of God

14 And eating together with them he commanded them that they should
not depart from Jerusalem but should wait for the promise of the
Father which you have heard saith he by my mouth

15 For John indeed baptized with water but you shall be baptized
with the Holy Ghost not many days hence

16 They therefore who were come together asked him saying Lord
wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom of Israel

17 But he said to them It is not for you to know the time or
moments which the Father hath put in his own power

18 But you shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost coming upon you
and you shall be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem and in all Judea and
Samaria and even to the uttermost part of the earth

19 And when he had said these things while they looked on he was
raised up and a cloud received him out of their sight

110 And while they were beholding him going up to heaven behold two
men stood by them in white garments

111 Who also said Ye men of Galilee why stand you looking up to
heaven This Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven shall so come
as you have seen him going into heaven

112 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount that is called
Olivet which is nigh Jerusalem within a sabbath days journey

113 And when they were come in they went up into an upper room
where abode Peter and John James and Andrew Philip and Thomas
Bartholomew and Matthew James of Alpheus and Simon Zelotes and Jude
the brother of James

114 All these were persevering with one mind in prayer with the
women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brethren

115 In those days Peter rising up in the midst of the brethren said
now the number of persons together was about an hundred and twenty

116 Men brethren the scripture must needs be fulfilled which the
Holy Ghost spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas who was
the leader of them that apprehended Jesus

117 Who was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry

118 And he indeed hath possessed a field of the reward of iniquity
and being hanged burst asunder in the midst and all his bowels gushed
out

119 And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem so that
the same field was called in their tongue Haceldama that is to say
The field of blood

120 For it is written in the book of Psalms Let their habitation
become desolate and let there be none to dwell therein And his
bishopric let another take

121 Wherefore of these men who have companied with us all the time
that the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us

122 Beginning from the baptism of John until the day wherein he was
taken up from us one of these must be made a witness with us of his
resurrection

123 And they appointed two Joseph called Barsabas who was surnamed
Justus and Matthias

124 And praying they said Thou Lord who knowest the heart of all
men shew whether of these two thou hast chosen

125 To take the place of this ministry and apostleship from which
Judas hath by transgression fallen that he might go to his own place

126 And they gave them lot and the lot fell upon Matthias and he
was numbered with the eleven apostles



Acts Chapter 2


The disciples receive the Holy Ghost Peters sermon to the people The
piety of the first converts

21 And when the days of the Pentecost were accomplished they were
all together in one place

22 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a mighty wind
coming and it filled the whole house where they were sitting

23 And there appeared to them parted tongues as it were of fire and
it sat upon every one of them

24 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they began to
speak with divers tongues according as the Holy Ghost gave them to
speak

25 Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of
every nation under heaven

26 And when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and
were confounded in mind because that every man heard them speak in his
own tongue

27 And they were all amazed and wondered saying Behold are not
all these that speak Galilean

28 And how have we heard every man our own tongue wherein we were
born

29 Parthians and Medes and Elamites and inhabitants of Mesopotamia
Judea and Cappadocia Pontus and Asia

210 Phrygia and Pamphylia Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene
and strangers of Rome

211 Jews also and proselytes Cretes and Arabians we have heard
them speak in our own tongues the wonderful works of God

212 And they were all astonished and wondered saying one to
another What meaneth this

213 But others mocking said These men are full of new wine

214 But Peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and
spoke to them Ye men of Judea and all you that dwell in Jerusalem be
this known to you and with your ears receive my words

215 For these are not drunk as you suppose seeing it is but the
third hour of the day

216 But this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel

217 And it shall come to pass in the last days saith the Lord I
will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your
daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and
your old men shall dream dreams

218 And upon my servants indeed and upon my handmaids will I pour out
in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy

219 And I will shew wonders in the heaven above and signs on the
earth beneath blood and fire and vapour of smoke

220 The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood
before the great and manifest day of the Lord to come

221 And it shalt come to pass that whosoever shall call upon the
name of the Lord shall be saved

222 Ye men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man
approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs which God
did by him in the midst of you as you also know

223 This same being delivered up by the determinate counsel and
foreknowledge of God you by the hands of wicked men have crucified and
slain

By the determinate etc  God delivered up his Son and his Son
delivered up himself for the love of us and for the sake of our
salvation and so Christs being delivered up was holy and was Gods
own determination But they who betrayed and crucified him did
wickedly following therein their own malice and the instigation of the
devil not the will and determination of God who was by no means the
author of their wickedness though he permitted it because he could
and did draw out of it so great a good viz the salvation of man

224 Whom God hath raised up having loosed the sorrows of hell as it
was impossible that he should be holden by it

Having loosed the sorrow etc  Having overcome the grievous pains of
death and all the power of hell

225 For David saith concerning him I foresaw the Lord before my
face because he is at my right hand that I may not be moved

226 For this my heart hath been glad and my tongue hath rejoiced
moreover my flesh also shall rest in hope

227 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell nor suffer thy Holy
One to see corruption

228 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life thou shalt make me
full of joy with thy countenance

229 Ye men brethren let me freely speak to you of the patriarch
David that he died and was buried and his sepulchre is with us to
this present say

230 Whereas therefore he was a prophet and knew that God hath sworn
to him with an oath that of the fruit of his loins one should sit upon
his throne

231 Foreseeing this he spoke of the resurrection of Christ For
neither was he left in hell neither did his flesh see corruption

232 This Jesus hath God raised again whereof all we are witnesses

233 Being exalted therefore by the right hand of God and having
received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he hath poured
forth this which you see and hear

234 For David ascended not into heaven but he himself said The Lord
said to my Lord Sit thou on my right hand

235 Until I make thy enemies thy footstool

236 Therefore let all the house of Israel know most certainly that
God hath made both Lord and Christ this same Jesus whom you have
crucified

237 Now when they had heard these things they had compunction in
their heart and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles What
shall we do men and brethren

238 But Peter said to them Do penance and be baptized every one of
you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins And
you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost

239 For the promise is to you and to your children and to all that
are far off whomsoever the Lord our God shall call

240 And with very many other words did he testify and exhort them
saying Save yourselves from this perverse generation

241 They therefore that received his word were baptized and there
were added in that day about three thousand souls

242 And they were persevering in the doctrine of the apostles and in
the communication of the breaking of bread and in prayers

243 And fear came upon every soul Many wonders also and signs were
done by the apostles in Jerusalem and there was great fervor in all

244 And all they that believed were together and had all things
common

245 Their possessions and goods they sold and divided them to all
according as every one had need

246 And continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking
bread from house to house they took their meat with gladness and
simplicity of heart

247 Praising God and having favour with all the people And the Lord
increased daily together such as should be saved



Acts Chapter 3


The miracle upon the lame man followed by the conversion of many

31 Now Peter and John went up into the temple at the ninth hour of
prayer

32 And a certain man who was lame from his mothers womb was carried
whom they laid every day at the gate of the temple which is called
Beautiful that he might ask alms of them that went into the temple

33 He when he had seen Peter and John about to go into the temple
asked to receive an alms

34 But Peter with John fastening his eyes upon him said Look upon
us

35 But he looked earnestly upon them hoping that he should receive
something of them

36 But Peter said Silver and gold I have none but what I have I
give thee In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth arise and walk

37 And taking him by the right hand he lifted him up and forthwith
his feet and soles received strength

38 And he leaping up stood and walked and went in with them into the
temple walking and leaping and praising God

39 And all the people saw him walking and praising God

310 And they knew him that it was he who sat begging alms at the
Beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and
amazement at that which had happened to him

311 And as he held Peter and John all the people ran to them to the
porch which is called Solomons greatly wondering

312 But Peter seeing made answer to the people Ye men of Israel
why wonder you at this Or why look you upon us as if by our strength
or power we had made this man to walk

313 The God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob the
God of our fathers hath glorified his Son Jesus whom you indeed
delivered up and denied before the face of Pilate when he judged he
should be released

314 But you denied the Holy One and the Just and desired a murderer
to be granted unto you

315 But the author of life you killed whom God hath raised from the
dead of which we are witnesses

316 And in the faith of his name this man whom you have seen and
known hath his name strengthened And the faith which is by him hath
given this perfect soundness in the sight of you all

317 And now brethren I know that you did it through ignorance as
did also your rulers

318 But those things which God before had shewed by the mouth of all
the prophets that his Christ should suffer he hath so fulfilled

319 Be penitent therefore and be converted that your sins may be
blotted out

320 That when the times of refreshment shall come from the presence
of the Lord and he shall send him who hath been preached unto you
Jesus Christ

321 Whom heaven indeed must receive until the times of the
restitution of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of his
holy prophets from the beginning of the world

322 For Moses said A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto
you of your brethren like unto me him you shall hear according to all
things whatsoever he shall speak to you

323 And it shall be that every soul which will not hear that prophet
shall be destroyed from among the people

324 And all the prophets from Samuel and afterwards who have
spoken have told of these days

325 You are the children of the prophets and of the testament which
God made to our fathers saying to Abraham And in thy seed shall all
the kindreds of the earth be blessed

326 To you first God raising up his Son hath sent him to bless
you that every one may convert himself from his wickedness



Acts Chapter 4


Peter and John are apprehended Their constancy The church is
increased

41 And as they were speaking to the people the priests and the
officer of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them

42 Being grieved that they taught the people and preached in Jesus
the resurrection from the dead

43 And they laid hands upon them and put them in hold till the next
day for it was now evening

44 But many of them who had heard the word believed and the number
of the men was made five thousand

45 And it came to pass on the morrow that their princes and ancients
and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem

46 And Annas the high priest and Caiphas and John and Alexander and
as many as were of the kindred of the high priest

47 And setting them in the midst they asked By what power or by
what name have you done this

48 Then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said to them Ye princes
of the people and ancients hear

49 If we this day are examined concerning the good deed done to the
infirm man by what means he hath been made whole

410 Be it known to you all and to all the people of Israel that by
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified whom
God hath raised from the dead even by him this man standeth here
before you whole

411 This is the stone which was rejected by you the builders which
is become the head of the corner

412 Neither is there salvation in any other For there is no other
name under heaven given to men whereby we must be saved

413 Now seeing the constancy of Peter and of John understanding that
they were illiterate and ignorant men they wondered and they knew
them that they had been with Jesus

414 Seeing the man also who had been healed standing with them they
could say nothing against it

415 But they commanded them to go aside out of the council and they
conferred among themselves

416 Saying What shall we do to these men For indeed a miracle hath
been done by them known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem It is
manifest and we cannot deny it

417 But that it may be no farther spread among the people let us
threaten them that they speak no more in this name to any man

418 And calling them they charged them not to speak at all nor
teach in the name of Jesus

419 But Peter and John answering said to them If it be just in the
sight of God to hear you rather than God judge ye

420 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard

421 But they threatening sent them away not finding how they might
punish them because of the people for all men glorified what had been
done in that which had come to pass

422 For the man was above forty years old in whom that miraculous
cure had been wrought

423 And being let go they came to their own company and related all
that the chief priests and ancients had said to them

424 Who having heard it with one accord lifted up their voice to God
and said Lord thou art he that didst make heaven and earth the sea
and all things that are in them

425 Who by the Holy Ghost by the mouth of our father David thy
servant hast said Why did the Gentiles rage and the people meditate
vain things

426 The kings of the earth stood up and the princes assembled
together against the Lord and his Christ

427 For of a truth there assembled together in this city against thy
holy child Jesus whom thou hast anointed Herod and Pontius Pilate
with the Gentiles and the people of Israel

428 To do what thy hand and thy counsel decreed to be done

429 And now Lord behold their threatenings and grant unto thy
servants that with all confidence they may speak thy word

430 By stretching forth thy hand to cures and signs and wonders to
be done by the name of thy holy Son Jesus

431 And when they had prayed the place was moved wherein they were
assembled and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spoke
the word of God with confidence

432 And the multitude of believers had but one heart and one soul
Neither did any one say that aught of the things which he possessed was
his own but all things were common unto them

433 And with great power did the Apostles give testimony of the
resurrection of Jesus Christ our Lord and great grace was in them all

434 For neither was there any one needy among them For as many as
were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the price of the
things they sold

435 And laid it down before the feet of the apostles And
distribution was made to every one according as he had need

436 And Joseph who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas which
is by interpretation The son of consolation a Levite a Cyprian
born

437 Having land sold it and brought the price and laid it at the
feet of the Apostles



Acts Chapter 5


The judgment of God upon Ananias and Saphira The apostles are cast
into prison

51 But a certain man named Ananias with Saphira his wife sold a
piece of land

52 And by fraud kept back part of the price of the land his wife
being privy thereunto and bringing a certain part of it laid it at
the feet of the apostles

53 But Peter said Ananias why hath Satan tempted thy heart that
thou shouldst lie to the Holy Ghost and by fraud keep part of the price
of the land

54 Whilst it remained did it not remain to thee And after it was
sold was it not in thy power Why hast thou conceived this thing in
thy heart Thou hast not lied to men but to God

55 And Ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost
And there came great fear upon all that heard it

56 And the young men rising up removed him and carrying him out
buried him

57 And it was about the space of three hours after when his wife
not knowing what had happened came in

58 And Peter said to her Tell me woman whether you sold the land
for so much And she said Yea for so much

59 And Peter said unto her Why have you agreed together to tempt the
spirit of the Lord Behold the feet of them who have buried thy husband
are at the door and they shall carry thee out

510 Immediately she fell down before his feet and gave up the ghost
And the young men coming in found her dead and carried her out and
buried her by her husband

511 And there came great fear upon the whole church and upon all that
heard these things

512 And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders
wrought among the people And they were all with one accord in
Solomons porch

513 But of the rest no man durst join himself unto them but the
people magnified them

514 And the multitude of men and women who believed in the Lord was
more increased

515 Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets and
laid them on beds and couches that when Peter came his shadow at the
least might overshadow any of them and they might be delivered from
their infirmities

516 And there came also together to Jerusalem a multitude out of the
neighbouring cities bringing sick persons and such as were troubled
with unclean spirits who were all healed

517 Then the high priest rising up and all they that were with him
which is the heresy of the Sadducees were filled with envy

518 And they laid hands on the apostles and put them in the common
prison

519 But an angel of the Lord by night opening the doors of the
prison and leading them out said

520 Go and standing speak in the temple to the people all the words
of this life

521 Who having heard this early in the morning entered into the
temple and taught And the high priest coming and they that were with
him called together the council and all the ancients of the children
of Israel and they sent to the prison to have them brought

522 But when the ministers came and opening the prison found them not
there they returned and told

523 Saying The prison indeed we found shut with all diligence and
the keepers standing before the door but opening it we found no man
within

524 Now when the officer of the temple and the chief priests heard
these words they were in doubt concerning them what would come to
pass

525 But one came and told them Behold the men whom you put in
prison are in the temple standing and teaching the people

526 Then went the officer with the ministers and brought them without
violence for they feared the people lest they should be stoned

527 And when they had brought them they set them before the council
And the high priest asked them

528 Saying Commanding we commanded you that you should not teach in
this name And behold you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine
and you have a mind to bring the blood of this man upon us

529 But Peter and the apostles answering said We ought to obey God
rather than men

530 The God of our fathers hath raised up Jesus whom you put to
death hanging him upon a tree

531 Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be Prince and
Saviour to give repentance to Israel and remission of sins

532 And we are witnesses of these things and the Holy Ghost whom
God hath given to all that obey him

533 When they had heard these things they were cut to the heart and
they thought to put them to death

534 But one in the council rising up a Pharisee named Gamaliel a
doctor of the law respected by all the people commanded the men to be
put forth a little while

535 And he said to them Ye men of Israel take heed to yourselves
what you intend to do as touching these men

536 For before these days rose up Theodas affirming himself to be
somebody to whom a number of men about four hundred joined
themselves Who was slain and all that believed him were scattered and
brought to nothing

537 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the
enrolling and drew away the people after him He also perished and
all even as many as consented to him were dispersed

538 And now therefore I say to you Refrain from these men and let
them alone For if this council or this work be of men it will come to
nought

539 But if it be of God you cannot overthrow it lest perhaps you be
found even to fight against God And they consented to him

540 And calling in the apostles after they had scourged them they
charged them that they should not speak at all in the name of Jesus
And they dismissed them

541 And they indeed went from the presence of the council rejoicing
that they were accounted worthy to suffer reproach for the name of
Jesus

542 And every day they ceased not in the temple and from house to
house to teach and preach Christ Jesus



Acts Chapter 6


The ordination of the seven deacons The zeal of Stephen

61 And in those days the number of the disciples increasing there
arose a murmuring of the Greeks against the Hebrews for that their
widows were neglected in the daily ministration

Greeks  So they called the Jews that were born and brought up in
Greece

62 Then the twelve calling together the multitude of the disciples
said It is not reason that we should leave the word of God and serve
tables

63 Wherefore brethren look ye out among you seven men of good
reputation full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over
this business

64 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the
ministry of the word

65 And the saying was liked by all the multitude And they chose
Stephen a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost and Philip and
Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolas a proselyte
of Antioch

66 These they set before the apostles and they praying imposed
hands upon them

67 And the word of the Lord increased and the number of the
disciples was multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly A great multitude
also of the priests obeyed the faith

68 And Stephen full of grace and fortitude did great wonders and
signs among the people

69 Now there arose some of that which is called the synagogue of the
Libertines and of the Cyrenians and of the Alexandrians and of them
that were of Cilicia and Asia disputing with Stephen

610 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit that
spoke

611 Then they suborned men to say they had heard him speak words of
blasphemy against Moses and against God

612 And they stirred up the people and the ancients and the scribes
And running together they took him and brought him to the council

613 And they set up false witnesses who said This man ceaseth not
to speak words against the holy place and the law

614 For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall
destroy this place and shall change the traditions which Moses
delivered unto us

615 And all that sat in the council looking on him saw his face as
if it had been the face of an angel



Acts Chapter 7


Stephens speech before the council His martyrdom

71 Then the high priest said Are these things so

72 Who said Ye men brethren and fathers hear The God of glory
appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia before he
dwelt in Charan

73 And said to him Go forth out of thy country and from thy kindred
and come into the land which I shall shew thee

74 Then he went out of the land of the Chaldeans and dwelt in Charan
And from thence after his father was dead he removed him into this
land wherein you now dwell

75 And he gave him no inheritance in it no not the pace of a foot
But he promised to give it him in possession and to his seed after
him when as yet he had no child

76 And God said to him That his seed should sojourn in a strange
country and that they should bring them under bondage and treat them
evil four hundred years

77 And the nation which they shall serve will I judge said the
Lord and after these things they shall go out and shall serve me in
this place

78 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision And so he begot
Isaac and circumcised him the eighth day and Isaac begot Jacob and
Jacob the twelve patriarchs

79 And the patriarchs through envy sold Joseph into Egypt And God
was with him

710 And delivered him out of all his tribulations and he gave him
favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharao the king of Egypt And he
appointed him governor over Egypt and over all his house

711 Now there came a famine upon all Egypt and Chanaan and great
tribulation and our fathers found no food

712 But when Jacob had heard that there was corn in Egypt he sent
our fathers first

713 And at the second time Joseph was known by his brethren and his
kindred was made known to Pharao

714 And Joseph sending called thither Jacob his father and all his
kindred seventyfive souls

715 So Jacob went down into Egypt And he died and our fathers

716 And they were translated into Sichem and were laid in the
sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Hemor
the son of Sichem

717 And when the time of the promise drew near which God had
promised to Abraham the people increased and were multiplied in Egypt

718 Till another king arose in Egypt who knew not Joseph

719 This same dealing craftily with our race afflicted our fathers
that they should expose their children to the end they might not be
kept alive

720 At the same time was Moses born and he was acceptable to God
Who was nourished three months in his fathers house

721 And when he was exposed Pharaos daughter took him up and
nourished him for her own son

722 And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and
he was mighty in his words and in his deeds

723 And when he was full forty years old it came into his heart to
visit his brethren the children of Israel

724 And when he had seen one of them suffer wrong he defended him
and striking the Egyptian he avenged him who suffered the injury

725 And he thought that his brethren understood that God by his hand
would save them But they understood it not

726 And the day following he shewed himself to them when they were
at strife and would have reconciled them in peace saying Men ye are
brethren Why hurt you one another

727 But he that did the injury to his neighbour thrust him away
saying Who hath appointed thee prince and judge over us

728 What Wilt thou kill me as thou didst yesterday kill the
Egyptian

729 And Moses fled upon this word and was a stranger in the land of
Madian where he begot two sons

730 And when forty years were expired there appeared to him in the
desert of mount Sina an angel in a flame of fire in a bush

731 And Moses seeing it wondered at the sight And as he drew near to
view it the voice of the Lord came unto him saying

732 I am the God of thy fathers the God of Abraham the God of Isaac
and the God of Jacob And Moses being terrified durst not behold

733 And the Lord said to him Loose the shoes from thy feet for the
place wherein thou standest is holy ground

734 Seeing I have seen the affliction of my people which is in
Egypt and I have heard their groaning and am come down to deliver
them And now come and I will send thee into Egypt

735 This Moses whom they refused saying Who hath appointed thee
prince and judge Him God sent to be prince and redeemer by the hand
of the angel who appeared to him in the burning bush

736 He brought them out doing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt
and in the Red Sea and in the desert forty years

737 This is that Moses who said to the children of Israel A prophet
shall God raise up to you of your own brethren as myself Him shall
you hear

738 This is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the
angel who spoke to him on Mount Sina and with our fathers Who received
the words of life to give unto us

739 Whom our fathers would not obey but thrust him away and in their
hearts turned back into Egypt

740 Saying to Aaron Make us gods to go before us For as for this
Moses who brought us out of the land of Egypt we know not what is
become of him

741 And they made a calf in those days and offered sacrifices to the
idol and rejoiced in the works of their own hands

742 And God turned and gave them up to serve the host of heaven as
it is written in the books of the prophets Did you offer victims and
sacrifices to me for forty years in the desert O house of Israel

743 And you took unto you the tabernacle of Moloch and the star of
your god Rempham figures which you made to adore them And I will
carry you away beyond Babylon

744 The tabernacle of the testimony was with our fathers in the
desert as God ordained for them speaking to Moses that he should
make it according to the form which he had seen

745 Which also our fathers receiving brought in with Jesus into the
possession of the Gentiles whom God drove out before the face of our
fathers unto the days of David

Jesus  That is Josue so called in Greek

746 Who found grace before God and desired to find a tabernacle for
the God of Jacob

747 But Solomon built him a house

748 Yet the most High dwelleth not in houses made by hands as the
prophet saith

Dwelleth not in houses etc  That is so as to stand in need of
earthly dwellings or to be contained or circumscribed by them
Though otherwise by his immense divinity he is in our houses and
every where else and Christ in his humanity dwelt in houses and is
now on our altars

749 Heaven is my throne and the earth my footstool What house will
you build me saith the Lord Or what is the place of my resting

750 Hath not my hand made all these things

751 You stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears you always
resist the Holy Ghost As your fathers did so do you also

752 Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted And they
have slain them who foretold of the coming of the Just One of whom you
have been now the betrayers and murderers

753 Who have received the law by the disposition of angels and have
not kept it

754 Now hearing these things they were cut to the heart and they
gnashed with their teeth at him

755 But he being full of the Holy Ghost looking up steadfastly to
heaven saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of
God And he said Behold I see the heavens opened and the Son of man
standing on the right hand of God

756 And they crying out with a loud voice stopped their ears and
with one accord ran violently upon him

757 And casting him forth without the city they stoned him And the
witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man whose
name was Saul

758 And they stoned Stephen invoking and saying Lord Jesus receive
my spirit

759 And falling on his knees he cried with a loud voice saying
Lord lay not his sin to their charge And when he had said this he
fell asleep in the Lord And Saul was consenting to his death



Acts Chapter 8


Philip converts the Samaritans and baptizes the eunuch

81 And at that time there was raised a great persecution against the
church which was at Jerusalem And they were all dispersed through the
countries of Judea and Samaria except the apostles

82 And devout men took order for Stephens funeral and made great
mourning over him

83 But Saul made havock of the church entering in from house to
house and dragging away men and women committed them to prison

84 They therefore that were dispersed went about preaching the word
of God

85 And Philip going down to the city of Samaria preached Christ
unto them

86 And the people with one accord were attentive to those things
which were said by Philip hearing and seeing the miracles which he
did

87 For many of them who had unclean spirits crying with a loud
voice went out

88 And many taken with the palsy and that were lame were healed

89 There was therefore great joy in that city Now there was a
certain man named Simon who before had been a magician in that city
seducing the people of Samaria giving out that he was some great one

810 To whom they all gave ear from the least to the greatest
saying This man is the power of God which is called great

811 And they were attentive to him because for a long time he had
bewitched them with his magical practices

812 But when they had believed Philip preaching of the kingdom of
God in the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and
women

813 Then Simon himself believed also and being baptized he adhered
to Philip And being astonished wondered to see the signs and
exceeding great miracles which were done

814 Now when the apostles who were in Jerusalem had heard that
Samaria had received the word of God they sent unto them Peter and
John

815 Who when they were come prayed for them that they might receive
the Holy Ghost

816 For he was not as yet come upon any of them but they were only
baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus

817 Then they laid their hands upon them and they received the Holy
Ghost

They laid their hands upon them etc  The apostles administered the
sacrament of confirmation by imposition of hands and prayer and the
faithful thereby received the Holy Ghost Not but they had received the
grace of the Holy Ghost at their baptism yet not that plenitude of
grace and those spiritual gifts which they afterwards received from
bishops in the sacrament of confirmation which strengthened them to
profess their faith publicly

818 And when Simon saw that by the imposition of the hands of the
apostles the Holy Ghost was given he offered them money

819 Saying Give me also this power that on whomsoever I shall lay
my hands he may receive the Holy Ghost But Peter said to him

820 Keep thy money to thyself to perish with thee because thou hast
thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money

821 Thou hast no part nor lot in this matter For thy heart is not
right in the sight of God

822 Do penance therefore for this thy wickedness and pray to God
that perhaps this thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee

823 For I see thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of
iniquity

824 Then Simon answering said Pray you for me to the Lord that none
of these things which you have spoken may come upon me

825 And they indeed having testified and preached the word of the
Lord returned to Jerusalem and preached the gospel to many countries
of the Samaritans

826 Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip saying Arise go
towards the south to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem into Gaza
this is desert

827 And rising up he went And behold a man of Ethiopia an eunuch
of great authority under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians who had
charge over all her treasures had come to Jerusalem to adore

828 And he was returning sitting in his chariot and reading Isaias
the prophet

829 And the Spirit said to Philip Go near and join thyself to this
chariot

830 And Philip running thither heard him reading the prophet Isaias
And he said Thinkest thou that thou understandest what thou readest

831 Who said And how can I unless some man shew me And he desired
Philip that he would come up and sit with him

832 And the place of the scripture which he was reading was this He
was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb without voice
before his shearer so openeth he not his mouth

833 In humility his judgment was taken away His generation who shall
declare for his life shall be taken from the earth

834 And the eunuch answering Philip said I beseech thee of whom
doth the prophet speak this Of himself or of some other man

835 Then Philip opening his mouth and beginning at this scripture
preached unto him Jesus

836 And as they went on their way they came to a certain water And
the eunuch said See here is water What doth hinder me from being
baptized

837 And Philip said If thou believest with all thy heart thou
mayest And he answering said I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son
of God

If thou believest with all thy heart  The scripture many times
mentions only one disposition as here belief when others equally
necessary are not expressed viz a sorrow for sins a firm hope and
the love of God Moreover believing with the whole heart signifies a
belief of every thing necessary for salvation

838 And he commanded the chariot to stand still And they went down
into the water both Philip and the eunuch And he baptized him

839 And when they were come up out of the water the Spirit of the
Lord took away Philip and the eunuch saw him no more And he went on
his way rejoicing

840 But Philip was found in Azotus and passing through he preached
the gospel to all the cities till he came to Caesarea



Acts Chapter 9


Pauls conversion and zeal Peter heals Eneas and raises up Tabitha to
life

91 And Saul as yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against
the disciples of the Lord went to the high priest

92 And asked of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues that if
he found any men and women of this way he might bring them bound to
Jerusalem

93 And as he went on his journey it came to pass that he drew nigh
to Damascus And suddenly a light from heaven shined round about him

94 And falling on the ground he heard a voice saying to him Saul
Saul why persecutest thou me

95 Who said Who art thou Lord And he I am Jesus whom thou
persecutest It is hard for thee to kick against the goad

96 And he trembling and astonished said Lord what wilt thou have
me to do

97 And the Lord said to him Arise and go into the city and there it
shall be told thee what thou must do Now the men who went in company
with him stood amazed hearing indeed a voice but seeing no man

98 And Saul arose from the ground and when his eyes were opened he
saw nothing But they leading him by the hands brought him to
Damascus

99 And he was there three days without sight and he did neither eat
nor drink

910 Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias And
the Lord said to him in a vision Ananias And he said Behold I am
here Lord

911 And the Lord said to him Arise and go into the street that is
called Strait and seek in the house of Judas one named Saul of Tarsus
For behold he prayeth

912 And he saw a man named Ananias coming in and putting his hands
upon him that he might receive his sight

913 But Ananias answered Lord I have heard by many of this man how
much evil he hath done to thy saints in Jerusalem

914 And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all
that invoke thy name

915 And the Lord said to him Go thy way for this man is to me a
vessel of election to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and
the children of Israel

916 For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my names
sake

917 And Ananias went his way and entered into the house And laying
his hands upon him he said Brother Saul the Lord Jesus hath sent me
he that appeared to thee in the way as thou camest that thou mayest
receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost

918 And immediately there fell from his eyes as it were scales and
he received his sight And rising up he was baptized

919 And when he had taken meat he was strengthened And he was with
the disciples that were at Damascus for some days

920 And immediately he preached Jesus in the synagogues that he is
the son of God

921 And all that heard him were astonished and said Is not this he
who persecuted in Jerusalem those that called upon this name and came
hither for that intent that he might carry them bound to the chief
priests

922 But Saul increased much more in strength and confounded the Jews
who dwelt at Damascus affirming that this is the Christ

923 And when many days were passed the Jews consulted together to
kill him

924 But their lying in wait was made known to Saul And they watched
the gates also day and night that they might kill him

925 But the disciples taking him in the night conveyed him away by
the wall letting him down in a basket

926 And when he was come into Jerusalem he essayed to join himself
to the disciples and they all were afraid of him not believing that
he was a disciple

927 But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and told
them how he had seen the Lord and that he had spoken to him and how
in Damascus he had dealt confidently in the name of Jesus

928 And he was with them coming in and going out in Jerusalem and
dealing confidently in the name of the Lord

929 He spoke also to the Gentiles and disputed with the Greeks But
they sought to kill him

930 Which when the brethren had known they brought him down to
Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus

931 Now the church had peace throughout all Judea and Galilee and
Samaria and was edified walking in the fear of the Lord and was
filled with the consolation of the Holy Ghost

932 And it came to pass that Peter as he passed through visiting
all came to the saints who dwelt at Lydda

933 And he found there a certain man named Eneas who had kept his
bed for eight years who was ill of the palsy

934 And Peter said to him Eneas the Lord Jesus Christ healeth thee
Arise and make thy bed And immediately he arose

935 And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him who were converted
to the Lord

936 And in Joppe there was a certain disciple named Tabitha which by
interpretation is called Dorcas This woman was full of good works and
almsdeeds which she did

937 And it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died
Whom when they had washed they laid her in an upper chamber

938 And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppe the disciples hearing
that Peter was there sent unto him two men desiring him that he would
not be slack to come unto them

939 And Peter rising up went with them And when he was come they
brought him into the upper chamber And all the widows stood about him
weeping and shewing him the coats and garments which Dorcas made them

940 And they all being put forth Peter kneeling down prayed And
turning to the body he said Tabitha arise And she opened her eyes
and seeing Peter sat up

941 And giving her his hand he lifted her up And when he had called
the saints and the widows he presented her alive

942 And it was made known throughout all Joppe And many believed in
the Lord

943 And it cane to pass that he abode many days in Joppe with one
Simon a tanner



Acts Chapter 10


Cornelius is received into the church Peters vision

101 And there was a certain man in Caesarea named Cornelius a
centurion of that which is called the Italian band

102 A religious man and fearing God with all his house giving much
alms to the people and always praying to God

103 This man saw in a vision manifestly about the ninth hour of the
day an angel of God coming in unto him and saying to him Cornelius

104 And he beholding him being seized with fear said What is it
Lord And he said to him Thy prayers and thy alms are ascended for a
memorial in the sight of God

105 And now send men to Joppe and call hither one Simon who is
surnamed Peter

106 He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner whose house is by the sea
side He will tell thee what thou must do

107 And when the angel who spoke to him was departed he called two
of his household servants and a soldier who feared the Lord of them
that were under him

108 To whom when he had related all he sent them to Joppe

109 And on the next day whilst they were going on their journey and
drawing nigh to the city Peter went up to the higher parts of the
house to pray about the sixth hour

1010 And being hungry he was desirous to taste somewhat And as they
were preparing there came upon him an ecstasy of mind

1011 And he saw the heaven opened and a certain vessel descending as
it were a great linen sheet let down by the four corners from heaven to
the earth

1012 Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts and creeping
things of the earth and fowls of the air

1013 And there came a voice to him Arise Peter Kill and eat

1014 But Peter said Far be it from me For I never did eat any thing
that is common and unclean

1015 And the voice spoke to him again the second time That which God
hath cleansed do not thou call common

1016 And this was done thrice And presently the vessel was taken up
into heaven

1017 Now whilst Peter was doubting within himself what the vision
that he had seen should mean behold the men who were sent from
Cornelius inquiring for Simons house stood at the gate

1018 And when they had called they asked if Simon who is surnamed
Peter were lodged there

1019 And as Peter was thinking of the vision the Spirit said to him
Behold three men seek thee

1020 Arise therefore get thee down and go with them doubting
nothing for I have sent them

1021 Then Peter going down to the men said Behold I am he whom
you seek What is the cause for which you are come

1022 Who said Cornelius a centurion a just man and one that
feareth God and having good testimony from all the nation of the Jews
received an answer of an holy angel to send for thee into his house
And to hear words of thee

1023 Then bringing them in he lodged them And the day following he
arose and went with them and some of the brethren from Joppe
accompanied him

1024 And the morrow after he entered into Caesarea And Cornelius
waited for them having called together his kinsmen and special
friends

1025 And it came to pass that when Peter was come in Cornelius came
to meet him and falling at his feet adored

1026 But Peter lifted him up saying Arise I myself also am a man

1027 And talking with him he went in and found many that were come
together

1028 And he said to them you know how abominable it is for a man
that is a Jew to keep company or to come unto one of another nation
but God hath shewed to me to call no man common or unclean

1029 For which cause making no doubt I came when I was sent for I
ask therefore for what cause you have sent for me

1030 And Cornelius said Four days ago unto this hour I was praying
in my house at the ninth hour and behold a man stood before me in
white apparel and said

1031 Cornelius thy prayer is heard and thy alms are had in
remembrance in the sight of God

1032 Send therefore to Joppe and call hither Simon who is surnamed
Peter He lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner by the sea side

1033 Immediately therefore I sent to thee and thou hast done well in
coming Now therefore all we are present in thy sight to hear all
things whatsoever are commanded thee by the Lord

1034 And Peter opening his mouth said in very deed I perceive that
God is not a respecter of persons

1035 But in every nation he that feareth him and worketh justice is
acceptable to him

In every nation etc  That is to say not only Jews but Gentiles
also of what nation soever are acceptable to God if they fear him
and work justice But then true faith is always to be presupposed
without which saith St Paul Heb 11 6 it is impossible to please
God Beware then of the error of those who would infer from this
passage that men of all religions may be pleasing to God For since
none but the true religion can be from God all other religions must be
from the father of lies and therefore highly displeasing to the God of
truth

1036 God sent the word to the children of Israel preaching peace by
Jesus Christ He is Lord of all

1037 You know the word which hath been published through all Judea
for it began from Galilee after the baptism which John preached

1038 Jesus of Nazareth how God anointed him with the Holy Ghost and
with power who went about doing good and healing all that were
oppressed by the devil for God was with him

1039 And we are witnesses of all things that he did in the land of
the Jews and in Jerusalem whom they killed hanging him upon a tree

1040 Him God raised up the third day and gave him to be made
manifest

1041 Not to all the people but to witnesses preordained by God even
to us who did eat and drink with him after he arose again from the
dead

1042 And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that
it is he who was appointed by God to be judge of the living and of the
dead

1043 To him all the prophets give testimony that by his name all
receive remission of sins who believe in him

1044 While Peter was yet speaking these words the Holy Ghost fell on
all them that heard the word

1045 And the faithful of the circumcision who came with Peter were
astonished for that the grace of the Holy Ghost was poured out upon the
Gentiles also

1046 For they heard them speaking with tongues and magnifying God

1047 Then Peter answered Can any man forbid water that these should
not be baptized who have received the Holy Ghost as well as we

1048 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord
Jesus Christ Then they desired him to tarry with them some days



Acts Chapter 11


Peter defends his having received the Gentiles into the church

111 And the apostles and brethren who were in Judea heard that the
Gentiles also had received the word of God

112 And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem they that were of the
circumcision contended with him

113 Saying Why didst thou go in to men uncircumcised and didst eat
with them

114 But Peter began and declared to them the matter in order saying

115 I was in the city of Joppe praying and I saw in an ecstasy of
mind a vision a certain vessel descending as it were a great sheet
let down from heaven by four corners And it came even unto me

116 Into which looking I considered and saw fourfooted creatures of
the earth and beasts and creeping things and fowls of the air

117 And I heard also a voice saying to me Arise Peter Kill and
eat

118 And I said Not so Lord for nothing common or unclean hath ever
entered into my mouth

119 And the voice answered again from heaven What God hath made
clean do not thou call common

1110 And this was done three times And all were taken up again into
heaven

1111 And behold immediately there were three men come to the house
wherein I was sent to me from Caesarea

1112 And the Spirit said to me that I should go with them nothing
doubting And these six brethren went with me also and we entered into
the mans house

1113 And he told us how he had seen an angel in his house standing
and saying to him Send to Joppe and call hither Simon who is surnamed
Peter

1114 Who shall speak to thee words whereby thou shalt be saved and
all thy house

1115 And when I had begun to speak the Holy Ghost fell upon them as
upon us also in the beginning

1116 And I remembered the word of the Lord how that he said John
indeed baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy
Ghost

1117 If then God gave them the same grace as to us also who believed
in the Lord Jesus Christ who was I that could withstand God

1118 Having heard these things they held their peace and glorified
God saying God then hath also to the Gentiles given repentance unto
life

1119 Now they who had been dispersed by the persecution that arose on
occasion of Stephen went about as far as Phenice and Cyprus and
Antioch speaking the word to none but to the Jews only

1120 But some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene who when they
were entered into Antioch spoke also to the Greeks preaching the Lord
Jesus

1121 And the hand of he Lord was with them and a great number
believing were converted to the Lord

1122 And the tidings came to the ears of the church that was at
Jerusalem touching these things and they sent Barnabas as far as
Antioch

1123 Who when he was come and had seen the grace of God rejoiced
And he exhorted them all with purpose of heart to continue in the Lord

1124 For he was a good man and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith
And a great multitude was added to the Lord

1125 And Barnabas went to Tarsus to seek Saul whom when he had
found he brought to Antioch

1126 And they conversed there in the church a whole year and they
taught a great multitude so that at Antioch the disciples were first
named Christians

1127 And in these days there came prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch

1128 And one of them named Agabus rising up signified by the Spirit
that there should be a great famine over the whole world which came to
pass under Claudius

1129 And the disciples every man according to his ability purposed
to send relief to the brethren who dwelt in Judea

1130 Which also they did sending it to the ancients by the hands of
Barnabas and Saul



Acts Chapter 12


Herods persecution Peters deliverance by an angel Herods
punishment

121 And at the same time Herod the king stretched forth his hands
to afflict some of the church

122 And he killed James the brother of John With the sword

123 And seeing that it pleased the Jews he proceeded to take up
Peter also Now it was in the days of the Azymes

Azymes  The festival of the unleavened bread or the pasch which
answers to our Easter

124 And when he had apprehended him he cast him into prison
delivering him to four files of soldiers to be kept intending after
the pasch to bring him forth to the people

125 Peter therefore was kept in prison But prayer was made without
ceasing by the church unto God for him

126 And when Herod would have brought him forth the same night
Peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and the
keepers before the door kept the prison

127 And behold an angel of the Lord stood by him and a light shined
in the room And he striking Peter on the side raised him up saying
Arise quickly And the chains fell off from his hands

128 And the angel said to him Gird thyself and put on thy sandals
And he did so And he said to him Cast thy garment about thee and
follow me

129 And going out he followed him And he knew not that it was true
which was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision

1210 And passing through the first and the second ward they came to
the iron gate that leadeth to the city which of itself opened to them
And going out they passed on through one street And immediately the
angel departed from him

1211 And Peter coming to himself said Now I know in very deed that
the Lord hath sent his angel and hath delivered me out of the hand of
Herod and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews

1212 And considering he came to the house of Mary the mother of
John who was surnamed Mark where many were gathered together and
praying

1213 And when he knocked at the door of the gate a damsel came to
hearken whose name was Rhode

1214 And as soon as she knew Peters voice she opened not the gate
for joy but running in she told that Peter stood before the gate

1215 But they said to her Thou art mad But she affirmed that it was
so Then said they It is his angel

1216 But Peter continued knocking And when they had opened they saw
him and were astonished

1217 But he beckoning to them with his hand to hold their peace
told how the Lord had brought him out of prison And he said Tell
these things to James and to the brethren And going out he went into
another place

1218 Now when day was come there was no small stir among the
soldiers what was become of Peter

1219 And when Herod had sought for him and found him not having
examined the keepers he commanded they should be put to death And
going down from Judea to Caesarea he abode there

1220 And he was angry with the Tyrians and the Sidonians But they
with one accord came to him and having gained Blastus who was the
kings chamberlain they desired peace because their countries were
nourished by him

1221 And upon a day appointed Herod being arrayed in kingly apparel
sat in the judgment seat and made an oration to them

1222 And the people made acclamation saying It is the voice of a
god and not of a man

1223 And forthwith an angel of the Lord struck him because he had
not given the honour to God and being eaten up by worms he gave up
the ghost

1224 But the word of the Lord increased and multiplied

1225 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem having fulfilled
their ministry taking with them John who was surnamed Mark



Acts Chapter 13


Saul and Barnabas are sent forth by the Holy Ghost They preach in
Cyprus and in Antioch of Pisidia

131 Now there were in the church which was at Antioch prophets and
doctors among whom was Barnabas and Simon who was called Niger and
Lucius of Cyrene and Manahen who was the foster brother of Herod the
tetrarch and Saul

132 And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting the Holy
Ghost said to them Separate me Saul and Barnabas for the work
whereunto I have taken them

133 Then they fasting and praying and imposing their hands upon them
sent them away

134 So they being sent by the Holy Ghost went to Seleucia and from
thence they sailed to Cyprus

135 And when they were come to Salamina they preached the word of
God in the synagogues of the Jews And they had John also in the
ministry

136 And when they had gone through the whole island as far as
Paphos they found a certain man a magician a false prophet a Jew
whose name was BarJesu

137 Who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus a prudent man He
sending for Barnabas and Saul desired to hear the word of God

138 But Elymas the magician for so his name is interpreted
withstood them seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith

139 Then Saul otherwise Paul filled with the Holy Ghost looking
upon him

1310 Said O full of all guile and of all deceit child of the devil
enemy of all justice thou ceases not to pervert the right ways of the
Lord

1311 And now behold the hand of the Lord is upon thee and thou
shalt be blind not seeing the sun for a time And immediately there
fell a mist and darkness upon him and going about he sought some one
to lead him by the hand

1312 Then the proconsul when he had seen what was done believed
admiring at the doctrine of the Lord

1313 Now when Paul and they that were with him had sailed from
Paphos they came to Perge in Pamphylia And John departing from them
returned to Jerusalem

1314 But they passing through Perge came to Antioch in Pisidia
and entering into the Synagogue on the sabbath day they sat down

1315 And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of
the synagogue sent to them saying Ye men brethren if you have any
word of exhortation to make to the people speak

1316 Then Paul rising up and with his hand bespeaking silence said
Ye men of Israel and you that fear God give ear

1317 The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers and exalted
the people when they were sojourners in the land of Egypt And with an
high arm brought them out from thence

1318 And for the space of forty years endured their manners in the
desert

1319 And destroying seven nations in the land of Chaanan divided
their land among them by lot

1320 As it were after four hundred and fifty years And after these
things he gave unto them judges until Samuel the prophet

1321 And after that they desired a king and God gave them Saul the
son of Cis a man of the tribe of Benjamin forty years

1322 And when he had removed him he raised them up David to be king
to whom giving testimony he said I have found David the son of
Jesse a man according to my own heart who shall do all my wills

1323 Of this mans seed God according to his promise hath raised
up to Israel a Saviour Jesus

1324 John first preaching before his coming the baptism of penance
to all the people of Israel

1325 And when John was fulfilling his course he said I am not he
whom you think me to be But behold there cometh one after me whose
shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose

1326 Men brethren children of the stock of Abraham and whosoever
among you fear God to you the word of this salvation is sent

1327 For they that inhabited Jerusalem and the rulers thereof not
knowing him nor the voices of the prophets which are read every
sabbath judging him have fulfilled them

1328 And finding no cause of death in him they desired of Pilate
that they might kill him

1329 And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him
taking him down from the tree they laid him in a sepulchre

1330 But God raised him up from the dead the third day

1331 Who was seen for many days by them who came up with him from
Galilee to Jerusalem who to this present are his witnesses to the
people

1332 And we declare unto you that the promise which was made to our
fathers

1333 This same God hath fulfilled to our children raising up Jesus
as in the second psalm also is written Thou art my Son this day have
I begotten thee

1334 And to shew that he raised him up from the dead not to return
now any more to corruption he said thus I will give you the holy
things of David faithful

I will give you the holy etc  These are the words of the prophet
Isaias 55 3 According to the Septuagint the sense is I will
faithfully fulfil the promises I made to David

1335 And therefore in another place also he saith Thou shalt not
suffer thy holy one to see corruption

1336 For David when he had served in his generation according to
the will of God slept and was laid unto his fathers and saw
corruption

1337 But he whom God hath raised from the dead saw no corruption

1338 Be it known therefore to you men brethren that through him
forgiveness of sins is preached to you and from all the things from
which you could not be justified by the law of Moses

1339 In him every one that believeth is justified

1340 Beware therefore lest that come upon you which is spoken in
the prophets

1341 Behold ye despisers and wonder and perish for I work a work
in your days a work which you will not believe if any man shall tell
it you

1342 And as they went out they desired them that on the next sabbath
they would speak unto them these words

1343 And when the synagogue was broken up many of the Jews and of
the strangers who served God followed Paul and Barnabas who speaking
to them persuaded them to continue in the grace of God

1344 But the next sabbath day the whole city almost came together
to hear the word of God

1345 And the Jews seeing the multitudes were filled with envy and
contradicted those things which were said by Paul blaspheming

1346 Then Paul and Barnabas said boldly To you it behoved us first
to speak the word of God but because you reject it and judge
yourselves unworthy of eternal life behold we turn to the Gentiles

1347 For so the Lord hath commanded us I have set thee to be the
light of the Gentiles that thou mayest be for salvation unto the
utmost part of the earth

1348 And the Gentiles hearing it were glad and glorified the word of
the Lord and as many as were ordained to life everlasting believed

1349 And the word of the Lord was published throughout the whole
country

1350 But the Jews stirred up religious and honourable women and the
chief men of the city and raised persecution against Paul and
Barnabas and cast them out of their coasts

1351 But they shaking off the dust of their feet against them came
to Iconium

1352 And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost



Acts Chapter 14


Paul and Barnabas preach in Iconium and Lystra Paul heals a cripple
They are taken for gods Paul is stoned They preach in Derbe and
Perge

141 And it came to pass in Iconium that they entered together into
the synagogue of the Jews and so spoke that a very great multitude both
of the Jews and of the Greeks did believe

142 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up and incensed the minds of the
Gentiles against the brethren

143 A long time therefore they abode there dealing confidently in
the Lord who gave testimony to the word of his grace granting signs
and wonders to be done by their hands

144 And the multitude of the city was divided And some of them
indeed held with the Jews but some with the apostles

145 And when there was an assault made by the Gentiles and the Jews
with their rulers to use them contumeliously and to stone them

146 They understanding it fled to Lystra and Derbe cities of
Lycaonia and to the whole country round about and were there
preaching the gospel

147 And there sat a certain man at Lystra impotent in his feet a
cripple from his mothers womb who never had walked

148 This same heard Paul speaking Who looking upon him and seeing
that he had faith to be healed

149 Said with a loud voice Stand upright on thy feet And he leaped
up and walked

1410 And when the multitudes had seen what Paul had done they lifted
up their voice in the Lycaonian tongue saying The gods are come down
to us in the likeness of men

1411 And they called Barnabas Jupiter but Paul Mercury because he
was chief speaker

1412 The priest also of Jupiter that was before the city bringing
oxen and garlands before the gate would have offered sacrifice with
the people

1413 Which when the apostles Barnabas and Paul had heard rending
their clothes they leaped out among the people crying

1414 And saying Ye men why do ye these things We also are mortals
men like unto you preaching to you to be converted from these vain
things to the living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea
and all things that are in them

1415 Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own
ways

1416 Nevertheless he left not himself without testimony doing good
from heaven giving rains and fruitful Seasons filling our hearts with
food and gladness

1417 And speaking these things they scarce restrained the people
from sacrificing to them

1418 Now there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium
and persuading the multitude and stoning Paul drew him out of the
city thinking him to be dead

1419 But as the disciples stood round about him he rose up and
entered into the city and the next day he departed with Barnabas to
Derbe

1420 And when they had preached the gospel to that city and had
taught many they returned again to Lystra and to Iconium and to
Antioch

1421 Confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to
continue in the faith and that through many tribulations we must enter
into the kingdom of God

1422 And when they had ordained to them priests in every church and
had prayed with fasting they commended them to the Lord in whom they
believed

1423 And passing through Pisidia they came into Pamphylia

1424 And having spoken the word of the Lord in Perge they went down
into Attalia

1425 And thence they sailed to Antioch from whence they had been
delivered to the grace of God unto the work which they accomplished

1426 And when they were come and had assembled the church they
related what great things God had done with them and how he had opened
the door of faith to the Gentiles

1427 And they abode no small time with the disciples



Acts Chapter 15


A dissension about circumcision The decision and letter of the council
of Jerusalem

151 And some coming down from Judea taught the brethren That
except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be
saved

152 And when Paul and Barnabas had no small contest with them they
determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain others of the other side
should go up to the apostles and priests to Jerusalem about this
question

153 They therefore being brought on their way by the church passed
through Phenice and Samaria relating the conversion of the Gentiles
And they caused great joy to all the brethren

154 And when they were come to Jerusalem they were received by the
church and by the apostles and ancients declaring how great things God
had done with them

155 But there arose of the sect of the Pharisees some that believed
saying They must be circumcised and be commanded to observe the law of
Moses

156 And the apostles and ancients assembled to consider of this
matter

157 And when there had been much disputing Peter rising up said to
them Men brethren you know that in former days God made choice among
us that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel
and believe

158 And God who knoweth the hearts gave testimony giving unto them
the Holy Ghost as well as to us

159 And put no difference between us and them purifying their hearts
by faith

1510 Now therefore why tempt you God to put a yoke upon the necks of
the disciples which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear

1511 But by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we believe to be
saved in like manner as they also

1512 And all the multitude held their peace and they heard Barnabas
and Paul telling what great signs and wonders God had wrought among the
Gentiles by them

1513 And after they had held their peace James answered saying
Men brethren hear me

1514 Simon hath related how God first visited to take to the
Gentiles a people to his name

1515 And to this agree the words of the prophets as it is written

1516 After these things I will return and will rebuild the tabernacle
of David which is fallen down and the ruins thereof I will rebuild
And I will set it up

1517 That the residue of men may seek after the Lord and all nations
upon whom my name is invoked saith the Lord who doth these things

1518 To the Lord was his own work known from the beginning of the
world

1519 For which cause judge that they who from among the Gentiles are
converted to God are not to be disquieted

1520 But that we write unto them that they refrain themselves from
the pollutions of idols and from fornication and from things strangled
and from blood

1521 For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him in
the synagogues where he is read every sabbath

1522 Then it pleased the apostles and ancients with the whole
church to choose men of their own company and to send to Antioch with
Paul and Barnabas namely Judas who was surnamed Barsabas and Silas
chief men among the brethren

1523 Writing by their hands The apostles and ancients brethren to
the brethren of the Gentiles that are at Antioch and in Syria and
Cilicia greeting

1524 Forasmuch as we have heard that some going out from us have
troubled you with words subverting your souls to whom we gave no
commandment

1525 It hath seemed good to us being assembled together to choose
out men and to send them unto you with our well beloved Barnabas and
Paul

1526 Men that have given their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ

1527 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas who themselves also
will by word of mouth tell you the same things

1528 For it hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us to lay no
further burden upon you than these necessary things

1529 That you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood
and from things strangled and from fornication from which things
keeping yourselves you shall do well Fare ye well

From blood and from things strangled  The use of these things
though of their own nature indifferent was here prohibited to bring
the Jews more easily to admit of the society of the Gentiles and to
exercise the latter in obedience But this prohibition was but
temporary and has long since ceased to oblige more especially in the
western churches

1530 They therefore being dismissed went down to Antioch and
gathering together the multitude delivered the epistle

1531 Which when they had read they rejoiced for the consolation

1532 But Judas and Silas being prophets also themselves with many
words comforted the brethren and confirmed them

1533 And after they had spent some time there they were let go with
peace by the brethren unto them that had sent them

1534 But it seemed good unto Silas to remain there and Judas alone
departed to Jerusalem

1535 And Paul and Barnabas continued at Antioch teaching and
preaching with many others the word of the Lord

1536 And after some days Paul said to Barnabas Let us return and
visit our brethren in all the cities wherein we have preached the word
of the Lord to see how they do

1537 And Barnabas would have taken with them John also that was
surnamed Mark

1538 But Paul desired that he as having departed from them out of
Pamphylia and not gone with them to the work might not be received

1539 And there arose a dissension so that they departed one from
another And Barnabas indeed taking Mark sailed to Cyprus

1540 But Paul choosing Silas departed being delivered by the
brethren to the grace of God

1541 And he went through Syria and Cilicia confirming the churches
commanding them to keep the precepts of the apostles and the ancients



Acts Chapter 16


Paul visits the churches He is called to preach in Macedonia He is
scourged at Philippi

161 And he came to Derbe and Lystra And behold there was a certain
disciple there named Timothy the son of a Jewish woman that believed
but his father was a Gentile

162 To this man the brethren that were in Lystra and Iconium gave a
good testimony

163 Him Paul would have to go along with him and taking him he
circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places For they
all knew that his father was a Gentile

164 And as they passed through the cities they delivered unto them
the decrees for to keep that were decreed by the apostles and ancients
who were at Jerusalem

165 And the churches were confirmed in faith and increased in number
daily

166 And when they had passed through Phrygia and the country of
Galatia they were forbidden by the Holy Ghost to preach the word in
Asia

167 And when they were come into Mysia they attempted to go into
Bithynia and the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not

168 And when they had passed through Mysia they went down to Troas

169 And a vision was shewed to Paul in the night which was a man of
Macedonia standing and beseeching him and saying Pass over into
Macedonia and help us

1610 And as soon as he had seen the vision immediately we sought to
go into Macedonia being assured that God had called us to preach the
gospel to them

1611 And sailing from Troas we came with a straight course to
Samothracia and the day following to Neapolis

1612 And from thence to Philippi which is the chief city of part of
Macedonia a colony And we were in this city some days conferring
together

1613 And upon the Sabbath day we went forth without the gate by a
river side where it seemed that there was prayer and sitting down we
spoke to the women that were assembled

1614 And a certain woman named Lydia a seller of purple of the city
of Thyatira one that worshipped God did hear whose heart the Lord
opened to attend to those things which were said by Paul

1615 And when she was baptized and her household she besought us
saying If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord come into my
house and abide there And she constrained us

1616 And it came to pass as we went to prayer a certain girl having
a pythonical spirit met us who brought to her masters much gain by
divining

A pythonical spirit  That is a spirit pretending to divine and tell
fortunes

1617 This same following Paul and us cried out saying These men
are the servants of the Most High God who preach unto you the way of
salvation

1618 And this she did many days But Paul being grieved turned and
said to the spirit I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to go
from her And he went out the same hour

1619 But her masters seeing that the hope of their gain was gone
apprehending Paul and Silas brought them into the market place to the
rulers

1620 And presenting them to the magistrates they said These men
disturb our city being Jews

1621 And preach a fashion which it is not lawful for us to receive
nor observe being Romans

1622 And the people ran together against them and the magistrates
rending off their clothes commanded them to be beaten with rods

1623 And when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them
into prison charging the gaoler to keep them diligently

1624 Who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner
prison and made their feet fast in the stocks

1625 And at midnight Paul and Silas praying praised God And they
that were in prison heard them

1626 And suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the
foundations of the prison were shaken And immediately all the doors
were opened and the bands of all were loosed

1627 And the keeper of the prison awakening out of his sleep and
seeing the doors of the prison open drawing his sword would have
killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been fled

1628 But Paul cried with a loud voice saying Do thyself no harm
for we all are here

1629 Then calling for a light he went in and trembling fell down
at the feet of Paul and Silas

1630 And bringing them out he said Masters what must I do that I
may be saved

1631 But they said believe in the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be
saved and thy house

1632 And they preached the word of the Lord to him and to all that
were in his house

1633 And he taking them the same hour of the night washed their
stripes and himself was baptized and all his house immediately

1634 And when he had brought them into his own house he laid the
table for them and rejoiced with all his house believing God

1635 And when the day was come the magistrates sent the serjeants
saying Let those men go

1636 And the keeper of the prison told these words to Paul The
magistrates have sent to let you go Now therefore depart And go in
peace

1637 But Paul said to them They have beaten us publicly
uncondemned men that are Romans and have cast us into prison And now
do they thrust us out privately Not so but let them come

1638 And let us out themselves And the serjeants told these words to
the magistrates And they were afraid hearing that they were Romans

1639 And coming they besought them and bringing them out they
desired them to depart out of the city

1640 And they went out of the prison and entered into the house of
Lydia and having seen the brethren they comforted them and departed



Acts Chapter 17


Paul preaches to the Thessalonians and Bereans His discourse to the
Athenians

171 And when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia they
came to Thessalonica where there was a synagogue of the Jews

172 And Paul according to his custom went in unto them And for
three sabbath days he reasoned with them out of the scriptures

173 Declaring and insinuating that the Christ was to suffer and to
rise again from the dead and that this is Jesus Christ whom I preach
to you

174 And some of them believed and were associated to Paul and Silas
and of those that served God and of the Gentiles a great multitude and
of noble women not a few

175 But the Jews moved with envy and taking unto them some wicked
men of the vulgar sort and making a tumult set the city in an uproar
and besetting Jasons house sought to bring them out unto the people

176 And not finding them they drew Jason and certain brethren to the
rulers of the city crying They that set the city in an uproar are
come hither also

City Urbem  In the Greek the world

177 Whom Jason hath received And these all do contrary to the
decrees of Caesar saying that there is another king Jesus

178 And they stirred up the people and the rulers of the city
hearing these things

179 And having taken satisfaction of Jason and of the rest they let
them go

1710 But the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night
unto Berea Who when they were come thither went into the synagogue
of the Jews

1711 Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica who
received the word with all eagerness daily searching the scriptures
whether these things were so

More noble  The Jews of Berea are justly commended for their eagerly
embracing the truth and searching the scriptures to find out the
texts alleged by the apostle which was a far more generous proceeding
than that of their countrymen at Thessalonica who persecuted the
preachers of the gospel without examining the grounds they alleged for
what they taught

1712 And many indeed of them believed and of honourable women that
were Gentiles and of men not a few

1713 And when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of
God was also preached by Paul at Berea they came thither also
stirring up and troubling the multitude

1714 And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go unto the
sea but Silas and Timothy remained there

1715 And they that conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens and
receiving a commandment from him to Silas and Timothy that they should
come to him with all speed they departed

1716 Now whilst Paul waited for them at Athens his spirit was
stirred within him seeing the city wholly given to idolatry

1717 He disputed therefore in the synagogue with the Jews and with
them that served God and in the market place every day with them
that were there

1718 And certain philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoics
disputed with him And some said What is it that this word sower would
say But others He seemeth to be a setter forth of new gods Because
he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection

1719 And taking him they brought him to the Areopagus saying May
we know what this new doctrine is which thou speakest of

1720 For thou bringest in certain new things to our ears We would
know therefore what these things mean

1721 Now all the Athenians and strangers that were there employed
themselves in nothing else but either in telling or in hearing some
new thing

1722 But Paul standing in the midst of the Areopagus said Ye men
of Athens I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious

1723 For passing by and seeing your idols I found an altar also on
which was written To the Unknown God What therefore you worship
without knowing it that I preach to you

1724 God who made the world and all things therein he being Lord of
heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands

Dwelleth not in temples  God is not contained in temples so as to
need them for his dwelling or any other uses as the heathens
imagined Yet by his omnipresence he is both there and everywhere

1725 Neither is he served with mens hands as though he needed any
thing seeing it is he who giveth to all life and breath and all
things

1726 And hath made of one all mankind to dwell upon the whole face
of the earth determining appointed times and the limits of their
habitation

1727 That they should seek God if haply they may feel after him or
find him although he be not far from every one of us

1728 For in him we live and move and are as some also of your own
poets said For we are also his offspring

1729 Being therefore the offspring of God we must not suppose the
divinity to be like unto gold or silver or stone the graving of art
and device of man

1730 And God indeed having winked at the times of this ignorance now
declareth unto men that all should every where do penance

1731 Because he hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world
in equity by the man whom he hath appointed giving faith to all by
raising him up from the dead

1732 And when they had heard of the resurrection of the dead some
indeed mocked But others said We will hear thee again concerning this
matter

1733 So Paul went out from among them

1734 But certain men adhering to him did believe among whom was
also Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with
them



Acts Chapter 18


Paul founds the church of Corinth and preaches at Ephesus and in other
places Apollo goes to Corinth

181 After these things departing from Athens he came to Corinth

182 And finding a certain Jew named Aquila born in Pontus lately
come from Italy with Priscilla his wife because that Claudius had
commanded all Jews to depart from Rome he came to them

183 And because he was of the same trade he remained with them and
wrought Now they were tentmakers by trade

184 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath bringing in the
name of the Lord Jesus And he persuaded the Jews and the Greeks

185 And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia Paul was
earnest in preaching testifying to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ

186 But they gainsaying and blaspheming he shook his garments and
said to them Your blood be upon your own heads I am clean From
henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles

187 And departing thence he entered into the house of a certain man
named Titus Justus one that worshipped God whose house was adjoining
to the synagogue

188 And Crispus the ruler of the synagogue believed in the Lord
with all his house And many of the Corinthians hearing believed and
were baptized

189 And the Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision Do not fear
but speak And hold not thy peace

1810 Because I am with thee and no man shall set upon thee to hurt
thee For I have much people in this city

1811 And he stayed there a year and six months teaching among them
the word of God

1812 But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia the Jews with one
accord rose up against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat

1813 Saying This man persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the
law

1814 And when Paul was beginning to open his mouth Gallio said to
the Jews If it were some matter of injustice or an heinous deed O
Jews I should with reason bear with you

1815 But if they be questions of word and names and of your law look
you to it I will not be judge of such things

1816 And he drove them from the judgment seat

1817 And all laying hold on Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue
beat him before the judgment seat And Gallio cared for none of those
things

1818 But Paul when he had stayed yet many days taking his leave of
the brethren sailed thence into Syria and with him Priscilla and
Aquila having shorn his head in Cenchrae For he had a vow

1819 And he came to Ephesus and left them there But he himself
entering into the synagogue disputed with the Jews

1820 And when they desired him that he would tarry a longer time he
consented not

1821 But taking his leave and saying I will return to you again God
willing he departed from Ephesus

1822 And going down to Caesarea he went up to Jerusalem and saluted
the church and so came down to Antioch

1823 And after he had spent some time there he departed and went
through the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order confirming all
the disciples

1824 Now a certain Jew named Apollo born at Alexandria an eloquent
man came to Ephesus one mighty in the scriptures

1825 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord and being
fervent in spirit spoke and taught diligently the things that are of
Jesus knowing only the baptism of John

1826 This man therefore began to speak boldly in the synagogue Whom
when Priscilla and Aquila had heard they took him to them and
expounded to him the way of the Lord more diligently

1827 And whereas he was desirous to go to Achaia the brethren
exhorting wrote to the disciples to receive him Who when he was come
helped them much who had believed

1828 For with much vigour he convinced the Jews openly shewing by
the scriptures that Jesus is the Christ



Acts Chapter 19


Paul establishes the church at Ephesus The tumult of the silversmiths

191 And it came to pass while Apollo was at Corinth that Paul
having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus and found
certain disciples

192 And he said to them Have you received the Holy Ghost since ye
believed But they said to him We have not so much as heard whether
there be a Holy Ghost

193 And he said In what then were you baptized Who said In Johns
baptism

194 Then Paul said John baptized the people with the baptism of
penance saying That they should believe in him who was to come after
him that is to say in Jesus

195 Having heard these things they were baptized in the name of the
Lord Jesus

196 And when Paul had imposed his hands on them the Holy Ghost came
upon them and they spoke with tongues and prophesied

197 And all the men were about twelve

198 And entering into the synagogue he spoke boldly for the space of
three months disputing and exhorting concerning the kingdom of God

199 But when some were hardened and believed not speaking evil of
the way of the Lord before the multitude departing from them he
separated the disciples disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus

1910 And this continued for the space of two years so that all who
dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord both Jews and Gentiles

1911 And God wrought by the hand of Paul more than common miracles

1912 So that even there were brought from his body to the sick
handkerchiefs and aprons and the diseases departed from them and the
wicked spirits went out of them

1913 Now some also of the Jewish exorcists who went about attempted
to invoke over them that had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus
saying I conjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth

1914 And there were certain men seven sons of Sceva a Jew a chief
priest that did this

1915 But the wicked spirit answering said to them Jesus I know
and Paul I know But who are you

1916 And the man in whom the wicked spirit was leaping upon them and
mastering them both prevailed against them so that they fled out of
that house naked and wounded

1917 And this became known to all the Jews and the Gentiles that
dwelt a Ephesus And fear fell on them all and the name of the Lord
Jesus was magnified

1918 And many of them that believed came confessing and declaring
their deeds

1919 And many of them who had followed curious arts brought together
their books and burnt them before all And counting the price of them
they found the money to be fifty thousand pieces of silver

1920 So mightily grew the word of God and was confirmed

1921 And when these things were ended Paul purposed in the spirit
when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia to go to Jerusalem
saying After I have been there I must see Rome also

1922 And sending into Macedonia two of them that ministered to him
Timothy and Erastus he himself remained for a time in Asia

1923 Now at that time there arose no small disturbance about the way
of the Lord

1924 For a certain man named Demetrius a silversmith who made
silver temples for Diana brought no small gain to the craftsmen

1925 Whom he calling together with the workmen of like occupation
said Sirs you know that our gain is by this trade

1926 And you see and hear that this Paul by persuasion hath drawn
away a great multitude not only of Ephesus but almost of all Asia
saying they are not gods which are made by hands

1927 So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at
nought but also the temple of great Diana shall be reputed for
nothing Yea and her majesty shall begin to be destroyed whom all
Asia and the world worshippeth

1928 Having heard these things they were full of anger and cried
out saying Great is Diana of the Ephesians

1929 And the whole city was filled with confusion And having caught
Gaius and Aristarchus men of Macedonia Pauls companions they rushed
with one accord into the theatre

1930 And when Paul would have entered in unto the people the
disciples suffered him not

1931 And some also of the rulers of Asia who were his friends sent
unto him desiring that he would not venture himself into the theatre

1932 Now some cried one thing some another For the assembly was
confused and the greater part knew not for what cause they were come
together

1933 And they drew forth Alexander out of the multitude the Jews
thrusting him forward And Alexander beckoning with his hand for
silence would have given the people satisfaction

1934 But as soon as they perceived him to be a Jew all with one
voice for the space of about two hours cried out Great is Diana of
the Ephesians

1935 And when the town clerk had appeased the multitudes he said Ye
men of Ephesus what man is there that knoweth not that the city of the
Ephesians is a worshipper of the great Diana and of Jupiters
offspring

1936 For as much therefore as these things cannot be contradicted
you ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly

1937 For you have brought hither these men who are neither guilty of
sacrilege nor of blasphemy against your goddess

1938 But if Demetrius and the craftsmen that are with him have a
matter against any man the courts of justice are open and there are
proconsuls Let them accuse one another

1939 And if you inquire after any other matter it may be decided in
a lawful assembly

1940 For we are even in danger to be called in question for this
days uproar there being no man guilty of whom we may give account
of this concourse And when he had said these things he dismissed the
assembly



Acts Chapter 20


Paul passes through Macedonia and Greece He raises a dead man to life
at Troas His discourse to the clergy of Ephesus

201 And after the tumult was ceased Paul calling to him the
disciples and exhorting them took his leave and set forward to go into
Macedonia

202 And when he had gone over those parts and had exhorted them with
many words he came into Greece

203 Where when he had spent three months the Jews laid wait for
him as he was about to sail into Syria So he took a resolution to
return through Macedonia

204 And there accompanied him Sopater the son of Pyrrhus of Berea
and of the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus and Gaius of Derbe
and Timothy and of Asia Tychicus and Trophimus

205 These going before stayed for us at Troas

206 But we sailed from Philippi after the days of the azymes and came
to them to Troas in five days where we abode seven days

207 And on the first day of the week when we were assembled to break
bread Paul discoursed with them being to depart on the morrow And he
continued his speech until midnight

And on the first day of the week  Here St Chrysostom and many other
interpreters of the scripture explain that the Christians even at this
time must have changed the sabbath into the first day of the week
the Lords day as all Christians now keep it This change was
undoubtedly made by the authority of the church hence the exercise of
the power which Christ had given to her for he is Lord of the
sabbath

208 And there were a great number of lamps in the upper chamber where
we were assembled

209 And a certain young man named Eutychus sitting on the window
being oppressed with a deep sleep as Paul was long preaching by
occasion of his sleep fell from the third loft down and was taken up
dead

2010 To whom when Paul had gone down he laid himself upon him and
embracing him said Be not troubled for his soul is in him

2011 Then going up and breaking bread and tasting and having talked a
long time to them until daylight so he departed

2012 And they brought the youth alive and were not a little
comforted

2013 But we going aboard the ship sailed to Assos being there to
take in Paul For so he had appointed himself purposing to travel by
land

2014 And when he had met with us at Assos we took him in and came to
Mitylene

2015 And sailing thence the day following we came over against
Chios and the next day we arrived at Samos and the day following we
came to Miletus

2016 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus lest he should be
stayed any time in Asia For he hasted if it were possible for him to
keep the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem

2017 And sending from Miletus to Ephesus he called the ancients of
the church

2018 And when they were come to him and were together he said to
them You know from the first day that I came into Asia in what manner
I have been with you for all the time

2019 Serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and
temptations which befell me by the conspiracies of the Jews

2020 How I have kept back nothing that was profitable to you but
have preached it to you and taught you publicly and from house to
house

2021 Testifying both to Jews and Gentiles penance towards God and
faith in our Lord Jesus Christ

2022 And now behold being bound in the spirit I go to Jerusalem
not knowing the things which shall befall me there

2023 Save that the Holy Ghost in every city witnesseth to me saying
That bands and afflictions wait for me at Jerusalem

2024 But I fear none of these things neither do I count my life more
precious than myself so that I may consummate my course and the
ministry of the word which I received from the Lord Jesus to testify
the gospel of the grace of God

2025 And now behold I know that all you among whom I have gone
preaching the kingdom of God shall see my face no more

2026 Wherefore I take you to witness this day that I am clear from
the blood of all men

2027 For I have not spread to declare unto you all the counsel of
God

2028 Take heed to yourselves and to the whole flock wherein the Holy
Ghost hath placed you bishops to rule the Church of God which he hath
purchased with his own blood

2029 I know that after my departure ravening wolves will enter in
among you not sparing the flock

2030 And of your own selves shall arise men speaking perverse things
to draw away disciples after them

2031 Therefore watch keeping in memory that for three years I ceased
not with tears to admonish every one of you night and day

2032 And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace who
is able to build up and to give an inheritance among all the
sanctified

2033 I have not coveted any mans silver gold or apparel as

2034 You yourselves know For such things as were needful for me and
them that are with me these hands have furnished

2035 I have shewed you all things how that so labouring you ought to
support the weak and to remember the word of the Lord Jesus how he
said It is a more blessed thing to give rather than to receive

2036 And when he had said these things kneeling down he prayed with
them all

2037 And there was much weeping among them all And falling on the
neck of Paul they kissed him

2038 Being grieved most of all for the word which he had said that
they should see his face no more And they brought him on his way to
the ship



Acts Chapter 21


Paul goes up to Jerusalem He is apprehended by the Jews in the temple

211 And when it came to pass that being parted from them we set
sail we came with a straight course to Coos and the day following to
Rhodes and from thence to Patara

212 And when we had found a ship sailing over to Phenice we went
aboard and set forth

213 And when we had discovered Cyprus leaving it on the left hand
we sailed into Syria and came to Tyre for there the ship was to
unlade her burden

214 And finding disciples we tarried there seven days who said to
Paul through the Spirit that he should not go up to Jerusalem

215 And the days being expired departing we went forward they all
bringing us on our way with their wives and children till we were out
of the city And we kneeled down on the shore and we prayed

216 And when we had bid one another farewell we took ship And they
returned home

217 But we having finished the voyage by sea from Tyre came down to
Ptolemais and saluting the brethren we abode one day with them

218 And the next day departing we came to Caesarea And entering
into the house of Philip the evangelist who was one of the seven we
abode with him

The evangelist  That is the preacher of the gospel the same that
before converted the Samaritans and baptized the eunuch chap 8
being one of the first seven deacons

219 And he had four daughters virgins who did prophesy

2110 And as we tarried there for some days there came from Judea a
certain prophet named Agabus

2111 Who when he was come to us took Pauls girdle and binding his
own feet and hands he said Thus saith the Holy Ghost The man whose
girdle this is the Jews shall bind in this manner in Jerusalem and
shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles

2112 Which when we had heard both we and they that were of that
place desired him that he would not go up to Jerusalem

2113 Then Paul answered and said What do you mean weeping and
afflicting my heart For I am ready not only to be bound but to die
also in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus

2114 And when we could not persuade him we ceased saying The will
of the Lord be done

2115 And after those days being prepared we went up to Jerusalem

2116 And there went also with us some of the disciples from Caesarea
bringing with them one Mnason a Cyprian an old disciple with whom we
should lodge

2117 And when we were come to Jerusalem the brethren received us
gladly

2118 And the day following Paul went in with us unto James and all
the ancients were assembled

2119 Whom when he had saluted he related particularly what things
God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry

2120 But they hearing it glorified God and said to him Thou seest
brother how many thousands there are among the Jews that have
believed and they are all zealous for the law

2121 Now they have heard of thee that thou teachest those Jews who
are among the Gentiles to depart from Moses saying that they ought not
to circumcise their children nor walk according to the custom

2122 What is it therefore The multitude must needs come together
for they will hear that thou art come

2123 Do therefore this that we say to thee We have four men who
have a vow on them

2124 Take these and sanctify thyself with them and bestow on them
that they may shave their heads And all will know that the things
which they have heard of these are false but that thou thyself also
walkest keeping the law

Keeping the law  The law though now no longer obligatory was for a
time observed by the Christian Jews to bury as it were the synagogue
with honour

2125 But as touching the Gentiles that believe we have written
decreeing that they should only refrain themselves from that which has
been offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from
fornication

2126 Then Paul took the men and the next day being purified with
them entered into the temple giving notice of the accomplishment of
the days of purification until an oblation should be offered for every
one of them

2127 But when the seven days were drawing to an end those Jews that
were of Asia when they saw him in the temple stirred up all the
people and laid hands upon him crying out

2128 Men of Israel help This is the man that teacheth all men every
where against the people and the law and this place and moreover hath
brought in Gentiles into the temple and hath violated this holy place

2129 For they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him
whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple

2130 And he whole city was in an uproar and the people ran together
And taking Paul they drew him out of the temple and immediately the
doors were shut

2131 And as they went about to kill him it was told the tribune of
the band that all Jerusalem was in confusion

2132 Who forthwith taking with him soldiers and centurions ran down
to them And when they saw the tribune and the soldiers they left off
beating Paul

2133 Then the tribune coming near took him and commanded him to be
bound with two chains and demanded who he was and what he had done

2134 And some cried one thing some another among the multitude And
when he could not know the certainty for the tumult he commanded him
to be carried into the castle

2135 And when he was come to the stairs it fell out that he was
carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the people

2136 For the multitude of the people followed after crying Away
with him

2137 And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle he saith to
the tribune May I speak something to thee Who said Canst thou speak
Greek

2138 Art not thou that Egyptian who before these days didst raise a
tumult and didst lead forth into the desert four thousand men that were
murderers

2139 But Paul said to him I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia a citizen
of no mean city And I beseech thee suffer me to speak to the people

2140 And when he had given him leave Paul standing on the stairs
beckoned with his hand to the people And a great silence being made
he spoke unto them in the Hebrew tongue saying



Acts Chapter 22


Paul declares to the people the history of his conversion He escapes
scourging by claiming the privilege of a Roman citizen

221 Men brethren and fathers hear ye the account which I now give
unto you

222 And when they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue
they kept the more silence

223 And he saith I am a Jew born at Tarsus in Cilicia but brought
up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel taught according to the truth
of the law of the fathers zealous for the law as also all you are
this day

224 Who persecuted this way unto death binding and delivering into
prisons both men and women

225 As the high priest doth bear me witness and all the ancients
From whom also receiving letters to the brethren I went to Damascus
that I might bring them bound from thence to Jerusalem to be punished

226 And it came to pass as I was going and drawing nigh to Damascus
at midday that suddenly from heaven there shone round about me a
great light

227 And falling on the ground I heard a voice saying to me Saul
Saul why persecutest thou me

228 And I answered Who art thou Lord And he said to me I am
Jesus of Nazareth whom thou persecutest

229 And they that were with me saw indeed the light but they heard
not the voice of him that spoke with me

Heard not the voice  That is they distinguished not the words
though they heard the voice Acts 9 7

2210 And I said What shall I do Lord And the Lord said to me
Arise and go to Damascus and there it shall be told thee of all things
that thou must do

2211 And whereas I did not see for the brightness of that light
being led by the hand by my companions I came to Damascus

2212 And one Ananias a man according to the law having testimony of
all the Jews who dwelt there

2213 Coming to me and standing by me said to me Brother Saul look
up And I the same hour looked upon him

2214 But he said The God of our fathers hath preordained thee that
thou shouldst know his will and see the Just One and shouldst hear the
voice from his mouth

Just One  Our Saviour who appeared to St Paul Acts 9 17

2215 For thou shalt be his witness to all men of those things which
thou hast seen and heard

2216 And now why tarriest thou Rise up and be baptized and wash away
thy sins invoking his name

2217 And it came to pass when I was come again to Jerusalem and was
praying in the temple that I was in a trance

2218 And saw him saying unto me Make haste and get thee quickly out
of Jerusalem because they will not receive thy testimony concerning
me

2219 And I said Lord they know that I cast into prison and beat in
every synagogue them that believed in thee

2220 And when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed I stood by
and consented and kept the garments of them that killed him

2221 And he said to me Go for unto the Gentiles afar off will I
send thee

2222 And they heard him until this word and then lifted up their
voice saying Away with such an one from the earth For it is not fit
that he should live

2223 And as they cried out and threw off their garments and cast dust
into the air

2224 The tribune commanded him to be brought into the castle and
that he should be scourged and tortured to know for what cause they
did so cry out against him

2225 And when they had bound him with thongs Paul saith to the
centurion that stood by him Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that
is a Roman and uncondemned

2226 Which the centurion hearing went to the tribune and told him
saying What art thou about to do For this man is a Roman citizen

2227 And the tribune coming said to him Tell me Art thou a Roman
But he said Yea

2228 And the tribune answered I obtained the being free of this city
with a great sum And Paul said But I was born so

2229 Immediately therefore they departed from him that were about to
torture him The tribune also was afraid after he understood that he
was a Roman citizen and because he had bound him

2230 But on the next day meaning to know more diligently for what
cause he was accused by the Jews he loosed him and commanded the
priests to come together and all the council and bringing forth Paul
he set him before them



Acts Chapter 23


Paul stands before the council The Jews conspire his death He is sent
away to Cesarea

231 And Paul looking upon the council said Men brethren I have
conversed with all good conscience before God until this present day

232 And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to
strike him on the mouth

233 Then Paul said to him God shall strike thee thou whited wall
For sittest thou to judge me according to the law and contrary to the
law commandest me to be struck

234 And they that stood by said Dost thou revile the high priest of
God

235 And Paul said I knew not brethren that he is the high priest
For it is written Thou shalt not speak evil of the prince of thy
people

236 And Paul knowing that the one part were Sadducees and the other
Pharisees cried out in the council Men brethren I am a Pharisee
the son of Pharisees concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead
I am called in question

237 And when he had so said there arose a dissension between the
Pharisees and the Sadducees And the multitude was divided

238 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection neither
angel nor spirit but the Pharisees confess both

239 And there arose a great cry And some of the Pharisees rising up
strove saying We find no evil in this man What if a spirit hath
spoken to him or an angel

2310 And when there arose a great dissension the tribune fearing
lest Paul should be pulled in pieces by them commanded the soldiers to
go down and to take him by force from among them and to bring him into
the castle

2311 And the night following the Lord standing by him said Be
constant for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem so must thou
bear witness also at Rome

2312 And when day was come some of the Jews gathered together and
bound themselves under a curse saying that they would neither eat nor
drink till they killed Paul

2313 And they were more than forty men that had made this conspiracy

2314 Who came to the chief priests and the ancients and said We have
bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing till we
have slain Paul

2315 Now therefore do you with the council signify to the tribune
that he bring him forth to you as if you meant to know something more
certain touching him And we before he come near are ready to kill
him

2316 Which when Pauls sisters son had heard of their lying in
wait he came and entered into the castle and told Paul

2317 And Paul calling to him one of the centurions said Bring this
young man to the tribune for he hath some thing to tell him

2318 And he taking him brought him to the tribune and said Paul
the prisoner desired me to bring this young man unto thee who hath
some thing to say to thee

2319 And the tribune taking him by the hand went aside with him
privately and asked him What is it that thou hast to tell me

2320 And he said The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou
wouldst bring forth Paul tomorrow into the council as if they meant
to inquire some thing more certain touching him

2321 But do not thou give credit to them for there lie in wait for
him more than forty men of them who have bound themselves by oath
neither to eat nor to drink till they have killed him And they are
now ready looking for a promise from thee

2322 The tribune therefore dismissed the young man charging him that
he should tell no man that he had made known these things unto him

2323 Then having called two centurions he said to them Make ready
two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea and seventy horsemen and
two hundred spearmen for the third hour of the night

2324 And provide beasts that they may set Paul on and bring him safe
to Felix the governor

2325 For he feared lest perhaps the Jews might take him away by
force and kill him and he should afterwards be slandered as if he was
to take money And he wrote a letter after this manner

2326 Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix greeting

2327 This man being taken by the Jews and ready to be killed by
them I rescued coming in with an army understanding that he is a
Roman

2328 And meaning to know the cause which they objected unto him I
brought him forth into their council

2329 Whom I found to be accused concerning questions of their law
but having nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bands

2330 And when I was told of ambushes that they had prepared for him
I sent him to thee signifying also to his accusers to plead before
thee Farewell

2331 Then the soldiers according as it was commanded them taking
Paul brought him by night to Antipatris

2332 And the next day leaving the horsemen to go with him they
returned to the castle

2333 Who when they were come to Caesarea and had delivered the
letter to the governor did also present Paul before him

2334 And when he had read it and had asked of what province he was
and understood that he was of Cilicia

2335 I will hear thee said he when thy accusers come And he
commanded him to be kept in Herods judgment hall



Acts Chapter 24


Paul defends his innocence before Felix the governor He preaches the
faith to him

241 And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with
some ancients and one Tertullus an orator who went to the governor
against Paul

242 And Paul being called for Tertullus began to accuse him saying
Whereas through thee we live in much peace and many things are
rectified by thy providence

243 We accept it always and in all places most excellent Felix with
all thanksgiving

244 But that I be no further tedious to thee I desire thee of thy
clemency to hear us in a few words

245 We have found this to be a pestilent man and raising seditions
among all the Jews throughout the world and author of the sedition of
the sect of the Nazarenes

246 Who also hath gone about to profane the temple whom we having
apprehended would also have judged according to our law

247 But Lysias the tribune coming upon us with great violence took
him away out of our hands

248 Commanding his accusers to come to thee Of whom thou mayest
thyself by examination have knowledge of all these things whereof we
accuse him

249 And the Jews also added and said that these things were so

2410 Then Paul answered the governor making a sign to him to speak
Knowing that for many years thou hast been judge over this nation I
will with good courage answer for myself

2411 For thou mayest understand that there are yet but twelve days
since I went up to adore in Jerusalem

2412 And neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any
man or causing any concourse of the people neither in the synagogues
nor in the city

2413 Neither can they prove unto thee the things whereof they now
accuse me

2414 But this I confess to thee that according to the way which they
call a heresy so do I serve the Father and my God believing all
things which are written in the law and the prophets

2415 Having hope in God which these also themselves look for that
there shall be a resurrection of the just and unjust

2416 And herein do I endeavour to have always a conscience without
offence towards God and towards men

2417 Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation and
offerings and vows

2418 In which I was found purified in the temple neither with
multitude nor with tumult

2419 But certain Jews of Asia who ought to be present before thee
and to accuse if they had anything against me

2420 Or let these men themselves say if they found in me any
iniquity when standing before the council

2421 Except it be for this one voice only that I cried standing
among them Concerning the resurrection of the dead am I judged this
day by you

2422 And Felix put them off having most certain knowledge of this
way saying When Lysias the tribune shall come down I will hear you

2423 And he commanded a centurion to keep him and that he should be
easy and that he should not prohibit any of his friends to minister
unto him

2424 And after some days Felix coming with Drusilla his wife who
was a Jew sent for Paul and heard of him the faith that is in Christ
Jesus

2425 And as he treated of justice and chastity and of the judgment to
come Felix being terrified answered For this time go thy way but
when I have a convenient time I will send for thee

2426 Hoping also withal that money should be given him by Paul for
which cause also oftentimes sending for him he spoke with him

2427 But when two years were ended Felix had for successor Portius
Festus And Felix being willing to shew the Jews a pleasure left Paul
bound



Acts Chapter 25


Paul appeals to Caesar King Agrippa desires to hear him

251 Now when Festus was come into the province after three days he
went up to Jerusalem from Cesarea

252 And the chief priests and principal men of the Jews went unto him
against Paul and they besought him

253 Requesting favour against him that he would command him to be
brought to Jerusalem laying wait to kill him in the way

254 But Festus answered That Paul was kept in Caesarea and that he
himself would very shortly depart thither

255 Let them therefore saith he among you that are able go down
with me and accuse him if there be any crime in the man

256 And having tarried among them no more than eight or ten days he
went down to Caesarea And the next day he sat in the judgment seat
and commanded Paul to be brought

257 Who being brought the Jews stood about him who were come down
from Jerusalem objecting many and grievious causes which they could
not prove

258 Paul making answer for himself Neither against the law of the
Jews nor against the temple nor against Caesar have I offended in
any thing

259 But Festus willing to shew the Jews a pleasure answering Paul
said Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem and there be judged of these things
before me

2510 Then Paul said I stand at Caesars judgment seat where I ought
to be judged To the Jews I have done no injury as thou very well
knowest

2511 For if I have injured them or have committed any thing worthy of
death I refuse not to die But if there be none of these things
whereof they accuse me no man may deliver me to them I appeal to
Caesar

2512 Then Festus having conferred with the council answered Hast
thou appealed to Caesar To Caesar shalt thou go

2513 And after some days king Agrippa and Bernice came down to
Caesarea to salute Festus

2514 And as they tarried there many days Festus told the king of
Paul saying A certain man was left prisoner by Felix

2515 About whom when I was at Jerusalem the chief priests and the
ancients of the Jews came unto me desiring condemnation against him

2516 To whom I answered it is not the custom of the Romans to
condemn any man before that he who is accused have his accusers
present and have liberty to make his answer to clear himself of the
things laid to his charge

2517 When therefore they were come hither without any delay on the
day following sitting in the judgment seat I commanded the man to be
brought

2518 Against whom when the accusers stood up they brought no
accusation of this which I thought ill of

2519 But had certain questions of their own superstition against him
and of one Jesus deceased whom Paul affirmed to be alive

2520 I therefore being in a doubt of this manner of question asked
him whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be judged of these
things

2521 But Paul appealing to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus
I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar

2522 And Agrippa said to Festus I would also hear the man myself
Tomorrow said he thou shalt hear him

2523 And on the next day when Agrippa and Bernice were come with
great pomp and had entered into the hall of audience with the tribunes
and principal men of the city at Festus commandment Paul was brought
forth

2524 And Festus saith King Agrippa and all ye men who are here
present with us you see this man about whom all the multitude of the
Jews dealt with me at Jerusalem requesting and crying out that he
ought not to live any longer

2525 Yet have I found nothing that he hath committed worthy of death
But forasmuch as he himself hath appealed to Augustus I have
determined to send him

2526 Of whom I have nothing certain to write to my lord For which
cause I have brought him forth before you and especially before thee
O king Agrippa that examination being made I may have what to write

2527 For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not to
signify the things laid to his charge



Acts Chapter 26


Paul gives an account to Agrippa of his life conversion and calling

261 Then Agrippa said to Paul Thou art permitted to speak for
thyself Then Paul stretching forth his hand began to make his
answer

262 I think myself happy O king Agrippa that I am to answer for
myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am
accused by the Jews

263 Especially as thou knowest all both customs and questions that
are among the Jews Wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently

264 And my life indeed from my youth which was from the beginning
among my own nation in Jerusalem all the Jews do know

265 Having known me from the beginning if they will give testimony
that according to the most sure sect of our religion I lived a
Pharisee

266 And now for the hope of the promise that was made by God to the
fathers do I stand subject to judgment

267 Unto which our twelve tribes serving night and day hope to
come For which hope O king I am accused by the Jews

268 Why should it be thought a thing incredible that God should raise
the dead

269 And I indeed did formerly think that I ought to do many things
contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth

2610 Which also I did at Jerusalem and many of the saints did I shut
up in prison having received authority of the chief priests And when
they were put to death I brought the sentence

2611 And oftentimes punishing them in every synagogue I compelled
them to blaspheme and being yet more mad against them I persecuted
them even unto foreign cities

2612 Whereupon when I was going to Damascus with authority and
permission of the chief priest

2613 At midday O king I saw in the way a light from heaven above
the brightness of the sun shining round about me and them that were in
company with me

2614 And when we were all fallen down on the ground I heard a voice
speaking to me in the Hebrew tongue Saul Saul why persecutest thou
me It is hard for thee to kick against the good

2615 And I said Who art thou Lord And the Lord answered I am
Jesus whom thou persecutest

2616 But rise up and stand upon thy feet for to this end have I
appeared to thee that I may make thee a minister and a witness of
those things which thou hast seen and of those things wherein I will
appear to thee

2617 Delivering thee from the people and from the nations unto which
now I send thee

2618 To open their eyes that they may be converted from darkness to
light and from the power of Satan to God that they may receive
forgiveness of sins and a lot among the saints by the faith that is in
me

2619 Whereupon O king Agrippa I was not incredulous to the heavenly
vision

2620 But to them first that are at Damascus and at Jerusalem and
unto all the country of Judea and to the Gentiles did I preach that
they should do penance and turn to God doing works worthy of penance

2621 For this cause the Jews when I was in the temple having
apprehended me went about to kill me

2622 But being aided by the help of God I stand unto this day
witnessing both to small and great saying no other thing than those
which the prophets and Moses did say should come to pass

2623 That Christ should suffer and that he should be the first that
should rise from the dead and should shew light to the people and to
the Gentiles

2624 As he spoke these things and made his answer Festus said with a
loud voice Paul thou art beside thyself much learning doth make thee
mad

2625 And Paul said I am not mad most excellent Festus but I speak
words of truth and soberness

2626 For the king knoweth of these things to whom also I speak with
confidence For I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden
from him For neither was any of these things done in a corner

2627 Believest thou the prophets O king Agrippa I know that thou
believest

2628 And Agrippa said to Paul In a little thou persuadest me to
become a Christian

2629 And Paul said I would to God that both in a little and in much
not only thou but also all that hear me this day should become such
as I also am except these bands

2630 And the king rose up and the governor and Bernice and they that
sat with them

2631 And when they were gone aside they spoke among themselves
saying This man hath done nothing worthy of death or of bands

2632 And Agrippa said to Festus This man might have been set at
liberty if he had not appealed to Caesar



Acts Chapter 27


Paul is shipped for Rome His voyage and shipwreck

271 And when it was determined that he should sail into Italy and
that Paul with the other prisoners should be delivered to a
centurion named Julius of the band Augusta

272 Going on board a ship of Adrumetum we launched meaning to sail
by the coasts of Asia Aristarchus the Macedonian of Thessalonica
continuing with us

273 And the day following we came to Sidon And Julius treating
Paul courteously permitted him to go to his friends and to take care
of himself

274 And when we had launched from thence we sailed under Cyprus
because the winds were contrary

275 And sailing over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia we came to
Lystra which is in Lycia

276 And there the centurion finding a ship of Alexandria sailing
into Italy removed us into it

277 And when for many days we had sailed slowly and were scarce come
over against Gnidus the wind not suffering us we sailed near Crete by
Salmone

278 And with much ado sailing by it we came into a certain place
which is called Goodhavens nigh to which was the city of Thalassa

279 And when much time was spent and when sailing now was dangerous
because the fast was now past Paul comforted them

2710 Saying to them Ye men I see that the voyage beginneth to be
with injury and much damage not only of the lading and ship but also
of our lives

2711 But the centurion believed the pilot and the master of the ship
more than those things which were said by Paul

2712 And whereas it was not a commodious haven to winter in the
greatest part gave counsel to sail thence if by any means they might
reach Phenice to winter there which is a haven of Crete looking
towards the southwest and northwest

2713 And the south wind gently blowing thinking that they had
obtained their purpose when they had loosed from Asson they sailed
close by Crete

2714 But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind
called Euroaquilo

2715 And when the ship was caught and could not bear up against the
wind giving up the ship to the winds we were driven

2716 And running under a certain island that is called Cauda we had
much work to come by the boat

2717 Which being taken up they used helps undergirding the ship
and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands they let down
the sail yard and so were driven

2718 And we being mightily tossed with the tempest the next day
they lightened the ship

2719 And the third day they cast out with their own hands the tacking
of the ship

2720 And when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and no
small storms lay on us all hope of our being saved was now taken away

2721 And after they had fasted a long time Paul standing forth in
the midst of them said You should indeed O ye men have hearkened
unto me and not have loosed from Crete and have gained this harm and
loss

2722 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer For there shall be no
loss of any mans life among you but only of the ship

2723 For an angel of God whose I am and whom I serve stood by me
this night

2724 Saying Fear not Paul thou must be brought before Caesar and
behold God hath given thee all them that sail with thee

2725 Wherefore sirs be of good cheer for I believe God that it
shall so be as it hath been told me

2726 And we must come unto a certain island

2727 But after the fourteenth night was come as we were sailing in
Adria about midnight the shipmen deemed that they discovered some
country

2728 Who also sounding found twenty fathoms and going on a little
further they found fifteen fathoms

2729 Then fearing lest we should fall upon rough places they cast
four anchors out of the stern and wished for the day

2730 But as the shipmen sought to fly out of the ship having let
down the boat into the sea under colour as though they would have
cast anchors out of the forepart of the ship

2731 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers Except these
stay in the ship you cannot be saved

2732 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat and let her fall
off

2733 And when it began to be light Paul besought them all to take
meat saying This day is the fourteenth day that you have waited and
continued fasting taking nothing

2734 Wherefore I pray you to take some meat for your healths sake
for there shall not an hair of the head of any of you perish

2735 And when he had said these things taking bread he gave thanks
to God in the sight of them all And when he had broken it he began to
eat

2736 Then were they all of better cheer and they also took some
meat

2737 And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and
sixteen souls

2738 And when they had eaten enough they lightened the ship casting
the wheat into the sea

2739 And when it was day they knew not the land But they discovered
a certain creek that had a shore into which they minded if they
could to thrust in the ship

2740 And when they had taken up the anchors they committed
themselves to the sea loosing withal the rudder bands And hoisting up
the mainsail to the wind they made towards shore

2741 And when we were fallen into a place where two seas met they
run the ship aground And the forepart indeed sticking fast remained
unmoveable but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the
sea

2742 And the soldiers counsel was that they should kill the
prisoners lest any of them swimming out should escape

2743 But the centurion willing to save Paul forbade it to be done
And he commanded that they who could swim should cast themselves first
into the sea and save themselves and get to land

2744 And the rest some they carried on boards and some on those
things that belonged to the ship And so it came to pass that every
soul got safe to land



Acts Chapter 28


Paul after three months stay in Melita continues his voyage and
arrives at Rome His conference there with the Jews

281 And when we had escaped then we knew that the island was called
Melita But the barbarians shewed us no small courtesy

282 For kindling a fire they refreshed us all because of the
present rain and of the cold

283 And when Paul had gathered together a bundle of sticks and had
laid them on the fire a viper coming out of the heat fastened on his
hand

284 And when the barbarians saw the beast hanging on his hand they
said one to another Undoubtedly this man is a murderer who though he
hath escaped the sea yet vengeance doth not suffer him to live

285 And he indeed shaking off the beast into the fire suffered no
harm

286 But they supposed that he would begin to swell up and that he
would suddenly fall down and die But expecting long and seeing that
there came no harm to him changing their minds they said that he was
a god

287 Now in these places were possessions of the chief man of the
island named Publius who receiving us for three days entertained us
courteously

288 And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever
and of a bloody flux To whom Paul entered in And when he had prayed
and laid his hands on him he healed him

289 Which being done all that had diseases in the island came and
were healed

2810 Who also honoured us with many honours and when we were to set
sail they laded us with such things as were necessary

2811 And after three months we sailed in a ship of Alexandria that
had wintered in the island whose sign was the Castors

2812 And when we were come to Syracusa we tarried there three days

2813 From thence compassing by the shore we came to Rhegium and
after one day the south wind blowing we came the second day to
Puteoli

2814 Where finding brethren we were desired to tarry with them
seven days And so we went to Rome

2815 And from thence when the brethren had heard of us they came to
meet us as far as Appii Forum and the Three Taverns Whom when Paul
saw he gave thanks to God and took courage

2816 And when we were come to Rome Paul was suffered to dwell by
himself with a soldier that kept him

2817 And after the third day he called together the chief of the
Jews And when they were assembled he said to them Men brethren I
having done nothing against the people or the custom of our fathers
was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans

2818 Who when they had examined me would have released me for that
there was no cause of death in me

2819 But the Jews contradicting it I was constrained to appeal unto
Caesar not that I had anything to accuse my nation of

2820 For this cause therefore I desired to see you and to speak to
you Because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain

2821 But they said to him We neither received letters concerning
thee from Judea neither did any of the brethren that came hither
relate or speak any evil of thee

2822 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest for as
concerning this sect we know that it is every where contradicted

2823 And when they had appointed him a day there came very many to
him unto his lodgings To whom he expounded testifying the kingdom of
God and persuading them concerning Jesus out of the law of Moses and
the prophets from morning until evening

2824 And some believed the things that were said but some believed
not

2825 And when they agreed not among themselves they departed Paul
speaking this one word Well did the Holy Ghost speak to our fathers by
Isaias the prophet

2826 Saying Go to this people and say to them With the ear you
shall hear and shall not understand and seeing you shall see and shall
not perceive

2827 For the heart of this people is grown gross and with their ears
have they heard heavily and their eyes they have shut lest perhaps
they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand
with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them

2828 Be it known therefore to you that this salvation of God is sent
to the Gentiles and they will hear it

2829 And when he had said these things the Jews went out from him
having much reasoning among themselves

2830 And he remained two whole years in his own hired lodging and he
received all that came in to him

2831 Preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things which
concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence without
prohibition




THE EPISTLE OF ST PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS



St Paul wrote this epistle at Corinth when he was preparing to go to
Jerusalem with the charitable contributions collected in Achaia and
Macedonia for the relief of the Christians in Judea which was about
twentyfour years after Our Lords Ascension It was written in Greek
but at the same time translated into Latin for the benefit of those
who did not understand that language And though it is not the first of
his Epistles in the order of time yet it is first placed on account of
sublimity of the matter contained in it of the preeminence of the
place to which it was sent and in veneration of the Church



Romans Chapter 1


He commends the faith of the Romans whom he longs to see The
philosophy of the heathens being void of faith and humility betrayed
them into shameful sins

11 Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle
separated unto the gospel of God

12 Which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy
scriptures

13 Concerning his Son who was made to him of the seed of David
according to the flesh

14 Who was predestinated the Son of God in power according to the
spirit of sanctification by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ
from the dead

Predestinated etc  Christ as man was predestinated to be the Son of
God and declared to be so as the apostle here signifies first by
power that is by his working stupendous miracles secondly by the
spirit of sanctification that is by his infinite sanctity thirdly
by his ressurection or raising himself from the dead

15 By whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to
the faith in all nations for his name

16 Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ

17 To all that are at Rome the beloved of God called to be saints
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus
Christ

18 First I give thanks to my God through Jesus Christ for you all
because your faith is spoken of in the whole world

19 For God is my witness whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of
his Son that without ceasing I make a commemoration of you

110 Always in my prayers making request if by any means now at
length I may have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come
unto you

111 For I long to see you that I may impart unto you some spiritual
grace to strengthen you

112 That is to say that I may be comforted together in you by that
which is common to us both your faith and mine

113 And I would not have you ignorant brethren that I have often
purposed to come unto you and have been hindered hitherto that I
might have some fruit among you also even as among other Gentiles

114 To the Greeks and to the barbarians to the wise and to the
unwise I am a debtor

115 So as much as is in me I am ready to preach the gospel to you
also that are at Rome

116 For I am not ashamed of the gospel For it is the power of God
unto salvation to every one that believeth to the Jew first and to the
Greek

117 For the justice of God is revealed therein from faith unto
faith as it is written The just man liveth by faith

118 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and injustice of those men that detain the truth of God in
injustice

119 Because that which is known of God is manifest in them For God
hath manifested it unto them

120 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world
are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made His
eternal power also and divinity so that they are inexcusable

121 Because that when they knew God they have not glorified him as
God or given thanks but became vain in their thoughts And their
foolish heart was darkened

122 For professing themselves to be wise they became fools

123 And they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the
likeness of the image of a corruptible man and of birds and of
fourfooted beasts and of creeping things

124 Wherefore God gave them up to the desires of their heart unto
uncleanness to dishonour their own bodies among themselves

125 Who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshipped and served
the creature rather than the Creator who is blessed for ever Amen

126 For this cause God delivered them up to shameful affections For
their women have changed the natural use into that use which is against
nature

God delivered them up  Not by being author of their sins but by
withdrawing his grace and so permitting them in punishment of their
pride to fall into those shameful sins

127 And in like manner the men also leaving the natural use of the
women have burned in their lusts one towards another men with men
working that which is filthy and receiving in themselves the recompense
which was due to their error

128 And as they liked not to have God in their knowledge God
delivered them up to a reprobate sense to do those things which are
not convenient

129 Being filled with all iniquity malice fornication avarice
wickedness full of envy murder contention deceit malignity
whisperers

130 Detractors hateful to God contumelious proud haughty
inventors of evil things disobedient to parents

131 Foolish dissolute without affection without fidelity without
mercy

132 Who having known the justice of God did not understand that
they who do such things are worthy of death and not only they that do
them but they also that consent to them that do them



Romans Chapter 2


The Jews are censured who make their boast of the law and keep it not
He declares who are the true Jews

21 Wherefore thou art inexcusable O man whosoever thou art that
judgest For wherein thou judgest another thou condemnest thyself For
thou dost the same things which thou judgest

22 For we know that the judgment of God is according to truth
against them that do such things

23 And thinkest thou this O man that judgest them who do such
things and dost the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of God

24 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and patience and
longsuffering Knowest thou not that the benignity of God leadeth thee
to penance

25 But according to thy hardness and impenitent heart thou
treasurest up to thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation
of the just judgment of God

26 Who will render to every man according to his works

27 To them indeed who according to patience in good work seek glory
and honour and incorruption eternal life

28 But to them that are contentious and who obey not the truth but
give credit to iniquity wrath and indignation

29 Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that worketh evil
of the Jew first and also of the Greek

210 But glory and honour and peace to every one that worketh good to
the Jew first and also to the Greek

211 For there is no respect of persons with God

212 For whosoever have sinned without the law shall perish without
the law and whosoever have sinned in the law shall be judged by the
law

213 For not the hearers of the law are just before God but the doers
of the law shall be justified

214 For when the Gentiles who have not the law do by nature those
things that are of the law these having not the law are a law to
themselves

215 Who shew the work of the law written in their hearts their
conscience bearing witness to them and their thoughts between
themselves accusing or also defending one another

216 In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus
Christ according to my gospel

217 But if thou art called a Jew and restest in the law and makest
thy boast of God

218 And knowest his will and approvest the more profitable things
being instructed by the law

219 Art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind a light
of them that are in darkness

220 An instructor of the foolish a teacher of infants having the
form of knowledge and of truth in the law

221 Thou therefore that teachest another teachest not thyself
thou that preachest that men should not steal stealest

222 Thou that sayest men should not commit adultery committest
adultery thou that abhorrest idols committest sacrilege

223 Thou that makest thy boast of the law by transgression of the
law dishonourest God

224 For the name of God through you is blasphemed among the
Gentiles as it is written

225 Circumcision profiteth indeed if thou keep the law but if thou
be a transgressor of the law thy circumcision is made uncircumcision

226 If then the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law shall
not this uncircumcision be counted for circumcision

227 And shall not that which by nature is uncircumcision if it
fulfil the law judge thee who by the letter and circumcision art a
transgressor of the law

228 For it is not he is a Jew who is so outwardly nor is that
circumcision which is outwardly in the flesh

229 But he is a Jew that is one inwardly and the circumcision is that
of the heart in the spirit not in the letter whose praise is not of
men but of God



Romans Chapter 3


The advantages of the Jews All men are sinners and none can be
justified by the works of the law but only by the grace of Christ

31 What advantage then hath the Jew or what is the profit of
circumcision

32 Much every way First indeed because the words of God were
committed to them

33 For what if some of them have not believed Shall their unbelief
make the faith of God without effect God forbid

34 But God is true and every man a liar as it is written That thou
mayest be justified in thy words and mayest overcome when thou art
judged

God only is essentially true All men in their own capacity are liable
to lies and errors nevertheless God who is the truth will make good
his promise of keeping his church in all truth See St John 1613

35 But if our injustice commend the justice of God what shall we
say Is God unjust who executeth wrath

36 I speak according to man God forbid Otherwise how shall God
judge this world

37 For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto
his glory why am I also yet judged as a sinner

38 And not rather as we are slandered and as some affirm that we
say let us do evil that there may come good Whose damnation is just

39 What then Do we excel them No not so For we have charged both
Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin

310 As it is written There is not any man just

There is not any man just viz  by virtue either of the law of
nature or of the law of Moses but only by faith and grace

311 There is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh
after God

312 All have turned out of the way they are become unprofitable
together there is none that doth good there is not so much as one

313 Their throat is an open sepulchre with their tongues they have
dealt deceitfully The venom of asps is under their lips

314 Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness

315 Their feet swift to shed blood

316 Destruction and misery in their ways

317 And the way of peace they have not known

318 There is no fear of God before their eyes

319 Now we know that what things soever the law speaketh it speaketh
to them that are in the law that every mouth may be stopped and all
the world may be made subject to God

320 Because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified
before him For by the law is the knowledge of sin

321 But now without the law the justice of God is made manifest
being witnessed by the law and the prophets

322 Even the justice of God by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and
upon all them that believe in him for there is no distinction

323 For all have sinned and do need the glory of God

324 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that
is in Christ Jesus

325 Whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation through faith in his
blood to the shewing of his justice for the remission of former sins

326 Through the forbearance of God for the shewing of his justice in
this time that he himself may be just and the justifier of him who is
of the faith of Jesus Christ

327 Where is then thy boasting It is excluded By what law Of
works No but by the law of faith

328 For we account a man to be justified by faith without the works
of the law

By faith etc  The faith to which the apostle here attributes mans
justification is not a presumptuous assurance of our being justified
but a firm and lively belief of all that God has revealed or promised
Heb 11 A faith working through charity in Jesus Christ Gal 56 In
short a faith which takes in hope love repentance and the use of
the sacraments And the works which he here excludes are only the
works of the law that is such as are done by the law of nature or
that of Moses antecedent to the faith of Christ but by no means such
as follow faith and proceed from it

329 Is he the God of the Jews only Is he not also of the Gentiles
yes of the Gentiles also

330 For it is one God that justifieth circumcision by faith and
uncircumcision through faith

331 Do we then destroy the law through faith God forbid But we
establish the law



Romans Chapter 4


Abraham was not justified by works done as of himself but by grace
and by faith And that before he was circumcised Gentiles by faith
are his children

41 What shall we say then that Abraham hath found who is our father
according to the flesh

42 For if Abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory
but not before God

By works  Done by his own strength without the grace of God and
faith in him Not before God  Whatever glory or applause such works
might procure from men they would be of no value in the sight of God

43 For what saith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was
reputed to him unto justice

Reputed etc  By God who reputeth nothing otherwise than it is
However we may gather from this word that when we are justified our
justification proceedeth from Gods free grace and bounty and not from
any efficacy which any act of ours could have of its own nature
abstracting from Gods grace

44 Now to him that worketh the reward is not reckoned according to
grace but according to debt

To him that worketh  Vis as of his own fund or by his own
strength Such a man says the apostle challenges his reward as a debt
due to his own performances whereas he who worketh not that is who
presumeth not upon any works done by his own strength but seeketh
justice through faith and grace is freely justified by Gods grace

45 But to him that worketh not yet believeth in him that justifieth
the ungodly his faith is reputed to justice according to the purpose
of the grace of God

46 As David also termeth the blessedness of a man to whom God
reputeth justice without works

47 Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are
covered

Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are
covered  That is blessed are those who by doing penance have
obtained pardon and remission of their sins and also are covered that
is newly clothed with the habit of grace and vested with the stole of
charity

48 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin

Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin  That is
blessed is the man who hath retained his baptismal innocence that no
grievous sin can be imputed to him And likewise blessed is the man
who after fall into sin hath done penance and leads a virtuous life
by frequenting the sacraments necessary for obtaining the grace to
prevent a relapse that sin is no more imputed to him

49 This blessedness then doth it remain in the circumcision only or
in the uncircumcision also For we say that unto Abraham faith was
reputed to justice

In the circumcision etc  That is is it only for the Jews that are
circumcised No says the apostle but also for the uncircumcised
Gentiles who by faith and grace may come to justice as Abraham did
before he was circumcised

410 How then was it reputed When he was in circumcision or in
uncircumcision Not in circumcision but in uncircumcision

411 And he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the justice
of the faith which he had being uncircumcised that he might be the
father of all them that believe being uncircumcised that unto them
also it may be reputed to justice

412 And he might be the father of circumcision not to them only that
are of the circumcision but to them also that follow the steps of the
faith that is in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham

413 For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his
seed that he should be heir of the world but through the justice of
faith

414 For if they who are of the law be heirs faith is made void the
promise is made of no effect

Be heirs  That is if they alone who follow the ceremonies of the
law be heirs of the blessings promised to Abraham then that faith
which was so much praised in him will be found to be of little value
And the very promise will be made void by which he was promised to be
the father not of the Jews only but of all nations of believers

415 For the law worketh wrath For where there is no law neither is
there transgression

The law worketh wrath  The law abstracting from faith and grace
worketh wrath occasionally by being an occasion of many
transgressions which provoke Gods wrath

416 Therefore is it of faith that according to grace the promise
might be firm to all the seed not to that only which is of the law
but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of
us all

417 As it is written I have made thee a father of many nations
before God whom he believed who quickeneth the dead and calleth those
things that are not as those that are

418 Who against hope believed in hope that he might be made the
father of many nations according to that which was said to him So
shall thy seed be

419 And he was not weak in faith Neither did he consider his own
body now dead whereas he was almost an hundred years old nor the
dead womb of Sara

420 In the promise also of God he staggered not by distrust but was
strengthened in faith giving glory to God

421 Most fully knowing that whatsoever he has promised he is able
also to perform

422 And therefore it was reputed to him unto justice

423 Now it is not written only for him that it was reputed to him
unto justice

424 But also for us to whom it shall be reputed if we believe in
him that raised up Jesus Christ our Lord from the dead

425 Who was delivered up for our sins and rose again for our
justification



Romans Chapter 5


The grounds we have for hope in Christ Sin and death came by Adam
grace and life by Christ

51 Being justified therefore by faith let us have peace with God
through our Lord Jesus Christ

52 By whom also we have access through faith into this grace wherein
we stand and glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of God

53 And not only so but we glory also in tribulation knowing that
tribulation worketh patience

54 And patience trial and trial hope

55 And hope confoundeth not because the charity of God is poured
forth in our hearts by the Holy Ghost who is given to us

56 For why did Christ when as yet we were weak according to the
time die for the ungodly

57 For scarce for a just man will one die yet perhaps for a good man
some one would dare to die

58 But God commendeth his charity towards us because when as yet we
were sinners according to the time

59 Christ died for us Much more therefore being now justified by
his blood shall we be saved from wrath through him

510 For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the
death of his Son much more being reconciled shall we be saved by his
life

511 And not only so but also we glory in God through our Lord Jesus
Christ by whom we have now received reconciliation

512 Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world and by sin
death and so death passed upon all men in whom all have sinned

By one man  Adam from whom we all contracted original sin

513 For until the law sin was in the world but sin was not imputed
when the law was not

Not imputed  That is men knew not or made no account of sin
neither was it imputed to them in the manner it was afterwards when
they transgressed the known written law of God

514 But death reigned from Adam unto Moses even over them also who
have not sinned after the similitude of the transgression of Adam who
is a figure of him who was to come

515 But not as the offence so also the gift For if by the offence
of one many died much more the grace of God and the gift by the
grace of one man Jesus Christ hath abounded unto many

516 And not as it was by one sin so also is the gift For judgment
indeed was by one unto condemnation but grace is of many offences unto
justification

517 For if by one mans offence death reigned through one much more
they who receive abundance of grace and of the gift and of justice
shall reign in life through one Jesus Christ

518 Therefore as by the offence of one unto all men to
condemnation so also by the justice of one unto all men to
justification of life

519 For as by the disobedience of one man many were made sinners so
also by the obedience of one many shall be made just

520 Now the law entered in that sin might abound And where sin
abounded grace did more abound

That sin might abound  Not as if the law were given on purpose for
sin to abound but that it so happened through mans perversity taking
occasion of sinning more from the prohibition of sin

521 That as sin hath reigned to death so also grace might reign by
justice unto life everlasting through Jesus Christ our Lord



Romans Chapter 6


The Christian must die to sin and live to God

61 What shall we say then Shall we continue in sin that grace may
abound

62 God forbid For we that are dead to sin how shall we live any
longer therein

63 Know you not that all we who are baptized in Christ Jesus are
baptized in his death

64 For we are buried together with him by baptism into death that
as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father so we also
may walk in newness of life

65 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death
we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection

66 Knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the
body of sin may be destroyed to the end that we may serve sin no
longer

Old manbody of sin  Our corrupt state subject to sin and
concupiscence coming to us from Adam is called our old man as our
state reformed in and by Christ is called the new man And the vices
and sins which then ruled in us are named the body of sin

67 For he that is dead is justified from sin

68 Now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall live also
together with Christ

69 Knowing that Christ rising again from the dead dieth now no
more Death shall no more have dominion over him

610 For in that he died to sin he died once but in that he liveth
he liveth unto God

611 So do you also reckon that you are dead to sin but alive unto
God in Christ Jesus our Lord

612 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body so as to obey
the lusts thereof

613 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of iniquity unto
sin but present yourselves to God as those that are alive from the
dead and your members as instruments of justice unto God

614 For sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under
the law but under grace

615 What then Shall we sin because we are not under the law but
under grace God forbid

616 Know you not that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey
his servants you are whom you obey whether it be of sin unto death or
of obedience unto justice

617 But thanks be to God that you were the servants of sin but have
obeyed from the heart unto that form of doctrine into which you have
been delivered

618 Being then freed from sin we have been made servants of justice

619 I speak an human thing because of the infirmity of your flesh
For as you have yielded your members to serve uncleanness and iniquity
unto iniquity so now yield your members to serve justice unto
sanctification

620 For when you were the servants of sin you were free men to
justice

621 What fruit therefore had you then in those things of which you
are now ashamed For the end of them is death

622 But now being made free from sin and become servants to God you
have your fruit unto sanctification and the end life everlasting

623 For the wages of sin is death But the grace of God life
everlasting in Christ Jesus our Lord



Romans Chapter 7


We are released by Christ from the law and from the guilt of sin
though the inclination to it still tempts us

71 Know you not brethren for I speak to them that know the law
that the law hath dominion over a man as long as it liveth

As long as it liveth  or as long as he liveth

72 For the woman that hath an husband whilst her husband liveth is
bound to the law But if her husband be dead she is loosed from the
law of her husband

73 Therefore whilst her husband liveth she shall be called an
adulteress if she be with another man but if her husband be dead she
is delivered from the law of her husband so that she is not an
adulteress if she be with another man

74 Therefore my brethren you also are become dead to the law by
the body of Christ that you may belong to another who is risen again
from the dead that we may bring forth fruit to God

75 For when we were in the flesh the passions of sins which were by
the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death

76 But now we are loosed from the law of death wherein we were
detained so that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the
oldness of the letter

77 What shall we say then Is the law sin God forbid But I do not
know sin but by the law For I had not known concupiscence if the law
did not say Thou shalt not covet

78 But sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all
manner of concupiscence For without the law sin was dead

Sin taking occasion  Sin or concupiscence which is called sin
because it is from sin and leads to sin which was asleep before was
weakened by the prohibition the law not being the cause thereof nor
properly giving occasion to it but occasion being taken by our corrupt
nature to resist the commandment laid upon us

79 And I lived some time without the law But when the commandment
came sin revived

710 And I died And the commandment that was ordained to life the
same was found to be unto death to me

711 For sin taking occasion by the commandment seduced me and by
it killed me

712 Wherefore the law indeed is holy and the commandment holy and
just and good

713 Was that then which is good made death unto me God forbid But
sin that it may appear sin by that which is good wrought death in
me that sin by the commandment might become sinful above measure

That it may appear sin or that sin may appear viz  To be the
monster it is which is even capable to take occasion from that which
is good to work death

714 For we know that the law is spiritual But I am carnal sold
under sin

715 For that which I work I understand not For I do not that good
which I will but the evil which I hate that I do

I do not that good which I will etc  The apostle here describes the
disorderly motions of passion and concupiscence which oftentimes in us
get the start of reason and by means of which even good men suffer in
the inferior appetite what their will abhors and are much hindered in
the accomplishment of the desires of their spirit and mind But these
evil motions though they are called the law of sin because they come
from original sin and violently tempt and incline to sin as long as
the will does not consent to them are not sins because they are not
voluntary

716 If then I do that which I will not I consent to the law that it
is good

717 Now then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me

718 For I know that there dwelleth not in me that is to say in my
flesh that which is good For to will is present with me but to
accomplish that which is good I find not

719 For the good which I will I do not but the evil which I will
not that I do

720 Now if I do that which I will not it is no more I that do it
but sin that dwelleth in me

721 I find then a law that when I have a will to do good evil is
present with me

722 For I am delighted with the law of God according to the inward
man

723 But I see another law in my members fighting against the law of
my mind and captivating me in the law of sin that is in my members

724 Unhappy man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this
death

725 The grace of God by Jesus Christ our Lord Therefore I myself
with the mind serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin



Romans Chapter 8


There is no condemnation to them that being justified by Christ walk
not according to the flesh but according to the spirit Their strong
hope and love of God

81 There is now therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ
Jesus who walk not according to the flesh

82 For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath delivered
me from the law of sin and of death

83 For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the
flesh God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and of
sin hath condemned sin in the flesh

84 That the justification of the law might be fulfilled in us who
walk not according to the flesh but according to the spirit

85 For they that are according to the flesh mind the things that are
of the flesh but they that are according to the spirit mind the things
that are of the spirit

86 For the wisdom of the flesh is death but the wisdom of the spirit
is life and peace

87 Because the wisdom of the flesh is an enemy to God For it is not
subject to the law of God neither can it be

88 And they who are in the flesh cannot please God

89 But you are not in the flesh but the spirit if so be that the
Spirit of God dwell in you Now if any man have not the Spirit of
Christ he is none of his

810 And if Christ be in you the body indeed is dead because of sin
but the spirit liveth because of justification

811 And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
in you he that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead shall quicken
also your mortal bodies because of his Spirit that dwelleth in you

812 Therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live
according to the flesh

813 For if you live according to the flesh you shall die but if by
the Spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh you shall live

814 For whosoever are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of
God

815 For you have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear
but you have received the spirit of adoption of sons whereby we cry
Abba Father

816 For the Spirit himself giveth testimony to our spirit that we are
the sons of God

The Spirit himself etc  By the inward motions of divine love and
the peace of conscience which the children of God experience they
have a kind of testimony of Gods favour by which they are much
strengthened in their hope of their justification and salvation but
yet not so as to pretend to an absolute assurance which is not usually
granted in this mortal life during which we are taught to work out our
salvation with fear and trembling Phil 212 And that he that
thinketh himself to stand must take heed lest he fall 1 Cor 1012
See also Rom 1120 21 22

817 And if sons heirs also heirs indeed of God and joint heirs with
Christ yet so if we suffer with him that we may be also glorified
with him

818 For I reckon that the sufferings of this time are not worthy to
be compared with the glory to come that shall be revealed in us

819 For the expectation of the creature waiteth for the revelation of
the sons of God

The expectation of the creature etc  He speaks of the corporeal
creation made for the use and service of man and by occasion of his
sin made subject to vanity that is to a perpetual instability
tending to corruption and other defects so that by a figure of speech
it is here said to groan and be in labour and to long for its
deliverance which is then to come when sin shall reign no more and
God shall raise the bodies and unite them to their souls never more to
separate and to be in everlasting happiness in heaven

820 For the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but
by reason of him that made it subject in hope

821 Because the creature also itself shall be delivered from the
servitude of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children
of God

822 For we know that every creature groaneth and travaileth in pain
even till now

823 And not only it but ourselves also who have the firstfruits of
the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the
adoption of the sons of God the redemption of our body

824 For we are saved by hope But hope that is seen is not hope For
what a man seeth why doth he hope for

825 But if we hope for that which we see not we wait for it with
patience

826 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity For we know not
what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit himself asketh for
us with unspeakable groanings

Asketh for us  The Spirit is said to ask and desire for the saints
and to pray in us inasmuch as he inspireth prayer and teacheth us to
pray

827 And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what the Spirit
desireth because he asketh for the saints according to God

828 And we know that to them that love God all things work together
unto good to such as according to his purpose are called to be
saints

829 For whom he foreknew he also predestinated to be made
conformable to the image of his Son that he might be the Firstborn
amongst many brethren

He also predestinated etc  That is God hath preordained that all
his elect should be conformable to the image of his Son We must not
here offer to pry into the secrets of Gods eternal election only
firmly believe that all our good in time and eternity flows
originally from Gods free goodness and all our evil from mans free
will

830 And whom he predestinated them he also called And whom he
called them he also justified And whom he justified them he also
glorified

831 What shall we then say to these things If God be for us who is
against us

832 He that spared not even his own Son but delivered him up for us
all how hath he not also with him given us all things

833 Who shall accuse against the elect of God God is he that
justifieth

834 Who is he that shall condemn Christ Jesus that died yea that is
risen also again who is at the right hand of God who also maketh
intercession for us

835 Who then shall separate us from the love of Christ Shall
tribulation Or distress Or famine Or nakedness Or danger Or
persecution Or the sword

836 As it is written For thy sake we are put to death all the day
long We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter

837 But in all these things we overcome because of him that hath
loved us

838 For I am sure that neither death nor life nor angels nor
principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor
might

I am sure  That is I am persuaded as it is in the Greek pepeismai

839 Nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to
separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord



Romans Chapter 9


The apostles concern for the Jews Gods election is free and not
confined to their nation

91 I speak the truth in Christ I lie not my conscience bearing me
witness in the Holy Ghost

92 That I have great sadness and continual sorrow in my heart

93 For I wished myself to be an anathema from Christ for my
brethren who are my kinsmen according to the flesh

Anathema  A curse The apostles concern and love for his countrymen
the Jews was so great that he was willing to suffer even an anathema
or curse for their sake or any evil that could come upon him without
his offending God

94 Who are Israelites to whom belongeth the adoption as of children
and the glory and the testament and the giving of the law and the
service of God and the promises

95 Whose are the fathers and of whom is Christ according to the
flesh who is over all things God blessed for ever Amen

96 Not as though the word of God hath miscarried For all are not
Israelites that are of Israel

All are not Israelites etc  Not all who are the carnal seed of
Israel are true Israelites in Gods account who as by his free
grace he heretofore preferred Isaac before Ismael and Jacob before
Esau so he could and did by the like free grace election and mercy
raise up spiritual children by faith to Abraham and Israel from among
the Gentiles and prefer them before the carnal Jews

97 Neither are all they that are the seed of Abraham children but
in Isaac shall thy seed be called

98 That is to say not they that are the children of the flesh are
the children of God but they that are the children of the promise are
accounted for the seed

99 For this is the word of promise According to this time will I
come And Sara shall have a son

910 And not only she But when Rebecca also had conceived at once of
Isaac our father

911 For when the children were not yet born nor had done any good or
evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand

Not yet born etc  By this example of these twins and the preference
of the younger to the elder the drift of the apostle is to shew that
God in his election mercy and grace is not tied to any particular
nation as the Jews imagined nor to any prerogative of birth or any
forgoing merits For as antecedently to his grace he sees no merits
in any but finds all involved in sin in the common mass of
condemnation and all children of wrath there is no one whom he might
not justly leave in that mass so that whomsoever he delivers from it
he delivers in his mercy and whomsoever he leaves in it he leaves in
his justice As when of two equally criminal the king is pleased out
of pure mercy to pardon one whilst he suffers justice to take place in
the execution of the other

912 Not of works but of him that calleth it was said to her The
elder shall serve the younger

913 As it is written Jacob I have loved but Esau I have hated

914 What shall we say then Is there injustice with God God forbid

915 For he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have
mercy And I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy

916 So then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth
but of God that sheweth mercy

Not of him that willeth etc  That is by any power or strength of
his own abstracting from the grace of God

917 For the scripture saith to Pharao To this purpose have I raised
thee that I may shew my power in thee and that my name may be declared
throughout all the earth

To this purpose etc  Not that God made him on purpose that he should
sin and so be damned but foreseeing his obstinacy in sin and the
abuse of his own free will he raised him up to be a mighty king to
make a more remarkable example of him and that his power might be
better known and his justice in punishing him published throughout
the earth

918 Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will And whom he will he
hardeneth

He hardeneth  Not by being the cause or author of his sin but by
withholding his grace and so leaving him in his sin in punishment of
his past demerits

919 Thou wilt say therefore to me Why doth he then find fault For
who resisteth his will

920 O man who art thou that repliest against God Shall the thing
formed say to him that formed it Why hast thou made me thus

921 Or hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to
make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour

The potter  This similitude is used only to shew that we are not to
dispute with our Maker nor to reason with him why he does not give as
much grace to one as to another for since the whole lump of our clay
is vitiated by sin it is owing to his goodness and mercy that he
makes out of it so many vessels of honor and it is no more than just
that others in punishment of their unrepented sins should be given up
to be vessels of dishonor

922 What if God willing to shew his wrath and to make his power
known endured with much patience vessels of wrath fitted for
destruction

923 That he might shew the riches of his glory on the vessels of
mercy which he hath prepared unto glory

924 Even us whom also he hath called not only of the Jews but also
of the Gentiles

925 As in Osee he saith I will call that which was not my people my
people and her that was not beloved beloved and her that had not
obtained mercy one that hath obtained mercy

926 And it shalt be in the place where it was said unto them you are
not my people there they shall be called the sons of the living God

927 And Isaias cried out concerning Israel If the number of the
children of Israel be as the sand of the sea a remnant shall be saved

A remnant  That is a small number only of the children of Israel
shall be converted and saved How perversely is this text quoted for
the salvation of men of all religions when it speaks only of the
converts of the children of Israel

928 For he shall finish his word and cut it short in justice because
a short word shall the Lord make upon the earth

929 And Isaias foretold Unless the Lord of Sabbath had left us a
seed we had been made as Sodom and we had been like unto Gomorrha

930 What then shall we say That the Gentiles who followed not after
justice have attained to justice even the justice that is of faith

931 But Israel by following after the law of justice is not come
unto the law of justice

932 Why so Because they sought it not by faith but as it were of
works For they stumbled at the stumblingstone

933 As it is written Behold I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and a
rock of scandal And whosoever believeth in him shall not be
confounded



Romans Chapter 10


The end of the law is faith in Christ which the Jews refusing to
submit to cannot be justified

101 Brethren the will of my heart indeed and my prayer to God is
for them unto salvation

102 For I bear them witness that they have a zeal of God but not
according to knowledge

103 For they not knowing the justice of God and seeking to establish
their own have not submitted themselves to the justice of God

The justice of God  That is the justice which God giveth us through
Christ as on the other hand the Jews own justice is that which they
pretended to by their own strength or by the observance of the law
without faith in Christ

104 For the end of the law is Christ unto justice to everyone that
believeth

105 For Moses wrote that the justice which is of the law The man
that shall do it shall live by it

106 But the justice which is of faith speaketh thus Say not in thy
heart Who shall ascend into heaven That is to bring Christ down

107 Or who shall descend into the deep That is to bring up Christ
again from the dead

108 But what saith the scripture The word is nigh thee even in thy
mouth and in thy heart This is the word of faith which we preach

109 For if thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in
thy heart that God hath raised him up from the dead thou shalt be
saved

Thou shalt be saved  To confess the Lord Jesus and to call upon the
name of the Lord ver 13 is not barely the professing a belief in the
person of Christ but moreover implies a belief of his whole doctrine
and an obedience to his law without which the calling him Lord will
save no man St Matt 721

1010 For with the heart we believe unto justice but with the
mouth confession is made unto salvation

1011 For the scripture saith Whosoever believeth in him shall not be
confounded

1012 For there is no distinction of the Jew and the Greek for the
same is Lord over all rich unto all that call upon him

1013 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
saved

1014 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed
Or how shall they believe him of whom they have not heard And how
shall they hear without a preacher

1015 And how shall they preach unless they be sent as it is written
How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace of
them that bring glad tidings of good things

Unless they be sent  Here is an evident proof against all new
teachers who have all usurped to themselves the ministry without any
lawful mission derived by succession from the apostles to whom Christ
said John 2021 As my Father hath sent me I also send you

1016 But all do not obey the gospel For Isaias saith Lord who hath
believed our report

1017 Faith then cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of Christ

1018 But I say Have they not heard Yes verily Their sound hath
gone forth into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the
whole world

1019 But I say Hath not Israel known First Moses saith I will
provoke you to jealousy by that which is not a nation by a foolish
nation I will anger you

1020 But Isaias is bold and saith I was found by them that did not
seek me I appeared openly to them that asked not after me

1021 But to Israel he saith All the day long have I spread my hands
to a people that believeth not and contradicteth me



Romans Chapter 11


God hath not cast off all Israel The Gentiles must not be proud but
stand in faith and fear

111 I say then Hath God cast away his people God forbid For I
also am an Israelite of the seed of Abraham of the tribe of Benjamin

112 God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew Know you not
what the scripture saith of Elias how he calleth on God against
Israel

113 Lord they have slain thy prophets they have dug down thy
altars And I am left alone and they seek my life

114 But what saith the divine answer to him I have left me seven
thousand men that have not bowed their knees to Baal

Seven thousand etc  This is very ill alleged by some against the
perpetual visibility of the church of Christ the more because however
the number of the faithful might be abridged by the persecution of
Jezabel in the kingdom of the ten tribes the church was at the same
time in a most flourishing condition under Asa and Josaphat in the
kingdom of Judah

115 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant saved
according to the election of grace

116 And if by grace it is not now by works otherwise grace is no
more grace

It is not now by works etc  If salvation were to come by works done
by nature without faith and grace salvation would not be a grace or
favour but a debt but such dead works are indeed of no value in the
sight of God towards salvation It is not the same with regard to works
done with and by Gods grace for to such works as these he has
promised eternal salvation

117 What then That which Israel sought he hath not obtained but
the election hath obtained it And the rest have been blinded

118 As it is written God hath given them the spirit of
insensibility eyes that they should not see and ears that they should
not hear until this present day

God hath given them etc  Not by his working or acting in them but
by his permission and by withdrawing his grace in punishment of their
obstinacy

119 And David saith Let their table be made a snare and a trap and a
stumbling block and a recompense unto them

1110 Let their eyes be darkened that they may not see and bow down
their back always

1111 I say then Have they so stumbled that they should fall God
forbid But by their offence salvation is come to the Gentiles that
they may be emulous of them

That they should fall  The nation of the Jews is not absolutely and
without remedy cast off for ever but in part only many thousands of
them having been at first converted and for a time which fall of
theirs God has been pleased to turn to the good of the Gentiles

1112 Now if the offence of them be the riches of the world and the
diminution of them the riches of the Gentiles how much more the
fulness of them

1113 For I say to you Gentiles As long indeed as I am the apostle
of the Gentiles I will honour my ministry

1114 If by any means I may provoke to emulation them who are my
flesh and may save some of them

1115 For if the loss of them be the reconciliation of the world what
shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead

1116 For if the firstfruit be holy so is the lump also and if the
root be holy so are the branches

1117 And if some of the branches be broken and thou being a wild
olive art ingrafted in them and art made partaker of the root and of
the fatness of the olive tree

1118 Boast not against the branches But if thou boast thou bearest
not the root but the root thee

1119 Thou wilt say then The branches were broken off that I might be
grafted in

1120 Well because of unbelief they were broken off But thou
standest by faith Be not highminded but fear

Thou standest by faith be not highminded but fear  We see here that
he who standeth by faith may fall from it and therefore must live in
fear and not in the vain presumption and security of modern sectaries

1121 For if God hath not spared the natural branches fear lest
perhaps also he spare not thee

1122 See then the goodness and the severity of God towards them
indeed that are fallen the severity but towards thee the goodness of
God if thou abide in goodness Otherwise thou also shalt be cut off

Otherwise thou also shalt be cut off  The Gentiles are here
admonished not to be proud nor to glory against the Jews but to take
occasion rather from their fall to fear and to be humble lest they be
cast off Not that the whole church of Christ can ever fall from him
having been secured by so many divine promises in holy writ but that
each one in particular may fall and therefore all in general are to be
admonished to beware of that which may happen to any one in
particular

1123 And they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be
grafted in for God is able to graft them in again

1124 For if thou were cut out of the wild olive tree which is
natural to thee and contrary to nature wert grafted into the good
olive tree how much more shall they that are the natural branches be
grafted into their own olive tree

1125 For I would not have you ignorant brethren of this mystery
lest you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part
has happened in Israel until the fulness of the Gentiles should come
in

1126 And so all Israel should be saved as it is written There shall
come out of Sion he that shall deliver and shall turn away ungodliness
from Jacob

1127 And this is to them my covenant when I shall take away their
sins

1128 As concerning the gospel indeed they are enemies for your
sake but as touching the election they are most dear for the sake of
the fathers

1129 For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance

For the gifts and the calling of God are without  his repenting
himself of them for the promises of God are unchangeable nor can he
repent of conferring his gifts

1130 For as you also in times past did not believe God but now have
obtained mercy through their unbelief

1131 So these also now have not believed for your mercy that they
also may obtain mercy

1132 For God hath concluded all in unbelief that he may have mercy
on all

Concluded all in unbelief  He hath found all nations both Jews and
Gentiles in unbelief and sin not by his causing but by the abuse of
their own free will so that their calling and election is purely owing
to his mercy

1133 O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of
God How incomprehensible are his judgments and how unsearchable his
ways

1134 For who hath known the mind of the Lord Or who hath been his
counsellor

1135 Or who hath first given to him and recompense shall be made
him

1136 For of him and by him and in him are all things to him be
glory for ever Amen



Romans Chapter 12


Lessons of Christian virtues

121 I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercy of God that you
present your bodies a living sacrifice holy pleasing unto God your
reasonable service

122 And be not conformed to this world but be reformed in the
newness of your mind that you may prove what is the good and the
acceptable and the perfect will of God

123 For I say by the grace that is given me to all that are among
you not to be more wise than it behoveth to be wise but to be wise
unto sobriety and according as God hath divided to every one the
measure of faith

124 For as in one body we have many members but all the members have
not the same office

125 So we being many are one body in Christ and every one members
one of another

126 And having different gifts according to the grace that is given
us either prophecy to be used according to the rule of faith

127 Or ministry in ministering or he that teacheth in doctrine

128 He that exhorteth in exhorting he that giveth with simplicity
he that ruleth with carefulness he that sheweth mercy with
cheerfulness

129 Let love be without dissimulation Hating that which is evil
cleaving to that which is good

1210 Loving one another with the charity of brotherhood with honour
preventing one another

1211 In carefulness not slothful In spirit fervent Serving the
Lord

1212 Rejoicing in hope Patient in tribulation Instant in prayer

1213 Communicating to the necessities of the saints Pursuing
hospitality

1214 Bless them that persecute you bless and curse not

1215 Rejoice with them that rejoice weep with them that weep

1216 Being of one mind one towards another Not minding high things
but consenting to the humble Be not wise in your own conceits

1217 To no man rendering evil for evil Providing good things not
only in the sight of God but also in the sight of all men

1218 If it be possible as much as is in you have peace with all
men

1219 Revenge not yourselves my dearly beloved but give place unto
wrath for it is written Revenge is mine I will repay saith the
Lord

1220 But if the enemy be hungry give him to eat if he thirst give
him to drink For doing this thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his
head

1221 Be not overcome by evil but overcome evil by good



Romans Chapter 13


Lessons of obedience to superiors and mutual charity

131 Let every soul be subject to higher powers For there is no power
but from God and those that are ordained of God

132 Therefore he that resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of
God And they that resist purchase to themselves damnation

133 For princes are not a terror to the good work but to the evil
Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power Do that which is good and
thou shalt have praise from the same

134 For he is Gods minister to thee for good But if thou do that
which is evil fear for he beareth not the sword in vain For he is
Gods minister an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil

135 Wherefore be subject of necessity not only for wrath but also
for conscience sake

136 For therefore also you pay tribute For they are the ministers of
God serving unto this purpose

137 Render therefore to all men their dues Tribute to whom tribute
is due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honour to whom
honour

138 Owe no man any thing but to love one another For he that loveth
his neighbour hath fulfilled the law

139 For Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not kill Thou
shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou shalt not
covet And if there be any other commandment it is comprised in this
word Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself

1310 The love of our neighbour worketh no evil Love therefore is the
fulfilling of the law

1311 And that knowing the season that it is now the hour for us to
rise from sleep For now our salvation is nearer than when we believed

1312 The night is passed And the day is at hand Let us therefore
cast off the works of darkness and put on the armour of light

1313 Let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and
drunkenness not in chambering and impurities not in contention and
envy

1314 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for
the flesh in its concupiscences



Romans Chapter 14


The strong must bear with the weak Cautions against judging and giving
scandal

141 Now him that is weak in faith take unto you not in disputes
about thoughts

142 For one believeth that he may eat all things but he that is
weak let him eat herbs

Eat all things  Viz without observing the distinction of clean and
unclean meats prescribed by the law of Moses which was now no longer
obligatory Some weak Christians converted from among the Jews as we
here gather from the apostle made a scruple of eating such meats as
were deemed unclean by the law such as swines flesh etc which the
stronger sort of Christians did eat without scruple Now the apostle
to reconcile them together exhorts the former not to judge or condemn
the latter using their Christian liberty and the latter to take care
not to despise or scandalize their weaker brethren either by bringing
them to eat what in their conscience they think they should not or by
giving them such offence as to endanger the driving them thereby from
the Christian religion

143 Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not and he that
eateth not let him not judge him that eateth For God hath taken him
to him

144 Who art thou that judgest another mans servant To his own lord
he standeth or falleth And he shall stand for God is able to make him
stand

145 For one judgeth between day and day and another judgeth every
day Let every man abound in his own sense

Between day etc  Still observing the sabbaths and festivals of the
law

146 He that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the Lord And he that
eateth eateth to the Lord for he giveth thanks to God And he that
eateth not to the Lord he eateth not and giveth thanks to God

147 For none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself

148 For whether we live we live unto the Lord or whether we die we
die unto the Lord Therefore whether we live or whether we die we are
the Lords

149 For to this end Christ died and rose again that he might be Lord
both of the dead and of the living

1410 But thou why judgest thou thy brother Or thou why dost thou
despise thy brother For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of
Christ

1411 For it is written As I live saith the Lord every knee shall
bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God

1412 Therefore every one of us shall render account to God for
himself

1413 Let us not therefore judge one another any more But judge this
rather that you put not a stumblingblock or a scandal in your
brothers way

1414 I know and am confident in the Lord Jesus that nothing is
unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean
to him it is unclean

1415 For if because of thy meat thy brother be grieved thou
walkest not now according to charity Destroy not him with thy meat
for whom Christ died

1416 Let not then our good be evil spoken of

1417 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink but justice and
peace and joy in the Holy Ghost

1418 For he that in this serveth Christ pleaseth God and is approved
of men

1419 Therefore let us follow after the things that are of peace and
keep the things that are of edification one towards another

1420 Destroy not the work of God for meat All things indeed are
clean but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence

1421 It is good not to eat flesh and not to drink wine nor any thing
whereby thy brother is offended or scandalized or made weak

1422 Hast thou faith Have it to thyself before God Blessed is he
that condemneth not himself in that which he alloweth

1423 But he that discerneth if he eat is condemned because not of
faith For all that is not of faith is sin

Discerneth  That is distinguisheth between meats and eateth against
his conscience what he deems unclean Of faith  By faith is here
understood judgment and conscience to act against which is always a
sin



Romans Chapter 15


He exhorts them to be all of one mind and promises to come and see
them

151 Now we that are stronger ought to bear the infirmities of the
weak and not to please ourselves

152 Let every one of you Please his neighbour unto good to
edification

153 For Christ did not please himself but as it is written The
reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me

154 For what things soever were written were written for our
learning that through patience and the comfort of the scriptures we
might have hope

155 Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of one
mind one towards another according to Jesus Christ

156 That with one mind and with one mouth you may glorify God and the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ

157 Wherefore receive one another as Christ also hath received you
unto the honour of God

158 For I say that Christ Jesus was minister of the circumcision for
the truth of God to confirm the promises made unto the fathers

Minister of the circumcision  That is executed his office and
ministry towards the Jews the people of the circumcision

159 But that the Gentiles are to glorify God for his mercy as it is
written Therefore will I confess to thee O Lord among the Gentiles
and will sing to thy name

1510 And again he saith rejoice ye Gentiles with his people

1511 And again praise the Lord all ye Gentiles and magnify him
all ye people

1512 And again Isaias saith There shall be a root of Jesse and he
that shall rise up to rule the Gentiles in him the Gentiles shall
hope

1513 Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in
believing that you may abound in hope and in the power of the Holy
Ghost

1514 And I myself also my brethren am assured of you that you also
are full of love replenished with all knowledge so that you are able
to admonish one another

1515 But I have written to you brethren more boldly in some sort
as it were putting you in mind because of the grace which is given me
from God

1516 That I should be the minister of Christ Jesus among the
Gentiles sanctifying the gospel of God that the oblation of the
Gentiles may be made acceptable and sanctified in the Holy Ghost

1517 I have therefore glory in Christ Jesus towards God

1518 For I dare not to speak of any of those things which Christ
worketh not by me for the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed

1519 By the virtue of signs and wonders in the power of the Holy
Ghost so that from Jerusalem round about as far as unto Illyricum I
have replenished the gospel of Christ

1520 And I have so preached this gospel not where Christ was named
lest I should build upon another man a foundation

1521 But as it is written They to whom he was not spoken of shall
see and they that have not heard shall understand

1522 For which cause also I was hindered very much from coming to
you and have been kept away till now

1523 But now having no more place in these countries and having a
great desire these many years past to come unto you

1524 When I shall begin to take my journey into Spain I hope that
as I pass I shall see you and be brought on my way thither by you if
first in part I shall have enjoyed you

1525 But now I shall go to Jerusalem to minister unto the saints

1526 For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a
contribution for the poor of the saints that are in Jerusalem

1527 For it hath pleased them and they are their debtors For if
the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things they
ought also in carnal things to minister to them

1528 When therefore I shall have accomplished this and consigned to
them this fruit I will come by you into Spain

1529 And I know that when I come to you I shall come in the abundance
of the blessing of the gospel of Christ

1530 I beseech you therefore brethren through our Lord Jesus Christ
and by the charity of the Holy Ghost that you help me in your prayers
for me to God

1531 That I may be delivered from the unbelievers that are in Judea
and that the oblation of my service may be acceptable in Jerusalem to
the saints

1532 That I may come to you with joy by the will of God and may be
refreshed with you

1533 Now the God of peace be with you all Amen



Romans Chapter 16


He concludes with salutations bidding them beware of all that should
oppose the doctrine they had learned

161 And I commend to you Phebe our sister who is in the ministry of
the church that is in Cenchrae

162 That you receive her in the Lord as becometh saints and that you
assist her in whatsoever business she shall have need of you For she
also hath assisted many and myself also

163 Salute Prisca and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus

164 Who have for my life laid down their own necks to whom not I
only give thanks but also all the churches of the Gentiles

165 And the church which is in their house Salute Epenetus my
beloved who is the firstfruits of Asia in Christ

166 Salute Mary who hath laboured much among you

167 Salute Andronicus and Junias my kinsmen and fellow prisoners
who are of note among the apostles who also were in Christ before me

168 Salute Ampliatus most beloved to me in the Lord

169 Salute Urbanus our helper in Christ Jesus and Stachys my
beloved

1610 Salute Apellas approved in Christ

1611 Salute them that are of Aristobulus household Salute Herodian
my kinsman Salute them that are of Narcissus household who are in
the Lord

1612 Salute Tryphaena and Tryphosa who labour in the Lord Salute
Persis the dearly beloved who hath much laboured in the Lord

1613 Salute Rufus elect in the Lord and his mother and mine

1614 Salute Asyncritus Phlegon Hermas Patrobas Hermes and the
brethren that are with them

1615 Salute Philologus and Julia Nereus and his sister and
Olympias and all the saints that are with them

1616 Salute one another with an holy kiss All the churches of Christ
salute you

1617 Now I beseech you brethren to mark them who make dissensions
and offences contrary to the doctrine which you have learned and avoid
them

1618 For they that are such serve not Christ our Lord but their own
belly and by pleasing speeches and good words seduce the hearts of the
innocent

1619 For your obedience is published in every place I rejoice
therefore in you But I would have you to be wise in good and simple in
evil

1620 And the God of peace crush Satan under your feet speedily The
grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you

1621 Timothy my fellow labourer saluteth you and Lucius and Jason
and Sosipater my kinsmen

1622 I Tertius who wrote this epistle salute you in the Lord

1623 Caius my host and the whole church saluteth you Erastus the
treasurer of the city saluteth you and Quartus a brother

1624 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all Amen

1625 Now to him that is able to establish you according to my gospel
and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the
mystery which was kept secret from eternity

1626 Which now is made manifest by the scriptures of the prophets
according to the precept of the eternal God for the obedience of
faith known among all nations

1627 To God the only wise through Jesus Christ to whom be honour
and glory for ever and ever Amen




THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS



St Paul having planted the faithful in Corinth where he had preached
a year and a half and converted a great many went to Ephesus After
being there three years he wrote this first Epistle to the Corinthians
and sent it by the same persons Stephanus Fortunatus and Achaicus
who had brought their letter to him It was written about twentyfour
years after our Lords Ascension and contains several matters
appertaining to faith and morals and also to ecclesiastical discipline



1 Corinthians Chapter 1


He reproveth their dissensions about their teachers The world was to
be saved by preaching of the cross and not by human wisdom or
eloquence

11 Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God
and Sosthenes a brother

12 To the church of God that is at Corinth to them that are
sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be saints with all that invoke
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place of theirs and ours

13 Grace to you and peace from God our father and from the Lord
Jesus Christ

14 I give thanks to my God always for you for the grace of God that
is given you in Christ Jesus

15 That in all things you are made rich in him in all utterance and
in all knowledge

16 As the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you

17 So that nothing is wanting to you in any grace waiting for the
manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ

18 Who also will confirm you unto the end without crime in the days
of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ

19 God is faithful by whom you are called unto the fellowship of his
Son Jesus Christ our Lord

110 Now I beseech you brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ that you all speak the same thing and that there be no schisms
among you but that you be perfect in the same mind and in the same
judgment

111 For it hath been signified unto me my brethren of you by them
that are of the house of Chloe that there are contentions among you

112 Now this I say that every one of you saith I indeed am of Paul
and I am of Apollo and I of Cephas and I of Christ

113 Is Christ divided Was Paul then crucified for you Or were you
baptized in the name of Paul

114 I give God thanks that I baptized none of you but Crispus and
Caius

115 Lest any should say that you were baptized in my name

116 And I baptized also the household of Stephanus Besides I know
not whether I baptized any other

117 For Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not
in wisdom of speech lest the cross of Christ should be made void

118 For the word of the cross to them indeed that perish is
foolishness but to them that are saved that is to us it is the
power of God

119 For it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the
prudence of the prudent I will reject

120 Where is the wise Where is the scribe Where is the disputer of
this world Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world

121 For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew
not God it pleased God by the foolishness of our preaching to save
them that believe

122 For both the Jews require signs and the Greeks seek after
wisdom

123 But we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews indeed a
stumblingblock and unto the Gentiles foolishness

124 But unto them that are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the
power of God and the wisdom of God

125 For the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of
God is stronger than men

The foolishness etc  That is to say what appears foolish to the
world in the ways of God is indeed most wise and what appears weak is
indeed above all the strength and comprehension of man

126 For see your vocation brethren that there are not many wise
according to the flesh not many mighty not many noble

127 But the foolish things of the world hath God chosen that he may
confound the wise and the weak things of the world hath God chosen
that he may confound the strong

128 And the base things of the world and the things that are
contemptible hath God chosen and things that are not that he might
bring to nought things that are

129 That no flesh should glory in his sight

130 But of him are you in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us
wisdom and justice and sanctification and redemption

131 That as it is written He that glorieth may glory in the Lord



1 Corinthians Chapter 2


His preaching was not in loftiness of words but in spirit and power
And the wisdom he taught was not to be understood by the worldly wise
or sensual man but only by the spiritual man

21 And I brethren when I came to you came not in loftiness of
speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of Christ

22 For I judged not myself to know anything among you but Jesus
Christ and him crucified

23 And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling

24 And my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of
human wisdom but in shewing of the Spirit and power

25 That your faith might not stand on the wisdom of men but on the
power of God

26 Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect yet not the wisdom of
this world neither of the princes of this world that come to nought

27 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery a wisdom which is
hidden which God ordained before the world unto our glory

28 Which none of the princes of this world knew For if they had
known it they would never have crucified the Lord of glory

29 But as it is written That eye hath not seen nor ear heard
neither hath it entered into the heart of man what things God hath
prepared for them that love him

210 But to us God hath revealed them by his Spirit For the Spirit
searcheth all things yea the deep things of God

211 For what man knoweth the things of a man but the spirit of a man
that is in him So the things also that are of God no man knoweth but
the Spirit of God

212 Now we have received not the spirit of this world but the
Spirit that is of God that we may know the things that are given us
from God

213 Which things also we speak not in the learned words of human
wisdom but in the doctrine of the Spirit comparing spiritual things
with spiritual

214 But the sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the
Spirit of God For it is foolishness to him and he cannot understand
because it is spiritually examined

The sensual manthe spiritual man  The sensual man is either he who
is taken up with sensual pleasures with carnal and worldly affections
or he who measureth divine mysteries by natural reason sense and
human wisdom only Now such a man has little or no notion of the things
of God Whereas the spiritual man is he who in the mysteries of
religion takes not human sense for his guide but submits his judgment
to the decisions of the church which he is commanded to hear and obey
For Christ hath promised to remain to the end of the world with his
church and to direct her in all things by the Spirit of truth

215 But the spiritual man judgeth all things and he himself is
judged of no man

216 For who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct
him But we have the mind of Christ



1 Corinthians Chapter 3


They must not contend about their teachers who are but Gods ministers
and accountable to him Their works shall be tried by fire

31 And I brethren could not speak to you as unto spiritual but as
unto carnal As unto little ones in Christ

32 I gave you milk to drink not meat for you were not able as yet
But neither indeed are you now able for you are yet carnal

33 For whereas there is among you envying and contention are you
not carnal and walk you not according to man

34 For while one saith I indeed am of Paul and another I am of
Apollo are you not men What then is Apollo and what is Paul

35 The ministers of him whom you have believed and to every one as
the Lord hath given

36 I have planted Apollo watered but God gave the increase

37 Therefore neither he that planteth is any thing nor he that
watereth but God that giveth the increase

38 Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one And every man
shall receive his own reward according to his own labour

39 For we are Gods coadjutors You are Gods husbandry you are
Gods building

310 According to the grace of God that is given to me as a wise
architect I have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon
But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon

311 For other foundation no man can lay but that which is laid
which is Christ Jesus

312 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver
precious stones wood hay stubble

Upon this foundation  The foundation is Christ and his doctrine or
the true faith in him working through charity The building upon this
foundation gold silver and precious stones signifies the more
perfect preaching and practice of the gospel the wood hay and
stubble such preaching as that of the Corinthian teachers who
affected the pomp of words and human eloquence and such practice as is
mixed with much imperfection and many lesser sins Now the day of the
Lord and his fiery trial in the particular judgment immediately
after death shall make manifest of what sort every mans work has
been of which during this life it is hard to make a judgment For
then the fire of Gods judgment shall try every mans work And they
whose works like wood hay and stubble cannot abide the fire shall
suffer loss these works being found to be of no value yet they
themselves having built upon the right foundation by living and
dying in the true faith and in the state of grace though with some
imperfection shall be saved yet so as by fire being liable to this
punishment by reason of the wood hay and stubble which was mixed
with their building

313 Every mans work shall be manifest For the day of the Lord shall
declare it because it shall be revealed in fire And the fire shall
try every mans work of what sort it is

314 If any mans work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall
receive a reward

315 If any mans work burn he shall suffer loss but he himself shall
be saved yet so as by fire

316 Know you not that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit
of God dwelleth in you

317 But if any man violate the temple of God him shall God destroy
For the temple of God is holy which you are

318 Let no man deceive himself If any man among you seem to be wise
in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise

319 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God For it is
written I will catch the wise in their own craftiness

320 And again The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they
are vain

321 Let no man therefore glory in men

322 For all things are yours whether it be Paul or Apollo or Cephas
or the world or life or death or things present or things to come
For all are yours

323 And you are Christs And Christ is Gods



1 Corinthians Chapter 4


Gods ministers are not to be judged He reprehends their boasting of
their preachers and describes the treatment the apostles every where
met with

41 Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and the
dispensers of the mysteries of God

42 Here now it is required among the dispensers that a man be found
faithful

43 But to me it is a very small thing to be judged by you or by mans
day But neither do I judge my own self

44 For I am not conscious to myself of anything Yet am I not hereby
justified but he that judgeth me is the Lord

45 Therefore judge not before the time until the Lord come who
both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make
manifest the counsels of the hearts And then shall every man have
praise from God

46 But these things brethren I have in a figure transferred to
myself and to Apollo for your sakes that in us you may learn that one
be not puffed up against the other for another above that which is
written

47 For who distinguisheth thee Or what hast thou that thou hast not
received and if thou hast received why dost thou glory as if thou
hadst not received it

48 You are now full you are now become rich you reign without us
and I would to God you did reign that we also might reign with you

49 For I think that God hath set forth us apostles the last as it
were men appointed to death We are made a spectacle to the world and
to angels and to men

410 We are fools for Christs sake but you are wise in Christ we are
weak but you are strong you are honourable but we without honour

411 Even unto this hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and
are buffeted and have no fixed abode

412 And we labour working with our own hands We are reviled and we
bless We are persecuted and we suffer it

413 We are blasphemed and we entreat We are made as the refuse of
this world the offscouring of all even until now

414 I write not these things to confound you but I admonish you as
my dearest children

415 For if you have ten thousand instructors in Christ yet not many
fathers For in Christ Jesus by the gospel I have begotten you

416 Wherefore I beseech you be ye followers of me as I also am of
Christ

417 For this cause have I sent to you Timothy who is my dearest son
and faithful in the Lord Who will put you in mind of my ways which
are in Christ Jesus as I teach every where in every church

418 As if I would not come to you so some are puffed up

419 But I will come to you shortly if the Lord will and will know
not the speech of them that are puffed up but the power

420 For the kingdom of God is not in speech but in power

421 What will you Shall I come to you with a rod Or in charity and
in the spirit of meekness



1 Corinthians Chapter 5


He excommunicates the incestuous adulterer and admonishes them to purge
out the old leaven

51 It is absolutely heard that there is fornication among you and
such fornication as the like is not among the heathens that one should
have his fathers wife

52 And you are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he might
be taken away from among you that hath done this thing

53 I indeed absent in body but present in spirit have already
judged as though I were present him that hath so done

54 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ you being gathered together
and my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus

55 To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh
that the spirit may be saved in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ

56 Your glorying is not good Know you not that a little leaven
corrupteth the whole lump

57 Purge out the old leaven that you may be a new paste as you are
unleavened For Christ our pasch is sacrificed

58 Therefore let us feast not with the old leaven nor with the
leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of
sincerity and truth

9 I wrote to you in an epistle not to keep company with fornicators

510 I mean not with the fornicators of this world or with the
covetous or the extortioners or the servers of idols otherwise you
must needs go out of this world

511 But now I have written to you not to keep company if any man
that is named a brother be a fornicator or covetous or a server of
idols or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner with such a one not
so much as to eat

512 For what have I to do to judge them that are without Do not you
judge them that are within

513 For them that are without God will judge Put away the evil one
from among yourselves



1 Corinthians Chapter 6


He blames them for going to law before unbelievers Of sins that
exclude from the kingdom of heaven The evil of fornication

61 Dare any of you having a matter against another go to be judged
before the unjust and not before the saints

62 Know you not that the saints shall judge this world And if the
world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest
matters

63 Know you not that we shall judge angels How much more things of
this world

64 If therefore you have judgments of things pertaining to this
world set them to judge who are the most despised in the church

65 I speak to your shame Is it so that there is not among you any
one wise man that is able to judge between his brethren

66 But brother goeth to law with brother and that before
unbelievers

67 Already indeed there is plainly a fault among you that you have
law suits one with another Why do you not rather take wrong Why do
you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded

A fault  Lawsuits can hardly ever be without a fault on the one side
or the other and oftentimes on both sides

68 But you do wrong and defraud and that to your brethren

69 Know you not that the unjust shall not possess the kingdom of God
Do not err Neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers

610 Nor the effeminate nor liers with mankind nor thieves nor
covetous nor drunkards nor railers nor extortioners shall possess the
kingdom of God

611 And such some of you were But you are washed but you are
sanctified but you are justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
and the Spirit of our God

612 All things are lawful to me but all things are not expedient
All things are lawful to me but I will not be brought under the power
of any

All things are lawful etc  That is all indifferent things are
indeed lawful inasmuch as they are not prohibited but oftentimes they
are not expedient as in the case of lawsuits etc And much less would
it be expedient to be enslaved by an irregular affection to any thing
how indifferent soever

613 Meat for the belly and the belly for the meats but God shall
destroy both it and them But the body is not for fornication but for
the Lord and the Lord for the body

614 Now God hath raised up the Lord and will raise us up also by his
power

615 Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ Shall I
then take the members of Christ and make them the members of an harlot
God forbid

616 Or know you not that he who is joined to a harlot is made one
body For they shall be saith he two in one flesh

617 But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit

618 Fly fornication Every sin that a man doth is without the body
but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body

619 Or know you not that your members are the temple of the Holy
Ghost who is in you whom you have from God and you are not your own

620 For you are bought with a great price Glorify and bear God in
your body



1 Corinthians Chapter 7


Lessons relating to marriage and celibacy Virginity is preferable to a
married state

71 Now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me It is good for
a man not to touch a woman

72 But for fear of fornication let every man have his own wife and
let every woman have her own husband

Have his own wife  That is keep to his wife which he hath His
meaning is not to exhort the unmarried to marry on the contrary he
would have them rather continue as they are Ver 78 But he speaks
here to them that are already married who must not depart from one
another but live together as they ought to do in the marriage state

73 Let the husband render the debt to his wife and the wife also in
like manner to the husband

74 The wife hath not power of her own body but the husband And in
like manner the husband also hath not power of his own body but the
wife

75 Defraud not one another except perhaps by consent for a time
that you may give yourselves to prayer and return together again lest
Satan tempt you for your incontinency

76 But I speak this by indulgence not by commandment

By indulgence  That is by a condescension to your weakness

77 For I would that all men were even as myself But every one hath
his proper gift from God one after this manner and another after
that

78 But I say to the unmarried and to the widows It is good for them
if they so continue even as I

79 But if they do not contain themselves let them marry For it is
better to marry than to be burnt

If they do not contain etc  This is spoken of such as are free and
not of such as by vow have given their first faith to God to whom if
they will use proper means to obtain it God will never refuse the gift
of continency Some translators have corrupted this text by rendering
it if they cannot contain

710 But to them that are married not I but the Lord commandeth
that the wife depart not from her husband

711 And if she depart that she remain unmarried or be reconciled to
her husband And let not the husband put away his wife

712 For to the rest I speak not the Lord If any brother hath a wife
that believeth not and she consent to dwell with him let him not put
her away

I speak not the Lord  Viz by any express commandment or
ordinance

713 And if any woman hath a husband that believeth not and he consent
to dwell with her let her not put away her husband

714 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife
and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband
Otherwise your children should be unclean but now they are holy

Is sanctified  The meaning is not that the faith of the husband or
the wife is of itself sufficient to put the unbelieving party or their
children in the state of grace and salvation but that it is very
often an occasion of their sanctification by bringing them to the true
faith

715 But if the unbeliever depart let him depart For a brother or
sister is not under servitude in such cases But God hath called us in
peace

716 For how knowest thou O wife whether thou shalt save thy
husband Or how knowest thou O man whether thou shalt save thy wife

717 But as the Lord hath distributed to every one as God hath called
every one so let him walk And so in all churches I teach

718 Is any man called being circumcised Let him not procure
uncircumcision Is any man called in uncircumcision Let him not be
circumcised

719 Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the
observance of the commandments of God

720 Let every man abide in the same calling in which he was called

721 Wast thou called being a bondman Care not for it but if thou
mayest be made free use it rather

722 For he that is called in the Lord being a bondman is the
freeman of the Lord Likewise he that is called being free is the
bondman of Christ

723 You are bought with a price be not made the bondslaves of men

724 Brethren let every man wherein he was called therein abide
with God

725 Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord but I
give counsel as having obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful

726 I think therefore that this is good for the present necessity
that it is good for a man so to be

727 Art thou bound to a wife Seek not to be loosed Art thou loosed
from a wife Seek not a wife

728 But if thou take a wife thou hast not sinned And if a virgin
marry she hath not sinned nevertheless such shall have tribulation
of the flesh But I spare you

729 This therefore I say brethren The time is short It remaineth
that they also who have wives be as if they had none

730 And they that weep as though they wept not and they that
rejoice as if they rejoiced not and they that buy as if they
possessed not

731 And they that use this world as if they used it not For the
fashion of this world passeth away

732 But I would have you to be without solicitude He that is without
a wife is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord how he may
please God

733 But he that is with a wife is solicitous for the things of the
world how he may please his wife And he is divided

734 And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of
the Lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit But she that
is married thinketh on the things of the world how she may please her
husband

735 And this I speak for your profit not to cast a snare upon you
but for that which is decent and which may give you power to attend
upon the Lord without impediment

736 But if any man think that he seemeth dishonoured with regard to
his virgin for that she is above the age and it must so be let him
do what he will He sinneth not if she marry

Let him do what he will he sinneth not etc  The meaning is not as
libertines would have it that persons may do what they will and not
sin provided they afterwards marry but that the father with regard
to the giving his virgin in marriage may do as he pleaseth and that
it will be no sin to him if she marry

737 For he that hath determined being steadfast in his heart having
no necessity but having power of his own will and hath judged this in
his heart to keep his virgin doth well

738 Therefore both he that giveth his virgin in marriage doth well
and he that giveth her not doth better

739 A woman is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth but if
her husband die she is at liberty Let her marry to whom she will
only in the Lord

740 But more blessed shall she be if she so remain according to my
counsel And I think that I also have the spirit of God



1 Corinthians Chapter 8


Though an idol be nothing yet things offered up to idols are not to be
eaten for fear of scandal

81 Now concerning those things that are sacrificed to idols we know
we all have knowledge Knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth

Knowledge puffeth up etc  Knowledge without charity and humility
serveth only to puff persons up

82 And if any man think that he knoweth any thing he hath not yet
known as he ought to know

83 But if any man love God the same is known by him

84 But as for the meats that are sacrificed to idols we know that an
idol is nothing in the world and that there is no God but one

85 For although there be that are called gods either in heaven or on
earth for there be gods many and lords many

Gods many etc  Reputed for such among the heathens

86 Yet to us there is but one God the Father of whom are all
things and we unto him and one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all
things and we by him

87 But there is not knowledge in every one For some until this
present with conscience of the idol eat as a thing sacrificed to an
idol and their conscience being weak is defiled

88 But meat doth not commend us to God For neither if we eat shall
we have the more nor if we eat not shall we have the less

89 But take heed lest perhaps this your liberty become a
stumblingblock to the weak

810 For if a man see him that hath knowledge sit at meat in the
idols temple shall not his conscience being weak be emboldened to
eat those things which are sacrificed to idols

811 And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom
Christ hath died

812 Now when you sin thus against the brethren and wound their weak
conscience you sin against Christ

813 Wherefore if meat scandalize my brother I will never eat flesh
lest I should scandalize my brother

If meat scandalize  That is if my eating cause my brother to sin



1 Corinthians Chapter 9


The apostle did not make use of his power of being maintained at the
charges of those to whom he preached that he might give no hindrance
to the gospel Of running in the race and striving for the mastery

91 Am I not I free Am not I an apostle Have not I seen Christ Jesus
our Lord Are not you my work in the Lord

92 And if unto others I be not an apostle but yet to you I am For
you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord

93 My defence with them that do examine me is this

94 Have not we power to eat and to drink

95 Have we not power to carry about a woman a sister as well as the
rest of the apostles and the brethren of the Lord and Cephas

A woman a sister  Some erroneous translators have corrupted this
text by rendering it a sister a wife whereas it is certain St
Paul had no wife chap 7 ver 7 8 and that he only speaks of such
devout women as according to the custom of the Jewish nation waited
upon the preachers of the gospel and supplied them with necessaries

96 Or I only and Barnabas have not we power to do this

97 Who serveth as a soldier at any time at his own charges Who
planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof Who feedeth
the flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock

98 Speak I these things according to man Or doth not the law also
say these things

99 For it is written in the law of Moses Thou shalt not muzzle the
mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn Doth God take care for
oxen

910 Or doth he say this indeed for our sakes For these things are
written for our sakes that he that plougheth should plough in hope
and he that thrasheth in hope to receive fruit

911 If we have sown unto you spiritual things is it a great matter
if we reap your carnal things

912 If others be partakers of this power over you why not we rather
Nevertheless we have not used this power but we bear all things lest
we should give any hindrance to the gospel of Christ

913 Know you not that they who work in the holy place eat the things
that are of the holy place and they that serve the altar partake with
the altar

914 So also the Lord ordained that they who preach the gospel should
live by the gospel

915 But I have used none of these things Neither have I written
these things that they should be so done unto me for it is good for
me to die rather than that any man should make my glory void

916 For if I preach the gospel it is no glory to me for a necessity
lieth upon me For woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel

It is no glory  That is I have nothing to glory of

917 For if I do this thing willingly I have a reward but if against
my will a dispensation is committed to me

918 What is my reward then That preaching the gospel I may deliver
the gospel without charge that I abuse not my power in the gospel

919 For whereas I was free as to all I made myself the servant of
all that I might gain the more

920 And I became to the Jews a Jew that I might gain the Jews

922 To the weak I became weak that I might gain the weak I became
all things to all men that I might save all

923 And I do all things for the gospels sake that I may be made
partaker thereof

924 Know you not that they that run in the race all run indeed but
one receiveth the prize So run that you may obtain

925 And every one that striveth for the mastery refraineth himself
from all things And they indeed that they may receive a corruptible
crown but we an incorruptible one

926 I therefore so run not as at an uncertainty I so fight not as
one beating the air

927 But I chastise my body and bring it into subjection lest
perhaps when I have preached to others I myself should become a
castaway

I chastise etc  Here St Paul shews the necessity of selfdenial and
mortification to subdue the flesh and its inordinate desires



1 Corinthians Chapter 10


By the example of the Israelites he shews that we are not to build too
much upon favours received but to avoid their sins and fly from the
service of idols and from things offered to idols

101 For I would not have you ignorant brethren that our fathers
were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea

102 And all in Moses were baptized in the cloud and in the sea

In Moses  Under the conduct of Moses they received baptism in
figure by passing under the cloud and through the sea and they
partook of the body and blood of Christ in figure by eating of the
manna called here a spiritual food because it was a figure of the
true bread which comes down from heaven and drinking the water
miraculously brought out of the rock called here a spiritual rock
because it was also a figure of Christ

103 And did all eat the same spiritual food

104 And all drank the same spiritual drink And they drank of the
spiritual rock that followed them and the rock was Christ

105 But with most of them God was not well pleased for they were
overthrown in the desert

106 Now these things were done in a figure of us that we should not
covet evil things as they also coveted

107 Neither become ye idolaters as some of them as it is written
The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play

108 Neither let us commit fornication as some of them that committed
fornication and there fell in one day three and twenty thousand

109 Neither let us tempt Christ as some of them tempted and perished
by the serpent

1010 Neither do you murmur as some of them murmured and were
destroyed by the destroyer

1011 Now all these things happened to them in figure and they are
written for our correction upon whom the ends of the world are come

The ends of the world  That is the last ages

1012 Wherefore he that thinketh himself to stand let him take heed
lest he fall

1013 Let no temptation take hold on you but such as is human And
God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which
you are able but will make also with temptation issue that you may be
able to bear it

Or  no temptation hath taken hold of you  or come upon you as yet
but what is human or incident to man Issue  or a way to escape

1014 Wherefore my dearly beloved fly from the service of idols

1015 I speak as to wise men judge ye yourselves what I say

1016 The chalice of benediction which we bless is it not the
communion of the blood of Christ And the bread which we break is it
not the partaking of the body of the Lord

Which we bless  Here the apostle puts them in mind of their partaking
of the body and blood of Christ in the sacred mysteries and becoming
thereby one mystical body with Christ From whence he infers ver 21
that they who are made partakers with Christ by the eucharistic
sacrifice and sacrament must not be made partakers with devils by
eating of the meats sacrificed to them

1017 For we being many are one bread one body all that partake of
one bread

One bread  or as it may be rendered agreeably both to the Latin and
Greek because the bread is one all we being many are one body who
partake of that one bread For it is by our communicating with Christ
and with one another in this blessed sacrament that we are formed
into one mystical body and made as it were one bread compounded of
many grains of corn closely united together

1018 Behold Israel according to the flesh Are not they that eat of
the sacrifices partakers of the altar

1019 What then Do I say that what is offered in sacrifice to idols
is any thing Or that the idol is any thing

1020 But the things which the heathens sacrifice they sacrifice to
devils and not to God And I would not that you should be made
partakers with devils

1021 You cannot drink the chalice of the Lord and the chalice of
devils you cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord and of the
table of devils

1022 Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy Are we stronger than he All
things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient

1023 All things are lawful for me but all things do not edify

1024 Let no man seek his own but that which is anothers

1025 Whatsoever is sold in the shambles eat asking no question for
conscience sake

1026 The earth is the Lords and the fulness thereof

1027 If any of them that believe not invite you and you be willing
to go eat of any thing that is set before you asking no question for
conscience sake

1028 But if any man say This has been sacrificed to idols do not
eat of it for his sake that told it and for conscience sake

1029 Conscience I say not thy own but the others For why is my
liberty judged by another mans conscience

1030 If I partake with thanksgiving why am I evil spoken of for that
for which I give thanks

1031 Therefore whether you eat or drink or whatsoever else you do
do all to the glory of God

1032 Be without offence to the Jew and to the Gentiles and to the
church of God

1033 As I also in all things please all men not seeking that which
is profitable to myself but to many that they may be saved



1 Corinthians Chapter 11


Women must have a covering over their heads He blameth the abuses of
their love feasts and upon that occasion treats of the Blessed
Sacrament

111 Be ye followers of me as I also am of Christ

112 Now I praise you brethren that in all things you are mindful of
me and keep my ordinances as I have delivered them to you

113 But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ
and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God

114 Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered disgraceth
his head

115 But every woman praying or prophesying with her head not covered
disgraceth her head for it is all one as if she were shaven

116 For if a woman be not covered let her be shorn But if it be a
shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald let her cover her head

117 The man indeed ought not to cover his head because he is the
image and glory of God But the woman is the glory of the man

118 For the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man

119 For the man was not created for the woman but the woman for the
man

1110 Therefore ought the woman to have a power over her head because
of the angels

A power  that is a veil or covering as a sign that she is under the
power of her husband and this the apostle adds because of the
angels who are present in the assemblies of the faithful

1111 But yet neither is the man without the woman nor the woman
without the man in the Lord

1112 For as the woman is of the man so also is the man by the woman
but all things of God

1113 You yourselves judge Doth it become a woman to pray unto God
uncovered

1114 Doth not even nature itself teach you that a man indeed if he
nourish his hair it is a shame unto him

1115 But if a woman nourish her hair it is a glory to her for her
hair is given to her for a covering

1116 But if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom
nor the Church of God

1117 Now this I ordain not praising you that you come together not
for the better but for the worse

1118 For first of all I hear that when you come together in the
church there are schisms among you And in part I believe it

1119 For there must be also heresies that they also who are
approved may be made manifest among you

There must be also heresies  By reason of the pride and perversity of
mans heart not by Gods will or appointment who nevertheless draws
good out of this evil manifesting by that occasion who are the good
and firm Christians and making their faith more remarkable

1120 When you come therefore together into one place it is not now
to eat the Lords supper

The Lords supper  So the apostle here calls the charity feasts
observed by the primitive Christians and reprehends the abuses of the
Corinthians on these occasions which were the more criminal because
these feasts were accompanied with the celebrating of the eucharistic
sacrifice and sacrament

1121 For every one taketh before his own supper to eat And one
indeed is hungry and another is drunk

1122 What have you no houses to eat and to drink in Or despise ye
the church of God and put them to shame that have not What shall I say
to you Do I praise you In this I praise you not

1123 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto
you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took
bread

1124 And giving thanks broke and said Take ye and eat This is my
body which shall be delivered for you This do for the commemoration
of me

1125 In like manner also the chalice after he had supped saying
This chalice is the new testament in my blood This do ye as often as
you shall drink for the commemoration of me

1126 For as often as you shall eat this bread and drink the chalice
you shall shew the death of the Lord until he come

1127 Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread or drink the chalice
of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of
the Lord

Or drink  Here erroneous translators corrupted the text by putting
and drink contrary to the original instead of or drink

Guilty of the body etc not discerning the body etc  This
demonstrates the real presence of the body and blood of Christ even to
the unworthy communicant who otherwise could not be guilty of the body
and blood of Christ or justly condemned for not discerning the Lords
body

1128 But let a man prove himself and so let him eat of that bread
and drink of the chalice

Drink of the chalice  This is not said by way of command but by way
of allowance viz where and when it is agreeable to the practice and
discipline of the church

1129 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
judgment to himself not discerning the body of the Lord

1130 Therefore are there many infirm and weak among you and many
sleep

1131 But if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged

1132 But whilst we are judged we are chastised by the Lord that we
be not condemned with this world

1133 Wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat wait for
one another

1134 If any man be hungry let him eat at home that you come not
together unto judgment And the rest I will set in order when I come



1 Corinthians Chapter 12


Of the diversity of spiritual gifts The members of the mystical body
like those of the natural body must mutually cherish one another

121 Now concerning spiritual things my brethren I would not have
you ignorant

122 You know that when you were heathens you went to dumb idols
according as you were led

123 Wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the
Spirit of God saith Anathema to Jesus And no man can say The Lord
Jesus but by the Holy Ghost

124 Now there are diversities of graces but the same Spirit

125 And there are diversities of ministries but the same Lord

126 And there are diversities of operations but the same God who
worketh all in all

127 And the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man unto
profit

128 To one indeed by the Spirit is given the word of wisdom and to
another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit

129 To another faith in the same spirit to another the grace of
healing in one Spirit

1210 To another the working of miracles to another prophecy to
another the discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of
tongues to another interpretation of speeches

1211 But all these things one and the same Spirit worketh dividing
to every one according as he will

1212 For as the body is one and hath many members and all the
members of the body whereas they are many yet are one body So also
is Christ

1213 For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body whether
Jews or Gentiles whether bond or free and in one Spirit we have all
been made to drink

1214 For the body also is not one member but many

1215 If the foot should say Because I am not the hand I am not of
the body Is it therefore not of the Body

1216 And if the ear should say Because I am not the eye I am not of
the body Is it therefore not of the body

1217 If the whole body were the eye where would be the hearing If
the whole were hearing where would be the smelling

1218 But now God hath set the members every one of them in the body
as it hath pleased him

1219 And if they all were one member where would be the body

1220 But now there are many members indeed yet one body

1221 And the eye cannot say to the hand I need not thy help Nor
again the head to the feet I have no need of you

1222 Yea much more those that seem to be the more feeble members of
the body are more necessary

1223 And such as we think to be the less honourable members of the
body about these we put more abundant honour and those that are our
uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness

1224 But our comely parts have no need but God hath tempered the
body together giving to that which wanted the more abundant honour

1225 That there might be no schism in the body but the members might
be mutually careful one for another

1226 And if one member suffer any thing all the members suffer with
it or if one member glory all the members rejoice with it

1227 Now you are the body of Christ and members of member

1228 And God indeed hath set some in the church first apostles
secondly prophets thirdly doctors after that miracles then the
graces of healings helps governments kinds of tongues
interpretations of speeches

1229 Are all apostles Are all prophets Are all doctors

1230 Are all workers of miracles Have all the grace of healing Do
all speak with tongues Do all interpret

1231 But be zealous for the better gifts And I shew unto you yet a
more excellent way



1 Corinthians Chapter 13


Charity is to be preferred before all gifts

131 If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not
charity I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal

132 And if I should have prophecy and should know all mysteries and
all knowledge and if I should have all faith so that I could remove
mountains and have not charity I am nothing

133 And if I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor and if
I should deliver my body to be burned and have not charity it
profiteth me nothing

134 Charity is patient is kind charity envieth not dealeth not
perversely is not puffed up

135 Is not ambitious seeketh not her own is not provoked to anger
thinketh no evil

136 Rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth with the truth

137 Beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things
endureth all things

138 Charity never falleth away whether prophecies shall be made void
or tongues shall cease or knowledge shall be destroyed

139 For we know in part and we prophesy in part

1310 But when that which is perfect is come that which is in part
shall be done away

1311 When I was a child I spoke as a child I understood as a child
I thought as a child But when I became a man I put away the things
of a child

1312 We see now through a glass in a dark manner but then face to
face Now I know in part but then I shall know even as I am known

1313 And now there remain faith hope and charity these three but
the greatest of these is charity



1 Corinthians Chapter 14


The gift of prophesying is to be preferred before that of speaking
strange tongues

141 Follow after charity be zealous for spiritual gifts but rather
that you may prophesy

Prophesy  That is declare or expound the mysteries of faith

142 For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men but unto
God for no man heareth Yet by the Spirit he speaketh mysteries

Not unto men  Viz so as to be heard that is so as to be
understood by them

143 But he that prophesieth speaketh to men unto edification and
exhortation and comfort

144 He that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself but he that
prophesieth edifieth the church

145 And I would have you all to speak with tongues but rather to
prophesy For greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with
tongues unless perhaps he interpret that the church may receive
edification

146 But now brethren if I come to you speaking with tongues what
shall I profit you unless I speak to you either in revelation or in
knowledge or in prophecy or in doctrine

147 Even things without life that give sound whether pipe or harp
except they give a distinction of sounds how shall it be known what is
piped or harped

148 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare
himself to the battle

149 So likewise you except you utter by the tongue plain speech how
shall it be known what is said For you shall be speaking into the air

1410 There are for example so many kinds of tongues in this world
and none is without voice

1411 If then I know not the power of the voice I shall be to him to
whom I speak a barbarian and he that speaketh a barbarian to me

1412 So you also forasmuch as you are zealous of spirits seek to
abound unto the edifying of the church

Of spirits  Of spiritual gifts

1413 And therefore he that speaketh by a tongue let him pray that he
may interpret

1414 For if I pray in a tongue my spirit prayeth but my
understanding is without fruit

1415 What is it then I will pray with the spirit I will pray also
with the understanding I will sing with the spirit I will sing also
with the understanding

1416 Else if thou shalt bless with the spirit how shall he that
holdeth the place of the unlearned say Amen to thy blessing Because
he knoweth not what thou sayest

Amen  The unlearned not knowing that you are then blessing will not
be qualified to join with you by saying Amen to your blessing The use
or abuse of strange tongues of which the apostle here speaks does not
regard the public liturgy of the church in which strange tongues were
never used but certain conferences of the faithful ver 26 etc in
which meeting together they discovered to one another their various
miraculous gifts of the Spirit common in those primitive times
amongst which the apostle prefers that of prophesying before that of
speaking strange tongues because it was more to the public
edification Where also not that the Latin used in our liturgy is so
far from being a strange or unknown tongue that it is perhaps the best
known tongue in the world

1417 For thou indeed givest thanks well but the other is not
edified

1418 I thank my God I speak with all your tongues

1419 But in the church I had rather speak five words with my
understanding that I may instruct others also than ten thousand words
in a tongue

1420 Brethren do not become children in sense But in malice be
children and in sense be perfect

1421 In the law it is written In other tongues and other lips I will
speak to this people and neither so will they hear me saith the Lord

1422 Wherefore tongues are for a sign not to believers but to
unbelievers but prophecies not to unbelievers but to believers

1423 If therefore the whole church come together into one place and
all speak with tongues and there come in unlearned persons or
infidels will they not say that you are mad

1424 But if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or
an unlearned person he is convinced of all he is judged of all

1425 The secrets of his heart are made manifest And so falling down
on his face he will adore God affirming that God is among you indeed

1426 How is it then brethren When you come together every one of
you hath a psalm hath a doctrine hath a revelation hath a tongue
hath an interpretation let all things be done to edification

1427 If any speak with a tongue let it be by two or at the most by
three and in course and let one interpret

1428 But if there be no interpreter let him hold his peace in the
church and speak to himself and to God

1429 And let the prophets speak two or three and let the rest
judge

1430 But if any thing be revealed to another sitting let the first
hold his peace

1431 For you may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all
may be exhorted

1432 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets

1433 For God is not the God of dissension but of peace as also I
teach in all the churches of the saints

1434 Let women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted
them to speak but to be subject as also the law saith

1435 But if they would learn anything let them ask their husbands at
home For it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church

1436 Or did the word of God come out from you Or came it only unto
you

1437 If any seem to be a prophet or spiritual let him know the
things that I write to you that they are the commandments of the Lord

1438 But if any man know not he shall not be known

1439 Wherefore brethren be zealous to prophesy and forbid not to
speak with tongues

1440 But let all things be done decently and according to order



1 Corinthians Chapter 15


Christs resurrection and ours The manner of our resurrection

151 Now I make known unto you brethren the gospel which I preached
to you which also you have received and wherein you stand

152 By which also you are saved if you hold fast after what manner I
preached unto you unless you have believed in vain

153 For I delivered unto you first of all which I also received how
that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures

154 And that he was buried and that he rose again according to the
scriptures

155 And that he was seen by Cephas and after that by the eleven

156 Then was he seen by more than five hundred brethren at once of
whom many remain until this present and some are fallen asleep

157 After that he was seen by James then by all the apostles

158 And last of all he was seen also by me as by one born out of
due tine

159 For I am the least of the apostles who am not worthy to be
called an apostle because I persecuted the church of God

1510 But by the grace of God I am what I am And his grace in me
hath not been void but I have laboured more abundantly than all they
Yet not I but the grace of God with me

1511 For whether I or they so we preach and so you have believed

1512 Now if Christ be preached that he arose again from the dead
how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead

1513 But if there be no resurrection of the dead then Christ is not
risen again

1514 And if Christ be not risen again then is our preaching vain
and your faith is also vain

1515 Yea and we are found false witnesses of God because we have
given testimony against God that he hath raised up Christ whom he
hath not raised up if the dead rise not again

1516 For if the dead rise not again neither is Christ risen again

1517 And if Christ be not risen again your faith is vain for you
are yet in your sins

1518 Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ are perished

1519 If in this life only we have hope in Christ we are of all men
most miserable

1520 But now Christ is risen from the dead the firstfruits of them
that sleep

1521 For by a man came death and by a man the resurrection of the
dead

1522 And as in Adam all die so also in Christ all shall be made
alive

1523 But every one in his own order the firstfruits Christ then
they that are of Christ who have believed in his coming

1524 Afterwards the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom
to God and the Father when he shall have brought to nought all
principality and power and virtue

1525 For he must reign until he hath put all his enemies under his
feet

1526 And the enemy death shall be destroyed last For he hath put
all things under his feet And whereas he saith

1527 All things are put under him undoubtedly he is excepted who
put all things under him

1528 And when all things shall be subdued unto him then the Son also
himself shall be subject unto him that put all things under him that
God may be all in all

The Son also himself shall be subject unto him  That is the Son will
be subject to the Father according to his human nature even after the
general resurrection and also the whole mystical body of Christ will
be entirely subject to God obeying him in every thing

1529 Otherwise what shall they do that are baptized for the dead if
the dead rise not again at all Why are they then baptized for them

That are baptized for the dead  Some think the apostle here alludes
to a ceremony then in use but others more probably to the prayers
and penitential labours performed by the primitive Christians for the
souls of the faithful departed or to the baptism of afflictions and
sufferings undergone for sinners spiritually dead

1530 Why also are we in danger every hour

1531 I die daily I protest by your glory brethren which I have in
Christ Jesus our Lord

1532 If according to man I fought with beasts at Ephesus what doth
it profit me if the dead rise not again Let us eat and drink for to
morrow we shall die

Let us eat and drink etc  That is if we did not believe that we
were to rise again from the dead we might live like the impious and
wicked who have no belief in the resurrection

1533 Be not seduced Evil communications corrupt good manners

1534 Awake ye just and sin not For some have not the knowledge of
God I speak it to your shame

1535 But some man will say How do the dead rise again Or with what
manner of body shall they come

1536 Senseless man that which thou sowest is not quickened except
it die first

1537 And that which thou sowest thou sowest not the body that shall
be but bare grain as of wheat or of some of the rest

1538 But God giveth it a body as he will and to every seed its
proper body

1539 All flesh is not the same flesh but one is the flesh of men
another of beasts other of birds another of fishes

1540 And there are bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial but one
is the glory of the celestial and another of the terrestrial

1541 One is the glory of the sun another the glory of the moon and
another the glory of the stars For star differeth from star in glory

1542 So also is the resurrection of the dead It is sown in
corruption it shall rise in incorruption

1543 It is sown in dishonour it shall rise in glory It is sown in
weakness it shall rise in power

1544 It is sown a natural body it shall rise a spiritual body If
there be a natural body there is also a spiritual body as it is
written

1545 The first man Adam was made into a living soul the last Adam
into a quickening spirit

1546 Yet that was not first which is spiritual but that which is
natural afterwards that which is spiritual

1547 The first man was of the earth earthly the second man from
heaven heavenly

1548 Such as is the earthly such also are the earthly and such as
is the heavenly such also are they that are heavenly

1549 Therefore as we have borne the image of the earthly let us
bear also the image of the heavenly

1550 Now this I say brethren that flesh and blood cannot possess
the kingdom of God neither shall corruption possess incorruption

1551 Behold I tell you a mystery We shall all indeed rise again
but we shall not all be changed

1552 In a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet
for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall rise again
incorruptible And we shall be changed

1553 For this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal
must put on immortality

1554 And when this mortal hath put on immortality then shall come to
pass the saying that is written Death is swallowed up in victory

1555 O death where is thy victory O death where is thy sting

1556 Now the sting of death is sin and the power of sin is the law

1557 But thanks be to God who hath given us the victory through our
Lord Jesus Christ

1558 Therefore my beloved brethren be ye steadfast and unmoveable
always abounding in the work of the Lord knowing that your labour is
not in vain in the Lord



1 Corinthians Chapter 16


Of collection of alms Admonitions and salutations

161 Now concerning the collections that are made for the saints as I
have given order to the churches of Galatia so do ye also

162 On the first day of the week let every one of you put apart with
himself laying up what it shall well please him that when I come the
collections be not then to be made

163 And when I shall be with you whomsoever you shall approve by
letters them will I send to carry your grace to Jerusalem

164 And if it be meet that I also go they shall go with me

165 Now I will come to you when I shall have passed through
Macedonia For I shall pass through Macedonia

166 And with you perhaps I shall abide or even spend the winter
that you may bring me on my way whithersoever I shall go

167 For I will not see you now by the way for I trust that I shall
abide with you some time if the Lord permit

168 But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost

169 For a great door and evident is opened unto me and many
adversaries

1610 Now if Timothy come see that he be with you without fear for
he worketh the work of the Lord as I also do

1611 Let no man therefore despise him but conduct ye him on his way
in peace that he may come to me For I look for him with the brethren

1612 And touching our brother Apollo I give you to understand that I
much entreated him to come unto you with the brethren and indeed it
was not his will at all to come at this time But he will come when he
shall have leisure

1613 Watch ye stand fast in the faith do manfully and be
strengthened

1614 Let all your things be done in charity

1615 And I beseech you brethren you know the house of Stephanus
and of Fortunatus and of Achaicus that they are the firstfruits of
Achaia and have dedicated themselves to the ministry of the saints

1616 That you also be subject to such and to every one that worketh
with us and laboureth

1617 And I rejoice in the presence of Stephanus and Fortunatus and
Achaicus because that which was wanting on your part they have
supplied

1618 For they have refreshed both my spirit and yours Know them
therefore that are such

1619 The churches of Asia salute you Aquila and Priscilla salute you
much in the Lord with the church that is in their house with whom I
also lodge

1620 All the brethren salute you Salute one another with a holy
kiss

1621 The salutation of me Paul with my own hand

1622 If any man love not our Lord Jesus Christ let him be anathema
maranatha

Let him be anathema maranatha  Anathema signifies here a thing
accursed Maranatha which according to St Jerome and St
Chrysostom signify The Lord is come already and therefore is to be
taken as an admonition to those who doubted of the resurrection and to
put them in mind that Christ the judge of the living and the dead is
come already Others explain Maranatha May our Lord come that is
to judge and punish those with exemplary judgments and punishments
that do not love the Lord Jesus Christ

1623 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you

1624 My charity be with you all in Christ Jesus Amen




THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS



In this Epistle St Paul comforts those who are now reformed by his
admonitions to them in the former and absolves the incestuous man on
doing penance whom he had before excommunicated for his crime Hence
he treats of true penance and of the dignity of the ministers of the
New Testament He cautions the faithful against false teachers and the
society of infidels He gives an account of his sufferings and also of
the favours and graces which God hath bestowed on him This second
Epistle was written in the same year with the first and sent by Titus
from some place in Macedonia



2 Corinthians Chapter 1


He speaks of his troubles in Asia His not coming to them was not out
of levity The constancy and sincerity of his doctrine

11 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God and Timothy
our brother to the church of God that is at Corinth with all the
saints that are in all Achaia

12 Grace unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord
Jesus Christ

13 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ the Father
of mercies and the God of all comfort

14 Who comforteth us in all our tribulation that we also may be able
to comfort them who are in all distress by the exhortation wherewith
we also are exhorted by God

15 For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us so also by Christ
doth our comfort abound

16 Now whether we be in tribulation it is for your exhortation and
salvation or whether we be comforted it is for your consolation or
whether we be exhorted it is for your exhortation and salvation which
worketh the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer

17 That our hope for you may be steadfast knowing that as you are
partakers of the sufferings so shall you be also of the consolation

18 For we would not have you ignorant brethren of our tribulation
which came to us in Asia that we were pressed out of measure above our
strength so that we were weary even of life

19 But we had in ourselves the answer of death that we should not
trust in ourselves but in God who raiseth the dead

110 Who hath delivered and doth deliver us out of so great dangers
in whom we trust that he will yet also deliver us

111 You helping withal in prayer for us That for this gift obtained
for us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many in
our behalf

112 For our glory is this the testimony of our conscience that in
simplicity of heart and sincerity of God and not in carnal wisdom but
in the grace of God we have conversed in this world and more
abundantly towards you

113 For we write no other things to you than what you have read and
known And I hope that you shall know unto the end

114 As also you have known us in part that we are your glory as you
also are ours in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ

115 And in this confidence I had a mind to come to you before that
you might have a second grace

116 And to pass by you into Macedonia and again from Macedonia to
come to you and by you to be brought on my way towards Judea

117 Whereas then I was thus minded did I use lightness Or the
things that I purpose do I purpose according to the flesh that there
should be with me It is and It is not

118 But God is faithful for our preaching which was to you was not
It is and It is not

119 For the Son of God Jesus Christ who was preached among you by
us by me and Sylvanus and Timothy was not It is and It is not But
It is was in him

It is was in him  There was no inconstancy in the doctrine of the
apostles sometimes like modern sectaries saying It is and at other
times saying It is not But their doctrine was ever the same one
uniform yea in Jesus Christ one Amen that is one truth in him

120 For all the promises of God are in him It is Therefore also by
him amen to God unto our glory

121 Now he that confirmeth us with you in Christ and that hath
anointed us is God

122 Who also hath sealed us and given the pledge of the Spirit in our
hearts

123 But I call God to witness upon my soul that to spare you I came
not any more to Corinth not because we exercise dominion over your
faith but we are helpers of your joy For in faith you stand



2 Corinthians Chapter 2


He grants a pardon to the incestuous man upon his doing penance

21 But I determined this with myself to come to you again in sorrow

22 For if I make you sorrowful who is he then that can make me glad
but the same who is made sorrowful by me

23 And I wrote this same to you that I may not when I come have
sorrow upon sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice having
confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all

24 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you
with many tears not that you should be made sorrowful but that you
might know the charity I have more abundantly towards you

25 And if any one have caused grief he hath not grieved me but in
part that I may not burden you all

26 To him who is such a one this rebuke is sufficient which is
given by many

27 So that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort
him lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow

28 Wherefore I beseech you that you would confirm your charity
towards him

29 For to this end also did I write that I may know the experiment
of you whether you be obedient in all things

210 And to whom you have pardoned any thing I also For what I have
pardoned if I have pardoned any thing for your sakes have I done it
in the person of Christ

I also  The apostle here granted an indulgence or pardon in the
person and by the authority of Christ to the incestuous Corinthian
whom before he had put under penance which pardon consisted in a
releasing of part of the temporal punishment due to his sin

211 That we be not overreached by Satan For we are not ignorant of
his devices

212 And when I was come to Troas for the gospel of Christ and a door
was opened unto me in the Lord

213 I had no rest in my spirit because I found not Titus my brother
but bidding them farewell I went into Macedonia

214 Now thanks be to God who always maketh us to triumph in Christ
Jesus and manifesteth the odour of his knowledge by us in every place

215 For we are the good odour of Christ unto God in them that are
saved and in them that perish

216 To the one indeed the odour of death unto death but to the
others the odour of life unto life And for these things who is so
sufficient

The odour of death etc  The preaching of the apostle which by its
fragrant odour brought many to life was to others through their own
fault the occasion of death by their wilfully opposing and resisting
that divine call

217 For we are not as many adulterating the word of God but with
sincerity but as from God before God in Christ we speak



2 Corinthians Chapter 3


He needs no commendatory letters The glory of the ministry of the New
Testament

31 Do we begin again to commend ourselves Or do we need as some do
epistles of commendation to you or from you

32 You are our epistle written in our hearts which is known and
read by all men

33 Being manifested that you are the epistle of Christ ministered
by us and written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God
not in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart

34 And such confidence we have through Christ towards God

35 Not that we are sufficient to think any thing of ourselves as of
ourselves but our sufficiency is from God

36 Who also hath made us fit ministers of the new testament not in
the letter but in the spirit For the letter killeth but the spirit
quickeneth

The letter  Not rightly understood and taken without the spirit

37 Now if the ministration of death engraven with letters upon
stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not
steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his
countenance which is made void

38 How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather in glory

39 For if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more the
ministration of justice aboundeth in glory

310 For even that which was glorious in this part was not glorified
by reason of the glory that excelleth

311 For if that which is done away was glorious much more that which
remaineth is in glory

312 Having therefore such hope we use much confidence

313 And not as Moses put a veil upon his face that the children of
Israel might not steadfastly look on the face of that which is made
void

314 But their senses were made dull For until this present day the
selfsame veil in the reading of the old testament remaineth not taken
away because in Christ it is made void

315 But even until this day when Moses is read the veil is upon
their heart

316 But when they shall be converted to the Lord the veil shall be
taken away

317 Now the Lord is a Spirit And where the Spirit of the Lord is
there is liberty

318 But we all beholding the glory of the Lord with open face are
transformed into the same image from glory to glory as by the Spirit
of the Lord



2 Corinthians Chapter 4


The sincerity of his preaching His comfort in his afflictions

41 Therefore seeing we have this ministration according as we have
obtained mercy we faint not

42 But we renounce the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in
craftiness nor adulterating the word of God but by manifestation of
the truth commending ourselves to every mans conscience in the sight
of God

43 And if our gospel be also hid it is hid to them that are lost

44 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of
unbelievers that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ who
is the image of God should not shine unto them

45 For we preach not ourselves but Jesus Christ our Lord and
ourselves your servants through Jesus

46 For God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath
shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory
of God in the face of Christ Jesus

47 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency
may be of the power of God and not of us

48 In all things we suffer tribulation but are not distressed We
are straitened but are not destitute

49 We suffer persecution but are not forsaken We are cast down
but we perish not

410 Always bearing about in our body the mortification of Jesus that
the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our bodies

411 For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake
that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh

412 So then death worketh in us but life in you

413 But having the same spirit of faith as it is written I
believed for which cause I have spoken we also believe For which
cause we speak also

414 Knowing that he who raised up Jesus will raise us up also with
Jesus and place us with you

415 For all things are for your sakes that the grace abounding
through many may abound in thanksgiving unto the glory of God

416 For which cause we faint not but though our outward man is
corrupted yet the inward man is renewed day by day

417 For that which is at present momentary and light of our
tribulation worketh for us above measure exceedingly an eternal weight
of glory

418 While we look not at the things which are seen but at the things
which are not seen For the things which are seen are temporal but the
things which are not seen are eternal



2 Corinthians Chapter 5


He is willing to leave his earthly mansion to be with the Lord His
charity to the Corinthians

51 For we know if our earthly house of this habitation be dissolved
that we have a building of God a house not made with hands eternal in
heaven

52 For in this also we groan desiring to be clothed upon with our
habitation that is from heaven

53 Yet so that we be found clothed not naked

54 For we also who are in this tabernacle do groan being
burthened because we would not be unclothed but clothed upon that
that which is mortal may be swallowed up by life

55 Now he that maketh us for this very thing is God who hath given
us the pledge of the Spirit

56 Therefore having always confidence knowing that while we are in
the body we are absent from the Lord

57 For we walk by faith and not by sight

58 But we are confident and have a good will to be absent rather from
the body and to be present with the Lord

59 And therefore we labour whether absent or present to please him

510 For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ
that every one may receive the proper things of the body according as
he hath done whether it be good or evil

The proper things of the body  In the particular judgment
immediately after death the soul is rewarded or punished according to
what it has done in the body

511 Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord we use persuasion to men
but to God we are manifest And I trust also that in your consciences
we are manifest

512 We commend not ourselves again to you but give you occasion to
glory in our behalf that you may have somewhat to answer them who
glory in face and not in heart

513 For whether we be transported in mind it is to God or whether
we be sober it is for you

514 For the charity of Christ presseth us judging this that if one
died for all then all were dead

515 And Christ died for all that they also who live may not now live
to themselves but unto him who died for them and rose again

516 Wherefore henceforth we know no man according to the flesh And
if we have known Christ according to the flesh but now we know him so
no longer

We know no man according to the flesh  That is we consider not any
man with regard to his nation family kindred or other natural
qualities or advantages but only with relation to Christ and
according to the order of divine charity in God and for God The
apostle adds that even with respect to Christ himself he now no
longer considers him according to the flesh by taking a satisfaction
in his being his countryman his affection being now purified from all
such earthly considerations

517 If then any be in Christ a new creature the old things are
passed away Behold all things are made new

518 But all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by
Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation

519 For God indeed was in Christ reconciling the world to himself
not imputing to them their sins And he hath placed in us the word of
reconciliation

520 For Christ therefore we are ambassadors God as it were exhorting
by us for Christ we beseech you be reconciled to God

521 Him who knew no sin he hath made sin for us that we might be
made the justice of God in him

Sin for us  That is to be a sin offering a victim for sin



2 Corinthians Chapter 6


He exhorts them to a correspondence with Gods grace and not to
associate with unbelievers

61 And we helping do exhort you that you receive not the grace of God
in vain

62 For he saith In an accepted time have I heard thee and in the day
of salvation have I helped thee Behold now is the acceptable time
behold now is the day of salvation

63 Giving no offence to any man that our ministry be not blamed

64 But in all things let us exhibit ourselves as the ministers of
God in much patience in tribulation in necessities in distresses

65 In stripes in prisons in seditions in labours in watchings in
fastings

66 In chastity in knowledge in longsuffering in sweetness in the
Holy Ghost in charity unfeigned

67 In the word of truth in the power of God by the armour of
justice on the right hand and on the left

68 By honour and dishonour by evil report and good report as
deceivers and yet true as unknown and yet known

69 As dying and behold we live as chastised and not killed

610 As sorrowful yet always rejoicing as needy yet enriching many
as having nothing and possessing all things

611 Our mouth is open to you O ye Corinthians our heart is
enlarged

612 You are not straitened in us but in your own bowels you are
straitened

613 But having the same recompense I speak as to my children be
you also enlarged

614 Bear not the yoke with unbelievers For what participation hath
justice with injustice Or what fellowship hath light with darkness

615 And what concord hath Christ with Belial Or what part hath the
faithful with the unbeliever

616 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols For you are
the temple of the living God as God saith I will dwell in them and
walk among them And I will be their God and they shall be my people

617 Wherefore Go out from among them and be ye separate saith the
Lord and touch not the unclean thing

618 And I will receive you And will be a Father to you and you
shall be my sons and daughters saith the Lord Almighty



2 Corinthians Chapter 7


The apostles affection for the Corinthians His comfort and joy on
their account

71 Having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse
ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and of the spirit
perfecting sanctification in the fear of God

72 Receive us We have injured no man we have corrupted no man we
have overreached no man

73 I speak not this to your condemnation For we have said before
that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together

74 Great is my confidence for you great is my glorying for you I am
filled with comfort I exceedingly abound with joy in all our
tribulation

75 For also when we were come into Macedonia our flesh had no rest
but we suffered all tribulation Combats without fears within

76 But God who comforteth the humble comforted us by the coming of
Titus

77 And not by his coming only but also by the consolation wherewith
he was comforted in you relating to us your desire your mourning
your zeal for me so that I rejoiced the more

78 For although I made you sorrowful by my epistle I do not repent
And if I did repent seeing that the same epistle although but for a
time did make you sorrowful

79 Now I am glad not because you were made sorrowful but because
you were made sorrowful unto penance For you were made sorrowful
according to God that you might suffer damage by us in nothing

710 For the sorrow that is according to God worketh penance
steadfast unto salvation but the sorrow of the world worketh death

711 For behold this selfsame thing that you were made sorrowful
according to God how great carefulness it worketh in you yea defence
yea indignation yea fear yea desire yea zeal yea revenge In all
things you have shewed yourselves to be undefiled in the matter

712 Wherefore although I wrote to you it was not for his sake that
did the wrong nor for him that suffered it but to manifest our
carefulness that we have for you

713 Before God therefore we were comforted But in our consolation
we did the more abundantly rejoice for the joy of Titus because his
spirit was refreshed by you all

714 And if I have boasted any thing to him of you I have not been
put to shame but as we have spoken all things to you in truth so also
our boasting that was made to Titus is found a truth

715 And his bowels are more abundantly towards you remembering the
obedience of you all how with fear and trembling you received him

716 I rejoice that in all things I have confidence in you



2 Corinthians Chapter 8


He exhorts them to contribute bountifully to relieve the poor of
Jerusalem

81 Now we make known unto you brethren the grace of God that hath
been given in the churches of Macedonia

82 That in much experience of tribulation they have had abundance of
joy and their very deep poverty hath abounded unto the riches of their
simplicity

Simplicity  That is sincere bounty and charity

83 For according to their power I bear them witness and beyond
their power they were willing

84 With much entreaty begging of us the grace and communication of
the ministry that is done toward the saints

85 And not as we hoped but they gave their own selves first to the
Lord then to us by the will of God

86 Insomuch that we desired Titus that as he had begun so also he
would finish among you this same grace

87 That as in all things you abound in faith and word and knowledge
and all carefulness moreover also in your charity towards us so in
this grace also you may abound

88 I speak not as commanding but by the carefulness of others
approving also the good disposition of your charity

89 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that being rich
he became poor for your sakes that through his poverty you might be
rich

810 And herein I give my advice for this is profitable for you who
have begun not only to do but also to be willing a year ago

811 Now therefore perform ye it also in deed that as your mind is
forward to be willing so it may be also to perform out of that which
you have

812 For if the will be forward it is accepted according to that
which a man hath not according to that which he hath not

813 For I mean not that others should be eased and you burdened but
by an equality

814 In this present time let your abundance supply their want that
their abundance also may supply your want that there may be an
equality

815 As it is written He that had much had nothing over and he that
had little had no want

816 And thanks be to God who hath given the same carefulness for you
in the heart of Titus

817 For indeed he accepted the exhortation but being more careful
of his own will he went unto you

818 We have sent also with him the brother whose praise is in the
gospel through all the churches

819 And not that only but he was also ordained by the churches
companion of our travels for this grace which is administered by us
to the glory of the Lord and our determined will

820 Avoiding this lest any man should blame us in this abundance
which is administered by us

821 For we forecast what may be good not only before God but also
before men

822 And we have sent with them our brother also whom we have often
proved diligent in many things but now much more diligent with much
confidence in you

823 Either for Titus who is my companion and fellow labourer towards
you or our brethren the apostles of the churches the glory of
Christ

824 Wherefore shew ye to them in the sight of the churches the
evidence of your charity and of our boasting on your behalf



2 Corinthians Chapter 9


A further exhortation to almsgiving The fruits of it

91 For concerning the ministry that is done towards the saints it is
superfluous for me to write unto you

92 For I know your forward mind for which I boast of you to the
Macedonians that Achaia also is ready from the year past And your
emulation hath provoked very many

93 Now I have sent the brethren that the thing which we boast of
concerning you be not made void in this behalf that as I have said
you may be ready

94 Lest when the Macedonians shall come with me and find you
unprepared we not to say ye should be ashamed in this matter

95 Therefore I thought it necessary to desire the brethren that they
would go to you before and prepare this blessing before promised to be
ready so as a blessing not as covetousness

96 Now this I say He who soweth sparingly shall also reap sparingly
and he who soweth in blessings shall also reap blessings

97 Every one as he hath determined in his heart not with sadness or
of necessity for God loveth a cheerful giver

98 And God is able to make all grace abound in you that ye always
having all sufficiently in all things may abound to every good work

99 As it is written He hath dispersed abroad he hath given to the
poor his justice remaineth for ever

910 And he that ministereth seed to the sower will both give you
bread to eat and will multiply your seed and increase the growth of the
fruits of your justice

911 That being enriched in all things you may abound unto all
simplicity which worketh through us thanksgiving to God

912 Because the administration of this office doth not only supply
the want of the saints but aboundeth also by many thanksgivings in the
Lord

913 By the proof of this ministry glorifying God for the obedience
of your confession unto the gospel of Christ and for the simplicity of
your communicating unto them and unto all

914 And in their praying for you being desirous of you because of
the excellent grace of God in you

915 Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift



2 Corinthians Chapter 10


To stop the calumny and boasting of false apostles he set forth the
power of his apostleship

101 Now I Paul myself beseech you by the mildness and modesty of
Christ who in presence indeed am lowly among you but being absent am
bold toward you

102 But I beseech you that I may not be bold when I am present with
that confidence wherewith I am thought to be bold against some who
reckon us as if we walked according to the flesh

103 For though we walk in the flesh we do not war according to the
flesh

104 For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty to God
unto the pulling down of fortifications destroying counsels

105 And every height that exalteth itself against the knowledge of
God and bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience
of Christ

106 And having in readiness to revenge all disobedience when your
obedience shall be fulfilled

107 See the things that are according to outward appearance If any
man trust to himself that he is Christs let him think this again with
himself that as he is Christs so are we also

108 For if also I should boast somewhat more of our power which the
Lord hath given us unto edification and not for your destruction I
should not be ashamed

109 But that I may not be thought as it were to terrify you by
epistles

1010 For his epistles indeed say they are weighty and strong but
his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible

1011 Let such a one think this that such as we are in word by
epistles when absent such also we will be indeed when present

1012 For we dare not match or compare ourselves with some that
commend themselves but we measure ourselves by ourselves and compare
ourselves with ourselves

1013 But we will not glory beyond our measure but according to the
measure of the rule which God hath measured to us a measure to reach
even unto you

1014 For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure as if we
reached not unto you For we are come as far as to you in the Gospel of
Christ

1015 Not glorying beyond measure in other mens labours but having
hope of your increasing faith to be magnified in you according to our
rule abundantly

1016 Yea unto those places that are beyond you to preach the gospel
not to glory in another mans rule in those things that are made ready
to our hand

1017 But he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord

1018 For not he who commendeth himself is approved but he whom God
commendeth



2 Corinthians Chapter 11


He is forced to commend himself and his labours lest the Corinthians
should be imposed upon by the false apostles

111 Would to God you could bear with some little of my folly But do
bear with me

My folly  So he calls his reciting his own praises which commonly
speaking is looked upon as a piece of folly and vanity though the
apostle was constrained to do it for the good of the souls committed
to his charge

112 For I am jealous of you with the jealousy of God For I have
espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin
to Christ

113 But I fear lest as the serpent seduced Eve by his subtilty so
your minds should be corrupted and fall from the simplicity that is in
Christ

114 For if he that cometh preacheth another Christ whom we have not
preached or if you receive another Spirit whom you have not received
or another gospel which you have not received you might well bear
with him

115 For I suppose that I have done nothing less than the great
apostles

116 For although I be rude in speech yet not in knowledge but in
all things we have been made manifest to you

117 Or did I commit a fault humbling myself that you might be
exalted because I preached unto you the Gospel of God freely

118 I have taken from other churches receiving wages of them for
your ministry

119 And when I was present with you and wanted I was chargeable to
no man for that which was wanting to me the brethren supplied who
came from Macedonia And in all things I have kept myself from being
burthensome to you and so I will keep myself

1110 The truth of Christ is in me that this glorying shall not be
broken off in me in the regions of Achaia

1111 Wherefore Because I love you not God knoweth it

1112 But what I do that I will do that I may cut off the occasion
from them that desire occasion that wherein they glory they may be
found even as we

1113 For such false apostles are deceitful workmen transforming
themselves into the apostles of Christ

1114 And no wonder for Satan himself transformeth himself into an
angel of light

1115 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers be transformed
as the ministers of justice whose end shall be according to their
works

1116 I say again Let no man think me to be foolish otherwise take
me as one foolish that I also may glory a little

1117 That which I speak I speak not according to God but as it were
in foolishness in this matter of glorying

1118 Seeing that many glory according to the flesh I will glory
also

1119 For you gladly suffer the foolish whereas yourselves are wise

1120 For you suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour
you if a man take from you if a man be lifted up if a man strike you
on the face

1121 I seek according to dishonour as if we had been weak in this
part Wherein if any man dare I speak foolishly I dare also

1122 They are Hebrews so am I They are Israelites so am I They
are the seed of Abraham so am I

1123 They are the ministers of Christ I speak as one less wise I
am more in many more labours in prisons more frequently in stripes
above measure in deaths often

1124 Of the Jews five times did I receive forty stripes save one

1125 Thrice was I beaten with rods once I was stoned thrice I
suffered shipwreck a night and a day I was in the depth of the sea

1126 In journeying often in perils of waters in perils of robbers
in perils from my own nation in perils from the Gentiles in perils in
the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils
from false brethren

1127 In labour and painfulness in much watchings in hunger and
thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness

1128 Besides those things which are without my daily instance the
solicitude for all the churches

My daily instance  The labours that come in and press upon me every
day

1129 Who is weak and I am not weak Who is scandalized and I am not
on fire

1130 If I must needs glory I will glory of the things that concern
my infirmity

1131 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who is blessed for
ever knoweth that I lie not

1132 At Damascus the governor of the nation under Aretas the king
guarded the city of the Damascenes to apprehend me

1133 And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall and
so escaped his hands



2 Corinthians Chapter 12


His raptures and revelations His being buffeted by Satan His fear for
the Corinthians

121 If I must glory it is not expedient indeed but I will come to
visions and revelations of the Lord

122 I know a man in Christ above fourteen years ago whether in the
body I know not or out of the body I know not God knoweth such a
one caught up to the third heaven

123 And I know such a man whether in the body or out of the body I
know not God knoweth

124 That he was caught up into paradise and heard secret words which
it is not granted to man to utter

125 For such an one I will glory but for myself I will glory nothing
but in my infirmities

126 For though I should have a mind to glory I shall not be foolish
for I will say the truth But I forbear lest any man should think of
me above that which he seeth in me or any thing he heareth from me

127 And lest the greatness of the revelations should exalt me there
was given me a sting of my flesh an angel of Satan to buffet me

128 For which thing thrice I besought the Lord that it might depart
from me

129 And he said to me My grace is sufficient for thee for power is
made perfect in infirmity Gladly therefore will I glory in my
infirmities that the power of Christ may dwell in me

Power is made perfect  The strength and power of God more perfectly
shines forth in our weakness and infirmity as the more weak we are of
ourselves the more illustrious is his grace in supporting us and
giving us the victory under all trials and conflicts

1210 For which cause I please myself in my infirmities in
reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distresses for Christ
For when I am weak then am I powerful

1211 I am become foolish You have compelled me for I ought to have
been commended by you For I have no way come short of them that are
above measure apostles although I be nothing

1212 Yet the signs of my apostleship have been wrought on you in all
patience in signs and wonders and mighty deeds

1213 For what is there that you have had less than the other churches
but that I myself was not burthensome to you Pardon me this injury

1214 Behold now the third time I am ready to come to you and I will
not be burthensome unto you For I seek not the things that are yours
but you For neither ought the children to lay up for the parents but
the parents for the children

1215 But I most gladly will spend and be spent myself for your souls
although loving you more I be loved less

1216 But be it so I did not burthen you but being crafty I caught
you by guile

1217 Did I overreach you by any of them whom I sent to you

1218 I desired Titus and I sent with him a brother Did Titus
overreach you Did we not walk with the same spirit Did we not in the
same steps

1219 Of old think you that we excuse ourselves to you We speak
before God in Christ but all things my dearly beloved for your
edification

1220 For I fear lest perhaps when I come I shall not find you such
as I would and that I shall be found by you such as you would not
Lest perhaps contentions envyings animosities dissensions
detractions whisperings swellings seditions be among you

1221 Lest again when I come God humble me among you and I mourn
many of them that sinned before and have not done penance for the
uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness that they have
committed



2 Corinthians Chapter 13


He threatens the impenitent to provoke them to penance

131 Behold this is the third time I am coming to you In the mouth
of two or three witnesses shall every word stand

132 I have told before and foretell as present and now absent to
them that sinned before and to all the rest that if I come again I
will not spare

133 Do you seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me who towards
you is not weak but is mighty in you

134 For although he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by
the power of God For we also are weak in him but we shall live with
him by the power of God towards you

135 Try your own selves if you be in the faith prove ye yourselves
Know you not your own selves that Christ Jesus is in you unless
perhaps you be reprobates

136 But I trust that you shall know that we are not reprobates

137 Now we pray God that you may do no evil not that we may appear
approved but that you may do that which is good and that we may be as
reprobates

Reprobates  that is without proof by having no occasion of shewing
our power in punishing you

138 For we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth

139 For we rejoice that we are weak and you are strong This also we
pray for your perfection

1310 Therefore I write these things being absent that being
present I may not deal more severely according to the power which the
Lord hath given me unto edification and not unto destruction

1311 For the rest brethren rejoice be perfect take exhortation
be of one mind have peace And the God of grace and of love shall be
with you

1312 Salute one another with a holy kiss All the saints salute you

1313 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the charity of God and
the communication of the Holy Ghost be with you all Amen




THE EPISTLE OF ST PAUL TO THE GALATIANS



The Galatians soon after St Paul had preached the Gospel to them
were seduced by some false teachers who had been Jews and who were for
obliging all Christians even those who had been Gentiles to observe
circumcision and the other ceremonies of the Mosaical law In this
Epistle he refutes the pernicious doctrine of those teachers and also
their calumny against his mission and apostleship The subject matter
of this Epistle is much the same as that to the Romans It was written
at Ephesus about twentythree years after our Lords Ascension



Galatians Chapter 1


He blames the Galatians for suffering themselves to be imposed upon by
new teachers The apostles calling

11 Paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by Jesus Christ
and God the Father who raised him from the dead

12 And all the brethren who are with me to the churches of Galatia

13 Grace be to you and peace from God the Father and from our Lord
Jesus Christ

14 Who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this
present wicked world according to the will of God and our Father

15 To whom is glory for ever and ever Amen

16 I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you
into the grace of Christ unto another gospel

17 Which is not another only there are some that trouble you and
would pervert the gospel of Christ

18 But though we or an angel from heaven preach a gospel to you
besides that which we have preached to you let him be anathema

19 As we said before so now I say again If any one preach to you a
gospel besides that which you have received let him be anathema

110 For do I now persuade men or God Or do I seek to please men If
I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of Christ

111 For I give you to understand brethren that the gospel which was
preached by me is not according to man

112 For neither did I receive it of man nor did I learn it but by
the revelation of Jesus Christ

113 For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews
religion how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God and
wasted it

114 And I made progress in the Jews religion above many of my equals
in my own nation being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of
my fathers

115 But when it pleased him who separated me from my mothers womb
and called me by his grace

116 To reveal his Son in me that I might preach him among the
Gentiles immediately I condescended not to flesh and blood

117 Neither went I to Jerusalem to the apostles who were before me
but I went into Arabia and again I returned to Damascus

118 Then after three years I went to Jerusalem to see Peter and I
tarried with him fifteen days

119 But other of the apostles I saw none saving James the brother of
the Lord

120 Now the things which I write to you behold before God I lie
not

121 Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia

122 And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in
Christ

123 But they had heard only He who persecuted us in times past doth
now preach the faith which once he impugned

124 And they glorified God in me



Galatians Chapter 2


The apostles preaching was approved of by the other apostles The
Gentiles were not to be constrained to the observance of the law

21 Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with
Barnabas taking Titus also with me

22 And I went up according to revelation and communicated to them the
gospel which I preach among the Gentiles but apart to them who seemed
to be some thing lest perhaps I should run or had run in vain

23 But neither Titus who was with me being a Gentile was compelled
to be circumcised

24 But because of false brethren unawares brought in who came in
privately to spy our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus that they
might bring us into servitude

25 To whom we yielded not by subjection no not for an hour that
the truth of the gospel might continue with you

26 But of them who seemed to be some thing what they were some time
it is nothing to me God accepteth not the person of man for to me
they that seemed to be some thing added nothing

27 But contrariwise when they had seen that to me was committed the
gospel of the uncircumcision as to Peter was that of the circumcision

The gospel of the uncircumcision  The preaching of the gospel to the
uncircumcised that is to the Gentiles St Paul was called in an
extraordinary manner to be the apostle of the Gentiles St Peter
besides his general commission over the whole flock John 21 15
etc had a peculiar charge of the people of the circumcision that
is of the Jews

28 For he who wrought in Peter to the apostleship of the
circumcision wrought in me also among the Gentiles

29 And when they had known the grace that was given to me James and
Cephas and John who seemed to be pillars gave to me and Barnabas the
right hands of fellowship that we should go unto the Gentiles and
they unto the circumcision

210 Only that we should be mindful of the poor which same thing also
I was careful to do

211 But when Cephas was come to Antioch I withstood him to the face
because he was to be blamed

I withstood etc  The fault that is here noted in the conduct of St
Peter was only a certain imprudence in withdrawing himself from the
table of the Gentiles for fear of giving offence to the Jewish
converts but this in such circumstances when his so doing might be
of ill consequence to the Gentiles who might be induced thereby to
think themselves obliged to conform to the Jewish way of living to the
prejudice of their Christian liberty Neither was St Pauls
reprehending him any argument against his supremacy for in such cases
an inferior may and sometimes ought with respect to admonish his
superior

212 For before that some came from James he did eat with the
Gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself
fearing them who were of the circumcision

213 And to his dissimulation the rest of the Jews consented so that
Barnabas also was led by them into that dissimulation

214 But when I saw that they walked not uprightly unto the truth of
the gospel I said to Cephas before them all If thou being a Jew
livest after the manner of the Gentiles and not as the Jews do how
dost thou compel the Gentiles to live as do the Jews

215 We by nature are Jews and not of the Gentiles sinners

216 But knowing that man is not justified by the works of the law
but by the faith of Jesus Christ we also believe in Christ Jesus that
we may be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the
law because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified

217 But if while we seek to be justified in Christ we ourselves
also are found sinners is Christ then the minister of sin God forbid

218 For if I build up again the things which I have destroyed I make
myself a prevaricator

219 For I through the law am dead to the law that I may live to
God with Christ I am nailed to the cross

220 And I live now not I but Christ liveth in me And that I live
now in the flesh I live in the faith of the Son of God who loved me
and delivered himself for me

221 I cast not away the grace of God For if justice be by the law
then Christ died in vain



Galatians Chapter 3


The Spirit and the blessing promised to Abraham cometh not by the law
but by faith

31 O senseless Galatians who hath bewitched you that you should not
obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been set forth
crucified among you

32 This only would I learn of you Did you receive the Spirit by the
works of the law or by the hearing of faith

33 Are you so foolish that whereas you began in the Spirit you
would now be made perfect by the flesh

34 Have you suffered so great things in vain If it be yet in vain

35 He therefore who giveth to you the Spirit and worketh miracles
among you doth he do it by the works of the law or by the hearing of
the faith

36 As it is written Abraham believed God and it was reputed to him
unto justice

37 Know ye therefore that they who are of faith the same are the
children of Abraham

38 And the scripture foreseeing that God justifieth the Gentiles by
faith told unto Abraham before In thee shall all nations be blessed

39 Therefore they that are of faith shall be blessed with faithful
Abraham

310 For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse For
it is written Cursed is every one that abideth not in all things
which are written in the book of the law to do them

311 But that in the law no man is justified with God it is manifest
because the just man liveth by faith

312 But the law is not of faith but he that doth those things shall
live in them

313 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a
curse for us for it is written Cursed is every one that hangeth on a
tree

314 That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through
Christ Jesus that we may receive the promise of the Spirit by faith

315 Brethren I speak after the manner of man yet a mans
testament if it be confirmed no man despiseth nor addeth to it

316 To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed He saith not
And to his seeds as of many But as of one And to thy seed which is
Christ

317 Now this I say that the testament which was confirmed by God
the law which was made after four hundred and thirty years doth not
disannul to make the promise of no effect

318 For if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise
But God gave it to Abraham by promise

319 Why then was the law It was set because of transgressions until
the seed should come to whom he made the promise being ordained by
angels in the hand of a mediator

Because of transgressions  To restrain them from sin by fear and
threats Ordained by angels  The law was delivered by angels
speaking in the name and person of God to Moses who was the mediator
on this occasion between God and the people

320 Now a mediator is not of one but God is one

321 Was the law then against the promises of God God forbid For if
there had been a law given which could give life verily justice should
have been by the law

322 But the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise
by the faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe

Hath concluded all under sin  that is hath declared all to be under
sin from which they could not be delivered but by faith in Jesus
Christ the promised seed

323 But before the faith came we were kept under the law shut up
unto that faith which was to be revealed

324 Wherefore the law was our pedagogue in Christ that we might be
justified by faith

Pedagogue  That is schoolmaster conductor or instructor

325 But after the faith is come we are no longer under a pedagogue

326 For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus

327 For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ have put on
Christ

328 There is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free
there is neither male nor female For you are all one in Christ Jesus

Neither Jew etc  That is no distinction of Jew etc

329 And if you be Christs then are you the seed of Abraham heirs
according to the promise



Galatians Chapter 4


Christ has freed us from the servitude of the law We are the freeborn
sons of Abraham

41 As long as the heir is a child he differeth nothing from a
servant though he be lord of all

42 But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the
father

43 So we also when we were children were serving under the elements
of the world

Under the elements etc  That is under the first rudiments of
religion in which the carnal Jews were trained up or under those
corporeal creatures used in their manifold rites sacrifices and
sacraments

44 But when the fulness of the time was come God sent his Son made
of a woman made under the law

45 That he might redeem them who were under the law that we might
receive the adoption of sons

46 And because you are sons God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into
your hearts crying Abba Father

47 Therefore now he is not a servant but a son And if a son an
heir also through God

48 But then indeed not knowing God you served them who by nature
are not gods

49 But now after that you have known God or rather are known by
God how turn you again to the weak and needy elements which you desire
to serve again

410 You observe days and months and times and years

You observe days etc  He speaks not of the observation of the Lords
day or other Christian festivals but either of the superstitious
observation of days lucky and unlucky or else of the Jewish festivals
to the observance of which certain Jewish teachers sought to induce
the Galatians

411 I am afraid of you lest perhaps I have laboured in vain among
you

412 Be ye as I because I also am as you brethren I beseech you You
have not injured me at all

413 And you know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the
gospel to you heretofore and your temptation in my flesh

414 You despised not nor rejected but received me as an angel of
God even as Christ Jesus

415 Where is then your blessedness For I bear you witness that if
it could be done you would have plucked out your own eyes and would
have given them to me

416 Am I then become your enemy because I tell you the truth

417 They are zealous in your regard not well but they would exclude
you that you might be zealous for them

418 But be zealous for that which is good in a good thing always and
not only when I am present with you

419 My little children of whom I am in labour again until Christ be
formed in you

420 And I would willingly be present with you now and change my
voice because I am ashamed for you

421 Tell me you that desire to be under the law have you not read
the law

422 For it is written that Abraham had two sons the one by a
bondwoman and the other by a free woman

423 But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh
but he of the free woman was by promise

424 Which things are said by an allegory For these are the two
testaments The one from Mount Sina engendering unto bondage which is
Agar

425 For Sina is a mountain in Arabia which hath affinity to that
Jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children

426 But that Jerusalem which is above is free which is our mother

427 For it is written Rejoice thou barren that bearest not break
forth and cry thou that travailest not for many are the children of
the desolate more than of her that hath a husband

428 Now we brethren as Isaac was are the children of promise

429 But as then he that was born according to the flesh persecuted
him that was after the spirit so also it is now

430 But what saith the scripture Cast out the bondwoman and her son
for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free
woman

431 So then brethren we are not the children of the bondwoman but
of the free by the freedom wherewith Christ has made us free



Galatians Chapter 5


He exhorts them to stand to their Christian liberty Of the fruits of
the flesh and of the spirit

51 Stand fast and be not held again under the yoke of bondage

52 Behold I Paul tell you that if you be circumcised Christ shall
profit you nothing

53 And I testify again to every man circumcising himself that he is a
debtor to do the whole law

54 You are made void of Christ you who are justified in the law you
are fallen from grace

55 For we in spirit by faith wait for the hope of justice

56 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor
uncircumcision but faith that worketh by Charity

57 You did run well What hath hindered you that you should not obey
the truth

58 This persuasion is not from him that calleth you

59 A little leaven corrupteth the whole lump

510 I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will not be of
another mind but he that troubleth you shall bear the judgment
whosoever he be

511 And I brethren if I yet preach circumcision why do I yet
suffer persecution Then is the scandal of the cross made void

512 I would they were even cut off who trouble you

513 For you brethren have been called unto liberty Only make not
liberty an occasion to the flesh but by charity of the spirit serve
one another

514 For all the law is fulfilled in one word Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself

515 But if you bite and devour one another take heed you be not
consumed one of another

516 I say then Walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the
lusts of the flesh

517 For the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against
the flesh For these are contrary one to another so that you do not
the things that you would

518 But if you are led by the spirit you are not under the law

519 Now the works of the flesh are manifest which are fornication
uncleanness immodesty luxury

520 Idolatry witchcrafts enmities contentions emulations wraths
quarrels dissensions sects

521 Envies murders drunkenness revellings and such like Of the
which I foretell you as I have foretold to you that they who do such
things shall not obtain the kingdom of God

522 But the fruit of the Spirit is charity joy peace patience
benignity goodness longanimity

523 Mildness faith modesty continency chastity Against such
there is no law

524 And they that are Christs have crucified their flesh with the
vices and concupiscences

525 If we live in the Spirit let us also walk in the Spirit

526 Let us not be made desirous of vain glory provoking one another
envying one another



Galatians Chapter 6


He exhorts to charity humility and all virtue He glories in nothing
but in the cross of Christ

61 Brethren and if a man be overtaken in any fault you who are
spiritual instruct such a one in the spirit of meekness considering
thyself lest thou also be tempted

62 Bear ye one anothers burdens and so you shall fulfil the law of
Christ

63 For if any man think himself to be some thing whereas he is
nothing he deceiveth himself

64 But let every one prove his own work and so he shall have glory
in himself only and not in another

65 For every one shall bear his own burden

66 And let him that is instructed in the word communicate to him that
instructeth him in all good things

67 Be not deceived God is not mocked

68 For what things a man shall sow those also shall he reap For he
that soweth in his flesh of the flesh also shall reap corruption But
he that soweth in the spirit of the spirit shall reap life everlasting

69 And in doing good let us not fail For in due time we shall reap
not failing

610 Therefore whilst we have time let us work good to all men but
especially to those who are of the household of the faith

611 See what a letter I have written to you with my own hand

612 For as many as desire to please in the flesh they constrain you
to be circumcised only that they may not suffer the persecution of the
cross of Christ

613 For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law but
they will have you to be circumcised that they may glory in your
flesh

614 But God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord
Jesus Christ by whom the world is crucified to me and I to the world

615 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor
uncircumcision but a new creature

616 And whosoever shall follow this rule peace on them and mercy
and upon the Israel of God

617 From henceforth let no man be troublesome to me for I bear the
marks of the Lord Jesus in my body

618 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit brethren
Amen




THE EPISTLE OF ST PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS



Ephesus was the capital of Lesser Asia and celebrated for the temple
of Diana to which the most part of the people of the East went
frequently to worship But St Paul having preached the Gospel there
for two years the first time and afterwards for about a year converted
many He wrote this Epistle to them when he was a prisoner in Rome and
sent it by Tychicus He admonishes them to hold firmly the faith which
they had received and warns them and also those of the neighbouring
cities against the sophistry of philosophers and doctrine of false
teachers who were come among them The matters of faith contained in
this Epistle are exceedingly sublime and consequently very difficult
to be understood It was written about twentynine years after our
Lords Ascension



Ephesians Chapter 1


The great blessings we have received through Christ He is the head of
all the church

11 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to all the
saints who are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus

12 Grace be to you and peace from God the Father and from the Lord
Jesus Christ

13 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath
blessed us with spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ

In heavenly places  or in heavenly things In coelestibus

14 As he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we
should be holy and unspotted in his sight in charity

15 Who hath predestinated us unto the adoption of children through
Jesus Christ unto himself according to the purpose of his will

16 Unto the praise of the glory of his grace in which he hath graced
us in his beloved son

17 In whom we have redemption through his blood the remission of
sins according to the riches of his grace

18 Which hath superabounded in us in all wisdom and prudence

19 That he might make known unto us the mystery of his will
according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in him

110 In the dispensation of the fulness of times to reestablish all
things in Christ that are in heaven and on earth in him

111 In whom we also are called by lot being predestinated according
to the purpose of him who worketh all things according to the counsel
of his will

112 That we may be unto the praise of his glory we who before hoped
in Christ

113 In whom you also after you had heard the word of truth the
gospel of your salvation in whom also believing you were signed with
the holy Spirit of promise

114 Who is the pledge of our inheritance unto the redemption of
acquisition unto the praise of his glory

Acquisition  that is a purchased possession

115 Wherefore I also hearing of your faith that is in the Lord
Jesus and of your love towards all the saints

116 Cease not to give thanks for you making commemoration of you in
my prayers

117 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ the Father of glory may
give unto you the spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge
of him

118 The eyes of your heart enlightened that you may know what the
hope is of his calling and what are the riches of the glory of his
inheritance in the saints

119 And what is the exceeding greatness of his power towards us who
believe according to the operation of the might of his power

120 Which he wrought in Christ raising him up from the dead and
setting him on his right hand in the heavenly places

121 Above all principality and power and virtue and dominion and
every name that is named not only in this world but also in that
which is to come

122 And he hath subjected all things under his feet and hath made him
head over all the church

123 Which is his body and the fulness of him who is filled all in
all



Ephesians Chapter 2


All our good comes through Christ He is our peace

21 And you when you were dead in your offences and sins

22 Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this
world according to the prince of the power of this air of the spirit
that now worketh on the children of unbelief

23 In which also we all conversed in time past in the desires of our
flesh fulfilling the will of the flesh and of our thoughts and were
by nature children of wrath even as the rest

24 But God who is rich in mercy for his exceeding charity wherewith
he loved us

25 Even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together in
Christ by whose grace you are saved

26 And hath raised us up together and hath made us sit together in
the heavenly places through Christ Jesus

27 That he might shew in the ages to come the abundant riches of his
grace in his bounty towards us in Christ Jesus

28 For by grace you are saved through faith and that not of
yourselves for it is the gift of God

29 Not of works that no man may glory

Not of works  as of our own growth or from ourselves but as from
the grace of God

210 For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus in good
works which God hath prepared that we should walk in them

211 For which cause be mindful that you being heretofore gentiles is
the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called
circumcision in the flesh made by hands

212 That you were at that time without Christ being aliens from the
conversation of Israel and strangers to the testament having no hope
of the promise and without God in this world

213 But now in Christ Jesus you who some time were afar off are
made nigh by the blood of Christ

214 For he is our peace who hath made both one and breaking down
the middle wall of partition the enmities in his flesh

215 Making void the law of commandments contained in decrees that he
might make the two in himself into one new man making peace

216 And might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross killing
the enmities in himself

217 And coming he preached peace to you that were afar off and
peace to them that were nigh

218 For by him we have access both in one Spirit to the Father

219 Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but you
are fellow citizens with the saints and the domestics of God

220 Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus
Christ himself being the chief corner stone

221 In whom all the building being framed together groweth up into
an holy temple in the Lord

222 In whom you also are built together into an habitation of God in
the Spirit



Ephesians Chapter 3


The mystery hidden from former ages was discovered to the apostle to
be imparted to the Gentiles He prays that they may be strengthened in
God

31 For this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you
Gentiles

32 If yet you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God
which is given me towards you

33 How that according to revelation the mystery has been made known
to me as I have written above in a few words

34 As you reading may understand my knowledge in the mystery of
Christ

35 Which in other generations was not known to the sons of men as it
is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit

36 That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and
copartners of his promise in Christ Jesus by the gospel

37 Of which I am made a minister according to the gift of the grace
of God which is given to me according to the operation of his power

38 To me the least of all the saints is given this grace to preach
among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ

39 And to enlighten all men that they may see what is the
dispensation of the mystery which hath been hidden from eternity in God
who created all things

310 That the manifold wisdom of God may be made known to the
principalities and powers in heavenly places through the church

311 According to the eternal purpose which he made in Christ Jesus
our Lord

312 In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith
of him

313 Wherefore I pray you not to faint at my tribulations for you
which is your glory

314 For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ

315 Of whom all paternity in heaven and earth is named

All paternity  Or the whole family God is the Father both of
angels and men whosoever besides is named father is so named with
subordination to him

316 That he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to
be strengthened by his Spirit with might unto the inward man

317 That Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts that being rooted
and founded in charity

318 You may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the
breadth and length and height and depth

319 To know also the charity of Christ which surpasseth all
knowledge that you may be filled unto all the fulness of God

320 Now to him who is able to do all things more abundantly than we
desire or understand according to the power that worketh in us

321 To him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all
generations world without end Amen



Ephesians Chapter 4


He exhorts them to unity to put on the new man and to fly sin

41 I therefore a prisoner in the Lord beseech you that you walk
worthy of the vocation in which you are called

42 With all humility and mildness with patience supporting one
another in charity

43 Careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace

44 One body and one Spirit as you are called in one hope of your
calling

45 One Lord one faith one baptism

46 One God and Father of all who is above all and through all and
in us all

47 But to every one of us is given grace according to the measure of
the giving of Christ

48 Wherefore he saith Ascending on high he led captivity captive
he gave gifts to men

49 Now that he ascended what is it but because he also descended
first into the lower parts of the earth

410 He that descended is the same also that ascended above all the
heavens that he might fill all things

411 And he gave some apostles and some prophets and other some
evangelists and other some pastors and doctors

Gave some apostlesUntil we all meet etc  Here it is plainly
expressed that Christ has left in his church a perpetual succession of
orthodox pastors and teachers to preserve the faithful in unity and
truth

412 For the perfecting of the saints for the word of the ministry
for the edifying of the body of Christ

413 Until we all meet into the unity of faith and of the knowledge of
the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the age of the
fulness of Christ

414 That henceforth we be no more children tossed to and fro and
carried about with every wind of doctrine by the wickedness of men by
cunning craftiness by which they lie in wait to deceive

415 But doing the truth in charity we may in all things grow up in
him who is the head even Christ

416 From whom the whole body being compacted and fitly joined
together by what every joint supplieth according to the operation in
the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the
edifying of itself in charity

417 This then I say and testify in the Lord That henceforward you
walk not as also the Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind

418 Having their understanding darkened being alienated from the
life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the
blindness of their hearts

419 Who despairing have given themselves up to lasciviousness unto
the working of all uncleanness unto covetousness

420 But you have not so learned Christ

421 If so be that you have heard him and have been taught in him as
the truth is in Jesus

422 To put off according to former conversation the old man who is
corrupted according to the desire of error

423 And be renewed in spirit of your mind

424 And put on the new man who according to God is created in
justice and holiness of truth

425 Wherefore putting away lying speak ye the truth every man with
his neighbour For we are members one of another

426 Be angry and sin not Let not the sun go down upon your anger

427 Give not place to the devil

428 He that stole let him now steal no more but rather let him
labour working with his hands the thing which is good that he may
have something to give to him that suffereth need

429 Let no evil speech proceed from your mouth but that which is
good to the edification of faith that it may administer grace to the
hearers

430 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed
unto the day of redemption

431 Let all bitterness and anger and indignation and clamour and
blasphemy be put away from you with all malice

432 And be ye kind one to another merciful forgiving one another
even as God hath forgiven you in Christ



Ephesians Chapter 5


Exhortations to a virtuous life The mutual duties of man and wife by
the example of Christ and of the Church

51 Be ye therefore followers of God as most dear children

52 And walk in love as Christ also hath loved us and hath delivered
himself for us an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odour of
sweetness

53 But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not so
much as be named among you as becometh saints

54 Or obscenity or foolish talking or scurrility which is to no
purpose but rather giving of thanks

55 For know you this and understand That no fornicator or unclean or
covetous person which is a serving of idols hath inheritance in the
kingdom of Christ and of God

56 Let no man deceive you with vain words For because of these
things cometh the anger of God upon the children of unbelief

57 Be ye not therefore partakers with them

58 For you were heretofore darkness but now light in the Lord Walk
then as children of the light

59 For the fruit of the light is in all goodness and justice and
truth

510 Proving what is well pleasing to God

511 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but
rather reprove them

512 For the things that are done by them in secret it is a shame
even to speak of

513 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light
for all that is made manifest is light

514 Wherefore he saith Rise thou that sleepest and arise from the
dead and Christ shall enlighten thee

515 See therefore brethren how you walk circumspectly not as
unwise

516 But as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil

517 Wherefore become not unwise but understanding what is the will
of God

518 And be not drunk with wine wherein is luxury but be ye filled
with the Holy Spirit

519 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual
canticles singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord

520 Giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ to God and the Father

521 Being subject one to another in the fear of Christ

522 Let women be subject to their husbands as to the Lord

523 Because the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the
head of the church He is the saviour of his body

524 Therefore as the church is subject to Christ so also let the
wives be to their husbands in all things

As the church is subject to Christ  The church then according to St
Paul is ever obedient to Christ and can never fall from him but
remain faithful to him unspotted and unchanged to the end of the
world

525 Husbands love your wives as Christ also loved the church and
delivered himself up for it

526 That he might sanctify it cleansing it by the laver of water in
the word of life

527 That he might present it to himself a glorious church not
having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy
and without blemish

528 So also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies He
that loveth his wife loveth himself

529 For no man ever hated his own flesh but nourisheth and
cherisheth it as also Christ doth the church

530 Because we are members of him body of his flesh and of his
bones

531 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall
cleave to his wife And they shall be two in one flesh

532 This is a great sacrament but I speak in Christ and in the
church

533 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular love for his
wife as himself And let the wife fear her husband



Ephesians Chapter 6


Duties of children and servants The Christians armour

61 Children obey your parents in the Lord for this is just

62 Honour thy father and thy mother which is the first commandment
with a promise

63 That it may be well with thee and thou mayest be long lived upon
earth

64 And you fathers provoke not your children to anger but bring
them up in the discipline and correction of the Lord

65 Servants be obedient to them that are your lords according to the
flesh with fear and trembling in the simplicity of your heart as to
Christ

66 Not serving to the eye as it were pleasing men but as the
servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart

67 With a good will serving as to the Lord and not to men

68 Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man shall do the same
shall he receive from the Lord whether he be bond or free

69 And you masters do the same things to them forbearing
threatenings knowing that the Lord both of them and you is in heaven
And there is no respect of persons with him

610 Finally brethren be strengthened in the Lord and in the might
of his power

611 Put you on the armour of God that you may be able to stand
against the deceits of the devil

612 For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood but against
principalities and powers against the rulers of the world of this
darkness against the spirits of wickedness in the high places

High places or heavenly places  That is to say in the air the
lowest of the celestial regions in which God permits these wicked
spirits or fallen angels to wander

613 Therefore take unto you the armour of God that you may be able
to resist in the evil day and to stand in all things perfect

614 Stand therefore having your loins girt about with truth and
having on the breastplate of justice

615 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace

616 In all things taking the shield of faith wherewith you may be
able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the most wicked one

617 And take unto you the helmet of salvation and the sword of the
Spirit which is the word of God

618 By all prayer and supplication praying at all times in the
spirit and in the same watching with all instance and supplication for
all the saints

619 And for me that speech may be given me that I may open my mouth
with confidence to make known the mystery of the gospel

620 For which I am an ambassador in a chain so that therein I may be
bold to speak according as I ought

621 But that you also may know the things that concern me and what I
am doing Tychicus my dearest brother and faithful minister in the
Lord will make known to you all things

622 Whom I have sent to you for this same purpose that you may know
the things concerning us and that he may comfort your hearts

623 Peace be to the brethren and charity with faith from God the
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ

624 Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in
incorruption Amen

In incorruption  That is with a pure and perfect love




THE EPISTLE OF ST PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS



The Philippians were the first among the Macedonians converted to the
faith They had a great veneration for St Paul and supplied his wants
when he was a prisoner in Rome sending to him by Epaphroditus by whom
he sent this Epistle in which he recommends charity unity and
humility and warns them against false teachers whom he calls dogs and
enemies of the cross of Christ He also returns thanks for their
benefactions It was written about twentynine years after our Lords
Ascension



Philippians Chapter 1


The apostles affection for the Philippians

11 Paul and Timothy the servants of Jesus Christ to all the saints
in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi with the bishops and deacons

12 Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord
Jesus Christ

13 I give thanks to my God in every remembrance of you

14 Always in all my prayers making supplication for you all with joy

15 For your communication in the gospel of Christ from the first day
unto now

16 Being confident of this very thing that he who hath begun a good
work in you will perfect it unto the day of Christ Jesus

17 As it is meet for me to think this for you all for that I have
you in my heart and that in my bands and in the defence and
confirmation of the gospel you all are partakers of my joy

18 For God is my witness how I long after you all in the bowels of
Jesus Christ

19 And this I pray That your charity may more and more abound in
knowledge and in all understanding

110 That you may approve the better things that you may be sincere
and without offence unto the day of Christ

111 Filled with the fruit of justice through Jesus Christ unto the
glory and praise of God

112 Now brethren I desire you should know that the things which
have happened to me have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the
gospel

113 So that my bands are made manifest in Christ in all the court
and in all other places

114 And many of the brethren in the Lord growing confident by my
bands are much more bold to speak the word of God without fear

115 Some indeed even out of envy and contention but some also for
good will preach Christ

116 Some out of charity knowing that I am set for the defence of the
gospel

117 And some out of contention preach Christ not sincerely supposing
that they raise affliction to my bands

118 But what then So that by all means whether by occasion or by
truth Christ be preached in this also I rejoice yea and will
rejoice

119 For I know that this shall fall out to me unto salvation through
your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ

120 According to my expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be
confounded but with all confidence as always so now also shall
Christ be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death

121 For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain

122 And if to live in the flesh this is to me the fruit of labour
And what I shall choose I know not

This is to me etc  His meaning is that although his dying
immediately for Christ would be his gain by putting him presently in
possession of heaven yet he is doubtful what he should choose because
by staying longer in the flesh he should be more beneficial to the
souls of his neighbours

123 But I am straitened between two having a desire to be dissolved
and to be with Christ a thing by far the better

124 But to abide still in the flesh is needful for you

125 And having this confidence I know that I shall abide and
continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith

126 That your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus for me by my
coming to you again

127 Only let your conversation be worthy of the gospel of Christ
that whether I come and see you or being absent may hear of you
that you stand fast in one spirit with one mind labouring together for
the faith of the gospel

128 And in nothing be ye terrified by the adversaries which to them
is a cause of perdition but to you of salvation and this from God

129 For unto you it is given for Christ not only to believe in him
but also to suffer for him

130 Having the same conflict as that which you have seen in me and
now have heard of me



Philippians Chapter 2


He recommends them to unity and humility and to work out their
salvation with fear and trembling

21 If there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of
charity if any society of the spirit if any bowels of commiseration

22 Fulfil ye my joy that you be of one mind having the same
charity being of one accord agreeing in sentiment

23 Let nothing be done through contention neither by vain glory But
in humility let each esteem others better than themselves

24 Each one not considering the things that are his own but those
that are other mens

25 For let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus

26 Who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal
with God

27 But emptied himself taking the form of a servant being made in
the likeness of men and in habit found as a man

Emptied himself exinanivit  made himself as of no account

28 He humbled himself becoming obedient unto death even to the
death of the cross

29 For which cause God also hath exalted him and hath given him a
name which is above all names

210 That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow of those that
are in heaven on earth and under the earth

211 And that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ
is in the glory of God the Father

212 Wherefore my dearly beloved as you have always obeyed not as
in my presence only but much more now in my absence with fear and
trembling work out your salvation

With fear etc  This is against the false faith and presumptuous
security of modern sectaries

213 For it is God who worketh in you both to will and to accomplish
according to his good will

214 And do ye all things without murmurings and hesitations

215 That you may be blameless and sincere children of God without
reproof in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation among whom
you shine as lights in the world

216 Holding forth the word of life to my glory in the day of Christ
because I have not run in vain nor laboured in vain

217 Yea and if I be made a victim upon the sacrifice and service of
your faith I rejoice and congratulate with you all

218 And for the selfsame thing do you also rejoice and congratulate
with me

219 And I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy unto you shortly
that I also may be of good comfort when I know the things concerning
you

220 For I have no man so of the same mind who with sincere affection
is solicitous for you

221 For all seek the things that are their own not the things that
are Jesus Christs

222 Now know ye the proof of him that as a son with the father so
hath he served with me in the gospel

223 Him therefore I hope to send unto you immediately so soon as I
shall see how it will go with me

224 And I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come to you
shortly

225 But I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my
brother and fellow labourer and fellow soldier but your apostle and
he that hath ministered to my wants

226 For indeed he longed after you all and was sad for that you had
heard that he was sick

227 For indeed he was sick nigh unto death but God had mercy on
him And not only on him but on me also lest I should have sorrow
upon sorrow

228 Therefore I sent him the more speedily that seeing him again
you may rejoice and I may be without sorrow

229 Receive him therefore with all joy in the Lord and treat with
honour such as he is

230 Because for the work of Christ he came to the point of death
delivering his life that he might fulfil that which on your part was
wanting towards my service



Philippians Chapter 3


He warneth them against false teachers He counts all other things
loss that he may gain Christ

31 As to the rest my brethren rejoice in the Lord To write the
same things to you to me indeed is not wearisome but to you is
necessary

32 Beware of dogs beware of evil workers beware of the concision

33 For we are the circumcision who in spirit serve God and glory in
Christ Jesus not having confidence in the flesh

34 Though I might also have confidence in the flesh If any other
thinketh he may have confidence in the flesh I more

35 Being circumcised the eighth day of the stock of Israel of the
tribe of Benjamin an Hebrew of the Hebrews According to the law a
Pharisee

36 According to zeal persecuting the church of God According to the
justice that is in the law conversing without blame

37 But the things that were gain to me the same I have counted loss
for Christ

38 Furthermore I count all things to be but loss for the excellent
knowledge of Jesus Christ my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss
of all things and count them but as dung that I may gain Christ

39 And may be found in him not having my justice which is of the
law but that which is of the faith of Christ Jesus which is of God
justice in faith

310 That I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the
fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable to his death

311 If by any means I may attain to the resurrection which is from
the dead

312 Not as though I had already attained or were already perfect
but I follow after if I may by any means apprehend wherein I am also
apprehended by Christ Jesus

313 Brethren I do not count myself to have apprehended But one
thing I do Forgetting the things that are behind and stretching forth
myself to those that are before

314 I press towards the mark to the prize of the supernal vocation
of God in Christ Jesus

315 Let us therefore as many as are perfect be thus minded and if
in any thing you be otherwise minded this also God will reveal to you

316 Nevertheless whereunto we are come that we be of the same mind
let us also continue in the same rule

317 Be ye followers of me brethren and observe them who walk so as
you have our model

318 For many walk of whom I have told you often and now tell you
weeping that they are enemies of the cross of Christ

319 Whose end is destruction whose God is their belly and whose
glory is in their shame who mind earthly things

320 But our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for
the Saviour our Lord Jesus Christ

321 Who will reform the body of our lowness made like to the body of
his glory according to the operation whereby also he is able to subdue
all things unto himself



Philippians Chapter 4


He exhorts them to perseverance in all good and acknowledges their
charitable contributions to him

41 Therefore my dearly beloved brethren and most desired my joy and
my crown so stand fast in the Lord my dearly beloved

42 I beg of Evodia and I beseech Syntyche to be of one mind in the
Lord

43 And I entreat thee also my sincere companion help those women
who have laboured with me in the gospel with Clement and the rest of
my fellow labourers whose names are in the book of life

44 Rejoice in the Lord always again I say rejoice

45 Let your modesty be known to all men The Lord is nigh

46 Be nothing solicitous but in every thing by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to
God

47 And the peace of God which surpasseth all understanding keep
your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus

48 For the rest brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever
modest whatsoever just whatsoever holy whatsoever lovely whatsoever
of good fame if there be any virtue if any praise of discipline
think on these things

For the rest brethren whatsoever things are true etc  Here the
apostle enumerates general precepts of morality which they ought to
practise Whatsoever things are true  in words in promises in
lawful oaths etc he commands rectitude of mind and sincerity of
heart Whatsoever modest  by these words he prescribes gravity in
manners modesty in dress and decency in conversation Whatsoever
just  That is in dealing with others in buying or selling in trade
or business to be fair and honest Whatsoever holy  by these words
may be understood that those who are in a religious state professed
or in holy orders should lead a life of sanctity and chastity
according to the vows they make but these words being also applied to
those in the world indicate the virtuous life they are bound by the
divine commandments to follow Whatsoever lovely  that is to
practise those good offices in society that procure us the esteem and
good will of our neighbours Whatsoever of good fame  That is that
by our conduct and behaviour we should edify our neighbours and give
them good example by our actions If there be any virtue if any praise
of discipline  that those in error by seeing the morality and good
discipline of the true religion may be converted And finally the
apostle commands not only the Philippians but all Christians to
think on these things  that is to make it their study and concern
that the peace of God might be with them

49 The things which you have both learned and received and heard and
seen in me these do ye and the God of peace shall be with you

410 Now I rejoice in the Lord exceedingly that now at length your
thought for me hath flourished again as you did also think but you
were busied

411 I speak not as it were for want For I have learned in
whatsoever state I am to be content therewith

412 I know both how to be brought low and I know how to abound
every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to
be hungry both to abound and to suffer need

413 I can do all things in him who strengtheneth me

414 Nevertheless you have done well in communicating to my
tribulation

415 And you also know O Philippians that in the beginning of the
gospel when I departed from Macedonia no church communicated with me
as concerning giving and receiving but you only

416 For unto Thessalonica also you sent once and again for my use

417 Not that I seek the gift but I seek the fruit that may abound to
your account

418 But I have all and abound I am filled having received from
Epaphroditus the things you sent an odour of sweetness an acceptable
sacrifice pleasing to God

419 And may my God supply all your want according to his riches in
glory in Christ Jesus

420 Now to God and our Father be glory world without end Amen

421 Salute ye every saint in Christ Jesus

422 The brethren who are with me salute you All the saints salute
you especially they that are of Caesars household

423 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit Amen




THE EPISTLE OF ST PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS



Colossa was a city of Phrygia near Laodicea It does not appear that
St Paul had preached there himself but that the Colossians were
converted by Epaphras a disciple of the Apostles However as St Paul
was the great Apostle of the Gentiles he wrote this Epistle to the
Colossians when he was in prison and about the same time that he wrote
to the Ephesians and Philippians The exhortations and doctrine it
contains are similar to that which is set forth in his Epistle to the
Ephesians



Colossians Chapter 1


He gives thanks for the grace bestowed upon the Colossians and prays
for them Christ is the head of the church and the peacemaker through
his blood Paul is his minister

11 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God and Timothy
a brother

12 To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ Jesus who are at
Colossa

13 Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord
Jesus Christ We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ praying always for you

14 Hearing your faith in Christ Jesus and the love which you have
towards all the saints

15 For the hope that is laid up for you in heaven which you have
heard in the word of the truth of the gospel

16 Which is come unto you as also it is in the whole world and
bringeth forth fruit and groweth even as it doth in you since the day
you heard and knew the grace of God in truth

17 As you learned of Epaphras our most beloved fellow servant who
is for you a faithful minister of Christ Jesus

18 Who also hath manifested your love in the spirit

19 Therefore we also from the day that we heard it cease not to
pray for you and to beg that you may be filled with the knowledge of
his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding

110 That you may walk worthy of God in all things pleasing being
fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God

111 Strengthened with all might according to the power of his glory
in all patience and longsuffering with joy

112 Giving thanks to God the Father who hath made us worthy to be
partakers of the lot of the saints in light

113 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath
translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love

114 In whom we have redemption through his blood the remission of
sins

115 Who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every
creature

The firstborn  That is first begotten as the Evangelist declares
the only begotten of his Father hence St Chrisostom explains
firstborn not first created as he was not created at all but born of
his Father before all ages that is coeval with the Father and with
the Holy Ghost

116 For in him were all things created in heaven and on earth
visible and invisible whether thrones or dominations or
principalities or powers All things were created by him and in him

117 And he is before all and by him all things consist

118 And he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning
the firstborn from the dead that in all things he may hold the
primacy

119 Because in him it hath well pleased the Father that all fulness
should dwell

120 And through him to reconcile all things unto himself making
peace through the blood of his cross both as to the things that are on
earth and the things that are in heaven

121 And you whereas you were some time alienated and enemies in mind
in evil works

122 Yet now he hath reconciled in the body of his flesh through
death to present you holy and unspotted and blameless before him

123 If so ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and
immoveable from the hope of the gospel which you have heard which is
preached in all the creation that is under heaven whereof I Paul am
made a minister

124 Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up those things
that are wanting of the sufferings of Christ in my flesh for his
body which is the church

Wanting  There is no want in the sufferings of Christ in himself as
head but many sufferings are still wanting or are still to come in
his body the church and his members the faithful

125 Whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of
God which is given me towards you that I may fulfil the word of God

126 The mystery which hath been hidden from ages and generations but
now is manifested to his saints

127 To whom God would make known the riches of the glory of this
mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory

128 Whom we preach admonishing every man and teaching every man in
all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus

129 Wherein also I labour striving according to his working which he
worketh in me in power



Colossians Chapter 2


He warns them against the impostures of the philosophers and the Jewish
teachers that would withdraw them from Christ

21 For I would have you know what manner of care I have for you and
for them that are at Laodicea and whosoever have not seen my face in
the flesh

22 That their hearts may be comforted being instructed in charity
and unto all riches of fulness of understanding unto the knowledge of
the mystery of God the Father and of Christ Jesus

23 In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge

24 Now this I say that no man may deceive you by loftiness of words

25 For though I be absent in body yet in spirit I am with you
rejoicing and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith
which is in Christ

26 As therefore you have received Jesus Christ the Lord walk ye in
him

27 Rooted and built up in him and confirmed in the faith as also you
have learned abounding in him in thanksgiving

28 Beware lest any man cheat you by philosophy and vain deceit
according to the tradition of men according to the elements of the
world and not according to Christ

29 For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead corporeally

210 And you are filled in him who is the head of all principality
and power

211 In whom also you are circumcised with circumcision not made by
hand in despoiling of the body of the flesh but in the circumcision of
Christ

212 Buried with him in baptism in whom also you are risen again by
the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him up from the dead

213 And you when you were dead in your sins and the uncircumcision
of your flesh he hath quickened together with him forgiving you all
offences

214 Blotting out the handwriting of the decree that was against us
which was contrary to us And he hath taken the same out of the way
fastening it to the cross

215 And despoiling the principalities and powers he hath exposed
them confidently in open shew triumphing over them in himself

216 Let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect
of a festival day or of the new moon or of the sabbaths

In meat etc  He means with regard to the Jewish observations of the
distinction of clean and unclean meats and of their festivals new
moons and sabbaths as being no longer obligatory

217 Which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of Christ

218 Let no man seduce you willing in humility and religion of
angels walking in the things which he hath not seen in vain puffed up
by the sense of his flesh

Willing etc  That is by a self willed self invented superstitious
worship falsely pretending humility but really proceeding from pride
Such was the worship that many of the philosophers against whom St
Paul speaks ver 8 paid to angels or demons by sacrificing to them
as carriers of intelligence betwixt God and men pretending humility in
so doing as if God was too great to be addressed by men and setting
aside the mediatorship of Jesus Christ who is the head both of angels
and men Such also was the worship paid by the ancient heretics
disciples of Simon and Menander to the angels whom they believed to
be makers and lords of this lower world This is certain that they
whom the apostle here condemns did not hold the head ver 19 that
is Jesus Christ and his mediatorship and therefore what he writes
here no way touches the Catholic doctrine and practice of desiring our
good angels to pray to God for us through Jesus Christ St Jerome
Epist ad Algas understands by the religion or service of angels
the Jewish teachers who sought to subject the new Christians to the
observance of the Mosaic law

219 And not holding the head from which the whole body by joints
and bands being supplied with nourishment and compacted groweth into
the increase of God

220 If then you be dead with Christ from the elements of this world
why do you yet decree as though living in the world

221 Touch not taste not handle not

Touch not etc  The meaning is that Christians should not subject
themselves either to the ordinances of the old law forbidding
touching or tasting things unclean or to the superstitious invention
of heretics imposing such restraints under pretence of wisdom
humility or mortification

222 Which all are unto destruction by the very use according to the
precepts and doctrines of men

223 Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in superstition and
humility and not sparing the body not in any honour to the filling of
the flesh



Colossians Chapter 3


He exhorts them to put off the old man and to put on the new The
duties of wives and husbands children and servants

31 Therefore if you be risen with Christ seek the things that are
above where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God

32 Mind the things that are above not the things that are upon the
earth

33 For you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God

34 When Christ shall appear who is your life then you also shall
appear with him in glory

35 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth
fornication uncleanness lust evil concupiscence and covetousness
which is the service of idols

36 For which things the wrath of God cometh upon the children of
unbelief

37 In which you also walked some time when you lived in them

38 But now put you also all away anger indignation malice
blasphemy filthy speech out of your mouth

39 Lie not one to another stripping yourselves of the old man with
his deeds

310 And putting on the new him who is renewed unto knowledge
according to the image of him that created him

311 Where there is neither Gentile nor Jew circumcision nor
uncircumcision Barbarian nor Scythian bond nor free But Christ is
all and in all

312 Put ye on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved the
bowels of mercy benignity humility modesty patience

313 Bearing with one another and forgiving one another if any have a
complaint against another Even as the Lord hath forgiven you so do
you also

314 But above all these things have charity which is the bond of
perfection

315 And let the peace of Christ rejoice in your hearts wherein also
you are called in one body and be ye thankful

316 Let the word of Christ dwell in you abundantly in all wisdom
teaching and admonishing one another in psalms hymns and spiritual
canticles singing in grace in your hearts to God

317 All whatsoever you do in word or in work do all in the name of
the Lord Jesus Christ giving thanks to God and the Father by him

318 Wives be subject to your husbands as it behoveth in the Lord

319 Husbands love your wives and be not bitter towards them

320 Children obey your parents in all things for this is well
pleasing to the Lord

321 Fathers provoke not your children to indignation lest they be
discouraged

322 Servants obey in all things your masters according to the flesh
not serving to the eye as pleasing men but in simplicity of heart
fearing God

323 Whatsoever you do do it from the heart as to the Lord and not
to men

324 Knowing that you shall receive of the Lord the reward of
inheritance Serve ye the Lord Christ

325 For he that doth wrong shall receive for that which he hath done
wrongfully And there is no respect of persons with God



Colossians Chapter 4


He recommends constant prayer and wisdom Various salutations

41 Masters do to your servants that which is just and equal knowing
that you also have a master in heaven

42 Be instant in prayer watching in it with thanksgiving

43 Praying withal for us also that God may open unto us a door of
speech to speak the mystery of Christ for which also I am bound

44 That I may make it manifest as I ought to speak

45 Walk with wisdom towards them that are without redeeming the
time

46 Let your speech be always in grace seasoned with salt that you
may know how you ought to answer every man

47 All the things that concern me Tychicus our dearest brother and
faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord will make known to
you

48 What I have sent to you for this same purpose that he may know
the things that concern you and comfort your hearts

49 With Onesimus a most beloved and faithful brother who is one of
you All things that are done here they shall make known to you

410 Aristarchus my fellow prisoner saluteth you and Mark the
cousin german of Barnabas touching whom you have received
commandments If he come unto you receive him

411 And Jesus that is called Justus who are of the circumcision
These only are my helpers in the kingdom of God who have been a
comfort to me

412 Epaphras saluteth you who is one of you a servant of Christ
Jesus who is always solicitous for you in prayers that you may stand
perfect and full in all the will of God

413 For I bear him testimony that he hath much labour for you and for
them that are at Laodicea and them at Hierapolis

414 Luke the most dear physician saluteth you and Demas

415 Salute the brethren who are at Laodicea and Nymphas and the
church that is in his house

416 And when this epistle shall have been read with you cause that
it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans and that you read that
which is of the Laodiceans

And that you read that which is of the Laodiceans  What this epistle
was is uncertain and annotators have given different opinions
concerning it Some expound these words of an epistle which St Paul
wrote to the Laodiceans and is since lost for that now extant is no
more than a collection of sentences out of the other epistles of St
Paul therefore it cannot be considered even as a part of that epistle
Others explain that the text means a letter sent to St Paul by the
Laodiceans which he sends to the Colossians to be read by them
However this opinion does not seem well founded Hence it is more
probable that St Paul wrote an epistle from Rome to the Laodiceans
about the same time that he wrote to the Colossians as he had them
both equally at heart and that he ordered that epistle to be read by
the Colossians for their instructions and being neighbouring cities
they might communicate to each other what they had received from him
as one epistle might contain some matters not related in the other and
would be equally useful for their concern and more particularly as
they were equally disturbed by intruders and false teachers against
which the apostle was anxious to warn them lest they should be
infected by their pernicious doctrine

417 And say to Archippus Take heed to the ministry which thou hast
received in the Lord that thou fulfil it

418 The salutation of Paul with my own hand Be mindful of my bands
Grace be with you Amen




THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS



Thessalonica was the capital of Macedonia in which St Paul having
preached the Gospel converted some Jews and a great number of the
Gentiles but the unbelieving Jews envying his success raised such a
commotion against him that he and his companion Sylvanus were obliged
to quit the city Afterwards he went to Athens where he heard that the
converts in Thessalonica were under a severe persecution ever since
his departure and lest they should lose their fortitude he sent
Timothy to strengthen and comfort them in their sufferings In the
meantime St Paul came to Corinth where he wrote this first Epistle
and also the second to the Thessalonians both in the same year being
the nineteenth after our Lords Ascension These are the first of his
Epistles in the order of time



1 Thessalonians Chapter 1


He gives thanks for the grace bestowed on the Thessalonians

11 Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians
in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ

12 Grace be to you and peace We give thanks to God always for you
all making a remembrance of you in our prayers without ceasing

13 Being mindful of the work of your faith and labour and charity
and of the enduring of the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ before God and
our Father

14 Knowing brethren beloved of God your election

15 For our gospel hath not been unto you in word only but in power
also and in the Holy Ghost and in much fulness as you know what
manner of men we have been among you for your sakes

16 And you became followers of us and of the Lord receiving the word
in much tribulation with joy of the Holy Ghost

17 So that you were made a pattern to all that believe in Macedonia
and in Achaia

18 For from you was spread abroad the word of the Lord not only in
Macedonia and in Achaia but also in every place your faith which is
towards God is gone forth so that we need not to speak any thing

19 For they themselves relate of us what manner of entering in we
had unto you and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living
and true God

110 And to wait for his Son from heaven whom he raised up from the
dead Jesus who hath delivered us from the wrath to come



1 Thessalonians Chapter 2


The sincerity of the apostles preaching the gospel to them and of
their receiving it

21 For yourselves know brethren our entrance in unto you that it
was not in vain

22 But having suffered many things before and been shamefully
treated as you know at Philippi we had confidence in our God to
speak unto you the gospel of God in much carefulness

23 For our exhortation was not of error nor of uncleanness nor in
deceit

24 But as we were approved by God that the gospel should be committed
to us even so we speak not as pleasing men but God who proveth our
hearts

25 For neither have we used at any time the speech of flattery as
you know nor taken an occasion of covetousness God is witness

26 Nor sought we glory of men neither of you nor of others

27 Whereas we might have been burdensome to you as the apostles of
Christ but we became little ones in the midst of you as if a nurse
should cherish her children

28 So desirous of you we would gladly impart unto you not only the
gospel of God but also our own souls because you were become most dear
unto us

29 For you remember brethren our labour and toil working night and
day lest we should be chargeable to any of you we preached among you
the gospel of God

210 You are witnesses and God also how holily and justly and
without blame we have been to you that have believed

211 As you know in what manner entreating and comforting you as a
father doth his children

212 We testified to every one of you that you would walk worthy of
God who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory

214 For you brethren are become followers of the churches of God
which are in Judea in Christ Jesus for you also have suffered the
same things from your own countrymen even as they have from the Jews

215 Who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and have
persecuted us and please not God and are adversaries to all men

216 Prohibiting us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved
to fill up their sins always for the wrath of God is come upon them to
the end

To fill up their sins  That is to fill up the measure of their sins
after which Gods justice would punish them For the wrath of God is
come upon them to the end  That is to continue on them to the end

217 But we brethren being taken away from you for a short time in
sight not in heart have hastened the more abundantly to see your face
with great desire

218 For we would have come unto you I Paul indeed once and again
but Satan hath hindered us

219 For what is our hope or joy or crown of glory Are not you in
the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming

220 For you are our glory and joy



1 Thessalonians Chapter 3


The apostles concern and love for the Thessalonians

31 For which cause forbearing no longer we thought it good to
remain at Athens alone

32 And we sent Timothy our brother and the minister of God in the
gospel of Christ to confirm you and exhort you concerning your faith

33 That no man should be moved in these tribulations for yourselves
know that we are appointed thereunto

34 For even when we were with you we foretold you that we should
suffer tribulations as also it is come to pass and you know

35 For this cause also I forbearing no longer sent to know your
faith lest perhaps he that tempteth should have tempted you and our
labour should be made vain

36 But now when Timothy came to us from you and related to us your
faith and charity and that you have a good remembrance of us always
desiring to see us as we also to see you

37 Therefore we were comforted brethren in you in all our
necessity and tribulation by your faith

38 Because now we live if you stand in the Lord

39 For what thanks can we return to God for you in all the joy
wherewith we rejoice for you before our God

310 Night and day more abundantly praying that we may see your face
and may accomplish those things that are wanting to your faith

311 Now God himself and our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ direct
our way unto you

312 And may the Lord multiply you and make you abound in charity
towards one another and towards all men as we do also towards you

313 To confirm your hearts without blame in holiness before God and
our Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his
saints Amen



1 Thessalonians Chapter 4


He exhorts them to purity and mutual charity He treats of the
resurrection of the dead

41 For the rest therefore brethren pray and beseech you in the Lord
Jesus that as you have received from us how you ought to walk and to
please God so also you would walk that you may abound the more

42 For you know what precepts I have given to you by the Lord Jesus

43 For this is the will of God your sanctification That you should
abstain from fornication

44 That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in
sanctification and honour

45 Not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles that know not God

46 And that no man overreach nor circumvent his brother in business
because the Lord is the avenger of all these things as we have told
you before and have testified

47 For God hath not called us unto uncleanness but unto
sanctification

48 Therefore he that despiseth these things despiseth not man but
God who also hath given his holy Spirit in us

49 But as touching the charity of brotherhood we have no need to
write to you for yourselves have learned of God to love one another

410 For indeed you do it towards all the brethren in all Macedonia
But we entreat you brethren that you abound more

411 And that you use your endeavour to be quiet and that you do your
own business and work with your own hands as we commanded you and
that you walk honestly towards them that are without and that you want
nothing of any mans

412 And we will not have you ignorant brethren concerning them that
are asleep that you be not sorrowful even as others who have no hope

413 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them
who have slept through Jesus will God bring with him

414 For this we say unto you in the word of the Lord that we who are
alive who remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them
who have slept

415 For the Lord himself shall come down from heaven with commandment
and with the voice of an archangel and with the trumpet of God and the
dead who are in Christ shall rise first

416 Then we who are alive who are left shall be taken up together
with them in the clouds to meet Christ into the air and so shall we
be always with the Lord

417 Wherefore comfort ye one another with these words



1 Thessalonians Chapter 5


The day of the Lord shall come when least expected Exhortations to
several duties

51 But of the times and moments brethren you need not that we
should write to you

52 For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord shall so
come as a thief in the night

53 For when they shall say Peace and security then shall sudden
destruction come upon them as the pains upon her that is with child
and they shall not escape

54 But you brethren are not in darkness that the day should
overtake you as a thief

55 For all you are the children of light and children of the day we
are not of the night nor of darkness

56 Therefore let us not sleep as others do but let us watch and
be sober

57 For they that sleep sleep in the night and they that are drunk
are drunk in the night

58 But let us who are of the day be sober having on the breast
plate of faith and charity and for a helmet the hope of salvation

59 For God hath not appointed us unto wrath but unto the purchasing
of salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ

510 Who died for us that whether we watch or sleep we may live
together with him

511 For which cause comfort one another and edify one another as you
also do

512 And we beseech you brethren to know them who labour among you
and are over you in the Lord and admonish you

513 That you esteem them more abundantly in charity for their works
sake Have peace with them

514 And we beseech you brethren rebuke the unquiet comfort the
feeble minded support the weak be patient towards all men

The unquiet  That is such as are irregular and disorderly

515 See that none render evil for evil to any man but ever follow
that which is good towards each other and towards all men

516 Always rejoice

517 Pray without ceasing

518 In all things give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ
Jesus concerning you all

519 Extinguish not the spirit

520 Despise not prophecies

521 But prove all things hold fast that which is good

522 From all appearance of evil refrain yourselves

523 And may the God of peace himself sanctify you in all things that
your whole spirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless in the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ

524 He is faithful who hath called you who also will do it

525 Brethren pray for us

526 Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss

527 I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read to all the
holy brethren

528 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you Amen




THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS



In this Epistle St Paul admonishes the Thessalonians to be constant in
the faith of Christ and not to be terrified by the insinuations of
false teachers telling them that the day of judgment was near at hand
as there must come many signs and wonders before it He bids them to
hold firm the traditions received from him whether by word or by
epistle and shews them how they may be certain of his letters by the
manner he writes



2 Thessalonians Chapter 1


He gives thanks to God for their faith and constancy and prays for
their advancement in all good

11 Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians
In God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ

12 Grace unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord
Jesus Christ

13 We are bound to give thanks always to God for you brethren as it
is fitting because your faith groweth exceedingly and the charity of
every one of you towards each other aboundeth

14 So that we ourselves also glory in you in the churches of God for
your patience and faith and in all your persecutions and tribulations
which you endure

15 For an example of the just judgment of God that you may be
counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which also you suffer

16 Seeing it is a just thing with God to repay tribulation to them
that trouble you

17 And to you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus
shall be revealed from heaven with the angels of his power

18 In a flame of fire giving vengeance to them who know not God and
who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ

19 Who shall suffer eternal punishment in destruction from the face
of the Lord and from the glory of his power

110 When he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be made
wonderful in all them who have believed because our testimony was
believed upon you in that day

111 Wherefore also we pray always for you That our God would make
you worthy of his vocation and fulfil all the good pleasure of his
goodness and the work of faith in power

112 That the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you and you
in him according to the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ



2 Thessalonians Chapter 2


The day of the Lord is not to come till the man of sin be revealed The
apostles traditions are to be observed

21 And we beseech you brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ and of our gathering together unto him

22 That you be not easily moved from your sense nor be terrified
neither by spirit nor by word nor by epistle as sent from us as if
the day of the Lord were at hand

23 Let no man deceive you by any means for unless there come a
revolt first and the man of sin be revealed the son of perdition

A revolt  This revolt or falling off is generally understood by
the ancient fathers of a revolt from the Roman empire which was first
to be destroyed before the coming of Antichrist It may perhaps be
understood also of a revolt of many nations from the Catholic Church
which has in part happened already by means of Mahomet Luther c
and it may be supposed will be more general in the days of the
Antichrist The man of sin  Here must be meant some particular man
as is evident from the frequent repetition of the Greek article o
the man of sin the son of perdition the adversary or opposer
It agrees to the wicked and great Antichrist who will come before the
end of the world

24 Who opposeth and is lifted up above all that is called God or that
is worshipped so that he sitteth in the temple of God shewing himself
as if he were God

In the temple  Either that of Jerusalem which some think he will
rebuild or in some Christian church which he will pervert to his own
worship as Mahomet has done by the churches of the east

25 Remember you not that when I was yet with you I told you these
things

26 And now you know what withholdeth that he may be revealed in his
time

27 For the mystery of iniquity already worketh only that he who now
holdeth do hold until he be taken out of the way

28 And then that wicked one shall be revealed whom the Lord Jesus
shall kill with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the
brightness of his coming him

29 Whose coming is according to the working of Satan in all power
and signs and lying wonders

210 And in all seduction of iniquity to them that perish because
they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved
Therefore God shall send them the operation of error to believe lying

God shall send  That is God shall suffer them to be deceived by lying
wonders and false miracles in punishment of their not entertaining
the love of truth

211 That all may be judged who have not believed the truth but have
consented to iniquity

212 But we ought to give thanks to God always for you brethren
beloved of God for that God hath chosen you firstfruits unto
salvation in sanctification of the spirit and faith of the truth

213 Whereunto also he hath called you by our gospel unto the
purchasing of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ

214 Therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which
you have learned whether by word or by our epistle

Traditions  See here that the unwritten traditions are no less to be
received than their epistles

215 Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God and our Father who
hath loved us and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope
in grace

216 Exhort your hearts and confirm you in every good work and word



2 Thessalonians Chapter 3


He begs their prayers and warns them against idleness

31 For the rest brethren pray for us that the word of God may run
and may be glorified even as among you

May run  That is may spread itself and have free course

32 And that we may be delivered from importunate and evil men for
all men have not faith

33 But God is faithful who will strengthen and keep you from evil

34 And we have confidence concerning you in the Lord that the things
which we command you both do and will do

35 And the Lord direct your hearts in the charity of God and the
patience of Christ

36 And we charge you brethren in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
that you withdraw yourselves from every brother walking disorderly and
not according to the tradition which they have received of us

37 For yourselves know how you ought to imitate us For we were not
disorderly among you

38 Neither did we eat any mans bread for nothing but in labour and
in toil we worked night and day lest we should be chargeable to any of
you

39 Not as if we had not power but that we might give ourselves a
pattern unto you to imitate us

310 For also when we were with you this we declared to you that
if any man will not work neither let him eat

311 For we have heard there are some among you who walk disorderly
working not at all but curiously meddling

312 Now we charge them that are such and beseech them by the Lord
Jesus Christ that working with silence they would eat their own
bread

313 But you brethren be not weary in well doing

314 And if any man obey not our word by this epistle note that man
and do not keep company with him that he may be ashamed

315 Yet do not esteem him as an enemy but admonish him as a brother

316 Now the Lord of peace himself give you everlasting peace in every
place The Lord be with you all

317 The salutation of Paul with my own hand which is the sign in
every epistle So I write

318 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all Amen




THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST PAUL TO TIMOTHY



St Paul write this Epistle to his BELOVED TIMOTHY being then bishop
of Ephesus to instruct him in the duties of a bishop both in respect
to himself and to his charge and that he ought to be well informed of
the good morals of those on whom he was to impose hands Impose not
hands lightly upon any man He tells him also how he should behave
towards his clergy The Epistle was written about 33 years after our
Lords Ascension but where it was written is uncertain the more
general opinion is that it was in Macedonia



1 Timothy Chapter 1


He puts Timothy in mind of his charge and blesses God for the mercy he
himself had received

11 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the commandment of
God our Saviour and Christ Jesus our hope

12 To Timothy his beloved son in faith Grace mercy and peace from
God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord

13 As I desired thee to remain at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia
that thou mightest charge some not to teach otherwise

14 Not to give heed to fables and endless genealogies which furnish
questions rather than the edification of God which is in faith

15 Now the end of the commandment is charity from a pure heart and a
good conscience and an unfeigned faith

16 From which things some going astray are turned aside unto vain
babbling

17 Desiring to be teachers of the law understanding neither the
things they say nor whereof they affirm

18 But we know that the law is good if a man use it lawfully

19 Knowing this That the law is not made for the just man but for
the unjust and disobedient for the ungodly and for sinners for the
wicked and defiled for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers
for manslayers

The law is not  He means that the just man doth good and avoideth
evil not as compelled by the law and merely for fear of the
punishment appointed for transgressors but voluntarily and out of the
love of God and virtue and would do so though there were no law

110 For fornicators for them who defile themselves with mankind for
menstealers for liars for perjured persons and whatever other thing
is contrary to sound doctrine

111 Which is according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God
which hath been committed to my trust

112 I give him thanks who hath strengthened me even to Christ Jesus
our Lord for that he hath counted me faithful putting me in the
ministry

113 Who before was a blasphemer and a persecutor and contumelious
But I obtained the mercy of God because I did it ignorantly in
unbelief

114 Now the grace of our Lord hath abounded exceedingly with faith
and love which is in Christ Jesus

115 A faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ
Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am the chief

116 But for this cause have I obtained mercy that in me first Christ
Jesus might shew forth all patience for the information of them that
shall believe in him unto life everlasting

117 Now to the king of ages immortal invisible the only God be
honour and glory for ever and ever Amen

118 This precept I commend to thee O son Timothy according to the
prophecies going before on thee that thou war in them a good warfare

119 Having faith and a good conscience which some rejecting have
made shipwreck concerning the faith

120 Of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander whom I have delivered up to
Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme



1 Timothy Chapter 2


Prayers are to be said for all men because God wills the salvation of
all Women are not to teach

21 I desire therefore first of all that supplications prayers
intercessions and thanksgivings be made for all men

22 For kings and for all that are in high station that we may lead a
quiet and a peaceable life in all piety and chastity

23 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour

24 Who will have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of
the truth

25 For there is one God and one mediator of God and men the man
Christ Jesus

One mediator  Christ is the one and only mediator of redemption who
gave himself as the apostle writes in the following verse

26 Who gave himself a redemption for all a testimony in due times

a redemption for all   He is also the only mediator who stands in
need of no other to recommend his petitions to the Father But this is
not against our seeking the prayers and intercession as well of the
faithful upon earth as of the saints and angels in heaven for
obtaining mercy grace and salvation through Jesus Christ As St
Paul himself often desired the help of the prayers of the faithful
without any injury to the mediatorship of Jesus Christ

27 Whereunto I am appointed a preacher and an apostle I say the
truth I lie not a doctor of the Gentiles in faith and truth

28 I will therefore that men pray in every place lifting up pure
hands without anger and contention

29 In like manner women also in decent apparel adorning themselves
with modesty and sobriety not with plaited hair or gold or pearls
or costly attire

210 But as it becometh women professing godliness with good works

211 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection

212 But I suffer not a woman to teach nor to use authority over the
man but to be in silence

213For Adam was first formed then Eve

214 And Adam was not seduced but the woman being seduced was in
the transgression

215 Yet she shall be saved through child bearing if she continue in
faith and love and sanctification with sobriety



1 Timothy Chapter 3


What sort of men are to be admitted into the clergy The church is the
pillar of truth

31 A faithful saying If a man desire the office of a bishop he
desireth good work

32 It behoveth therefore a bishop to be blameless the husband of one
wife sober prudent of good behaviour chaste given to hospitality
a teacher

Of one wife   The meaning is not that every bishop should have a wife
for St Paul himself had none but that no one should be admitted to
the holy orders of bishop priest or deacon who had been married more
than once

33 Not given to wine no striker but modest not quarrelsome not
covetous but

34 One that ruleth well his own house having his children in
subjection with all chastity

35 But if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take
care of the church of God

36 Not a neophyte lest being puffed up with pride he fall into the
judgment of the devil

A neophyte   That is one lately baptized a young convert

37 Moreover he must have a good testimony of them who are without
lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil

38 Deacons in like manner chaste not double tongued not given to
much wine not greedy of filthy lucre

39 Holding the mystery of faith in a pure conscience

310 And let these also first be proved and so let them minister
having no crime

311 The women in like manner chaste not slanderers but sober
faithful in all things

312 Let deacons be the husbands of one wife who rule well their
children and their own houses

313 For they that have ministered well shall purchase to themselves a
good degree and much confidence in the faith which is in Christ Jesus

314 These things I write to thee hoping that I shall come to thee
shortly

315 But if I tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to
behave thyself in the house of God which is the church of the living
God the pillar and ground of the truth

The pillar and ground of the truth   Therefore the church of the
living God can never uphold error nor bring in corruptions
superstition or idolatry

316 And evidently great is the mystery of godliness which was
manifested in the flesh was justified in the spirit appeared unto
angels hath been preached unto the Gentiles is believed in the world
is taken up in glory



1 Timothy Chapter 4


He warns him against heretics and exhorts him to the exercise of
piety

41 Now the Spirit manifestly saith that in the last times some shall
depart from the faith giving heed to spirits of error and doctrines of
devils

42 Speaking lies in hypocrisy and having their conscience seared

43 Forbidding to marry to abstain from meats which God hath created
to be received with thanksgiving by the faithful and by them that have
known the truth

Forbidding to marry to abstain from meats   He speaks of the
Gnostics the Marcionites the Eneratites the Manicheans and other
ancient heretics who absolutely condemned marriage and the use of all
kind of meat because they pretended that all flesh was from an evil
principle Whereas the church of God so far from condemning marriage
holds it a holy sacrament and forbids it to none but such as by vow
have chosen the better part and prohibits not the use of any meats
whatsoever in proper times and seasons though she does not judge all
kind of diet proper for days of fasting and penance

44 For every creature of God is good and nothing to be rejected that
is received with thanksgiving

45 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer

46 These things proposing to the brethren thou shalt be a good
minister of Christ Jesus nourished up in the words of faith and of the
good doctrine which thou hast attained unto

47 But avoid foolish and old wives fables and exercise thyself unto
godliness

48 For bodily exercise is profitable to little but godliness is
profitable to all things having promise of the life that now is and of
that which is to come

49 A faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation

410 For therefore we labour and are reviled because we hope in the
living God who is the Saviour of all men especially of the faithful

411 These things command and teach

412 Let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the
faithful in word in conversation in charity in faith in chastity

413 Till I come attend unto reading to exhortation and to doctrine

414 Neglect not the grace that is in thee which was given thee by
prophecy with imposition of the hands of the priesthood

415 Meditate upon these things be wholly in these things that thy
profiting may be manifest to all

416 Take heed to thyself and to doctrine be earnest in them For in
doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee



1 Timothy Chapter 5


He gives him lessons concerning widows and how he is to behave to his
clergy

51 An ancient man rebuke not but entreat him as a father young men
as brethren

52 Old women as mothers young women as sisters in all chastity

53 Honour widows that are widows indeed

54 But if any widow have children or grandchildren let her learn
first to govern her own house and to make a return of duty to her
parents for this is acceptable before God

55 But she that is a widow indeed and desolate let her trust in God
and continue in supplications and prayers night and day

56 For she that liveth in pleasures is dead while she is living

57 And this give in charge that they may be blameless

58 But if any man have not care of his own and especially of those of
his house he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel

59 Let a widow be chosen of no less than threescore years of age who
hath been the wife of one husband

510 Having testimony for her good works if she have brought up
children if she have received to harbour if she have washed the
saints feet if she have ministered to them that suffer tribulation
if she have diligently followed every good work

511 But the younger widows avoid For when they have grown wanton in
Christ they will marry

512 Having damnation because they have made void their first faith

Their first faith   Their vow by which they had engaged themselves
to Christ

513 And withal being idle they learn to go about from house to house
and are not only idle but tattlers also and busy bodies speaking
things which they ought not

514 I will therefore that the younger should marry bear children
be mistresses of families give no occasion to the adversary to speak
evil

515 For some are already turned aside after Satan

516 If any of the faithful have widows let him minister to them and
let not the church be charged that there may be sufficient for them
that are widows indeed

517 Let the priests that rule well be esteemed worthy of double
honour especially they who labour in the word and doctrine

518 For the scripture saith Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that
treadeth out the corn and The labourer is worthy of his reward

519 Against a priest receive not an accusation but under two or
three witnesses

520 Them that sin reprove before all that the rest also may have
fear

521 I charge thee before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels
that thou observe these things without prejudice doing nothing by
declining to either side

522 Impose not hands lightly upon any man neither be partaker of
other mens sins Keep thyself chaste

523 Do not still drink water but use a little wine for thy stomachs
sake and thy frequent infirmities

524 Some mens sins are manifest going before to judgment and some
men they follow after

525 In like manner also good deeds are manifest and they that are
otherwise cannot be hid



1 Timothy Chapter 6


Duties of servants The danger of covetousness Lessons for the rich

61 Whosoever are servants under the yoke let them count their
masters worthy of all honour lest the name of the Lord and his
doctrine be blasphemed

62 But they that have believing masters let them not despise them
because they are brethren but serve them the rather because they are
faithful and beloved who are partakers of the benefit These things
teach and exhort

63 If any man teach otherwise and consent not to the sound words of
our Lord Jesus Christ and to that doctrine which is according to
godliness

64 He is proud knowing nothing but sick about questions and strifes
of words from which arise envies contentions blasphemies evil
suspicions

65 Conflicts of men corrupted in mind and who are destitute of the
truth supposing gain to be godliness

66 But godliness with contentment is great gain

67 For we brought nothing into this world and certainly we can carry
nothing out

68 But having food and wherewith to be covered with these we are
content

69 For they that will become rich fall into temptation and into the
snare of the devil and into many unprofitable and hurtful desires
which drown men into destruction and perdition

610 For the desire of money is the root of all evils which some
coveting have erred from the faith and have entangled themselves in
many sorrows

611 But thou O man of God fly these things and pursue justice
godliness faith charity patience mildness

612 Fight the good fight of faith Lay hold on eternal life
whereunto thou art called and be it confessed a good confession before
many witnesses

613 I charge thee before God who quickeneth all things and before
Christ Jesus who gave testimony under Pontius Pilate a good
confession

614 That thou keep the commandment without spot blameless unto the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ

615 Which in his times he shall shew who is the Blessed and only
Mighty the King of kings and Lord of lords

616 Who only hath immortality and inhabiteth light inaccessible whom
no man hath seen nor can see to whom be honour and empire
everlasting Amen

617 Charge the rich of this world not to be highminded nor to trust
in the uncertainty of riches but in the living God who giveth us
abundantly all things to enjoy

618 To do good to be rich in good work to give easily to
communicate to others

619 To lay up in store for themselves a good foundation against the
time to come that they may lay hold on the true life

620 O Timothy keep that which is committed to thy trust avoiding
the profane novelties of words and oppositions of knowledge falsely so
called

621 Which some promising have erred concerning the faith Grace be
with thee Amen




THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST PAUL TO TIMOTHY



In this Epistle the Apostle again instructs and admonishes Timothy in
what belonged to his office as in the former and also warns him to
shun the conversation of those who had erred from the truth describing
at the same time their character He tells him of his approaching death
and desires him to come speedily to him It appears from this
circumstance that he wrote this second Epistle in the time of his last
imprisonment at Rome and not long before his martyrdom



2 Timothy Chapter 1


He admonishes him to stir up the grace he received by his ordination
and not to be discouraged at his sufferings but to hold firm the sound
doctrine of the gospel

11 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God according to
the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus

12 To Timothy my dearly beloved son Grace mercy and peace from
God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord

13 I give thanks to God whom I serve from my forefathers with a
pure conscience that without ceasing I have a remembrance of thee in
my prayers night and day

14 Desiring to see thee being mindful of thy tears that I may be
filled with joy

15 Calling to mind that faith which is in thee unfeigned which also
dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and in thy mother Eunice and I am
certain that in thee also

16 For which cause I admonish thee that thou stir up the grace of God
which is in thee by the imposition of my hands

17 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of
love and of sobriety

18 Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor of
me his prisoner but labour with the gospel according to the power of
God

19 Who hath delivered us and called us by his holy calling not
according to our own works but according to his own purpose and grace
which was given us in Christ Jesus before the times of the world

110 But is now made manifest by the illumination of our Saviour Jesus
Christ who hath destroyed death and hath brought to light life and
incorruption by the gospel

By the illumination  That is by the bright coming and appearing of
our Saviour

111 Wherein I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and teacher of
the Gentiles

112 For which cause I also suffer these things but I am not
ashamed For I know whom I have believed and I am certain that he is
able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day

113 Hold the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me in
faith and in the love which is in Christ Jesus

114 Keep the good thing committed to thy trust by the Holy Ghost who
dwelleth in us

115 Thou knowest this that all they who are in Asia are turned away
from me of whom are Phigellus and Hermogenes

116 The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus because he hath
often refreshed me and hath not been ashamed of my chain

117 But when he was come to Rome he carefully sought me and found
me

118 The Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day
And in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus thou very well
knowest



2 Timothy Chapter 2


He exhorts him to diligence in his office and patience in suffering
The danger of the delusions of heretics

21 Thou therefore my son be strong in Christ Jesus

22 And the things which thou hast heard of me by many witnesses the
same commend to faithful men who shall be fit to teach others also

23 Labour as a good soldier of Christ Jesus

24 No man being a soldier to God entangleth himself with secular
businesses that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself

25 For he also that striveth for the mastery is not crowned except
he strive lawfully

26 The husbandman that laboureth must first partake of the fruits

27 Understand what I say for the Lord will give thee in all things
understanding

28 Be mindful that the Lord Jesus Christ is risen again from the
dead of the seed of David according to my gospel

29 Wherein I labour even unto bands as an evildoer But the word of
God is not bound

210 Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect that
they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with
heavenly glory

211 A faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall live also
with him

212 If we suffer we shall also reign with him If we deny him he
will also deny us

213 If we believe not he continueth faithful he cannot deny
himself

214 Of these things put them in mind charging them before the Lord
Contend not in words for it is to no profit but to the subverting of
the hearers

215 Carefully study to present thyself approved unto God a workman
that needeth not to be ashamed rightly handling the word of truth

216 But shun profane and vain babblings for they grow much towards
ungodliness

217 And their speech spreadeth like a canker of whom are Hymeneus
and Philetus

218 Who have erred from the truth saying that the resurrection is
past already and have subverted the faith of some

219 But the sure foundation of God standeth firm having this seal
the Lord knoweth who are his and let every one depart from iniquity
who nameth the name of the Lord

220 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of
silver but also of wood and of earth and some indeed unto honour but
some unto dishonour

221 If any man therefore shall cleanse himself from these he shall
be a vessel unto honour sanctified and profitable to the Lord
prepared unto every good work

222 But flee thou youthful desires and pursue justice faith
charity and peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart

223 And avoid foolish and unlearned questions knowing that they
beget strifes

224 But the servant of the Lord must not wrangle but be mild toward
all men apt to teach patient

225 With modesty admonishing them that resist the truth if
peradventure God may give them repentance to know the truth

226 And they may recover themselves from the snares of the devil by
whom they are held captive at his will



2 Timothy Chapter 3


The character of heretics of latter days He exhorts Timothy to
constancy Of the great profit of the knowledge of the scriptures

31 Know also this that in the last days shall come dangerous times

32 Men shall be lovers of themselves covetous haughty proud
blasphemers disobedient to parents ungrateful wicked

33 Without affection without peace slanderers incontinent
unmerciful without kindness

34 Traitors stubborn puffed up and lovers of pleasure more than of
God

35 Having an appearance indeed of godliness but denying the power
thereof Now these avoid

36 For of these sort are they who creep into houses and lead captive
silly women laden with sins who are led away with divers desires

37 Ever learning and never attaining to the knowledge of the truth

38 Now as Jannes and Mambres resisted Moses so these also resist the
truth men corrupted in mind reprobate concerning the faith

Jannes and Mambres  The magicians of king Pharao

39 But they shall proceed no farther for their folly shall be
manifest to all men as theirs also was

310 But thou hast fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose
faith longsuffering love patience

311 Persecutions afflictions such as came upon me at Antioch at
Iconium and at Lystra what persecutions I endured and out of them all
the Lord delivered me

312 And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
persecution

313 But evil men and seducers shall grow worse and worse erring and
driving into error

314 But continue thou in those things which thou hast learned and
which have been committed to thee Knowing of whom thou hast learned
them

315 And because from thy infancy thou hast known the holy scriptures
which can instruct thee to salvation by the faith which is in Christ
Jesus

316 All scripture inspired of God is profitable to teach to
reprove to correct to instruct in justice

All scripture  Every part of divine scripture is certainly
profitable for all these ends But if we would have the whole rule of
Christian faith and practice we must not be content with those
Scriptures which Timothy knew from his infancy that is with the Old
Testament alone nor yet with the New Testament without taking along
with it the traditions of the apostles and the interpretation of the
church to which the apostles delivered both the book and the true
meaning of it

317 That the man of God may be perfect furnished to every good work



2 Timothy Chapter 4


His charge to Timothy He tells him of his approaching death and
desires him to come to him

41 I charge thee before God and Jesus Christ who shall judge the
living and the dead by his coming and his kingdom

42 Preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove
entreat rebuke in all patience and doctrine

43 For there shall be a time when they will not endure sound doctrine
but according to their own desires they will heap to themselves
teachers having itching ears

44 And will indeed turn away their hearing from the truth but will
be turned unto fables

45 But be thou vigilant labour in all things do the work of an
evangelist fulfil thy ministry Be sober

An evangelist  a diligent preacher of the gospel

46 For I am even now ready to be sacrificed and the time of my
dissolution is at hand

47 I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept
the faith

48 As to the rest there is laid up for me a crown of justice which
the Lord the just judge will render to me in that day and not only to
me but to them also that love his coming Make haste to come to me
quickly

49 For Demas hath left me loving this world and is gone to
Thessalonica

410 Crescens into Galatia Titus into Dalmatia

411 Only Luke is with me Take Mark and bring him with thee for he
is profitable to me for the ministry

412 But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus

413 The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when thou comest
bring with thee and the books especially the parchments

414 Alexander the coppersmith hath done me much evil the Lord will
reward him according to his works

415 Whom do thou also avoid for he hath greatly withstood our words

416 At my first answer no man stood with me but all forsook me May
it not be laid to their charge

417 But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me that by me the
preaching may be accomplished and that all the Gentiles may hear And I
was delivered out of the mouth of the lion

418 The Lord hath delivered me from every evil work and will preserve
me unto his heavenly kingdom To whom be glory for ever and ever Amen

419 Salute Prisca and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus

420 Erastus remained at Corinth And Trophimus I left sick at
Miletus

421 Make haste to come before winter Eubulus and Pudens and Linus
and Claudia and all the brethren salute thee

422 The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit Grace be with you
Amen




THE EPISTLE OF ST PAUL TO TITUS



St Paul having preached the faith in the island of Crete he ordained
his beloved disciple and companion Titus bishop and left him there
to finish the work which he had begun Afterwards the Apostle on a
journey to Nicopolis a city of Macedonia wrote this Epistle to Titus
in which he directs him to ordain bishops and priests for the different
cities shewing him the principal qualities necessary for a bishop He
also gives him particular advice for his own conduct to his flock
exhorting him to hold to strictness of discipline but seasoned with
lenity It was written about thirtythree years after our Lords
Ascension



Titus Chapter 1


What kind of men he is to ordain priests Some men are to be sharply
rebuked

11 Paul a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ according
to the faith of the elect of God and the acknowledging of the truth
which is according to godliness

12 Unto the hope of life everlasting which God who lieth not hath
promised before the times of the world

13 But hath in due times manifested his word in preaching which is
committed to me according to the commandment of God our Saviour

14 To Titus my beloved son according to the common faith grace and
peace from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Saviour

15 For this cause I left thee in Crete that thou shouldest set in
order the things that are wanting and shouldest ordain priests in every
city as I also appointed thee

16 If any be without crime the husband of one wife having faithful
children not accused of riot or unruly

17 For a bishop must be without crime as the steward of God not
proud not subject to anger nor given to wine no striker not greedy
of filthy lucre

18 But given to hospitality gentle sober just holy continent

19 Embracing that faithful word which is according to doctrine that
he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine and to convince the
gainsayers

110 For there are also many disobedient vain talkers and seducers
especially they who are of the circumcision

111 Who must be reproved who subvert whole houses teaching things
which they ought not for filthy lucres sake

112 One of them a prophet of their own said The Cretans are always
liars evil beasts slothful bellies

113 This testimony is true Wherefore rebuke them sharply that they
may be sound in the faith

114 Not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn
themselves away from the truth

115 All things are clean to the clean but to them that are defiled
and to unbelievers nothing is clean but both their mind and their
conscience are defiled

116 They profess that they know God but in their works they deny
him being abominable and incredulous and to every good work reprobate



Titus Chapter 2


How he is to instruct both old and young The duty of servants The
Christians rule of life

21 But speak thou the things that become sound doctrine

22 That the aged men be sober chaste prudent sound in faith in
love in patience

23 The aged women in like manner in holy attire not false
accusers not given to much wine teaching well

24 That they may teach the young women to be wise to love their
husbands to love their children

25 To be discreet chaste sober having a care of the house gentle
obedient to their husbands that the word of God be not blasphemed

26 Young men in like manner exhort that they be sober

27 In all things shew thyself an example of good works in doctrine
in integrity in gravity

28 The sound word that can not be blamed that he who is on the
contrary part may be afraid having no evil to say of us

29 Exhort servants to be obedient to their masters in all things
pleasing not gainsaying

210 Not defrauding but in all things shewing good fidelity that
they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things

211 For the grace of God our Saviour hath appeared to all men

212 Instructing us that denying ungodliness and worldly desires we
should live soberly and justly and godly in this world

213 Looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great
God and our Saviour Jesus Christ

214 Who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all
iniquity and might cleanse to himself a people acceptable a pursuer of
good works

215 These things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority Let
no man despise thee



Titus Chapter 3


Other instructions and directions for life and doctrine

31 Admonish them to be subject to princes and powers to obey at a
word to be ready to every good work

32 To speak evil of no man not to be litigious but gentle shewing
all mildness towards all men

33 For we ourselves also were some time unwise incredulous erring
slaves to divers desires and pleasures living in malice and envy
hateful and hating one another

34 But when the goodness and kindness of God our Saviour appeared

35 Not by the works of justice which we have done but according to
his mercy he saved us by the laver of regeneration and renovation of
the Holy Ghost

36 Whom he hath poured forth upon us abundantly through Jesus Christ
our Saviour

37 That being justified by his grace we may be heirs according to
hope of life everlasting

38 It is a faithful saying And these things I will have thee affirm
constantly that they who believe in God may be careful to excel in
good works These things are good and profitable unto men

39 But avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and
strivings about the law For they are unprofitable and vain

310 A man that is a heretic after the first and second admonition
avoid

311 Knowing that he that is such an one is subverted and sinneth
being condemned by his own judgment

By his own judgment  Other offenders are judged and cast out of the
church by the sentence of the pastors of the same church Heretics
more unhappy run out of the church of their own accord and by doing
so give judgment and sentence against their own souls

312 When I shall send to thee Artemas or Tychicus make haste to come
unto me to Nicopolis For there I have determined to winter

313 Send forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollo with care that nothing
be wanting to them

314 And let our men also learn to excel in good works for necessary
uses that they be not unfruitful

315 All that are with me salute thee Salute them that love us in the
faith The grace of God be with you all Amen




THE EPISTLE OF ST PAUL TO PHILEMON



Philemon a noble citizen of Colossa had a servant named Onesimus who
robbed him and fled to Rome where he met St Paul who was then a
prisoner there the first time The apostle took compassion on him and
received him with tenderness and converted him to the faith for he was
a Gentile before St Paul sends him back to his master with this
Epistle in his favour and though he beseeches Philemon to pardon him
yet the Apostle writes with becoming dignity and authority It contains
divers profitable instructions and points out the charity and humanity
that masters should have for their servants



Philemon Chapter 1


He commends the faith and charity of Philemon and sends back to him
his fugitive servant whom he had converted in prison

11 Paul a prisoner of Christ Jesus and Timothy a brother to
Philemon our beloved and fellow labourer

12 And to Appia our dearest sister and to Archippus our fellow
soldier and to the church which is in thy house

13 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord
Jesus Christ

14 I give thanks to my God always making a remembrance of thee in my
prayers

15 Hearing of thy charity and faith which thou hast in the Lord
Jesus and towards all the saints

16 That the communication of thy faith may be made evident in the
acknowledgment of every good work that is in you in Christ Jesus

17 For I have had great joy and consolation in thy charity because
the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee brother

18 Wherefore though I have much confidence in Christ Jesus to
command thee that which is to the purpose

19 For charity sake I rather beseech whereas thou art such a one as
Paul an old man and now a prisoner also of Jesus Christ

110 I beseech thee for my son whom I have begotten in my bands
Onesimus

111 Who hath been heretofore unprofitable to thee but now is
profitable both to me and thee

112 Whom I have sent back to thee And do thou receive him as my own
bowels

113 Whom I would have retained with me that in thy stead he might
have ministered to me in the bands of the gospel

114 But without thy counsel I would do nothing that thy good deed
might not be as it were of necessity but voluntary

115 For perhaps he therefore departed for a season from thee that
thou mightest receive him again for ever

116 Not now as a servant but instead of a servant a most dear
brother especially to me But how much more to thee both in the flesh
and in the Lord

117 If therefore thou count me a partner receive him as myself

118 And if he hath wronged thee in any thing or is in thy debt put
that to my account

119 I Paul have written it with my own hand I will repay it not to
say to thee that thou owest me thy own self also

120 Yea brother May I enjoy thee in the Lord Refresh my bowels in
the Lord

121 Trusting in thy obedience I have written to thee knowing that
thou wilt also do more than I say

122 But withal prepare me also a lodging For I hope that through
your prayers I shall be given unto you

123 There salute thee Epaphras my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus

124 Mark Aristarchus Demas and Luke my fellow labourers

125 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit Amen




THE EPISTLE OF ST PAUL TO THE HEBREWS



St Paul wrote this Epistle to the Christians in Palestine the most
part of whom being Jews before their conversion they were called
Hebrews He exhorts them to be thoroughly converted and confirmed in
the faith of Christ clearly shewing them the preeminence of Christs
priesthood above the Levitical and also the excellence of the new law
above the old He commends faith by the example of the ancient fathers
and exhorts them to patience and perseverance and to remain in
fraternal charity It appears from chap 13 that this Epistle was
written in Italy and probably at Rome about twentynine years after
our Lords Ascension



Hebrews Chapter 1


God spoke of old by the prophets but now by his Son who is
incomparably greater than the angels

11 God who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in times
past to the fathers by the prophets last of all

12 In these days hath spoken to us by his Son whom he hath
appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world

13 Who being the brightness of his glory and the figure of his
substance and upholding all things by the word of his power making
purgation of sins sitteth on the right hand of the majesty on high

The figure  that is the express image and most perfect resemblance
Making purgation  That is having purged away our sins by his
passion

14 Being made so much better than the angels as he hath inherited a
more excellent name than they

15 For to which of the angels hath he said at any time Thou art my
Son today have I begotten thee And again I will be to him a Father
and he shall be to me a Son

16 And again when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world
he saith And let all the angels of God adore him

17 And to the angels indeed he saith He that maketh his angels
spirits and his ministers a flame of fire

18 But to the Son Thy throne O God is for ever and ever a sceptre
of justice is the sceptre of thy kingdom

19 Thou hast loved justice and hated iniquity therefore God thy
God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows

110 And Thou in the beginning O Lord didst found the earth and
the works of thy hands are the heavens

111 They shall perish but thou shalt continue and they shall all
grow old as a garment

112 And as a vesture shalt thou change them and they shalt be
changed But thou art the selfsame and thy years shall not fail

113 But to which of the angels said he at any time Sit on my right
hand until I make thy enemies thy footstool

114 Are they not all ministering spirits sent to minister for them
who shall receive the inheritance of salvation



Hebrews Chapter 2


The transgression of the precepts of the Son of God is far more
condemnable than of those of the Old Testament given by angels

21 Therefore ought we more diligently to observe the things which we
have heard lest perhaps we should let them slip

22 For if the word spoken by angels became steadfast and every
transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward

23 How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation Which
having begun to be declared by the Lord was confirmed unto us by them
that heard him

24 God also bearing them witness by signs and wonders and divers
miracles and distributions of the Holy Ghost according to his own
will

25 For God hath not subjected unto angels the world to come whereof
we speak

26 But one in a certain place hath testified saying What is man
that thou art mindful of him Or the son of man that thou visitest
him

27 Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels thou hast
crowned him with glory and honour and hast set him over the works of
thy hands

28 Thou hast subjected all things under his feet For in that he hath
subjected all things to him he left nothing not subject to him But now
we see not as yet all things subject to him

29 But we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for
the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour that through
the grace of God he might taste death for all

210 For it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all
things who had brought many children into glory to perfect the author
of their salvation by his passion

Perfect by his passion  By suffering Christ was to enter into his
glory Luke 2426 which the apostle here calls being made perfect

211 For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all
of one For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren
saying

212 I will declare thy name to my brethren in the midst of the
church will I praise thee

213 And again I will put my trust in him And again Behold I and
my children whom God hath given me

214 Therefore because the children are partakers of flesh and blood
he also himself in like manner hath been partaker of the same that
through death he might destroy him who had the empire of death that
is to say the devil

215 And might deliver them who through the fear of death were all
their lifetime subject to servitude

216 For nowhere doth he take hold of the angels but of the seed of
Abraham he taketh hold

No where doth he etc  That is he never took upon him the nature of
angels but that of the seed of Abraham

217 Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his
brethren that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest
before God that he might be a propitiation for the sins of the people

218 For in that wherein he himself hath suffered and been tempted he
is able to succour them also that are tempted



Hebrews Chapter 3


Christ is more excellent than Moses Wherefore we must adhere to him by
faith and obedience

31 Wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly vocation
consider the apostle and high priest of our confession Jesus

32 Who is faithful to him that made him as was also Moses in all his
house

33 For this man was counted worthy of greater glory than Moses by so
much as he that hath built the house hath greater honour than the
house

34 For every house is built by some man but he that created all
things is God

35 And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant for a
testimony of those things which were to be said

36 But Christ as the Son in his own house which house are we if we
hold fast the confidence and glory of hope unto the end

37 Wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith Today if you shall hear his
voice

38 Harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of
temptation in the desert

39 Where your fathers tempted me proved and saw my works

310 Forty years for which cause I was offended with this generation
and I said They always err in heart And they have not known my ways

311 As I have sworn in my wrath If they shall enter into my rest

312 Take heed brethren lest perhaps there be in any of you an evil
heart of unbelief to depart from the living God

313 But exhort one another every day whilst it is called to day
that none of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin

314 For we are made partakers of Christ yet so if we hold the
beginning of his substance firm unto the end

315 While it is said To day if you shall hear his voice harden not
your hearts as in that provocation

316 For some who heard did provoke but not all that came out of
Egypt by Moses

317 And with whom was he offended forty years Was it not with them
that sinned whose carcasses were overthrown in the desert

318 And to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his
rest but to them that were incredulous

319 And we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief



Hebrews Chapter 4


The Christians rest We are to enter into it through Jesus Christ

41 Let us fear therefore lest the promise being left of entering
into his rest any of you should be thought to be wanting

42 For unto us also it hath been declared in like manner as unto
them But the word of hearing did not profit them not being mixed with
faith of those things they heard

43 For we who have believed shall enter into rest as he said As I
have sworn in my wrath If they shall enter into my rest and this
indeed when the works from the foundation of the world were finished

44 For in a certain place he spoke of the seventh day thus And God
rested the seventh day from all his works

45 And in this place again If they shall enter into my rest

46 Seeing then it remaineth that some are to enter into it and they
to whom it was first preached did not enter because of unbelief

47 Again he limiteth a certain day saying in David To day after so
long a time as it is above said To day if you shall hear his voice
harden not your hearts

48 For if Jesus had given them rest he would never have afterwards
spoken of another day

Jesus  Josue who in Greek is called Jesus

49 There remaineth therefore a day of rest for the people of God

410 For he that is entered into his rest the same also hath rested
from his works as God did from his

411 Let us hasten therefore to enter into that rest lest any man
fall into the same example of unbelief

412 For the word of God is living and effectual and more piercing
than any two edged sword and reaching unto the division of the soul
and the spirit of the joints also and the marrow and is a discerner
of the thoughts and intents of the heart

413 Neither is there any creature invisible in his sight but all
things are naked and open to his eyes to whom our speech is

414 Having therefore a great high priest that hath passed into the
heavens Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast our confession

415 For we have not a high priest who cannot have compassion on our
infirmities but one tempted in all things like as we are without sin

416 Let us go therefore with confidence to the throne of grace that
we may obtain mercy and find grace in seasonable aid



Hebrews Chapter 5


The office of a high priest Christ is our high priest

51 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in
the things that appertain to God that he may offer up gifts and
sacrifices for sins

52 Who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err
because he himself also is compassed with infirmity

53 And therefore he ought as for the people so also for himself to
offer for sins

54 Neither doth any man take the honour to himself but he that is
called by God as Aaron was

55 So Christ also did not glorify himself that he might be made a
high priest but he that said unto him Thou art my Son this day have
I begotten thee

56 As he saith also in another place Thou art a priest for ever
according to the order of Melchisedech

57 Who in the days of his flesh with a strong cry and tears
offering up prayers and supplications to him that was able to save him
from death was heard for his reverence

58 And whereas indeed he was the Son of God he learned obedience by
the things which he suffered

59 And being consummated he became to all that obey him the cause
of eternal salvation

510 Called by God a high priest according to the order of
Melchisedech

511 Of whom we have much to say and hard to be intelligibly uttered
because you are become weak to hear

512 For whereas for the time you ought to be masters you have need
to be taught again what are the first elements of the words of God and
you are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat

513 For every one that is a partaker of milk is unskilful in the word
of justice for he is a little child

514 But strong meat is for the perfect for them who by custom have
their senses exercised to the discerning of good and evil



Hebrews Chapter 6


He warns them of the danger of falling by apostasy and exhorts them to
patience and perseverance

61 Wherefore leaving the word of the beginning of Christ let us go
on to things more perfect not laying again the foundation of penance
from dead works and of faith towards God

The word of the beginning  The first rudiments of the Christian
doctrine

62 Of the doctrine of baptisms and imposition of hands and of the
resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment

63 And this will we do if God permit

64 For it is impossible for those who were once illuminated have
tasted also the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy
Ghost

It is impossible etc  The meaning is that it is impossible for such
as have fallen after baptism to be again baptized and very hard for
such as have apostatized from the faith after having received many
graces to return again to the happy state from which they fell

65 Have moreover tasted the good word of God and the powers of the
world to come

66 And are fallen away to be renewed again to penance crucifying
again to themselves the Son of God and making him a mockery

67 For the earth that drinketh in the rain which cometh often upon
it and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is tilled
receiveth blessing from God

68 But that which bringeth forth thorns and briers is reprobate and
very near unto a curse whose end is to be burnt

69 But my dearly beloved we trust better things of you and nearer
to salvation though we speak thus

610 For God is not unjust that he should forget your work and the
love which you have shewn in his name you who have ministered and do
minister to the saints

611 And we desire that every one of you shew forth the same
carefulness to the accomplishing of hope unto the end

612 That you become not slothful but followers of them who through
faith and patience shall inherit the promises

613 For God making promises to Abraham because he had no one greater
by whom he might swear swore by himself

614 Saying Unless blessing I shall bless thee and multiplying I
shall multiply thee

615 And so patiently enduring he obtained the promise

616 For men swear by one greater than themselves and an oath for
confirmation is the end of all their controversy

617 Wherein God meaning more abundantly to shew to the heirs of the
promise the immutability of his counsel interposed an oath

618 That by two immutable things in which it is impossible for God to
lie we may have the strongest comfort we who have fled for refuge to
hold fast the hope set before us

619 Which we have as an anchor of the soul sure and firm and which
entereth in even within the veil

620 Where the forerunner Jesus is entered for us made a high priest
for ever according to the order of Melchisedech



Hebrews Chapter 7


The priesthood of Christ according to the order of Melchisedech excels
the Levitical priesthood and puts an end both to that and to the law

71 For this Melchisedech was king of Salem priest of the most high
God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and
blessed him

72 To whom also Abraham divided the tithes of all who first indeed
by interpretation is king of justice and then also king of Salem that
is king of peace

73 Without father without mother without genealogy having neither
beginning of days nor end of life but likened unto the Son of God
continueth a priest for ever

Without father etc  Not that he had no father etc but that
neither his father nor his pedigree nor his birth nor his death are
set down in scripture

74 Now consider how great this man is to whom also Abraham the
patriarch gave tithes out of the principal things

75 And indeed they that are of the sons of Levi who receive the
priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according
to the law that is to say of their brethren though they themselves
also came out of the loins of Abraham

76 But he whose pedigree is not numbered among them received tithes
of Abraham and blessed him that had the promises

77 And without all contradiction that which is less is blessed by
the better

78 And here indeed men that die receive tithes but there he hath
witness that he liveth

79 And as it may be said even Levi who received tithes paid tithes
in Abraham

710 For he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchisedech met
him

711 If then perfection was by the Levitical priesthood for under it
the people received the law what further need was there that another
priest should rise according to the order of Melchisedech and not be
called according to the order of Aaron

712 For the priesthood being translated it is necessary that a
translation also be made of the law

713 For he of whom these things are spoken is of another tribe of
which no one attended on the altar

714 For it is evident that our Lord sprung out of Juda in which
tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priests

715 And it is yet far more evident if according to the similitude of
Melchisedech there ariseth another priest

716 Who is made not according to the law of a law of a carnal
commandment but according to the power of an indissoluble life

717 For he testifieth Thou art a priest for ever according to the
order of Melchisedech

718 There is indeed a setting aside of the former commandment
because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof

719 For the law brought nothing to perfection but a bringing in of a
better hope by which we draw nigh to God

720 And inasmuch as it is not without an oath for the others indeed
were made priests without an oath

721 But this with an oath by him that said unto him The Lord hath
sworn and he will not repent Thou art a priest for ever

722 By so much is Jesus made a surety of a better testament

723 And the others indeed were made many priests because by reason
of death they were not suffered to continue

Many priests etc  The apostle notes this difference between the high
priests of the law and our high priest Jesus Christ that they being
removed by death made way for their successors whereas our Lord Jesus
is a priest for ever and hath no successor but liveth and concurreth
for ever with his ministers the priests of the new testament in all
their functions Also that no one priest of the law nor all of them
together could offer that absolute sacrifice of everlasting
redemption which our one high priest Jesus Christ has offered once
and for ever

724 But this for that he continueth for ever hath an everlasting
priesthood

725 Whereby he is able also to save for ever them that come to God by
him always living to make intercession for us

Make intercession  Christ as man continually maketh intercession
for us by representing his passion to his Father

726 For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest holy
innocent undefiled separated from sinners and made higher than the
heavens

727 Who needeth not daily as the other priests to offer sacrifices
first for his own sins and then for the peoples for this he did
once in offering himself

728 For the law maketh men priests who have infirmity but the word
of the oath which was since the law the Son who is perfected for
evermore



Hebrews Chapter 8


More of the excellence of the priesthood of Christ and of the New
Testament

81 Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum We have
such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of
majesty in the heavens

82 A minister of the holies and of the true tabernacle which the
Lord hath pitched and not man

The holies  That is the sanctuary

83 For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices
wherefore it is necessary that he also should have some thing to offer

84 If then he were on earth he would not be a priest seeing that
there would be others to offer gifts according to the law

If then he were on earth etc  That is if he were not of a higher
condition than the Levitical order of earthly priests and had not
another kind of sacrifice to offer he should be excluded by them from
the priesthood and its functions which by the law were appropriated
to their tribe

85 Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things As it
was answered to Moses when he was to finish the tabernacle See saith
he that thou make all things according to the pattern which was shewn
thee on the mount

Who serve unto etc  The priesthood of the law and its functions were
a kind of an example and shadow of what is done by Christ in his church
militant and triumphant of which the tabernacle was a pattern

86 But now he hath obtained a better ministry by how much also he is
a mediator of a better testament which is established on better
promises

87 For if that former had been faultless there should not indeed a
place have been sought for a second

88 For finding fault with them he saith Behold the days shall
come saith the Lord and I will perfect unto the house of Israel and
unto the house of Juda a new testament

89 Not according to the testament which I made to their fathers on
the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of
Egypt because they continued not in my testament and I regarded them
not saith the Lord

810 For this is the testament which I will make to the house of
Israel after those days saith the Lord I will give my laws into their
mind and in their heart will I write them And I will be their God
and they shall be my people

811 And they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man
his brother saying Know the Lord For all shall know me from the
least to the greatest of them

They shall not teach etc  So great shall be light and grace of the
new testament that it shall not be necessary to inculcate to the
faithful the belief and knowledge of the true God for they shall all
know him

812 Because I will be merciful to their iniquities and their sins I
will remember no more

813 Now in saying a new he hath made the former old And that which
decayeth and groweth old is near its end

A new  Supply covenant



Hebrews Chapter 9


The sacrifices of the law were far inferior to that of Christ

91 The former indeed had also justifications of divine service and a
sanctuary

92 For there was a tabernacle made the first wherein were the
candlesticks and the table and the setting forth of loaves which is
called the Holy

93 And after the second veil the tabernacle which is called the Holy
of Holies

94 Having a golden censer and the ark of the testament covered about
on every part with gold in which was a golden pot that had manna and
the rod of Aaron that had blossomed and the tables of the testament

95 And over it were the cherubims of glory overshadowing the
propitiatory of which it is not needful to speak now particularly

96 Now these things being thus ordered into the first tabernacle
the priests indeed always entered accomplishing the offices of
sacrifices

97 But into the second the high priest alone once a year not
without blood which he offereth for his own and the peoples
ignorance

98 The Holy Ghost signifying this That the way into the Holies was
not yet made manifest whilst the former tabernacle was yet standing

99 Which is a parable of the time present according to which gifts
and sacrifices are offered which cannot as to the conscience make
him perfect that serveth only in meats and in drinks

910 And divers washings and justices of the flesh laid on them until
the time of correction

Of correction  Viz when Christ should correct and settle all
things

911 But Christ being come an high Priest of the good things to come
by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand that is
not of this creation

912 Neither by the blood of goats or of calves but by his own blood
entered once into the Holies having obtained eternal redemption

Eternal redemption  By that one sacrifice of his blood once offered
on the cross Christ our Lord paid and exhibited once for all the
general price and ransom of all mankind which no other priest could
do

913 For if the blood of goats and of oxen and the ashes of an
heifer being sprinkled sanctify such as are defiled to the cleansing
of the flesh

914 How much more shall the blood of Christ who by the Holy Ghost
offered himself unspotted unto God cleanse our conscience from dead
works to serve the living God

915 And therefore he is the mediator of the new testament that by
means of his death for the redemption of those transgressions which
were under the former testament they that are called may receive the
promise of eternal inheritance

916 For where there is a testament the death of the testator must of
necessity come in

917 For a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is
as yet of no strength whilst the testator liveth

918 Whereupon neither was the first indeed dedicated without blood

919 For when every commandment of the law had been read by Moses to
all the people he took the blood of calves and goats with water and
scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book itself and all the
people

920 Saying This is the blood of the testament which God hath
enjoined unto you

921 The tabernacle also and all the vessels of the ministry in like
manner he sprinkled with blood

922 And almost all things according to the law are cleansed with
blood and without shedding of blood there is no remission

923 It is necessary therefore that the patterns of heavenly things
should be cleansed with these but the heavenly things themselves with
better sacrifices than these

924 For Jesus is not entered into the Holies made with hands the
patterns of the true but into Heaven itself that he may appear now in
the presence of God for us

925 Nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest
entereth into the Holies every year with the blood of others

Offer himself often  Christ shall never more offer himself in
sacrifice in that violent painful and bloody manner nor can there
be any occasion for it since by that one sacrifice upon the cross he
has furnished the full ransom redemption and remedy for all the sins
of the world But this hinders not that he may offer himself daily in
the sacred mysteries in an unbloody manner for the daily application
of that one sacrifice of redemption to our souls

926 For then he ought to have suffered often from the beginning of
the world But now once at the end of ages he hath appeared for the
destruction of sin by the sacrifice of himself

927 And as it is appointed unto men once to die and after this the
judgment

928 So also Christ was offered once to exhaust the sins of many The
second time he shall appear without sin to them that expect him unto
salvation

To exhaust  That is to empty or draw out to the very bottom by a
plentiful and perfect redemption



Hebrews Chapter 10


Because of the insufficiency of the sacrifices of the law Christ our
high priest shed his own blood for us offering up once for all the
sacrifice of our redemption He exhorts them to perseverance

101 For the law having a shadow of the good things to come not the
very image of the things by the selfsame sacrifices which they offer
continually every year can never make the comers thereunto perfect

102 For then they would have ceased to be offered because the
worshippers once cleansed should have no conscience of sin any longer

They would have ceased  If they had been of themselves perfect to all
the intents of redemption and remission as Christs death is there
would have been no occasion of so often repeating them as there is no
occasion for Christs dying any more for our sins

103 But in them there is made a commemoration of sins every year

104 For it is impossible that with the blood of oxen and goats sin
should be taken away

105 Wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith Sacrifice and
oblation thou wouldest not but a body thou hast fitted to me

106 Holocausts for sin did not please thee

107 Then said I Behold I come in the head of the book it is written
of me that I should do thy will O God

108 In saying before Sacrifices and oblations and holocausts for
sin thou wouldest not neither are they pleasing to thee which are
offered according to the law

109 Then said I Behold I come to do thy will O God He taketh away
the first that he may establish that which followeth

1010 In the which will we are sanctified by the oblation of the body
of Jesus Christ once

1011 And every priest indeed standeth daily ministering and often
offering the same sacrifices which can never take away sins

1012 But this man offering one sacrifice for sins for ever sitteth
on the right hand of God

1013 From henceforth expecting until his enemies be made his
footstool

1014 For by one oblation he hath perfected for ever them that are
sanctified

1015 And the Holy Ghost also doth testify this to us For after that
he said

1016 And this is the testament which I will make unto them after
those days saith the Lord I will give my laws in their hearts and on
their minds will I write them

1017 And their sins and iniquities I will remember no more

1018 Now where there is a remission of these there is no more an
oblation for sin

There is no more an oblation for sin  Where there is a full remission
of sins as in baptism there is no more occasion for a sin offering to
be made for such sins already remitted and as for sins committed
afterwards they can only be remitted in virtue of the one oblation of
Christs death

1019 Having therefore brethren a confidence in the entering into
the holies by the blood of Christ

1020 A new and living way which he hath dedicated for us through the
veil that is to say his flesh

1021 And a high priest over the house of God

1022 Let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith having
our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with
clean water

1023 Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering
for he is faithful that hath promised

1024 And let us consider one another to provoke unto charity and to
good works

1025 Not forsaking our assembly as some are accustomed but
comforting one anther and so much the more as you see the day
approaching

1026 For if we sin wilfully after having the knowledge of the truth
there is now left no sacrifice for sins

If we sin wilfully  He speaks of the sin of wilful apostasy from the
known truth after which as we can not be baptized again we can not
expect to have that abundant remission of sins which Christ purchased
by his death applied to our souls in that ample manner as it is in
baptism but we have rather all manner of reason to look for a dreadful
judgment the more because apostates from the known truth seldom or
never have the grace to return to it

1027 But a certain dreadful expectation of judgment and the rage of
a fire which shall consume the adversaries

1028 A man making void the law of Moses dieth without any mercy under
two or three witnesses

1029 How much more do you think he deserveth worse punishments who
hath trodden under foot the Son of God and hath esteemed the blood of
the testament unclean by which he was sanctified and hath offered an
affront to the Spirit of grace

1030 For we know him that hath said Vengeance belongeth to me and I
will repay And again The Lord shall judge his people

1031 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God

1032 But call to mind the former days wherein being illuminated
you endured a great fight of afflictions

1033 And on the one hand indeed by reproaches and tribulations were
made a gazingstock and on the other became companions of them that
were used in such sort

1034 For you both had compassion on them that were in bands and took
with joy the being stripped of your own goods knowing that you have a
better and a lasting substance

1035 Do not therefore lose your confidence which hath a great reward

1036 For patience is necessary for you that doing the will of God
you may receive the promise

1037 For yet a little and a very little while and he that is to come
will come and will not delay

1038 But my just man liveth by faith but if he withdraw himself he
shall not please my soul

1039 But we are not the children of withdrawing unto perdition but
of faith to the saving of the soul



Hebrews Chapter 11


What faith is Its wonderful fruits and efficacy demonstrated in the
fathers

111 Now faith is the substance of things to be hoped for the
evidence of things that appear not

112 For by this the ancients obtained a testimony

113 By faith we understand that the world was framed by the word of
God that from invisible things visible things might be made

114 By faith Abel offered to God a sacrifice exceeding that of Cain
by which he obtained a testimony that he was just God giving testimony
to his gifts And by it he being dead yet speaketh

115 By faith Henoch was translated that he should not see death and
he was not found because God had translated him For before his
translation he had testimony that he pleased God

116 But without faith it is impossible to please God For he that
cometh to God must believe that he is and is a rewarder to them that
seek him

117 By faith Noe having received an answer concerning those things
which as yet were not seen moved with fear framed the ark for the
saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and was
instituted heir of the justice which is by faith

118 By faith he that is called Abraham obeyed to go out into a place
which he was to receive for an inheritance And he went out not
knowing whither he went

He that is called Abraham  or Abraham being called

119 By faith he abode in the land of promise as in a strange
country dwelling in cottages with Isaac and Jacob the coheirs of
the same promise

1110 For he looked for a city that hath foundations whose builder
and maker is God

1111 By faith also Sara herself being barren received strength to
conceive seed even past the time of age because she believed that he
was faithful who had promised

1112 For which cause there sprung even from one and him as good as
dead as the stars of heaven in multitude and as the sand which is by
the sea shore innumerable

1113 All these died according to faith not having received the
promises but beholding them afar off and saluting them and confessing
that they are pilgrims and strangers on the earth

1114 For they that say these things do signify that they seek a
country

1115 And truly if they had been mindful of that from whence they
came out they had doubtless time to return

1116 But now they desire a better that is to say a heavenly
country Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he
hath prepared for them a city

1117 By faith Abraham when he was tried offered Isaac and he that
had received the promises offered up his only begotten son

1118 To whom it was said In Isaac shalt thy seed be called

1119 Accounting that God is able to raise up even from the dead
Whereupon also he received him for a parable

For a parable  That is as a figure of Christ slain and coming to
life again

1120 By faith also of things to come Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau

1121 By faith Jacob dying blessed each of the sons of Joseph and
adored the top of his rod

Adored the top of his rod  The apostle here follows the ancient Greek
Bible of the seventy interpreters which translates in this manner
Gen 47 31 and alleges this fact of Jacob in paying a relative
honour and veneration to the top of the rod or sceptre of Joseph as to
a figure of Christs sceptre and kingdom as an instance and argument
of his faith But some translators who are no friends to this relative
honour have corrupted the text by translating it he worshipped
leaning upon the top of his staff as if this circumstance of leaning
upon his staff were any argument of Jacobs faith or worthy the being
thus particularly taken notice of by the Holy Ghost

1122 By faith Joseph when he was dying made mention of the going
out of the children of Israel and gave commandment concerning his
bones

1123 By faith Moses when he was born was hid three months by his
parents because they saw he was a comely babe and they feared not the
kings edict

1124 By faith Moses when he was grown up denied himself to be the
son of Pharaos daughter

1125 Rather choosing to be afflicted with the people of God than to
have the pleasure of sin for a time

1126 Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the
treasure of the Egyptians For he looked unto the reward

1127 By faith he left Egypt not fearing the fierceness of the king
for he endured as seeing him that is invisible

1128 By faith he celebrated the pasch and the shedding of the blood
that he who destroyed the firstborn might not touch them

1129 By faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land which
the Egyptians attempting were swallowed up

1130 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down by the going round them
seven days

1131 By faith Rahab the harlot perished not with the unbelievers
receiving the spies with peace

1132 And what shall I yet say For the time would fail me to tell of
Gedeon Barac Samson Jephthe David Samuel and the prophets

1133 Who by faith conquered kingdoms wrought justice obtained
promises stopped the mouths of lions

1134 Quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword
recovered strength from weakness became valiant in battle put to
flight the armies of foreigners

1135 Women received their dead raised to life again But others were
racked not accepting deliverance that they might find a better
resurrection

1136 And others had trial of mockeries and stripes moreover also of
bands and prisons

1137 They were stoned they were cut asunder they were tempted they
were put to death by the sword they wandered about in sheepskins in
goatskins being in want distressed afflicted

1138 Of whom the world was not worthy wandering in deserts in
mountains and in dens and in caves of the earth

1139 And all these being approved by the testimony of faith
received not the promise

1140 God providing some better thing for us that they should not be
perfected without us



Hebrews Chapter 12


Exhortation to constancy under their crosses The danger of abusing the
graces of the New Testament

121 And therefore we also having so great a cloud of witnesses over
our head laying aside every weight and sin which surrounds us let us
run by patience to the fight proposed to us

122 Looking on Jesus the author and finisher of faith who having
joy set before him endured the cross despising the shame and now
sitteth on the right hand of the throne of God

123 For think diligently upon him that endured such opposition from
sinners against himself that you be not wearied fainting in your
minds

124 For you have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin

125 And you have forgotten the consolation which speaketh to you as
unto children saying My son neglect not the discipline of the Lord
neither be thou wearied whilst thou art rebuked by him

126 For whom the Lord loveth he chastiseth and he scourgeth every
son whom he receiveth

127 Persevere under discipline God dealeth with you as with his
sons For what son is there whom the father doth not correct

128 But if you be without chastisement whereof all are made
partakers then are you bastards and not sons

129 Moreover we have had fathers of our flesh for instructors and
we reverenced them Shall we not much more obey the Father of spirits
and live

1210 And they indeed for a few days according to their own pleasure
instructed us but he for our profit that we might receive his
sanctification

1211 Now all chastisement for the present indeed seemeth not to bring
with it joy but sorrow but afterwards it will yield to them that are
exercised by it the most peaceable fruit of justice

1212 Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble
knees

1213 And make straight steps with your feet that no one halting
may go out of the way but rather be healed

1214 Follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man
shall see God

1215 Looking diligently lest any man be wanting to the grace of God
lest any root of bitterness springing up do hinder and by it many be
defiled

1216 Lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for
one mess sold his first birthright

1217 For know ye that afterwards when he desired to inherit the
benediction he was rejected For he found no place of repentance
although with tears he had sought it

He found etc  That is he found no way to bring his father to
repent or change his mind with relation to his having given the
blessing to his younger brother Jacob

1218 For you are not come to a mountain that might be touched and a
burning fire and a whirlwind and darkness and storm

1219 And the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which they
that had excused themselves that the word might not be spoken to them

1220 For they did not endure that which was said and if so much as a
beast shall touch the mount it shall be stoned

1221 And so terrible was that which was seen Moses said I am
frighted and tremble

1222 But you are come to mount Sion and to the city of the living
God the heavenly Jerusalem and to the company of many thousands of
angels

1223 And to the church of the firstborn who are written in the
heavens and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of the just
made perfect

1224 And to Jesus the mediator of the new testament and to the
sprinkling of blood which speaketh better than that of Abel

1225 See that you refuse him not that speaketh For if they escaped
not who refused him that spoke upon earth much more shall not we that
turn away from him that speaketh to us from heaven

1226 Whose voice then moved the earth but now he promiseth saying
Yet once more and I will move not only the earth but heaven also

1227 And in that he saith Yet once more he signifieth the
translation of the moveable things as made that those things may
remain which are immoveable

1228 Therefore receiving an immoveable kingdom we have grace
whereby let us serve pleasing God with fear and reverence

1229 For our God is a consuming fire



Hebrews Chapter 13


Divers admonitions and exhortations

131 Let the charity of the brotherhood abide in you

132 And hospitality do not forget for by this some being not aware
of it have entertained angels

133 Remember them that are in bands as if you were bound with them
and them that labour as being yourselves also in the body

134 Marriage honourable in all and the bed undefiled For
fornicators and adulterers God will judge

Or Let marriage be honourable in all  That is in all things
belonging to the marriage state This is a warning to married people
not to abuse the sanctity of their state by any liberties or
irregularities contrary thereunto Now it does not follow from this
text that all persons are obliged to marry even if the word omnibus
were rendered in all persons instead of in all things for if it was
a precept St Paul himself would have transgressed it as he never
married Moreover those who have already made a vow to God to lead a
single life should they attempt to marry they would incur their own
damnation 1 Tim 5 12

135 Let your manners be without covetousness contented with such
things as you have For he hath said I will not leave thee neither
will I forsake thee

136 So that we may confidently say The Lord is my helper I will not
fear what man shall do to me

137 Remember your prelates who have spoken the word of God to you
whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation

138 Jesus Christ yesterday and today and the same for ever

139 Be not led away with various and strange doctrines For it is
best that the heart be established with grace not with meats which
have not profited those that walk in them

1310 We have an altar whereof they have no power to eat who serve the
tabernacle

1311 For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the
holies by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp

1312 Wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people by his
own blood suffered without the gate

1313 Let us go forth therefore to him without the camp bearing his
reproach

Let us go forth therefore to him without the camp bearing his
reproach  That is bearing his cross It is an exhortation to them to
be willing to suffer with Christ reproaches persecutions and even
death if they desire to partake of the benefit of his suffering for
mans redemption

1314 For we have not here a lasting city but we seek one that is to
come

1315 By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise always to
God that is to say the fruit of lips confessing to his name

1316 And do not forget to do good and to impart for by such
sacrifices Gods favour is obtained

1317 Obey your prelates and be subject to them For they watch as
being to render an account of your souls that they may do this with
joy and not with grief For this is not expedient for you

1318 Pray for us For we trust we have a good conscience being
willing to behave ourselves well in all things

1319 And I beseech you the more to do this that I may be restored to
you the sooner

1320 And may the God of peace who brought again from the dead the
great pastor of the sheep our Lord Jesus Christ in the blood of the
everlasting testament

1321 Fit you in all goodness that you may do his will doing in you
that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ to whom
is glory for ever and ever Amen

1322 And I beseech you brethren that you suffer this word of
consolation For I have written to you in a few words

1323 Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty with whom
if he come shortly I will see you

1324 Salute all your prelates and all the saints The brethren from
Italy salute you

1325 Grace be with you all Amen




THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST JAMES THE APOSTLE



This Epistle is called Catholic or Universal as formerly were also the
two Epistles of St Peter the first of St John and that of St Jude
because they were not written to any peculiar people or particular
person but to the faithful in general It was written by the apostle
St James called the Less who was also called the brother of our
Lord being his kinsman for cousins german with the Hebrews were
called brothers He was the first Bishop of Jerusalem In this Epistle
are set forth many precepts appertaining to faith and morals
particularly that faith without good works will not save a man and
that true wisdom is given only from above In the fifth chapter he
publishes the sacrament of anointing the sick It was written a short
time before his martyrdom about twentyeight years after our Lords
Ascension



James Chapter 1


The benefit of tribulations Prayer with faith God is the author of
all good but not of evil We must be slow to anger and not hearers
only but doers of the word Of bridling the tongue and of pure
religion

11 James the servant of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ to the
twelve tribes which are scattered abroad greeting

12 My brethren count it all joy when you shall fall into divers
temptations

Into divers temptations  The word temptation in this epistle is
sometimes taken for trials by afflictions or persecutions as in this
place at other times it is to be understood tempting enticing or
drawing others into sin

13 Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience

14 And patience hath a perfect work that you may be perfect and
entire failing in nothing

15 But if any of you want wisdom let him ask of God who giveth to
all men abundantly and upbraideth not And it shall be given him

16 But let him ask in faith nothing wavering For he that wavereth
is like a wave of the sea which is moved and carried about by the
wind

17 Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing
of the Lord

18 A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways

19 But let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation

110 And the rich in his being low because as the flower of the
grass shall he pass away

111 For the sun rose with a burning heat and parched the grass and
the flower thereof fell off and the beauty of the shape thereof
perished So also shall the rich man fade away in his ways

112 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he hath
been proved he shall receive the crown of life which God hath promised
to them that love him

113 Let no man when he is tempted say that he is tempted by God
For God is not a tempter of evils and he tempteth no man

114 But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence being drawn
away and allured

115 Then when concupiscence hath conceived it bringeth forth sin
But sin when it is completed begetteth death

116 Do not err therefore my dearest brethren

117 Every best gift and every perfect gift is from above coming down
from the Father of lights with whom there is no change nor shadow of
alteration

118 For of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth
that we might be some beginning of his creature

Some beginning  That is a kind of first fruits of his creatures

119 You know my dearest brethren And let every man be swift to
hear but slow to speak and slow to anger

120 For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God

121 Wherefore casting away all uncleanness and abundance of
naughtiness with meekness receive the ingrafted word which is able to
save your souls

122 But be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your
own selves

123 For if a man be a hearer of the word and not a doer he shall be
compared to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass

124 For he beheld himself and went his way and presently forgot what
manner of man he was

125 But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty and hath
continued therein not becoming a forgetful hearer but a doer of the
work this man shall be blessed in his deed

126 And if any man think himself to be religious not bridling his
tongue but deceiving his own heart this mans religion is vain

127 Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father is this
to visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation and to keep
ones self unspotted from this world



James Chapter 2


Against respect of persons The danger of transgressing one point of
the law Faith is dead without works

21 My brethren have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory
with respect of persons

With respect of persons  The meaning is that in matters relating to
faith the administering of the sacraments and other spiritual
functions in Gods church there should be no respect of persons but
that the souls of the poor should be as much regarded as those of the
rich See Deut 117

22 For if there shall come into your assembly a man having a golden
ring in fine apparel and there shall come in also a poor man in mean
attire

23 And you have respect to him that is clothed with the fine apparel
and shall say to him Sit thou here well but say to the poor man
Stand thou there or Sit under my footstool

24 Do you not judge within yourselves and are become judges of
unjust thoughts

25 Hearken my dearest brethren Hath not God chosen the poor in this
world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised
to them that love him

26 But you have dishonoured the poor man Do not the rich oppress you
by might And do not they draw you before the judgment seats

27 Do not they blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you

28 If then you fulfil the royal law according to the scriptures
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself you do well

29 But if you have respect to persons you commit sin being reproved
by the law as transgressors

210 And whosoever shall keep the whole law but offend in one point
is become guilty of all

Guilty of all  That is he becomes a transgressor of the law in such
a manner that the observing of all other points will not avail him to
salvation for he despises the lawgiver and breaks through the great
and general commandment of charity even by one mortal sin For all the
precepts of the law are to be considered as one total and entire law
and as it were a chain of precepts where by breaking one link of this
chain the whole chain is broken or the integrity of the law
consisting of a collection of precepts A sinner therefore by a
grievous offence against any one precept incurs eternal punishment
yet the punishment in hell shall be greater for those who have been
greater sinners as a greater reward shall be for those in heaven who
have lived with greater sanctity and perfection

211 For he that said Thou shalt not commit adultery said also Thou
shalt not kill Now if thou do not commit adultery but shalt kill
thou art become a transgressor of the law

212 So speak ye and so do as being to be judged by the law of
liberty

213 For judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy And
mercy exalteth itself above judgment

214 What shall it profit my brethren if a man say he hath faith
but hath not works Shall faith be able to save him

215 And if a brother or sister be naked and want daily food

216 And one of you say to them Go in peace be ye warmed and filled
yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body what
shall it profit

217 So faith also if it have not works is dead in itself

218 But some man will say Thou hast faith and I have works Shew me
thy faith without works and I will shew thee by works my faith

219 Thou believest that there is one God Thou dost well the devils
also believe and tremble

220 But wilt thou know O vain man that faith without works is dead

221 Was not Abraham our father justified by works offering up Isaac
his son upon the altar

222 Seest thou that faith did cooperate with his works and by works
faith was made perfect

223 And the scripture was fulfilled saying Abraham believed God
and it was reputed to him to justice and he was called the friend of
God

224 Do you see that by works a man is justified and not by faith
only

225 And in like manner also Rahab the harlot was not she justified
by works receiving the messengers and sending them out another way

226 For even as the body without the spirit is dead so also faith
without works is dead



James Chapter 3


Of the evils of the tongue Of the difference between the earthly and
heavenly wisdom

31 Be ye not many masters my brethren knowing that you receive the
greater judgment

32 For in many things we all offend If any man offend not in word
the same is a perfect man He is able also with a bridle to lead about
the whole body

33 For if we put bits into the mouths of horses that they may obey
us and we turn about their whole body

34 Behold also ships whereas they are great and are driven by strong
winds yet are they turned about with a small helm whithersoever the
force of the governor willeth

35 Even so the tongue is indeed a little member and boasteth great
things Behold how small a fire kindleth a great wood

36 And the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity The tongue is
placed among our members which defileth the whole body and inflameth
the wheel of our nativity being set on fire by hell

37 For every nature of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of the
rest is tamed and hath been tamed by the nature of man

38 But the tongue no man can tame an unquiet evil full of deadly
poison

39 By it we bless God and the Father and by it we curse men who are
made after the likeness of God

310 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing My
brethren these things ought not so to be

311 Doth a fountain send forth out of the same hole sweet and
bitter water

312 Can the fig tree my brethren bear grapes Or the vine figs So
neither can the salt water yield sweet

313 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you Let him
shew by a good contestation his work in the meekness of wisdom

314 But if you have bitter zeal and there be contention in your
hearts glory not and be not liars against the truth

315 For this is not wisdom descending from above but earthly
sensual devilish

316 For where envying and contention is there is inconstancy and
every evil work

317 But the wisdom that is from above first indeed is chaste then
peaceable modest easy to be persuaded consenting to the good full
of mercy and good fruits without judging without dissimulation

318 And the fruit of justice is sown in peace to them that make
peace



James Chapter 4


The evils that flow from yielding to concupiscence and being friends to
this world Admonitions against pride detraction and the like

41 From whence are wars and contentions among you Are they not
hence from your concupiscences which war in your members

42 You covet and have not you kill and envy and cannot obtain You
contend and war and you have not because you ask not

43 You ask and receive not because you ask amiss that you may
consume it on your concupiscences

44 Adulterers know you not that the friendship of this world is the
enemy of God Whosoever therefore will be a friend of this world
becometh an enemy of God

45 Or do you think that the scripture saith in vain To envy doth the
spirit covet which dwelleth in you

46 But he giveth greater grace Wherefore he saith God resisteth the
proud and giveth grace to the humble

47 Be subject therefore to God But resist the devil and he will fly
from you

48 Draw nigh to God and he will draw nigh to you Cleanse your
hands ye sinners and purify your hearts ye double minded

49 Be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned into
mourning and your joy into sorrow

410 Be humbled in the sight of the Lord and he will exalt you

411 Detract not one another my brethren He that detracteth his
brother or he that judgeth his brother detracteth the law and judgeth
the law But if thou judge the law thou art not a doer of the law but
a judge

412 There is one lawgiver and judge that is able to destroy and to
deliver

413 But who art thou that judgest thy neighbour Behold now you that
say Today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and there we will
spend a year and will traffic and make our gain

414 Whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow

415 For what is your life It is a vapour which appeareth for a
little while and afterwards shall vanish away For that you should say
If the Lord will and If we shall live we will do this or that

416 But now you rejoice in your arrogancies All such rejoicing is
wicked

417 To him therefore who knoweth to do good and doth it not to him
it is sin



James Chapter 5


A woe to the rich that oppress the poor Exhortations to patience and
to avoid swearing Of the anointing the sick confession of sins and
fervour in prayer

51 Go to now ye rich men weep and howl in your miseries which
shall come upon you

52 Your riches are corrupted and your garments are motheaten

53 Your gold and silver is cankered and the rust of them shall be
for a testimony against you and shall eat your flesh like fire You
have stored up to yourselves wrath against the last days

54 Behold the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields
which by fraud has been kept back by you crieth and the cry of them
hath entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth

55 You have feasted upon earth and in riotousness you have nourished
your hearts in the day of slaughter

56 You have condemned and put to death the Just One and he resisted
you not

57 Be patient therefore brethren until the coming of the Lord
Behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth
patiently bearing till he receive the early and latter rain

58 Be you therefore also patient and strengthen your hearts for the
coming of the Lord is at hand

59 Grudge not brethren one against another that you may not be
judged Behold the judge standeth before the door

510 Take my brethren for example of suffering evil of labour and
patience the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord

511 Behold we account them blessed who have endured You have heard
of the patience of Job and you have seen the end of the Lord that the
Lord is merciful and compassionate

512 But above all things my brethren swear not neither by heaven
nor by the earth nor by any other oath But let your speech be Yea
Yea No No that you fall not under judgment

513 Is any of you sad Let him pray Is he cheerful in mind Let him
sing

514 Is any man sick among you Let him bring in the priests of the
church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name
of the Lord

Let him bring in etc  See here a plain warrant of scripture for the
sacrament of extreme unction that any controversy against its
institution would be against the express words of the sacred text in
the plainest terms

515 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick man And the Lord
shall raise him up and if he be in sins they shall be forgiven him

516 Confess therefore your sins one to another and pray one for
another that you may be saved For the continual prayer of a just man
availeth much

Confess your sins one to another  That is to the priests of the
church whom ver14 he had ordered to be called for and brought in
to the sick moreover to confess to persons who had no power to
forgive sins would be useless Hence the precept here means that we
must confess to men whom God hath appointed and who by their
ordination and jurisdiction have received the power of remitting sins
in his name

517 Elias was a man passible like unto us and with prayer he prayed
that it might not rain upon the earth And it rained not for three
years and six months

518 And he prayed again And the heaven gave rain and the earth
brought forth her fruit

519 My brethren if any of you err from the truth and one convert
him

520 He must know that he who causeth a sinner to be converted from
the error of his way shall save his soul from death and shall cover a
multitude of sins




THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST PETER THE APOSTLE



The first Epistle of St Peter though brief contains much doctrine
concerning Faith Hope and Charity with divers instructions to all
persons of what state or condition soever The Apostle commands
submission to rulers and superiors and exhorts all to the practice of a
virtuous life in imitation of Christ This Epistle is written with
such apostolical dignity as to manifest the supreme authority with
which its writer the Prince of the Apostles had been vested by his
Lord and Master Jesus Christ He wrote it at Rome which figuratively
he calls Babylon about fifteen years after our Lords Ascension



1 Peter Chapter 1


He gives thanks to God for the benefit of our being called to the true
faith and to eternal life into which we are to enter by many
tribulations He exhorts to holiness of life considering the holiness
of God and our redemption by the blood of Christ

11 Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to the strangers dispersed
through Pontus Cappadocia Asia and Bithynia elect

12 According to the foreknowledge of God the Father unto the
sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the
blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multiplied

13 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
according to his great mercy hath regenerated us unto a lively hope by
the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead

14 Unto an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that cannot
fade reserved in heaven for you

15 Who by the power of God are kept by faith unto salvation ready
to be revealed in the last time

16 Wherein you shalt greatly rejoice if now you must be for a little
time made sorrowful in divers temptations

17 That the trial of your faith much more precious than gold which
is tried by the fire may be found unto praise and glory and honour at
the appearing of Jesus Christ

18 Whom having not seen you love in whom also now though you see
him not you believe and believing shall rejoice with joy unspeakable
and glorified

19 Receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls

110 Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and diligently
searched who prophesied of the grace to come in you

111 Searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in
them did signify when it foretold those sufferings that are in Christ
and the glories that should follow

112 To whom it was revealed that not to themselves but to you they
ministered those things which are now declared to you by them that have
preached the gospel to you the Holy Ghost being sent down from heaven
on whom the angels desire to look

113 Wherefore having the loins of your mind girt up being sober
trust perfectly in the grace which is offered you in the revelation of
Jesus Christ

114 As children of obedience not fashioned according to the former
desires of your ignorance

115 But according to him that hath called you who is holy be you
also in all manner of conversation holy

116 Because it is written You shall be holy for I am holy

117 And if you invoke as Father him who without respect of persons
judgeth according to every ones work converse in fear during the time
of your sojourning here

118 Knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as
gold or silver from your vain conversation of the tradition of your
fathers

119 But with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb unspotted and
undefiled

120 Foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world but
manifested in the last times for you

121 Who through him are faithful in God who raised him up from the
dead and hath given him glory that your faith and hope might be in
God

122 Purifying your souls in the obedience of charity with a
brotherly love from a sincere heart love one another earnestly

123 Being born again not of corruptible seed but incorruptible by
the word of God who liveth and remaineth for ever

124 For all flesh is as grass and all the glory thereof as the flower
of grass The grass is withered and the flower thereof is fallen away

125 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever And this is the word
which by the gospel hath been preached unto you



1 Peter Chapter 2


We are to lay aside all guile and go to Christ the living stone and
as being now his people walk worthily of him with submission to
superiors and patience under sufferings

21 Wherefore laying away all malice and all guile and dissimulations
and envies and all detractions

22 As newborn babes desire the rational milk without guile that
thereby you may grow unto salvation

23 If so be you have tasted that the Lord is sweet

24 Unto whom coming as to a living stone rejected indeed by men but
chosen and made honourable by God

25 Be you also as living stones built up a spiritual house a holy
priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by
Jesus Christ

26 Wherefore it is said in the scripture Behold I lay in Sion a
chief corner stone elect precious And he that shall believe in him
shall not be confounded

27 To you therefore that believe he is honour but to them that
believe not the stone which the builders rejected the same is made
the head of the corner

28 And a stone of stumbling and a rock of scandal to them who
stumble at the word neither do believe whereunto also they are set

29 But you are a chosen generation a kingly priesthood a holy
nation a purchased people that you may declare his virtues who hath
called you out of darkness into his marvelous light

210 Who in times past were not a people but are now the people of
God Who had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy

211 Dearly beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims to
refrain yourselves from carnal desires which war against the soul

212 Having your conversation good among the Gentiles that whereas
they speak against you as evildoers they may by the good works which
they shall behold in you glorify God in the day of visitation

213 Be ye subject therefore to every human creature for Gods sake
whether it be to the king as excelling

214 Or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers
and for the praise of the good

215 For so is the will of God that by doing well you may put to
silence the ignorance of foolish men

216 As free and not as making liberty a cloak for malice but as the
servants of God

217 Honour all men Love the brotherhood Fear God Honour the king

218 Servants be subject to your masters with all fear not only to
the good and gentle but also to the froward

219 For this is thankworthy if for conscience towards God a man
endure sorrows suffering wrongfully

220 For what glory is it if committing sin and being buffeted for
it you endure But if doing well you suffer patiently this is
thankworthy before God

221 For unto this are you called because Christ also suffered for
us leaving you an example that you should follow his steps

222 Who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth

223 Who when he was reviled did not revile when he suffered he
threatened not but delivered himself to him that judged him unjustly

224 Who his own self bore our sins in his body upon the tree that
we being dead to sins should live to justice by whose stripes you
were healed

225 For you were as sheep going astray but you are now converted to
the shepherd and bishop of your souls



1 Peter Chapter 3


How wives are to behave to their husbands What ornaments they are to
seek Exhortations to divers Virtues

31 In like manner also let wives be subject to their husbands that
if any believe not the word they may be won without the word by the
conversation of the wives

32 Considering your chaste conversation with fear

33 Whose adorning let it not be the outward plaiting of the hair or
the wearing of gold or the putting on of apparel

34 But the hidden man of the heart in the incorruptibility of a
quiet and a meek spirit which is rich in the sight of God

35 For after this manner heretofore the holy women also who trusted
in God adorned themselves being in subjection to their own husbands

36 As Sara obeyed Abraham calling him lord whose daughters you are
doing well and not fearing any disturbance

37 Ye husbands likewise dwelling with them according to knowledge
giving honour to the female as to the weaker vessel and as to the
coheirs of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered

38 And in fine be ye all of one mind having compassion one of
another being lovers of the brotherhood merciful modest humble

39 Not rendering evil for evil nor railing for railing but
contrariwise blessing for unto this are you called that you may
inherit a blessing

310 For he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his
tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile

311 Let him decline from evil and do good Let him seek after peace
and pursue it

312 Because the eyes of the Lord are upon the just and his ears unto
their prayers but the countenance of the Lord upon them that do evil
things

313 And who is he that can hurt you if you be zealous of good

314 But if also you suffer any thing for justice sake blessed are
ye And be not afraid of their fear and be not troubled

315 But sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts being ready always
to satisfy every one that asketh you a reason of that hope which is in
you

316 But with modesty and fear having a good conscience that whereas
they speak evil of you they may be ashamed who falsely accuse your
good conversation in Christ

317 For it is better doing well if such be the will of God to
suffer than doing ill

318 Because Christ also died once for our sins the just for the
unjust that he might offer us to God being put to death indeed in the
flesh but enlivened in the spirit

319 In which also coming he preached to those spirits that were in
prison

Spirits that were in prison  See here a proof of a third place or
middle state of souls for these spirits in prison to whom Christ went
to preach after his death were not in heaven nor yet in the hell of
the damned because heaven is no prison and Christ did not go to
preach to the damned

320 Which had been some time incredulous when they waited for the
patience of God in the days of Noe when the ark was a building
wherein a few that is eight souls were saved by water

321 Whereunto baptism being of the like form now saveth you also
not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the examination of
a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ

Whereunto baptism etc  Baptism is said to be of the like form with
the water by which Noe was saved because the one was a figure of the
other Not the putting away etc  As much as to say that baptism
has not its efficacy in order to salvation from its washing away any
bodily filth or dirt but from its purging the conscience from sin
when accompanied with suitable dispositions in the party to answer the
interrogations made at that time with relation to faith the
renouncing of Satan with all his works and the obedience to Gods
commandments

322 Who is on the right hand of God swallowing down death that we
might be made heirs of life everlasting being gone into heaven the
angels and powers and virtues being made subject to him



1 Peter Chapter 4


Exhortations to cease from sin to mutual charity to do all for the
glory of God to be willing to suffer for Christ

41 Christ therefore having suffered in the flesh be you also armed
with the same thought for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath
ceased from sins

42 That now he may live the rest of his time in the flesh not after
the desires of men but according to the will of God

43 For the time past is sufficient to have fulfilled the will of the
Gentiles for them who have walked in riotousness lusts excess of
wine revellings banquetings and unlawful worshipping of idols

44 Wherein they think it strange that you run not with them into the
same confusion of riotousness speaking evil of you

45 Who shall render account to him who is ready to judge the living
and the dead

46 For for this cause was the gospel preached also to the dead That
they might be judged indeed according to men in the flesh but may
live according to God in the Spirit

47 But the end of all is at hand Be prudent therefore and watch in
prayers

48 But before all things have a constant mutual charity among
yourselves for charity covereth a multitude of sins

49 Using hospitality one towards another without murmuring

410 As every man hath received grace ministering the same one to
another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God

411 If any man speak let him speak as the words of God If any
minister let him do it as of the power which God administereth that
in all things God may be honoured through Jesus Christ to whom is
glory and empire for ever and ever Amen

412 Dearly beloved think not strange the burning heat which is to
try you as if some new thing happened to you

413 But if you partake of the sufferings of Christ rejoice that
when his glory shall be revealed you may also be glad with exceeding
joy

414 If you be reproached for the name of Christ you shall be
blessed for that which is of the honour glory and power of God and
that which is his Spirit resteth upon you

415 But let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or a railer
or coveter of other mens things

416 But if as a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him
glorify God in that name

417 For the time is that judgment should begin at the house of God
And if at first at us what shall be the end of them that believe not
the gospel of God

418 And if the just man shall scarcely be saved where shall the
ungodly and the sinner appear

Scarcely  That is not without much labour and difficulty and
because of the dangers which constantly surround the temptations of
the world of the devil and of our own corrupt nature

419 Wherefore let them also that suffer according to the will of God
commend their souls in good deeds to the faithful Creator



1 Peter Chapter 5


He exhorts both priests and laity to their respective duties and
recommends to all humility and watchfulness

51 The ancients therefore that are among you I beseech who am myself
also an ancient and a witness of the sufferings of Christ as also a
partaker of that glory which is to be revealed in time to come

52 Feed the flock of God which is among you taking care of it not
by constraint but willingly according to God not for filthy lucres
sake but voluntarily

53 Neither as lording it over the clergy but being made a pattern of
the flock from the heart

54 And when the prince of pastors shall appear you shall receive a
never fading crown of glory

55 In like manner ye young men be subject to the ancients And do
you all insinuate humility one to another for God resisteth the proud
but to the humble he giveth grace

56 Be you humbled therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may
exalt you in the time of visitation

57 Casting all your care upon him for he hath care of you

58 Be sober and watch because your adversary the devil as a roaring
lion goeth about seeking whom he may devour

59 Whom resist ye strong in faith knowing that the same affliction
befalls your brethren who are in the world

510 But the God of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal
glory in Christ Jesus after you have suffered a little will himself
perfect you and confirm you and establish you

511 To him be glory and empire for ever and ever Amen

512 By Sylvanus a faithful brother unto you as I think I have
written briefly beseeching and testifying that this is the true grace
of God wherein you stand

513 The church that is in Babylon elected together with you
saluteth you And so doth my son Mark

514 Salute one another with a holy kiss Grace be to all you who are
in Christ Jesus Amen




THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST PETER THE APOSTLE



In this Epistle St Peter says chap 3 Behold this second Epistle I
write to you and before chap 1 14 Being assured that the laying
away of this my tabernacle is at hand This shews that it was written a
very short time before his martyrdom which was about thirtyfive years
after our Lords Ascension In this Epistle he admonishes the faithful
to be mindful of the great gifts they received from God and to join all
other virtues with their faith He warns them against false teachers
by describing their practices and foretelling their punishments He
describes the dissolution of this world by fire and the day of
judgment



2 Peter Chapter 1


He exhorts them to join all other virtues with their faith in order to
secure their salvation

11 Simon Peter servant and apostle of Jesus Christ to them that
have obtained equal faith with us in the justice of our God and Saviour
Jesus Christ

12 Grace to you and peace be accomplished in the knowledge of God and
of Christ Jesus our Lord

13 As all things of his divine power which appertain to life and
godliness are given us through the knowledge of him who hath called us
by his own proper glory and virtue

14 By whom he hath given us most great and precious promises that by
these you may be made partakers of the divine nature flying the
corruption of that concupiscence which is in the world

15 And you employing all care minister in your faith virtue And
in virtue knowledge

16 And in knowledge abstinence and in abstinence patience and in
patience godliness

17 And in godliness love of brotherhood and in love of brotherhood
charity

18 For if these things be with you and abound they will make you to
be neither empty nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
Christ

19 For he that hath not these things with him is blind and groping
having forgotten that he was purged from his old sins

110 Wherefore brethren labour the more that by good works you may
make sure your calling and election For doing these things you shall
not sin at any time

111 For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the
everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ

112 For which cause I will begin to put you always in remembrance of
these things though indeed you know them and are confirmed in the
present truth

113 But I think it meet as long as I am in this tabernacle to stir
you up by putting you in remembrance

114 Being assured that the laying away of this my tabernacle is at
hand according as our Lord Jesus Christ also hath signified to me

115 And I will endeavour that you frequently have after my decease
whereby you may keep a memory of these things

116 For we have not by following artificial fables made known to you
the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ but we were
eyewitnesses of his greatness

117 For he received from God the Father honour and glory this voice
coming down to him from the excellent glory This is my beloved Son in
whom I am well pleased Hear ye him

118 And this voice we heard brought from heaven when we were with
him in the holy mount

119 And we have the more firm prophetical word whereunto you do well
to attend as to a light that shineth in a dark place until the day
dawn and the day star arise in your hearts

120 Understanding this first That no prophecy of scripture is made
by private interpretation

No prophecy of scripture is made by private interpretation  This
shows plainly that the scriptures are not to be expounded by any ones
private judgment or private spirit because every part of the holy
scriptures were written by men inspired by the Holy Ghost and declared
as such by the Church therefore they are not to be interpreted but by
the Spirit of God which he hath left and promised to remain with his
Church to guide her in all truth to the end of the world Some may tell
us that many of our divines interpret the scriptures they may do so
but they do it always with a submission to the judgment of the Church
and not otherwise

121 For prophecy came not by the will of man at any time but the
holy men of God spoke inspired by the Holy Ghost



2 Peter Chapter 2


He warns them against false teachers and foretells their punishment

21 But there were also false prophets among the people even as there
shall be among you lying teachers who shall bring in sects of perdition
and deny the Lord who bought them bringing upon themselves swift
destruction

Seeds of perdition  That is heresies destructive of salvation

22 And many shall follow their riotousness through whom the way of
truth shall be evil spoken of

23 And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make
merchandise of you Whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not
and their perdition slumbereth not

24 For if God spared not the angels that sinned but delivered them
drawn down by infernal ropes to the lower hell unto torments to be
reserved unto judgment

25 And spared not the original world but preserved Noe the eighth
person the preacher of justice bringing in the flood upon the world
of the ungodly

26 And reducing the cities of the Sodomites and of the Gomorrhites
into ashes condemned them to be overthrown making them an example to
those that should after act wickedly

27 And delivered just Lot oppressed by the injustice and lewd
conversation of the wicked

28 For in sight and hearing he was just dwelling among them who from
day to day vexed the just soul with unjust works

29 The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly from temptation but to
reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be tormented

210 And especially them who walk after the flesh in the lust of
uncleanness and despise government audacious self willed they fear
not to bring in sects blaspheming

211 Whereas angels who are greater in strength and power bring not
against themselves a railing judgment

Bring not a railing judgment etc  That is they use no railing nor
cursing sentence not even in their conflicts with the evil angels See
St Jude ver 9

212 But these men as irrational beasts naturally tending to the
snare and to destruction blaspheming those things which they know not
shall perish in their corruption

213 Receiving the reward of their injustice counting for a pleasure
the delights of a day stains and spots sporting themselves to excess
rioting in their feasts with you

The delights of a day that is the short delights of this world in
which they place all their happiness

214 Having eyes full of adultery and of sin that ceaseth not
alluring unstable souls having their heart exercised with
covetousness children of malediction

215 Leaving the right way they have gone astray having followed the
way of Balaam of Bosor who loved the wages of iniquity

216 But had a check of his madness the dumb beast used to the yoke
which speaking with mans voice forbade the folly of the prophet

217 These are fountains without water and clouds tossed with
whirlwinds to whom the mist of darkness is reserved

218 For speaking proud words of vanity they allure by the desires
of fleshly riotousness those who for a little while escape such as
converse in error

219 Promising them liberty whereas they themselves are the slaves of
corruption For by whom a man is overcome of the same also he is the
slave

220 For if flying from the pollutions of the world through the
knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ they be again entangled
in them and overcome their latter state is become unto them worse than
the former

221 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of
justice than after they have known it to turn back from that holy
commandment which was delivered to them

222 For that of the true proverb has happened to them The dog is
returned to his vomit and The sow that was washed to her wallowing in
the mire



2 Peter Chapter 3


Against scoffers denying the second coming of Christ He declares the
sudden dissolution of this world and exhorts to holiness of life

31 Behold this second epistle I write to you my dearly beloved in
which I stir up by way of admonition your sincere mind

32 That you may be mindful of those words which I told you before
from the holy prophet and of your apostles of the precepts of the Lord
and Saviour

33 Knowing this first That in the last days there shall come
deceitful scoffers walking after their own lusts

34 Saying Where is his promise or his coming For since the time
that the fathers slept all things continue as they were from the
beginning of the creation

35 For this they are wilfully ignorant of That the heavens were
before and the earth out of water and through water consisting by the
word of God

36 Whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water
perished

37 But the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are
kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and
perdition of the ungodly men

38 But of this one thing be not ignorant my beloved that one day
with the Lord is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day

39 The Lord delayeth not his promise as some imagine but dealeth
patiently for your sake not willing that any should perish but that
all should return to penance

310 But the day of the Lord shall come as a thief in which the
heavens shall pass away with great violence and the elements shall be
melted with heat and the earth and the works which are in it shall be
burnt up

311 Seeing then that all these things are to be dissolved what
manner of people ought you to be in holy conversation and godliness

312 Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of the Lord
by which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements
shall melt with the burning heat

313 But we look for new heavens and a new earth according to his
promises in which justice dwelleth

314 Wherefore dearly beloved waiting for these things be diligent
that you may be found before him unspotted and blameless in peace

315 And account the longsuffering of our Lord salvation as also our
most dear brother Paul according to the wisdom given him hath written
to you

316 As also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things in
which are certain things hard to be understood which the unlearned and
unstable wrest as they do also the other scriptures to their own
destruction

317 You therefore brethren knowing these things before take heed
lest being led aside by the error of the unwise you fall from your own
steadfastness

318 But grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ To him be glory both now and unto the day of eternity
Amen




THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST JOHN THE APOSTLE



The same vein of divine love and charity towards our neighbour which
runs throughout the Gospel written by the beloved disciple and
Evangelist St John is found also in his Epistles He confirms the
two principal mysteries of faith The mystery of the Trinity and the
mystery of the incarnation of Jesus Christ the Son of God The
sublimity and excellence of the evangelical doctrine he declares And
this commandment we have from God that he who loveth God love also
his brother chap 421 And again For this is the charity of God
that we keep his commandments and His commandments are not heavy
chap 53 He shews how to distinguish the children of God from those
of the devil marks out those who should be called Antichrists
describes the turpitude and gravity of sin Finally he shews how the
sinner may hope for pardon It was written according to Baronius
account sixtysix years after our Lords Ascension



1 John Chapter 1


He declares what he has seen and heard of Christ who is the life
eternal to the end that we may have fellowship with God and all good
through him Yet so if we confess our sins

11 That which was from the beginning which we have heard which we
have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have
handled of the word of life

12 For the life was manifested and we have seen and do bear witness
and declare unto you the life eternal which was with the Father and
hath appeared to us

13 That which we have seen and have heard we declare unto you that
you also may have fellowship with us and our fellowship may be with the
Father and with his Son Jesus Christ

14 And these things we write to you that you may rejoice and your
joy may be full

15 And this is the declaration which we have heard from him and
declare unto you That God is light and in him there is no darkness

16 If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness
we lie and do not the truth

17 But if we walk in the light as he also is in the light we have
fellowship one with another And the blood of Jesus Christ his Son
cleanseth us from all sin

18 If we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth
is not in us

19 If we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our
sins and to cleanse us from all iniquity

110 If we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his
word is not in us



1 John Chapter 2


Christ is our advocate We must keep his commandments and love one
another We must not love the world nor give ear to new teachers but
abide by the spirit of God in the church

21 My little children these things I write to you that you may not
sin But if any man sin we have an advocate with the Father Jesus
Christ the just

22 And he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only
but also for those of the whole world

23 And by this we know that we have known him if we keep his
commandments

We have known him if we keep his commandments  He speaks of that
practical knowledge by love and affection which can only be proved by
our keeping his commandments and without which we can not be said to
know God as we should do

24 He who saith that he knoweth him and keepeth not his commandments
is a liar and the truth is not in him

25 But he that keepeth his word in him in very deed the charity of
God is perfected And by this we know that we are in him

26 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as
he walked

27 Dearly beloved I write not a new commandment to you but an old
commandment which you had from the beginning The old commandment is
the word which you have heard

28 Again a new commandment I write unto you which thing is true both
in him and in you because the darkness is passed and the true light
now shineth

A new commandment  Viz the commandment of love which was first
given in the old law but was renewed and extended by Christ See John
1334

29 He that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in
darkness even until now

210 He that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is no
scandal in him

211 But he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in
darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth because the darkness hath
blinded his eyes

212 I write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven
you for his names sake

213 I write unto you fathers because you have known him who is from
the beginning I write unto you young men because you have overcome
the wicked one

214 I write unto you babes because you have known the Father I
write unto you young men because you are strong and the word of God
abideth in you and you have overcome the wicked one

215 Love not the world nor the things which are in the world If any
man love the world the charity of the Father is not in him

216 For all that is in the world is the concupiscence of the flesh
and the concupiscence of the eyes and the pride of life which is not
of the Father but is of the world

217 And the world passeth away and the concupiscence thereof but he
that doth the will of God abideth for ever

218 Little children it is the last hour and as you have heard that
Antichrist cometh even now there are become many Antichrists whereby
we know that it is the last hour

It is the last hour  That is it is the last age of the world Many
Antichrists  that is many heretics enemies of Christ and his
church and forerunners of the great Antichrist

219 They went out from us but they were not of us For if they had
been of us they would no doubt have remained with us but that they
may be manifest that they are not all of us

They were not of us  That is they were not solid steadfast genuine
Christians otherwise they would have remained in the church

220 But you have the unction from the Holy One and know all things

The unction from the Holy One  That is grace and wisdom from the
Holy Ghost Know all things  The true children of Gods church
remaining in unity under the guidance of their lawful pastors partake
of the grace of the Holy Ghost promised to the church and her pastors
and have in the church all necessary knowledge and instruction so as
to have no need to seek it elsewhere since it can be only found in
that society of which they are members

221 I have not written to you as to them that know not the truth but
as to them that know it and that no lie is of the truth

222 Who is a liar but he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ This
is Antichrist who denieth the Father and the Son

223 Whosoever denieth the Son the same hath not the Father He that
confesseth the Son hath the Father also

224 As for you let that which you have heard from the beginning
abide in you If that abide in you which you have heard from the
beginning you also shall abide in the Son and in the Father

225 And this is the promise which he hath promised us life
everlasting

226 These things have I written to you concerning them that seduce
you

227 And as for you let the unction which you have received from him
abide in you And you have no need that any man teach you but as his
unction teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie And as
it hath taught you abide in him

You have no need etc  You want not to be taught by any of these men
who under pretence of imparting more knowledge to you seek to seduce
you ver 26 since you are sufficiently taught already and have all
knowledge and grace in the church with the unction of the Holy Ghost
which these new teachers have no share in

228 And now little children abide in him that when he shall appear
we may have confidence and not be confounded by him at his coming

229 If you know that he is just know ye that every one also who
doth justice is born of him



1 John Chapter 3


Of the love of God to us How we may distinguish the children of God
and those of the devil Of loving one another and of purity of
conscience

31 Behold what manner of charity the Father hath bestowed upon us
that we should be called and should be the sons of God Therefore the
world knoweth not us because it knew not him

32 Dearly beloved we are now the sons of God and it hath not yet
appeared what we shall be We know that when he shall appear we shall
be like to him because we shall see him as he is

33 And every one that hath this hope in him sanctifieth himself as
he also is holy

34 Whosoever committeth sin committeth also iniquity And sin is
iniquity

Iniquity  transgression of the law

35 And you know that he appeared to take away our sins and in him
there is no sin

36 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not and whosoever sinneth hath
not seen him nor known him

Sinneth not  viz mortally See chap 18

37 Little children let no man deceive you He that doth justice is
just even as he is just

38 He that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from
the beginning For this purpose the Son of God appeared that he might
destroy the works of the devil

39 Whosoever is born of God committeth not sin for his seed abideth
in him And he cannot sin because he is born of God

Committeth not sin  That is as long as he keepeth in himself this
seed of grace and this divine generation by which he is born of God
But then he may fall from this happy state by the abuse of his free
will as appears from Rom 112022 Cor 927 and 1012 Phil 212
Apoc 311

310 In this the children of God are manifest and the children of the
devil Whosoever is not just is not of God or he that loveth not his
brother

311 For this is the declaration which you have heard from the
beginning that you should love one another

312 Not as Cain who was of the wicked one and killed his brother
And wherefore did he kill him Because his own works were wicked and
his brothers just

313 Wonder not brethren if the world hate you

314 We know that we have passed from death to life because we love
the brethren He that loveth not abideth in death

315 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer And you know that no
murderer hath eternal life abiding in himself

316 In this we have known the charity of God because he hath laid
down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the
brethren

317 He that hath the substance of this world and shall see his
brother in need and shall shut up his bowels from him how doth the
charity of God abide in him

318 My little children let us not love in word nor in tongue but in
deed and in truth

319 In this we know that we are of the truth and in his sight shall
persuade our hearts

320 For if our heart reprehend us God is greater than our heart and
knoweth all things

321 Dearly beloved if our heart do not reprehend us we have
confidence towards God

322 And whatsoever we shall ask we shall receive of him because we
keep his commandments and do those things which are pleasing in his
sight

323 And this is his commandment That we should believe in the name
of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another as he hath given
commandment unto us

324 And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him and he in
him And in this we know that he abideth in us by the Spirit which he
hath given us



1 John Chapter 4


What spirits are of God and what are not We must love one another
because God has loved us

41 Dearly beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits if
they be of God because many false prophets are gone out into the
world

Try the spirits  Viz by examining whether their teaching be
agreeable to the rule of the Catholic faith and the doctrine of the
church For as he says ver 6 He that knoweth God heareth us the
pastors of the church By this we know the spirit of truth and the
spirit of error

42 By this is the spirit of God known Every spirit which confesseth
that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God

Every spirit which confesseth etc  Not that the confession of this
point of faith alone is at all times and in all cases sufficient
but that with relation to that time and for that part of the Christian
doctrine which was then particularly to be confessed taught and
maintained against the heretics of those days this was the most proper
token by which the true teachers might be distinguished form the
false

43 And every spirit that dissolveth Jesus is not of God And this is
Antichrist of whom you have heard that he cometh and he is now
already in the world

That dissolveth Jesus  Viz either by denying his humanity or his
divinity He is now already in the world  Not in his person but in
his spirit and in his precursors

44 You are of God little children and have overcome him Because
greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world

45 They are of the world Therefore of the world they speak and the
world heareth them

46 We are of God He that knoweth God heareth us He that is not of
God heareth us not By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit
of error

47 Dearly beloved let us love one another for charity is of God
And every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God

48 He that loveth not knoweth not God for God is charity

49 By this hath the charity of God appeared towards us because God
hath sent his only begotten Son into the world that we may live by
him

410 In this is charity not as though we had loved God but because
he hath first loved us and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our
sins

411 My dearest if God hath so loved us we also ought to love one
another

412 No man hath seen God at any time If we love one another God
abideth in us and his charity is perfected in us

413 In this we know that we abide in him and he in us because he
hath given us of his spirit

414 And we have seen and do testify that the Father hath sent his Son
to be the Saviour of the world

415 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God God abideth
in him and he in God

416 And we have known and have believed the charity which God hath to
us God is charity and he that abideth in charity abideth in God and
God in him

417 In this is the charity of God perfected with us that we may have
confidence in the day of judgment because as he is we also are in
this world

418 Fear is not in charity but perfect charity casteth out fear
because fear hath sin And he that feareth is not perfected in charity

Fear is not in charity etc  Perfect charity or love banisheth
human fear that is the fear of men as also all perplexing fear
which makes men mistrust or despair of Gods mercy and that kind of
servile fear which makes them fear the punishment of sin more than the
offence offered to God But it no way excludes the wholesome fear of
Gods judgments so often recomended in holy writ nor that fear and
trembling with which we are told to work out our salvation Phil
212

419 Let us therefore love God because God first hath loved us

420 If any man say I love God and hateth his brother he is a liar
For he that loveth not his brother whom he seeth how can he love God
whom he seeth not

421 And this commandment we have from God that he who loveth God
love also his brother



1 John Chapter 5


Of them that are born of God and of true charity Faith overcomes the
world Three that bear witness to Christ Of faith in his name and of
sin that is and is not to death

51 Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God And
every one that loveth him who begot loveth him also who is born of
him

Is born of God  That is is justified and become a child of God by
baptism which is also to be understood provided the belief of this
fundamental article of the Christian faith be accompanied with all the
other conditions which by the word of God and his appointment are
also required to justification such as a general belief of all that
God has revealed and promised hope love repentance and a sincere
disposition to keep Gods holy law and commandments

52 In this we know that we love the children of God when we love God
and keep his commandments

53 For this is the charity of God That we keep his commandments And
his commandments are not heavy

54 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world And this is
the victory which overcameth the world Our faith

Our faith  Not a bare speculative or dead faith but a faith that
worketh by charity Gal 56

55 Who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that
Jesus is the Son of God

56 This is he that came by water and blood Jesus Christ not by
water only but by water and blood And it is the Spirit which
testifieth that Christ is the truth

Came by water and blood  Not only to wash away our sins by the water
of baptism but by his own blood

57 And there are Three who give testimony in heaven the Father the
Word and the Holy Ghost And these three are one

58 And there are three that give testimony on earth the spirit and
the water and the blood And these three are one

The spirit and the water and the blood  As the Father the Word
and the Holy Ghost all bear witness to Christs divinity so the
spirit which he yielded up crying out with a loud voice upon the
cross and the water and blood that issued from his side bear witness
to his humanity and are one that is all agree in one testimony

59 If we receive the testimony of men the testimony of God is
greater For this is the testimony of God which is greater because he
hath testified of his Son

510 He that believeth in the Son of God hath the testimony of God in
himself He that believeth not the Son maketh him a liar because he
believeth not in the testimony which God hath testified of his Son

He that believeth not the Son etc  By refusing to believe the
testimonies given by the three divine persons that Jesus was the
Messias and the true Son of God by whom eternal life is obtained and
promised to all that comply with his doctrine In him we have also this
lively confidence that we shall obtain whatever we ask according to
his will when we ask what is for our good with perseverance and in
the manner we ought And this we know and have experience of by
having obtained the petitions that we have made

511 And this is the testimony that God hath given to us eternal life
And this life is in his Son

512 He that hath the Son hath life He that hath not the Son hath not
life

513 These things I write to you that you may know that you have
eternal life you who believe in the name of the Son of God

514 And this is the confidence which we have towards him That
whatsoever we shall ask according to his will he heareth us

515 And we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask we know that we
have the petitions which we request of him

516 He that knoweth his brother to sin a sin which is not to death
let him ask and life shall be given to him who sinneth not to death
There is a sin unto death For that I say not that any man ask

A sin which is not to death etc  It is hard to determine what St
John here calls a sin which is not to death and a sin which is unto
death The difference can not be the same as betwixt sins that are
called venial and mortal for he says that if a man pray for his
brother who commits a sin that is not to death life shall be given
him therefore such a one had before lost the life of grace and been
guilty of what is commonly called a mortal sin And when he speaks of a
sin that is unto death and adds these words for that I say not that
any man ask it cannot be supposed that St John would say this of
every mortal sin but only of some heinous sins which are very seldom
remitted because such sinners very seldom repent By a sin therefore
which is unto death interpreters commonly understand a wilfull
apostasy from the faith and from the known truth when a sinner
hardened by his own ingratitude becomes deaf to all admonitions will
do nothing for himself but runs on to a final impenitence Nor yet
does St John say that such a sin is never remitted or cannot be
remitted but only has these words for that I say not that any man ask
the remission  that is though we must pray for all sinners
whatsoever yet men can not pray for such sinners with such a
confidence of obtaining always their petitions as St John said
before ver 14 Whatever exposition we follow on this verse our faith
teacheth us from the holy scriptures that God desires not the death of
any sinner but that he be converted and live Ezech 3311 Though
mens sins be as red as scarlet they shall become as white as snow
Isa 318 It is the will of God that every one come to the knowledge
of the truth and be saved There is no sin so great but which God is
willing to forgive and has left a power in his church to remit the
most enormous sins so that no sinner need despair of pardon nor will
any sinner perish but by his own fault A sin unto death  Some
understand this of final impenitence or of dying in mortal sin which
is the only sin that never can be remitted But it is probable he may
also comprise under this name the sin of apostasy from the faith and
some other such heinous sins as are seldom and hardly remitted and
therefore he gives little encouragement to such as pray for these
sinners to expect what they ask

517 All iniquity is sin And there is a sin unto death

518 We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not but the
generation of God preserveth him and the wicked one toucheth him not

519 We know that we are of God and the whole world is seated in
wickedness

And the whole world is seated in wickedness  That is a great part of
the world It may also signify is under the wicked one meaning the
devil who is elsewhere called the prince of this world that is of
all the wicked John 1231

520 And we know that the Son of God is come And he hath given us
understanding that we may know the true God and may be in his true Son
This is the true God and life eternal

And may be in his true Son He is or this is the true God and life
eternal  Which words are a clear proof of Christs divinity and as
such made use of by the ancient fathers

521 Little children keep yourselves from idols Amen

Keep yourselves from idols  An admonition to the newly converted
Christians lest conversing with heathens and idolaters they might
fall back into the sin of idolatry which may be the sin unto death
here mentioned by St John




THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST JOHN THE APOSTLE



The Apostle commends Electa and her family for their steadfastness in
the true faith and exhorts them to persevere lest they lose the reward
of their labours He exhorts them to love one another But with
heretics to have no society even not to salute them Although this
Epistle is written to a particular person yet its instructions may
serve as a lesson to others especially to those who from their
connections situation or condition in life are in danger of
perversion



2 John Chapter 1


He recommends walking in truth loving one another and to beware of
false teachers

11 The Ancient to the lady Elect and her children whom I love in the
truth and not I only but also all they that have known the truth

The ancient  That is the ancient bishop St John being the only one
of the twelve apostles then living To the lady Elect  Some
conjecture that Electa might be the name of a family or of a
particular church but the general opinion is that it is the proper
name of a lady so eminent for her piety and great charity as to merit
this Epistle from St John

12 For the sake of the truth which dwelleth in us and shall be with
us for ever

13 Grace be with you mercy and peace from God the Father and from
Christ Jesus the Son of the Father in truth and charity

14 I was exceeding glad that I found of thy children walking in
truth as we have received a commandment from the Father

15 And now I beseech thee lady not as writing a new commandment to
thee but that which we have had from the beginning that we love one
another

16 And this is charity That we walk according to his commandments
For this is the commandment that as you have heard from the beginning
you should walk in the same

17 For many seducers are gone out into the world who confess not that
Jesus Christ is come in the flesh This is a seducer and an antichrist

18 Look to yourselves that you lose not the things which you have
wrought but that you may receive a full reward

19 Whosoever revolteth and continueth not in the doctrine of Christ
hath not God He that continueth in the doctrine the same hath both
the Father and the Son

110 If any man come to you and bring not this doctrine receive him
not into the house nor say to him God speed you

Nor say to him God speed you  This admonition is in general to
forewarn the faithful of the dangers which may arise from a familiarity
with those who have prevaricated and gone from the true faith and with
such as teach false doctrine But this is not forbidding a charity for
all men by which we ought to wish and pray for the eternal salvation
of every one even of our enemies

111 For he that saith unto him God speed you communicateth with his
wicked works

112 Having more things to write unto you I would not by paper and
ink for I hope that I shall be with you and speak face to face that
your joy may be full

113 The children of thy sister Elect salute thee




THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST JOHN THE APOSTLE



St John praises Gaius for his walking in truth and for his charity
complains of the bad conduct of Diotrephes and gives a good testimony
to Demetrius



3 John Chapter 1


11 The Ancient to the dearly beloved Gaius whom I love in truth

12 Dearly beloved concerning all things I make it my prayer that
thou mayest proceed prosperously and fare well as thy soul doth
prosperously

13 I was exceedingly glad when the brethren came and gave testimony
to the truth in thee even as thou walkest in the truth

14 I have no greater grace than this to hear that my children walk
in truth

No greater grace  that is nothing that gives me greater joy and
satisfaction

15 Dearly beloved thou dost faithfully whatever thou dost for the
brethren and that for strangers

16 Who have given testimony to thy charity in the sight of the
church Whom thou shalt do well to bring forward on their way in a
manner worthy of God

17 Because for his name they went out taking nothing of the
Gentiles

Taking nothing of the Gentiles  These ministers of the gospel are
commended by St John who took nothing from the Gentiles lest they
should seem to preach in order to get money by it

18 We therefore ought to receive such that we may be fellow helpers
of the truth

19 I had written perhaps to the church but Diotrephes who loveth to
have the preeminence among them doth not receive us

Diotrephes who loveth  This man seemeth to be in power but not a
friend to the faithful therefore this part of the letter might be an
admonition to him from the apostle

111 Dearly beloved follow not that which is evil but that which is
good He that doth good is of God he that doth evil hath not seen God

112 To Demetrius testimony is given by all and by the truth itself
yea and we also give testimony And thou knowest that our testimony is
true

113 I had many things to write unto thee but I would not by ink and
pen write to thee

114 But I hope speedily to see thee and we will speak mouth to
mouth Peace be to thee Our friends salute thee Salute the friends
by name




THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST JUDE



St Jude who wrote this Epistle was one of the twelve Apostles and
brother to St James the Less The time it was written is uncertain
only it may be inferred from verse 17 that few or none of the Apostles
were then living except St John He inveighs against the heresies and
wicked practices of the Simonians Nicolaites and Gnostics etc
describing them and their leaders by strong epithets and similes He
exhorts the faithful to contend earnestly for the faith first delivered
to them and to beware of heretics



Jude Chapter 1


He exhorts them to stand to the faith first delivered to them and to
beware of heretics

11 Jude the servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James to them
that are beloved in God the Father and preserved in Jesus Christ and
called

12 Mercy unto you and peace and charity be fulfilled

13 Dearly beloved taking all care to write unto you concerning your
common salvation I was under a necessity to write unto you to beseech
you to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints

14 For certain men are secretly entered in who were written of long
ago unto this judgment ungodly men turning the grace of our Lord God
into riotousness and denying the only sovereign Ruler and our Lord
Jesus Christ

15 I will therefore admonish you though ye once knew all things
that Jesus having saved the people out of the land of Egypt did
afterwards destroy them that believed not

16 And the angels who kept not their principality but forsook their
own habitation he hath reserved under darkness in everlasting chains
unto the judgment of the great day

Principality  That is the state in which they were first created
their original dignity

17 As Sodom and Gomorrha and the neighbouring cities in like manner
having given themselves to fornication and going after other flesh
were made an example suffering the punishment of eternal fire

18 In like manner these men also defile the flesh and despise
dominion and blaspheme majesty

Blaspheme majesty  Speak evil of them that are in dignity and even
utter blasphemies against the divine majesty

19 When Michael the archangel disputing with the devil contended
about the body of Moses he durst not bring against him the judgment of
railing speech but said The Lord command thee

Contended about the body etc  This contention which is no where
else mentioned in holy writ was originally known by revelation and
transmitted by tradition It is thought the occasion of it was that
the devil would have had the body buried in such a place and manner as
to be worshipped by the Jews with divine honours Command thee  or
rebuke thee

110 But these men blaspheme whatever things they know not and what
things soever they naturally know like dumb beasts in these they are
corrupted

111 Woe unto them For they have gone in the way of Cain and after
the error of Balaam they have for reward poured out themselves and have
perished in the contradiction of Core

Gone in the way etc  Heretics follow the way of Cain by murdering
the souls of their brethren the way of Balaam by putting a scandal
before the people of God for their own private ends and the way of
Core or Korah by their opposition to the church governors of divine
appointment

112 These are spots in their banquets feasting together without
fear feeding themselves clouds without water which are carried about
by winds trees of the autumn unfruitful twice dead plucked up by
the roots

113 Raging waves of the sea foaming out their own confusion
wandering stars to whom the storm of darkness is reserved for ever

114 Now of these Enoch also the seventh from Adam prophesied
saying Behold the Lord cometh with thousands of his saints

Prophesied  This prophecy was either known by tradition or from some
book that is since lost

115 To execute judgment upon all and to reprove all the ungodly for
all the works of their ungodliness whereby they have done ungodly and
for all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against God

116 These are murmurers full of complaints walking according to
their own desires and their mouth speaketh proud things admiring
persons for gains sake

117 But you my dearly beloved be mindful of the words which have
been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ

But you my dearly beloved be mindful etc  He now exhorts the
faithful to remain steadfast in the belief and practice of what they
had heard from the apostles who had also foretold that in aftertimes
lit in the last time there should be false teachers scoffing and
ridiculing all revealed truths abandoning themselves to their passions
and lusts who separate themselves from the Catholic communion by
heresies and schisms Sensual men  carried away and enslaved by the
pleasures of the senses

118 Who told you that in the last time there should come mockers
walking according to their own desires in ungodlinesses

119 These are they who separate themselves sensual men having not
the Spirit

120 But you my beloved building yourselves upon your most holy
faith praying in the Holy Ghost

121 Keep yourselves in the love of God waiting for the mercy of our
Lord Jesus Christ unto life everlasting

Building yourselves upon your most holy faith  Raising by your
actions a spiritual building founded 1st upon faith 2d on the
love of God 3d upon hope whilst you are waiting for the mercies of
God and the reward of eternal life 4th joined with the great duty of
prayer

122 And some indeed reprove being judged

123 But others save pulling them out of the fire And on others have
mercy in fear hating also the spotted garment which is carnal

And some indeed reprove being judged  He gives them another
instruction to practice charity in endeavouring to convert their
neighbour where they will meet with three sorts of persons 1st With
persons obstinate in their errors and sins these may be said to be
already judged and condemned they are to be sharply reprehended
reproved and if possible convinced of their error 2d As to others
you must endeavour to save them by pulling them as it were out of
the fire from the ruin they stand in great danger of 3d You must
have mercy on others in fear when you see them through ignorance of
frailty in danger of being drawn into the snares of these heretics
with these you must deal more gently and mildly with a charitable
compassion hating always and teaching others to hate the carnal
garment which is spotted their sensual and corrupt manners that
defile both the soul and body

124 Now to him who is able to preserve you without sin and to present
you spotless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy in
the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ

125 To the only God our Saviour through Jesus Christ our Lord be
glory and magnificence empire and power before all ages and now and
for all ages of ages Amen

Now to him etc  St Jude concludes his epistle with this doxology of
praising God and praying to the only God our Saviour which may either
signify God the Father or God as equally agreeing to all the three
persons who are equally the cause of Christs incarnation and mans
salvation through Jesus Christ our Lord who being God from eternity
took upon him our human nature that he might become our Redeemer




THE APOCALYPSE OF ST JOHN THE APOSTLE



In the first second and third chapters of this Book are contained
instructions and admonitions which St John was commanded to write to
the seven bishops of the churches in Asia And in the following
chapters to the end are contained prophecies of things that are to
come to pass in the Church of Christ particularly towards the end of
the world in the time of Antichrist It was written in Greek in the
island of Patmos where St John was in banishment by order of the
cruel emperor Domitian about sixtyfour years after our Lords
Ascension



Apocalypse Chapter 1


St John is ordered to write to the seven churches in Asia The manner
of Christs appearing to him

11 The Revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to make
known to his servants the things which must shortly come to pass and
signified sending by his angel to his servant John

The things which must shortly come  and again it is said ver 3
The time is at hand  This can not be meant of all the things
prophesied in the Apocalypse where mention is made also of the day of
judgment and of the glory of heaven at the end of the world That some
things were to come to pass shortly is evident by what is said to the
Seven Churches chap 2 and 3 Or that the persecutions foretold should
begin shortly Or that these words signified that all time is short
and that from the coming of Christ we are now in the last age or last
hour See 1 John 218

12 Who hath given testimony to the word of God and the testimony of
Jesus Christ what things soever he hath seen

13 Blessed is he that readeth and heareth the words of this prophecy
and keepeth those things which are written in it For the time is at
hand

14 John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you
and peace from him that is and that was and that is to come and from
the seven spirits which are before his throne

15 And from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness the first
begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth who hath
loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood

16 And hath made us a kingdom and priests to God and his Father To
him be glory and empire for ever and ever Amen

17 Behold he cometh with the clouds and every eye shall see him
and they also that pierced him And all the tribes of the earth shall
bewail themselves because of him Even so Amen

18 I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end saith the Lord
God who is and who was and who is to come the Almighty

I am Alpha and Omega  These are the names of the first and last
letters of the Greek alphabet and signify the same as what follows
The beginning and the end the first cause and last end of all beings
who is and who was and who is to come the Almighty  These words
signify the true God only and are here applied to our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ who is to come again to judge the living and the dead

19 I John your brother and your partner in tribulation and in the
kingdom and patience in Christ Jesus was in the island which is called
Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus

110 I was in the spirit on the Lords day and heard behind me a great
voice as of a trumpet

111 Saying What thou seest write in a book and send to the seven
churches which are in Asia to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamus
and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea

112 And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me And being
turned I saw seven golden candlesticks

113 And in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like to
the Son of man clothed with a garment down to the feet and girt about
the paps with a golden girdle

114 And his head and his hairs were white as white wool and as snow
And his eyes were as a flame of fire

115 And his feet like unto fine brass as in a burning furnace And
his voice as the sound of many waters

116 And he had in his right hand seven stars And from his mouth came
out a sharp twoedged sword And his face was as the sun shineth in his
power

117 And when I had seen him I fell at his feet as dead And he laid
his right hand upon me saying Fear not I am the First and the Last

118 And alive and was dead And behold I am living for ever and ever
and have the keys of death and of hell

119 Write therefore the things which thou hast seen and which are
and which must be done hereafter

120 The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right
hand and the seven golden candlesticks The seven stars are the angels
of the seven churches And the seven candlesticks are the seven
churches



Apocalypse Chapter 2


Directions what to write to the angels or bishops of Ephesus Smyrna
Pergamus and Thyatira

21 Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write These things saith
he who holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the
midst of the seven golden candlesticks

22 I know thy works and thy labour and thy patience and how thou
canst not bear them that are evil And thou hast tried them who say
they are apostles and are not and hast found them liars

23 And thou hast patience and hast endured for my name and hast not
fainted

24 But I have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first
charity

25 Be mindful therefore from whence thou art fallen and do penance
and do the first works Or else I come to thee and will move thy
candlestick out of its place except thou do penance

26 But this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaites
which I also hate

27 He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith to the
churches To him that overcometh I will give to eat of the tree of life
which is in the paradise of my God

28 And to the angel of the church of Smyrna write These things saith
the First and the Last who was dead and is alive

29 I know thy tribulation and thy poverty but thou art rich And
thou art blasphemed by them that say they are Jews and are not but are
the synagogue of Satan

210 Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer Behold the
devil will cast some of you into prison that you may be tried and you
shall have tribulation ten days Be thou faithful unto death and I
will give thee the crown of life

211 He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith to the
churches He that shall overcome shall not be hurt by the second death

212 And to the angel of the church of Pergamus write These things
saith he that hath the sharp twoedged sword

213 I know where thou dwellest where the seat of Satan is And thou
holdest fast my name and hast not denied my faith Even in those days
when Antipas was my faithful witness who was slain among you where
Satan dwelleth

214 But I have against thee a few things because thou hast there
them that hold the doctrine of Balaam who taught Balac to cast a
stumblingblock before the children of Israel to eat and to commit
fornication

215 So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaites

216 In like manner do penance If not I will come to thee quickly
and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth

217 He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith to the
churches To him that overcometh I will give the hidden manna and will
give him a white counter and in the counter a new name written which
no man knoweth but he that receiveth it

218 And to the angel of the church of Thyatira write These things
saith the Son of God who hath his eyes like to a flame of fire and his
feet like to fine brass

219 I know thy works and thy faith and thy charity and thy ministry
and thy patience and thy last works which are more than the former

220 But I have against thee a few things because thou sufferest the
woman Jezabel who calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce
my servants to commit fornication and to eat of things sacrificed to
idols

221 And I gave her a time that she might do penance and she will not
repent of her fornication

222 Behold I will cast her into a bed and they that commit adultery
with her shall be in very great tribulation except they do penance
from their deeds

223 And I will kill her children with death and all the churches
shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and hearts And I will
give to every one of you according to your works But to you I say

224 And to the rest who are at Thyatira Whosoever have not this
doctrine and who have not known the depths of Satan as they say I
will not put upon you any other burthen

225 Yet that which you have hold fast till I come

226 And he that shall overcome and keep my words unto the end I will
give him power over the nations

Power over the nations  This shews that the saints who are with
Christ our Lord in heaven receive power from him to preside over
nations and provinces as patrons and shall come with him at the end
of the world to execute his will against those who have not kept his
commandments

227 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron and as the vessel of a
potter they shall be broken

228 As I also have received of my Father And I will give him the
morning star

229 He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith to the
churches



Apocalypse Chapter 3


Directions what to write to Sardis Philadelphia and Laodicea

31 And to the angel of the church of Sardis write These things saith
he that hath the seven spirits of God and the seven stars I know thy
works and that thou hast the name of being alive And thou art dead

32 Be watchful and strengthen the things that remain which are ready
to die For I find not thy works full before my God

33 Have in mind therefore in what manner thou hast received and
heard and observe and do penance If then thou shalt not watch I will
come to thee as a thief and thou shalt not know at what hour I will
come to thee

34 But thou hast a few names in Sardis which have not defiled their
garments and they shall walk with me in white because they are
worthy

35 He that shall overcome shall thus be clothed in white garments
and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life And I will
confess his name before my Father and before his angels

36 He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith to the
churches

37 And to the angel of the church of Philadelphia write These things
saith the Holy One and the true one he that hath the key of David he
that openeth and no man shutteth shutteth and no man openeth

38 I know thy works Behold I have given before thee a door opened
which no man can shut because thou hast a little strength and hast
kept my word and hast not denied my name

39 Behold I will bring of the synagogue of Satan who say they are
Jews and are not but do lie Behold I will make them to come and
adore before thy feet And they shall know that I have loved thee

310 Because thou hast kept the word of my patience I will also keep
thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon the whole world
to try them that dwell upon the earth

311 Behold I come quickly hold fast that which thou hast that no
man take thy crown

312 He that shall overcome I will make him a pillar in the temple of
my God and he shall go out no more And I will write upon him the name
of my God and the name of the city of my God the new Jerusalem which
cometh down out of heaven from my God and my new name

313 He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith to the
churches

314 And to the angel of the church of Laodicea write These things
saith the Amen the faithful and true witness who is the beginning of
the creation of God

The Amen  that is the true one the Truth itself the Word and Son
of God The beginning  that is the principle the source and the
efficient cause of the whole creation

315 I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would
thou wert cold or hot

316 But because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
begin to vomit thee out of my mouth

317 Because thou sayest I am rich and made wealthy and have need of
nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor
and blind and naked

318 I counsel thee to buy of me gold fire tried that thou mayest be
made rich and mayest be clothed in white garments and that the shame
of thy nakedness may not appear And anoint thy eyes with eyesalve
that thou mayest see

319 Such as I love I rebuke and chastise Be zealous therefore and
do penance

320 Behold I stand at the gate and knock If any man shall hear my
voice and open to me the door I will come in to him and will sup with
him and he with me

321 To him that shall overcome I will give to sit with me in my
throne as I also have overcome and am set down with my Father in his
throne

322 He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith to the
churches



Apocalypse Chapter 4


The vision of the throne of God the twentyfour ancients and the four
living creatures

41 After these things I looked and behold a door was opened in
heaven and the first voice which I heard as it were of a trumpet
speaking with me said Come up hither and I will shew thee the things
which must be done hereafter

42 And immediately I was in the spirit And behold there was a
throne set in heaven and upon the throne one sitting

43 And he that sat was to the sight like the jasper and the sardine
stone And there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like
unto an emerald

44 And round about the throne were four and twenty seats and upon
the seats four and twenty ancients sitting clothed in white garments
And on their heads were crowns of gold

45 And from the throne proceeded lightnings and voices and thunders
And there were seven lamps burning before the throne which are the
seven Spirits of God

46 And in the sight of the throne was as it were a sea of glass
like to crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about the
throne were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind

47 And the first living creature was like a lion and the second
living creature like a calf and the third living creature having the
face as it were of a man and the fourth living creature was like an
eagle flying

48 And the four living creatures had each of them six wings and
round about and within they are full of eyes And they rested not day
and night saying Holy Holy Holy Lord God Almighty who was and who
is and who is to come

49 And when those living creatures gave glory and honour and
benediction to him that sitteth on the throne who liveth for ever and
ever

410 The four and twenty ancients fell down before him that sitteth on
the throne and adored him that liveth for ever and ever and cast their
crowns before the throne saying

411 Thou art worthy O Lord our God to receive glory and honour and
power Because thou hast created all things and for thy will they were
and have been created



Apocalypse Chapter 5


The book sealed with seven seals is opened by the Lamb who thereupon
receives adoration and praise from all

51 And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a
book written within and without sealed with seven seals

52 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice Who is
worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof

53 And no man was able neither in heaven nor on earth nor under the
earth to open the book nor to look on it

54 And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open the book
nor to see it

55 And one of the ancients said to me Weep not behold the lion of
the tribe of Juda the root of David hath prevailed to open the book
and to loose the seven seals thereof

56 And I saw and behold in the midst of the throne and of the four
living creatures and in the midst of the ancients a Lamb standing as
it were slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven
Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth

57 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that
sat on the throne

58 And when he had opened the book the four living creatures and the
four and twenty ancients fell down before the Lamb having every one of
them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of
saints

The prayers of saints  Here we see that the saints in heaven offer up
to Christ the prayers of the faithful upon earth

59 And they sung a new canticle saying Thou art worthy O Lord to
take the book and to open the seals thereof because thou wast slain
and hast redeemed us to God in thy blood out of every tribe and
tongue and people and nation

510 And hast made us to our God a kingdom and priests and we shall
reign on the earth

511 And I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about
the throne and the living creatures and the ancients and the number of
them was thousands of thousands

512 Saying with a loud voice The Lamb that was slain is worthy to
receive power and divinity and wisdom and strength and honour and glory
and benediction

513 And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under
the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them I
heard all saying To him that sitteth on the throne and to the Lamb
benediction and honour and glory and power for ever and ever

514 And the four living creatures said Amen And the four and twenty
ancients fell down on their faces and adored him that liveth for ever
and ever



Apocalypse Chapter 6


What followed upon opening six of the seals

61 And I saw that the Lamb had opened one of the seven seals and I
heard one of the four living creatures as it were the voice of
thunder saying Come and see

62 And I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a
bow and there was a crown given him and he went forth conquering that
he might conquer

White horse  He that sitteth on the white horse is Christ going
forth to subdue the world by his gospel The other horses that follow
represent the judgments and punishment that were to fall on the enemies
of Christ and his church The red horse signifies war the black horse
famine and the pale horse which has Death for its rider plagues or
pestilence

63 And when he had opened the second seal I heard the second living
creature saying Come and see

64 And there went out another horse that was red And to him that sat
thereon it was given that he should take peace from the earth and
that they should kill one another And a great sword was given to him

65 And when he had opened the third seal I heard the third living
creature saying Come and see And behold a black horse And he that
sat on him had a pair of scales in his hand

66 And I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living
creatures saying Two pounds of wheat for a penny and thrice two
pounds of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the wine and the
oil

67 And when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the
fourth living creature saying Come and see

68 And behold a pale horse and he that sat upon him his name was
Death And hell followed him And power was given to him over the four
parts of the earth to kill with sword with famine and with death and
with the beasts of the earth

69 And when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar the
souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony
which they held

Under the altar  Christ as man is this altar under which the souls
of the martyrs live in heaven as their bodies are here deposited under
our altars

610 And they cried with a loud voice saying How long O Lord Holy
and True dost thou not judge and revenge our blood on them that dwell
on the earth

Revenge our blood  They ask not this out of hatred to their enemies
but out of zeal for the glory of God and a desire that the Lord would
accelerate the general judgment and the complete beatitude of all his
elect

611 And white robes were given to every one of them one And it was
said to them that they should rest for a little time till their fellow
servants and their brethren who are to be slain even as they should
be filled up

612 And I saw when he had opened the sixth seal and behold there
was a great earthquake And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair
and the whole moon became as blood

613 And the stars from heaven fell upon the earth as the fig tree
casteth its green figs when it is shaken by a great wind

614 And the heaven departed as a book folded up And every mountain
and the islands were moved out of their places

615 And the kings of the earth and the princes and tribunes and the
rich and the strong and every bondman and every freeman hid themselves
in the dens and in the rocks of mountains

616 And they say to the mountains and the rocks Fall upon us and
hide us from the face of him that sitteth upon the throne and from the
wrath of the Lamb

617 For the great day of their wrath is come And who shall be able
to stand



Apocalypse Chapter 7


The number of them that were marked with the seal of the living God and
clothed in white robes

71 After these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners
of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that they should not
blow upon the earth nor upon the sea nor on any tree

72 And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun
having the sign of the living God And he cried with a loud voice to
the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea

73 Saying Hurt not the earth nor the sea nor the trees till we sign
the servants of our God in their foreheads

74 And I heard the number of them that were signed An hundred
fortyfour thousand were signed of every tribe of the children of
Israel

75 Of the tribe of Juda twelve thousand signed Of the tribe of
Ruben twelve thousand signed Of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand
signed

76 Of the tribe of Aser twelve thousand signed Of the tribe of
Nephthali twelve thousand signed Of the tribe of Manasses twelve
thousand signed

77 Of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand signed Of the tribe of
Levi twelve thousand signed Of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand
signed

78 Of the tribe of Zabulon twelve thousand signed Of the tribe of
Joseph twelve thousand signed Of the tribe of Benjamin twelve
thousand signed

79 After this I saw a great multitude which no man could number of
all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues standing before the
throne and in sight of the Lamb clothed with white robes and palms in
their hands

710 And they cried with a loud voice saying Salvation to our God
who sitteth upon the throne and to the Lamb

711 And all the angels stood round about the throne and the ancients
and the four living creatures And they fell down before the throne
upon their faces and adored God

712 Saying Amen Benediction and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving
honour and power and strength to our God for ever and ever Amen

713 And one of the ancients answered and said to me These that are
clothed in white robes who are they And whence came they

714 And I said to him My Lord thou knowest And he said to me
These are they who are come out of great tribulation and have washed
their robes and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb

715 Therefore they are before the throne of God and they serve him
day and night in his temple And he that sitteth on the throne shall
dwell over them

716 They shall no more hunger nor thirst neither shall the sun fall
on them nor any heat

717 For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall rule
them and shall lead them to the fountains of the waters of life and
God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes



Apocalypse Chapter 8


The seventh seal is opened The angels with the seven trumpets

81 And when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in
heaven as it were for half an hour

82 And I saw seven angels standing in the presence of God and there
were given to them seven trumpets

83 And another angel came and stood before the altar having a golden
censer and there was given to him much incense that he should offer
of the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which is before the
throne of God

84 And the smoke of the incense of the prayers of the saints ascended
up before God from the hand of the angel

85 And the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the
altar and cast it on the earth and there were thunders and voices and
lightnings and a great earthquake

86 And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared
themselves to sound the trumpet

87 And the first angel sounded the trumpet and there followed hail
and fire mingled with blood and it was cast on the earth And the
third part of the earth was burnt up and the third part of the trees
was burnt up and all green grass was burnt up

88 And the second angel sounded the trumpet and as it were a great
mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea And the third part
of the sea became blood

89 And the third part of those creatures died which had life in the
sea and the third part of the ships was destroyed

810 And the third angel sounded the trumpet and a great star fell
from heaven burning as it were a torch And it fell on the third part
of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters

811 And the name of the star is called Wormwood And the third part
of the waters became wormwood And many men died of the waters because
they were made bitter

812 And the fourth angel sounded the trumpet and the third part of
the sun was smitten and the third part of the moon and the third part
of the stars so that the third part of them was darkened And the day
did not shine for a third part of it and the night in like manner

813 And I beheld and heard the voice of one eagle flying through the
midst of heaven saying with a loud voice Woe Woe Woe to the
inhabitants of the earth by reason of the rest of the voices of the
three angels who are yet to sound the trumpet



Apocalypse Chapter 9


Locusts come forth from the bottomless pit The vision of the army of
horsemen

91 And the fifth angel sounded the trumpet and I saw a star fall
from heaven upon the earth And there was given to him the key of the
bottomless pit

A star full  This may mean the fall and apostasy of great and learned
men from the true faith Or a whole nation falling into error and
separating from the church not having the sign of God in their
foreheads And there was given to him the key of the bottomless
pit  That is to the angel not to the fallen star To this angel was
given the power which is here signified by a key of opening hell

92 And he opened the bottomless pit and the smoke of the pit arose
as the smoke of a great furnace And the sun and the air were darkened
with the smoke of the pit

93 And from the smoke of the pit there came out locusts upon the
earth And power was given to them as the scorpions of the earth have
power

There came out locusts  These may be devils in Antichrists time
having the appearance of locusts but large and monstrous as here
described Or they may be real locusts but of an extraordinary size
and monstrous shape such as were never before seen on earth sent to
torment those who have not the sign or seal of God on their
foreheads Some commentators by these locusts understand heretics and
especially those heretics that sprung from Jews and with them denied
the divinity of Jesus Christ as Theodotus Praxeas Noetus Paul of
Samosata Sabellius Arius etc These were great enemies of the
Christian religion they tormented and infected the souls of men
stinging them like scorpions with the poison of their heresies Others
have explained these locusts and other animals mentioned in different
places throughout this sacred and mystical book in a most absurd
fanciful and ridiculous manner they make Abaddon the Pope and the
locusts to be friars mendicant etc Here it is thought proper not to
enter into any controversy upon that subject as the inventors of these
fancies have been already answered and fully refuted by many
controvertists besides those who might be inposed on by such
chimerical writers are in these days much better informed

94 And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of
the earth nor any green thing nor any tree but only the men who have
not the sign of God on their foreheads

95 And it was given unto them that they should not kill them but
that they should torment them five months And their torment was as the
torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man

96 And in those days men shall seek death and shall not find it And
they shall desire to die and death shall fly from them

97 And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto
battle And on their heads were as it were crowns like gold and
their faces were as the faces of men

98 And they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were as
lions

99 And they had breastplates as breastplates of iron and the noise
of their wings was as the noise of chariots and many horses running to
battle

910 And they had tails like to scorpions and there were stings in
their tails And their power was to hurt men five months And they had
over them

911 A king the angel of the bottomless pit whose name in Hebrew is
Abaddon and in Greek Apollyon in Latin Exterminans

912 One woe is past and behold there come yet two woes more
hereafter

913 And the sixth angel sounded the trumpet and I heard a voice from
the four horns of the golden altar which is before the eyes of God

914 Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet Loose the four
angels who are bound in the great river Euphrates

915 And the four angels were loosed who were prepared for an hour
and a day and a month and a year for to kill the third part of men

916 And the number of the army of horsemen was twenty thousand times
ten thousand And I heard the number of them

917 And thus I saw the horses in the vision And they that sat on
them had breastplates of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone And the
heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and from their mouths
proceeded fire and smoke and brimstone

918 And by these three plagues was slain the third part of men by
the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of
their mouths

919 For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their
tails For their tails are like to serpents and have heads and with
them they hurt

920 And the rest of the men who were not slain by these plagues did
not do penance from the works of their hands that they should not
adore devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood
which neither can see nor hear nor walk

921 Neither did they penance from their murders nor from their
sorceries nor from their fornication nor from their thefts



Apocalypse Chapter 10


The cry of a mighty angel He gives John a book to eat

101 And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed
with a cloud And a rainbow was on his head and his face as the sun
and his feet as pillars of fire

102 And he had in his hand a little book open And he set his right
foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth

103 And he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth And when
he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices

104 And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices I was about
to write And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me Seal up the
things which the seven thunders have spoken And write them not

105 And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth
lifted up his hand to heaven

106 And he swore by him that liveth for ever and ever who created
heaven and the things which are therein and the earth and the things
which are in it and the sea and the things which are therein That
time shall be no longer

107 But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall
begin to sound the trumpet the mystery of God shall be finished as he
hath declared by his servants the prophets

Declared  literally evangelized to signify the good tidings
agreeable to the Gospel of the final victory of Christ and of that
eternal life which should be the reward of the temporal sufferings of
the martyrs and faithful servants of God

108 And I heard a voice from heaven again speaking to me and saying
Go and take the book that is open from the hand of the angel who
standeth upon the sea and upon the earth

109 And I went to the angel saying unto him that he should give me
the book And he said to me Take the book and eat it up And it shall
make thy belly bitter but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey

1010 And I took the book from the hand of the angel and ate it up
and it was in my mouth sweet as honey And when I had eaten it my
belly was bitter

1011 And he said to me Thou must prophesy again to many nations and
peoples and tongues and kings



Apocalypse Chapter 11


He is ordered to measure the temple The two witnesses

111 And there was given me a reed like unto a rod And it was said
to me Arise and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that
adore therein

112 But the court which is without the temple cast out and measure
it not because it is given unto the Gentiles And the holy city they
shall tread under foot two and forty months

113 And I will give unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a
thousand two hundred sixty days clothed in sackcloth

My two witnesses  It is commonly understood of Henoch and Elias

114 These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks that stand
before the Lord of the earth

115 And if any man will hurt them fire shall come out of their
mouths and shall devour their enemies And if any man will hurt them
in this manner must he be slain

116 These have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of
their prophecy And they have power over waters to turn them into
blood and to strike the earth with all plagues as often as they will

117 And when they shall have finished their testimony the beast that
ascendeth out of the abyss shall make war against them and shall
overcome them and kill them

118 And their bodies shall lie in the streets of the great city which
is called spiritually Sodom and Egypt where their Lord also was
crucified

119 And they of the tribes and peoples and tongues and nations shall
see their bodies for three days and a half and they shall not suffer
their bodies to be laid in sepulchres

1110 And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and
make merry and shall send gifts one to another because these two
prophets tormented them that dwelt upon the earth

1111 And after three days and a half the spirit of life from God
entered into them And they stood upon their feet and great fear fell
upon them that saw them

1112 And they heard a great voice from heaven saying to them Come
up hither And they went up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies saw
them

1113 And at that hour there was made a great earthquake and the
tenth part of the city fell And there were slain in the earthquake
names of men seven thousand and the rest were cast into a fear and
gave glory to the God of heaven

1114 The second woe is past and behold the third woe will come
quickly

1115 And the seventh angel sounded the trumpet and there were great
voices in heaven saying The kingdom of this world is become our
Lords and his Christs and he shall reign for ever and ever Amen

1116 And the four and twenty ancients who sit on their seats in the
sight of God fell on their faces and adored God saying

1117 We give thee thanks O Lord God Almighty who art and who wast
and who art to come because thou hast taken to thee thy great power
and thou hast reigned

1118 And the nations were angry and thy wrath is come And the time
of the dead that they should be judged and that thou shouldest render
reward to thy servants the prophets and the saints and to them that
fear thy name little and great and shouldest destroy them who have
corrupted the earth

1119 And the temple of God was opened in heaven and the ark of his
testament was seen in his temple And there were lightnings and voices
and an earthquake and great hail



Apocalypse Chapter 12


The vision of the woman clothed with the sun and of the great dragon
her persecutor

121 And a great sign appeared in heaven A woman clothed with the
sun and the moon under her feet and on her head a crown of twelve
stars

A woman  The church of God It may also by allusion be applied to
our blessed Lady The church is clothed with the sun that is with
Christ she hath the moon that is the changeable things of the world
under her feet and the twelve stars with which she is crowned are the
twelve apostles she is in labour and pain whilst she brings forth her
children and Christ in them in the midst of afflictions and
persecutions

122 And being with child she cried travailing in birth and was in
pain to be delivered

123 And there was seen another sign in heaven And behold a great red
dragon having seven heads and ten horns and on his heads seven
diadems

124 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and cast
them to the earth And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready
to be delivered that when she should be delivered he might devour
her son

125 And she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations
with an iron rod And her son was taken up to God and to his throne

126 And the woman fled into the wilderness where she had a place
prepared by God that there they should feed her a thousand two
hundred sixty days

127 And there was a great battle in heaven Michael and his angels
fought with the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels

128 And they prevailed not neither was their place found any more in
heaven

129 And that great dragon was cast out that old serpent who is
called the devil and Satan who seduceth the whole world And he was
cast unto the earth and his angels were thrown down with him

1210 And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying Now is come
salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of his
Christ because the accuser of our brethren is cast forth who accused
them before our God day and night

1211 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word
of the testimony and they loved not their lives unto death

1212 Therefore rejoice O heavens and you that dwell therein Woe
to the earth and to the sea because the devil is come down unto you
having great wrath knowing that he hath but a short time

1213 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth he
persecuted the woman who brought forth the man child

1214 And there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle
that she might fly into the desert unto her place where she is
nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the
serpent

1215 And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water
as it were a river that he might cause her to be carried away by the
river

1216 And the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth
and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth

1217 And the dragon was angry against the woman and went to make war
with the rest of her seed who keep the commandments of God and have
the testimony of Jesus Christ

1218 And he stood upon the sand of the sea



Apocalypse Chapter 13


Of the beast with seven heads and of a second beast

131 And I saw a beast coming up out the sea having seven heads and
ten horns and upon his horns ten diadems and upon his heads names
of blasphemy

A beast  This first beast with seven heads and ten horns is probably
the whole company of infidels enemies and persecutors of the people of
God from the beginning to the end of the world The seven heads are
seven kings that is seven principal kingdoms or empires which have
exercised or shall exercise tyrannical power over the people of God
of these five were then fallen viz the Egyptian Assyrian
Chaldean Persian and Grecian monarchies one was present viz the
empire of Rome and the seventh and chiefest was to come viz the
great Antichrist and his empire The ten horns may be understood of ten
lesser persecutors

132 And the beast which I saw was like to a leopard and his feet
were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion And
the dragon gave him his own strength and great power

133 And I saw one of his heads as it were slain to death and his
deaths wound was healed And all the earth was in admiration after the
beast

One of his heads etc  Some understand this of the mortal wound
which the idolatry of the Roman empire signified by the sixth head
received from Constantine which was as it were healed again by
Julian the Apostate

134 And they adored the dragon which gave power to the beast And
they adored the beast saying Who is like to the beast And who shall
be able to fight with him

135 And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and
blasphemies and power was given to him to do two and forty months

136 And he opened his mouth unto blasphemies against God to
blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven

His tabernacle etc  That is his church and his saints

137 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to
overcome them And power was given him over every tribe and people and
tongue and nation

138 And all that dwell upon the earth adored him whose names are not
written in the book of life of the Lamb which was slain from the
beginning of the world

Slain from the beginning etc  In the foreknowledge of God and
inasmuch as all mercy and grace from the beginning was given in view
of his death and passion

139 If any man have an ear let him hear

1310 He that shall lead into captivity shall go into captivity he
that shall kill by the sword must be killed by the sword Here is the
patience and the faith of the saints

1311 And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth and he had
two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon

Another beast  This second beast with two horns may be understood of
the heathenish priests and magicians the principal promoters both of
idolatry and persecution

1312 And he executed all the power of the former beast in his sight
And he caused the earth and them that dwell therein to adore the first
beast whose wound to death was healed

1313 And he did great signs so that he made also fire to come down
from heaven unto the earth in the sight of men

1314 And he seduced them that dwell on the earth for the signs which
were given him to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that
dwell on the earth that they should make the image of the beast which
had the wound by the sword and lived

1315 And it was given him to give life to the image of the beast and
that the image of the beast should speak and should cause that
whosoever will not adore the image of the beast should be slain

1316 And he shall make all both little and great rich and poor
freemen and bondmen to have a character in their right hand or on
their foreheads

1317 And that no man might buy or sell but he that hath the
character or the name of the beast or the number of his name

1318 Here is wisdom He that hath understanding let him count the
number of the beast For it is the number of a man and the number of
him is six hundred sixtysix

Six hundred sixtysix  The numeral letters of his name shall make up
this number



Apocalypse Chapter 14


Of the Lamb and of the virgins that follow him Of the judgments that
shall fall upon the wicked

141 And I beheld and lo a Lamb stood upon mount Sion and with him
an hundred fortyfour thousand having his name and the name of his
Father written on their foreheads

142 And I heard a voice from heaven as the noise of many waters and
as the voice of great thunder And the voice which I heard was as the
voice of harpers harping on their harps

143 And they sung as it were a new canticle before the throne and
before the four living creatures and the ancients and no man could say
the canticle but those hundred fortyfour thousand who were purchased
from the earth

144 These are they who were not defiled with women for they are
virgins These follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth These were
purchased from among men the firstfruits to God and to the Lamb

145 And in their mouth there was found no lie for they are without
spot before the throne of God

146 And I saw another angel flying through the midst of heaven
having the eternal gospel to preach unto them that sit upon the earth
and over every nation and tribe and tongue and people

147 Saying with a loud voice Fear the Lord and give him honour
because the hour of his judgment is come And adore ye him that made
heaven and earth the sea and the fountains of waters

148 And another angel followed saying That great Babylon is fallen
is fallen which made all nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of
her fornication

Babylon  By Babylon may be very probably signified all the wicked
world in general which God will punish and destroy after the short
time of this mortal life or it may signify every great city wherein
enormous sins and abominations are daily committed and that when the
measure of its iniquities is full the punishments due to its crimes
are poured on it It may also be some city of the description in the
text that will exist and be destroyed as here described towards the
end of the world

149 And the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice If
any man shall adore the beast and his image and receive his character
in his forehead or in his hand

1410 He also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is
mingled with pure wine in the cup of his wrath and shall be tormented
with fire and brimstone in the sight of the holy angels and in the
sight of the Lamb

1411 And the smoke of their torments shall ascend up for ever and
ever neither have they rest day nor night who have adored the beast
and his image and whoever receiveth the character of his name

1412 Here is the patience of the saints who keep the commandments of
God and the faith of Jesus

1413 And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me Write Blessed
are the dead who die in the Lord From henceforth now saith the
Spirit that they may rest from their labours For their works follow
them

Die in the Lord  It is understood of the martyrs who die for the
Lord

1414 And I saw and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud one
sitting like to the Son of man having on his head a crown of gold and
in his hand a sharp sickle

1415 And another angel came out from the temple crying with a loud
voice to him that sat upon the cloud Thrust in thy sickle and reap
because the hour is come to reap For the harvest of the earth is ripe

1416 And he that sat on the cloud thrust his sickle into the earth
and the earth was reaped

1417 And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven he
also having a sharp sickle

1418 And another angel came out from the altar who had power over
fire And he cried with a loud voice to him that had the sharp sickle
saying Thrust in thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the
vineyard of the earth because the grapes thereof are ripe

1419 And the angel thrust in his sharp sickle into the earth and
gathered the vineyard of the earth and cast it into the great press of
the wrath of God

1420 And the press was trodden without the city and blood came out
of the press up to the horses bridles for a thousand and six hundred
furlongs



Apocalypse Chapter 15


They that have overcome the beast glorify God Of the seven angels with
the seven vials

151 And I saw another sign in heaven great and wonderful seven
angels having the seven last plagues For in them is filled up the
wrath of God

152 And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them
that had overcome the beast and his image and the number of his name
standing on the sea of glass having the harps of God

153 And singing the canticle of Moses the servant of God and the
canticle of the Lamb saying Great and wonderful are thy works O Lord
God Almighty Just and true are thy ways O King of ages

154 Who shall not fear thee O Lord and magnify thy name For thou
only art holy For all nations shall come and shall adore in thy sight
because thy judgments are manifest

155 And after these things I looked and behold the temple of the
tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened

156 And the seven angels came out of the temple having the seven
plagues clothed with clean and white linen and girt about the breasts
with golden girdles

157 And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels
seven golden vials full of the wrath of God who liveth for ever and
ever

158 And the temple was filled with smoke from the majesty of God and
from his power And no man was able to enter into the temple till the
seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled



Apocalypse Chapter 16


The seven vials are poured out The plagues that ensue

161 And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven
angels Go and pour out the seven vials of the wrath of God upon the
earth

162 And the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth And
there fell a sore and grievous wound upon men who had the character of
the beast and upon them that adored the image thereof

163 And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea And there
came blood as it were of a dead man and every living soul died in the
sea

164 And the third poured out his vial upon the rivers and the
fountains of waters And there was made blood

165 And I heard the angel of the waters saying Thou art just O
Lord who art and who wast the Holy One because thou hast judged
these things

166 For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets and thou
hast given them blood to drink For they are worthy

167 And I heard another from the altar saying Yea O Lord God
Almighty true and just are thy judgments

168 And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun And it was
given unto him to afflict men with heat and fire

169 And men were scorched with great heat and they blasphemed the
name of God who hath power over these plagues Neither did they
penance to give him glory

1610 And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the
beast And his kingdom became dark and they gnawed their tongues for
pain

1611 And they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains
and wounds and did not penance for their works

1612 And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon that great river
Euphrates and dried up the water thereof that a way might be prepared
for the kings from the rising of the sun

1613 And I saw from the mouth of the dragon and from the mouth of the
beast and from the mouth of the false prophet three unclean spirits
like frogs

1614 For they are the spirits of devils working signs and they go
forth unto the kings of the whole earth to gather them to battle
against the great day of the Almighty God

1615 Behold I come as a thief Blessed is he that watcheth and
keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame

1616 And he shall gather them together into a place which in Hebrew
is called Armagedon

Armagedon  That is the hill of robbers

1617 And the seventh angel poured out his vial upon the air And
there came a great voice out of the temple from the throne saying It
is done

1618 And there were lightnings and voices and thunders and there was
a great earthquake such an one as never had been since men were upon
the earth such an earthquake so great

1619 And the great city was divided into three parts and the cities
of the Gentiles fell And great Babylon came in remembrance before God
to give her the cup of the wine of the indignation of his wrath

1620 And every island fled away and the mountains were not found

1621 And great hail like a talent came down from heaven upon men
and men blasphemed God for the plague of the hail because it was
exceeding great



Apocalypse Chapter 17


The description of the great harlot and of the beast upon which she
sits

171 And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven vials
and spoke with me saying Come I will shew thee the condemnation of
the great harlot who sitteth upon many waters

172 With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication And
they who inhabit the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her
whoredom

173 And he took me away in spirit into the desert And I saw a woman
sitting upon a scarlet coloured beast full of names of blasphemy
having seven heads and ten horns

174 And the woman was clothed round about with purple and scarlet
and gilt with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup
in her hand full of the abomination and filthiness of her fornication

175 And on her forehead a name was written A mystery Babylon the
great the mother of the fornications and the abominations of the
earth

A mystery  That is a secret because what follows of the name and
title of the great harlot is to be taken in a mystical sense
Babylon  Either the city of the devil in general or if this place
be to be understood of any particular city pagan Rome which then and
for three hundred years persecuted the church and was the principal
seat both of empire and idolatry

176 And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with
the blood of the martyrs of Jesus And I wondered when I had seen her
with great admiration

177 And the angel said to me Why dost thou wonder I will tell thee
the mystery of the woman and of the beast which carrieth her which
hath the seven heads and ten horns

178 The beast which thou sawest was and is not and shall come up
out of the bottomless pit and go into destruction And the inhabitants
on the earth whose names are not written in the book of life from the
foundation of the world shall wonder seeing the beast that was and is
not

The beast which thou sawest  This beast which supports Babylon may
signify the power of the devil which was and is not being much
limited by the coming of Christ but shall again exert itself under
Antichrist The seven heads of this beast are seven mountains or
empires instruments of his tyranny of which five were then fallen
See chap 131 and below ver 10 The beast itself is said to be
the eighth and is of the seven because they all act under the devil
and by his instigation so that his power is in them all yet so as to
make up as it were an eighth empire distinct from them all

179 And here is the understanding that hath wisdom The seven heads
are seven mountains upon which the woman sitteth and they are seven
kings

1710 Five are fallen one is and the other is not yet come and when
he is come he must remain a short time

1711 And the beast which was and is not the same also is the eighth
and is of the seven and goeth into destruction

1712 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings who have not
yet received a kingdom but shall receive power as kings one hour
after the beast

Ten kings  Ten lesser kingdoms enemies also of the church of Christ
which nevertheless shall be made instruments of the justice of God
for the punishment of Babylon Some understand this of the Goths
Vandals Huns and other barbarous nations that destroyed the empire
of Rome

1713 These have one design and their strength and power they shall
deliver to the beast

1714 These shall fight with the Lamb And the Lamb shall overcome
them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings and they that are
with him are called and elect and faithful

1715 And he said to me The waters which thou sawest where the
harlot sitteth are peoples and nations and tongues

1716 And the ten horns which thou sawest in the beast These shall
hate the harlot and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her
flesh and shall burn her with fire

1717 For God hath given into their hearts to do that which pleaseth
him that they give their kingdom to the beast till the words of God
be fulfilled

1718 And the woman which thou sawest is the great city which hath
kingdom over the kings of the earth



Apocalypse Chapter 18


The fall of Babylon Kings and merchants lament over her

181 And after these things I saw another angel come down from
heaven having great power and the earth was enlightened with his
glory

182 And he cried out with a strong voice saying Babylon the great
is fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devils and the
hold of every unclean spirit and the hold of every unclean and hateful
bird

183 Because all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with
her And the merchants of the earth have been made rich by the power of
her delicacies

184 And I heard another voice from heaven saying Go out from her
my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive
not of her plagues

185 For her sins have reached unto heaven and the Lord hath
remembered her iniquities

186 Render to her as she also hath rendered to you and double unto
her double according to her works In the cup wherein she hath
mingled mingle ye double unto her

187 As much as she hath glorified herself and lived in delicacies so
much torment and sorrow give ye to her Because she saith in her heart
I sit a queen and am no widow and sorrow I shall not see

188 Therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning
and famine And she shall be burnt with the fire because God is
strong who shall judge her

189 And the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and
lived in delicacies with her shall weep and bewail themselves over
her when they shall see the smoke of her burning

1810 Standing afar off for fear of her torments saying Alas alas
that great city Babylon that mighty city for in one hour is thy
judgment come

1811 And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her
for no man shall buy their merchandise any more

1812 Merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones and of
pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet and all thyine
wood and all manner of vessels of ivory and all manner of vessels of
precious stone and of brass and of iron and of marble

1813 And cinnamon and odours and ointment and frankincense and wine
and oil and fine flour and wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and
chariots and slaves and souls of men

1814 And the fruits of the desire of thy soul are departed from thee
and all fat and goodly things are perished from thee And they shall
find them no more at all

1815 The merchants of these things who were made rich shall stand
afar off from her for fear of her torments weeping and mourning

1816 And saying Alas alas that great city which was clothed with
fine linen and purple and scarlet and was gilt with gold and precious
stones and pearls

1817 For in one hour are so great riches come to nought And every
shipmaster and all that sail into the lake and mariners and as many
as work in the sea stood afar off

1818 And cried seeing the place of her burning saying What city is
like to this great city

1819 And they cast dust upon their heads and cried weeping and
mourning saying Alas alas that great city wherein all were made
rich that had ships at sea by reason of her prices For in one hour
she is made desolate

1820 Rejoice over her thou heaven and ye holy apostles and prophets
For God hath judged your judgment on her

1821 And a mighty angel took up a stone as it were a great
millstone and cast it into the sea saying With such violence as
this shall Babylon that great city be thrown down and shall be found
no more at all

1822 And the voice of harpers and of musicians and of them that play
on the pipe and on the trumpet shall no more be heard at all in thee
and no craftsman of any art whatsoever shall be found any more at all
in thee and the sound of the mill shall be heard no more at all in
thee

1823 And the light of the lamp shall shine no more at all in thee
and the voice of the bridegroom and the bride shall be heard no more at
all in thee For thy merchants were the great men of the earth for all
nations have been deceived by thy enchantments

1824 And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of
all that were slain upon the earth



Apocalypse Chapter 19


The saints glorify God for his judgments on the great harlot Christs
victory over the beast and the kings of the earth

191 After these things I heard as it were the voice of much people
in heaven saying Alleluia Salvation and glory and power is to our
God

192 For true and just are his judgments who hath judged the great
harlot which corrupted the earth with her fornication and hath revenged
the blood of his servants at her hands

193 And again they said Alleluia And her smoke ascendeth for ever
and ever

194 And the four and twenty ancients and the four living creatures
fell down and adored God that sitteth upon the throne saying Amen
Alleluia

195 And a voice came out from the throne saying Give praise to our
God all ye his servants and you that fear him little and great

196 And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the
voice of many waters and as the voice of great thunders saying
Alleluia for the Lord our God the Almighty hath reigned

197 Let us be glad and rejoice and give glory to him For the
marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath prepared herself

198 And it is granted to her that she should clothe herself with fine
linen glittering and white For the fine linen are the justifications
of saints

199 And he said to me Write Blessed are they that are called to the
marriage supper of the Lamb And he saith to me These words of God are
true

1910 And I fell down before his feet to adore him And he saith to
me See thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren who
have the testimony of Jesus Adore God For the testimony of Jesus is
the spirit of prophecy

I fell down before etc  St Augustine lib 20 contra Faust c 21
is of opinion that this angel appeared in so glorious a manner that
St John took him to be God and therefore would have given him divine
honour had not the angel stopped him by telling him he was but his
fellow servant St Gregory Hom 8 in Evang rather thinks that the
veneration offered by St John was not divine honour or indeed any
other than what might lawfully be given but was nevertheless refused
by the angel in consideration of the dignity to which our human nature
had been raised by the incarnation of the Son of God and the dignity
of St John an apostle prophet and martyr

1911 And I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse And he that
sat upon him was called faithful and true and with justice doth he
judge and fight

1912 And his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many
diadems And he had a name written which no man knoweth but himself

1913 And he was clothed with a garment sprinkled with blood And his
name is called THE WORD OF GOD

1914 And the armies that are in heaven followed him on white horses
clothed in fine linen white and clean

1915 And out of his mouth proceedeth a sharp twoedged sword that
with it he may strike the nations And he shall rule them with a rod of
iron and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of
God the Almighty

1916 And he hath on his garment and on his thigh written KING OF
KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS

1917 And I saw an angel standing in the sun and he cried with a loud
voice saying to all the birds that did fly through the midst of
heaven Come gather yourselves together to the great supper of God

1918 That you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of tribunes
and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of them that
sit on them and the flesh of all freemen and bondmen and of little and
of great

1919 And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies
gathered together to make war with him that sat upon the horse and with
his army

1920 And the beast was taken and with him the false prophet who
wrought signs before him wherewith he seduced them who received the
character of the beast and who adored his image These two were cast
alive into the pool of fire burning with brimstone

1921 And the rest were slain by the sword of him that sitteth upon
the horse which proceedeth out of his mouth and all the birds were
filled with their flesh



Apocalypse Chapter 20


Satan is bound for a thousand years The souls of the martyrs reign
with Christ in the first resurrection The last attempts of Satan
against the church The last judgment

201 And I saw an angel coming down from heaven having the key of the
bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand

202 And he laid hold on the dragon the old serpent which is the
devil and Satan and bound him for a thousand years

Bound him etc  The power of Satan has been very much limited by the
passion of Christ for a thousand years that is for the whole time of
the New Testament but especially from the time of the destruction of
Babylon or pagan Rome till the new efforts of Gog and Magog against
the church towards the end of the world During which time the souls
of the martyrs and saints live and reign with Christ in heaven in the
first resurrection which is that of the soul to the life of glory as
the second resurrection will be that of the body at the day of the
general judgment

203 And he cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a
seal upon him that he should no more seduce the nations till the
thousand years be finished And after that he must be loosed a little
time

204 And I saw seats And they sat upon them and judgment was given
unto them And the souls of them that were beheaded for the testimony
of Jesus and for the word of God and who had not adored the beast nor
his image nor received his character on their foreheads or in their
hands And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years

205 The rest of the dead lived not till the thousand years were
finished This is the first resurrection

206 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection
In these the second death hath no power But they shall be priests of
God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years

207 And when the thousand years shall be finished Satan shall be
loosed out of his prison and shall go forth and seduce the nations
which are over the four quarters of the earth Gog and Magog and shall
gather them together to battle the number of whom is as the sand of
the sea

208 And they came upon the breadth of the earth and encompassed the
camp of the saints and the beloved city

209 And there came down fire from God out of heaven and devoured
them and the devil who seduced them was cast into the pool of fire
and brimstone where both the beast

2010 And the false prophet shall be tormented day and night for ever
and ever

2011 And I saw a great white throne and one sitting upon it from
whose face the earth and heaven fled away and there was no place found
for them

2012 And I saw the dead great and small standing in the presence of
the throne And the books were opened and another book was opened
which was the book of life And the dead were judged by those things
which were written in the books according to their works

2013 And the sea gave up the dead that were in it and death and hell
gave up their dead that were in them And they were judged every one
according to their works

2014 And hell and death were cast into the pool of fire This is the
second death

2015 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast
into the pool of fire



Apocalypse Chapter 21


The new Jerusalem described

211 I saw a new heaven and a new earth For the first heaven and the
first earth was gone and the sea is now no more

The first heaven and the first earth was gone  being changed not as
to their substance but in their qualities

212 And I John saw the holy city the new Jerusalem coming down
out of heaven from God prepared as a bride adorned for her husband

213 And I heard a great voice from the throne saying Behold the
tabernacle of God with men and he will dwell with them And they shall
be his people and God himself with them shall be their God

214 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and death
shall be no more Nor mourning nor crying nor sorrow shall be any
more for the former things are passed away

215 And he that sat on the throne said Behold I make all things
new And he said to me Write For these words are most faithful and
true

216 And he said to me It is done I am Alpha and Omega the
Beginning and the End To him that thirsteth I will give of the
fountain of the water of life freely

217 He that shall overcome shall possess these things And I will be
his God and he shall be my son

218 But the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers
and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars they shall
have their portion in the pool burning with fire and brimstone which
is the second death

219 And there came one of the seven angels who had the vials full of
the seven last plagues and spoke with me saying Come and I will shew
thee the bride the wife of the Lamb

2110 And he took me up in spirit to a great and high mountain and he
shewed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God

2111 Having the glory of God and the light thereof was like to a
precious stone as to the jasper stone even as crystal

2112 And it had a wall great and high having twelve gates and in
the gates twelve angels and names written thereon which are the names
of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel

2113 On the east three gates and on the north three gates and on
the south three gates and on the west three gates

2114 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations And in them
the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb

2115 And he that spoke with me had a measure of a reed of gold to
measure the city and the gates thereof and the wall

2116 And the city lieth in a foursquare and the length thereof is
as great as the breadth And he measured the city with the golden reed
for twelve thousand furlongs and the length and the height and the
breadth thereof are equal

2117 And he measured the wall thereof an hundred fortyfour cubits
the measure of a man which is of an angel

The measure of a man ie According to the measure of men and used
by the angel  This seems to be the true meaning of these words

2118 And the building of the wall thereof was of jasper stone but
the city itself pure gold like to clear glass

2119 And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with
all manner of precious stones The first foundation was jasper the
second sapphire the third a chalcedony the fourth an emerald

2120 The fifth sardonyx the sixth sardius the seventh
chrysolite the eighth beryl the ninth a topaz the tenth a
chrysoprasus the eleventh a jacinth the twelfth an amethyst

2121 And the twelve gates are twelve pearls one to each and every
several gate was of one several pearl And the street of the city was
pure gold as it were transparent glass

2122 And I saw no temple therein For the Lord God Almighty is the
temple thereof and the Lamb

2123 And the city hath no need of the sun nor of the moon to shine
in it For the glory of God hath enlightened it and the Lamb is the
lamp thereof

2124 And the nations shall walk in the light of it and the kings of
the earth shall bring their glory and honour into it

2125 And the gates thereof shall not be shut by day for there shall
be no night there

2126 And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into
it

2127 There shall not enter into it any thing defiled or that worketh
abomination or maketh a lie but they that are written in the book of
life of the Lamb



Apocalypse Chapter 22


The water and tree of life The conclusion

221 And he shewed me a river of water of life clear as crystal
proceeding from the throne of God and of the Lamb

222 In the midst of the street thereof and on both sides of the
river was the tree of life bearing twelve fruits yielding its fruits
every month the leaves of the tree for the healing of the nations

223 And there shall be no curse any more but the throne of God and
of the Lamb shall be in it And his servants shall serve him

224 And they shall see his face and his name shall be on their
foreheads

225 And night shall be no more And they shall not need the light of
the lamp nor the light of the sun because the Lord God shall
enlighten then And they shall reign for ever and ever

226 And he said to me These words are most faithful and true And
the Lord God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to shew his
servant the things which must be done shortly

227 And Behold I come quickly Blessed is he that keepeth the words
of the prophecy of this book

228 And I John who have heard and seen these things And after I
had heard and seen I fell down to adore before the feet of the angel
who shewed me the things

229 And he said to me See thou do it not For I am thy fellow
servant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them that keep the
words of the prophecy of this book Adore God

2210 And he saith to me Seal not the words of the prophecy of this
book For the time is at hand

For the time is at hand  That is when compared to eternity all time
and temporal things vanish and are but of short duration As to the
time when the chief predictions should come to pass we have no
certainty as appears by the different opinions both of the ancient
fathers and late interpreters Many think that most things set down
from the 4th chapter to the end will not be fulfilled till a little
time before the end of the world Others are of opinion that a great
part of them and particularly the fall of the wicked Babylon happened
at the destruction of paganism by the destruction of heathen Rome and
its persecuting heathen emperors Of these interpretations see
Aleazar in his long commentary see the learned Bossnet bishop of
Meaux in his treatise on this Book and P Alleman in his notes on
the same Apocalypse tom 12 who in his Preface says that this in a
great measure may be now looked upon as the opinion followed by the
learned men In fine others think that St Johns design was in a
mystical way by metaphors and allegories to represent the attempts
and persecutions of the wicked against the servants of God the
punishments that should in a short time fall upon Babylon that is
upon all the wicked in general the eternal happiness and reward which
God had reserved for the pious inhabitants of Jerusalem that is for
his faithful servants after their short trials and the tribulations of
this mortal life In the mean time we meet with many profitable
instructions and admonitions which we may easily enough understand
but we have no certainty when we apply these predictions to particular
events for as St Jerome takes notice the Apocalypse has as many
mysteries as words or rather mysteries in every word Apocalypsis
Joannis tot habet Sacramenta quot verbaparum dixi in verbis
singulis multiplices latent intelligentiae Ep ad Paulin t 4 p
574 Edit Benedict

2211 He that hurteth let him hurt still and he that is filthy let
him be filthy still and he that is just let him be justified still
and he that is holy let him be sanctified still

Let him hurt still  It is not an exhortation or license to go on in
sin but an intimation that how far soever the wicked may proceed
their progress shall quickly end and then they must expect to meet
with proportionable punishments

2212 Behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to render to
every man according to his works

2213 I am Alpha and Omega the First and the Last the Beginning and
the End

2214 Blessed are they that wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb
that they may have a right to the tree of life and may enter in by the
gates into the city

2215 Without are dogs and sorcerers and unchaste and murderers and
servers of idols and every one that loveth and maketh a lie

2216 I Jesus have sent my angel to testify to you these things in
the churches I am the root and stock of David the bright and morning
star

2217 And the spirit and the bride say Come And he that heareth let
him say Come And he that thirsteth let him come And he that will
let him take the water of life freely

2218 For I testify to every one that heareth the words of the
prophecy of this book If any man shall add to these things God shall
add unto him the plagues written in this book

2219 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of
this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life
and out of the holy city and from these things that are written in
this book

2220 He that giveth testimony of these things saith Surely I come
quickly Amen Come Lord Jesus

2221 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all Amen





APPENDICES



These texts come from the 1582 Rhemes printing of the New Testament see
the History section at the top of the etext The primary sources
provide a glimpse both into the history of the DouayRheims version and
the English language itself The reader will quickly notice that the
letter j does not appear in the texts rather i functions either as a
vowel or a consonant Likewise u is not a distinct letter it is
employed typographically in the lowercase in place of v where not
starting a word The letters u and v both function either as vowels
or consonants The word vniuersity demonstrates this rule The letter
w is sometimes employed but in most cases the earlier form of a
doublev vv appears instead

The transcriber has done his best to render the text accurately Note
the relaxed spelling standards of the time many variants appear While
the errata section from the 1610 edition observed We haue also found
some other faultes of lesse importance and feare there be more But we
trust the reader may easely correct them as they occurre only obvious
errors have been amended Where the transcriber has doubt between
whether an irregular spelling is either an error and a variant the
printed text stands 7bit ASCII cannot fully represent the
typographical standards of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and
many special characters have been replaced with modern equivalents
Where verse numbers stand in the margins of the printed texts they have
been transferred to the body

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL



As recorded in the title the DouayRheims version is a translation
primarily from the Latin Vulgate A brief selection from the preface to
the 1582 edition explains the reasons for this approach Together with
the glossary the text shows the translators scholarly motivations but
also provides a glimpse into the charged climate of the period The
transcriber hopes he did a tolerable job in transliterating the Greek
words in the preface The glossary contains words newly used in the
language of the day Some were later dropped from the Challoner
revision others have found common usage today




THE PREFACE TO THE READER



Treating of the causes vvhy this nevv Testament is translated according
to the auncient vulgar Latin text


THE holy Bible long since translated by vs into English and the old
Testament lying by vs for lacke of good meanes to publish the vvhole in
such sort as a vvorke of so great charge and importance requireth vve
haue yet through Gods goodnes at length fully finished for thee most
Christian reader all the NEVV TESTAMENT vvhich is the principal most
profitable  comfortable peece of holy vvrite and as vvel for all
other institution of life and doctrine as specially for deciding the
doubtes of these daies more propre and pregnant then the other part not
yet printed


NOVV TO GIVE thee also intelligence in particular most gentle Reader of
such thinges as it behoueth thee specially to knovv concerning our
Translation Vve translate the old vulgar Latin text not the common
Greeke text for these causes

1 It is so auncient that it vvas vsed in the Church of God aboue 1300
yeres agoe as appeareth by the fathers of those times

2 It is that by the common receiued opinion and by al probabilitie
vvhich S Hierom aftervvard corrected according to the Greeke by the
appointment of Damasus then Pope as he maketh mention in his preface
before the foure Euangelistes vnto the said Damasus and in Catalogo
in fine and ep 102

3 Consequently it is the same vvhich S Augustine so commendeth and
allovveth in an Epistle to S Hierom

4 It is that vvhich for the most part euer since hath been vsed in the
Churches seruice expounded in sermons alleaged and interpreted in the
Commentaries and vvritings of the auncient fathers of the Latin Church

5 The holy Councel of Trent for these and many other important
considerations hath declared and defined this onely of al other latin
translations to be authentical and so onely to be vsed and taken in
publike lessons disputations preachings and expositions and that no
man presume vpon any pretence to reiect or refuse the same

6 It is the grauest sincerest of greatest maiestie least partialitie
as being vvithout al respect of controuersies and contentions specially
these of our time as appeareth by those places vvhich Erasmus and others
at this day translate much more to the aduantage of the Catholike cause

7 It is so exact and precise according to the Greeke both the phrase
and the word that delicate Heretikes therfore reprehend it of rudenes
And that it follovveth the Greeke far more exactly then the Protestants
translations beside infinite other places we appeale to these
Tit 314 Curent bonis operibus praeesse proissasthai Engl bib
1577 to mainteine good vvorks and Hebr 10 20 Viam nobis
initiauit enekainisen English Bib he prepared So in these
vvordes Iustificationes Traditiones Idola c In al vvhich they
come not neere the Greeke but auoid it of purpose

8 The Aduersaries them selues namely Beza preferre it before al the
rest Inpraefat no Test an 1556 And againe he saith that the old
Interpreter translated very religiously Annot in 1 Luc v 1

9 In the rest there is such diuersitie and dissension and no end of
reprehending one an other and translating euery man according to his
fantasie that Luther said If the vvorld should stand any long time vve
must receiue againe which he thought absurd the Decrees of Councels
for preseruing the vnitie of faith because of so diuers interpretations
of the Scripture And Beza in the place aboue mentioned noteth the
itching ambition of his fellovvtranslators that had much rather
disagree and dissent from the best then seeme them selues to haue said
or vvritten nothing And Bezas translation it self being so esteemed in
our countrie that the Geneua English Testaments be translated according
to the same yet sometime goeth so vvide from the Greeke and from the
meaning of the holy Ghost that them selues which protest to translate
it dare not folow it For example Luc 336 They haue put these
wordes The sonne of Cainan which he wittingly and wilfully left out
and Act 114 they say Vvith the vvomen agreably to the vulgar
Latin where he saith Cum vxoribus vvith their vviues

10 It is not onely better then al other Latin translations but then the
Greeke text it self in those places where they disagree

The proofe hereof is euident because most of the auncient Heretikes were
Grecians  therfore the Scriptures in Greeke were more corrupted by
them as the auncient fathers often complaine Tertullian noteth the
Greeke text which is at this day 1 Cor 1547 to be an old corruption
of Marcion the Heretike and the truth to be as in our vulgar latin
Secundus homo de caelo caelestis The second man from heauen
heauenly So reade other auncient fathers and Erasmus thinketh it must
needes be so and Caluin him self folovveth in Instit li 2 c 13
parag 2 Againe S Hierom noteth that the Greeke text 1 Cor 7 33
which is at this day is not the Apostolical veritie or the true text
of the Apostle but that which is in the vulgar Latin Qui cum vxore
est solicitus est quae sunt mundi quomodo placeat vxori  diuisus
est He that is vvith a vvife is careful of vvorldly things hovv he
may please his vvife and is deuided or distracted The Ecclesiastical
historie called the Tripartite noteth the Greeke text that now is
1 Io 4 3 to be an old corruption of the auncient Greeke copies by
the Nestorian Heretikes  the true reading to be as in our vulgar Latin
Omnis spiritus qui soluit IESVM Ex Deo non est Euery spirit that
dissolueth IESVS is not of God and Beza confesseth that Socrates in
his Ecclesiastical historie readeth so in the Greeke

But the proofe is more preganant out of the Aduersaires them selues
They forsake the Greeke text as corrupted and translate according to the
vulgar Latin namely Beza and his scholers the English translatours of
the Bible in these places Hebr chap 9 vers 1 saying The first
couenant for that vvhich is in the Greeke The first tabernacle
vvhere they put couenant not as of the text but in an other letter
as to be vnderstood according to the vulgar Latin vvhich most sincerely
leaueth it out altogether saying Habuit quidem  prius iustificationes
c The former also in deede had iustifications c Againe Ro 11
vers 21 They translate not according to the Greek text Tempori
seruientes seruing the time vvhich Beza sayth must needes be a
corruption but according to the vulgar Latin Domino seruientes
seruing our Lord Againe Apoc 11 vers 2 they translate not the
Greeke text Atrium quod intra templum est the court vvhich is
vvithin the temple but cleane contrarie according to the vulgar
Latin vvhich Beza saith is the true reading Atrium quod est foris
templum the court vvhich is vvithout the temple Onely in this last
place one English Bible of the yere 1562 folovveth the errour of the
Greeke Againe 2 Tim 23 vers 14 they adde but more then is in
the Greeke to make the sense more commodious and easie according as it
is in the vulgar Latin Againe Ia 5 12 they leaue the Greeke and
folovv the vulgar Latin saying lest you fall into condemnation I
doubt not saith Beza but this is the true and sincere reading and I
suspect the corruption in the Greeke came thus c It vvere infinite to
set dovvne al such places vvhere the Aduersaries specially Beza folovv
the old vulgar Latin and the Greeke copie agreable therevnto condemning
the Greeke text that novv is of corruption




HARD VVORDES EXPLICATED

the vulgar reader vvhich might not conueniently be vttered otherwise


A

Abstracted Dravven avvay James 114
Acquisition Getting purchasing Eph 114
Aduent The comming Matt 2427
Adulterating Corrupting 2 Cor 217 The Greeke vvord signifieth to
 to make commoditie of the vvord of God as vulgar Vinteners do of their
 vvine Vvhereby is expressed the peculiar trade of al Heretikes and
 exceding proper to the Protestants that so corrupt Scriptures
 by mixture of their ovvne phantasies by false translations glosses
 colorable and pleasant commentaries to deceiue the tast of the simple
 as tauerners and tapsters do to make their vvines salable by manifold
 artificial deceites The Apostles contrarievvise as all Catholikes
 deliuer the Scriptures and vtter the vvord of God sincerely and
 entirely in the same sense and sort as the fathers left them to the
 Church interpreting them by the same Spirit by vvhich they vvere
 vvritten or spoken
Agnition Knovvledge or acknovvledging Philemon 16
Allegorie A Mystical speache more then the bare letter Gal 424
 Here vve learne that the holy Scriptures haue beside the litteral

 persons reported both the speaches and the actions being
 significatiue ouer and aboue the letter
Amen What is it vvhen our Lord saith Amen amen He doth much commend
 and vrge the thing he so vttereth doubling it Amen in Hebrue
 signifieth verum a truth John 834
Anathema By vse of Scripture is either that vvhich by separation from
 profane vse and by dedication to God is holy dreadful and not
 vulgarly to be touched or contrarievvise that which is reiected

 Apostles and deliuered to their successors and comming dovvne from
 one Bishop to an other is called the Depositum as it vvere a thing
 laid into their hands and committed vnto them to keepe Vvhich
 because it passeth from hand to hand from age to age from Bishop to
 Bishop vvithout corruption change or alteration is al one vvith
 Tradition and is the truth giuen vnto the holy Bishops to keepe and
 not to lay men 1 Tim 620 It may signifie also Gods graces giuen
 vs to keepe A great comfort to al Christians that euery of their
 goode deedes and sufferings for Christ and al the vvorldly losses
 susteined for defense or confession of their faith be extant vvith
 God and kept as depositum to be repaied or receiued againe in heauen
 2 Tim 11214
Didrachme These didrachmes were peeces of money which they payed for
 tribute Matt 172324
Dominical day Sunday Apoc 110 It is to be marked that this holy
 day by the Apostles tradition also vvas named Dominicus dies our
 Lordes day or the Dominike vvhich is also an old Ecclesiastical vvord
 in our language for the name Sunday is a heathenish calling as al
 other of the vveeke daies be in our language
Donaries Giftes offered to God for his Temple c Luke 215

 him Gal 54 The scandal of the crosse euacuated that is made
 voide cleane taken avvay Gal 511
Euangelize Signifieth such preaching of good tidinges as concerneth
 the Gospel How is it possible to expresse Euangelizo but as vve do
 Euangelize for Euangelium being the Gospel what is Euangelizo or to

 therfore to translate it by any one of them only is perhaps to
 abridge the sense of this place John 1416

 Parasceue is as solemne a word for the Sabboth eue as Sabboth is for
 the Iewes seuenth day and now among Christians much more solemner
 taken for Goodfriday onely These wordes then we thought it far
 better to keepe in the text and to tel their signification in the

charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For forty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
