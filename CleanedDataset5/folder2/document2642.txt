INTRODUCTION

GENTLE READERLet me make you acquainted with my book Back Home
Your right hand Book your right hand Pitys sakes How many times
have I got to tell you that Chest up and forward shoulders back and
down and turn your toes out more

It is a little book Gentle Reader but please dont let that prejudice
you against it The General Public I know likes to feel heft in its
hand when it buys a book but I had hoped that you were a peg or two
above the General Public That mythical being goes on a reading spree
about every so often and it selects a book which will probably last out
the craving a book which it will be impossible to lay down after it
is once begun until it is finished I quote from the standard book
notice A few hours later the following dialogue ensues


Henry

Yes dear

Arent you most done reading

Just as soon as I finish this chapter A sigh and a long wait

Henry

Yes dear

Did you lock the sidedoor No answer

Henry Did you

Did I what

Did you lock the sidedoor

In a minute now

Yes but did you

Mhm I guess so

Guess so Did you lock that sidedoor They got in at Hilliards
night before last and stole a bag of clothespins

M

Oh put down that book and go and lock the sidedoor Ill not get a
wink of sleep this blessed night unless you do

In a minute now Just wait till I finish this

Go do it now

Mr General Public has a card on his desk that says Do it Now and so
he lays down his book with a patient sigh and comes back to it with a
patent grouch

Oh so it is says the voice from the bedroom I remember now I
locked it myself when I put the milkbottles out Im going to stop
taking of that man unless theres more cream on the top than there has
been here lately

M

Henry

Oh what is it

Arent you most done reading

In a minute just as soon as I finish this chapter

How long is that chapter for mercys sakes

I began another

Henry

What

Arent you coming to bed pretty soon You know I cant go to sleep when
you are sitting up

Oh hush up for one minute cant ye Its a funny thing if I cant
read a little once in a while

Its a funny thing if Ive got to be broke of my rest this way As much
as I have to look after Id hate to be so selfish Henry Wont you
please put the book down and come to bed

Oh for goodness sake Turn over and go to sleep You make me tired

Every two or three hours Mrs General Public wakes up and announces that
she cant get a wink of sleep not a wink she wishes he hadnt brought
the plagued old book home he hasnt the least bit of consideration for
her please please wont he put the book away and come to bed

He reaches THE END at 230AM turns off the gas and creeps into
bed his stomach all upset from smoking so much without eating anything
his eyes feeling like two burnt holes in a blanket and wishing that
he had the sense he was born with Hell have to be up at 605 and he
knows how he will feel He also knows how he will feel along about three
oclock in the afternoon Smithers is coming then to close up that deal
Smithers is as sharp as tacks as slippery as an eel and as crooked as
a dogs hind leg Always looking for the best of it You need all
your wits when you deal with Smithers Why didnt he take Mrs General
Publics advice and get to bed instead of sitting up fuddling himself
with that fool lovestory

Thats how a book should be to be a great popular success and one
that all the typewriter girls will have on their desks I am guiltily
conscious that Back Home is not up to standard either in avoirdupois
heft or the power to unfit a man for business

Heres a book Is it long No Is it exciting No Any lost diamonds
in it Nup Mysterious murders No Whopping big fortune now teetering
this way and now teetering that tipping over on the Hero at the last
and smothering him in an avalanche of fiftydollar bills No Does She
get Him Isnt even that No heart interest at all Whats the use of
putting out good money to make such a book to have a cover design for
it to get a man like A B Frost to draw illustrations for it when he
costs so like the mischief when theres nothing in the book to make a
man sit up till way past bedtime Why print it at all

You may search me I suppose its all right but if it was my money
Ill bet I could make a better investment of it If worst came to worst
I could do like the fellow in the story who went to the gamblinghouse
and found it closed up so he shoved the money under the door and went
away Hed done his part

And yet on the other hand I can see how some sort of a case can be
made out for this book of mine I suppose I am wrongI generally am in
regard to everythingbut it seems to me that quite a large part of the
population of this country must be grownup people If I am right
in this contention then this large part of the population is being
unjustly discriminated against I believe in doing a reasonable amount
for the aid and comfort of the young things that are just beginning to
turn their hair up under or who rub a stealthy forefinger over their
upper lips to feel the pleasant rasp but I dont believe in their
monopolizing everything I dont think it s fair All the books
printedexcept of course those containing valuable information we
dont buy those books but go to the public library for themall the
books printed are concerned with the problem of How She can get Him and
He can get Her

Well now It was either yesterday morning or the day before that you
looked in the glass and beheld there The First Gray Hair You smiled a
smile that was not all pure pleasure a smile that petered out into a
sigh but nevertheless a smile I will contend What do you think
about it Youre still on earth arent you Youll last the month out
anyhow wont you Not at all ready to be laid on the shelf What do you
think of the relative importance of Love Courtship and Marriage One
or two other things in life just about as interesting arent there
Take getting a living for instance That s worthy of ones attention
to a certain extent When our young ones ask us Pop what did you say
to Mom when you courted her they feel provoked at us for taking it so
lightly and so frivolously It vexes them for us to reply Law child
I dont remember Why I says to her Will you have me And she says
Why yes and jump at the chance What difference does it make what
we said or whether we said anything at all Why should we charge our
memories with the recollections of those few and foolish months of mere
instinctive sexattraction when all that really counts came after
the years wherein low passion blossomed into lofty Love the dear
companionship in joy and sorrow and in that which is more far more
than either joy or sorrow the daily round the common task All that
is wonderful to think of in our courtship is the marvel for which
we should never cease to thank the Almighty God that with so little
judgment at our disposal we should have chosen so wisely

If you Gentle Reader found your first gray hair day before yesterday
morning if you can remember way way back ten or fifteen years
ago er er or more come with me Let us go Back Home Heres
your transportation all made out to you and in your hand It is no use
my reminding you that no railroad goes to the old home place It isnt
there any more even in outward seeming Cumminss woods where you had
your robbers cave is all cleared off and cut up into building lots
The cool and echoing covered bridge plastered with notices of dead and
forgotten Strawberry Festivals and Public Vendues has long ago been
torn down to be replaced by a smart red iron bridge The Volunteer
Firemens Enginehouse whose brick wall used to flutter with the gay
rags of circusbills is gone as if it never were at all Where the
Union Schoolhouse was is all torn up now They are putting up a new
magnificent structure with all the modern improvements exposed
plumbing and spankless discipline The quiet leafy streets echo to the
hissing snarl of trolley cars and the powerhouse is right by the
Old Swimminghole above the dam The meetinghouse where we attended
Sabbathschool and marveled at the Greek temple frescoed on the wall
behind the pulpit is now a church with a big organ and stainedglass
windows and folding operachairs on a slanting floor There isnt any
Amen Corner any more and in these calm and wellbred times nobody
ever gets shouting happy

But even when the loved spots that our infancy knew are physically the
same a change has come upon them more saddening than words can tell
They have shrunken and grown shabbier They are not nearly so spacious
and so splendid as once they were

Some one comes up to you and calls you by your name His voice echoes in
the chambers of your memory You hold his hand in yours and try to peer
through the falseface he has on the mask of a beard or spectacles or
a changed expression of the countenance He says he is Soandso Why
he used to sit with you in Miss Crutchers room dont you remember
There was a time when you and he walked together your arms upon each
others shoulders But this is some other one than he The boy you knew
had freckles and could spit between his teeth ever and ever so far

They dont have the same things to eat they used to have or if they
do it all tastes different Do you remember the old well with the
windlass and the chain fastened to the rope just above the bucket the
chain that used to cluckcluck when the dripping bucket came within
reach to be swung upon the wellcurb How cold the water used to be
right out of the northwest corner of the well It made the roof of your
mouth ache when you drank Everybody said it was such splendid water It
isnt so very cold these days and I think it has a sort of funny taste
to it

Ah Gentle Reader this is not really Back Home we gaze upon when
we go there by the train It is a last years birds nest The nest is
there the birds are flown the birds of youth and noisy health and
ravenous appetite and inexperience You cannot go Back Home by train
but here is the magic wishingcarpet and here is your transportation in
your hand all made out to you You and I will make the journey together
Let us in heart and mind thither ascend

I went to the Old Red Schoolhouse with you Dont you remember me I
was learning to swim when you could go clear across the river without
once letting down I saw you at the County Fair and bought a slab
of icecream candy just before you did I was in the infantclass in
Sabbathschool when you spoke in the dialogue at the monthly concert
Look again Dont you remember me I used to stub my toe so you ought
to recollect me by that I know plenty of people that you know I may
not always get their names just right but then its been a good while
ago You Il recognize them though youll know them in a minute

THE OLD RED SCHOOLHOUSE


 Oh the little old red schoolhouse on the hill
 2d bass On the hill
 Oh the little old red schoolhouse on the hill
 2d bass On the hihihiyull
 And my heart with joy oerflows
 Like the dewdrop in the rose
 Thinking of the old red SCHOOLHOUSE I ooon the hill
 2d tenor and 1st bass The hill the hill

 THE MALE QUARTETS COMPENDIUM


  I call your attention to the chaste beauty of this line
 and the imperative necessity of the chord of the diminished
 seventh for the word rose Also schoolhouse in the
 last line must be very loud and staccato Snap it off


If the audience will kindly come forward and occupy the vacant seats
in the front of the hall the entertainment will now begin The male
quartet will first render an appropriate selection and then Cant
you see them from where you are Let me assist you in the visualization

The first tenor the gentleman on the extreme left is a stocky little
man with a large chest and short legs conspicuously curving inward He
has plenty of white teeth ashblonde hair and goes smoothshaven for
purely personal reasons His round doughcolored face will never look
older from a distance than it did when he was nine The flight of
years adds only deeper creases in the multitude of fine wrinkles and
increasing difficulty in hoisting his tiny patentleather foot up on
his plump knee

The second tenor leans toward him in a way to make another man anxious
about his watch but the second tenor is as honest as the day He is
only blending the voices He works in the bank He is going to be
married in June sometime Dont look around right away but shes the
one in the pink shirtwaist the second one from the aisle the one
two three the sixth row back See her Say theyve got it bad
those two What d ye think She goes down by the bank every day at
noon so as to walk up with him to luncheon She lives across the
street and as soon as ever she has finished her luncheon there she is
out on the front porch hallooing Oohoo How about that And if he so
much as looks at another girlmM

The first bass is one of these fellows with a flutter in his voice
No I dont mean a vibrato Its a flutter like a goats tail It is
considered real operatic

The second bass has a great big Adams apple that slides up and down
his throat like a toymonkey on a stick He is tall and has eyebrows
like clothesbrushes and he scowls fit to make you run and hide under
the bed He is really a goodhearted fellow though Pity he has the
dyspepsia so bad Oh my yes Suffers everything with it poor man
He generally sings that song about Drinking DRINKang Drinkawng
though hes strictly temperate himself When he takes that last low
note you hold on to your chair for fear youll fall in too

But why bring in the male quartet

Because The Little Old Red Schoolhouse is more than a mere
collocation of words accurately descriptive It is what Mat King would
call a symblem and as such requires the musics dying fall to lull
and enervate a too meticulous and stringent tendency to recollect that
it wasnt little or old or red or on a hill It might have been
big and new and built of yellow brick right next to the Second
Presbyterian and hence close to the branch so that the spring
freshets flooded the playground and the water lapped the base of the
big rock on which we played King on the Castlethe big rock so
pitifully dwindled of late years No matter what he facts are Sing of
The Little Old Red Schoolhouse On the Hill and in everybodys heart
a chord trembles in unison As we hear its witching strains we are all
lodge brethren from Maine to California and far across the Western Sea
we are all lodge brethren and the air is Auld Lang Syne and we are
clasping hands across knitted together into one living solidarity
and this if we but sensed it is the real Union of which the federal
compact is but the outward seeming It is a Union in which they have
neither art nor part whose parents sent them to private schools so as
not to have them associate with that class of people It is the
true democracy which batters down the walls that separate us from each
otherthe walls of caste distinction and color prejudice and national
hatred and religious contempt all the petty antisocial meannesses
that quarrel with

 The Union of hearts the Union of hands
 And the flag of our Union forever

Old Glory has floated victoriously on many a gallant fight by sea
and land but never do its silver stars glitter more bravely or its
bloodred stripes curve more proudly on the fawning breeze than when it
floats above the schoolhouse over the daily battle against ignorance
and prejudice which is ignorance of our fellows for freedom and for
equal rights It is no mere pretty sentimentality that puts the flag
there but the serious recognition of the bedrock principle of our
Union That we are all of one blood one bounden duty that all these
antisocial prejudices are just as shameful as illiteracy and that they
must disappear as soon as ever we shall come to know each other well
Knowledge is power That is true And it is also true A house divided
against itself cannot stand

The Flag of our Union forever is our prayer our hearts desire for
us and for our children after us Heroes have died to give us that
heroes that with glazing eyes beheld the tattered ensign and spent their
latest breath to cheer it as it passed on to triumph We who are about
to die salute thee The heart swells to think of it But it swells
too to think that day by day thousands upon thousands of little
children stretch out their hands toward that Flag and pledge allegiance
to it We who are about to LIVE salute thee

It is no mere chance affair that all our federal buildings should be so
ugly and so begrudged and that our schoolhouses should be so beautiful
architecturallythe one nearest my house is built from plans that took
the first prize at the Paris Exposition in competition with the
whole worldso wellappointed and so far from being grudged that the
complaint is that there are not enough of them

That Soandso should be the President and suchandsuch a party
have control is but a game we play at amateurs and professionals the
serious business is that in this country no child how poor soever it
may be shall have the slightest let or hindrance in the equal chance
with every other child to learn to read and write and cipher and do
raffiawork

It is a new thing with us to have splendid schoolhouses After all the
norm as you might say is still The Old Red Schoolhouse You must
recollect how hard the struggle is for the poor farmer with wheat only
a dollar a bushel and eggs only six for a quarter with every year
or so taxes of three and sometimes four dollars on an eightyacre farm
grinding him to earth It were folly to expect more in rural districts
than a tight box with benches and a stove in it Nevertheless it is
the thing signified more than its outward seeming that catches and holds
the eye upon the country schoolhouse as you drive past it You count
yourself fortunate if mingled with the creaking of the buggysprings
you hear the hum of recitation yet more fortunate if it is recess time
and you can see the children out at play the little girls holding to
one anothers dresstails as they solemnly circle to the chant

 Hyar way gow rand tha malbarry bosh
 Tha malbarry bosh tha malbarry bosh
 Hyar way gow rand tha malbarry bosh
 On a cayum and frasty marneng

The boys are at marbles if it is muddy enough or oneoldcat or
pompompeelaway with the normal percentage of them in reboant
tearsthat is to say one in three

But even this is not the moment of illumination when it comes upon you
like a flood how glorious is the land we live in upon what sure and
certain footing are its institutions when we know by spiritual insight
that whatsoever be the trial that awaits us the people of these United
States we shall be able for it Yes We shall be able for it

If you would learn the secret of our nations greatness take your stand
some winters morning just before nine oclock where you can overlook a
circle of some two or three miles radius the center being the Old Red
Schoolhouse You will see little figures picking their way along the
miry roads or ploughing through the deep drifts cutting across the
fields all drawing to the schoolhouse Bub in his wammus and his
cowhide boots his cap with earlaps a knitted comforter about his
neck and his hands glowing in scarlet mittens and little Sis in a
thick shawl trudging along behind him stepping in his tracks They
chirrup Goodmorning sir As far as you can see them you have to
watch them and something rises in your throat Lord love em Lord love
the children

And then it comes to you and it makes you catch your breath to think of
it that every two or three miles all over this land wherever there are
children at all there is the Old Red Schoolhouse At this very hour a
living tide upbearing the hopes and prayers of God alone knows how many
loving hearts the tide on which all of our longedfor ships are to come
in is setting to the schoolhouse Oh what is martial glory what is
conquest of an empire what is statecraft alongside of this Happy is
the people that is in such a case

The city schools are now the pattern for the country schools but in
my day although a little they were pouring the new wine of frothing
educational reform into the old bottles they had not quite attained the
full distention of this present We still had some kind of a good
time but nothing like the good times they had out at the school near
grandpaps where I sometimes visited There you could whisper Yes
sir you could whisper So long as you didnt talk out loud it was all
right And there was no rising at the tap of the bell forming in line
and walking in lockstep Seemingly it never entered the schoolboards
heads that anybody would ever be sent to states prison They left the
scholars unprepared for any such career They have remedied all that in
city schools Now when a boy grows up and goes to Sing Sing he knows
exactly what to do and how to behave It all comes back to him

But what I call the finest part of going to school in the country was
that you didnt go home to dinner Grandma had a boy only a few years
older than I was and when I went avisiting she fixed us up a piece
They call it luncheon now I thinka foolish hybrid mongrel of a
word made up of lump a piece of bread and noon and shenk
a pouring or drink But the right name is piece What made this
particular piece taste so wonderfully good was that it was in a
roundbottomed basket woven of splints dyed blue and black and red
and all in such a funny pattern It was an Indian basket My grandmas
mother when she was a little girl got that from the squaw of old Chief
WipingStick

The piece had breadandbutter my grandma used to let me churn
for her sometimes when I went out there and some of the slices had
applebutter on them One time she let me stir the cider when it was
boiling down in the big kettle over the chunkfire out in the yard The
smoke got in my eyes Sometimes there was honey from the hives over by
the gooseberry bushesthe gooseberries had stickers on themand we had
slices of cold fried ham I was out at grandpaps one time when they
butchered They had a chunkfire then too to heat the water to scald
the hogs And say Did your grandma ever roast pigs tails in the ashes
for you And there were crullers No I dont mean doughnuts I mean
crullers all twisted up They go good with cider Sometimes my grandma
cut out thin pallid little men of cruller dough and dropped them into
the hot lard for my Uncle Jimmy and me And when she fished them out
they were all swelled up and pussy and golden brown

And there was pie Neither at the school nooning nor at the table did
one put a piece of pie upon a plate and haggle at it with a fork You
took the piece of pie up in your hand and pointed the sharp end toward
you and gently crowded it into your face It didnt require much
pressure either

And there were always apples real apples I think they must make apples
in factories nowadays They taste like it These were real ones picked
off the trees Out at grandpaps they had bellflowers and winesaps and
seeknofurthers and I think sheepnoses and one kind of apple that
I cant find any more though I have sought it carefully It was the
finest apple I ever set a tooth in It was the juiciest and the spiciest
apple It had sort of a rollicking flavor to it if you know what I
mean It certainly was the ne plus ultra of an apple And the name of it
was the rambo Dear me how good it was think Id sooner have one right
now than great riches And all these apples they kept in the applehole
You went out and uncovered the earth and there they were all in a big
nest of straw and such a gush of perfume distilled from that pile of
them that just to recollect it makes my mouth all wet

They had a big red apple in those days that I forget the name of Oh it
was a whopper Youd nibble at it and nibble at it before you could
get a purchase on it Then after you got your teeth in youd pull and
pull and all of a sudden the apple would go tock and your head would
fly back from the recoil and you had a bite about the size of your
hand You chomped on it with your cheek all bulged out and blame
near drowned yourself with the juice of it

Noontime the girls used to count the seeds

 One I love two I love three my love I see
 Four I love with all my heart and five I cast away
 Six he loves seven she loves eight eight

I forget what eight is and all that follows after And then the others
would tease her with Aw Jennie knowing who it was she had named
the apple for Wes Rinehart or Lonzo Curl or whoever And youd
be standing there by the stove kind of grinning and not thinking of
anything in particular when somebody would hit you a clout on your back
that just about broke you in two and would tell you to pass it on
and youd pass it on and the next thing was youd think the house was
coming down Such a chasing around and over benches and upsetting the
waterbucket and tearing up Jack generally that teacher would say
Boys boys If you cant play quietly youll have to go out of doors
Play quietly Why the idea What kind of play is it when you are right
still

Outdoors in the country you can whoop and holler and carry on and
nobody complains to the board of health And there are so many things
you can do If there is just the least little fall of snow you can make
a big wheel with spokes in it by your tracking I remember that it was
called fox and geese but thats all I can remember about it If there
was a little more snow you tried to wash the girls faces in it and
sometimes got yours washed If there was a good deal of wet snow you had
a snowball fight which is great fun unless you get one right smack dab
in your earoh but I cant begin to tell you all the fun there is at
the noon hour in the country school that the town children dont know
anything about And when it was time for school to take up there
wasnt any forming in line with a monitor to run tell teacher who
snatched off Joseph Humphreys cap and flung it far away so he had to
get out of the line and who did this and who did thatno penitentiary
business at all Teacher tapped on the window with a ruler and the boys
and girls came in redfaced and puffing careering through the aisles
knocking things off the desks with many a burlesque oh exCUSE me
and falling into their seats bursting into sniggers they didnt know
what at They had an hour and a half nooning Counting that it took five
minutes to shovel down even grandmas beautiful piece that left an
hour and twentyfive minutes for roaring romping play If you want to
know I think that is fully as educational and a far better preparation
for life than sitting still with your nose stuck in a book

In the city schools they dont think so Even the stingy fifteen
minutes recess morning and afternoon has been stolen from the
children Instead is given the inspiriting physical culture all making
silly motions together in a nice warm room full of secondhand air
Is it any wonder that one in every three that die between fifteen and
twentyfive dies of consumption

You must have noticed that almost everybody that amounts to anything
spent his early life in the country The city schools have great
educational advantages they have all the uptodate methods but the
output of the Old Red Schoolhouse compares very favorably with that of
the city schools for all that The twomile walk morning and evening
had something to do with it not only because it and the long nooning
were good exercise but because it impressed upon the mind that what
cost so much effort to get must surely be worth having But I think I
know another reason

If the city child goes through the arithmetic once it is as much as
ever In the Old Red Schoolhouse those who hadnt gone through the
arithmetic at least six times were little thought of In town the last
subject in the book was Permutation to which you gave the mere look
its essentially frivolous nature deserved It was End of the line All
out But in the country a very important department followed It was
called Problems They were twisters able to make How old is Ann
look like a last years birds nest They make a big fuss about the
psychology of the childs mind nowadays Well I tell you they couldnt
teach the man that got up that arithmetic a thing about the operation of
the childs mind He knew what was what He didnt put down the answers
He knew that if he did weak erring human nature tortured by suspense
determined to have the agony over would multiply by four and divide by
thirteen and subtract 127didnt either I didnt say substract I
guess I know theyd get the answer somehow it didnt matter much how

In the country they ciphered through this part and handed in their sums
to Teacher who said shed take em home and look em over she didnt
have time just then As if that fooled anybody She had a key And when
you had done the very last one on the very last page and there wasnt
anything more except the blank pages where you had written Joe Geiger
loves Molly Meyers and If my name you wish to see look on page
103 and all such stuff then you turned over to the beginning where
it says Arithmetic is the science of numbers and the art of computing
by them and once more considered Ann had four apples and her brother
gave her two more How many did she then have There were the four
apples in a row and the two apples and you that had worried over
meadows so long and so wide and men mowing them in so many days and
a half had to think how many apples Ann really did have Some of the
fellows with forked hairs on their chins and uncertain voicesthe big
fellows in the back seats where the applecores and the spitballs come
from knew every example in the book by heart

And there is yet another reason why the country school has brought forth
men of whom we do well to be proud At the countyseat every so often
the school commissioners held an examination Thither resorted many for
the most part anxious to determine if they really knew as much as they
thought they did If you took that examination and got a stiff kit
for eighteen months you had good cause to hold your head up and step
as high as a blind horse A stiff kit for eighteen months is no small
thing let me tell you I dont know if there is anything corresponding
to a doctors hood for such as win a certificate to teach school for
two years handrunning but there ought to be A fellow ought not to
be obliged to resort to such tactics as taking out a folded paper and
perusing it in the hope that some one will ask him What you got there
Calvin so as to give you a chance to say carelessly Oh jist a
stiffkit for two years

When you get as far along as that you simply have to take a term in
the junior Prep Department at college not because there is anything
left for you to learn but for the sake of putting a gloss on your
education finishing it off neatly

And then if you were going to read law with Mr Parker or study
medicine with old Doc Harbaugh and you kind of run out of clothes you
took that certificate and hunted up a school and taught it Sometimes
they paid you as high as 20 a month and board lots of board real
buckwheat cakes riz buckwheat not the prepared kind and real maple
syrup and real sausage the kind that has sage in it the kind that you
cant coax your butcher to sell you The pale tasteless stuff he gives
you for sausage I wouldnt throw out to the chickens Twenty dollars a
month and board Thats 4 a month more than a hired man gets

But it wasnt alone the demonstration that strange as it might seem
it was possible for a man to get his living by his wits though that
has done much to produce great men as it was the actual exercise of
teaching Remember the big boys on the back seats where the applecores
and the spitballs come from The schooldirector that hired you gave
you a searching lookover and said Mwellll Im afraid you haint
hardly qualified for our schooloh thats all right sir thats all
right Your stiffkit is firstrate and you got good recommends good
recommends but I was thinkinwell I tell you Mights well out with
it first as last I d knows I ort to say so but this here district
No 34 is a poot tolable hard school to teach Yauss A pootty
tolable hard school to teach Now thats jist the plumb facts in the
matter Weve had four try it this winter aready One of em stuck it
out four weeksI jimminy he had grit that feller had The balance of
em didnt take so long to make up their minds Well now if youre a
mind to try itI was goin to say you didnt look to me like you had
the heft Like to have you the worst way Now if you want to back
out Well all right Monday mornin eh Well you got my
sympathies

I believe that some have tried to figure out that St Martin of Tours
ought to be the patron saint of the United States One of his feastdays
falls on July 4 and his colors are red white and blue But I rather
prefer myself the Boanerges the two sons of Zebedee When asked Are
ye able to drink of this cup they answered We are able They didnt
in the least know what it was but they knew they were able for anything
that anybody else was and perhaps able for a little more At any
rate they were willing to chance it Thats the United States of
America clear to the bone and back again to the skin

You ask any really great man Have you ever taught a winter term in a
country school If he says he hasnt then depend upon it he isnt
a really great man People only think he is The winter term breeds
Boanergessons of thunder Yes and of lightning too Something struck
the big boys in the back seats as sure as youre a foot high and if it
wasnt lightning what was it Brute strength for brute strength they
were more than a match for Teacher It was up to him It was either
prove himself the superior power or slink off home and crawl under the
porch

The curriculum of the Old Red Schoolhouse which was until lately the
universal curriculum consisted in reading writing and arithmetic or
ciphering I like the word ciphering because it makes me think of
slatesslates that were always falling on the floor with a rousing
clatter so that almost always at least one corner was cracked Some
mitigation of the noise was gained by binding the frame with strips of
red flannel thus adding warmth and brightness to the color scheme Just
as some fertile brain conceived the notion of applying a knob of rubber
to each corner slates went out and I suppose only doctors buy them
nowadays to hang on the doors of their offices Maybe the teachers
nerves were too highly strung to endure the squeaking of gritty pencils
but I think the real reason for their banishment is that slates invited
too strongly the game of noughts and crosses or tittattoe three in
a row the champion of indoor sports and one entirely inimical to the
study of the joggerfy lesson But if slates favored tittattoe they
also favored ciphering and nothing but good can come from that Paper
is now so cheap that you need not rub out mistakes but paper and pencil
can never surely ground one in the science of numbers and the art of
computing by them What is written is written and returns to plague
the memory but if you made a mistake on the slate you could spit on it
and rub it out with your sleeve and leave no trace of the error either
on the writing surface or the tables of the memory What does the hymn
say

 Forget the steps already trod
 And onward urge thy way

The girls used to keep a little sponge and some water in a discarded
patchouli bottle with a glass stopper to wash their slates with but it
always seemed to me that the human and wholehearted way was otherwise

Reading writing and arithmeticthese three and the greatest of
these three is arithmetic Over against it stands grammar which may be
said to be derived from reading and writing Show me a man that as
a boy at school excelled in arithmetic and I will show you a useful
citizen a boss in his own business a leader of men show me the boy
that preferred grammar that read expressively that wrote a
beautiful hand and curled his capital Ss till their tails looked like
mainsprings and I will show you a dreamer and a sentimentalista man
that works for other people While I have breath in me I will maintain
the supereminence of arithmetic There is no room for disputation in
arithmetic no exceptions to the rule Twice two is four and thats
all there is about it but whether there be pronunciations they shall
cease whether there be rules of grammar they shall vanish away Why
look here Its a rule of grammar isnt it that the subject of a
sentence must be put in the nominative case Let it kick and bite and
hang on to the desks all it wants to in it goes and the door is slammed
on it You think so What is the word you Second person plural
number objective case Oh no the nominative form is ye

Dont you remember it says Woe unto you ye lawyers Those who fight
against Him and me went down town fight against the stars in
their courses for the objective case in every language is bound and
determined to be The Whole Thing Arithmetic alone is founded on a rock
All else is fleeting all else is futile chaotica waste of time What
is reading but a rival of morphine There are probably as many men in
prison sent there by Reading as by Rum

Oh not good Reading says the publisher

Not good Rum either says the publican

Fight it out Its an even thing between the two of you Literature and
Liquor Books and Booze which can take a mans mind off his business
most effectually

Still merely as a matter of taste I will defend the quality of
McGuffeys School Readers against all comers I dont know who McGuffey
was but certainly he formed the greatest intellects of our age
present company not excepted The true test of literature is its eternal
modernity A thing of beauty is a joy forever It always seems of the
age in which it is read Now almost the earliest lection in McGuffeys
First Reader goes directly to the heart of one of the greatest of modern
problems It does not palter or beat about the bush It asks right out
plump and plain Ann how old are you

Year by year until we reached the dizzy height of the Sixth Reader
were presented to us samples of the best English ever written If you
can find up in the garret a worn and frayed old Reader take it
down and turn its pages over See if anything in these degenerate days
compares in vital strength and beauty with the story of the boy that
climbed the Natural Bridge carving his steps in the soft limestone with
his pocket knife You cannot read it without a thrill The same inspired
hand wrote The Blind Preacher and who that ever can read it can
forget the climax reached in that sublime line Socrates died like a
philosopher but Jesus Christ like a god

Not long ago I walked among the graves in that spot opposite where Wall
Street slants away from Broadway and my feet trod on ground worth in
the market more than the twentydollar gold pieces that would cover
it My eye lighted upon a flaking brownstone slab that told me Captain
Michael Cresap rested there Captain Michael Cresap The intervening
years all fled away before me and once again my boyish heart thrilled
with that incomparable oration in McGuffeys Reader Who is there
to mourn for Logan Not one Captain Cresap was the man that led the
massacre of Logans family

And there was more than good literature in those Readers There was one
piece that told about a little boy alone upon a country road at
night The black trees groaned and waved their skinny arms at him
The windtorn clouds fitfully let a pale and watery moonlight stream
a little through It was very lonely Over his shoulder the boy saw
indistinct shapes that followed after and hid themselves whenever he
looked squarely at them Then suddenly he saw before him in the gloom
a gaunt white specter waiting for himwaiting to get him its arms
spread wide out in menace He was of our breed though this boy He did
not turn and run With God knows what terror knocking at his ribs he
trudged ahead to meet his fate and lo the grisly specter proved to be
a friendly guidepost to show the way that he should walk in Brother
for you are my kin that went with me to public school in the life
that you have lived since you first read the story of Harry and the
Guidepost has it been an idle tale or have you too found that what
we dreaded most what seemed to us so terrible in the future has after
all been a friendly guidepost showing us the way that we should walk
in

McGuffey had a Speller too It began with simple words in common use
like ab ab and eb eb and ib ib proceeding by gradual if not by
easy stages to honorificatudinibility and disproportionableness with
a department at the back devoted to twisters like phthisic and
mulleinstalk and diphtheria and gneiss We used to have a fine old
sport on Friday afternoons called chooseupandspelldown I dont
know if you ever played it It was a survival pure and simple from the
Old Red Schoolhouse There was where it really lived There was
where it flourished as a gladiatorial spectacle The crack spellers of
District Number 34 would challenge the crack spellers of the Sinking
Spring School The whole countryside came to the schoolhouse in wagons
at early candlelighting time and watched them fight it out The
interest grew as the contest narrowed down until at last there were the
two captains leftbig John Rice for District Number 34 and that wiry
nervous blackhaired girl of Lias Hoovers Polly Ann She married
a man by the name of Brubaker I guess you didnt know him His folks
moved here from Clarke County Polly Anns eyes glittered like a
snakes and she kept putting her knuckles up to the red spots in her
cheeks that burned like fire Old John he didnt seem to care a cent
And what do you think Polly Ann missed on Feoffment A simple little
word like feoffment She hadnt got further than pheph when she
knew that she was wrong but Teacher had said Next and big John took
it and spelled it right She had a fit of nervous crying and some were
for giving her the victory after all because she was a lady But big
John said She missed didnt she Well And I spelled it right didnt
I Well She took her chances same as the rest of us Taint me you got
to consider its District Number 34 And furthermore AND FURTHERMORE
Next time somebuddy asts her to go home with him from singinschool
mebby she wont snigger right in his face and say No s loud at
everybuddy kin hear it

Its quite a thing to be a good speller but there are people who can
spell any word that ever was and yet if you should ask them right quick
how much is seven times eight theyd hem and haw and say Seven tums
eight Whyah lemme see now Seven tumswhat was it you said Oh
seven tums eight Whyah seven tums eight is sixtythreefiftysix I
mean Theres nothing really to spelling Its just an idiosyncrasy
If there was really anything useful in it you could do it by
machineryjust the same as you can add by machinery or write with a
typewriter or play the piano with one of these things with cut paper
in it Spelling is an oldfashioned handpowered process and as such
doomed to disappear with the march of improvement

One Friday afternoon we chose up and spelled down and the next Friday
afternoon we spoke pieces Doubtless this accounts for our being a
nation of orators I am far from implying or seeming to imply that this
is anything to brag of Anybody that can be influenced by a man with a
big mouth a loud voice and a rush of words to the facewell Ive got
my opinion of all such

Oratory and poetryall foolishness I say Better far are
drawinglessons and raffiawork and claymodeling than I come not
here to talk and A soldier of the Legion lay dying at Algiers and
Old Ironsides at anchor lay I observe that these lines are more or
less familiar to you and that you are eager to add selections to the
list all of them known to me as well as you That children especially
boys loathe to speak a piece is a fact profoundly significant They
know it is nothing in the world but foolishness and if there is one
thing above another that a child hates it is to be made a fool in
public Thats what makes them work their fingers so and gulp and
stammer and tremble at the knees That is what sends them to their
seats after all is over mad as hornets This is something that I know
about It happened that instead of getting funny pieces to recite as I
wanted to discerning that one silly turn deserves another my parents
wellmeaning in their way taught me solemn things about O man
immortal live for something and all such and I had to humiliate
myself by disgorging them in public The consequence was that not only
on Friday afternoons but whenever anybody came to visit the school I
was butchered to make a Roman holiday Teacher was so proud of me and
the visitors let on that they were tickled half to death but I knew
better I could see the other scholars look at one another as much
as to say Well if youll tell me why Even in my shame and anger
I could see that But there is one happy memory of a Friday afternoon
Determined to show my friends and fellowcitizens that I too was born
in Arcadia and was a living human boy I announced to Teacher I got
another piece

Oh have you cried she sure of an extra Omanimmortal intellectual
treat Let us hear it by all means

Whereupon I marched up to the platform and declaimed that deathless
lyric

When I was a boy I was a bold one My mammy made me a new shirt out o
dads old one

All of it Certainly Isnt that enough That was the only distinctly
popular platform effort I ever made I am proud of it now I was proud
of it then But the news of my triumph was coldly received at home

I dont know whether it has since gone out of date but in my day
and time a very telling feature of school exhibitions was reading in
concert The room was packed as full of everybodys ma as it could be
and yet not mash the children out of shape and a whole lot of young
ones would read a piece together Fine Finest thing you ever heard I
remember one time teacher must have calculated a leetle mite too close
or else one girl more was in the class than she had reckoned on but on
the day the two end girls just managed to stand upon the platform and
that was all They recited together

 There was a sound of revelry by night
 And Belgiums capital

I forget the rest of it Well anyhow they were supposed to make
gestures all together Teacher had rehearsed the gestures and they all
did it simultaneously just as if they had been wound up with a spring
But as I said the two end girls had all they could do to keep on the
platform and it takes elbow room for T is but the car rattling
over the stony street and one girlwell she said she stepped off on
purpose but I didnt believe her then and I dont now We had our laugh
about it whichever way it was

We had our laugh Ah life was all laughter then That was before
care came to be the shadow at our heel That was before black Sorrow
met us in the way and would not let us pass unless we gave to her our
dearest treasure That was before we learned that what we covet most
is when we get it but a poor thing after all that whatsoever chalice
Fortune presses to our lips a tear is in the bottom of the cup In
those happy days gone by if the rain fell t was only for a little
while and presently the sky was bright again and the birds whistled
merrily among the wet and shining leaves Now the clouds return after
the rain

It can never be with us again as once it was For us the bell upon the
Old Red Schoolhouse calls in vain We heed it not we that
hearkened for it years ago The living tide of youth flows toward the
schoolhouse and we are not of it Never again shall we sit at those
old desks whittled and carved with rude initials and snap our fingers
eager to tell the answer Never again shall we experience the thrill of
pride when teacher praised us openly Never again shall we sit trembling
while the principal reads the note and then scowls at us fiercely
with Take off your coat sir Ah me Never again never again

Well who wants it to be that way again Were men and women now Weve
duties and responsibilities Who wants to be a child again Not I Let
me stick just at my present age for about a hundred years and Ill
never utter a word of complaint




THE SABBATHSCHOOL


 Wea love the Sundayschool

 SchoolWe all love the Sundayschool


 SPARKLING DEWDROPS


Some people believe that when General Conference assigned them to the
Committee on HymnBook Revision power and authority were given unto
them to put a halfsole and a new heel on any and all poetry that might
look to them to be a little run over on one side If they felt as I
do about the lines that head this article they would have Sunday
scratched out and Sabbath written in before you could bat an eye The
mere substitution of one word for another may seem a light matter to a
man that has never composed anything more literary than an obituary for
the Western Advocate of Sister Jane Malinda Sprague who was born in
Westmoreland County Pennsylvania in 1816 removed with her parents at
a tender age to New Sardis Washington County Ohio where etc etc
If he wanted to extract a word he would do it and never even offer to
give the author gas But I know just how it hurts I know or can imagine
how the gifted poet that penned the deathless lines I have quoted must
have walked the floor in an agony until every word and syllable was
just to suit him and so though I feel sure he meant to write
Sabbathschool I dont dare change it

To most persons one word seems about as good as another Sunday or
Sabbath but when there are young people about the house you learn to be
careful how you talk before them Now I would not go so far as to say
that Sunday is what you might call exactly rowdy but er but
er Let me illustrate If a man says Its a beautiful Sunday
morning like enough he has on redandgreen stockings baggy
knickerbockers a violetandpurple sweater a cap shaped like a
milkroll and is smoking a pipe He very likely carries a bagful of
golfsticks or is pumping up his bicycle But if a man says This
beautiful Sabbath morn you know for a certainty that he wears a
longtailed black coat a boiled shirt and a white tie He is bald from
his forehead upward his upper lip is shaven and his views and those
of the late Robert Reed on the disgusting habit of using tobacco are
absolutely at one

Not alone a regard for respectability but the hankering to be
historically accurate urges me to make the change I speak of
Originally the institution was a Sundayschool and not very respectable
either I should hate to think any of my dear young friends were in the
habit of attending such a lowclass affair as Robert Raikes conducted
Sundayschools were for little ragamuffins as he called them who
worked such long hours on weekdays from five in the morning until nine
at night that if they were to learn the common branches at all it had
to be on a Sunday A ragged school was bad enough in itself putting
foolish notions into the heads of gutterbrats and making them
discontented and unhappy in their lot but to teach a ragged school
on Sunday was a little too much So Robert Raikes encountered the most
violent opposition although from that beginning dates popular education
in England

To be able to read is no Longer a sign that Pa can afford to do without
the young ones wages on a Saturday night and can even pay for
their schooling It is no longer a mark of wealth or even of hardwon
privilege but the common fate of all to know the three Rs and Sunday
is not now set apart for secular instruction So good and wholesome an
institution as the Sundayschool was not permitted to perish but was
changed to suit the environment It is now become the Sabbathschool for
the study of the Bible a Christian recrudescence of the synagogue
For some eighteen centuries it was supposed that a regularly ordained
minister should have exclusive charge of this work At rare intervals
nowadays a clergyman may be found to maintain that because a man has
been to college and to the theological seminary and has made the study
of the Scriptures his lifework moved to that decision after careful
selfexamination that therefore he is better fitted to that ministry
than Miss Susie Goldrick who teaches a class in Sabbathschool very
acceptably Miss Goldrick is in the second year in the High School and
last Friday afternoon read a composition on English Literatoor in which
she spoke in terms of high praise of John Bunion the wellknown author
of Progress and Poverty Miss Goldrick is very conscientious
and always keeps her thumbnail against the questions printed on the
lessonleaf so as not to ask twice What did the disciples then do

It were a grave error to suppose that no secular learning is acquired in
the modern Sabbathschool I remember once when quite young speaking
to my teacher in the interval between the regular class work and the
closing exercises about peacocks I had read of them but had never
seen one What did they look like She said a peacock was something like
a butterfly I have always remembered that and when I did finally see
a peacock I was interested to note the essential accuracy of the
description

Also one day a new lady taught our class Miss Evans having gone up to
Marion to spend a Sunday with her brother who kept a stove store there
and this new lady borrowed two flower vases from off the pulpit and a
piece of string from Turkeyegg McLaughlin to explain to us boys how the
earth went around the sun We had too much manners to tell her that we
knew that years and years ago when we were in Miss Humphreyss room I
dont remember what the earth going around the sun had to do with the
lesson for the day which was about Samuel anointing Davids head with
oildid I ever tell you how I anointed my own head with coal oilbut
I do remember that she broke both the vases and cut her finger and had
to keep sucking it the rest of the time because she didnt want to get
her handkerchief all bloodied up It was a kind of fancy handkerchief
made of thin stuff trimmed with laceno good

The Sabbathschool may be said to be divided into three courses namely
the preparatory or infantclass the collegiate or Sabbathschool
proper and the postgraduate or Mr Parkers Bibleclass

What can a mere babe of three or four years learn in Sabbathschool
sneers the critic Not much I grant you of justification by Faith or
Effectual Calling but certain elementary precepts can be impressed
upon the mind while it is still in a plastic condition that never can
be wholly obliterated come what may in after life Prime among these
elementary precepts is this Always bring a penny

Some one has said Give me the first seven years of a childs life
and I care not who has the remainder I cannot endorse this without
reserve but I maintain as a demonstrated fact Bring up a child to
contribute a copper cent and when he is old he will not depart from
it It was recently my high privilege to attend a summer gathering
of representative religious people in the largest auditorium in this
country Sometimes under that farspreading roof ten thousand souls were
assembled and met together This fact could be guessed at with tolerable
accuracy from the known seating capacity but the interesting thing was
that it could be predicated with mathematical certainty that exactly ten
thousand people were present because the offertory footed up
exactly one hundred dollars What an encouragement to these faithful
infantclass teachers that have labored unremittingly instant in season
and out of season saying over and over again with infinite patience
Always bring a penny to know that their labor has not been in vain
and that as a people we have made it the rule of our lives always to
bring a pennyand no more

I have often tried to think what a Sabbathschool must be like in
California where they have no pennies It seems hardly possible that
the institution can exist under such a patent disability and yet it
does Do they work it on the same principle as the postoffice in
that faroff land where you cannot buy one postal card because the
postmaster cannot make change but must buy five postal cards or
two twocent stamps and a postal In other words does a nickel the
smallest extant coin serve for five persons for one Sunday or one
person for five Sundays I have often wondered about this

Subsidiary instruction in the preparatory course consists of sitting
right still and being nice keeping your fingers out of Johnny Pyms
eye because it hurts him and makes him cry not grabbing in the basket
when it goes by even though it does have pennies in it coaching in a
repertory of songs like Beautiful Beautiful Little Hands You in
Your Little Corner and I in Mine The Consecrated CrossEyed Bear
Pass Around the WashRagthe grown folks call that Pass Along the
Watchword and stories about David and Goliath Samson and the three
hundred foxes with fire tied to their tails Moses in the bulrushes the
infant Samuel Hagar in the wilderness and so forth The clergy have
often objected that these stories being told at the same period of life
with those about Santa Claus One time there was a little boy and he
had a dog named Rover the little girl that had hair as black as ebony
skin as white as snow and cheeks as red as blood because her Ma
who was a queen by occupation happened to cut her finger with a
blackhandled knife along about New Yearsthe clergy I say have
often objected that all these matters being brought to a childs
attention at the same period in its life are likely to be regarded in
after years as of equal evidential value I am not much of a hand to
argue myself but I should like to have one of these carping critics
meet my friend Mrs Sarah M Boggs who has taught the infantclass
since 1867 having missed only two Sundays in that time once in 1879
when it stormed so that nobody in town was out and once last winter a
year ago when she slipped off the back porch and hurt her knee I can
just see Sister Boggs laying down the law to anybody that finds fault
with the infantclass let him be preacher or who Why the very idea
Do you mean to say sirI guess Sister Boggs can straighten him out all
right

No less faithful is Mr Parker the leading lawyer of the town who
conducts the Bibleclass I believe one morning he didnt get there
until after the last bell was done ringing but otherwise his record of
attendance compares favorably with Sister Boggss Both teachers agree
to ignore the stated lesson for the day but whereas Sister Boggs leads
her flock through the flowery meads of narration Mr Parker and his
class have camped out by preference for the last forty years in the
arid wilderness of Romans and Hebrews and Corinthians First and Second
flinging the plentiful dornicks of Paul says this and Paul says that
at each others heads in friendly strife Mr Parkers class is also
very assiduous in its attendance upon the Young Peoples meetings
seemingly holding the dogma Once a young person always a young
person The prevailing style of hairdressing among the members is to
grow the locks long on the left side of the head and to bring the thin
layer across to the right pasted down very carefully with a sort of
peeled onion effect

There is a whole lot of them and they jower away at each other all
through the time between the opening and the closing exercises having
the liveliest kind of a time getting over about two verses of the Bible
and the whole ground of speculative theology

Immeasurably more impermanent in method and personnel is the regular
collegiate department the Sabbathschool proper In the early days
away back when sugar was sixteen cents a pound the thing to do was
to learn Scripture verses by heart If you were a rude rough boy who
didnt exactly love the Sundayschool as much as the hymn made you say
you did but still one who had rather sing it than stir up a muss you
hunted for the shortest verses you could find and said them off From
four to eight was considered a full days work But if you were a boy
who put on an apron and helped your Ma with the dishes a boy who always
wiped your feet before you came in a boy that never got kept in at
school a boy that cried pretty easy a nice pale boy with bulging
blue eyes you came to Sabbathschool and disgorged verses like
buckshot out of a bag The fourtoeightverse boys sat and listened
and improved their minds There was generally one other boy like you
in the class and it was nipandtuck between you which should get the
prize until finally you came one Sunday all bloated up with 238 verses
in your craw and he quit discouraged The prize was yours It was a
beautiful little Bible with a brass clasp it had two tiny silk strings
of an oldgold color for bookmarks and gilt edges all around that made
the leaves stick together at first It was printed in diamond type so
small it made your ears ring when you tried to read it

Other faculties than that of memory were called into action in those
days by problems like these Who was the meekest man Who was the
strongest man Who was the father of Zebedees children Who had the
iron bedstead and whose thumbs and greattoes were cut off To set a
child to find these things in the Bible without a concordance seems
to us as futile as setting him to hunt a needle in a haystack But our
fathers were not so foolish as we like to think them they didnt care
two pins if we never discovered who had the iron bedstead but they
knew that leafing over the book we should light upon treasure where
we sought it not kernels of the sweetest meat in the hardest shells
stories of enthralling interest where we least expected them but most
of all and best of all texts that long afterward in time of trouble
should come to us as it were the voice of one that also had eaten the
bread of affliction calling to us across the chasm of the centuries
and saying O tarry thou the Lords leisure be strong and He shall
comfort thine heart

In the higher classes that still were not high enough to rank with Mr
Parkers the exegetical powers were stimulated in this wise And they
sung a hymn and went out Now what do you understand by that We told
what we understood and what we held and what we believed and
laid traps for the teacher and tried to corner him with irrelevant
texts wrenched from their context He had to be an able man and a
nimblewitted man Mere piety might shine in the prayermeeting in the
classroom at the quarterly lovefeast but not in the Sabbathschool
I remember once when Brother Butler was away they set John Snyder to
teach us John didnt know any more than the law allowed and we made
him feel it until finally badgered beyond endurance he blurted out
that all he knew was that he was a sinner saved by grace Maybe he
couldnt just tell where to find this that and t other thing in the
Bible but he could turn right to the place where it said that though
a bodys sins were as scarlet yet they should be white as snow It was
regarded as a very poor sort of an excuse then but thinking it over
here lately it has seemed to me that maybe John had the root of the
matter in him after all

The comparative scarcity of polemical athletes and the relative plenty
of the Miss Susie Goldrick kind of teachers apparently called into
being the Berean Lesson Leaf system with its Bible cut up into
ladybites of ten or twelve verses its Golden Topics Golden Texts its
apt alliterations like

 S AMUEL
 EEKS
 AUL
 ORROWING

and its questions prepared in tabloid form suitable for the most
enfeebled digestions see directions printed on inside wrapper Among
the many evidences of the degeneracy of the age is the scandalous
ignorance of our young people regarding the sacred Scriptures which
at the very lowest estimate are incontestably the finest English ever
written Those whose childhood antedates the lesson leaf are not so
unfamiliar with that wondrous treasurehouse of thought It is not for
me to say what has wrought the change I can only point out that lesson
leaves being about the right size for shaving papers barely last from
Sunday to Sunday while that very identical Bible with the blinding type
that I won years and years ago by learning verses is with me still
Yes and as I often wonder to discover some of those very verses that I
gobbled down as heedlessly as any ostrich are with me still

Remain to be considered the opening and closing exercises principally
devoted I remember to learning new tunes and singing old ones out of
books with pretty titles like Golden Censer Silver Spray Pearl
and Gold Sparkling Dewdrops and Sabbath Chimes I wasnt going to
tell it but I might as well I suppose I can remember as far back as
Musical Leaves There must be quite a lot of people scattered about
the country who sung out of that when they were little I wish a few of
us old codgers might get together some time and with many a hummed and
prefatory Do mi Sol do Sol mi miiii finally manage to
quaver out the sweet old tunes we learned when we were little tads each
with a penny in his fat warm hand Shall we Gather at the River
and Work for the Night is Coming and what was the name of that one
about

 The waves shall come and the rolling thunder shock
 Shall beat upon the house that is founded on a rock
 And it never shall fall never never never

What the proper English tune is to I think when I read that sweet story
of old I cannot tell but I am sure it can never melt my heart as that
one in the old Musical Leaves with its twistful repetitions of the
last line

 I should like to have been with Him then
 I should like to have been with Him then
 When He took little children like lambs to His fold
 I should like to have been with Him then

I fear we could not sing that without breaking down As we recall it we
draw an inward fluttering breath something grips our throats and makes
them ache our eyes blur and a tear slips down upon the cheek not of
sorrowGod knows not all of sorrowbut if we had it all to live over
again how differently weoh well its too late now but still

Leafing over my little girls Arabian Nights the other day when I
came to the story of The Enchanted Horse I found myself humming
Land ahead Its fruits are waving My father used to lead the singing
in Sabbathschool and when he was solfaing that tune to learn it I
was devouring that story and was just about at the picture where Prince
Whatshisname rises up into the air on the Enchanted Horse with his
true love hanging on behind and all the multitude below holding their
turbans on as they look up and exclaim Well if that dont beat the
Dutch

And another tune still excites in me the sullen resentment that it
did when I first heard it In those days just as a fellow got to the
exciting part in Frank at Don Carloss Ranch or whatever the book
was there was kindling to be split or an armful of wood to be brought
in or a pitcher of water from the well or run over to Mrs Boggss
and ask her if she wont please lend me her flutingiron or run down
to Galbraiths and get me a spool of white thread Number 60 and hurry
right back because then I want you to go over to Serepta Downeys
and take her that polonaise pattern she asked me to cut out for her
orthere was always something on hand So what should one of these
composers doI dont know what ever possessed the manbut go write a
Sabbathschool song with this chorus

 Therell be something to do
 Therell be something to do
 Therell be something for children to do
 On that bright shining shore
 Where theres joy evermore
 Therell be something for children to do

I suppose he thought that would be an inducement

One of these days America is going to be the musical center of the
world When that day is fully come and men sit down to write about it
I hope they wont forget to give due credit to the reed organ Stephen
Foster and the Sabbathschool The reed organ had a lot to do with
musical culture It is much decried now by people that prefer a piano
that hasnt been tuned for four years but the reed organ will come into
its own some day dont forget Without it the Sabbathschool could not
have been Anybody that would have a piano in a Sabbathschool ought to

When music heavenly maid was just coming to after that awful lick the
Puritans hit her the first sign of returning life was that people began
to tire of the ten or a dozen tunes to which our greatgrandfathers
droned and snuffled all their hymns In those days there was raised up a
man named Stephen Foster who heard in his soul the music of wonderful
melodies and we have been singing them ever sinceWay Down upon
the Swanee Ribber and Old Kentucky Home and Nellie Gray and the
rest Then Bradbury and Philip Phillips and many more of them began to
write exactly the same kind of tunes for sacred words They were just
the thing for the Sabbathschool but they were more much more

You know that when a fellow gets so he can shave himself without cutting
half his lip off when it takes him half an hour to get the part in his
hair to suit him when he gets in the way of shining his shoes and has
a pretty taste in neckties he doesnt want to bawl the air of a piece
like the old stickinthemuds up in the Amen corner or in Mr Parkers
class He wants to sing bass Air is too high for him anyhow unless he
sings it with a hog noise Oh you get out You do too know what a
hog noise is You want to let on youve always lived in town Likely
story if you never heard anybody in the hogpasture with a basket of
nubbins calling Peeg Peeg Booeel Booee A mans voice breaks into
falsetto on the Booee Well anyhow such a young man as I am telling
you of would be ashamed to sing with a hog noise He wants to sing bass
Now the regular hymntunes change the bass as often as they change the
soprano and if you go fumbling about for the note by the time you get
it right it is wrong because the tune has gone on and left you The
Sabbathschool songs had the young man Absalom distinctly in view They
made the bass the same all through the measure and all the changes were
strictly on the do sol and fa basis As far as the other notes in the
scale were concerned the young man Absalom need not bother his head
with them With do sol and fa he could sing through the whole book from
cover to cover as good as anybody

When people find out what fun it is to sing by note it is only a step
to the Messiah two blocks up and turn to the right as you might say
After that it is only going ahead till you get to Vogner Yes and
manys the day you called the hogs Dont tell me

Once a month on Sunday evenings there were Sabbathschool concerts
The young ones sat in the front seats ten or twelve in a pew Now
children said the superintendent I want you all to sing loud
and show the folks how nice you can sing Page 65 Sixtyfith page
Scatter Seeds of Kindness Now all sing out now We licked our
thumbs and scuffled through the book till we found the place We scowled
at it and stuck out our mouths at it and shrieked at it and bawled
at it and did the very best we knew to give an imitation of two hundred
little pigs all grabbed by the hind leg at once That was what made
folks call it a concert

There were addresses to the dear children by persons that teetered on
their toes and dimpled their cheeks in driedapple smiles as us Some
complain that they do not know how to talk to children and keep them
interested Oh pshaw Simple as A B C Once you learn the trick you can
talk to the little folks for an hour and a half on Banking as Related
to National Finance and keep them on the quiver of excitement Ask
questions And to be sure that they give the right answers a very
important thing remember this When you wish them to say Yes sir
end your question with Dont they or isnt it When you wish them
to say No sir end your question with Do they or Is it When
you wish them to choose between two answers mention first the one they
mustnt take then pause look archly at them and mention the one they
must take Thus

Q Now dear children I wonder if you can tell me where the sun
rises In the north doesnt it

A Yes sir

Q Yes you are right In the north And because it rises in the north
every afternoon at three how do we walk about On our feet do we

A No sir

Q No Of course not Then how is it we do walk about On our ears
ornow the look on our noses

A On our noses

This method if carefully and systematically employed was never known
to fail It is called the Socratic method

The most interesting feature of the monthly Sabbathschool concert is
universally conceded to be the treasurers report So much on hand at
the last meeting so much contributed by each class during the month
last past so much expended so much left on hand at present We used
to sit and listen to it with slack jaws and staring eyes Money money
oceans of money Thirtyeight cents and seventysix cents and a dollar
four cents My

The librarians report was nowhere It was a bully library too and
contained the Through by Daylight Series and the Ragged Dick
Series and the Tattered Tom Series and the Frank on the Gunboat
Series and the Frank the Young Naturalist Series and the Elm
Island SeriesDid you ever read The Ark of Elm Island and Giant
Ben of Elm Island You didnt Ah you missed itand the B O W C
Seriesand say there was a book in that libraryoooo Cast up
by the Sea all about wreckers and false lights on the shore and
adventures in Central Africa and theres a nigger queen that wants to
marry him and he dont want to because he loves a girl in EnglandI
think thats kind of softand he kills about a million of them trying
to get away You want to get that book Dont let them give you Patient
Henry or Charlie Watson the Drunkards Little Son Theyre about
boys that take sick and dieno good

It was a bully library but the report wasnt interesting Major
Humphreyss always was He was the treasurer because he worked in the
bank He came from the Western Reserve and said cut when he meant
coat and hahnt when he meant heart I can shut my eyes and hear
him read his report now Infantclass Mrs Sarah M Boggs one
dolla thuttyeight cents Miss Danellss class fawtysix cents Miss
Goldricks class twentyfaw cents Mr Pahnkers class ninetythree
cents Miss Ruts class naw repawt

Poor old Miss Root There was hardly ever any report from her class
Often she hadnt a penny to give and perhaps the other old ladies who
found the keenest possible delight in doing what they called running up
the references had no more for they were relics of an age when women
werent supposed to have money to fling right and left in the foolish
way that women will if theyre not looked aftershoes for the baby and
a new calico dress every two or three years or so

Yes it is rather interesting for a change now and then to hear these
folks go on about what a terrible thing the Sabbathschool is and how
it does more harm than good They get really excited about it and storm
around as if they expected folks to take them seriously They know just
as well as we do that this wouldnt be any kind of a country at all if
we couldnt look back and remember the Sabbathschool or if we couldnt
fix up the children Sunday afternoons and find their lesson leaves for
them and hunt up a penny to give to the poor heathen and hear them say
the Golden Text before they go and tell them to be nice Papa and mamma
watch them from the window till they turn the corner and then go back
to the Sunday paper with a secure sort of feeling They wont learn
anything they oughtnt to at the Sabbathschool




THE REVOLVING YEAR


 It snows cries the schoolboy Hurrah
 And his shout is heard through parlor and hall


 MCGUFFEYs THIRD READER


Well maybe it was the Second Reader And if it was the Fourth what
difference does it make And furthermore who s doing this thing you
or me


Had it not been that never in my life have I ever heard anybody say
either It snows or Hurrah it is improbable that I should have
remembered the first line of a poem describing the effect produced upon
different kinds of people by the sight of the first snowstorm of winter
Had it not been for the plucky not to say heroic effort to rhyme
hall with hurrah I should not have remembered the second and still
another line of it depicting the emotions of a poor widow with a large
family and a small woodpile is burned into my memory only by reason
of the shocking language it contains the more shocking in that it was
deliberately put forth to be read by innocentminded children Poor
Carrie Rinehart When she stood up to read that she got as red as a
beet and I believed her when she told me afterward that she thought she
would sink right through that floor Of course some had to snicker but
the most of us I am thankful to say were a credit to our bringing up
and never let on we heard it All the same it was a terrible thing to
have to speak right out loud before everybody If any of the boys let
alone the girls had said that because he felt like saying it he would
have been sent in to the principal and that night his daddy would have
given him another licking

Even now I cannot bring myself to write the line without toning it down

It snows cries the widow Oh Gd

At the beginning of winter I will not deny that the schoolboy might
have shouted Its snowin Hooee when he saw the first snow flakes
sifting down and realized that the Old Woman was picking her geese
A change is always exciting and winter brings many joyous sports
and pastimes skating and snowballing and sliding down hill
andererI said skating didnt I anderOh yes sleighriding
anderWell I guess thats about all

Skating now thats fine I know a boy who when the red ball goes up
in the streetcars sneaks under his coat a pair of woodensoled skates
with runners that curl up over the toes like the stems of capital
letters in the Spencerian copybook He is ashamed of the oldfashioned
things which went out of date long and long before my day but he says
that they are better than the hockeys Well you take a pair of such
skates and strap them on tightly until you cant tell by the feel which
is feet and which is wooden soles and you glide out upon the ice above
the dam for say about four hours with the wind from the northwest and
the temperature about nine below and I tell you it is something grand
And if you run over a stick that is frozen in the ice or somebody bumps
into you or your feet slide out from under you and you strike on your
ear and part of your face on the ice and go about ten feet ah its
great Simply great And its nice too to skate into an airhole into
water about up to your neck and have the whole mob around you whooping
and hollering and slapping their legs with glee because they know it
isnt deep enough to drown you and you look so comical trying to claw
out And when you do get out it takes such along time to get your
skates of and you feel so kind of chilly like and when you get home
your clothes are frozen stiff on youOh who would willingly miss such
sport

And sleighriding Me for sleighriding You take a nice sharp day in
winter when the sky is as blue as can be because all the moisture is
frozen out of the air a day when the snow under the sleigh runners
whines and creaks as if thousands of tiny wineglasses were being
crushed by them and the bells go jingjing jingjing on the frosty
air which just about takes the hide off your face when you hold your
mittens up to your ears and then have to take them down to slap yourself
across the chest to get the blood agoing in your fingers when you kick
your feet together and dumbly wonder why it is your toes dont click
like marbles when the cold creeps up under your knitted pulsewarmers
and in at every possible little leak until it has soaked into your very
bones when you snuggle down under the laprobe where it is warm as
toast day before yesterdays toast and try to pull your shoulders up
over your head when a little drop hangs on the end of your nose
which has ceased to feel like a living human nose and now resembles
something whittled to a point when you hold your breath as long as
you can and your jaw waggles as if you were playing chinchopper with
itAh thats the sport of kings And after you have got as cold as you
possibly can get and simply cannot stand it a minute longer you ride
and ride and ride and ride and ride and ride and ride and ride and ride
Once in a while you turn out for another sleigh and nearly upset in the
process and you can see that in all points its occupants are exactly as
you are just as happy and contented There arent any dogs to run out
and bark at you Old Maje and Tige and even little Bounce and Guess
are snoozing behind the kitchen stove All there is is just jingjing
jingjing jingjing not a birdcry or a sound of living creature
jingjing jingjing Well yes kind o monotonous but still
You pass a house and a woman comes out to scrape off a plate to the
chickens standing on one foot in a corner where the sun can get at them
and the wind cannot She scrapes slowly and looks at you as much as to
say I wonder whos sick Must be somebody going for the doctor day
like this And then she shudders Bbboooooo and runs back into
the house and slams the door hard You snuffle and look at the chimney
that has thick white smoke coming out of it and consider that very
likely a nice warm fire is making all that smoke and you snuffle
again and ride and ride and ride and ride and ride and ride and ride
and ride And about an hour and a half after you have given up all
hopes and are getting resigned to your fate you turn off the big road
and up the lane to the house where you are going on your pleasuretrip
and you hop out as nimble as a sack of potatoes and hobble into the
house and dont say howdedo or anything but just make right for the
stove The people all squall out Why aint you most froze and
if you answer Yes sum its as much as ever Generally you cant do
anything but just stand and snuffle and look as if you hadnt a friend
on earth And about the time you get so that some spots are pretty warm
and other spots arent as cold as they were why then you wrap up and
go home again with the same experience only more so Fine fine

Its nice too when theres a whole crowd out together in a wagonbed
with straw in it Theres something so cozy in straw And the tin horns
you blow in each others ear and the songs you sing Jingle bells
jingle bells jingle all the way and Wawunneeta Wawunneeta ayusk
thy sowl if we shud part and Nearer my God to Thee and Johnny
Shmoker and that variation of John Browns Body where every time
you sing over the verse you leave off one more word and somebody always
forgets and you laugh fit to kill yourself and just have a grand time
And maybe you take a whole lot of canned cove oysters with you and when
you get out to Makemsons or wherever it is youre going Mrs Makemson
puts the kettle on and makes a stew cooking the oysters till they are
thoroughly done And she makes coffee the kind you cant tell from tea
by the looks and have to try twice before you can tell by the taste
Ah winter brings many joyous sports and pastimes And you get back home
along about halfpast two and the fires out and the folks are in bed
and you have to be at the store to open up at sevenLaws I wish it was
so I could go sleighriding once more in the long winter evenings
when the pitcher in the spare bedroom bursts and makes a noise like a
cannon

And sliding down hill I like that

What Coasting Never heard of it If its anything like sliding down
hill its all right For a joke you can take a barrelstave and hold on
to that and slide down It goes like a scared rabbit but that isnt
so much the point as that it slews around and spills you into a drift
Sleds are lower and narrower than they used to be and they also lack
the artistic adornment of a pink or a blue or a black horse painted
with the same stencil but in different colors and named Dexter or
Rarus or Goldsmith Maid These are good names but nobody ever
called his sled by a name Boggss hill back of the ladys house that
taught the infantclass in Sundayschool was a good hill It had a
creek at the bottom and a fine long ride eight or ten feet on the
ice But Danglers hill was the boss It was the one we all made up our
minds we would ride down some day when the snow was just right Wed
go over there and look up to the brow of the hill and say Gee But
wouldnt a fellow come down like sixty though

Betchy

Wed look up again and somebody would say Aw come on Less go over
to Boggss hill

Thought you was goin down Danglers

Yes I know but all the other fellows is over to Boggss

Aah yere afraid

Aint either

Y are teether

I dare you

Oh well now

I double dare you

All right I will if you will You go first

Nah you go first The fellow thats dared has got to go first Aint
that so Chuck Aint that so Monkey

Ill go down if you will ony you gotta go first

ErerWho all s over at Boggss hill

Oh the whole crowd of em Turkeyegg McLaughlin and Ducky
Harshberger andOh I don know who all

Tell you what less do Less wait till it gets all covered with ice and
all slick and smooth Then less come over and go down

Say wont she go like sixty then Jeemses Rivers Come on Ill beat
you to the corner

That was the closest we ever came to going down Danglers hill Railroad
hill wasnt so bad over there by the soapfactory because they didnt
run trains all the time and you stood a good chance of missing being
run over by the engine but Danglers Well now I want to tell you
Danglers was an awful steep hill and a long one and when you think
that it was so steep nobody ever pretended to drive up it even in the
summertime and you slide down the hill and think that once you got to
going

Funs fun I know but nobody wants to go home with half his scalp
hanging over one eye and dripping all over the back porch Because
you know a fellows mother gets crosser about blood on woodwork than
anything else Scrubbing doesnt do the least bit of good it has to be
planed off or else painted

Let me see now Have I missed anything Ill count em off on my
fingers Theres skating and sleighriding and sliding down hill and
Oh yes Snowballing and making snowmen Nobody makes a snowman but
once and nobody makes a snowhouse after it has caved in on him once
and like to killed him And as for snowballingLook here Do you know
whats the nicest thing about winter Get your feet on a hot stove
and have the lamp over your left shoulder and a pan of apples and
something exciting to read like Frank Among the Indians Eh how
about it In other words the best thing about winter is when you can
forget that it is winter

The excitement that prompts It snows and Hurrah mighty soon peters
out and along about the latter part of February when you go to the
window and see that it is snowing againagain Consarn the luckyou
and the poor widow with the large family and the small woodpile are
absolutely at one

You do get so sick and tired of winter School lets out at four oclock
and its almost dark then Theres no time for play for theres all
that wood and kindling to get in and Paps awful cranky when he hops
out of bed these frosty mornings to light the fire and finds youve
been skimpy with the kindling And the pump freezes up and youve got
to shovel snow off the walks and out in the backyard so Tilly can hang
up the clothes when she comes to do the washing And your mother is just
as particular about your neck being clean as she is in summer when
the water doesnt make you feel so shivery And theres the bottle
of goosegrease always handy and the red flannel to pin around your
throat and your feet in the bucket of hot water before you go to
bedAw put em right in Yes I know its hot Thats what going to
make you well In with em Aw child it isnt going to scald you Go
on now The waterll be stonecold in a minute Oh I dont like winter
for a cent Kitchoo There Ive gone and caught fresh cold

I wish it would hurry up and come spring

 When the days begin to lengthen
 The cold begins to strengthen

Now you know that doesnt stand to reason Every day the sun inches a
little higher in the heavens His rays strike us more directly and for a
longer time each day But its the cantankerous fact and it simply has
to stand to reason Thats the answer and the sum has to be figured out
somehow in accordance with it Like one time when I was about sixteen
years old and in the possession of positive and definite information
about the way the earth went around the sun and all I was arguing with
one of these old codgers that think they know it all one of these
men that think it is so smart to tell you Sonny when you get older
youll know more n you do nowI hope Well he was trying to tell me
that the day lengthened at one end before it did at the other I did my
best to dispel the foolish notion from his mind and explained to him
how it simply could not be but no sir he stood me down Finally
since pure reasoning was wasted on him I took the almanac off the nail
it hung by andI bedog my riggins if the old skidama link wasnt
right after all Sundown keeps coming a minute later every day while
for quite a while there sunup sticks at the same old time 730 AM
Did you ever hear of anything so foolish

Very early while it is yet dark the alarm clock of old Dame Nature
begins to buzz It may snow and blow and winter may seem to have
settled in in earnest but deep down in the earth the roottips where
lie the brains of vegetables are gaping and stretching and hohumming
and wishing they could snooze a little longer When it thaws in the
afternoon and freezes up at sunset as tight as bricks they tell me
that out in the sugarcamp there are great doings I dont know about
it myself but I have heard tell of boring a hole in the mapletree
and sticking in a spout and setting a bucket to catch the drip and
collecting the sap and boiling down and sugaring off I have heard
tell of taffypullings and how Joe Hendricks stuck a whole gob of
maplewax in Sally Millers hair and how she got even with him by
rubbing his face with soot It is only hearsay with me but Ill tell
you what I have done I have eaten real maple sugar and nearly pulled
out every tooth I had in my head with maplewax and I have even gone so
far as to have maple syrup on pancakes Its good too The maple syrup
came on the table in a sort of a glass flagon with a metal lid to it
and it was considered the height of bad manners to lick off the last
drop of syrup that hung on the nose of the flagon And yet it must not
be allowed to drip on the tablecloth It is a pity we cant get any
more maple syrup nowadays but I dont feel so bad about the loss of it
as I do to think what awful liars people can be declaring on the label
that deed and double pon their word and honor it is pure genuine
unadulterated maple syrup when they know just as well as they know
anything that it is only storesugar boiled up with maple chips

Along about the same time the boys come home with a ring of mud around
their mouths and exhaling spicy breaths like those which blow oer
Ceylons isle in the hymnbook They bear a bundle of roots whose
thick pink hide mother whittles off with the butcherknife and sets
to steep Put away the store tea and coffee Tonight as we drink the
reddish aromatic brew we return not only to our own young days but
to the young days of the nation when our folks moved to the West in a
covered wagon when grandpap only a little boy then about as big as
Charley there got down the rifle and killed the bear that had climbed
into the hogpen when they found old Cherry out in the timber with her
calf between her legs and two wolves lying where she had horned them
to deathwe return tonight to the high heroic days of old when our
forefathers conquered the wilderness and our foremothers reared the
families that peopled it This cup of sassafras tonight in their loving
memory Earth rest easy on their moldering bones

Some there be that still take stock in the groundhog I dont believe
he knows anything about it And I believe that any animal that had
the sense that he is reputed to have would not have remained a mere
groundhog all these years At least not in this country Anyhow its
a long ways ahead six weeks is especially at the time when you do wish
so fervently that it would come spring We keep on shoveling coal in the
furnace and carrying out ashes and longing and crying Oh for pitys
sakes When is this going to stop And then one morning we awaken
with a start Whawhat Sh Keep still cant you There is a more
canorous and hornlike quality to the crowing of Gildersleeves rooster
and his hens chant cheerily as they kick the litter about But it wasnt
these cheerful sounds that wakened us with a start There Hear that
Hear it Two or three longdrawn reedy notes and an awkward boggle at
a trill but oh how sweet How sweet It is the songsparrow blessed
bird It wont be long now it wont be long

The snow fort in the backyard still sulks there black and dirty Ill
go when I get good and ready and not before it seems to say Other
places the thinner snow has departed and left behind it mud that seizes
upon your overshoe with an Oh whats your rush In the middle of
the road it lies as smooth as pancakebatter A load of building stone
stalls and people gather on the sidewalk to tell the teamster quietly
and unostentatiously that he ought to have had more sense than to pile
it on like that with the roads the way they are Every time the cruel
whip comes down and the horses dance under it the women peering out of
the front windows wince and cluck Tchk Aint it terrible He ought
to be arrested This way and that the team turns and tugs but all in
vain Somebody puts on his rubber boots and wades out to help fearing
not the muddy spokes Yo hee Yo hee No use He talks it over with the
teamster You can hear him say Well suit yourself If you want to
stay here all night

And then the women exult Goody Goody Serves him right Now he has to
take off some of the stone Lazy mans load

The mother of children flies to the backdoor when school lets out
Dont you come in here with all that mud she squalls excitedly Look
at you A peck o dirt on each foot Right in my nice clean kitchen that
I just scrubbed Go long now and clean your shoes Go long I tell
you Slave and slave for you and thats all the thanks I get Youd
keep the place looking like a hogpen if I wasnt at you all the time I
never saw such young ones since the day I was made Never Whoopin and
hollerin and trackin in and out Its enough to drive a body crazy

Dont you care Its just her talk If it isnt one thing its another
cleaning your shoes or combing your hair or brushing your clothes or
using your handkerchief or shutting the door softly or holding your
spoon with your fingers and not in your fist or keeping your finger out
of your glass when you drinksomething the whole blessed time Forever
and eternally picking at a fellow about something And saying the same
thing over and over so many times Thats the worst of it

Pap and mother read over the seed catalogues all about warm light
soils and hardy annuals and sow in drills four inches apart It
kind of hurries things along when you do that In the south window of
the kitchen is a box full of black dirt in which will you look out what
youre doing Little more and youd have upset it There are tomato
seeds in that Ill have you know Oh yes government seeds Somebody
sends em I dont know who Congressman I guess whoever he is I
dont pretend to keep track of em And say When was this watered last
There it is Unless I stand over you every minuteMy land If theres
anything done about this house Ive got to do it

Between the days when it cant make up its mind whether to snow or to
rain and tries to do both at once comes a day when it is warm enough
almost to go without an overcoat The Sunday following you can hardly
hear what the preacher has to say for the whooping and barking The
choir members have cough drops in their cheeks when they stand up to
sing and everybody stops in at the drug store with Say Doc whats
good for a cold

Eggs have come down Yesterday they were nine for a quarter today
theyre ten Gildersleeve wants a dollar for a setting of eggs but
hell let you have the same number of eggs for thirty cents if youll
wait till he can run a needle into each one So afraid youll raise
chickens of your own

Excited groups gather about rude circles scratched in the mud and there
is talk of pureys and reals and aggies and commies and fen
dubs There is a rich click about the bulging pockets of the boys and
every so often in school time something drops on the floor and rolls
noisily across the room When Miss Daniels asks Who did that the
boys all look so astonished Who did what pray tell And when she picks
up a marble and inquires Whose is this nobody can possibly imagine
whose it might be least of all the boy whose most highlyprized shooter
it is At this season of the year too there is much serious talk as
to the exceeding sinfulness of playing for keeps The little boys in
whose thumbs lingers the weakness of the arboreal ape their ancestor
and who poke their marbles drink in eagerly the doctrine that when
you win a marble you ought to give it back but the hardeyed fellows
who can plunk it every time sit there and let it go in one ear and out
the other there being a hole drilled through expressly for the purpose
What Give up the rewards of skill Ah gwan

The girls even to those who have begun to turn their hair up under are
turning the rope and dismally chanting All in together pigs in the
meadow nineteen twenty leave the rope empty or whatever the rune is

It wont be long now It wont be long

 For lo the winter is past the rain is over and gone the
 flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds
 is come and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land the
 figtree putteth forth her green figs and the vines with the
 tender grape give a good smell Arise my love my fair one
 and come away


 THE SONG OF SOLOMON

Out in the woods the leaves that rustled so bravely when we shuffled
our feet through them last fall are sodden and matted It is warm in the
woods for the sun strikes down through the bare branches and the cold
wind is fended off The fleshy lances of the spring beauty have stabbed
upward through the mulch and a tiny cup delicately veined with pink
hangs its head bashfully Anemones on brown wire stems aspire without
a leaf and in moist patches are May pinks the trailing arbutus of the
grownups As we carry home a bunch the heads all lopping every way
like the heads of strangled babies we can almost hear behind us in the
echoing forests a long heartbroken moan as of Rachel mourning for
her children and will not be comforted because they are not The wild
flowers dont look so pretty in the tin cups of water as they did back
in the woods There is something cheap and common about them Throw em
out The poor plants that planned through all the ages how to attract
the first smart insects of the season and trick them into setting
the seeds for next years flowers did not reckon that these very means
whereby they hoped to rear a family would prove their undoing at the
hands of those who plume themselves a little on their refinement they
are so fond of flowers

Old Winter hates to give up that he is beaten Its a funny thing but
when you hear a person sing Goodaby Summer goodaby goodaby
you always feel kind of sad and sorry Its going the time of year when
you can stay out of doors most of the time when you can go in swimming
and the Sundayschool picnic and the circus and play baseball and
camp out and theres no school and everything nice and watermelons
and all like that Goodby goodby and you begin to sniff a little
The departure of summer is dignified and even splendid but the earth
looks so sordid and draggletrailed when winter goes that onions could
not bring a tear Old winter likes to tease Aha You thought I
was gone did you Not yet my child not yet And he sends us
huckleberrycolored clouds from the northwest from which snowflakes
big as copper cents solemnly waggle down as if they really expected
the schoolboy to shout It snows Hurrah and makes his shout heard
through parlor and hall But they only leave a few dark freckles on the
garden beds Alas yes There is no light without its shadow no joy
without its sorrow tagging after It isnt all marbles and play in the
gladsome springtide Bub has not only to spade up the gardenthere is
some sense in thatbut he has to dig up the flower beds and help his
mother set out her footy trifling plants

The robins have come back our robins that nest each spring in the old
seeknofurther To the boy grunting over the spadingfork presents
himself Cock Robin How about it Hey All right Hey he seems
to ask cocking his head and flipping out the curt inquiries
with tailjerks Glad of any excuse to stop work the boy stands
statuestill while Mr Robin drags from the upturned clods the long
elastic fishworms and then with a brief Chip flashes out of sight
Be right still now Dont move Here he comes again and his wife with
him They fly down he all eager and alert to wait upon her she whining
and scolding She doesnt think its much of a place for worms And
theres that boy yonder Hes up to some devilment or other she just
knows She oughtnt to have come away and left those eggs Theyll get
cold now she just knows they will Anything might happen to them when
she s away and then he ll be to blame for he coaxed her He knows
she told him she didnt want to come But he would have it For half a
cent shed go back right now And Heavens above Is he going to be all
day picking up a few little worms

She cannot finish her sentences for her gulps for he is tamping down
in her insides the reluctant angleworms that do not want to die two
or three writhing in his bill at once until he looks like Joves
eagle with its mouth full of thunderbolts And all the time he is
chipchipping and flirting his tail and saying Hows that All right
Hey Heres another Hows that All right Hey Open now Like that
Heres one Oh a beaut Heres two fat ones Great Hey Here y go
Touch the spot Hey More Sure Mike Lots of em Wide now Boss Hey
Wait a secondyes honey In a second I got him Heres the kind
you like Oh yes do Do take one more Oh you better

D ye think Im made o rubber she snaps at him I know Ill have
indigestion and youll be to blaMercy land Them eggs and she
gathers up her skirts and flits He escorts her gallantly but returns
to pick a few for himself and to cock his head knowingly at the boy
as much as to say Man of family by Ned Oror soon will be Oh yes
any minute now any minute

And if I remember rightly he even winks at the boy with a wink whose
full significance the boy does not learn till many years after when
it dawns upon him that it meant You got to make allowances for em
Especially at such a time All upset you know and worried Oh yes
You got to you got to make allowances for em

Day by day the air grows balmier and softer on the cheek Out in the
garden ranks of yellowgreen pikes stand stiffly at Present
Hump and rosettes of the same color crumple through the warm soil
unconsciously preparing for a soul tragedy For an evening will come
when a covered dish will be upon the suppertable and when the cover is
taken off a subtle fragrance will betray if the sense of sight do not
that the choppedup lettuces and onions are in a marsh of cider vinegar
demanding to be eaten And your big sister will squall out in comic
distress Oh ma You are too mean for anything Why did you have em
tonight I told you Mr Dellabaugh was going to call and you know how I
love spring onions Well I dont care Im just going to anyhow

Things come with such a rush now it is hard to tell what happens in
its proper order The appletrees blossom out like popcorn over the hot
coals The Japan quince repeats its farfamed imitation of the Burning
Bush of Moses the flowering currants are strung with knobs of vivid
yellow fringe the dead grass from the front yard the sticks and stalks
and old tomato vines the bits of rag and the old bones that Guess has
gnawed upon are burning in the alley and the tormented smoke is darting
this way and that trying to get out from under the wind that seeks to
flatten it to the ground All this is spring andand yet it isnt The
word is not yet spoken that sets us free to live the outdoor life we
are yet prisoners and captives of the house

But one day in school the heat that yesterday was nice and cozy
becomes too dry and baking for endurance The young ones come in from
recess red not with the brilliant glow of winter but a sort of scalded
red They juke their heads forward to escape their collars moist
embrace they reach their hands back of them to pull their clinging
winter underwear away They fan themselves with joggerfies and puff
out Phew and look pleadingly at the shut windows One boy bolder
than his fellows moans with a suffering lament Miss Daniels caint
we have the windows open Its awful hot Frightful dangers lurk in
draughts Fresh air will kill folks So not until the afternoon is the
prayer answered Then the outer world so long excluded enters once
more the schoolroom life The mellifluous crowing of distant roosters
the rhythmic creaking of a thirsty pump the rumble of a loaded wagon
the clinking of hammers at the blacksmith shop the whistle of No 3
away below town all blend together in the soft spring air into one
lulling harmony

Winters alert activity is gone Who cares for grades and standings now
The girls that always are so smart gape lazily and stare at vacancy
wishing They dont know what they wish but if He had a lot of
money why then they could help the poor and all like that and have a
new dress every day

James Sacketthis real name is Jim Bag but teacher calls him James
Sacketthas his face set toward A farmer sold 16 23 bu wheat for
66 78 c per bu 19 29 bu oats for etc etc but his soul is
far away in Cumminss woods where there is a robbers cave that he and
Chuck Higgins and Bunt Rogers and Turkeyegg McLaughlin are going
to dig Saturday afternoons when the chores are done They are going
toHere Miss Daniels should slip up behind him and snap his ear but
she too is far away in spirit Her beau is coming after supper to take
her buggyriding She wonders She wonders Will she have to teach
again next fall She wonders

Wait Wait but a moment A subtle change is coming

The rim of the revolving year has a brighter and a darker half a joyous
and a somber half Autumnal splendors cannot cheer the melancholy that
we feel when summer goes from us but when summer comes again the heart
leaps up in glee to meet it Wait but a moment now Wait

The distant woodland swims in an amethystine haze A long and fluting
note honeysweet as it were blown upon a bottle comes to us from far
It is the turtledove The blood beats in our ears Arise my love my
fair one and come away

So gentle it can scarce be felt a waft of air blows over us the first
sweet breath of summer A veil of faint and subtle perfume drifts around
us The vines with the tender grape give a good smell And evermore as
its enchantment is cast about us we are as once we were when first we
came beneath its spell we are by the smokehouse at the old home place
we stand in shoes whose copper toes wink and glitter in the sunlight
a gingham apron sways in the soft breeze and on the green upspringing
turf dances the shadow of a tasseled cap Life was all before us then
Please God it is not all behind us now Please God our best and wisest
days are yet to come the days when we shall do the work that is worthy
of us Dear one mother of my children here and Yonderand Yonderthe
best and wisest days are yet to come Arise my love my fair one and
come away




THE SWIMMINGHOLE


It is agreed by all I think that the two happiest periods in a mans
life are his boyhood and about ten years from now We are exactly in the
position described in the hymn

 Lo On a narrow neck of land
 Twixt two unbounded seas we stand
 And cast a wishful eye

 I am told on good authority that this last line of the
 three belongs to another hymn As it is just what I want to
 say Im going to let it stand as it is

If I remember right the hymn went to the tune of Ariel and I can see
John Snodgrass the precentor sneaking a furtive C from his pitchpipe
finding E flat and then sol and standing up to lead the singing
paddling the air gently with Down left sing Well no matter about
that now What I am trying to get at is that we have all a lost Eden
in the past and a Paradise Regained in the future Twixt two unbounded
seas of happiness we stand on the narrow and arid sandspit of the
present and cast a wishful eye In hot weather particularly the wishful
eye when directed toward the lost Eden of boyhood lights on and
lingers near the Old Swimminghole

I suppose boys do grow up into a reasonable enjoyment of their faculties
in big seaside cities and on inland farms where there is no accessible
body of water larger than a washtub but I prefer to believe that the
majority of our adult male population in youth went in swimming in the
river up above the dam where the big sycamore spread out its roots
apurpose for them to climb out on without muddying their feet Some I
suppose went in at the Copperas Banks below town where the current had
dug a hole that was over head and hands but that was pretty far and
almost too handy for the boys from across the tracks

The washtub fellows will have to be left out of it entirely It was an
inferior lowgrade Eden they had anyhow and if they lost it why they
re not out very much that I can see And I rather pity the boys that
lived by the sea They had a good time in their way I suppose
with sailboats and things but the ocean is a poor excuse for a
swimminghole They say saltwater is easier to swim in kind of bears
you up more Maybe so but I never could see it and even so if it
does that slight advantage is more than made up for by the manifold
disadvantages entailed First place theres the tide to figure on If
it was high tide last Wednesday at halfpast ten in the morning what
time will it be high tide today A boy cant always go when he wants to
and it is no fun to trudge away down to the beach only to find half a
mile of soft gawmy mud between him and the water And he cant go in
wherever it is deep enough and nobody lives near People own the beach
away out under water and where he is allowed to go in may be a perfect
submarine jungle of eelgrass or bottomed with millions of razoredged
barnacles that rip the soles of his feet into bleeding rags Then
too when one swims more or less water gets into ones nose and mouth
Riverwater may not be exactly what a fastidious person would choose
to drink habitually but there is this in its favor as compared with
seawater it will stay down after it is swallowed also it doesnt gum
up your hair also if you want to take a cake of soap with you all you
have to look out for is that you dont lose the soap Nobody tries to
use toilet soap in seawater more than once

And surfbathing If there is a bigger swindle than surfbathing the
United States Postal authorities havent heard of it yet It is all very
well for the women They can hang on to the ropes and squeal at the big
waves and have a perfectly lovely time Some of the really daring ones
crouch down till they actually get their shoulderblades wet You
have to see that for yourself to believe it but it is as true as I
am sitting here They do sosome of them But good land Theres no
swimming in surfbathing no fun for a man The water is all bouncing up
and down One second it is over head and hands and the next second it
is about to your knees with a malicious undertow tickling your feet and
tugging at your ankles and growling Aw you think youre some dont
you Yes Well for half a cent wouldnt take you out and drown you
And I dont like the looks of that boat patrolling up and down between
the ropes and the raft It is too suggestive too like the skeleton at
the banquet too blunt a reminder that maybe what the undertow growls is
not all a bluff

Another drawback to the ocean as a swimminghole is that the distances
are all wrong If you want to go to the other side of the crick
you must take a steamboat There is no such thing as bundling up your
clothes and holding them out of water with one hand while you swim with
the other perhaps dropping your knife or necktie in transit I have
never been on the other side of the crick even on a steamboat but
I am pretty sure that there are no yellowhammers nests over there or
watermelon patches There were above the dam At the seaside they give
you as an objective point a raft anchored at what seems only a little
distance from where it gets deep enough to swim in but which turns out
to be a mighty far ways when the water bounces so When you get there
blowing like a quarterhorse and weighing nine tons as you lift yourself
out there is nothing to do but let your feet hang over while you get
rested enough to swim back It wasnt like that above the dam

I tell you the ocean is altogether too big Some profess to admire it
on that account but it is my belief that they do it to be in style
I admit that on a bright blowy day when you can sit and watch the
shining sails far out on the horizons rim it does look right nice
but I account for it in this way it puts you in mind of some of these
expensive oil paintings and that makes you think it is kind of high
class And another thing It recalls the picture in the joggerfy that
proved the earth was round because the hull of a ship disappears before
the sails as it would if the ship was going over a hill You sweep your
eye along where the sky and water meet and it seems you can note the
curvature of the earth Maybe it is that and maybe it is all in your
own eye I am not saying

There are good points too about the sea on a clear night when the moon
is full or when there is no moon and the phosphorescence in the water
shows as if mermaids children were playing with bluetipped matches I
like to see it when a gale is blowing and the white caps race Yes and
when it is a flat calm with here and there a tiny catspaw crinkling
the water into graygreen crepe And also whenbut there it is no use
cataloguing all kinds of weather and all hours of the day and night
What I dont approve of in the ocean is its everlasting bigness It is
so discouraging It makes a body seem so noaccount and insignificant
You come away feeling meaner than a sheepkilling dog Oh whats the
use you say to yourself Whats the use of my breaking my neck to do
anything or be anybody Before I was bornbefore History beganbefore
any foot of being that could be called a man trod these sands the waves
beat thus the pulse of time When I am gonewhen all that man has made
that seems so firm and everlasting shall have crumbled into the earth
whence it sprang this wave so momentary and so eternal shall still
surge up the slanting beach and trail its lacy mantle in retreat O
spare me a little that I may recover my strength before I go hence and
be no more seen

And thats no way for a man to feel He ought to be confident and sure
of himself If he hasnt yet done all that he laid out to do he should
feel that it is in him to do it and that he will before the time comes
for him to go and that when it is done it shall be orth while

It is the oceans everlasting bigness that makes it so cold to swim in
At the seaside bathing pavilions they have a blackboard whereon they
chalk up 70 or 72 or whatever they think folks will like They never
say in so many words that a man went down into the water and held a
thermometer in it long enough to get the true temperature but they
lead you to believe it All I have to say is that they must have very
optimistic thermometers I just wish some of these poor little seashore
boys could have a chance to try the Old Swimminghole up above the dam
Certainly along about early goingbarefoot time the water is a little
cool but you take it in the middle of Augustah I tell you When you
come out of the water then you dont have to run up and down to get your
blood in circulation or pile the warm sand on yourself or hunt for the
steamroom Only thing is if you stay in all day as you want to it
thins your blood and you get the fever n ager But you can stay in
as long as you want to that s the point without your lips turning the
color of a chickens gizzard

And theres this about the Old Swimminghole or there was in my day
There were no women and girls fussing around aid squalling Now you
stop splashin water on me Quit it now Queeyut I dont think t
looks right for women folks to have anything to do with water in large
quantities On a sailboat now they are the verybut perhaps we had
better not go into that At a picnic indeed trey used to take off
their shoes and stockings and paddle their feet in the water but that
was as much as ever they did They never thought of going in swimming
Even at the seashore now when Woman is so emancipated they go bathing
not swimming I dont like to see a woman swim any more than I like to
see a woman smoke a cigar And for the same reason It is more fun
than she is entitled to A womans place is home minding the baby and
cooking the meals Nothing would do her but she had to be born a woman
she had the same liberty of choice that we men had Very well I say
let her take the consequencies

It is only natural then that she should refuse to let her boys go
swimming She pays off her grudge that way Just because she cant go
herself she is bound the they shant either She says they will get
drowned but we know about that It is only an excuse to keep them from
having a little fun She has to say something They wont get drowned
Why the idea They havent the least intention of any such thing

Well but Robbie supposing you couldnt help yourself

How couldnt help myself

Why get the cramps Suppose you got the cramps then what

Aw pshaw Cramps nothin They haint no sich of a thing And anyhow
if I did get em wouldnt jist kick em right out This way

Now Robbie you know you did have a terrible cramp in your foot just
only the other night Dont you remember

Aw that That aint nothin That aint the cramps that drownds
people Didnt I tell you wouldnt fist kick it right out Thats what
they all do when they git the cramps But they dont nobody git em now
no more

I dont want you to go in the water and get drowned You know you cant
swim

This is too much Oh this is rank injustice Worse yet it is bad
logic

How m I ever goin to learn if you dont let me go to learn

Well you cant go and thats the end of it

Isnt that just like a woman Perfectly unreasonable Dear dear

Now Ma listen here Sposin we was all goin some place on a
steamboat me and you and Pa and the baby and all of us and

That wont ever happen I guess

CANT YOU LET ME TELL YOU And sposin the boat was to sink and I
could swim and save you from drown

Youre not going swimming and thats all there is about it

Other boys mas lets them go I dont see why I cant go

No answer

Ma wont you let me go I wont get drowned hope to die if I do Ma
wont you let me go Ma MaaMawah

Stop yelling at me that way Good land Do you think Im deaf

Wont you let me go Please wont you let

No I wont I told you I wouldnt and I mean it You might as well
make up your mind to stay at home for yourenotgoing Hush up now
This instant sir Robbie do you hear me Stop crying Great baby
wouldnt be ashamed to cry that way as big as you are

Mean old Ma Guess shed cry toof she could see the other kids that
waited for him to go and ask herif she could see them moving off
tired of waiting Theyre most up to Lincoln Avenue

Oooooooooooohoohoohoohoohooooooooooah I wanna gowooooo

Did you hoe that corn your father told you to

Oooooooooooohoohoohoooooooooo I wanna gowooooooo

Robbie Did you hoe that corn

The last boy the one with the stonebruise on his heel limps around
the corner They have all the fun His ma wont let him go barefoot
because it spreads his feet

Robbie Answer me

Mam

Did you hoe that corn your father told you to

Yes mam

All of it Did you hoe all of it

Prett near all of it Well begun is half done One hill is a good
beginning and half done is pretty nearly all

Go and finish it

I will if youll let me go swimmin

It flashes upon him that even now by running he can catch up with the
other fellows He can finishing the hoeing when he gets back

Youll do it anyhow and youre not going swimming Now thats the end
of it You march out to that garden this minute or Ill take a stick to
you And dont let me hear another whimper out of you Robbie Come back
here and shut that door properly I shall tell your father how you have
acted Wouldnt be ashamedId be ashamed to show temper that way

It says for children to obey their parents but if more boys minded
their mothers there would be fewer able to swim While I shrink
with horror from even seeming to encourage dropping the hoe when the
sewingmachine gets to going good by its thunderous spinning throwing
up an impervious wall of sound to conceal retreat into the back alley
across the street up the alley back of Alexanders and so on up
to Fountain Avenue in time to catch up with the gang still I regard
swimming as an exercise of the extremest value in the development of the
growing boy It builds up every muscle It is particularly beneficial
to the lungs To have a good pair of lungs is the same thing as having
a good constitution It is nice to have a healthy boy and it is nice to
have an obedient boy but if one must choose which he will havethats
a very difficult question I think it should be left to the casuists
Nevertheless now is the boys only chance to grow He will have
abundant opportunities to learn obedience

In the last analysis there are two ways of acquiring the art of
swimming the sudden way and the slow way I have never personally known
anybody that learned in the sudden way but I have heard enough about it
to describe it It its the quickest known method One day the boy its
among the gibbering white monkeys at the rivers edge content to splash
in the water that comes but half way to his crouching knees The next
day he swims with the big boys as bold as any of them In the meantime
his daddy has taken him out in a boat out where it is deepOh Aint
it deep thereand thrown him overboard The boat is kept far enough
away to be out of the boys reach and yet near enough to be right there
in case anything happens I like that in case anything happens It
sounds so cheerful It being what Aristotle defines as a groundhog
case the boy learns to swim immediately He has to

It seems reasonable that he should But still and all I dont just
fancy it Once when a badly scared man grabbed me by the arms in deep
water I had the fear of drowning take hold of my soul and it isnt a
nice feeling at all Somehow when I hear folks praising up this method
of teaching a child to swim I seem to hear the little fellows screams
that he doesnt want to be thrown into the water I can see him clinging
to his father for protection and finding that heart hard and unpitying
I can see his fingernails whiten with his clutch on anything that gives
a handhold His father strips off his grip at first with boisterous
laughter and then with hot anger at the little fool He calls him a
crybaby and slaps his mouth for him to stop his noise The little
body sprawls in the air and strikes with a loud splash and the childs
gargling cry is strangled by the water whitened by his mad clawings I
can see his head come up his eyes bulging and his face distorted with
the awful fear that is ours by the inheritance of ages He will sink and
come up again not three times but a hundred times Eventually he will
win safe to shore panting and trembling his little heart knocking
against his ribs it is true but lord of the water from that time
forth It is a very fine method yes but well if it was my boy I
had just as lief he tarried with the little white monkeys at the rivers
edge Let him squeal and crouch and splash and learn how to half drown
the other fellow by shooting water at him with the heel of his hand
Let him alone He will be watching the others swim He will edge out a
little farther and kick up his heels while with his hands he holds on
the ground He will edge out a little farther still and try to keep his
feet on the bottom and swim with his hands Be patient in his attempt to
combine the two methods of travel He is not the only one that fears to
be one thing or the other and regards a mixture of both as the safest
way to get along

No I cannot say that I wholly approve of the sudden method of learning
to swim It has the advantange of lumping all the scares of a lifetime
into one and having it over with and yet I dont suppose the scare of
being thrown into the water by ones daddy is really greater than being
ducked in midstream by some hulking cacklevoiced big boy It seems
greater though I suppose because a fellow cannot very well relieve
his feelings by throwing stones at his daddy and bawling Goldarn you
anyhow youyou big stuff Ill get hunk with you now you see if I
dont Here would be just the place to make the little boy tie knots
in the big boys shirtsleeves soak the knots in water and pound them
between stones But that is kind of common I think They told about it
at the swimminghole above the dam but nobody was mean enough to do it
Maybe they did it down at the Copperas Banks below town The boys from
across the tracks went there a race apart whom we feared and who
hated us if the legend chalked up on the fences DAMB THE PRODESTANCE
meant anything

Under the slow method of learning to swim one had leisure to observe the
different fashionsdogfashion and cowfashion steamboatfashion
and such The little kids and beginners swam dogfashion which on that
account was considered contemptible The fellow was sneered at that
screwed up his face as if in a cloud of suffocating dust and fought the
water with noise and fury putting forth enough energy to carry him a
mile and actually going about two feet if he were headed down stream
Scientific men say that the use of the limbs first on one side and then
on the other is instinctive to all creatures of the monkey tribe That
is the way they do in an emergency since that is the way to scramble up
among the tree limbs I know that it is the easiest way to swim and
the least effective When the arms are extended together in the breast
stroke it is as much superior to dogfashion as man is superior to the
ape I have always thought that to swim thus with steady and deliberate
arm action the water parting at the chin and rising just to the root of
the underlip was the most dignified and manly attitude the human being
could put himself in Cowfashion was a burlesque of this and the
swimmer reared out of water with each stroke creating tidal waves It
was thought to be vastly comic Steamboatfashion was where a fellow
swam on his back keeping his body up by a gentle secret paddling
motion with his hands while with his feet he lashed the water into
foam like some river sternwheeler If he could cry Hoo hoo hoo
in hoarse falsetto to mimic the whistle it was an added charm

It was a redheaded boy from across the tracks on his good behavior at
the swimminghole above the dam that I first saw swim handoverhand or
sailorfashion as we called it rightly or wrongly I know not I can
hear now the crisp staccato little smack his hand gave the water as he
reached forward

It has ever since been my envy and despair It is so knowing so
sporty I class it with being able to wear a pinkbarred shirt front
with a diamondcluster pin in it with having my clothes so nobby and
stylish that one thread more of modishness would be beyond the human
power to endure with being genuinely fond of horseracing with being
a firstclass poker player I mean a really firstclass one with being
able to swallow a drink of whisky as if I liked it instead of having
to choke it down with a shudder with knowing truly great men like
Fitzsimmons or whoever it is that is great now so as to be able to
slap him on the back and say Why hello Bob old boy how are you
with being delighted with the company of actors instead of finding them
as thin as tissuepaperwhat wouldnt I give if I could be like that
My life has been a sad one But I might find some comfort in it yet if
I coin only get that natty little spat on the water when I lunge forward
swimming overhand

We used to think the Old Swimminghole was a bully place but I know
better now The sycamore leaned well out over the water and there was
a trapeze on the branch that grew parallel with the shore but the water
near it was never deep enough to dive into And that is another occasion
of humiliation I cant dive worth a cent When I go down to the slip
behind Fulton Marketthey sell fish at Fulton Market just follow your
nose and you cant miss itand see the rows of little white monkeys
doing nothing but diving I realize that the Old Swimminghole with all
its beauties its green leafiness its clean long grass to lie upon
while drying in the sun or to pull out and bite off the tender
chromeyellow ends was but a provincial countryfake affair There
were no watermelon rinds there no broken berrybaskets no orange peel
no nothing All the fish in it were just common live ones And there was
no diving But at the real proper city swimmingplace all the little
white monkeys can dive Each is gibbering and shrieking Hey Chimmeel
Chimmee Hey Chimmee Chimmee Hey CHIMMEEEE Howss t iss
crossing himself and tipping over head first coming up so as to lay
his hair giving a shaking snort to clear his nose and mouth of water
regaining the ladder with three overhand strokes every one of them
with that natty little spat that I cant get climbing up to the
stringpiece and running for Chimmy redeyed shivering and dripping
to ask How wass Cat And I cant dive for a centthat is I cant
dive from a great elevation I set my teeth and vow I just will dive
from ten feet above the water and every time it gets down to a poor
picayune dive off the lowest round of the ladder I blame my early
education for it I was taught to be careful about pitching myself head
foremost on rocks and broken bottles I used to think it was a fine
swimminghole and that I was having a grand good time well worth any
ordinary licking but now that I have traveled around and seen things I
know that it was a poor provincial countryjake affair after all
The first time I swam across and back without letting down it was
certainly an immense place but when I went back there a year ago last
summerwhy pshaw it wasnt anything at all It was a dry summer
I admit but not as dry as all that A poor pitiful provincial
twofora centand yet and yet And yet I sat there after I had
dressed and mused upon the former thingsthe life that was but never
could be again the Eden before whose gate was a flaming sword turning
every way The night was still and moonless The Milky Way slanted
across the dark dome above It was far from the street lamps that
greened among the leafy maples in the silent streets Gushes of air
stirred the fluttering sycamore and whispered in the tall larches that
marched down the boundary line of the Blymire property The last group
of swimmers had turned into the road from around the clump of willows at
the end of the pasture The boy that is always the last one had nearly
caught up with the others for the velvet pat of his bare feet in the
deep dust was slowing Their eager chatter softened and softened until
it blended with the sounds of night that verge on silence the fall of a
leaf the upspringing of a trodden tuft of grass the sleepy twitter
of a dreaming bird and the shrilling of locusts patiently turning a
creaking wheel I heard the thump of hoofs and buggy wheels booming
in the covered bridge and a shudder came upon me that was not all the
chill of falling dew Again I was a little boy standing in a circle of
my fellows and staring at something pale stretched out upon the ground
Ben Snyder had dived for It and found It and brought It up and laid It
on the long clean grass Some one had said we ought to get a barrel and
roll It on the barrel but there was none there And then some one
said No it was against the law to touch anything like That before
the Coroner came So though we wished that something might be done
we were glad the law stepped in and stringently forbade us touching what
our flesh crept to think of touching No longer existed for us the boy
that had the spyglass and the Swiss Family Robinson Something cold
and terrible had taken his place something that could not see and yet
looked upward with unwinking eyes The gloom deepened and the dew began
to fall We could hear the boy that ran for the doctor whimpering a long
way off We wanted to go home and yet we dared not Something might get
us And we could not leave That alone in the dark with Its eyes wide
open The locusts in the grass turned and turned their creaking wheel
and the wind whispered in the tall larches We heard the thump of hoofs
and wheels booming in the covered bridge It was the doctor come too
late He put his head down to Its bosom the cold trickled down our
backs and then he said it was too late If we had known enough he
said we might have saved him We slunk away It was very lonesome We
kept together and spoke low We stopped to hearken for a moment outside
the house where the boy had lived that had the spyglass and the Swiss
Family Robinson Some one had told his mother And then with a great
and terrible fear within us we ran each to his own home swiftly and
silently We knew now why mother did not want us to go swimming

But the next afternoon when Chuck Grove whistled in our back alley and
held up two fingers I dropped the hoe and went with him It was bright
daylight then and that is different from the night




THE FIREMENS TOURNAMENT

It isnt only Christmas that comes but once a year and when it comes it
brings good cheer its any festival that is worth a hill of beans High
School Commencement Fourth of July Sundayschool excursion Election
bonfire Thanksgiving Day a nice day and one whereon you can eat roast
turkey till you cant choke down another bite and pumpkinpie and
cranberry sauce Tell youbut about the best in the whole lot and
something the city folks dont have is Firemens Tournament That comes
once a year generally about the time for putting up tomatoes

The first that most of us know about it is when we see the bills up
telling how much excursion rates will be to our town from Ostrander
and Mt Victory and Wapatomica and New Berlin and Fosters
and Caledonia and Mechanicsburgall the towns around on both the
railroads But before that there was the Citizens Committee and then
the Executive Committee and the Finance Committee and the Committee
on Press and Publicity and Printing and Prizes and Decorations and
Badges and Music and Reception to Firemen and Reception to Guestsas
many committees as there are nails in the fence from your house to mine
And these committees come around and tell you that we want to show the
folks that weve got public spirit in our town some spunk some gitup
to us We want our town to contrast favorably with Caledonia where they
had the Tournament last year We want to put it all over the Caledonia
people they think theyre so smart and we can do it too if
everybody will take aholt and help Well we want all we can get We
expect a pretty generous offer from you for one Man that has as pretty
and tasty gotup store as you have and does the business that you do
ought to show his appreciation of the town and try to help along
Oh anything youre a mind to give Most anything comes in handy for
prizes But what we principally need is cash ready cash You see
theres a good deal of expense attached to an enterprise of this
character So many little things you wouldnt think of that youve

The Ladies Aid of Center Street M E has secured the storeroom
recently vacated by Rouse  Meyers and is going to serve a dinner that
day for the benefit of the Carpet Fund of their church and about time
too I say I like to broke my neck there a week ago last Sunday night
when our minister was away Caught my foot in a hole in the carpet and
a little more and wouldnt have gone headlong So its Why Ive been
meaning for more than a year to call on you Mrs MrsLet me
look at my list Oh yes Mrs Cooper but weve had so much sickness
at homeyou know my husbands father is staying with us at present
and hes been in very poor health all winterand when it hasnt been
sickness its been company You know how it is And it seemed as if
Ijustcouldnot make out to get up your way What a pretty little
place you have So cozy I was just saying to Mrs Thorpe here it was
so seldom you saw a really pretty residence in this part of town We
think that up on the hill where we reside you know is about the
handsomest Yes there are a great many wealthy people live up
there The Quackenbushes are enormously wealthy I was saying to Mrs
Quackenbush only the other day that I thought the hill people were
almost too exclusive  Yes it is a perfectly lovely day
ErerWere soliciting for the Firemens Tournamentwell not for the
Tournament exactly but the Ladies Aid are going to give a dinner
that day for the Carpet Fund and we thought perhaps you d like to help
along Oh any little thing a boiled ham or Well we shall want
some cake but wed drutheror at least rawtherhave something more
substantial dont you know pie or pickles or jelly dont you know
And will you bring it or shall I send Michael with the carriage for
it Oh thank you If you would It would be so much appreciated
So sorry we couldnt make a longer stay but now that weve found the
way Yes thats very true Well goodafternoon

The lady of the house watches them as Michael inquires Whur next
mum and bangs the door of the carriage Then she turns and says to
herself Huh Mrs Thorpe is that instant observing Did you notice
that crayon enlargement she had hanging up Wouldnt it kill you To
which the other lady responds Well between you and I Mrs Thorpe if
I couldnt have a real handpainted picture I wouldnt have nothing at
all

The lady of the house bakes a cake Shell show them a thing or two in
the cake line And while it is in the oven what does that little dev
that provoking Freddie do but see if he cant jump across the kitchen
in two jumps Fall What cake wouldnt fall Of course it falls But it
is too late now to bake another and if they dont like it they know
what they can do She doesnt know that shes under any obligation to
them

Mrs John Van Meter hears Freddie say off the little speech his mother
taught himOh you may be sure shed be there as large as life taking
charge of everything just as if she had been one of the workers
when to my certain knowledge she hadnt been to one of the committee
meetings not a one I declare I dont know what Mr Craddock is
thinking of to let her boss every body around the way she doesand she
smiles and says Its all right Its just lovely Tell your mamma Mrs
Van Meter is ever and ever so much obliged to her Isnt he a dear boy
And when he is gone she says What are we ever going to do with
all this cake It seems as if everybody has sent cake And whatever
possessed that woman to attempt a cake Icant imagine Ts ts ts
Hwell Oh put it somewhere Maybe we can work it off on the country
people Mrs Filkins your coffee smells PERfectly grand Perfectly
grand Do you think well have spoons enough

The Tournament prizes are exhibited in the windows of the leading
furniture emporium at the corner of Main and Center each with a card
attached bearing the name of the donor in distinctly legible characters
Old man Hagerman has been mowing all the ragweed and cuckleburrs along
the line of march and the lawns have had an unusual amount of shaving
and sprinkling Out near the end of Center Street the grandstand has
been going up tiers of seats rising from each curb line The street has
been rolled and sprinkled and scraped until it is in fine condition for
a running track Why dont you pick up that pebble and throw it over
into the lot Suppose some runner should slip on that stone and fall and
hurt himself youd be to blame

The day before the Tournament they hang the banner

 WELCOME VOLUNTEER FIREMEN

from Cases drugstore across to the Furniture Emporium Along the line
of march you may see the man of the house up on a stepladder against
the front porch with his hands full of drapery and his mouth full of
tacks His wife is backing toward the geranium bed to get a good view
cocking her head on one side

How v vif he asks as well as he can for the tacks

Little higher Oh not so much Down a little Whope thats  Oh
plague take the firemen Just look at that Mercy Mercy

The man of the house cant turn his head

Oh I wouldnt have had it happen for I dont know what Ts Ts Ts
That lovely silverleaf geranium that Mrs Pritchard give me a slip of
Broke right off Oh my My My Do you spose itd grow if I was to
stick it into the ground just as it is with all them buds on it

The man of the house lets one end of the drapery go and empties his
mouth of tacks into his disengaged hand

I dont know Ow jabbed right into my gum But I can tell you this
If you think Im going to stick up on this ladder all morning while you
carry on about some fool old geranium that you can just as well fuss
with when Im gone why youre mighty much mistaken

Well you neednt take my head off I feel awful about that geranium

Well why dont you look where youre going Is this right

Yes I told you I wish now Id done it myself I cant ask you to do a
thing about the house but theres a row raised right away

People that dont want to go to the trouble of tacking up these alphabet
flags on the edge of the veranda eaves it takes fourteen of them to
spell WELCOME FIREMEN say they think a handsome flaga really
handsome one not one of these twentyfive centersis as pretty and
rich looking a decoration as a body can put up

Tents are raised in the vacant lots along Center Street and counters
knocked together for the sale of icecold lemonade lemo lemo lemo
made in the shade with a spade by an old maid lemo lemo Here y are
now gents gitch nice cool drink ony five a glass There is even the
hook for the icecream candy man to throw the taffy over when he pulls
it I like to watch him It makes me dribble at the mouth to think about
it

The man that sells the squawking toys and the rubber balloons on sticks
is in town All he can say is Fi cent He will blow up the balloons
tomorrow morning The men with the blackvelvet covered shields all
stuck full of souvenirs are here and the men with the little canes
I guess well have a big crowd if it doesnt rain What does the paper
say about the weather

The boys have been playing a new game for some time past but it is
only this evening that you notice it The way of it is this You take
an expresswagonit has to have real wheels these sawedout wheels
are too babyand you tie a long rope to the tongue and fix loops on the
rope so that the boys can put each a loop over his shoulder You want
a good many boys And you get big long thick pieces of rag and you
take and tie them so as to make a big big long piece about as long as
from here to way over there And you lay this in the wagon kind of in
folds like Then you go up to where they water the horses and two of you
go at the back end of the wagon and the rest put the loops over their
shoulders and one boy says Are you ready and he has a Fourth of
July pistol and he shoots off a cap And when you hear that you run
like the dickens and the two boys behind the wagon let out the hose the
big long thick piece of rag and fix it so it lies about straight on
the ground And when you have run as far as the hose will reach the boy
with the Fourth of July pistol says Twentyeight and twofifths
and thats the game And the kids dont like for big folks to stand and
watch them because they always make fun so

In other towns they have Boys Companies organized strictly for
Tournament purposes There was talk of having one here Mat King the
assistant chief was all for having one so that we could compete in what
he calls the juveline contests but it fell through somehow


Along about sunup you hear the big farmwagons clattering into town
chairs in the wagon bed and Paw and Maw and Mary Elizabeth and
Martin Luther and all the family clean down to Teedy the baby Hes
named after Theodore Roosevelt and they have the letter home now
framed and hanging up over the organ But for all the wagon is so full
there is room for a big basket covered with a redended towel Seems to
me I smell fried chicken dont you

I just thought Idt see if youd bite Youve formed your notions
of country people from The Old Homestead and these bygoshMirandy
novels The real farmers nowadays drive into town in doubleseated
carriages with matched bays curried so that you can see to comb
your hair in their glossy sides The single rigs sparkle in the sun
conveying young men and young women of such cleancut highbred
features as to make us wonder And yet I dont know why we should
wonder either They all come from good old stock The young fellows
run a little too strongly to patentleather shoes and their horses are
almost too skittish for my liking but the girls are all right If their
clothes set better than you thought they would why you must remember
that they subscribe for the very same fashion magazines that you do and
there is such a thing as a mailorder business in this country even if
you arent aware of it

All the little boys in town are out with their baskets chanting sadly

 PEANUTS FIVE A BAG

You ll hear that all day long

But there isnt much going on before the excursion trains come in Then
things begin to hop The grand marshal and his aides gallop through
the streets as if they were going for the doctor The trains of ten and
fifteen coaches pile up in the railroad yard and the yardmaster nearly
goes out of his mind People are so anxious to get out of the cars in
which they have been packed and jammed for hours that they dont mind
a little thing like being run over by a switching engine Every platform
is just one solid chunk of summer hats and babies and red shirts and
alto horns They have been nearly five hours coming fifty miles Stopped
at every station and sidetracked for all the regular trains Such a
time Lots of fun though The fellows got out and pulled flowers and
seed cucumbers and things and threw them at folks You never saw such
cutups as they are Pretty good singers too Good part of the way
they sung My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean and How Can I Bear to Leave
Thee nice and slow you know a good deal of tenor and not much bass
and plenty of these minor chords Yes I know some people call them
barbershop chords but I think minor is a nicer name

The band played Hiawatha eighteen times One old fellow got on at
Huntsville and he says to Joe Bangs thats the leader Shay he
says play Turkey in er Straw wont you Aw go on Play it Thass
goof feller Go on

Joe he never heard of the tune Dont you know it Goes like this 
No that aint it Thats Gray Eagle Funny I cant think how that
tune starts Well no matter They played an arrangement that had Old
Zip Coon in it

Naw he says tha ain it t all Go on Play it Play Turkey in
er Straw Ah ye dont know it Thass reason Betch don know it Don
know Turkey in er Straw Ho Caw seff mlm sishn Ho Youyouyou
ain no msishn Youyou youre zis bluff Only about halfpast eight
too Think of that So early in the morning Ah me Thats one of the
sad features of such an occasion

If there is anything more magnificent than a firemens parade I dont
know what it is The varnished woodwork on the apparatus looks as if it
had just come out of the shop and every bit of bright work glitters fit
to strike you blind You take now a nice hosereel painted white and
striped into panels with a fine red line every other panel fruits and
flowers and every other panel a piece of lookingglass shaped like a
cut of pie and I tell you it looks gay Thats what it does It looks
gay Some of the hookandladder trucks are just one mass of
goldenrod and hydrangeas and some of them are all fixed with this
redwhiteandblue paper rope sort of chenille effect or more like a
feather boa Everybody has on white cotton gloves and those entitled to
carry speaking trumpets have bouquets in the bells of them salvias and
goldenrod and nasturtiums and marigolds and all such

The Wapatomicas always have a dog up on top of their wagon First off
you would think it didnt help out much it is such a forlorn looking
little fice but this dog I want you to know waked up the folks late
one night way long about ten or eleven oclock barking at a fire
Saved the town as you might say And after that the fireboys took him
for a mascot I guess he didnt belong to anybody before And another
wagon has a chair on it and in that chair the cutest little girl you
almost eyer saw hair all frizzed at the ends and a wide blue sash and
her white frock starched as stiff as a milkpail Everybody says Aw
aint she just too sweet

The Caledonias have tried to make quite a splurge this year They walk
four abreast with their arms locked and their white gloves on each
others shoulders Their truck has on it what they call an allegorical
figure There is a kind of a business looks to me like it is the axle
and wheels of a toy wagon stood up on end and covered with white paper
muslin and a string tied around the middle that is supposed to be an
hourglass Then there is a scythe covered with cotton batting and then
a man in a bathrobe I saw the figure of the goods when the wind blew
it open also covered with white cotton batting The man has a wig and
beard of wicking First I thought it was Santa Claus and then I saw
the scythe and knew it must be old Father Time The hourglass puzzled
me no little though The man has cotton batting wings One of them is
a little wabbly but what can you expect from Caledonia Theyre always
trying to butt the bull off the bridge Theyre jealous of our town Oh
they stooped to all the mean underhanded tricks you ever heard of to
get the canning factory to go to their place instead of here But we
know a thing or two ourselves Yes we got the canning factory all
right all right

Did you notice how neat and trim our boys looked None of this flubdub
of scarlet shirts with a big white monogram on the breast or these
fawncolored suits with querlycues of braid all over They spot very
easily And did you notice how the Caledonias had long lean men
walking with short fat men and nobody keeping step Our boys were all
carefully graded and matched and their dark blue uniforms with just the
neat nickel badge I think presented the best appearance of all And
Ill tell you another thing Theyll put it all over the Caledonias this
afternoon They wont let em get a smell

Dont you like the fifeanddrum corps The fifes set my teeth on edge
but I could follow the drums all day with their

 Tucket a brum brum brumbrum tuckall de brum
 Tucket a brumbrum tuckall de brumbrumbrum
 Tucket a blipblipblipblip tucka tuckall de brum
 Tucket a brumbrum tuckall de brumbrumbrum

Part of the time the drummers click their sticks together instead of
hitting the drumhead Thats what makes it sound so nice I wish I
could play the snaredrum

In the Mechanicsburg band is a boy about fourteen years old a muscular
sturdy chunk of a lad He walks with his heels down his calves bulged
out behind his head up and the regular proper swagger of a bandsman
He hasnt any uniform but hes all right He plays a solo B part and
he and the other solo cornet spell each other On the repeat of every
strain my boy rests and rubs his lips with his forefinger while he
looks at the populace with bright expectant eyes When he blows he
scowls and brings the cushion of muscle on the point of his chin clear
up to his under lip and he draws his breath through the corners of his
mouth Hes the real thing Bright boy too I judge the kind that has
a quick answer for everybody like Aw go chase yerself or Go on
yeh big stiff Watch him on the countermarch when they pass the Radnor
cornet band The Radnors broke up the Mechanicsburg band last year
and theyre going to try to do it again this year The musicians blow
themselves the color of a huckleberry and the drummers grit their
teeth and try to pound holes in their sheepskins Aha Its the Radnor
band got rattled in its time this year Went all to pieces The boy
snatches a rest Yah he squawks Didge ever get left and picks up
the tune again I wish I could play the cornet Wouldnt play solo B or
I wouldnt play anyOoooooooh Did you see that Took that stick by the
other end from the knob and slung it away way up in the air whirling
like sixty and caught it when it came down and never missed a step
Look at him juggle it from hand to hand over his shoulder and behind
his back and under one leg whirling so fast that you can hardly see
it and all in perfect step Whope I thought he was going to drop it
that time but he didnt Thats something you dont see in the cities
There all the drummajor does with his stick is just to point it the
way the band is to go I like our fashion the best Geeminentally Look
at that I bet it went up in the air forty feet if it went an inch I
wish I was a drummajor I guess Id sooner be a drummajor than anything
else Oh well detectivethats different

Lets go farther along Dont get too near the judges stand I know
Its the best place to see the finish of an event but Ive been to
Firemens Tournament before You let me pick out the seats Up close to

Next is a wet race Now look out Lets see what the program says Run
seventyfive yards to structure on top of which an empty barrel has
been placed with spout outlet near top Barrel to be filled with water
by means of buckets from reservoirThat big tinlined box opposite
is the reservoir They are filling it now with a hose attached to the
waterplug yonderuntil water issues from spout What are they all
laughing at Which one Oh but isnt she mad Talk about a wet hen
Why Charley the hose got away from the man that was filling the
reservoir and the lady was splashed Why dont you use your eyes and see
whats going on and not be bothering me to tell you Ip There it goes
again Oh ho ho ho hee hee didnt I tell you it would be fun See
it run out of his sleeves I always get to coughing when I laugh as
hard as that Oh dear me Makes the tears come

These are the fellows from Luxora Oh the clumsy things Let the ladder
get away from them and it fell and hit that man in the second row right
on the head Hope it didnt hurt him much See em scurry with the water
buckets Aw get a move on Get a move Why what makes them so slow
Water water Well I should think as much Not for themselves though
Those fellows at the bottom of the ladder are catching it arent they
Oh pshaw they dont mind it They get it worse than that at a real
fire when they arent half so well fixed for it Why is there no bottom
to that barrel at all Why look Say the judge forgot to close the
valve Theres a hose connected with the bottom of the barrel to run the
water off after each trial and hes forgotten to Well isnt that
too bad All that work for nothing I suppose theyll let them try
it over again That man must have got a pretty hard rap Theyre
carrying him out His heads all bloody Wapatomicas I guess Yes
Wapatomicas I hope the valves closed this time Whope did you see
that One fellow got hit with a water bucket and it was about halffull
Its running out of the spout Yes and its falling on those people
right where you wanted to sit Hear the girls squeal Talk about your
fun I dont want any better fun than this Look at em come down the
ladder just holding the sides with their hands They couldnt do that if
the ladder was dry

Ah heres our crowd Come on Come on Come on COME ON Oh dont be
so slow with those buckets Arent they fine Say they dont care if
they do spill a drop or two Why Why what are they coming down for
It isnt running out of the spout yet Come back COME BACK Oh pshaw
Just threw it away by being in too much of a hurry That judge looks
funny doesnt he with a rubber overcoat on and the sun shining See
hes telling them One bucket more Theyll let em have another
trial of course No Oh thats an outrage That s not fair The
Caledonias will get it now Yes sir they did get it Oh well
accidents will happen What Wheres Caledonia now Well they got it

that did it though

The next is where they run three hundred feet from the judges stand
raise ladder hose company to couple to hydrant break coupling in hose
and put on nozzle scale ladder and fill twentyfive gallon barrel
Only the Caledonias and our boys are entered in this Now well see
which is the best All right Mary I wont say a word Say for
countryjakes those Caledonias didnt do so badly I give them that
much Look at the water fly Ill bet those folks near the judges stand

seats dont you I told you Id been to Firemens Tournaments before
What Youll have to talk louder than that if you want me to hear with
all this noise Oh thatll be all right Theyll be so hungry they

anything to brag of or to carry brooms about All the fifeanddrum

THE DEVOURING ELEMENT


Mr Silverstone was gloomily considering whether he had not better blow
out the lights in the New York One Price Clothing Store and lock up for
the night Kerosene was fifteen cents a gallon and not a customer had
been in since suppertime Business was ofle simbly ofle

The streets were empty There were lights only in the barber shop where
one patron was being lathered while two mandolins and a guitar gave a
correct imitation of two houseflies and a bluebottle in Rileys
where in default of other occupation Mr Riley was counting up
in Oesterles where a hot discussion was going on as to whether
Christopher Columbus was a Dutchman or a Dago and in Millers where
Tom Ball was telling Tony who impassively wiped the perforated brass
plate let into the top of the bar that he Tom Ball coul lick em man
ill Logan couny

Lamps shone in every parlor where little girls labored with And one
and two three and one and two three occasionally coming out to look
at the clock to see if the hour was any nearer being up than it was
five minutes ago They also shone in sittingrooms where boys looked
fiercely at X2 2Xyy2 mothers placidly darned stockings and
fathers Weekly Examiner in hand patiently struggled to disengage from
boilerplate and bogus news about people snatched from the jaws of
death by the timely use of Dr McKinnons Healing Extract of Timothy and
Redtop items of real news such as who was sick and what ailed them
who cut his foot with the ax while splitting stovewood and where the
cake sale by the Rectors Aid of Grace PE would be held next week

At the prayermeeting Uncle Billy Nicholson was giving in his
experience and had just got to that part about Sometimes on
the mountaintop and sometimes in the valley but still
nevertheless when all of a sudden something happened

The mandolins stopped with a jerk Mr Riley stood tranced at And ten
is thirtyfive Mr Ball was stricken dumb in the celebration of his
own great physical powers The crowd in Oesterles forgot Columbus and
were as men beholding a ghost The drowsy congregation sat up rigid and
Mr Silverstone gave a guilty start He had been thinking of that very
thing

The next instant front doors were wrenched open and the street echoed
with the sound of windows being raised Fathers and sons rushed out on
the front porch followed by little girls to whom any excuse to stop
practising was like a plank to a drowning man

They had heard aright Up by the Soldiers Monument fell the clump of
tired feet and upon the air floated the wild alarm of

FIRE Poohha FIRE Poof FIRE

Mat King the assistant chief kicked off his slippers and swiftly
laced up his shoes grabbed his speakingtrumpet and his helmet and
tore out of the house If he could only get to the enginehouse before
Charley Lomax the chief But Charley was the lone customer in the
barbers char With the lather on one side of his face he clapped on
his hat and broke for the firebell four doors below

The news thus being passed the fresher runners scampered ahead
bawling FOYURRR FOYURRR and Linc the hero slowed down gasping

cant have you running hither and yon all hours of the night and we not
know where you are Well hurry up then mother Take him in with you
Oh just throw a shawl over your head Nobody ll see you or if they
do they wont care The apparatus trundles by the bells on the trucks
tolling sadly as the striking gear on the rear axle engages the cam A
hurrying throng scuffles by in the gloom The tolling grows fainter the
throng thinner

Good land Is she going to be all night Wish t I hadnt proposed it
Thats the worst of taking a woman anyplace Fuss and fiddle by the
hour in front of the lookingglass Em Be all over by the time we get
there Oh Em Em EM Holler my head offl EM Well why dont

interesting as possible Oh no not altogether on your account No
no Ha Hahaha Hum ah Well yes if she ever gets done primping
up Oh there you are Miss Shoemaker let me make you acquainted with
my wife Now you girlsll have to get a move on if you want to see
anything

The male escorts grasp the ladies arms and shove them ahead that being
the only way if you are ever going to get any place The women gasp and
pant and make a great todo

Ooh Wait till I get my breath Will Weeull Dont go so fayust
Oooh I cant stand it Oh well youre a man

But when they turn the corner that gives them a good view of the
blaze fluttering great puffs of flame and hear the steady crackle and
snapping as it were of a great popper full of popcorn they too
catch the infection and run with a loud swashing and slatting of
skirts giggling and squealing about their hair coming down

In the waving orange glare the crowd is seen shifting and moving It
seems impossible for the onlookers to remain constant in one spot The
chief Charley Lomax is gesticulating with wide arm movements He puts
his speakingtrumpet to his mouth Yoffemoffemoffemoffemoffi he says

Whaat the men halloo back

Yoffemoffemoffemoffemoff

Whatd he say

Search me John you run over and ask him what he wants Or no Ill
go myself

Why in Sam Hill didnt you come sooner demands the angry chief

Well why in Sam Hill dont you talk so s a body can understand you
Yoffemoffemoffemoffem Who can make sense out o that

The hose aint long enough to reach from here to the hydrant You n
some more of em run down t th house an git that other reel

Aw say Chief Look here Im awful busy right now Cant somebody
else go

You go an do what I tell you to and dont gimme none o your back
talk

Too daggon bossy and dictatorial that Charley Lomax is Getting
most too big for his breeches Never mind theres going to be a fire
election week from Tuesday See whether hell be chief next year or not
Sending a man away from the fire right at the most interesting part

Ill go Chief wommetoo puts in jumbo Lee all in a huddle of
words Ije slivsnot Aw ri Mon Jim Shoonmeansmore of em go
gitthotherreel

Jumbo isnt a member of the fire department though he is wild to join
He isnt old enough He is six feet one inch weighs 180 and wont
be sixteen till the 5th of next February Nobody ever saw him when
he wasnt eating They say he clips his words so as to save time for
eating He takes a cracker out of his pocket shoves it in his mouth
whole jams his hat down till his ears stick out and with his
companions tears down the road seemingly propelled as much by his
elbows as by his legs Why under the combined strain of growing and
running he doesnt part a seam somewhere is a dark mystery

Crash The roof of the barn caves in and reveals what we had not before
suspected that Platts barn on the other side of the alley is afire
too Say This is getting interesting The wind is setting directly
toward Swopes house It has been so terribly dry this last month or
so that the house will go like powder if it ever catches Why I think
Swope has a well and cistern both Used to have anyway before they put
the waterworks in and the board of health condemned the wells Say
There was a putup job if there ever was one Why sure Sure he had
stock in the water works Doc Muzzey I guess yes Pity they ever
traded off the handengine They got a lightrunning hookandladder
truck Won two prizes at the tournament just with that truck But if
they had that handengine now though Up with her Down with her Have
that fire out in no time

Theyre not trying to save the barns Theyre a dead loss What little
water they can get from the cisterns and wells aroundhasnt it been
drythey are using to try to save Swopes house and the one next
to it Is that where Lonny Wheeler lives I knew it was up this way
somewhere Dont he look ridiculous sitting up there astraddle of his
ridgepole with a tincup A tincup if you please Over this way
a little See better Theyre wetting down the roof Line of fellows
passing buckets to the ladder and a line up the ladder What big sparks
those are Puts you in mind of Fourth of July How the roof steams Must
be hot up there

Ooooh

A universal indrawn breath from all spectators proclaims their horror
One of the men on the roof missed his footing and slipped rolling over
and over till he reached the roof of the porch where he spreadeagled
for a fall The women begin to moan Some poor fellow gone to his death
Or if he be so lucky as to miss death itself he is doomed to languish
all his days a helpless cripple Like enough the sole support of an aged
mother or perhaps his wife is sitting up for him at home now tiptoeing
into the bedroom every little while to look at the sleeping children
Thats generally the way of it Who is there so free and footloose
that if harm befall him some woman will not go mourning all her days
It must take the heart out of brave men to think what their women folk
must suffer mothers and wives andWho Dan OBrien Oh hell be all
right Hell light on his feet like a cat I believe that boy is made of
India rubber He never gets hurt Why one timeAh There he goes
now up the ladder as if nothing had happened Hoorayayayay
Hoorayayayay I thought hed broken his neck as sure as shooting

Wandering about one cannot fail to encounter what the gallant
fireladdies have rescued from the devouring element There is the piano
with a deep scratch across the upper part and the top lid hanging by
one hinge It caught in the door and the boys were kind of in a hurry
There is the parlor carpet plucked up by the roots as it were and
two tubs the washboard and a bag of clothespins a stuffed chair
with three casters gone the coffeepot a crayon enlargement a winter
overcoat a blanket a pile of old dresses the screwdriver and a paper
of tacks in the colander the couch with a triangular rip in the cover
the coalscuttle a pile of dishes the ax and woodsaw a fancy pillow
the sewingmachine with the top gone the washboiler the basket of
dirty clothes with the stoveshaker and the parlor clock in together
and a heap of books all spraddled and sprawled every which way Upon
this pitiful mound sits Mrs Swope with her baby sound asleep upon her
bosom She mingles her tears with the sustaining tea that Mrs Farley
has made for her Swope still in his socks and with his wifes
shouldercape upon him caught up somehow is trying to soothe her He
is as mad as a hornet and doesnt dare to show it All this furniture
he had insured It was all old stuff their folks had given them If the
gallant fireladdies had been as discreet as they were zealous they
would have let the furniture go and Swope and his wife would have had
an entire brandnew outfit As it is who can ever make that junk look
like anything any more

Whats this coming up the road Jumbo Lee and his friends with the other
hosereel Now they will connect it with the hydrant and have water
aplenty to save the house Now the fellows are coming down from the
ladder Cisterns empty I suppose The other reel didnt come any too
soon How the roof steams Or is it smoking

Dont stand around here with that reel Up to that waterplug Farther
up the street Front o Cumminss

Jumbo crams another cracker into his mouth and speeds away hunching the
patient unresenting air with his elbows

Ah Seethat little flicker of flame on the roof Do for pitys sake
hurry up with that connection The roof is really burning See They are
trying to chop away the burning place But theres another And another

Aaah Hoorayay Connections made Now youll see something Out of
the way there One side One side Up you go Whaat Is that the
best they can do Why it wont run out of the nozzle at all when its
up on the roof Not a drop Feeble little dribble when its on the
groundlevel Theres your waterworks for you It is a good long way
from the fireplug I know but there ought to be more pressure than
that Oh pshaw If we only had the old handengine Up with her Down
with her Have that fire out in no time The house will have to go now
Too bad

Somebody in the second story is rescuing property from the devouring
element He has just tossed out a washbowl and pitcher Luckily they
both fell on the sod and rolled apart He takes down the rollershade
and flings it out The lace curtains follow They catch on the edge
of the veranda roof and languidly wave there as for some holiday
Bedclothes issue and pillows hurtle out Whats he doing now No use
No use You cant get the mattress out of that window A wastepaper
basket a rag rug a brush and combas fast as his hands can fly hes
throwing out things

The women began to whimper

Oh the poor man The roof will fall in on him Hell smother to death
Oh why doesnt somebody go tell him to come away Not you Dont you
think of such a trick Oh why does he risk his life for a lot of trash
I wouldnt have around the house

The smoke oozes out of the open window It must be choking in there
For a long time no jettison of household goods appears Perhaps the man
whoever he is has seen his peril and fled while yet it was possible to
flee Ah but suppose he has been overcome and lies there huddled in a
heap never to rouse again Is there none to save him Is there none
Ah A couple of collars and a magazine flutter out into the light He
is still there He is still alive Plague take the idiot Why doesnt he
come down out of that

Yoffemoffemoffemoffemoff Yoffemoff

But no He will do it himself The Chief rushes gallantly into the
burning building and disappears up the dark stair

Desperate measures are now to be resorted to On the lawn a line of
men forms They bend their necks cowering before the fierce glow but
daring it and prepared to face it at even closer range You are to
witness now an exhibition of that heroism which is commoner with us
than we think that spirit of do and dare which mocks at danger and
even welcomes pain It is a far finer sentiment than the coldhearted
calculation which looks ahead and figures out first whether it is worth
while or not

The men dash forward in the withering heat With frantic haste they fix
the hook into the latticework beneath the porch and scamper back

Yo hee Yo hee

The thick rope tautens as the firemen lay their weight to it You can
almost see the bristling fibers stand up on it

Yo hee Yo hee

With a splintering crash the timber parts and a piece of latticework
is dragged away

Another sortie and another Bit by bit the porch is ripped and torn to
rubbish You smile It seems so futile What are these kindlings saved
when the whole house is burning Is this what you call heroism Yet
the charge at Balaklava was not more futile It had even less of
commonsense less of hope of benefit to mankind to back it and inspire
it Heroism is an instinct not a thoughtout policy Its quality is the
same in twoounce samples or in carload lots

The weatherboarding slips down in a sparkling fall The joists and
stringers all outlined and gemmed with coals are as it were a golden
grille through which the world may look unhindered in upon the holy
place of home heretofore conventually private There stands the family
altar pitifully grotesque amid the ruinous splendor of the destroying
fire the teakettle upon it proudly flaunting its steamy plume What
Is a common cookingstove an altar Yes verily in lineal descent
Examine an ancient altar and you will see its sacrificial stone scored
and guttered to catch the dripping from the roasting meat Who is
the priestess after an order older than Melchisedecs but she that
ministers to us that most comfortable sacrament wherein we are made
partakers not alone of the outward and visible food which we do carnally
press with our teeth but also of that inward and spiritual sustenance
the patient and enduring love of wife and mother without which there
can be no such thing as home All other sacraments wherein men break
the bread of amity together are but copies of this pattern the Blessed
Sacrament of the Household Altar the first and primal one of all the
one that shall perdure please God throughout all ages of ages

The flames die down The timbers sink together with a softer fall The
air grows chill We fetch a sigh We cannot bear to look at that mute
figure of the priestess seated on the sordid heap of broken furniture
her sleeping baby pressed against her breast her gaze fixedbut
seeing naughtupon her ruined temple We do not like to think upon such
things We do not like to think at all Is there nothing more to laugh
at

The firemen having all borrowed the makings of a cigarette from each
other put on their hats and coats left on the hookandladder truck in
the custody of a trusted member The apparatus trundles off the bells
dolorously tolling as the striking gear on the rear axle engages the
cam

comfort him with All right Tom You done noble uttered in pacifying

The day before the Weekly Examiner goes to press Mr Swope hands the
editor a composition entitled A Card of Thanks signed by John K
and Amelia M Swope and addressed to the firemen and all who showed by
their many acts of kindness and so forth and so on

Kind of help to fill up the paper says Mr Swope covering his
retreat

Sure replies the editor When Mr Swope is good and gone he says
Dog my riggins if I didnt forget all about writing up that fire Been
so busy here lately Good thing he come in Hay Andy

Watch want from the composingroom

Got room for about two sticks more

Yes guess so If it dont run over that

A brief silence Then

Hay Andy

What

Is it had have or had of

Whats the connection

Whyah If the gallant fireladdies under the able direction of Chief
Charley Lomax had of had a sufficiency of water with which to cope with
the devouring elementetc

Had have I guess I dont know

Guess youre right Run it that way anyhow




CIRCUS DAY


Only the other day the man that in all this country knows better than
anybody else how a circus should be advertised said with some sadness
I do believe that it didnt pay any longer to put up showbills the
money was better invested in newspaper advertising

It doesnt pay Ah me How the commercial spirit of the age plays
whaley with the romance of existence You shall not look long upon
the showbill now that there is no money to be had from it Youths
sweetscented manuscript is about to close but ere it does let us
turn back a little to the pages illuminated by the glowing colors of the
circus poster

Saturday afternoon when we went by the enginehouse its brick wall
fluttered with the rags and tatters of Esther the Beautiful Queen
and the lecture on The Republic Will it Endure Gee But that was
exciting Sunday morning after Sundayschool there was a sudden
quickening among the boys We stopped nibbling on the edges of the
lesson leaf and followed the crowd in scuttling haste Miraculously
overnight the shabby wall had blossomed into thralling splendor What
was Daniel in the Lions Den compared with Herr Alexander in the same
Not as the prophet is pictured in the farthest corner from the lions
and manifestly saying to himself If I was only out of this But with
his head right smack dab in the lions mouth Right in it Yes sir

S Posin we gasped all goggleeyed jist sposin that there lion
was to shut his mouth Gaash

The Golden Text It faded before the lemonandscarlet glories of the
Golden Chariot Drawn by sixteen dappled steeds each with his neck
arching like a fishhook and reined with fancy scalloped reins it
occupied the center of the foreground The band rode in it far more
fortunate than our local band whose best was Charley Wellss depot
bus And nobler than all his fellows was the bassdrummer He had a
canopy over him a carved and golden canopy on whose top revolved a
clowns head with its tongue stuck out On each quarter of this rococo
shallop a golden circusgirl in short skirts gaily skipped rope with
a nubia or fascinator or whatever it is the women call the thing they
wrap around their heads in cold weather when they hang out the clothes
There were big pieces of lookingglass let into the sides of the
bandwagon and every decorator knows that when you put lookingglass on
a thing it is impossible to fix it so that it will be any finer

Winding back and forth across the picture was the long train of
tableaucars and animal cages diminishing with distance until away
way up in the upper lefthand corner the hindmost van was all immersed
in the blueandyellow haze just this side of outofsight That with
our own eyes we should behold the glories here set forth we knew right
well Cruel Fortune might cheat us of the raptures to be had inside the
tents but the streetparade was ours for it was free

It seems to me that we did not linger so long before these pictures nor
before those of the rare and costly animals which if we but knew it
were the main reason why we were permitted to go if we did get to go
To look at these animals is improving to the mind and since we could
not go alone an older person had to accompany us and and I trust
I make myself clear But we didnt want to improve our minds if it was
a possible thing to avoid it The pictures of these animals were in
the joggerfy book anyhow though not in colors unless we had a box
of paints There can be no doubt that the showbill pictures of the
menageries were in colors I seem to recollect that Mr Galbraith who
kept the drygoods store across the street from the enginehouse was
very much exercised in his mind about the way one of these pictures was
printed It was the counterfeit presentment of the Hippopotamus
or Behemoth of Holy Writ His objection to the hipyou know was not
because its open countenance was so fearsome but because it was so red
Six feet by two of flaming crimson across the street in the afternoon
sun made it necessary for him to take the goods to the back window of
the store to show to customers He didnt like it a bit

No Neither before the large and expensive pictures of the
streetparade nor the large and expensive wild beasts did we linger
The swarm was thickest sand the jabbering loudest the Ooohs the
M Lookys the Geeminentlys shrillest in front of where the deeds
of high emprise were set forth Men with their fists clenched on their
breasts and their neatly slippered toes touching the backs of their
heads crashed through papercovered hoops beneath which horses madly
coursed they flew through the air with the greatest of ease the daring
young men on the flying trapeze or they posed in living pyramids

And as the sons of men assembled themselves together Satan came also
the spirit I that evermore denies

Aaah sneers his embodiment in one whose crackling voice cannot
make up its mind whether to be bass or treble Aaah to the show they
downt do hayuf what they is in the pitchers

A chilling silence follows A cold uneasiness strikes into all the
listeners We are all made wretched by destructive criticism Let us
alone in our ideals Let us alone cant you

Now now pursues the cracklevoiced Mephisto pointing to where
Japanese jugglers defy the law of gravitation and other experiences of
daily life now they caint walk up no ladder made out o reel sharp
swords

They can so walk up it stoutly declares one boy Hurrah A champion
to the rescue The others edge closer to him They like him

Nah they caint How kin they Theyd cut their feet all to pieces

They kin so I seen em do it The time I went with Uncle George I seen
a man a Japanee Yes sharp Cut paper with em Aaah I did
so I guess I know what I seen an what I didnt

The little boys breathe easier but fearing another onslaught make all
haste to call attention to the most fascinating one of all the picture
of a little boy standing up on top of his daddys head And as if that
werent enough his daddy is standing up on a horse and the horse is
going round the ring licketysplit And as if these circumstances
werent sufficiently trying that little showboy is standing on only
one foot The other is stuck up in the air like five minutes to six and
he has hold of his toe with his hand Ill bet you cant do that just
as you are on the ground let alone on your daddys head and him on a
horse thats going like sixty Now you just try it once Just try it
Aaah Told you you couldnt

Now how the showactors can do that looks very wonderful to you It
really is very simple Ill tell you about it All showactors are born
doublejointed You have only two hipjoints They have four And its
the same all over with them Where you have only one joint they have
two So you see the wonder isnt how they can bend themselves every
which way but how they can keep from doubling up like a footrule

And another thing Every day they rub themselves all over with
snakeoil Snakes are all limber and supple and it stands to reason
that if you take and try out their oil which is their express essence
and then rub that into your skin it will make you supple and limber
too I should think gartersnakes would do all right if you could catch
enough of them but they re so awfully scarce Fishworms wont do I
tried em Theres no grease in em at all They just dry up

And I suppose you know the reason why they stay on the horses back
They have rosin on their feet Did you ever stand up on a horses back
I did It was out to grandpaps on old Tib No not very long I
didnt have any rosin on my feet I was going to put some on but my
Uncle Jimmy said Hay What you got there I told him Well he
says you jist mosey right into the house and put that back in the
fiddlebox where you got it Go on now And if I catch you foolin with
my things again Ill Well I dont know what I will do to you So
I put it back Anyhow I dont think rosin would have helped me stay on
a second longer because old Tib with an intelligence you wouldnt have
suspected in her walked under the wagonshed and calmly scraped me off
her back

And did you ever try to walk the tightrope You take the clothesline
and stretch it in the grapearborbetter not make it too high at
firstand then you take the clothesprop for a balancepole and go
right aheaderer as far as you can The real reason why you fall
off so is that you dont have chalk on your shoes Got to have lots of
chalk Then after you get used to the rope wabbling so allfired fast
you can do it like a mice And while Im about it I might as well tell
you that if you ever expect to amount to a hill of beans as a trapeze
performer you must have clearstarch with oil of cloves in it to rub on
your hands Finest thing in the world My mother wouldnt let me have
any She said she couldnt have me messing around that way I blame
her as much as anybody that I am not now a competent performer on the
trapeze

I dont know that I had better go into details about the state of mind
boys are in from the time the bills are first put up until after the
circus has actually departed I dont mean the boys that get to go to
everything that comes along and that have pennies to spend for candy
and all like that whenever they ask for it I mean the regular proper
natural boys that used to be Back Home boys whose daddies tormented
them with Well we Il see thats so exasperatingor I wish you
wouldnt tease when you know we cant spare the money just at present
A perfectly foolish answer that last They had money to fritter away at
the grocery and the butchershop and the drygoods store but when it
came to a necessity of life such as going to the circus they let on
they couldnt afford it A likely story

Only jist this little bit of a once Aw now please Please caint I
go Aw now I think you might Aw now woncha Aw paw I aint been to
a reely show for ever so long Aw the Scripture pammerammer that dont
count Aw paw Please caint I go Aw please And so forth and so on
with much more of the same sort No I cant go into details its too
terrible

Even those of us whose daddies said plainly and positively Now I
cant let you go No Willie Thats the end of it You cant go Even
those I say hoped against hope It simply could not be that what the
human heart so ardently longed for should be denied by a loving father
This same conviction applies to other things even when we are grown up
It is against nature and the constituted scheme of things that we cannot
have what we want so badly And in general it may be said that we can
have almost anything we want if we only want it hard enough Thats the
trouble with us We dont want it hard enough We boys lay there in
the shade and pulled the long stalks of grass and nibbled off the sweet
yellow ends as we dramatized miracles that could happen just as well as
not if they only would consarn em For instance you might be going
along the street not thinking of anything but how much you wanted to go
to the circus and how sorry you were because you hadnt the money and
your daddy wouldnt give you any and first thing you d know you d
stub your toe on something and youd look down and thered be a half a
dollar that somebody had lostGee If it would only be that way But we
knew it wouldnt because only the other Sunday Brother Longenecker had
said The age of miracles is past So we had to give up all hopes Oh
its terrible Just terrible

But some of the boys lay there in the grass with their hands under their
heads looking up at the sky and making little white spots come in and
out on the corners of their jaws they had their teeth set so hard
and were chewing so fiercely You could almost hear their minds creak
scheming scheming scheming I suppose there were ways for boys to make
money in those times but they always fizzled out when you came to try
them to say nothing of the way they broke into your day Why you had
scarcely any time to play in You d go round to some neighbors house
with a magazine and youd say Good afternoon Mrs Slaymaker Do you
want to subscribe for this Just the way you had studied out you would
say And shed take it and go sit down with it and read it clear
through while you played with the dog and then when she got all through
with it and had read all the advertisements shed hand it back to you
and say No she didnt believe she would They had so many books and
papers now that she didnt get a chance hardly to read in any of them
let alone taking any new ornes Were you getting many new subscribers
Just commenced eh Well she wished you all the luck in the world
How was your ma Thats good Did she hear from your Uncle Johns folks
since they moved out to Kansas

I have heard that there were boys who under the dire necessity of going
to the circus got together enough rags old iron and bottles to make
up the price sold em collected the money and went I dont believe
it I dont believe it We all had hidden under the back porch our
treasureheap of rusty grates cracked firepots broken griddles and
lidlifters tubhoops and pokers but I do not believe that any human
boy ever collected fifty cents worth I want you to understand that
fifty cents is a whole lot of money particularly when it is laid out in
scrapiron Only the tinwagon takes rags and they pay in tinware
and thats no good to a boy that wants to go to the circus And as for
bottleswell sir you wash out a whole whole lot of bottles a whole
big lot of em a washbasket full and tote em down to Mr Cases
drugand bookstore as much as ever you and your brother can wag and
see what he gives you Its simply scandalous You have no idea of how
mean and stingy a man can be until you try to sell him old bottles And
the coldhearted way in which he will throw back inkbottles that you
worked so hard to clean and the ones that have reading blown into the
glassOh its enough to set you against business transactions all
your life long Theres something about bargain and sale thats mean and
censorious finding this fault and finding that fault and paying just
as little as ever they can It gets on ones nerves It really does

The boys that made the little white spots come on the corners of their
jaws as they lay there in the grass scheming scheming scheming
planned rags and bottles and scrapiron and more also Sometimes it
was a plan so much bigger that if they had kept it to themselves like
the darkeys cow they would have all swole up and died

you and me get up early and go see the circus come in town will you I
will if you will All right Remember now Dont you tell anybody what
I told you You know


If a fellow just only could run off with a circus Wouldnt it be great
No more splitting kindling and carrying in coal no more Hurry up
now or youll be late for school no more poking along in a humdrum
existence never going any place or seeing anything but the glad
free untrammeled life the life of a circusboy standing up on top of
somebodys head you could pretend he was your daddy Whod ever know
the difference and your leg stuck up like five minutes to six and him
standing on top of a horseand the horse going around the ring and the
ring master cracking his whipaw say How about it

Maybe the showpeople would take you even if you didnt have two joints
to common folks one and hadnt had early advantages in the way of
plenty of snakes to try the grease out of And then and then
Travel all around and be in a new town every day And see things The
waterworks and Main Street and the Soldiers Monument and the Second
Presbyterian Church All the sights there are to see in strange places
And then when the show came back to your own hometown next year people
would wonder whose was that slim and gracile figure in the green silk
tights and spangled breechclout that capered so nimbly on the bounding
coursers back that switched the natty switch and shrilly called out
Hep Hep Theyd screw up their eyes to look hard and theyd say
Yes sir It is Its him Its Willie Bigelow Well of all things
And theyd clap their hands and be so proud of you And theyd wonder
how it was that they could have been so blind to your many merits when
they had you with them Theyd feel sorry that they ever said you were
a regular little imp if ever there was one and that you had the Old
Boy in you as big as a horse Theyd feel ashamed of themselves so they
would And theyd come and apologize to you for the way they had acted
and youd say Oh thats all right Forgive and forget And theyd
miss you at home too Your daddy would wish he hadnt whaled you the
way he did just for nothing at all And your mother too shed be
sorry for the way she acted to you tormenting the life and soul out of
you sending you on errands just when you got a man in the king row and
making you wash your feet in a bucket before you went to bed instead of
being satisfied to let you pump on them as any reasonable mother would
Shell think about that when youre gone Itll be lonesome then with
nobody to bang the doors and upset the creampitcher on the clean
tablecloth and fall over backward in the rockingchair and break a
rocker off Your daddy will sigh and say

I wonder where Willie is tonight Poor boy I sometimes fear I was too
harsh with him And your mother will try to keep back her tears but
she cant and first thing she knows shell burst out crying and
and and old Maje will go around the house looking for you and
whining because he cant find his little playmate It will seem as if
you were deaddead to them and Smf Smf

Confound that orchestra leader anyhow How many times have I got to
tell him that this is the musiccue for Where is My Wandering Boy
Tonight

We were all going to get up early enough to see the show come in at the
depot Very few of us did it Somehow we couldnt seem to wake up Here
and there a hardy spirit compasses the feat

All the town is asleep when this boy slips out of his frontgate and
snicks the latch behind him softly It is very still so still that
though he is more than a mile away from the railroad he can hear Johnny
Mara the night yardmaster bawl out Run them three empties over on
Number Four track the short exhaust of the obedient ponyengine and
the succeeding crash of the cars as they bump against their fellows It
is very still scarey still The gaslamp flaring and flickering among
the green maples at the corner has a strange look to him His footfalls
on the sidewalk sound so loud he takes the soft middle of the dusty
road He hears some one pursuing him and his bosom contracts with fear
as he stands to see who it is Although he hardly knows the boy bound on
the same errand as his he takes him to his heart as a chosen friend
They are kin

On the freighthouse platform they find other boys Some of them have
waited up all night so as not to miss it They are from across the
tracks They have all the fun those fellows do They can swear and chew
tobacco and play hookey from school and have a good time They get
to go barefoot before anybody else and nobody tells them it will thin
their blood to go in swimming so much Yes and they can fight too
Theyd sooner fight than eat Our boys conscious of inferiority keep
to themselves The boys from across the tracks show off all the bad
words they can think of One of them has a mouthharp which he plays
upon now and then opening his hands hollowed around the instrument
Patsy Gubbins dances to the music which is a thing even more reckless
and daredevil than swearing Patsys going with a troupe some day Or
else hes going to get a job firing on an engine He isnt right sure
which he wants to do the most

Now and then a brakeman goes by swinging his lantern The boys would
like to ask him what time it is but for one thing theyre too bashful
Being a brakeman is almost as good as going with a troupe or a circus
You get to go to places that way too Marysville and Mechanicsburg
and Harrodsthat is if youre on the local freight and then you lay
over in Cincinnati Some ways its better than firing and some ways it
isnt so good And then there is another reason why they dont ask
the brakeman what time it is Hed say it was fortyfive or maybe
fiftythree and never tell what hour

Say Do you know its cold You wouldnt think it would be so cold in
the summertime

The mapletrees from being formless blobs insensibly begin to look
like lacework Presently the heavens and the earth are bathed in liquid
blue that casts a spell so potent on the soul of him that sees it that
he yearns for something he knows not what except that it is utterly
beyond him as far beyond him as what he means to be will be from what
he shall attain to One dreams of romance and renown of all that should
be and is not And as he dreams the birds awaken In the East there
comes a greenish tinge Far up the track there is a sullen roar and
then the hoarse diapason of an engine whistle The roar strengthens and
strengthens It is the circus train

Under the witchcraft of the dreaming blue each boy had a firm and
stubborn purpose Over and over again he rehearsed how he would go up
to the man that runs the show and say Please mister can I go with
you And the man would say Yes As easy as that But the purpose
wavered as he saw the roustabouts come tumbling out all frowsy and
unwashed rubbing the sleep out of their eyes cross and savage And the
man whose word they jump to obey hes kind of discouraging its all
business with him The fellows may plead with their eyes he never sees
them If he does he tells them where to get to out of that and how
quick he wants it done in language that makes the boldest efforts of
the boys from across the tracks seem puny in comparison The lads
divide into two parties One follows the buggy of the boss canvasman to
Vandemans lots where the stand is made They will witness the spectacle
of the raising of the tents but they will also be near the man that
runs the show and if all goes well it may be he will like your looks
and saunter up to you and say Well bub and how would you like to
travel with us You dont know Things not half so strange as that have
happened And if you were right there at the time

The other party lingers awhile looking up wistfully at the unresponsive
windows of the sleepingcars behind which are the happy circusactors
Perhaps the showboy that stands up on top of his daddys head will look
out If he should raise the window and smile at you and get to talking
with you maybe he would introduce you to his pa and tell him that you
would like to go with the show and his pa would be a nice sort of a
man and hed say Why yes I guess we can fix that all right And
there youd be

Or if it didnt come out like that why maybe the boy would be another
Little Arthur the Boy Circusrider like it told about in he Ladies
Repository It seems there was a man and one day he went by where there
was a circus and in a quiet secluded vineclad nook only a few
steps from the main tent he heard somebody sigh oh so sadly and so
pitifully Come to find out it was Little Arthur the Boy Circusrider
He had large sensitive violet eyes and a wealth of clustering ringlets
and he was very very unhappy So the man took from his pocket a Bible
that he happened to have with him and he read from it to Little Arthur
which cheered him up right away because up to that moment he had only
heard of the Bible Think of that And that night at the show what do
you spose Little Arthur fell off the horse and hurt himself And this
man was at the show and he went back in the dressingroom and held
Little Arthurs hand And the clown was crying and the actors were
crying for they all loved Little Arthur in their rude untutored way
And Little Arthur opened his large sensitive violet eyes and saw the
man and said off the text that the man taught him that afternoon

And then he died It was a sad story but it made you wish it had been
you that happened to have a Bible in your pocket as you passed the
secluded vineclad nook only a few paces from the main tent and had
heard Little Arthur sigh so pitifully It was those sensitive eyes we
looked for in the sleepingcar windows and all in vain I think I saw
the wealth of clustering ringlets or at least the makings of it I
am almost positive I saw curlpapers as the curtain was drawn aside a
moment

But whether a boy stands gazing at the sleepers or runs over to the
lots there is something pathetic about it something almost terrible
It is the death of an ideal I cant conceive of a boy coming down to
the depot to see the circus train come in another time Hitherto the
show has been to him the ne plus ultra of romance It comes in the night
from way off yonder it goes in the night to way off yonder It is all
splendor all deeds of high emprise It stands to reason then that the
closer you get to it the closer you get to pure romance And it isnt
that way at all

What gravels a boy the most of all is to have to do the same old thing
over and over again day after day week in week out Once he has seen
the circus come in he cannot blind himself to the fact that everything
is marked and numbered that all is system and that everything is done
today exactly as it was done yesterday and as it will be done tomorrow

What town is this he hears a man inquire of another

Blest if I know Whats the odds what town it is

Didnt know what town it was Didnt care

The keen morning air or something makes a fellow mighty unromantic
too Perhaps it was the thin blue woodsmoke from the fieldstoves and
the smell of the hot coffee and the victuals the waiters are carrying
about some to the tent where the bare tables are for the canvasmen
some to the table covered with a red and white tablecloth as befits
performers These have no rosy cheeks Their lithe limbs are not richly
decked with silken tights Insensibly the upper lip curls Theyre not
so much Theyre only folks Thats all just folks

But when ideals die great truths are born To such a boy at such a
moment there comes the firm conviction which increasing years can only
emphasize Home is but a poor prosaic place but HomeAh my brother
think on thisHome is where Breakfast is

Hay Wait for me you fellows Hay Hold on a minute Well aint I
acomin jiss fasts ever I kin Whats your rush

It is the exceptional boy has this experience The normal one preserves
the delicate bloom of romance by never seeing the show until it makes
its Grand Triumphal Entree in a Pageant of Unparalleled Magnificence far
Surpassing the Pomp and Splendor of Oriental Potentates

The hitchingposts are full of whinnering country horses and people are
in town you wouldnt think existed if you hadnt seen their pictures in
Puck and Yudge people from over by Muchinippi and out Noodletoozy way
big rednecked men with the long loping step that comes from walking on
the plowed ground Following them are lanky women with their front teeth
gone and their figures bowed by drudgery dragging wideeyed children
whose uncouth finery betrays the country jake even if the freckles
and the sunbleached hair could keep the secret From the faroff
fastnesses where there are still logcabins chinked with mud they have
ventured to see the show come into town and when they have seen that
they will retire again beyond our ken How every sense is numbed and
stunned by the magnificence and splendor of the painted and gilded
wagons as they rumble past the driver rolling and pitching in his seat
as he handles the ribbons of eight horses all at once The farmers
heart is filled with admiration of his craft as much as the childrens
hearts are at the gaudy pictures

The allegorical tableaucar solemnly waggles past Europe and Asia and
Africa and Australia brilliant in greasepaint and gorgeous cheesecloth
robes And can you guess who the fat lady is up on the very tiptop of
all on the tiptop where the wobble is the worst Our own Columbia
It must be fine to ride around that way all dressed up in a flag But
a sourer lot of faces you never saw in your life No I am wrong For
downright melancholy and despondency you must wait till the funny old
clown comes along in his little bit of a buggy drawn by a little bit of
a donkey

And oh looky Here comes the elephants just the same as in the
joggerfy books And see the men walking beside them They come from the
place the elephants do See they have on the clothes they wear in that
country Dont they look proud Who wouldnt be proud to get to walk
with an elephant And if you ever do anything to an elephant to make him
mad hell always remember it and some day hell get even with you
One time there was a man and he gave an elephant a chew of tobacco
andOoooh See that man in the cage with the lions Dont it just
make the cold chills run over you I wouldnt be there for a million
dollars would you ma

What they laughing at down the street Ma make Lizzie get down shes
right in my way I dont want to see it pretty soon I want to see it
naow Oh aint it funny See the old clowns playing on horns Aint it
too killing Aw look at them ponies I woosht I had one Johnny Pym
has got a goat he can hitch up What was that pa What was that went
OoOOoohm

Whoa Nell whoa there Steady gal steaday Ho there Ho
Whoawhoahup Whad dy y about Fool horse Whoa whoa so gal
sooo Lion I guess or a tagger or sumpum or other

And talk about music You thought the band was grand You just wait
Dont you hear it down the street Itll be along in a minute now

There it is Thats the callyope Thats what the show bills call
The Steam Car of the Muses Mmwell I dont know but it is just a
leetle off the pitch especially towards the end of a note but you
must remember that you cant haul a very big boiler on a wagon and the
whistles let out an awful lot of steam Its pretty hard to keep the
pressure even But its loud Thats the main thing And the man that
plays on itno not that fellow in the overalls with a wad of greasy
waste in his hand He s only the engineer I mean the artist the man
that plays on the keys Well he knows what the people want He has
his fingers on the public pulse Does he give them a Bach fugue or
Guillmants Grand Choeur Deed he doesnt He goes right to the
heart with Patricks Day in the Morning and The Carnival of
Venice and Home Sweet Home and Oh Where Oh Where has my Little
Dog Gone He knows his business A shade off the key perhaps but my
Aint it grand So loud and nice

Well thats all of it Why child I cant make it any longer than
it is

What do you want me to drive round into the other street for Youve
seen all there is to see Got all your trading done mother Well then
I expect wed better put for home Now Eddy I told you No once and
thats the end of it Hush up now Look here sir Do you want me to
take and tend to you right before everybody Well I will now if I
hear another whimper out o ye Ckckck Git ep there Nelly

Some day when we get big and have whole whole lots of money were
going to the circus every time it comes to town to the real circus the
one you have to pay to get into For if merely the street parade is so
magnificent what must the show itself be

How people can sit at the table on circus day and stuff and stuff the
way they do is more than I can understand Youd think they hadnt any
more chances to eat than they had to go to the show And they can find
more things to do before they get started And then after the house
is all locked up and everything theyve got to go back after a
handkerchief What does anybody want with a handkerchief at a circus

Its exasperating enough to have to choose between going in the
afternoon and not going at all Why sure its finer at night Lots
finer You know that kind of a light the peanutroaster man has got
down by the postoffice Burns that kind of stuff they use to take out
greasespots Yeah Gasoline Well at the circus at night they dont
have just one light like that but bunches and bunches of them on the
tentpoles No silly Of course not Of course they dont set the tent
afire But say What if they did eh The place would be all full
of people laughing at the country jake that comes out to ride the
trickmule and youd happen to look up and see where the canvas was
juuust beginning to blaze and youd jump up and holler Fire Fire
as loud as ever you could because you saw it first and youd point to
the place Excitement Well I guess yes The people would all run every
which way and fall all over themselves and the women would squealAnd
do you know what Id do Wouldnt just let myself down between the kind
of bedslat benches and drop to the ground and lift up the canvas and
there Id be all safe And after I was all safe then Id go back and
rescue folks

Weell I spose Id have to rescue a girl It seems they always do
that But it would be nicer I think to rescue some real rich man Hed
say My noble preserver How can I sufficiently reward you and take
out his pocketbook And wouldnt say Take back your proffered gold
and make like I was pushing it away take back your proffered gold I
but did my duty And then wouldnt forget all about it And one day
after Id forgotten all about it the man would die and will me a
million dollars or a thousand I dont know Enough to make me rich

And say Wouldnt the animals get excited when they saw the show was
afire Theyd just roar and roar and upset the cages and maybe theyd
get loose OooOh How about that If there was a lion come at me Id
climb a tree What would you do Ah your pas shotgun nothing Why
you crazy that would only infuriate him the more What you want to do
is to take an express rifle like Doo Challoo did and aim right for his
heart An express rifle is what you send off and get and they ship it
to you by express

So you see what a fellow misses by having to go to the show in the
afternoon like the girls and the ababs The boys from across the
tracks get to go at night They have all the fun When they go they
dont have to poke along and poke along and keep hold of hands so as
not to get lost Aw hurry up cant you Dont you hear the band
playing Itll be all over before we get there

But finally the lots are reached and there are the tents with all
kinds of flags snapping from the centerpoles and the guyropes And
there are the sideshows Alas You never thought of the sideshows when
you asked if you could go And now its too late It must be fine in the
sideshows I never got to go to one I didnt have the money But if
the big painted banners bulging in and out as the wind plays with
them are anything to go by it must be something grand to see the Fat
Lady and the Circassian Beauty whose frizzled head will just about fit
a bushel basket and the Armless Wonder They say he can take a pair of
scissors with his toes and cut your picture out of paper just elegant

Oh and something else you miss by going in the afternoon At night you
can sneak around at the back and when nobody is looking you can just
lift up the canvas and go right in for nothing Why whats wrong
about that Ah youre too particular And if the canvasman catches
you you can commence to cry and say you had only forty cents and
wanted to see the circus so bad and hell take it and let you in
and you can have ten cents dont you see to spend for lemonade
red lemonade you understand and peanuts the littlest bags and the
onriest peanuts that ever were

As far as I can see the animal part of the show is just the same as it
always was The people that take you to the show always pretend to be
interested in them but its my belief they stop and look only to tease
you Away way back in ancient times there used to be a man that took
the folks around and told them what was in each cage and where it came
from and how much it cost and what useful purpose it served in the
wise economy of nature and all about it That was before my time But
I can recollect something they had that they dont have any more I can
remember when Mr Barnum first brought his show to our town It didnt
take much teasing to get to go to that because in those days Mr Barnum
was a biger man than old Grant The Life of P T Barnum Written by
Himself was on everybodys marbletopped centertable just the same as
The History of the Great Rebellion You show some elderly person from
out of town the church across the street from the Astor House and
say Thats St Pauls Chapel General Montgomerys monument is in the
chancel window George Washington went to meeting there the day he was
inaugurated president and your friend will say Mhm But you tell
him that right across Broadway is where Barnums Museum used to be and
hell brighten right up and remember all about how Barnum strung a
flag across to St Pauls steeple and what a fuss the vestry of Trinity
Parish made Thats something he knows about thats part of the history
of our country

Well when Mr Barnum first came to our town all around one tent were
vans full of the very identical Moral Waxworks that we had read about
and had given up all hopes of ever seeing because New York was so far
away There was the Dying Zouave Oh that was a beauty The Advance
Courier said that the crimson torrent of his hearts blood spouted in
rhythmic jets as the tide of life ebbed silently away but I guess by
the time they got to our town they must have run all out of pokeberry
juice for the crimson torrent didnt spout at all But his bosom
heaved every so often and he rolled up his eyes something grand I
liked it but my mother said it was horrid Thats the way with women
They dont like anything that anybody else does Theres no pleasing
em And she thought the Drunkards Family was kind o low It wasnt
either It was fine and taught a great moral lesson I told her so but
she said it was low just the same She thought the Temperance Family
was nice but it wasnt anywhere near as good as the Drunkards Family
Why let me tell you The Drunkards Wife was in a ragged calico dress
and her eye was all black and blue where he had hit her the week
before And the Drunkard had hold of a black quart bottle and his nose
was all red and he wore a plug hat that was even rustier and more caved
in than Elder Drowns if such a thing were possible And there wasBut
I cant begin to tell you of all the fine things Mr Barnum had that
year but never had again

Another thing Mr Barnum had that year that never appeared again It
may be that after that time the Funny Old Clown did crack a joke but
I never heard him The one that Mr Barnum had got off the most comical
thing you ever heard Ill never forget it the longest day I live
Laugh Why I nearly took a conniption over it It seems the clown got
to crying about something Now what was it made him cry Let me see
now Aint it queer I cant remember that Fudge Well never mind
now It will come to me in a minute

I feel kind of sorry for the poor little young ones that grow up and
never know what a clown is like Oh yes they have them today after a
fashion They stub their toes and fall down the same as ever but there
is a whole mob of them and you cant take the interest in them that you
could in the one the only the inimitable clown there used to be a
character of such importance that he got his name on the bills He was a
mighty man in those days The ringmaster was a kind of stuckup fellow
very important in his own estimation but he didnt have a spark of
humor Not a spark And hed be swelling around there all so grand
and the clown just to take him down a peg or two would ask him a
conundrum And do you think he could ever guess one Never Not a one
And when the clown would tell him what the answer was hed be so vexed
at himself that hed try to take it out on the poor clown and cut at
him with his long whip But Mr Clown was just as spry in his shoes as
he was under the hat and hed hop up on the ringside out of the way
and squall out Aaaah Never touched me We had that for a byword
Oh youd die laughing at the comical remarks hed make And hed be so
quick about it The ringmaster would say something and before youd
think the clown would make a joke out of it I wish I could remember
what it was he said that was so funny the time he started crying Seems
to me it was something about his little brother Well no matter

Yes sir there are heads of families today Ill bet you that have
grown up without ever having heard a clown sing a comic song and ask
the audience to join in the chorus And if you say to such people Here
we are again Mr Merryman or Bring on another horse or What will
the little lady have now the banners my lord they look at you so
funny They dont know what you mean and they dont know whether to get
huffy or not Well I suppose it had to be that the Funny Old Clown with
all his songs and quips and conundrums and comical remarks should
disappear Perhaps he didnt pay

I cant see that the rest of the show has changed so very much Perhaps
the trapeze performances are more marvelous and breathsuspending than
they used to be But they were far and far beyond what we could dream of
then and to go still farther as little impresses us as to be told that
people live still even westerly of Idaho The trapeze performers are
uptodate in one respect The fellow that comes down with his arms
folded one leg stuck out and the other twined around the big rope
revolving slowly slowlywell the band plays the Intermezzo from
Cavalleria Rusticana nowadays when he does that It used to play O
Thou Sweet Spirit Hear my Prayer But the lady in the ridinghabit
still smiles as if it hurt her when her horse walks on its hind legs
the bareback rider does the very same fancy steps as the horse goes
round the ring in a rockingchair lope the attendants still slant the
hurdles almost flat for the horse to jump they still snake the banners
under the riders feet as he gives a little hop up and they still bang
him on the head with the papercovered hoop to  Hold on a minute
Now

Now That story the clown told that was so funny that had something
to do with those hoops I wish I could think of it It would make you
laugh I know

People try to lay the blame of the modern circuss failure to interest
them on the three rings They say so many things to watch at once keeps
them from being watching properly any one act They cant give it the
attention it deserves But Ill tell you whats wrong There isnt any
Funny Old Clown a particular one to give it human interest It is
all too splendid too magnificent too far beyond us We want to hear
somebody talk once in awhile

They pretended that the tent was too big for the clown to be heard but
I take notice it wasnt too big for the fellow to get up and declaim
The puffawmance ees not yait hawf ovah The jaintlemanly agents will
now pawss around the ring with tickets faw the concert I used to hate
that man When he said the performance was not yet half over he lied
like a dog consarn his picture There were only a few more acts to
come He knew it and we knew it We wanted the show to go on and on and
always to be just as exciting as at the very first and it wouldnt
We had got to the point where we couldnt be interested in anything any
more We were as little ones unable to prop their eyelids open and yet
quarreling with bed We were surfeited but not satisfied We sat there
and pouted because there wasnt any more and yet we couldnt but yawn
at the act before us We were mad at ourselves and mad at everybody
else We clambered down the rattling bedslats seats sour and sullen
We didnt want to look at the animals we didnt want to do this and
we didnt want to do that We whined and snarled and wriggled and shook
ourselves with temper and we got a good hard slap side of the head
right before everybody and then we yelled as if we were being killed
alive

Now mister if I ever take you any place again youll know it Id
be ashamed of myself if I was you Hush up Hush up I tell you Now
you mark Youre never going to the show again Do you hear me Never I
mean it Youre never going again

But at eventide there was light After supper after a little rest and
a good deal of food while chopping the kindling for morning its
wonderful how useful employ tends to induce a cheerful view of life
out of her dazzling treasureheap of jewels Memory took up one after
another a glowing recollection and viewed it with delight The evening
performance the one all lighted up with bunches and bunches of lights
was apreparing and in the gentle breeze the faroff music waved as it
had been a flag A harsh and rumbling noise as of heavy timbers falling
tore through the tissue of sweet sounds The horses in the barn next
door screamed in their stalls to hear it Ages and ages ago on distant
windswept plains their ancestors had hearkened to that huntingcry and
summoned up their valor and their speed It still thrilled in the blood
of these patient slaves of man though countless generations of them had
never even so much as seen a lion

And is that all the difference pa that the lion roars at night and
the ostrich in the daytime

Out on the back porch in the deepening dusk we sat with eyes relaxed
and dreaming and watched the stars that powdered the dark sky Before
our inward vision passed in review the day of splendor and renown We
sighed at last but it was the happy sigh of him who has full dined
Ambition was digesting In our turn when we grew up we too were to
do the deeds of high emprise We were to be somebody

I never heard of anybody sitting up to see the show depart And yet it
seems to me that would be the best time to run off with it

The next day we visited the lots It was no dream See the litter that
mussed up the place

We were all there None had heard the man that runs the show say
genially Yes I think we can arrange to take you with us Here was
the ring here the tentpole holes and here a scrap of paper torn from
a hoop the bareback rider leaped through Oh now I know what I was
going to tell you that the clown said The comicalest thing

He picked up one of these hoops and began to sniffle

So the ringmaster asked him what he was crying about

IIwas thinking of my mother Smf My good old mother

So the ringmaster asked him what made him think of his mother

This And he held up the papercovered hoop

The ringmaster couldnt see how that put the clown in mind of his
mother He was awful dumb that man

It looks just like the pancakes she used to make for us

Well sir we just hollered and laughed at that And after we had
quieted down a little the ringmaster says As big as that

Bigger says the clown Why she used to make em so big we used em
for bedclothes

Indeed Just like that He took it all in just as if it was so

Oh my yes I mind one time I was sleeping with my little brother and
I waked up just as coldBrr But I was cold

But how could that be sir You just now said you had pancakes for
bedclothes

Yes but my little brother got hungry in the night and et up all the
cover

Laugh Why they screamed Me I thought Id just about go up But the
ring master never cracked a smile He didnt see the joke at all

Goodby old clown friend of our childhood goodby goodby forever
And you our other friend the street parade must you go too And you
the gorgeous showbills must you tread the path toward the sundown
Goodby Goodby In that dreary land where you are going the Kingdom
of the Ausgespielt it may comfort you to recollect the young hearts you
have made happy in the days that were but never more can be again




THE COUNTY FAIR


Whether or not the name had an influence on the weather I dont know
Perhaps it did rain some years but as I remember County Fair time
seems to have had a sky perfectly cloudless with its blue only a little
dulled around the edges where it came close to the ground and the dust
settled on it Things far off were sort of hazy but that might have
been the result of the bonfires of leaves we had been having evenings
after supper In Fair weather when the sun had been up long enough
to get a really good start it was right warm but in the shade it
was cool and nights and mornings there was a chill in the air that
threatened worse things to come

The harvest is past the summer is ended Down cellar the swingshelf is
cramjam full of jellyglasses and jars of fruit Out on the henhouse
roof are drying what when the soapbox wagon was first built promised
barrels and barrels of nuts to be brought up with the pitcher of cider
for our comforting in the long winter evenings but what turns out when
the shucks are off to be a poor pitiful halfpeck daily depleted by
the urgent necessity of finding out if they are dry enough yet Folks
are picking apples and Koontzs cidermill is in full operation Do
you know any place where a fellow can get some nice long straws Out in
the fields are champagnecolored pyramids each with a palegold heap
of corn beside it and the good black earth is dotted with orange blobs
that promise pumpkinpies for Thanksgiving Day No Let me look again
Those arent piepumpkins those are cowpumpkins and if you want to
see something kind of pitiful Ill show you Abe Bethard chopping up
one of those yellow globeswith what do you suppose With the cavalry
saber his daddy used at Gettysburg

The harvest is past the summer is ended As a result of all the good
feeding and the outdoor air we have had for three or four months past
the strawberry shortcakes and cherrypies and green peas and
new potatoes and string beans and roastingears and all such
gardenstuff and the fresh eggs broken into the skillet before Speckle
gets done cackling and the cockerels we pick off the roost Saturday
evenings you see were thinning em out no sense in keeping all of
em over winteras a result I say of all this good eating and the
outdoor life and the necessity of stirring around a little lively these
days we feel pretty good And yet we get kind of low in our minds too
The harvest is past the summer is ended Its gone the good playtime
when we didnt have to go to school when the only footcovering we wore
was a rag around one big toe or the other the days when we could stay
in swimming all day long except mealtimes the days of Sabbathschool
picnics and excursions to the Soldiers Homeits gone The harvest
is past the summer is ended The green and leafy things have heard the
word and most of them are taking it pretty seriously judging by their
looks But the maples and some more of them particularly the maples
with daredevil recklessness have resolved as it were to die with
their boots on and flame out in such violent and unbelievable colors
that we feel obliged to take testimony in certain outrageous cases
and file away the exhibits in the Family Bible where nobody will bother
them The harvest is past the summer is ended Rainy days you can see
how playedout and forlorn the whole world looks But at Fair time when
the sun shines bright it appears right cheerful

It seems to me the Fair lasted three days One of them was a holiday
from school I know and unless Im wrong it wasnt on the first day
because then they were getting the things in and it wasnt on the last
day because then they were taking the things out so it must have been
on the middle day when everybody went Charley Wells had both the depot
buses out with County FAIR painted on muslin hung on the sides The
Cornet Band rode all round town in one and so on over to the scene of
the festivities as the Weekly Examiner very aptly put it and then both
buses stood out in front of the American House waiting for passengers
with Dinny Enright calling out This sway t the Fair Grouns Going
RIGHT over Only he always waited till he got a good load before he
turned a wheel Dinnys foreman at the chair factory now Did you know
that Doing fine Gets 15 a week and hasnt drunk a drop for nearly
two years

Everybody goes the middle day of the Fair everybody that you ever did
know or hear tell of Youll be going along kind of halflistening to
the man selling Temperance Bitters and denouncing the other bitters
because they have alcuehawl in them and alcuehawl will make you
drunk which is perfectly true and kind of halflistening to the man
with the electric machine declaring Ground is the first conductor
water is the second conductor and youll be thinking how slippery the
grass is to walk on when a face in the crowd will as it were sting
your memory I ought to know that man says you to yourself Now who
the mischief is he Barker No t isnt Barker Barkdull No Funny
I cant think of his name Begins with B Im pretty certain And you
trail along after him as if you were a detective sort of keeping out
of his sight and yet every once in a while getting a good look at him
Mmmmmm says you What is that fellows name Why sure McConica
And you walk up to him and stick out your hand while hes gassing with
somebody and theres that smile on your face that says I know you
but you dont know me and he takes it in a limp sort of fashion and
starts to say You have the advantage of when all of a sudden he
grabs your hand as if he were going to jerk your arm out of its socket
and beat you over the head with the bloody end and shouts out Why
HELLO Billy Well suffering Cyrus and all hands round Hold still a
second and let me look at you Gosh darn your hide where you been for
so long I though youd clean evaporated off the face the earth Why
how AIR you Hows everything Thats good Let me make you acquainted
with my wife Molly this is Mr But she says Now dont you tell me
what his name is Let me think Why Willie Smith Well of all things
Why how youve changed Honest I wouldnt have knowed you Do you mind
the time we went sleighridin the whole posse of us and got upset down
there by Hankss place And then you start in on D you mind and
Dont you recollect and you talk about the old schooldays and whos
married and whos moved out to Kansas and whos got the Elias Hoover
place now and how Ella TrimbleYou know Ella Diefenbaugh old Jake
Diefenbaughs daughter the one that lisped Course you do Well she
married Ed Trimble and he died along in the early part of the summer
Typhoid Was getting well but he took a relapse and went off like that
And now shes left with three little ones and they guess poor Ella has
a pretty hard time making out And this old schoolmate that you start
to tell a funny story about is dead and the frecklefaced boy with the
buck teeth that put the rabbit in the teachers desk hes dead too
and the boy that used to cry in school when they read

 Give me three grains of corn mother
 Only three grains o f corn
 To save what little life I have mother
 Till the coming o f the morn

well he studied law with old judge Rodehaver and got to be Prosecuting
Attorney but he took to drinkingpolitics you knowand now hes just
gone to the dogs Smart as a steeltrap and bright as a dollar Oh a
terrible pity A terrible pity And as you hear the fate of one after
another of the happy companions of your childhood and the sadness of
life comes over you they start to tell something that makes you laugh
again I tell you Did you ever see one of these concave glasses such
as the artists use when they want to get an idea of how a picture looks
all together as a whole and not as an assemblage of parts Well what
the concave glass is to a picture so such talk is to life It sort of
draws it all together and you see it as a whole its sunshine and its
shadow its laughter and its tears its work and its play its past and
its present But not its future The Good Man has mercifully hidden that
from us

It does a body good to get such a talk once in a while

And there are the young fellows and the girls This young gentleman in
the rimless eyeglasses who is now beginning to go out among em the
last time you saw him was in meeting when Elder Drown was preaching and
my gentleman stood up in the seat and shouted shrilly T aint at all
man T aint at all And this sweet girlgraduatethe last time you
saw her was just after Becky Daly in the vain effort to peacify the
squalling young one had given her a fresh egg to play with I kind
o like the looks of the younger generation of girls But I dont know
about the young fellows They look to me like a trifling lot Nothing
like what they were in our young days I dont see but what us old
codgers had better hold on a while longer to the County Clerks office
and the Sheriffs office and the Probate judgeship and the presidency
of the National Bank It wouldnt be safe to trust the destinies of
the country in the hands of such heedless young whiffets Engaged to be
married Oh get out What Those babies

I kept awake most of the time the man was lecturing on The Republic
Will it Endure but I dont remember that he said anything in it about
the crops We cant go round meeting the folks all day We really must
give a glance at the exhibition And I am one of those who hold to the
belief that while the farmers can raise ears of corn as long as from
your elbow to your fingertips as big round as a rollingpin and set
with grains as regular and even as an eightdollar set of artificial
teeth as long as they grow potatoes the size of your foot and such
pretty oats and wheat and turnips and squashes and onions and apples
and all kinds of truck and raise them not only in increasing size but
increasing quantities to the acre I feel as if the Republic would last
the year out anyway Not that I have any notion that mere material
prosperity will make and keep us a free people but it goes to show that
the farmers are not plodding along doing as their fathers did before
them but that they are reading and studying and taking advantage of
modern methods There are two ways of increasing your income One is by
enlarging your output and the other is by enlarging your share of the
proceeds from the sale of that output The Grand Dukes will not always
run this country The farmers saved the Union once by dying for it
they will save it again by living for it

The scientific fellows tell us that we have not nearly reached the
maximum of yield to the acre of crops that are harvested once a year
but in regard to the crops that are harvested twice a day it looks to me
as if we were doing fairly well Nowadays we hardly know what is meant
by the expression Spring poor It is a sinister phrase and tells
a story of the old cruel days when farmers begrudged their cattle the
little bite they ate in wintertime so that when the grass came again
the poor creatures would fall over trying to crop it They were so
starved and weak that as the saying went they had to lean up against
the fence to breathe They dont do that way now as one look at the
fine sleek cows will show you A cow these days is a different sort of
a being her coat like satin and her udder generous compared with the
wildeyed things with burrs in their tails and their flanks crusted
with filth their udders the size of a kid glove and yielding such a
little dab of milk and for such a short period Hear the dairymen boast
now of the miraculous yearly yield in pounds of butter and milk and
when they say Youve got to treat a cow as if she were a lady it
sounds like good sense

Pigs are naturally so untidy about their persons and have such shocking
tablemanners that it seems difficult to treat a sow like a lady but
that one in the pen yonder with her litter of sucking pigs seems
very interesting Come lets have a look Arent the little pigs dear
things Id like to climb in and take one of them up to pet it do you
spose shed mind it if I did I can see decided improvement in the
modern hogs over old Mose Batchellers If you remember his were what
were known as razorbacks They could go like the wind and the fence
was not made that could stop them If they couldnt root under it they
could turn themselves sidewise and slide through between the rails
It was told me that failing all else they could give their tails a
swingyou remember the big balls of mud they used to have on their
tails endsthey could swing their tails after the manner of an athlete
throwing the hammer and fly over the top of the tallest stakeandrider
fence ever put up I dont know whether this is the strict truth or not
but it is what was told me as a little boy and I dont think people
would wilfully deceive an innocent child

The pigs nowaday arent as smart as that but they cut up better at
hogkilling time They arent quite so trim indeed they are nothing
but cylinders of meat whittled to a point at the front end and set on
four pegs but as you lean on the toprail of the pens out at the County
Fair and look down upon them you can picture in your mind without
much effort ham and sidemeat and bacon and spareribs and smoked
shoulder and headcheese and liverwurst and sausages and glistening
white lard for crullers and piecrustYes I think pigs are right
interesting I know theyve got Scripture for it the folks that think
it is wrong to eat pork but somehow I feel sorry for them they miss
such a lot not only in the eating line but other ways They are always
being persecuted and harassed and picked at Whereas the porkfed man
it seems to me sort of hankers to be picked at It gives him a good
chance to slap somebody slonchways He feels better after he has seen
his persecutors go away with a cut lip and fingering of their teeth to
see if theyre all there

Youll just have to take me gently but firmly by the sleeve and lead me
past the next exhibit the noisy one where theres so much cackling
and crowing I give you fair warning that if you get me started talking
about chickens the County Fair will have to wait till some other time
I dont know much about ducks and geese and guineahens and peafowl
and turkeys but chickensWhy say We had a hen once Plymouth Rock
she was we called her Henrietta and honestly that hen knew more than
some folks One time sheall right Ill hush Lets go in here

I dont remember whether the pies and cakes and canned fruit and such
are in Pomona Hall or the Fine Arts Hall Fine Arts Hall I think They
ought to be I speak to be one of the judges that give out the premiums
in this department Id be generous and let somebody else do the judging
of the cakes because I dont care much for cake Oh I can manage
to choke it down but I havent the expert knowledge practical and
scientific that I have in the matter of pie Id bear my share of the
work when it came to the other things jellies and preserves and pies
but not cake Wouldnt know just exactly how to go at it in the matter
of jellies Id take a glass of currant and hold it up to the light to
note its crimson glory And Id lift off the waxed paper top and peer
in and maybe give the jelly a shake And then Id take a spoon and
taste closing my eyes so as to appear to deliberatetheyd roll up
in an ecstacy anyhowand Id smack my lips and say Mmmmm very
thoughtfully and set the glass back and write down in my book my
judgment which would invariably be First Prize Because if there is
anything on top of this green earth that I think is just about right it
is currant jelly Grape jelly is nice and crabapple jelly has its good
points and quince jelly is very delicate but there is something about
currant jelly that seems to touch the spot Quince preserves are good
if there is enough apple with the quince and watermelon preserves are a
great favorite not because they are so much better tasting but because
the lucent golden cubes in the spicy syrup appeal so to the eye But
if you want to know what I think is really good eating in the preserve
line you just watch my motions when I come to the tomato preserves
these little figtomatoes and see how quick the red card is put on
them Yes indeed Its been a long time hasnt it since you had any
tomatopreserves you that havent been Back Home lately

Its no great trick to put up other fruit so that it will keep but Id
look the canned tomatoes over pretty carefully and if I saw that one
lady had not only put them up so that they hadnt turned foamy but had
also succeeded with green corn and that other poser string beans
Id give her first premium because Id know she was a firstrate
housekeeper and a careful woman and one that deserved encouragement

But Id save myself for the pies I can tell a rich short flaky crust
and I can tell the kind that is as brown as a dried apple and tough as
the same on the top and sad and livery on the bottom And I know about
fillings how thick they ought to be and how they ought to be seasoned
and all Particularly pumpkinpies because I had early advantages that
way that very few other boys had I was allowed to scrape the crock that
had held the pumpkin for the pies So thats how I know as much as I do

I suppose however when all is said and done that there is no pie that
can quite come up to an applepie You take nice short crust thats
been worked up with icewater and line the tin with it and fill it
heaping with sliced tart applesnot sauce Mercy noand sweeten
them just right and put on a lump of butter and some allspice and
perhaps a clove and a little lemon peel and then put on the cover
and trim off the edge and pinch it up in scallops and draw a couple of
leaves in the top with a sharp knife and have the oven just right and
set it in there and I tell you that when ma opens the ovendoor to see
how the pie is coming on there distils through the house such a perfume
that you cry out in a choking voice Say Aint dinner most ready

But I fully recognize the fact that very often our judgment is warped by
feeling and I am inclined to believe that even the undoubted merit of
the applepie would not prevail against a vinegarpie if such should be
presented to me for my decision A vinegarpie Well it has a top and
bottom crust the same as any other pie but its filling is made
of vinegar diluted with water to the proper degree of subacidity
sweetened with molasses thickened with flour and all baked as any
other pie You smile at its crude simplicity and wonder why I should
favor it To you it doesnt tell the story that it does to me It
doesnt take you back in imagination to the airly days when folks
came over the mountains in covered wagons and settled in the Western
Reserve leaving behind them all the civilization of their day and its
comforts parting from relatives and friends knowing full well that
in this life they never more should look upon their facesleaving
everything behind to make a new home in the western wilds

Is was a land of promise that they came to The virgin soil bore
riotously There were fruittrees in the forest that Johnny Appleseed
had planted on his journeyings The young husband could stand in his
dooryard and kill wild turkeys with his rifle They fed to loathing
on venison and squirrels and all manner of game and once in a great
while they had the luxury of salt pork They were wellnourished
but sometimes they pined for that which was more than mere food They
hungered for that which should be to the meals victuals what the flower
is to the plant

I whooshtI woosht was so we could hev pie sighed one such Let
us call him Uriah Kinney I think that sounds as if it were his name

Lands sakes snapped his wife exasperated that he should be thinking
of the same thing that she was Lands sakes Haow d ye spose I kin
make a pie when I haint got eer a thing to make it aout o You gimme
suthirnn to make it aout o an you see haow quick

I aint afaultinn ye Mary Ann interposed Uriah gently I know haow
t is I was ony tellin ye I git I git a kind o humsick sometimes
Pears like as if I shd feel more resigned like Dont ye cry Mary
Ann I know I know You feel julluk I do baout back home an all luk
that

O woman When the heft of thy intellect is thrown against a problem
something has got to give Not long after Uriah sits down to dinner
and can hardly ask a blessing he has to swallow so A pie is on the
table

Gosh Mary Ann but this is good says he holding out his hand
for the third piece This is lickinn good And he celebrates her
achievement far and wide

My Mary Ann med me a pie t other day was the allfiredest best pie I
ever et

Med you what

Med me a pie

Pie Whutch talkinn baout Cant git nummore pies naow Frot s all
gin aout

I golly she med it just the same Smartest woman y ever see The man
dribbled at the mouth

What sh make it aout o

Vinegar an worter I think she said I d know s I ever et anythinn
I relished julluk that My Mary Ann tell yew Shes baouts smart s
they make em

I wish I knew who she really was whom I have called Mary Ann Kinney she
that made the first vinegarpie I wish I knew where her grave is that
I might lay upon it a bunch of flowers such as she knew and
likedsweetwilliam and phlox and larkspur and wild columbine It
couldnt make it up to her for all the hardships she underwent when she
was bringing up a family in that wild western country and especially
that fall when they all had the fever n ager so bad Uriah and the
twins chilling one day and Hiram and Sophronia Jane the next and she
just as miserable as any of them but keeping up somehow God only knows
how It couldnt make it up to her but as I laid the pretty posies
against the leaning headstone on which is written

 A Loving Wife a Mother Dear
 Faithful Friend Lies Buried Here

I believe she d get word of it somehow and understand what I was
trying to say by it

Ill ask to be let off the committee that judges the rest of the
exhibits in the Fine Arts Hall the quilts and the Battenberg and the
crocheting and such I know the Log Cabin pattern and the
Mexican Feather pattern and I think I could make out to tell the
HenandChickens pattern of quilts but thats as much as ever And as
to the real handpainted views of fruitcake and grapes and apples on
a red tablecloth I am one of those that cant make allowances for the
fact that she only took two terms I call to mind one picture that Miss
Alvalou Ashbaker made of her pap old Coonrod Ashbaker The Lord knows
he was a humbly critter but he wasnt as humbly as she made him out
to be with his eyes bulging out of his head as if he was choking on a
fishbone And instead of her dressing him up in his Sunday clothes I
wish I may never see the back of my neck if that girl didnt paint him
in a redandblack barred flannel shirt with porcelain buttons on it
And his hair looked as if the calf had been at it Wouldnt you think
somebody would have told her And that isnt all She got the premium

Neither am I prepared to pass judgment on the fancy penmanship displayed
by Professor Swope framed elegantly in black walnut and gilt
depicting a bounding deer all made out of hairline shaded spirals
done with his facile pen No wonder a deer can jump so with all those
springs inside him Professor Swope writes visiting cards for you
wonderful birds done in flourishes and holding ribbons in their bills
He puts your name on the ribbon place Neatest and tastiest thing you
can imagine I like to watch him do it but it makes me feel unhappy
somehow I never was much of a scribe and its too late for me to learn
now

I dont feel so downcast when I examine the specimens of writing done by
the children of District No 34 I can just see the young ones working
at home on these things with their tongues stuck out of one corner of
their mouths

 Rome was not built in a day
 Rome was not built in a day
 Rome was not built in a day

and so on bearing down hard on the downstroke of the curve in the
capital R and clubbing the end of the little t And in the higher
grades they toil over An Original Social Letter describing to
an imaginary correspondent a visit to Crystal Lake or the Magnetic
Springs I can hear them mourn What shall I say next and Ma make
Effie play some place else wont you She jist joggles the table like
everything Now see what you done Now I got to write it all over
again No I caint scratch it out Howd it look to the County Fair
all scratched out Plague take it all

The same hands have done maps of North and South America and
redandblue ink pictures of the circulation of the blood It does beat
all how smart the young ones are nowadays I could no more draw off a
picture of the circulation of the bloodget it right I meanwhy I
wouldnt attempt it

I am kind of mixed up in my recollection of the hall right next to the
Fine Arts You know it had two doors in each end Sometimes I can
see the central space between the doors roped off and devoted to
sewingmachines with persons demonstrating that they ran as light as a
feather and how it was no trouble at all to tuck and gather and
fell to organs which struck me with amaze because by some witchcraft
octave coupler I think they called it the man could play on keys
that he didnt touch and pianos whereon young ladies were prevailed to
perform Silvery Wavesthats a lovely piece I think dont youand

 Listen to the mockingbird TEEdieeedleDONG
 Lisen to the mockingbird teedleeedleEEdle DONG
 The mockingbird still singing oer her grave
 toomatooraloocalLEE

And then again I can see that central ropedoff space given over
to reckless deviltry sheer impudent brazenfaced bold
disciplinedefying ererwickedness I had heard that people did
things like that but this was the first time I had ever caught a
glimpse of such carryingson in the broad open daylight right before
everybody I stood there and watched them for hours expecting every
minute to see fire fall from heaven on them and burn up every son and
daughter of Belial But it didnt

I seem to recollect that it was a hot day and that tucked away where
not a breath of air could get to them were three fellows in their
shirtsleeves one playing on an organ one on a yellow clarinet and
one on a fiddle Every chance he could get the fiddler would say to the
organist Gimme A please and saw away trying to get into some sort
of tune but the catgut was never twisted that would hold to pitch
with the perspiration dribbling down his fingers in little rills The
clarinet man looked as if he wanted to cry and he had to twitter his
eyelids all the time to keep the sweat from blinding him and every once
in a while his soggy reed would let go of a squawk that sounded like
a scared chicken But the organ groaned on unrelentingly and the tune
didnt matter so much as the rhythm which was kept up as regular as a
clock whack whack whack whack And there were two or three other
fellows with badges on that went around shouting Select your podners
for the next quadrille One more couple wanted right over here

Dancing Mhm

The fiddler called off and chanted to the tune with his mouth on one
side Sullootch podners First couple forward and back Side couples
the same Doe see doooo Alleeman LEFT Ballunce ALL Saweeny the
corners I dont know whether I get the proper order of these commands
or not or whether my memory serves me as to their effect but it seems
to me that at Ballunce ALL the ladies demurely teetered first on
one foot and then on the other like a frozentoed rooster while the
gents fairly tore themselves apart with grapevine twists and fancy
steps and slapped the dust out of the cracks in the floor When it came
to SaWEENG your podners the room billowed with flying skirts and the
ladies squealed like anything It made you a little dizzy to watch them
do Graaan right and left and you could understand how those folks
feltthere were always one or two in each setwho had to be hauled
this way and that not sure whether they were having a good time or
not but hoping they were their faces set in a sickly grin while their
foreheads wrinkled into a puzzled Hows that I didnt quite catch
that last remark expression I dont know if it affected you in the
same way that it did me but after I had stood there for a time and
watched those young men and women thus wasting the precious moments that
dropped like priceless pearls into the ocean of Eternity and were
lost irrevocably young men and women giving themselves up to present
enjoyment without one serious thought in their minds as to who was going
to wash the supper dishes or what would happen if the house took fire
while they were away I say I do not know how the sight of such reckless
frivolity affected you but I know that after so long a time my face
would get all cramped up from wearing a grin and Id have to go out and
look at the reapers and binders to rest myself so I could come back and
look some There are two things that you simply have to do at the County
Fair or you arent right sure youve been One is to drink a glass of
sweet cider just from the press which I may say in passing is an
overrated luxury Cider has to be just the least bit frisky to be
good I dont mean hard but frisky You know And the other is to
buy a whip if it is only the little toy fifteencent kind On the
next soapbox to the old fellow that comes every year to sell pictorial
Bibles and red plushcovered albums the old fellow in the green
slippers that talks as if he were just ready to drop off to sleepon
the next soapbox to him is the man that sells the whips You can buy
one for a dollar two for a dollar or four for a dollar but not one
for fifty cents or one for a quarter Dont ask me why for I dont
know I am just stating the facts It cant be done for Ive seen it
tried and if you keep up the attempt too long the whipman will lose
all patience with your unreasonableness and tell you to go long about
your business if youve got any and not bother the life and soul out of
him because he wont sell anything but a dollars worth of whips and
thats all there is about it

He sells other things handsaws and pencils and mouthharps and two
knives for a quarter of such pure steel that he whittles shavings off
a wire nail with em and is particular to hand you the very identical
knife he did it with He has jewelry though I dont suppose you could
cut a wire nail with it You might at that

To him approaches a boy

Got ny collarbuttons

Well now Ill just look and see Heres a beautiful rolledplate gold
watchchain with an elegant jewel charm Lovely blue jewel He dangles
the chain and its rich glass pendant and it certainly does look fine
Thatd cost you 250 at the store Howd that strike you

Hpm I want a collarbutton

Well now you hold on a minute Lemme look again Ah heres a package
at orta have some in it Yes sir heres four of em enough to last
you a lifetime front back and both sleeves the kind that flips and
dont tear the buttonholes Well by ginger Now howd that git in
here I want to know That gold ring Well I dont care Itll have to
go with the collarbuttons Tell you what Ill do with you Ill let you
have this elegant solid gold rolledplate watchchain and jewel this
elegant solid gold ring to git married withHay How about itand
these four collarbuttons forfortwentyfive cents or a quarter of a
dollar

That boy never took that quarter out of his breeches pocket It just
jumped out of itself But I see that you are getting the fidgets Youre
hoping that Ill come to the horseracing pretty soon You want to
have it all brought back to you the big big racetrack which as you
remember it now must have been about the next size smaller than the
earths orbit around the sun You want me to tell about the old farmer
with the bunch of timothy whiskers under his chin that gets his old
jingling wagon on the track just before a heat is to be trotted and
all the people yell at him Take him out You want me to tell how
the trotters looked walking around in their dusters with the eyeholes
bound with red braid and how the drivers of the sulkies sat with the
tails of their horses tucked under one leg Well Im not going to
do anything of the kind and if you dont like it you can go to the
boxoffice and demand your money back I hope youll get it First
place I dont know anything about racing and consequently I dont
believe its a good thing for the country All I know is that some
horses can go faster than others but which are the fastest ones I cant
tell by the looks though I have tried several times I did not walk
back I bought a roundtrip ticket They will tell you that these events
at the County Fair tend to improve the breed of horses So they doof
fast horses But the fast horses are no good They cant any of them go
as fast as a nickel trolleycar when it gets out where there arent any
houses And they not only are no good theyre a positive harm You know
and I know that just as soon as a man gets cracked after fast horses
its goodby John with him

In the next place I wouldnt mind it if it was only interesting to me
But it isnt It bores me to death You sit there and sit there trying
to keep awake while the drivers jockey and jockey scheming to get the
advantage of the other fellow and the bell rings so many times for them
to come back after you think Theyre off this time sure that you
get sick of hearing it And when they do get away why who can tell
which horse is in the lead On the far side of the track they dont
appear to do anything but poke along and once in a while some fool
horse will break and thats annoying And then when they come into
the stretch the other folks that see you with the fieldglasses keep
nudging you and asking Who s ahead mister Hay Whos ahead And
its ruinous to the voice to yell Go it Go it Go IT ye devil
you with your throat all clenched that way and your face as red as a
turkeygobblers And that second when they are going under the wire
and the horse you rather like is about a nose behind the other one
that you despiseOh tedious very tedious Ho hum Harry If I wasnt
engaged I wouldnt marry Did you think to put a saucer of milk out for
the kitty before you locked up the house

No Horseracing bores me to death and as I am one of the charter
members of the AntiOtherFolksEnjoyment Society organized to stop
people from amusing themselves in ways that we dont care for you
can readily see that it is a matter of principle with me to ignore
horseracing and not to give it so much encouragement as would come from
mentioning it

If youre so interested in improving the breed of horses by competitive
contests what s the matter with that one where the prize is 5 for the
team that can haul the heaviest load on a stoneboat straight pulling
Pile on enough stones to build a house pretty near and the owner
of the team a young fellow with a face like Keats goes Ck Ck Ck
Geet ep thah BILL Geet ep Dollay and cracks his whip and
kisses with his mouth and the horses dance and tug and jump around and
strain till the stoneboat slides on the grass and then men climb on
until the load gets so heavy that the team cant budge it Then another
team tries and so on the competitors jawing and jowering at each other
with Ah that aint fair That aint fair They started it sideways

That dont make no difference

Yes it does too make a difference Straight ahead four inches
thats the rule

Well didnt they go straight ahead four inches Whats a matter with
ye

Ill darn soon show ye whats the matter with me you come any o your
shenanigan around here

Mighty ready to accuse other folks o shenannigan aint ye For half
a cent Id paste you in the moot

Now boys Now boys None o that

Lots more excitement than a horserace Lots more improving to the mind
and beneficial to the country

And if you hanker after the human element of skill whats the matter
with the contest where the women see who can hitch up a horse the
quickest Didnt you have your favorite picked out from the start I
did She was about thirteen years old dressed in an organdie and I
think she had light blue ribbons flying from her hat light blue or
pink I forget which Her pa helped her unharness and you could tell by
the way he lookat her that he thought she was about the smartest
young one for her age in her neighborhood You ought to hear her play
General Grants Grand March on the organ he bought for her a fine
organ with twentyfour stops and two full sets of reeds and a mirror in
the top and places to set bouquets and all There was a woman in the
contest that seemed by her actions to think that the others were just
wasting their time competing with her but when they got the word Go
Old Nate Wells was the judge he sold out the liverystable business
to Charley you recollect her horse backed in wrong and she got the
harness all twistyways and everything went bewitched And wasnt she
provoked though Served her right I say A little woman beside her was
the first to jump into her buggy and drive off with a strong inhalation
of breath and that nipping together of the lips that says Aaah I
tell ye The little girl that we picked out was hopping around like a
scared cockroach and her pa seemed to be saying Now keep cool Keep
cool Dont get flustered but when another woman drove off I know she
almost cried she felt so bad But she was third and when she and her
pa drove around the ring the people clapped her lots more than the
other two I guess they must have picked her for a favorite the same as
you and I did Bless her heart I hope she got a good man when she grew
up

Around back of the Old Settlers Cabin where they have the relics the
spinningwheel the flaxhackle and the bunch of dusty tow that nobody
knows how to spin in these degenerate days the old flintlock rifle
and the powderhorn the tinderbox and the blue plate moren a
hundred years old the dogirons tongs poker and turkeywing of an
ancient fireplacearound back of the Old Settlers Cabin all the early
part of the day a bunch of dirty canvas has been dangling from a rope
stretched between two trees It was fenced off from the curious but
after dinner a stranger in fringy trousers and a black singlet went
around picking out big strong adventurous young fellows to stand about
the wooden ring fastened to the bottom of the bunch of canvas which
went over the smokepipe of a sort of underground furnace in which a
roaring fire had been built As the hot air filled the great bag it was
the task of these helpers to shake out the wrinkles and to hold it down
Older and wiser ones forbade their young ones to go near it Supposing
it should explode what then But we have always wanted to fly away
up into the air and what did we come to the Fair for if not for
excitement The balloon swells out amazingly fast and when the
guyropes are loosened and drop to the ground the elephantine bag
clumsily lunges this way and that causing shrill squeals from those who
fear to be whelmed in it The man in the singlet tosses kerosene into
the furnace from a tin cup and you can see the tall flames leap upward
from the flue into the balloon It grows tight as a drum

Watch your horses he calls out There is a pause Let go all
The mighty shape shoots up twenty feet or so and the man in the singlet
darts to the corner to cut a lone detaining rope As he runs he sheds
his fringy trousers

Goodby everybody he cries out and the sinister possibilities in
that phrase are overlooked in the wonder at seeing him lurch upward
through the air all glorious in black tights and yellow breechclout
Up and up he soars above the treetops and the wind gently wafts him
along a pendant to a dusky globe hanging in the sky He is just a speck
now swaying to and fro The globe plunges upward the pendant drops like
a shot There is a rustling sound It is the intake of the breath of
horror from ten thousand pairs of lungs Look Look The edges of the
parachute ruffle and then it blossoms out like an opening flower It
bounces on the air a little and rocking gently sinks like thistledown
behind the woods

It is all over The Fair is over Lets go home Isnt it wonderful
though what men can do Youll see theyll be flying like birds one
of these days Thats what we little boys think but we overhear old
Nate Wells say to Tom Slaymaker as we pass them Well I d know I
d know s these here bloon ascensions is worth the money they cost
the Sociation I seen so many of em they dont interest me nummore
Less o course sumpun should happen to the feller




CHRISTMAS BACK HOME


It was the time of year when the store windows are mighty interesting
Plotners bakery that away way back in the summertime was an
icecream saloon showed a plaster man in the window with long white
whiskers in top boots and a brown coat and peaked hat all trimmed with
fur and carrying a little pinetree with arsenical foliage Over his
head dangled a thicket of canes hanging by their crooks from a twine
string stretched across They were made of candy striped spirally in red
and white There were candy men and women in the window and chocolate
mice with red eyes and a big cake all over frosting with a candy
preacher on it marrying a candy man and lady The little children stood
outside with their joggerfies and arithmetics and spellers and
slates bound in red flannel under their arms and swallowed hard as they
looked Whenever anybody went in for a pennys worth of yeast and opened
the door that had a bell fastened to it so that Mrs Plotner could
hear in the back room and come to wait on the customer the smell of
wintergreen and peppermint and lemonsticks and hot taffy gushed out so
strong that they couldnt swallow fast enough but stood there choking
and dribbling at the mouth

Browns shoe store exhibited green velvet slippers with deers heads
on them and Galbraiths windows were hung with fancy dressgoods and
handkerchiefs with dogs heads in the corners but next to Plotners
Cases drugandbook store was the nicest When you first went in it
smelled of cough candy and orris root but pretty soon you could notice
the smell of drums and new sleds and about the last smell sort of
down at the bottom of things was the smell of new books the fishglue
on the binding and the muslin covers and the printers ink and that
is a smell that if it ever gets a good hold of you never lets go There
were the Rollo books and the Little Prudy books and Minnie and
Her Pets and the Elm Island series and the Arabian Nights with
colored pictures and There were skates all curled up at the toes and
balls of red and black leather in alternate quarters and China mugs
with Love the Giver and For a Good Boy in gilt letters on them
Kind of Dutch letters they were And there were dolls with black shiny
hair and red cheeks and blue eyes with perfectly arched eyebrows
They had on black shoes and white stockings with pink garters and they
almost always toed in a little They looked so cold in the window with
nothing but a shimmy on and fairly ached to be dressed and nursed
and sung to The little girls outside the window felt an emptiness in
the hollow of their left arms as they gazed There was one big doll in
the middle all dressed up It had real hair that you could comb and it
was wax Pure wax Yes sir And it could open and shut its eyes and if
you squeezed its stomach it would cry of course not like a real baby
but more like one of those ducks that stand on a sort of bellows thing
Though they all chose that doll and hoped for miracles none of them
really expected to find it in her stocking sixteen days later They
kept count of the days Maybe Bell Brown might get it her pa bought
her lots of things She had parlor skates and a parrot only her ma
wouldnt let her skate in the parlor it tore up the carpet so and the
parrot bit her finger like anything

The little boys kicked their coppertoed boots to keep warm and
quarreled about which one chose the train of cars first and then began
to quarrel over an army of soldiers

I choose them

Aaw You choosed the ingine and the cars

Dung care I choose everything in this whole window

Aaw That aint fair

In the midst of the wrangle somebody finds out that Johnny Pym has
a piece of red glass and then they begin fighting for turns looking
through it at the snow and the courthouse But not for long They
fall to bragging about what they are going to get for Christmas Eddie
Cameron was pretty sure he d get a spyglass He asked his pa and his
pa said Mebby Hed see about it Then just in time they looked up
and saw old man Nicholson coming along with his shawl pinned around him
They ran to the other side of the street because he stops little boys
and pats them on the head and asks them if they have found the Savior
It makes some boys cry when he asks them that

The Rowan twinsAlfaretta and Luanna Mayare working a pair of
slippers for their pa one apiece because it is such slow work Along
about suppertime they make Elmer Lonnie stay outside and watch for his
coming and he has to say Hello pa very loud and romp with him
outside the gate so as to give the twins time to gather up the colored
zephyrs and things and hide them in the lower bureau drawer in the
spare bedroom At such a time their mother finds an errand that takes
her into the parlor so that she can see that they do not by any chance
look into the middle drawer in the farther lefthand corner under the
pillowslips

One night just at suppertime Elmer Lonnie said Hello pa and
then they heard pa whispering and Elmer Lonnie came in looking very
solemnor trying toand said Ma Miss Waldo wants to know if you
wont please step over there a minute

Did she say what for Because Im right in the midst of getting
supper I look for your pa any minute now and I dont want to keep him
waiting

No m she didnt say what for She jist said Ast yer ma wont she
please an step over here a minute I wouldnt put anythin on T
aint cold You neednt stay long only till I guess shes in some of
a hurry

Well if Harriet Waldo thinks at I havent anythin better to do n
trot around after her at her beck an All right Ill come

The twins got their slippers hid and Mrs Rowan threw her shawl over
her head and went next door to take Mrs Waldo completely by surprise
The good woman immediately invented an intricate problem in crochet
work demanding instant solution Mr Rowan had brought home a crayon
enlargement of a daguerreotype of Ma taken before she was married when
they wore their hair combed down over their ears and wide lace collars
fastened with a big cameo pin and puffed sleeves with the armholes
nearly at the elbows They wore lace mitts then too The twins thought
it looked so funny but Pa said It was all the style in them days
Laws I mind the first time I took her home from singin school
Tell you where less hide it In between the straw tick and the feather
tick And Luanna May said What if company should come Elmer Lonnie
ran over to Mrs Waldos to tell Ma that Pa had come home and wanted
his supper right quick because he had to get back to the store there
was so much trade in the evenings now

I declare Emmeline Rowan youre gettin to be a reglar gadabout
said Mr Rowan very savagely Gad gad gad from mornin till night
Aint they time in daylight fer you an Hat Waldo to talk about your
neighbors at you cant stay home long enough to git me my supper

He winked at the twins so funny that Alfaretta who always was kind of
flighty made a little noise with her soft palate and tried to pass it
off for a cough Luanna May poked her in the ribs with her elbow and
Mrs Rowan spoke up quite loud Why Pa how you go on I wasnt but
a minute an you hardly ever come before halfpast And furthermore
mister I want to know how Im to keep this house alookin like
anything an you atrackin in snow like that Just look at you I shd
think youd know enough to stomp your feet before you come in
Luanna May you come grind the coffee Alfie run git your Pa his old
slippers That set both of them to giggling and Mrs Rowan went out
into the kitchen and began to pound the beefsteak

D you think she sispicioned anythin asked Mr Rowan out of one side
of his mouth and Elmer Lonnie said No sir and wondered if his Pa
sispicioned anythin when Ma said Run git the old slippers

Mr Waldo always walked up with Mr Rowan and just about that time his
little Mary Ellen was climbing up into his lap and saying I bet you
cant guess what Im agoin to buy you for a Christmas gift with my
pennies what I got saved up

Ill just bet I can

No you cant Its awful prettyI mean theyre awful pretty Somepin
you want too How could he guess with her fingering his tarnished cuff
buttons and looking down at them every minute or two

Well now let me see Is it a gold watch

Nope

Aw now I jist set my heart on a gold watch and chain

Well but itd cost more money n I got Three or fifteen dollars
mebby

Well let me see Is it a shotgun

No sir Oh you just cant guess it

Aw now youre foolin No it aint a horse and buggy

I know what it is Its a dolly with real hair that you can comb and
all dressed up in a blue dress One that can shut its eyes when it goes
byebye

Little Mary Ellen looks at him very seriously a minute and sighs and
says No it aint that But if it was wouldnt you let me play with
it when you was to the store And he catches her up in his arms and
says You betchy Now I aint goin to guess any more I want to be
surprised You jump down an run an ask Ma if supper aint most ready
Tell her Im as hungry as a hound pup

He hears her deliver the message and also the word her mother sends
back Tell him to hold his horses It ll be ready in a minute

It will eh Well I cant wait a minute an Im goin to take a
hogbite right out of YOU and he snarls and bites her right in the
middle of her stomach and if there is anything more ticklesome than
that it hasnt been heard of yet

After supper little Eddie Allgire teases his brother D to tell him
about Santa Claus D is cracking walnuts on a flatiron held between
his knees

Is they any Santy Claus D

Eddie nodded his head Anyhow what D told him was the Lord said unto
Moses and now that he had the evidence of his own eyesWell the next
day he defied Bunt Rogers and all his works To tell the plain truth
Bunt wasnt too well grounded in his newly cut infidelity


In the public schools the children were no longer singing

 None knew thee but to love thee thou dear one of my heart
 Oh thy memry is ever fresh and green
 The sweet buds may wither and fond hearts be broken
 Still I love thee my darling Daisy Deane

They turned over now to page 53 and there was a picture of Santa Claus
just as in Plotners window except that he had a pack on his back and
one leg in the chimney This is what they sang

 Ho ho ho Who wouldnt go
 Ho ho ho Who wouldnt go
 Up on the housetop click click click
 Down through the chimney with good St Nick

Miss Munsell who taught the D primary traded rooms with Miss Crutcher
who taught the ab Abs Miss Munsell was a big fat lady and she
smiled so that the dimples came in both cheeks and her double Chin was
doubter than ever when she told the children what a dear nice teacher
Miss Crutcher was and how fond she was of them and wouldnt they like
to make a Christmas present to their dear kind teacher They all said
Yes mam Well now the way to do would be for each child to bring
money if Miss Munsell had smiled at a bird in the tree as she did then
it would have had to come right down and perch in her hand just as
much money as ever they could and all must bring something because it
would make Miss Crutcher feel so bad to think that there was one
little boy or one little girl that didnt love her enough to give her a
Christmas present And if everybody brought a dime or maybe a quarter
they could get her such a nice present If their papas wouldnt let
them have that much money why surely they would let them have a penny
wouldnt they children And the children said Yes mam

And now all that love their dear kind teacher raise their hands Why
theres a little girl over that hasnt her hand up Thats right dear
put it up bless your little heart Now we mustnt say a word to Miss
Crutcher must we No And that will be our secret wont it And all be
sure to have your money ready by tomorrow Now I wonder if you can be
just as still as little mice Im going to give this little girl a pin
to drop and see if I can hear it out in the hall

Then she tiptoed down the hall clear to her own room and Mary Ellen
Waldo let the pin drop and Miss Mussell didnt come back to say whether
she heard the pin drop or not The children sat in breathless
silence Selma Morgenroth knocked her slate off and bit her lip with
mortification while the others looked at her as much as to say Oh
my aint you shamed Then Miss Crutchet came back and smiled at the
children and they smiled back at her because they knew something she
didnt know and couldnt guess at all It was a secret

The next morning Miss Crutchet traded rooms again and the little
children gave Miss Mussell their money and she counted it and it came
to 284 The next day she came again because there were three that
hadnt their money so there was 288 at last Miss Mussell had three
little girls go with her after school to pick out the present They
chose a silverplated pickle caster which is exactly what girls of
seven will choose and do you know it came exactly to 288

Then on the last day of school Miss Mussell came in and with the
three little girls standing on the platform and following every move
with their eyes as a dog watches his master she gave the caster to Miss
Crutchet and Miss Crutchet cried she was so surprised They were tears
of joy she said After that she went into Miss Munsells room and
three little girls in there gave Miss Mussell a copy of Tennysons poems
that cost exactly 253 which was what Miss Crutchet had collected and
Miss Mussell cried because she was so surprised How they could guess
that she wanted a copy of Tennysons poems she couldnt think but
she would always keep the book and prize it because her dear pupils had
given it to her And just as Selma Morgenroth called out to the monitor
Charley Freer who sat in Miss Crutchers chair while she was absent
Teacher Make Miky Ryan he should kavit apullin at my hair yet and
the school was laughing because she called Charley Freer teacher in
came Miss Crutchet as cross as anything and boxed Miky Ryans ears
and shook Selma Morgenroth for making so much noise They didnt give
anything though they promised they would

It was not alone in the day schools that there were extra preparations
The Sundayschools were getting ready too and when Janey Pettit came
home and told her Pa how big her class was he started to say something
but her Ma shook her head at him and he looked very serious and seemed
to be trying hard not to smile He was very much interested though
when she told him that Iky Morgenroth whose father kept the OnePrice
Clothing House down on Main Street had joined and how he didnt know
enough to take his hat off when he came into church Patsy Gubbins and
Miky Ryan and six boys from the Baptist SundaySchool had joined too
and they all went into Miss Sarepta Downeys class so that she had two
whole pews full to teach and they acted just awful The infant
class was crowded and there was one little boy that grabbed for the
collection when it was passed in front of him and got a whole handful
and wouldnt give it up and they had to twist the money out of his
fist and he screamed and hollered like he was being killed And
coming home Sophy Perkins who goes to the Baptist Church told
her that there wasnt going to be any Christmas tree at their
Sabbathschool She said that there wasnt hardly anybody out The
teachers just sat round and finally went into the pastors Bible class
Mr Pettit said he was surprised to hear it It couldnt have been the
weather that kept them away could it Janey said she didnt know Then
he asked her what they were going to sing for Christmas and she
began on We three kings of Orient are and broke off to ask him what
Orient meant and he told her that Orient was out on the Sunbury pike
about three miles this side of Olive Green and her Ma said Lester
Pettit I wisht youd ever grow up and learn how to behave yourself
Why honey it means the East The three wise men came from the East
dont you mind

At the Centre Street M E Church where Janey Pettit went to
Sundayschool there were big doings Little Lycurgus Emerson whose
mother sent him down to Littells in a hurry for two pounds of brown
sugar and who had already been an hour and a half getting past
Plotners and Cases heard Brother Littell and Abel Horn talking over
what they had decided at the fishery meetin By the time Curg got
so that he shaved he knew that officiary was the right way to say
it just as certificate is the right way to say stiffcut There was
going to be a Christmas tree clear up to the ceiling all stuck full of
candles and strung with popcorn and a chimney for Santa Claus to climb
down and give out the presents and call out the names on them Every
child in the Sundayschool was to get a bag of candy and an orange and
there were going to be exercises Curg thought it would be kind of
funny to go through gymnastics but just then he saw Uncle Billy
Nicholson come in and he hid He didnt want to be patted on the head
andasked things

Uncle Billy had his mouth all puckered up and his eyebrows looked more
like toothbrushes than ever He put down the list of groceries that
Aunt Libby had written out for him because he couldnt remember things
very well and commenced to lay down the law

Such carryins on in the house o God he snorted Why the very idy
Talk about them Pharisees an Sadducees amakin the temple a den o
thieves Wy youre aturnin it into a theayter with your playactin
tomfoolery Theyll be no blessin on it now you mark

Aunt Libby say whether she wanted stoned raisins asked Brother
Littell who was copying off the list on the order book

I disremember but you better send up the reglar raisins Gittin too
many newfangled contraptions these days Theyre acallin it a theayter
right now the Babtists is What you astin fer your eatin apples
Whew My souls alive I dont wonder you grocery storekeepers git rich
in a hurry No I guess you neednt send ny up Taste too strong o
money Dont have no good apples now no more anyways All so dried up
and pethy An what is it but a theayter Id like to know Weth your
lectures about the Artic regions an your mumsocials an all like
that chargin money fer to git in the meetin house I tell you what it
is Brother Littell the women folks d take the money they fritter away
on ribbons and artificial flowers an gold ancostly apparel which I
have saw them turned away from the lovefeast fer wearin an ud give
it in fer quarterage an hep support the preachin of the Word they
wouldnt need to be no shows in the meetin house an they d be more
expeerimental religion

Abel Horn Abel led the singing in meeting and had a loud bass voice
he always began before everybody and ended after everybody was standing
behind Uncle Billy and Lycurgus could see him with his head juked
forward and his eyebrows up and his mouth wide open in silent laughter
very disconcerting to Brother Littell who didnt want to anger Uncle
Billy and maybe lose his trade by grinning in his face

An now you got to go an put up a Christmas tree right in the altar
stormed Uncle Billy an dike it all out with popcorn an candles
Youre gittin as bad s the Catholics every bit Worse I say becuz
they never had the Gospel light an is jist led round by the priest an
have to pay to git their sins forgive But you youre awalkin
right smack dab into it weth your eyes open teachin fer Gospel the
inventions o men

Wy what Uncle Billy

devised fables Think theyll come any blessin on tellin a lie An
aactin it out No sir No sir Aint ary good thing to a lie no way
you kin fix it How kin they be Whos the father of lies Wy the Old
Scratch Thats who An here you go a

The old man was so wroth that he couldnt finish and turned and stamped
out slamming the door after him

Brother Littell winked and waited till Mr Nicholson got out before he
mildly observed Kind o hot in under the collar pears like

Righteous mad I spose said Abel Horn

You waited on yit bub asked Brother Littell I betchy hes
athinkin right now hell take his letter out o Centre Street an go
to the Barefoot Church He would too if t wasnt clean plumb at the
fur end o town an a reglar mudhole to git there

Pity him an a few more of em up in the Amen corner wouldnt go said
Abel Horn Mind the time we sung There is a Stream You know
theys a solo in it fer the soprano Well t is kind o operatic an
skallyhootin up an down the scale I give the solo to Tilly Wilkerson
an if that old skeezicks didnt beller right out in the middle of it
Its a disgrace tud Divine service He did You could a heard him
clear to the courthouse My I thought Id go up Tilly she was kind
o scared an trimbly but she stuck to it like a major Said afterwards
shed a finished that solo if it was the last act she ever done

Whos agoin to be Santy Claus asked Brother Littell with cheerful
irrevelance

The committee thought that had better be kept a secret replied Abel
with as much dignity as his four feet nine would admit of

Ort to be somebody kind o heavyset ort nt it hinted the grocer
giving a recognizable description of himself

Well I don know bout that contested Abel Git somebody kind o
spry an he could pad out weth a pilfer A pussy man d find it rather
onhandy comin down that chimbly an hoppin hether an yan takin
things off o the tree Need somebody with a good strong voice too
to call off the names Wooshs youd git them things up to the house
soon s you kin Otho Mas in a hurry fer em

Betchy two cents said Brother Littell to his clerk Clarence
Bowersox at Abel Horn ll be Santy Claus

Git out doubted Clarence

Ll you see now Hes the daggonedest feller to crowd himself in an
be the head leader o everything Wy he aint no more call to be Santy
Claus n that hitchin post out yan Little driedup runt bald s a
apple Told me one time I never growd a inch tell I was sixteen
n then I shot up like a weed Bub you tell yer Ma if she wants a
turkey fer Christmas she better be gittin her order in right quick

Only six more days till Christmas nowonly fiveonly fouronly
threeonly twoChristmas Eve One day more of holding in such swelling
secrets and some of the young folks would have popped right wide open
Families gather about the Franklin stove Pa and Ma gaping and rubbing
their eyessaying Oh hum and making out that they are just plumb
perishing for the lack of sleep But the children cannot take the hint
They dont want to go to bed The imminence of a great event nerves them
in their hopeless fight against the hosts of Nod They sit and stare
with bulging eyes at the red coals and dancing flames spurting out here
and there like tiny sabers

The mystic hour draws near Sometime in the night will come the jingle
of silver bells and the patter of tiny hoofs Old Santa will halloo
Whoa and come sliding down the chimney The drowsing heads fuddled
with weariness wrestle clumsily with the problem How is he to get
through the stove without burning himself Reason falters and Faith
triumphs It would be done somehow and then the reindeer would fly
to the next house and the next and so on and so on The mystic hour
draws near Like a tidal wave it rolls around the world foaming at its
crest in a golden spray of gifts and love The mystic hour

Oh just a little longer just a little longer

No no You caint hardly prop your eyes open now Come now Get to
bed Now Elmer Lonnie now Mary Ellen now Janey now Eddie now
Lycurgus Dont be naughty at the last minute and say I dont want
to or else Santa Claus wont come anear No sir

After the last drink of water and the last Now I lay me a long
pause Then from the spare bedroom the loud rustling of stiff paper
the snap of broken string and whispers of Wont her eyes stick out
when she sees that and Hes been just fretting for a sled Im so
glad it was so t we could get it for him and I spose we ort nt to
spent so much but seems like with such nice young ones s weve got t
aint no more n right we should do for em all we can afford n
mebby a little more Janey s stiffcut said she was 100 in everything
deportment an all

At one house something white slips down the staircase to where a good
view can be had through the halfopen parlor door It pauses when a step
cracks loudly in the stillness The parlor door is slammed to

D you think he saw

I dont know Im afraid so Little tyke

Something white creeps back and crawls into bed A heart thumps
violently under the covers and two big round eyes stare up at the dark
ceiling Somebody has eaten of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge and
the gates of Eden have shut behind him forever

He does not sense that now he is glad in the exulting consciousness
that he is a little kid no longer Pretty soon hell be a man and
then and then Oh what grand things are to happen then

The mutual gifts are brought out with many a shamefaced It looks awful
little but t was the best I could do for the money You see I spent
more on the children than I lotted to and many a cheerful fib of
Why thats exactly what Ive been wishing for Some poor fools that
have never learned and never will learn that the truest word ever spoken
is It is more blessed to give than to receive make their husbands a
present of a parlor lamp or a pair of lace curtains and their wives
a present of a sack of flour or enough muslin to make half a dozen
shirts And there are deeper depths There are such words as What
possessed you to buy me that old thing Well I wont have it Now The
stovedoor is slammed open and the gift crammed in upon the coals and
two people sit there with lips puffed out chests heaving and hearts
burning with hate

It is the truth but cover it up Cover it up Turn away the head On
this Holy Night of Illusion let us forget the truth for once There
are three hundred and sixtyfour other nights in which to consider the
eternal verities On this one let us be as little children Let us now
go even to Bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass

The mystic hour draws nigh The lights go out one by one The watchman
at the flax mills rings the bell and they that are waking count the
strokes that tremble in the frosty air Eleven oclock Father and
mother sit silent by the fire The tree in the corner of the room
flashes its tinselry in the dying light A cinder tinkles on the hearth
Their thoughts are one He would be nine years old if he had lived
murmurs the mother Their hands grope for each other meet and clasp
Something aches in their throats The red coals swell and blur into a
formless mass

The mystic hour is come The town sleeps The moon rides high in the
clear heavens The wind sighs in the fir trees Faint and faroff across
the centuries sounds the chant of angels

The hour is come
