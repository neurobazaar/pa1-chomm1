 NOTE ON THE RESEMBLANCES AND DIFFERENCES IN THE STRUCTURE
 AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAIN IN MAN AND APES


BY

PROFESSOR T H HUXLEY FRS


This essay is taken from The Descent of Man and Selection in relation
to Sex by Charles Darwin where it appears at the end of Chapter VII
which is also the end of Part I Footnotes are numbered as they appear
in The Descent of Man



The controversy respecting the nature and the extent of the differences
in the structure of the brain in man and the apes which arose some
fifteen years ago has not yet come to an end though the subject
matter of the dispute is at present totally different from what it
was formerly It was originally asserted and reasserted with
singular pertinacity that the brain of all the apes even the highest
differs from that of man in the absence of such conspicuous structures
as the posterior lobes of the cerebral hemispheres with the posterior
cornu of the lateral ventricle and the hippocampus minor contained in
those lobes which are so obvious in man

But the truth that the three structures in question are as well
developed in apes as in human brains or even better and that it is
characteristic of all the Primates if we exclude the Lemurs to have
these parts well developed stands at present on as secure a basis as
any proposition in comparative anatomy Moreover it is admitted by
every one of the long series of anatomists who of late years have
paid special attention to the arrangement of the complicated sulci and
gyri which appear upon the surface of the cerebral hemispheres in man
and the higher apes that they are disposed after the very same pattern
in him as in them Every principal gyrus and sulcus of a chimpanzees
brain is clearly represented in that of a man so that the terminology
which applies to the one answers for the other On this point there is
no difference of opinion Some years since Professor Bischoff
published a memoir 70 Die GrosshirnWindungen des Menschen
Abhandlungen der K Bayerischen Akademie B x 1868 on the
cerebral convolutions of man and apes and as the purpose of my learned
colleague was certainly not to diminish the value of the differences
between apes and men in this respect I am glad to make a citation from
him

That the apes and especially the orang chimpanzee and gorilla come
very close to man in their organisation much nearer than to any other
animal is a well known fact disputed by nobody Looking at the matter
from the point of view of organisation alone no one probably would
ever have disputed the view of Linnaeus that man should be placed
merely as a peculiar species at the head of the mammalia and of those
apes Both shew in all their organs so close an affinity that the
most exact anatomical investigation is needed in order to demonstrate
those differences which really exist So it is with the brains The
brains of man the orang the chimpanzee the gorilla in spite of all
the important differences which they present come very close to one
another loc cit p 101

There remains then no dispute as to the resemblance in fundamental
characters between the apes brain and mans nor any as to the
wonderfully close similarity between the chimpanzee orang and man in
even the details of the arrangement of the gyri and sulci of the
cerebral hemispheres Nor turning to the differences between the
brains of the highest apes and that of man is there any serious
question as to the nature and extent of these differences It is
admitted that the mans cerebral hemispheres are absolutely and
relatively larger than those of the orang and chimpanzee that his
frontal lobes are less excavated by the upward protrusion of the roof
of the orbits that his gyri and sulci are as a rule less
symmetrically disposed and present a greater number of secondary
plications And it is admitted that as a rule in man the
temporooccipital or external perpendicular fissure which is usually
so strongly marked a feature of the apes brain is but faintly marked
But it is also clear that none of these differences constitutes a
sharp demarcation between the mans and the apes brain In respect to
the external perpendicular fissure of Gratiolet in the human brain for
instance Professor Turner remarks 71 Convolutions of the Human
Cerebrum Topographically Considered 1866 p 12

In some brains it appears simply as an indentation of the margin of
the hemisphere but in others it extends for some distance more or
less transversely outwards I saw it in the right hemisphere of a
female brain pass more than two inches outwards and on another
specimen also the right hemisphere it proceeded for fourtenths of an
inch outwards and then extended downwards as far as the lower margin
of the outer surface of the hemisphere The imperfect definition of
this fissure in the majority of human brains as compared with its
remarkable distinctness in the brain of most Quadrumana is owing to
the presence in the former of certain superficial well marked
secondary convolutions which bridge it over and connect the parietal
with the occipital lobe The closer the first of these bridging gyri
lies to the longitudinal fissure the shorter is the external
parietooccipital fissure loc cit p 12

The obliteration of the external perpendicular fissure of Gratiolet
therefore is not a constant character of the human brain On the
other hand its full development is not a constant character of the
higher apes brain For in the chimpanzee the more or less extensive
obliteration of the external perpendicular sulcus by bridging
convolutions on one side or the other has been noted over and over
again by Prof Rolleston Mr Marshall M Broca and Professor Turner
At the conclusion of a special paper on this subject the latter writes
72 Notes more especially on the bridging convolutions in the Brain
of the Chimpanzee Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh
18656

The three specimens of the brain of a chimpanzee just described
prove that the generalisation which Gratiolet has attempted to draw of
the complete absence of the first connecting convolution and the
concealment of the second as essentially characteristic features in
the brain of this animal is by no means universally applicable In
only one specimen did the brain in these particulars follow the law
which Gratiolet has expressed As regards the presence of the superior
bridging convolution I am inclined to think that it has existed in one
hemisphere at least in a majority of the brains of this animal which
have up to this time been figured or described The superficial
position of the second bridging convolution is evidently less frequent
and has as yet I believe only been seen in the brain A recorded in
this communication The asymmetrical arrangement in the convolutions
of the two hemispheres which previous observers have referred to in
their descriptions is also well illustrated in these specimens pp
8 9

Even were the presence of the temporooccipital or external
perpendicular sulcus a mark of distinction between the higher apes
and man the value of such a distinctive character would be rendered
very doubtful by the structure of the brain in the Platyrrhine apes
In fact while the temporooccipital is one of the most constant of
sulci in the Catarrhine or Old World apes it is never very strongly
developed in the New World apes it is absent in the smaller
Platyrrhini rudimentary in Pithecia 73 Flower On the Anatomy of
Pithecia Monachus Proceedings of the Zoological Society 1862
and more or less obliterated by bridging convolutions in Ateles

A character which is thus variable within the limits of a single group
can have no great taxonomic value

It is further established that the degree of asymmetry of the
convolution of the two sides in the human brain is subject to much
individual variation and that in those individuals of the Bushman
race who have been examined the gyri and sulci of the two hemispheres
are considerably less complicated and more symmetrical than in the
European brain while in some individuals of the chimpanzee their
complexity and asymmetry become notable This is particularly the case
in the brain of a young male chimpanzee figured by M Broca Lordre
des Primates p 165 fig 11

Again as respects the question of absolute size it is established
that the difference between the largest and the smallest healthy human
brain is greater than the difference between the smallest healthy human
brain and the largest chimpanzees or orangs brain

Moreover there is one circumstance in which the orangs and
chimpanzees brains resemble mans but in which they differ from the
lower apes and that is the presence of two corpora candicantiathe
Cynomorpha having but one

In view of these facts I do not hesitate in this year 1874 to repeat
and insist upon the proposition which I enunciated in 1863 74
Mans Place in Nature p 102

So far as cerebral structure goes therefore it is clear that man
differs less from the chimpanzee or the orang than these do even from
the monkeys and that the difference between the brain of the
chimpanzee and of man is almost insignificant when compared with that
between the chimpanzee brain and that of a Lemur

In the paper to which I have referred Professor Bischoff does not deny
the second part of this statement but he first makes the irrelevant
remark that it is not wonderful if the brains of an orang and a Lemur
are very different and secondly goes on to assert that If we
successively compare the brain of a man with that of an orang the
brain of this with that of a chimpanzee of this with that of a
gorilla and so on of a Hylobates Semnopithecus Cynocephalus
Cercopithecus Macacus Cebus Callithrix Lemur Stenops Hapale we
shall not meet with a greater or even as great a break in the degree
of development of the convolutions as we find between the brain of a
man and that of an orang or chimpanzee

To which I reply firstly that whether this assertion be true or
false it has nothing whatever to do with the proposition enunciated in
Mans Place in Nature which refers not to the development of the
convolutions alone but to the structure of the whole brain If
Professor Bischoff had taken the trouble to refer to p 96 of the work
he criticises in fact he would have found the following passage
And it is a remarkable circumstance that though so far as our present
knowledge extends there IS one true structural break in the series of
forms of Simian brains this hiatus does not lie between man and the
manlike apes but between the lower and the lowest Simians or in other
words between the Old and New World apes and monkeys and the Lemurs
Every Lemur which has yet been examined in fact has its cerebellum
partially visible from above and its posterior lobe with the
contained posterior cornu and hippocampus minor more or less
rudimentary Every marmoset American monkey Old World monkey baboon
or manlike ape on the contrary has its cerebellum entirely hidden
posteriorly by the cerebral lobes and possesses a large posterior
cornu with a welldeveloped hippocampus minor

This statement was a strictly accurate account of what was known when
it was made and it does not appear to me to be more than apparently
weakened by the subsequent discovery of the relatively small
development of the posterior lobes in the Siamang and in the Howling
monkey Notwithstanding the exceptional brevity of the posterior lobes
in these two species no one will pretend that their brains in the
slightest degree approach those of the Lemurs And if instead of
putting Hapale out of its natural place as Professor Bischoff most
unaccountably does we write the series of animals he has chosen to
mention as follows Homo Pithecus Troglodytes Hylobates
Semnopithecus Cynocephalus Cercopithecus Macacus Cebus Callithrix
Hapale Lemur Stenops I venture to reaffirm that the great break in
this series lies between Hapale and Lemur and that this break is
considerably greater than that between any other two terms of that
series Professor Bischoff ignores the fact that long before he wrote
Gratiolet had suggested the separation of the Lemurs from the other
Primates on the very ground of the difference in their cerebral
characters and that Professor Flower had made the following
observations in the course of his description of the brain of the Javan
Loris 75 Transactions of the Zoological Society vol v 1862

And it is especially remarkable that in the development of the
posterior lobes there is no approximation to the Lemurine short
hemisphered brain in those monkeys which are commonly supposed to
approach this family in other respects viz the lower members of the
Platyrrhine group

So far as the structure of the adult brain is concerned then the very
considerable additions to our knowledge which have been made by the
researches of so many investigators during the past ten years fully
justify the statement which I made in 1863 But it has been said
that admitting the similarity between the adult brains of man and
apes they are nevertheless in reality widely different because they
exhibit fundamental differences in the mode of their development No
one would be more ready than I to admit the force of this argument if
such fundamental differences of development really exist But I deny
that they do exist On the contrary there is a fundamental agreement
in the development of the brain in men and apes

Gratiolet originated the statement that there is a fundamental
difference in the development of the brains of apes and that of
manconsisting in this that in the apes the sulci which first make
their appearance are situated on the posterior region of the cerebral
hemispheres while in the human foetus the sulci first become visible
on the frontal lobes 76 Chez tous les singes les plis posterieurs
se developpent les premiers les plis anterieurs se developpent plus
tard aussi la vertebre occipitale et la parietale sontelles
relativement tresgrandes chez le foetus LHomme presente une
exception remarquable quant a lepoque de lapparition des plis
frontaux qui sont les premiers indiques mais le developpement general
du lobe frontal envisage seulement par rapport a son volume suit les
memes lois que dans les singes Gratiolet Memoire sur les plis
cerebres de lHomme et des Primateaux p 39 Tab iv fig 3

This general statement is based upon two observations the one of a
Gibbon almost ready to be born in which the posterior gyri were well
developed while those of the frontal lobes were hardly indicated
77 Gratiolets words are loc cit p 39 Dans le foetus dont il
sagit les plis cerebraux posterieurs sont bien developpes tandis que
les plis du lobe frontal sont a peine indiques The figure however
Pl iv fig 3 shews the fissure of Rolando and one of the frontal
sulci plainly enough Nevertheless M Alix in his Notice sur les
travaux anthropologiques de Gratiolet Mem de la Societe
dAnthropologie de Paris 1868 page 32 writes thus Gratiolet a eu
entre les mains le cerveau dun foetus de Gibbon singe eminemment
superieur et tellement rapproche de lorang que des naturalistes
trescompetents lont range parmi les anthropoides M Huxley par
exemple nhesite pas sur ce point Eh bien cest sur le cerveau dun
foetus de Gibbon que Gratiolet a vu LES CIRCONVOLUTIONS DU LOBE
TEMPOROSPHENOIDAL DEJA DEVELOPPEES LORSQUIL NEXISTENT PAS ENCORE DE
PLIS SUR LE LOBE FRONTAL Il etait donc bien autorise a dire que chez
lhomme les circonvolutions apparaissent da en w tandis que chez les
singes elles se developpent dw en a and the other of a human
foetus at the 22nd or 23rd week of uterogestation in which Gratiolet
notes that the insula was uncovered but that nevertheless des
incisures sement de lobe anterieur une scissure peu profonde indique
la separation du lobe occipital tresreduit dailleurs des cette
epoque Le reste de la surface cerebrale est encore absolument lisse

Three views of this brain are given in Plate II figs 1 2 3 of the
work cited shewing the upper lateral and inferior views of the
hemispheres but not the inner view It is worthy of note that the
figure by no means bears out Gratiolets description inasmuch as the
fissure anterotemporal on the posterior half of the face of the
hemisphere is more marked than any of those vaguely indicated in the
anterior half If the figure is correct it in no way justifies
Gratiolets conclusion Il y a donc entre ces cerveaux those of a
Callithrix and of a Gibbon et celui du foetus humain une difference
fondamental Chez celuici longtemps avant que les plis temporaux
apparaissent les plis frontaux ESSAYENT dexister

Since Gratiolets time however the development of the gyri and sulci
of the brain has been made the subject of renewed investigation by
Schmidt Bischoff Pansch 78 Ueber die typische Anordnung der
Furchen und Windungen auf den GrosshirnHemispharen des Menschen und
der Affen Archiv fur Anthropologie iii 1868 and more
particularly by Ecker 79 Zur Entwicklungs Geschichte der Furchen und
Windungen der GrosshirnHemispharen im Foetus des Menschen Archiv
fur Anthropologie iii 1868 whose work is not only the latest but
by far the most complete memoir on the subject

The final results of their inquiries may be summed up as follows

1 In the human foetus the sylvian fissure is formed in the course of
the third month of uterogestation In this and in the fourth month
the cerebral hemispheres are smooth and rounded with the exception of
the sylvian depression and they project backwards far beyond the
cerebellum

2 The sulci properly so called begin to appear in the interval
between the end of the fourth and the beginning of the sixth month of
foetal life but Ecker is careful to point out that not only the time
but the order of their appearance is subject to considerable
individual variation In no case however are either the frontal or
the temporal sulci the earliest

The first which appears in fact lies on the inner face of the
hemisphere whence doubtless Gratiolet who does not seem to have
examined that face in his foetus overlooked it and is either the
internal perpendicular occipitoparietal or the calcarine sulcus
these two being close together and eventually running into one another
As a rule the occipitoparietal is the earlier of the two

3 At the latter part of this period another sulcus the
posterioparietal or Fissure of Rolando is developed and it is
followed in the course of the sixth month by the other principal
sulci of the frontal parietal temporal and occipital lobes There
is however no clear evidence that one of these constantly appears
before the other and it is remarkable that in the brain at the period
described and figured by Ecker loc cit pp 212213 Taf II figs
1 2 3 4 the anterotemporal sulcus scissure parallele so
characteristic of the apes brain is as well if not better developed
than the fissure of Rolando and is much more marked than the proper
frontal sulci

Taking the facts as they now stand it appears to me that the order of
the appearance of the sulci and gyri in the foetal human brain is in
perfect harmony with the general doctrine of evolution and with the
view that man has been evolved from some apelike form though there
can be no doubt that form was in many respects different from any
member of the Primates now living

Von Baer taught us half a century ago that in the course of their
development allied animals put on at first the characters of the
greater groups to which they belong and by degrees assume those
which restrict them within the limits of their family genus and
species and he proved at the same time that no developmental stage
of a higher animal is precisely similar to the adult condition of any
lower animal It is quite correct to say that a frog passes through
the condition of a fish inasmuch as at one period of its life the
tadpole has all the characters of a fish and if it went no further
would have to be grouped among fishes But it is equally true that a
tadpole is very different from any known fish

In like manner the brain of a human foetus at the fifth month may
correctly be said to be not only the brain of an ape but that of an
Arctopithecine or marmosetlike ape for its hemispheres with their
great posterior lobster and with no sulci but the sylvian and the
calcarine present the characteristics found only in the group of the
Arctopithecine Primates But it is equally true as Gratiolet remarks
that in its widely open sylvian fissure it differs from the brain of
any actual marmoset No doubt it would be much more similar to the
brain of an advanced foetus of a marmoset But we know nothing
whatever of the development of the brain in the marmosets In the
Platyrrhini proper the only observation with which I am acquainted is
due to Pansch who found in the brain of a foetal Cebus Apella in
addition to the sylvian fissure and the deep calcarine fissure only a
very shallow anterotemporal fissure scissure parallele of Gratiolet

Now this fact taken together with the circumstance that the
anterotemporal sulcus is present in such Platyrrhini as the Saimiri
which present mere traces of sulci on the anterior half of the exterior
of the cerebral hemispheres or none at all undoubtedly so far as it
goes affords fair evidence in favour of Gratiolets hypothesis that
the posterior sulci appear before the anterior in the brains of the
Platyrrhini But it by no means follows that the rule which may hold
good for the Platyrrhini extends to the Catarrhini We have no
information whatever respecting the development of the brain in the
Cynomorpha and as regards the Anthropomorpha nothing but the account
of the brain of the Gibbon near birth already referred to At the
present moment there is not a shadow of evidence to shew that the sulci
of a chimpanzees or orangs brain do not appear in the same order as
a mans

Gratiolet opens his preface with the aphorism Il est dangereux dans
les sciences de conclure trop vite I fear he must have forgotten
this sound maxim by the time he had reached the discussion of the
differences between men and apes in the body of his work No doubt
the excellent author of one of the most remarkable contributions to the
just understanding of the mammalian brain which has ever been made
would have been the first to admit the insufficiency of his data had he
lived to profit by the advance of inquiry The misfortune is that his
conclusions have been employed by persons incompetent to appreciate
their foundation as arguments in favour of obscurantism 80 For
example M lAbbe Lecomte in his terrible pamphlet Le Darwinisme et
lorigine de lHomme 1873

But it is important to remark that whether Gratiolet was right or
wrong in his hypothesis respecting the relative order of appearance of
the temporal and frontal sulci the fact remains that before either
temporal or frontal sulci appear the foetal brain of man presents
characters which are found only in the lowest group of the Primates
leaving out the Lemurs and that this is exactly what we should
expect to be the case if man has resulted from the gradual
modification of the same form as that from which the other Primates
have sprung

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff
