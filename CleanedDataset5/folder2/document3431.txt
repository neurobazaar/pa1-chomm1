THE GADFLY




PART I



CHAPTER I

Arthur sat in the library of the theological seminary at Pisa looking
through a pile of manuscript sermons It was a hot evening in June and
the windows stood wide open with the shutters half closed for coolness
The Father Director Canon Montanelli paused a moment in his writing to
glance lovingly at the black head bent over the papers

Cant you find it carino Never mind I must rewrite the passage
Possibly it has got torn up and I have kept you all this time for
nothing

Montanellis voice was rather low but full and resonant with a silvery
purity of tone that gave to his speech a peculiar charm It was the
voice of a born orator rich in possible modulations When he spoke to
Arthur its note was always that of a caress

No Padre I must find it Im sure you put it here You will never
make it the same by rewriting

Montanelli went on with his work A sleepy cockchafer hummed drowsily
outside the window and the long melancholy call of a fruitseller
echoed down the street Fragola fragola

On the Healing of the Leper here it is Arthur came across the room
with the velvet tread that always exasperated the good folk at home
He was a slender little creature more like an Italian in a
sixteenthcentury portrait than a middleclass English lad of the
thirties From the long eyebrows and sensitive mouth to the small hands
and feet everything about him was too much chiseled overdelicate
Sitting still he might have been taken for a very pretty girl
masquerading in male attire but when he moved his lithe agility
suggested a tame panther without the claws

Is that really it What should I do without you Arthur I should
always be losing my things No I am not going to write any more now
Come out into the garden and I will help you with your work What is
the bit you couldnt understand

They went out into the still shadowy cloister garden The seminary
occupied the buildings of an old Dominican monastery and two hundred
years ago the square courtyard had been stiff and trim and the rosemary
and lavender had grown in closecut bushes between the straight box
edgings Now the whiterobed monks who had tended them were laid away
and forgotten but the scented herbs flowered still in the gracious
midsummer evening though no man gathered their blossoms for simples
any more Tufts of wild parsley and columbine filled the cracks between
the flagged footways and the well in the middle of the courtyard was
given up to ferns and matted stonecrop The roses had run wild and
their straggling suckers trailed across the paths in the box borders
flared great red poppies tall foxgloves drooped above the tangled
grasses and the old vine untrained and barren of fruit swayed from
the branches of the neglected medlartree shaking a leafy head with
slow and sad persistence

In one corner stood a huge summerflowering magnolia a tower of dark
foliage splashed here and there with milkwhite blossoms A rough
wooden bench had been placed against the trunk and on this Montanelli
sat down Arthur was studying philosophy at the university and
coming to a difficulty with a book had applied to the Padre for an
explanation of the point Montanelli was a universal encyclopaedia to
him though he had never been a pupil of the seminary

I had better go now he said when the passage had been cleared up
unless you want me for anything

I dont want to work any more but I should like you to stay a bit if
you have time

Oh yes He leaned back against the treetrunk and looked up through
the dusky branches at the first faint stars glimmering in a quiet
sky The dreamy mystical eyes deep blue under black lashes were an
inheritance from his Cornish mother and Montanelli turned his head
away that he might not see them

You are looking tired carino he said

I cant help it There was a weary sound in Arthurs voice and the
Padre noticed it at once

You should not have gone up to college so soon you were tired out with
sicknursing and being up at night I ought to have insisted on your
taking a thorough rest before you left Leghorn

Oh Padre whats the use of that I couldnt stop in that miserable
house after mother died Julia would have driven me mad

Julia was his eldest stepbrothers wife and a thorn in his side

I should not have wished you to stay with your relatives Montanelli
answered gently I am sure it would have been the worst possible thing
for you But I wish you could have accepted the invitation of your
English doctor friend if you had spent a month in his house you would
have been more fit to study

No Padre I shouldnt indeed The Warrens are very good and kind but
they dont understand and then they are sorry for meI can see it
in all their facesand they would try to console me and talk about
mother Gemma wouldnt of course she always knew what not to say even
when we were babies but the others would And it isnt only that

What is it then my son

Arthur pulled off some blossoms from a drooping foxglove stem and
crushed them nervously in his hand

I cant bear the town he began after a moments pause There are the
shops where she used to buy me toys when I was a little thing and the
walk along the shore where I used to take her until she got too ill
Wherever I go its the same thing every marketgirl comes up to me
with bunches of flowersas if I wanted them now And theres the
churchyardI had to get away it made me sick to see the place

He broke off and sat tearing the foxglove bells to pieces The silence
was so long and deep that he looked up wondering why the Padre did
not speak It was growing dark under the branches of the magnolia and
everything seemed dim and indistinct but there was light enough to show
the ghastly paleness of Montanellis face He was bending his head
down his right hand tightly clenched upon the edge of the bench Arthur
looked away with a sense of awestruck wonder It was as though he had
stepped unwittingly on to holy ground

My God he thought how small and selfish I am beside him If my
trouble were his own he couldnt feel it more

Presently Montanelli raised his head and looked round I wont press
you to go back there at all events just now he said in his most
caressing tone but you must promise me to take a thorough rest when
your vacation begins this summer I think you had better get a holiday
right away from the neighborhood of Leghorn I cant have you breaking
down in health

Where shall you go when the seminary closes Padre

I shall have to take the pupils into the hills as usual and see them
settled there But by the middle of August the subdirector will be
back from his holiday I shall try to get up into the Alps for a little
change Will you come with me I could take you for some long mountain
rambles and you would like to study the Alpine mosses and lichens But
perhaps it would be rather dull for you alone with me

Padre Arthur clasped his hands in what Julia called his
demonstrative foreign way I would give anything on earth to go away
with you OnlyI am not sure He stopped

You dont think Mr Burton would allow it

He wouldnt like it of course but he could hardly interfere I
am eighteen now and can do what I choose After all hes only my
stepbrother I dont see that I owe him obedience He was always unkind
to mother

But if he seriously objects I think you had better not defy his
wishes you may find your position at home made much harder if

Not a bit harder Arthur broke in passionately They always did hate
me and always willit doesnt matter what I do Besides how can James
seriously object to my going away with youwith my father confessor

He is a Protestant remember However you had better write to him and
we will wait to hear what he thinks But you must not be impatient my
son it matters just as much what you do whether people hate you or
love you

The rebuke was so gently given that Arthur hardly coloured under it
Yes I know he answered sighing but it is so difficult

I was sorry you could not come to me on Tuesday evening Montanelli
said abruptly introducing a new subject The Bishop of Arezzo was
here and I should have liked you to meet him

I had promised one of the students to go to a meeting at his lodgings
and they would have been expecting me

What sort of meeting

Arthur seemed embarrassed by the question Itit was nnot a rregular
meeting he said with a nervous little stammer A student had come
from Genoa and he made a speech to usaa sort oflecture

What did he lecture about

Arthur hesitated You wont ask me his name Padre will you Because I
promised

I will ask you no questions at all and if you have promised secrecy of
course you must not tell me but I think you can almost trust me by this
time

Padre of course I can He spoke aboutus and our duty to the
peopleand toour own selves and aboutwhat we might do to help

To help whom

The contadiniand

And

Italy

There was a long silence

Tell me Arthur said Montanelli turning to him and speaking very
gravely how long have you been thinking about this

Sincelast winter

Before your mothers death And did she know of it

Nno II didnt care about it then

And now youcare about it

Arthur pulled another handful of bells off the foxglove

It was this way Padre he began with his eyes on the ground When I
was preparing for the entrance examination last autumn I got to know
a good many of the students you remember Well some of them began to
talk to me aboutall these things and lent me books But I didnt care
much about it I always wanted to get home quick to mother You see she
was quite alone among them all in that dungeon of a house and Julias
tongue was enough to kill her Then in the winter when she got so ill
I forgot all about the students and their books and then you know I
left off coming to Pisa altogether I should have talked to mother if
I had thought of it but it went right out of my head Then I found out
that she was going to dieYou know I was almost constantly with her
towards the end often I would sit up the night and Gemma Warren would
come in the day to let me get to sleep Well it was in those long
nights I got thinking about the books and about what the students had
saidand wonderingwhether they were right andwhatOur Lord would
have said about it all

Did you ask Him Montanellis voice was not quite steady

Often Padre Sometimes I have prayed to Him to tell me what I must do
or to let me die with mother But I couldnt find any answer

And you never said a word to me Arthur I hoped you could have trusted
me

Padre you know I trust you But there are some things you cant talk
about to anyone Iit seemed to me that no one could help menot even
you or mother I must have my own answer straight from God You see it
is for all my life and all my soul

Montanelli turned away and stared into the dusky gloom of the magnolia
branches The twilight was so dim that his figure had a shadowy look
like a dark ghost among the darker boughs

And then he asked slowly

And thenshe died You know I had been up the last three nights with
her

He broke off and paused a moment but Montanelli did not move

All those two days before they buried her Arthur went on in a lower
voice I couldnt think about anything Then after the funeral I was
ill you remember I couldnt come to confession

Yes I remember

Well in the night I got up and went into mothers room It was all
empty there was only the great crucifix in the alcove And I thought
perhaps God would help me I knelt down and waitedall night And in
the morning when I came to my sensesPadre it isnt any use I cant
explain I cant tell you what I sawI hardly know myself But I know
that God has answered me and that I dare not disobey Him

For a moment they sat quite silent in the darkness Then Montanelli
turned and laid his hand on Arthurs shoulder

My son he said God forbid that I should say He has not spoken to
your soul But remember your condition when this thing happened and do
not take the fancies of grief or illness for His solemn call And if
indeed it has been His will to answer you out of the shadow of death
be sure that you put no false construction on His word What is this
thing you have it in your heart to do

Arthur stood up and answered slowly as though repeating a catechism

To give up my life to Italy to help in freeing her from all this
slavery and wretchedness and in driving out the Austrians that she may
be a free republic with no king but Christ

Arthur think a moment what you are saying You are not even an
Italian

That makes no difference I am myself I have seen this thing and I
belong to it

There was silence again

You spoke just now of what Christ would have said Montanelli began
slowly but Arthur interrupted him

Christ said He that loseth his life for my sake shall find it

Montanelli leaned his arm against a branch and shaded his eyes with one
hand

Sit down a moment my son he said at last

Arthur sat down and the Padre took both his hands in a strong and
steady clasp

I cannot argue with you tonight he said this has come upon me so
suddenlyI had not thoughtI must have time to think it over Later on
we will talk more definitely But for just now I want you to remember
one thing If you get into trouble over this if youdie you will
break my heart

Padre

No let me finish what I have to say I told you once that I have no
one in the world but you I think you do not fully understand what that
means It is difficult when one is so young at your age I should not
have understood Arthur you are as myas myown son to me Do you
see You are the light of my eyes and the desire of my heart I would
die to keep you from making a false step and ruining your life But
there is nothing I can do I dont ask you to make any promises to me I
only ask you to remember this and to be careful Think well before
you take an irrevocable step for my sake if not for the sake of your
mother in heaven

I will thinkandPadre pray for me and for Italy

He knelt down in silence and in silence Montanelli laid his hand on the
bent head A moment later Arthur rose kissed the hand and went softly
away across the dewy grass Montanelli sat alone under the magnolia
tree looking straight before him into the blackness

It is the vengeance of God that has fallen upon me he thought as it
fell upon David I that have defiled His sanctuary and taken the Body
of the Lord into polluted handsHe has been very patient with me and
now it is come For thou didst it secretly but I will do this thing
before all Israel and before the sun THE CHILD THAT IS BORN UNTO THEE
SHALL SURELY DIE



CHAPTER II

MR JAMES BURTON did not at all like the idea of his young stepbrother
careering about Switzerland with Montanelli But positively to forbid
a harmless botanizing tour with an elderly professor of theology would
seem to Arthur who knew nothing of the reason for the prohibition
absurdly tyrannical He would immediately attribute it to religious or
racial prejudice and the Burtons prided themselves on their
enlightened tolerance The whole family had been staunch Protestants
and Conservatives ever since Burton  Sons shipowners of London and
Leghorn had first set up in business more than a century back But
they held that English gentlemen must deal fairly even with Papists
and when the head of the house finding it dull to remain a widower had
married the pretty Catholic governess of his younger children the two
elder sons James and Thomas much as they resented the presence of
a stepmother hardly older than themselves had submitted with sulky
resignation to the will of Providence Since the fathers death the
eldest brothers marriage had further complicated an already difficult
position but both brothers had honestly tried to protect Gladys as
long as she lived from Julias merciless tongue and to do their duty
as they understood it by Arthur They did not even pretend to like the
lad and their generosity towards him showed itself chiefly in providing
him with lavish supplies of pocket money and allowing him to go his own
way

In answer to his letter accordingly Arthur received a cheque to
cover his expenses and a cold permission to do as he pleased about
his holidays He expended half his spare cash on botanical books and
pressingcases and started off with the Padre for his first Alpine
ramble

Montanelli was in lighter spirits than Arthur had seen him in for a long
while After the first shock of the conversation in the garden he had
gradually recovered his mental balance and now looked upon the case
more calmly Arthur was very young and inexperienced his decision could
hardly be as yet irrevocable Surely there was still time to win him
back by gentle persuasion and reasoning from the dangerous path upon
which he had barely entered

They had intended to stay a few days at Geneva but at the first sight
of the glaring white streets and dusty touristcrammed promenades
a little frown appeared on Arthurs face Montanelli watched him with
quiet amusement

You dont like it carino

I hardly know Its so different from what I expected Yes the lake is
beautiful and I like the shape of those hills They were standing on
Rousseaus Island and he pointed to the long severe outlines of
the Savoy side But the town looks so stiff and tidy somehowso
Protestant it has a selfsatisfied air No I dont like it it reminds
me of Julia

Montanelli laughed Poor boy what a misfortune Well we are here for
our own amusement so there is no reason why we should stop Suppose we
take a sail on the lake today and go up into the mountains tomorrow
morning

But Padre you wanted to stay here

My dear boy I have seen all these places a dozen times My holiday is
to see your pleasure Where would you like to go

If it is really the same to you I should like to follow the river back
to its source

The Rhone

No the Arve it runs so fast

Then we will go to Chamonix

They spent the afternoon drifting about in a little sailing boat The
beautiful lake produced far less impression upon Arthur than the gray
and muddy Arve He had grown up beside the Mediterranean and was
accustomed to blue ripples but he had a positive passion for swiftly
moving water and the hurried rushing of the glacier stream delighted
him beyond measure It is so much in earnest he said

Early on the following morning they started for Chamonix Arthur was in
very high spirits while driving through the fertile valley country
but when they entered upon the winding road near Cluses and the great
jagged hills closed in around them he became serious and silent
From St Martin they walked slowly up the valley stopping to sleep at
wayside chalets or tiny mountain villages and wandering on again as
their fancy directed Arthur was peculiarly sensitive to the influence
of scenery and the first waterfall that they passed threw him into
an ecstacy which was delightful to see but as they drew nearer to
the snowpeaks he passed out of this rapturous mood into one of dreamy
exaltation that Montanelli had not seen before There seemed to be a
kind of mystical relationship between him and the mountains He would
lie for hours motionless in the dark secret echoing pineforests
looking out between the straight tall trunks into the sunlit outer
world of flashing peaks and barren cliffs Montanelli watched him with a
kind of sad envy

I wish you could show me what you see carino he said one day as he
looked up from his book and saw Arthur stretched beside him on the moss
in the same attitude as an hour before gazing out with wide dilated
eyes into the glittering expanse of blue and white They had turned
aside from the highroad to sleep at a quiet village near the falls
of the Diosaz and the sun being already low in a cloudless sky had
mounted a point of pineclad rock to wait for the Alpine glow over the
dome and needles of the Mont Blanc chain Arthur raised his head with
eyes full of wonder and mystery

What I see Padre I see a great white being in a blue void that has
no beginning and no end I see it waiting age after age for the coming
of the Spirit of God I see it through a glass darkly

Montanelli sighed

I used to see those things once

Do you never see them now

Never I shall not see them any more They are there I know but I
have not the eyes to see them I see quite other things

What do you see

I carino I see a blue sky and a snowmountainthat is all when I
look up into the heights But down there it is different

He pointed to the valley below them Arthur knelt down and bent over
the sheer edge of the precipice The great pine trees dusky in the
gathering shades of evening stood like sentinels along the narrow banks
confining the river Presently the sun red as a glowing coal dipped
behind a jagged mountain peak and all the life and light deserted the
face of nature Straightway there came upon the valley something
dark and threateningsullen terrible full of spectral weapons The
perpendicular cliffs of the barren western mountains seemed like the
teeth of a monster lurking to snatch a victim and drag him down into the
maw of the deep valley black with its moaning forests The pine
trees were rows of knifeblades whispering Fall upon us and in the
gathering darkness the torrent roared and howled beating against its
rocky prison walls with the frenzy of an everlasting despair

Padre Arthur rose shuddering and drew back from the precipice It
is like hell

No my son Montanelli answered softly it is only like a human
soul

The souls of them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death

The souls of them that pass you day by day in the street

Arthur shivered looking down into the shadows A dim white mist was
hovering among the pine trees clinging faintly about the desperate
agony of the torrent like a miserable ghost that had no consolation to
give

Look Arthur said suddenly The people that walked in darkness have
seen a great light

Eastwards the snowpeaks burned in the afterglow When the red light had
faded from the summits Montanelli turned and roused Arthur with a touch
on the shoulder

Come in carino all the light is gone We shall lose our way in the
dark if we stay any longer

It is like a corpse Arthur said as he turned away from the spectral
face of the great snowpeak glimmering through the twilight

They descended cautiously among the black trees to the chalet where they
were to sleep

As Montanelli entered the room where Arthur was waiting for him at the
supper table he saw that the lad seemed to have shaken off the ghostly
fancies of the dark and to have changed into quite another creature

Oh Padre do come and look at this absurd dog It can dance on its
hind legs

He was as much absorbed in the dog and its accomplishments as he
had been in the afterglow The woman of the chalet redfaced and
whiteaproned with sturdy arms akimbo stood by smiling while he put
the animal through its tricks One can see theres not much on his mind
if he can carry on that way she said in patois to her daughter And
what a handsome lad

Arthur coloured like a schoolgirl and the woman seeing that he had
understood went away laughing at his confusion At supper he talked
of nothing but plans for excursions mountain ascents and botanizing
expeditions Evidently his dreamy fancies had not interfered with either
his spirits or his appetite

When Montanelli awoke the next morning Arthur had disappeared He had
started before daybreak for the higher pastures to help Gaspard drive
up the goats

Breakfast had not long been on the table however when he came tearing
into the room hatless with a tiny peasant girl of three years old
perched on his shoulder and a great bunch of wild flowers in his hand

Montanelli looked up smiling This was a curious contrast to the grave
and silent Arthur of Pisa or Leghorn

Where have you been you madcap Scampering all over the mountains
without any breakfast

Oh Padre it was so jolly The mountains look perfectly glorious at
sunrise and the dew is so thick Just look

He lifted for inspection a wet and muddy boot

We took some bread and cheese with us and got some goats milk up
there on the pasture oh it was nasty But Im hungry again now and I
want something for this little person too Annette wont you have some
honey

He had sat down with the child on his knee and was helping her to put
the flowers in order

No no Montanelli interposed I cant have you catching cold Run
and change your wet things Come to me Annette Where did you pick her
up

At the top of the village She belongs to the man we saw yesterdaythe
man that cobbles the communes boots Hasnt she lovely eyes Shes got
a tortoise in her pocket and she calls it Caroline

When Arthur had changed his wet socks and came down to breakfast he
found the child seated on the Padres knee chattering volubly to him
about her tortoise which she was holding upside down in a chubby hand
that monsieur might admire the wriggling legs

Look monsieur she was saying gravely in her halfintelligible
patois Look at Carolines boots

Montanelli sat playing with the child stroking her hair admiring her
darling tortoise and telling her wonderful stories The woman of the
chalet coming in to clear the table stared in amazement at the sight
of Annette turning out the pockets of the grave gentleman in clerical
dress

God teaches the little ones to know a good man she said Annette is
always afraid of strangers and see she is not shy with his reverence
at all The wonderful thing Kneel down Annette and ask the good
monsieurs blessing before he goes it will bring thee luck

I didnt know you could play with children that way Padre Arthur
said an hour later as they walked through the sunlit pastureland
That child never took her eyes off you all the time Do you know I
think

Yes

I was only going to sayit seems to me almost a pity that the Church
should forbid priests to marry I cannot quite understand why You see
the training of children is such a serious thing and it means so much
to them to be surrounded from the very beginning with good influences
that I should have thought the holier a mans vocation and the purer his
life the more fit he is to be a father I am sure Padre if you had
not been under a vowif you had marriedyour children would have
been the very

Hush

The word was uttered in a hasty whisper that seemed to deepen the
ensuing silence

Padre Arthur began again distressed by the others sombre look do
you think there is anything wrong in what I said Of course I may be
mistaken but I must think as it comes natural to me to think

Perhaps Montanelli answered gently you do not quite realize the
meaning of what you just said You will see differently in a few years
Meanwhile we had better talk about something else

It was the first break in the perfect ease and harmony that reigned
between them on this ideal holiday

From Chamonix they went on by the TeteNoire to Martigny where they
stopped to rest as the weather was stiflingly hot After dinner they
sat on the terrace of the hotel which was sheltered from the sun and
commanded a good view of the mountains Arthur brought out his specimen
box and plunged into an earnest botanical discussion in Italian

Two English artists were sitting on the terrace one sketching the
other lazily chatting It did not seem to have occurred to him that the
strangers might understand English

Leave off daubing at the landscape Willie he said and draw that
glorious Italian boy going into ecstasies over those bits of ferns Just
look at the line of his eyebrows You only need to put a crucifix for
the magnifyingglass and a Roman toga for the jacket and knickerbockers
and theres your Early Christian complete expression and all

Early Christian be hanged I sat beside that youth at dinner he was
just as ecstatic over the roast fowl as over those grubby little weeds
Hes pretty enough that olive colouring is beautiful but hes not half
so picturesque as his father

Hiswho

His father sitting there straight in front of you Do you mean to say
youve passed him over Its a perfectly magnificent face

Why you dunderheaded gotomeeting Methodist Dont you know a
Catholic priest when you see one

A priest By Jove so he is Yes I forgot vow of chastity and all
that sort of thing Well then well be charitable and suppose the boys
his nephew

What idiotic people Arthur whispered looking up with dancing eyes
Still it is kind of them to think me like you I wish I were really
your nephewPadre what is the matter How white you are

Montanelli was standing up pressing one hand to his forehead I am a
little giddy he said in a curiously faint dull tone Perhaps I was
too much in the sun this morning I will go and lie down carino its
nothing but the heat

 

After a fortnight beside the Lake of Lucerne Arthur and Montanelli
returned to Italy by the St Gothard Pass They had been fortunate as
to weather and had made several very pleasant excursions but the
first charm was gone out of their enjoyment Montanelli was continually
haunted by an uneasy thought of the more definite talk for which this
holiday was to have been the opportunity In the Arve valley he had
purposely put off all reference to the subject of which they had spoken
under the magnolia tree it would be cruel he thought to spoil the
first delights of Alpine scenery for a nature so artistic as Arthurs by
associating them with a conversation which must necessarily be painful
Ever since the day at Martigny he had said to himself each morning I
will speak today and each evening I will speak tomorrow and now
the holiday was over and he still repeated again and again Tomorrow
tomorrow A chill indefinable sense of something not quite the same
as it had been of an invisible veil falling between himself and
Arthur kept him silent until on the last evening of their holiday he
realized suddenly that he must speak now if he would speak at all They
were stopping for the night at Lugano and were to start for Pisa next
morning He would at least find out how far his darling had been drawn
into the fatal quicksand of Italian politics

The rain has stopped carino he said after sunset and this is the
only chance we shall have to see the lake Come out I want to have a
talk with you

They walked along the waters edge to a quiet spot and sat down on a
low stone wall Close beside them grew a rosebush covered with scarlet
hips one or two belated clusters of creamy blossom still hung from an
upper branch swaying mournfully and heavy with raindrops On the green
surface of the lake a little boat with white wings faintly fluttering
rocked in the dewy breeze It looked as light and frail as a tuft of
silvery dandelion seed flung upon the water High up on Monte Salvatore
the window of some shepherds hut opened a golden eye The roses hung
their heads and dreamed under the still September clouds and the water
plashed and murmured softly among the pebbles of the shore

This will be my only chance of a quiet talk with you for a long time
Montanelli began You will go back to your college work and friends
and I too shall be very busy this winter I want to understand quite
clearly what our position as regards each other is to be and so if
you He stopped for a moment and then continued more slowly If you
feel that you can still trust me as you used to do I want you to tell
me more definitely than that night in the seminary garden how far you
have gone

Arthur looked out across the water listened quietly and said nothing

I want to know if you will tell me Montanelli went on whether you
have bound yourself by a vow orin any way

There is nothing to tell dear Padre I have not bound myself but I am
bound

I dont understand

What is the use of vows They are not what binds people If you feel
in a certain way about a thing that binds you to it if you dont feel
that way nothing else can bind you

Do you mean then that this thingthisfeeling is quite irrevocable
Arthur have you thought what you are saying

Arthur turned round and looked straight into Montanellis eyes

Padre you asked me if I could trust you Can you not trust me too
Indeed if there were anything to tell I would tell it to you but
there is no use in talking about these things I have not forgotten what
you said to me that night I shall never forget it But I must go my way
and follow the light that I see

Montanelli picked a rose from the bush pulled off the petals one by
one and tossed them into the water

You are right carino Yes we will say no more about these things
it seems there is indeed no help in many wordsWell well let us go
in



CHAPTER III

THE autumn and winter passed uneventfully Arthur was reading hard and
had little spare time He contrived to get a glimpse of Montanelli once
or oftener in every week if only for a few minutes From time to time
he would come in to ask for help with some difficult book but on these
occasions the subject of study was strictly adhered to Montanelli
feeling rather than observing the slight impalpable barrier that
had come between them shrank from everything which might seem like an
attempt to retain the old close relationship Arthurs visits now caused
him more distress than pleasure so trying was the constant effort to
appear at ease and to behave as if nothing were altered Arthur for his
part noticed hardly understanding it the subtle change in the Padres
manner and vaguely feeling that it had some connection with the vexed
question of the new ideas avoided all mention of the subject with
which his thoughts were constantly filled Yet he had never
loved Montanelli so deeply as now The dim persistent sense of
dissatisfaction of spiritual emptiness which he had tried so hard to
stifle under a load of theology and ritual had vanished into nothing at
the touch of Young Italy All the unhealthy fancies born of loneliness
and sickroom watching had passed away and the doubts against which he
used to pray had gone without the need of exorcism With the awakening
of a new enthusiasm a clearer fresher religious ideal for it was more
in this light than in that of a political development that the
students movement had appeared to him had come a sense of rest and
completeness of peace on earth and good will towards men and in this
mood of solemn and tender exaltation all the world seemed to him full of
light He found a new element of something lovable in the persons whom
he had most disliked and Montanelli who for five years had been his
ideal hero was now in his eyes surrounded with an additional halo as
a potential prophet of the new faith He listened with passionate
eagerness to the Padres sermons trying to find in them some trace of
inner kinship with the republican ideal and pored over the Gospels
rejoicing in the democratic tendencies of Christianity at its origin

One day in January he called at the seminary to return a book which he
had borrowed Hearing that the Father Director was out he went up to
Montanellis private study placed the volume on its shelf and was
about to leave the room when the title of a book lying on the table
caught his eyes It was Dantes De Monarchia He began to read it and
soon became so absorbed that when the door opened and shut he did not
hear He was aroused from his preoccupation by Montanellis voice behind
him

I did not expect you today said the Padre glancing at the title of
the book I was just going to send and ask if you could come to me this
evening

Is it anything important I have an engagement for this evening but I
will miss it if

No tomorrow will do I want to see you because I am going away on
Tuesday I have been sent for to Rome

To Rome For long

The letter says till after Easter It is from the Vatican I would
have let you know at once but have been very busy settling up things
about the seminary and making arrangements for the new Director

But Padre surely you are not giving up the seminary

It will have to be so but I shall probably come back to Pisa for some
time at least

But why are you giving it up

Well it is not yet officially announced but I am offered a
bishopric

Padre Where

That is the point about which I have to go to Rome It is not yet
decided whether I am to take a see in the Apennines or to remain here
as Suffragan

And is the new Director chosen yet

Father Cardi has been nominated and arrives here tomorrow

Is not that rather sudden

Yes butThe decisions of the Vatican are sometimes not communicated
till the last moment

Do you know the new Director

Not personally but he is very highly spoken of Monsignor Belloni who
writes says that he is a man of great erudition

The seminary will miss you terribly

I dont know about the seminary but I am sure you will miss me
carino perhaps almost as much as I shall miss you

I shall indeed but I am very glad for all that

Are you I dont know that I am He sat down at the table with a weary
look on his face not the look of a man who is expecting high promotion

Are you busy this afternoon Arthur he said after a moment If not
I wish you would stay with me for a while as you cant come tonight
I am a little out of sorts I think and I want to see as much of you as
possible before leaving

Yes I can stay a bit I am due at six

One of your meetings

Arthur nodded and Montanelli changed the subject hastily

I want to speak to you about yourself he said You will need another
confessor in my absence

When you come back I may go on confessing to you may I not

My dear boy how can you ask Of course I am speaking only of the three
or four months that I shall be away Will you go to one of the Fathers
of Santa Caterina

Very well

They talked of other matters for a little while then Arthur rose

I must go Padre the students will be waiting for me

The haggard look came back to Montanellis face

Already You had almost charmed away my black mood Well goodbye

Goodbye I will be sure to come tomorrow

Try to come early so that I may have time to see you alone Father
Cardi will be here Arthur my dear boy be careful while I am gone
dont be led into doing anything rash at least before I come back You
cannot think how anxious I feel about leaving you

There is no need Padre everything is quite quiet It will be a long
time yet

Goodbye Montanelli said abruptly and sat down to his writing

The first person upon whom Arthurs eyes fell as he entered the room
where the students little gatherings were held was his old playmate
Dr Warrens daughter She was sitting in a corner by the window
listening with an absorbed and earnest face to what one of the
initiators a tall young Lombard in a threadbare coat was saying to
her During the last few months she had changed and developed greatly
and now looked a grownup young woman though the dense black plaits
still hung down her back in schoolgirl fashion She was dressed all in
black and had thrown a black scarf over her head as the room was cold
and draughty At her breast was a spray of cypress the emblem of Young
Italy The initiator was passionately describing to her the misery
of the Calabrian peasantry and she sat listening silently her chin
resting on one hand and her eyes on the ground To Arthur she seemed
a melancholy vision of Liberty mourning for the lost Republic
Julia would have seen in her only an overgrown hoyden with a sallow
complexion an irregular nose and an old stuff frock that was too short
for her

You here Jim he said coming up to her when the initiator had been
called to the other end of the room Jim was a childish corruption of
her curious baptismal name Jennifer Her Italian schoolmates called her
Gemma

She raised her head with a start

Arthur Oh I didnt know youbelonged here

And I had no idea about you Jim since when have you

You dont understand she interposed quickly I am not a member
It is only that I have done one or two little things You see I met
Biniyou know Carlo Bini

Yes of course Bini was the organizer of the Leghorn branch and all
Young Italy knew him

Well he began talking to me about these things and I asked him to
let me go to a students meeting The other day he wrote to me to
FlorenceDidnt you know I had been to Florence for the Christmas
holidays

I dont often hear from home now

Ah yes Anyhow I went to stay with the Wrights The Wrights were
old schoolfellows of hers who had moved to Florence Then Bini wrote
and told me to pass through Pisa today on my way home so that I could
come here Ah theyre going to begin

The lecture was upon the ideal Republic and the duty of the young to
fit themselves for it The lecturers comprehension of his subject was
somewhat vague but Arthur listened with devout admiration His mind at
this period was curiously uncritical when he accepted a moral ideal
he swallowed it whole without stopping to think whether it was quite
digestible When the lecture and the long discussion which followed it
were finished and the students began to disperse he went up to Gemma
who was still sitting in the corner of the room

Let me walk with you Jim Where are you staying

With Marietta

Your fathers old housekeeper

Yes she lives a good way from here

They walked for some time in silence Then Arthur said suddenly

You are seventeen now arent you

I was seventeen in October

I always knew you would not grow up like other girls and begin wanting
to go to balls and all that sort of thing Jim dear I have so often
wondered whether you would ever come to be one of us

So have I

You said you had done things for Bini I didnt know you even knew
him

It wasnt for Bini it was for the other one

Which other one

The one that was talking to me tonightBolla

Do you know him well Arthur put in with a little touch of jealousy
Bolla was a sore subject with him there had been a rivalry between them
about some work which the committee of Young Italy had finally intrusted
to Bolla declaring Arthur too young and inexperienced

I know him pretty well and I like him very much He has been staying
in Leghorn

I know he went there in November

Because of the steamers Arthur dont you think your house would be
safer than ours for that work Nobody would suspect a rich shipping
family like yours and you know everyone at the docks

Hush not so loud dear So it was in your house the books from
Marseilles were hidden

Only for one day Oh perhaps I oughtnt to have told you

Why not You know I belong to the society Gemma dear there is
nothing in all the world that would make me so happy as for you to join
usyou and the Padre

Your Padre Surely he

No he thinks differently But I have sometimes fanciedthat
ishopedI dont know

But Arthur hes a priest

What of that There are priests in the societytwo of them write in
the paper And why not It is the mission of the priesthood to lead the
world to higher ideals and aims and what else does the society try
to do It is after all more a religious and moral question than a
political one If people are fit to be free and responsible citizens no
one can keep them enslaved

Gemma knit her brows It seems to me Arthur she said that theres
a muddle somewhere in your logic A priest teaches religious doctrine I
dont see what that has to do with getting rid of the Austrians

A priest is a teacher of Christianity and the greatest of all
revolutionists was Christ

Do you know I was talking about priests to father the other day and
he said

Gemma your father is a Protestant

After a little pause she looked round at him frankly

Look here we had better leave this subject alone You are always
intolerant when you talk about Protestants

I didnt mean to be intolerant But I think Protestants are generally
intolerant when they talk about priests

I dare say Anyhow we have so often quarreled over this subject
that it is not worth while to begin again What did you think of the
lecture

I liked it very muchespecially the last part I was glad he spoke so
strongly about the need of living the Republic not dreaming of it It
is as Christ said The Kingdom of Heaven is within you

It was just that part that I didnt like He talked so much of the
wonderful things we ought to think and feel and be but he never told us
practically what we ought to do

When the time of crisis comes there will be plenty for us to do but we
must be patient these great changes are not made in a day

The longer a thing is to take doing the more reason to begin at once
You talk about being fit for freedomdid you ever know anyone so fit
for it as your mother Wasnt she the most perfectly angelic woman you
ever saw And what use was all her goodness She was a slave till the
day she diedbullied and worried and insulted by your brother James and
his wife It would have been much better for her if she had not been so
sweet and patient they would never have treated her so Thats just the
way with Italy its not patience thats wantedits for somebody to
get up and defend themselves

Jim dear if anger and passion could have saved Italy she would have
been free long ago it is not hatred that she needs it is love

As he said the word a sudden flush went up to his forehead and died out
again Gemma did not see it she was looking straight before her with
knitted brows and set mouth

You think I am wrong Arthur she said after a pause but I am right
and you will grow to see it some day This is the house Will you come
in

No its late Goodnight dear

He was standing on the doorstep clasping her hand in both of his

For God and the people

Slowly and gravely she completed the unfinished motto

Now and forever

Then she pulled away her hand and ran into the house When the door had
closed behind her he stooped and picked up the spray of cypress which
had fallen from her breast



CHAPTER IV

ARTHUR went back to his lodgings feeling as though he had wings He was
absolutely cloudlessly happy At the meeting there had been hints of
preparations for armed insurrection and now Gemma was a comrade and he
loved her They could work together possibly even die together for the
Republic that was to be The blossoming time of their hope was come and
the Padre would see it and believe

The next morning however he awoke in a soberer mood and remembered
that Gemma was going to Leghorn and the Padre to Rome January
February Marchthree long months to Easter And if Gemma should
fall under Protestant influences at home in Arthurs vocabulary
Protestant stood for PhilistineNo Gemma would never learn to
flirt and simper and captivate tourists and baldheaded shipowners like
the other English girls in Leghorn she was made of different stuff But
she might be very miserable she was so young so friendless so utterly
alone among all those wooden people If only mother had lived

In the evening he went to the seminary where he found Montanelli
entertaining the new Director and looking both tired and bored Instead
of lighting up as usual at the sight of Arthur the Padres face grew
darker

This is the student I spoke to you about he said introducing Arthur
stiffly I shall be much obliged if you will allow him to continue
using the library

Father Cardi a benevolentlooking elderly priest at once began talking
to Arthur about the Sapienza with an ease and familiarity which showed
him to be well acquainted with college life The conversation soon
drifted into a discussion of university regulations a burning question
of that day To Arthurs great delight the new Director spoke strongly
against the custom adopted by the university authorities of constantly
worrying the students by senseless and vexatious restrictions

I have had a good deal of experience in guiding young people he said
and I make it a rule never to prohibit anything without a good reason
There are very few young men who will give much trouble if proper
consideration and respect for their personality are shown to them But
of course the most docile horse will kick if you are always jerking at
the rein

Arthur opened his eyes wide he had not expected to hear the students
cause pleaded by the new Director Montanelli took no part in the
discussion its subject apparently did not interest him The
expression of his face was so unutterably hopeless and weary that Father
Cardi broke off suddenly

I am afraid I have overtired you Canon You must forgive my
talkativeness I am hot upon this subject and forget that others may
grow weary of it

On the contrary I was much interested Montanelli was not given to
stereotyped politeness and his tone jarred uncomfortably upon Arthur

When Father Cardi went to his own room Montanelli turned to Arthur with
the intent and brooding look that his face had worn all the evening

Arthur my dear boy he began slowly I have something to tell you

He must have had bad news flashed through Arthurs mind as he looked
anxiously at the haggard face There was a long pause

How do you like the new Director Montanelli asked suddenly

The question was so unexpected that for a moment Arthur was at a loss
how to reply to it

II like him very much I thinkat leastno I am not quite sure
that I do But it is difficult to say after seeing a person once

Montanelli sat beating his hand gently on the arm of his chair a habit
with him when anxious or perplexed

About this journey to Rome he began again if you think there is
anywellif you wish it Arthur I will write and say I cannot go

Padre But the Vatican

The Vatican will find someone else I can send apologies

But why I cant understand

Montanelli drew one hand across his forehead

I am anxious about you Things keep coming into my headand after all
there is no need for me to go

But the bishopric

Oh Arthur what shall it profit me if I gain a bishopric and lose

He broke off Arthur had never seen him like this before and was
greatly troubled

I cant understand he said Padre if you could explain to me
moremore definitely what it is you think

I think nothing I am haunted with a horrible fear Tell me is there
any special danger

He has heard something Arthur thought remembering the whispers of
a projected revolt But the secret was not his to tell and he merely
answered What special danger should there be

Dont question meanswer me Montanellis voice was almost harsh in
its eagerness Are you in danger I dont want to know your secrets
only tell me that

We are all in Gods hands Padre anything may always happen But I
know of no reason why I should not be here alive and safe when you come
back

When I come backListen carino I will leave it in your hands You
need give me no reason only say to me Stay and I will give up this
journey There will be no injury to anyone and I shall feel you are
safer if I have you beside me

This kind of morbid fancifulness was so foreign to Montanellis
character that Arthur looked at him with grave anxiety

Padre I am sure you are not well Of course you must go to Rome
and try to have a thorough rest and get rid of your sleeplessness and
headaches

Very well Montanelli interrupted as if tired of the subject I will
start by the early coach tomorrow morning

Arthur looked at him wondering

You had something to tell me he said

No no nothing morenothing of any consequence There was a
startled almost terrified look in his face

A few days after Montanellis departure Arthur went to fetch a book from
the seminary library and met Father Cardi on the stairs

Ah Mr Burton exclaimed the Director the very person I wanted
Please come in and help me out of a difficulty

He opened the study door and Arthur followed him into the room with
a foolish secret sense of resentment It seemed hard to see this dear
study the Padres own private sanctum invaded by a stranger

I am a terrible bookworm said the Director and my first act when I
got here was to examine the library It seems very interesting but I do
not understand the system by which it is catalogued

The catalogue is imperfect many of the best books have been added to
the collection lately

Can you spare half an hour to explain the arrangement to me

They went into the library and Arthur carefully explained the
catalogue When he rose to take his hat the Director interfered
laughing

No no I cant have you rushing off in that way It is Saturday and
quite time for you to leave off work till Monday morning Stop and have
supper with me now I have kept you so late I am quite alone and shall
be glad of company

His manner was so bright and pleasant that Arthur felt at ease with him
at once After some desultory conversation the Director inquired how
long he had known Montanelli

For about seven years He came back from China when I was twelve years
old

Ah yes It was there that he gained his reputation as a missionary
preacher Have you been his pupil ever since

He began teaching me a year later about the time when I first
confessed to him Since I have been at the Sapienza he has still gone on
helping me with anything I wanted to study that was not in the regular
course He has been very kind to meyou can hardly imagine how kind

I can well believe it he is a man whom no one can fail to admirea
most noble and beautiful nature I have met priests who were out in
China with him and they had no words high enough to praise his energy
and courage under all hardships and his unfailing devotion You are
fortunate to have had in your youth the help and guidance of such a man
I understood from him that you have lost both parents

Yes my father died when I was a child and my mother a year ago

Have you brothers and sisters

No I have stepbrothers but they were business men when I was in the
nursery

You must have had a lonely childhood perhaps you value Canon
Montanellis kindness the more for that By the way have you chosen a
confessor for the time of his absence

I thought of going to one of the fathers of Santa Caterina if they
have not too many penitents

Will you confess to me

Arthur opened his eyes in wonder

Reverend Father of course Ishould be glad only

Only the Director of a theological seminary does not usually receive
lay penitents That is quite true But I know Canon Montanelli takes
a great interest in you and I fancy he is a little anxious on your
behalfjust as I should be if I were leaving a favourite pupiland
would like to know you were under the spiritual guidance of his
colleague And to be quite frank with you my son I like you and
should be glad to give you any help I can

If you put it that way of course I shall be very grateful for your
guidance

Then you will come to me next month Thats right And run in to see
me my lad when you have time any evening

 

Shortly before Easter Montanellis appointment to the little see of
Brisighella in the Etruscan Apennines was officially announced He
wrote to Arthur from Rome in a cheerful and tranquil spirit evidently
his depression was passing over You must come to see me every
vacation he wrote and I shall often be coming to Pisa so I hope to
see a good deal of you if not so much as I should wish

Dr Warren had invited Arthur to spend the Easter holidays with him and
his children instead of in the dreary ratridden old place where Julia
now reigned supreme Enclosed in the letter was a short note scrawled
in Gemmas childish irregular handwriting begging him to come if
possible as I want to talk to you about something Still more
encouraging was the whispered communication passing around from student
to student in the university everyone was to be prepared for great
things after Easter

All this had put Arthur into a state of rapturous anticipation in which
the wildest improbabilities hinted at among the students seemed to him
natural and likely to be realized within the next two months

He arranged to go home on Thursday in Passion week and to spend the
first days of the vacation there that the pleasure of visiting the
Warrens and the delight of seeing Gemma might not unfit him for the
solemn religious meditation demanded by the Church from all her children
at this season He wrote to Gemma promising to come on Easter Monday
and went up to his bedroom on Wednesday night with a soul at peace

He knelt down before the crucifix Father Cardi had promised to receive
him in the morning and for this his last confession before the Easter
communion he must prepare himself by long and earnest prayer Kneeling
with clasped hands and bent head he looked back over the month and
reckoned up the miniature sins of impatience carelessness hastiness
of temper which had left their faint small spots upon the whiteness of
his soul Beyond these he could find nothing in this month he had
been too happy to sin much He crossed himself and rising began to
undress

As he unfastened his shirt a scrap of paper slipped from it and
fluttered to the floor It was Gemmas letter which he had worn all
day upon his neck He picked it up unfolded it and kissed the
dear scribble then began folding the paper up again with a dim
consciousness of having done something very ridiculous when he noticed
on the back of the sheet a postscript which he had not read before
Be sure and come as soon as possible it ran for I want you to meet
Bolla He has been staying here and we have read together every day

The hot colour went up to Arthurs forehead as he read

Always Bolla What was he doing in Leghorn again And why should Gemma
want to read with him Had he bewitched her with his smuggling It had
been quite easy to see at the meeting in January that he was in love
with her that was why he had been so earnest over his propaganda And
now he was close to herreading with her every day

Arthur suddenly threw the letter aside and knelt down again before the
crucifix And this was the soul that was preparing for absolution for
the Easter sacramentthe soul at peace with God and itself and all the
world A soul capable of sordid jealousies and suspicions of selfish
animosities and ungenerous hatredand against a comrade He covered his
face with both hands in bitter humiliation Only five minutes ago he
had been dreaming of martyrdom and now he had been guilty of a mean and
petty thought like this

When he entered the seminary chapel on Thursday morning he found Father
Cardi alone After repeating the Confiteor he plunged at once into the
subject of his last nights backsliding

My father I accuse myself of the sins of jealousy and anger and of
unworthy thoughts against one who has done me no wrong

Farther Cardi knew quite well with what kind of penitent he had to deal
He only said softly

You have not told me all my son

Father the man against whom I have thought an unchristian thought is
one whom I am especially bound to love and honour

One to whom you are bound by ties of blood

By a still closer tie

By what tie my son

By that of comradeship

Comradeship in what

In a great and holy work

A little pause

And your anger against thiscomrade your jealousy of him was called
forth by his success in that work being greater than yours

Iyes partly I envied him his experiencehis usefulness And
thenI thoughtI fearedthat he would take from me the heart of the
girl Ilove

And this girl that you love is she a daughter of the Holy Church

No she is a Protestant

A heretic

Arthur clasped his hands in great distress Yes a heretic he
repeated We were brought up together our mothers were
friendsand Ienvied him because I saw that he loves her too and
becausebecause

My son said Father Cardi speaking after a moments silence slowly
and gravely you have still not told me all there is more than this
upon your soul

Father I He faltered and broke off again

The priest waited silently

I envied him because the societythe Young Italythat I belong
to

Yes

Intrusted him with a work that I had hopedwould be given to me that
I had thought myselfspecially adapted for

What work

The taking in of bookspolitical booksfrom the steamers that bring
themand finding a hiding place for themin the town

And this work was given by the party to your rival

To Bollaand I envied him

And he gave you no cause for this feeling You do not accuse him of
having neglected the mission intrusted to him

No father he has worked bravely and devotedly he is a true patriot
and has deserved nothing but love and respect from me

Father Cardi pondered

My son if there is within you a new light a dream of some great work
to be accomplished for your fellowmen a hope that shall lighten the
burdens of the weary and oppressed take heed how you deal with the most
precious blessing of God All good things are of His giving and of His
giving is the new birth If you have found the way of sacrifice the way
that leads to peace if you have joined with loving comrades to bring
deliverance to them that weep and mourn in secret then see to it that
your soul be free from envy and passion and your heart as an altar where
the sacred fire burns eternally Remember that this is a high and holy
thing and that the heart which would receive it must be purified from
every selfish thought This vocation is as the vocation of a priest
it is not for the love of a woman nor for the moment of a fleeting
passion it is FOR GOD AND THE PEOPLE it is NOW AND FOREVER

Ah Arthur started and clasped his hands he had almost burst out
sobbing at the motto Father you give us the sanction of the Church
Christ is on our side

My son the priest answered solemnly Christ drove the moneychangers
out of the Temple for His House shall be called a House of Prayer and
they had made it a den of thieves

After a long silence Arthur whispered tremulously

And Italy shall be His Temple when they are driven out

He stopped and the soft answer came back

The earth and the fulness thereof are mine saith the Lord



CHAPTER V

THAT afternoon Arthur felt the need of a long walk He intrusted his
luggage to a fellowstudent and went to Leghorn on foot

The day was damp and cloudy but not cold and the low level country
seemed to him fairer than he had ever known it to look before He had a
sense of delight in the soft elasticity of the wet grass under his
feet and in the shy wondering eyes of the wild spring flowers by the
roadside In a thornacacia bush at the edge of a little strip of wood
a bird was building a nest and flew up as he passed with a startled cry
and a quick fluttering of brown wings

He tried to keep his mind fixed upon the devout meditations proper to
the eve of Good Friday But thoughts of Montanelli and Gemma got so
much in the way of this devotional exercise that at last he gave up the
attempt and allowed his fancy to drift away to the wonders and glories
of the coming insurrection and to the part in it that he had allotted
to his two idols The Padre was to be the leader the apostle the
prophet before whose sacred wrath the powers of darkness were to flee
and at whose feet the young defenders of Liberty were to learn
afresh the old doctrines the old truths in their new and unimagined
significance

And Gemma Oh Gemma would fight at the barricades She was made of the
clay from which heroines are moulded she would be the perfect comrade
the maiden undefiled and unafraid of whom so many poets have dreamed
She would stand beside him shoulder to shoulder rejoicing under the
winged deathstorm and they would die together perhaps in the moment
of victorywithout doubt there would be a victory Of his love he would
tell her nothing he would say no word that might disturb her peace or
spoil her tranquil sense of comradeship She was to him a holy thing
a spotless victim to be laid upon the altar as a burntoffering for the
deliverance of the people and who was he that he should enter into the
white sanctuary of a soul that knew no other love than God and Italy

God and ItalyThen came a sudden drop from the clouds as he entered
the great dreary house in the Street of Palaces and Julias butler
immaculate calm and politely disapproving as ever confronted him upon
the stairs

Goodevening Gibbons are my brothers in

Mr Thomas is in sir and Mrs Burton They are in the drawing room

Arthur went in with a dull sense of oppression What a dismal house
it was The flood of life seemed to roll past and leave it always just
above highwater mark Nothing in it ever changedneither the people
nor the family portraits nor the heavy furniture and ugly plate nor
the vulgar ostentation of riches nor the lifeless aspect of everything
Even the flowers on the brass stands looked like painted metal flowers
that had never known the stirring of young sap within them in the warm
spring days Julia dressed for dinner and waiting for visitors in the
drawing room which was to her the centre of existence might have sat
for a fashionplate just as she was with her wooden smile and flaxen
ringlets and the lapdog on her knee

How do you do Arthur she said stiffly giving him the tips of her
fingers for a moment and then transferring them to the more congenial
contact of the lapdogs silken coat I hope you are quite well and
have made satisfactory progress at college

Arthur murmured the first commonplace that he could think of at the
moment and relapsed into uncomfortable silence The arrival of
James in his most pompous mood and accompanied by a stiff elderly
shippingagent did not improve matters and when Gibbons announced that
dinner was served Arthur rose with a little sigh of relief

I wont come to dinner Julia If youll excuse me I will go to my
room

Youre overdoing that fasting my boy said Thomas I am sure youll
make yourself ill

Oh no Goodnight

In the corridor Arthur met the under housemaid and asked her to knock at
his door at six in the morning

The signorino is going to church

Yes Goodnight Teresa

He went into his room It had belonged to his mother and the alcove
opposite the window had been fitted up during her long illness as an
oratory A great crucifix on a black pedestal occupied the middle of the
altar and before it hung a little Roman lamp This was the room where
she had died Her portrait was on the wall beside the bed and on the
table stood a china bowl which had been hers filled with a great bunch
of her favourite violets It was just a year since her death and the
Italian servants had not forgotten her

He took out of his portmanteau a framed picture carefully wrapped up
It was a crayon portrait of Montanelli which had come from Rome only a
few days before He was unwrapping this precious treasure when Julias
page brought in a suppertray on which the old Italian cook who had
served Gladys before the harsh new mistress came had placed such
little delicacies as she considered her dear signorino might permit
himself to eat without infringing the rules of the Church Arthur
refused everything but a piece of bread and the page a nephew of
Gibbons lately arrived from England grinned significantly as he
carried out the tray He had already joined the Protestant camp in the
servants hall

Arthur went into the alcove and knelt down before the crucifix trying
to compose his mind to the proper attitude for prayer and meditation
But this he found difficult to accomplish He had as Thomas said
rather overdone the Lenten privations and they had gone to his head
like strong wine Little quivers of excitement went down his back and
the crucifix swam in a misty cloud before his eyes It was only after a
long litany mechanically repeated that he succeeded in recalling his
wandering imagination to the mystery of the Atonement At last sheer
physical weariness conquered the feverish agitation of his nerves and
he lay down to sleep in a calm and peaceful mood free from all unquiet
or disturbing thoughts

He was fast asleep when a sharp impatient knock came at his door Ah
Teresa he thought turning over lazily The knock was repeated and he
awoke with a violent start

Signorino signorino cried a mans voice in Italian get up for the
love of God

Arthur jumped out of bed

What is the matter Who is it

Its I Gian Battista Get up quick for Our Ladys sake

Arthur hurriedly dressed and opened the door As he stared in perplexity
at the coachmans pale terrified face the sound of tramping feet and
clanking metal came along the corridor and he suddenly realized the
truth

For me he asked coolly

For you Oh signorino make haste What have you to hide See I can
put

I have nothing to hide Do my brothers know

The first uniform appeared at the turn of the passage

The signor has been called all the house is awake Alas what a
misfortunewhat a terrible misfortune And on Good Friday Holy Saints
have pity

Gian Battista burst into tears Arthur moved a few steps forward and
waited for the gendarmes who came clattering along followed by a
shivering crowd of servants in various impromptu costumes As the
soldiers surrounded Arthur the master and mistress of the house
brought up the rear of this strange procession he in dressing gown and
slippers she in a long peignoir with her hair in curlpapers

There is sure another flood toward and these couples are coming to
the ark Here comes a pair of very strange beasts

The quotation flashed across Arthurs mind as he looked at the
grotesque figures He checked a laugh with a sense of its jarring
incongruitythis was a time for worthier thoughts Ave Maria Regina
Coeli he whispered and turned his eyes away that the bobbing of
Julias curlpapers might not again tempt him to levity

Kindly explain to me said Mr Burton approaching the officer of
gendarmerie what is the meaning of this violent intrusion into a
private house I warn you that unless you are prepared to furnish me
with a satisfactory explanation I shall feel bound to complain to the
English Ambassador

I presume replied the officer stiffly that you will recognize this
as a sufficient explanation the English Ambassador certainly will
He pulled out a warrant for the arrest of Arthur Burton student of
philosophy and handing it to James added coldly If you wish for
any further explanation you had better apply in person to the chief of
police

Julia snatched the paper from her husband glanced over it and flew at
Arthur like nothing else in the world but a fashionable lady in a rage

So its you that have disgraced the family she screamed setting all
the rabble in the town gaping and staring as if the thing were a show
So you have turned jailbird now with all your piety Its what we
might have expected from that Popish womans child

You must not speak to a prisoner in a foreign language madam the
officer interrupted but his remonstrance was hardly audible under the
torrent of Julias vociferous English

Just what we might have expected Fasting and prayer and saintly
meditation and this is what was underneath it all I thought that would
be the end of it

Dr Warren had once compared Julia to a salad into which the cook had
upset the vinegar cruet The sound of her thin hard voice set Arthurs
teeth on edge and the simile suddenly popped up in his memory

Theres no use in this kind of talk he said You need not be afraid
of any unpleasantness everyone will understand that you are all quite
innocent I suppose gentlemen you want to search my things I have
nothing to hide

While the gendarmes ransacked the room reading his letters examining
his college papers and turning out drawers and boxes he sat waiting
on the edge of the bed a little flushed with excitement but in no
way distressed The search did not disquiet him He had always burned
letters which could possibly compromise anyone and beyond a few
manuscript verses half revolutionary half mystical and two or three
numbers of Young Italy the gendarmes found nothing to repay them for
their trouble Julia after a long resistance yielded to the entreaties
of her brotherinlaw and went back to bed sweeping past Arthur with
magnificent disdain James meekly following

When they had left the room Thomas who all this while had been
tramping up and down trying to look indifferent approached the officer
and asked permission to speak to the prisoner Receiving a nod in
answer he went up to Arthur and muttered in a rather husky voice

I say this is an infernally awkward business Im very sorry about
it

Arthur looked up with a face as serene as a summer morning You have
always been good to me he said Theres nothing to be sorry about I
shall be safe enough

Look here Arthur Thomas gave his moustache a hard pull and plunged
head first into the awkward question Isall this anything to do
withmoney Because if it is I

With money Why no What could it have to do

Then its some political tomfoolery I thought so Well dont you get
down in the mouthand never mind all the stuff Julia talks Its only
her spiteful tongue and if you want helpcash or anythinglet me
know will you

Arthur held out his hand in silence and Thomas left the room with a
carefully madeup expression of unconcern that rendered his face more
stolid than ever

The gendarmes meanwhile had finished their search and the officer in
charge requested Arthur to put on his outdoor clothes He obeyed at once
and turned to leave the room then stopped with sudden hesitation It
seemed hard to take leave of his mothers oratory in the presence of
these officials

Have you any objection to leaving the room for a moment he asked
You see that I cannot escape and that there is nothing to conceal

I am sorry but it is forbidden to leave a prisoner alone

Very well it doesnt matter

He went into the alcove and kneeling down kissed the feet and
pedestal of the crucifix whispering softly Lord keep me faithful
unto death

When he rose the officer was standing by the table examining
Montanellis portrait Is this a relative of yours he asked

No it is my confessor the new Bishop of Brisighella

On the staircase the Italian servants were waiting anxious and
sorrowful They all loved Arthur for his own sake and his mothers and
crowded round him kissing his hands and dress with passionate grief
Gian Battista stood by the tears dripping down his gray moustache None
of the Burtons came out to take leave of him Their coldness accentuated
the tenderness and sympathy of the servants and Arthur was near to
breaking down as he pressed the hands held out to him

Goodbye Gian Battista Kiss the little ones for me Goodbye Teresa
Pray for me all of you and God keep you Goodbye goodbye

He ran hastily downstairs to the front door A moment later only a
little group of silent men and sobbing women stood on the doorstep
watching the carriage as it drove away



CHAPTER VI

ARTHUR was taken to the huge mediaeval fortress at the harbours mouth
He found prison life fairly endurable His cell was unpleasantly damp
and dark but he had been brought up in a palace in the Via Borra and
neither close air rats nor foul smells were novelties to him The
food also was both bad and insufficient but James soon obtained
permission to send him all the necessaries of life from home He was
kept in solitary confinement and though the vigilance of the
warders was less strict than he had expected he failed to obtain any
explanation of the cause of his arrest Nevertheless the tranquil frame
of mind in which he had entered the fortress did not change Not being
allowed books he spent his time in prayer and devout meditation and
waited without impatience or anxiety for the further course of events

One day a soldier unlocked the door of his cell and called to him This
way please After two or three questions to which he got no answer
but Talking is forbidden Arthur resigned himself to the inevitable
and followed the soldier through a labyrinth of courtyards corridors
and stairs all more or less mustysmelling into a large light room in
which three persons in military uniform sat at a long table covered with
green baize and littered with papers chatting in a languid desultory
way They put on a stiff business air as he came in and the oldest of
them a foppishlooking man with gray whiskers and a colonels uniform
pointed to a chair on the other side of the table and began the
preliminary interrogation

Arthur had expected to be threatened abused and sworn at and had
prepared himself to answer with dignity and patience but he was
pleasantly disappointed The colonel was stiff cold and formal
but perfectly courteous The usual questions as to his name age
nationality and social position were put and answered and the replies
written down in monotonous succession He was beginning to feel bored
and impatient when the colonel asked

And now Mr Burton what do you know about Young Italy

I know that it is a society which publishes a newspaper in Marseilles
and circulates it in Italy with the object of inducing people to revolt
and drive the Austrian army out of the country

You have read this paper I think

Yes I am interested in the subject

When you read it you realized that you were committing an illegal
action

Certainly

Where did you get the copies which were found in your room

That I cannot tell you

Mr Burton you must not say I cannot tell here you are bound to
answer my questions

I will not then if you object to cannot

You will regret it if you permit yourself to use such expressions
remarked the colonel As Arthur made no reply he went on

I may as well tell you that evidence has come into our hands proving
your connection with this society to be much more intimate than is
implied by the mere reading of forbidden literature It will be to your
advantage to confess frankly In any case the truth will be sure to come
out and you will find it useless to screen yourself behind evasion and
denials

I have no desire to screen myself What is it you want to know

Firstly how did you a foreigner come to be implicated in matters of
this kind

I thought about the subject and read everything I could get hold of
and formed my own conclusions

Who persuaded you to join this society

No one I wished to join it

You are shillyshallying with me said the colonel sharply his
patience was evidently beginning to give out No one can join a society
by himself To whom did you communicate your wish to join it

Silence

Will you have the kindness to answer me

Not when you ask questions of that kind

Arthur spoke sullenly a curious nervous irritability was taking
possession of him He knew by this time that many arrests had been made
in both Leghorn and Pisa and though still ignorant of the extent of
the calamity he had already heard enough to put him into a fever of
anxiety for the safety of Gemma and his other friends The studied
politeness of the officers the dull game of fencing and parrying of
insidious questions and evasive answers worried and annoyed him and
the clumsy tramping backward and forward of the sentinel outside the
door jarred detestably upon his ear

Oh by the bye when did you last meet Giovanni Bolla asked the
colonel after a little more bandying of words Just before you left
Pisa was it

I know no one of that name

What Giovanni Bolla Surely you know hima tall young fellow closely
shaven Why he is one of your fellowstudents

There are many students in the university whom I dont know

Oh but you must know Bolla surely Look this is his handwriting You
see he knows you well enough

The colonel carelessly handed him a paper headed Protocol and
signed Giovanni Bolla Glancing down it Arthur came upon his own
name He looked up in surprise Am I to read it

Yes you may as well it concerns you

He began to read while the officers sat silently watching his face The
document appeared to consist of depositions in answer to a long string
of questions Evidently Bolla too must have been arrested The first
depositions were of the usual stereotyped character then followed
a short account of Bollas connection with the society of the
dissemination of prohibited literature in Leghorn and of the students
meetings Next came Among those who joined us was a young Englishman
Arthur Burton who belongs to one of the rich shipowning families

The blood rushed into Arthurs face Bolla had betrayed him Bolla who
had taken upon himself the solemn duties of an initiatorBolla who had
converted Gemmawho was in love with her He laid down the paper and
stared at the floor

I hope that little document has refreshed your memory hinted the
colonel politely

Arthur shook his head I know no one of that name he repeated in a
dull hard voice There must be some mistake

Mistake Oh nonsense Come Mr Burton chivalry and quixotism are
very fine things in their way but theres no use in overdoing them
Its an error all you young people fall into at first Come think What
good is it for you to compromise yourself and spoil your prospects in
life over a simple formality about a man that has betrayed you You see
yourself he wasnt so particular as to what he said about you

A faint shade of something like mockery had crept into the colonels
voice Arthur looked up with a start a sudden light flashed upon his
mind

Its a lie he cried out Its a forgery I can see it in your face
you cowardlyYouve got some prisoner there you want to compromise
or a trap you want to drag me into You are a forger and a liar and a
scoundrel

Silence shouted the colonel starting up in a rage his two
colleagues were already on their feet Captain Tommasi he went on
turning to one of them ring for the guard if you please and have
this young gentleman put in the punishment cell for a few days He wants
a lesson I see to bring him to reason

The punishment cell was a dark damp filthy hole under ground Instead
of bringing Arthur to reason it thoroughly exasperated him His
luxurious home had rendered him daintily fastidious about personal
cleanliness and the first effect of the slimy vermincovered walls
the floor heaped with accumulations of filth and garbage the fearful
stench of fungi and sewage and rotting wood was strong enough to have
satisfied the offended officer When he was pushed in and the door
locked behind him he took three cautious steps forward with outstretched
hands shuddering with disgust as his fingers came into contact with
the slippery wall and groped in the dense blackness for some spot less
filthy than the rest in which to sit down

The long day passed in unbroken blackness and silence and the night
brought no change In the utter void and absence of all external
impressions he gradually lost the consciousness of time and when
on the following morning a key was turned in the door lock and the
frightened rats scurried past him squeaking he started up in a sudden
panic his heart throbbing furiously and a roaring noise in his ears as
though he had been shut away from light and sound for months instead of
hours

The door opened letting in a feeble lantern gleama flood of blinding
light it seemed to himand the head warder entered carrying a piece
of bread and a mug of water Arthur made a step forward he was quite
convinced that the man had come to let him out Before he had time to
speak the warder put the bread and mug into his hands turned round and
went away without a word locking the door again

Arthur stamped his foot upon the ground For the first time in his life
he was savagely angry But as the hours went by the consciousness of
time and place gradually slipped further and further away The blackness
seemed an illimitable thing with no beginning and no end and life had
as it were stopped for him On the evening of the third day when the
door was opened and the head warder appeared on the threshold with a
soldier he looked up dazed and bewildered shading his eyes from the
unaccustomed light and vaguely wondering how many hours or weeks he had
been in this grave

This way please said the cool business voice of the warder Arthur
rose and moved forward mechanically with a strange unsteadiness
swaying and stumbling like a drunkard He resented the warders attempt
to help him up the steep narrow steps leading to the courtyard but as
he reached the highest step a sudden giddiness came over him so that he
staggered and would have fallen backwards had the warder not caught him
by the shoulder

 

There hell be all right now said a cheerful voice they most of
them go off this way coming out into the air

Arthur struggled desperately for breath as another handful of water
was dashed into his face The blackness seemed to fall away from him
in pieces with a rushing noise then he woke suddenly into full
consciousness and pushing aside the warders arm walked along the
corridor and up the stairs almost steadily They stopped for a moment in
front of a door then it opened and before he realized where they were
taking him he was in the brightly lighted interrogation room staring in
confused wonder at the table and the papers and the officers sitting in
their accustomed places

Ah its Mr Burton said the colonel I hope we shall be able to
talk more comfortably now Well and how do you like the dark cell Not
quite so luxurious as your brothers drawing room is it eh

Arthur raised his eyes to the colonels smiling face He was seized by
a frantic desire to spring at the throat of this graywhiskered fop and
tear it with his teeth Probably something of this kind was visible in
his face for the colonel added immediately in a quite different tone

Sit down Mr Burton and drink some water you are excited

Arthur pushed aside the glass of water held out to him and leaning his
arms on the table rested his forehead on one hand and tried to
collect his thoughts The colonel sat watching him keenly noting with
experienced eyes the unsteady hands and lips the hair dripping with
water the dim gaze that told of physical prostration and disordered
nerves

Now Mr Burton he said after a few minutes we will start at the
point where we left off and as there has been a certain amount of
unpleasantness between us I may as well begin by saying that I for my
part have no desire to be anything but indulgent with you If you will
behave properly and reasonably I assure you that we shall not treat you
with any unnecessary harshness

What do you want me to do

Arthur spoke in a hard sullen voice quite different from his natural
tone

I only want you to tell us frankly in a straightforward and honourable
manner what you know of this society and its adherents First of all
how long have you known Bolla

I never met him in my life I know nothing whatever about him

Really Well we will return to that subject presently I think you
know a young man named Carlo Bini

I never heard of such a person

That is very extraordinary What about Francesco Neri

I never heard the name

But here is a letter in your handwriting addressed to him Look

Arthur glanced carelessly at the letter and laid it aside

Do you recognize that letter

No

You deny that it is in your writing

I deny nothing I have no recollection of it

Perhaps you remember this one

A second letter was handed to him and he saw that it was one which he
had written in the autumn to a fellowstudent

No

Nor the person to whom it is addressed

Nor the person

Your memory is singularly short

It is a defect from which I have always suffered

Indeed And I heard the other day from a university professor that you
are considered by no means deficient rather clever in fact

You probably judge of cleverness by the policespy standard university
professors use words in a different sense

The note of rising irritation was plainly audible in Arthurs voice He
was physically exhausted with hunger foul air and want of sleep every
bone in his body seemed to ache separately and the colonels voice
grated on his exasperated nerves setting his teeth on edge like the
squeak of a slate pencil

Mr Burton said the colonel leaning back in his chair and speaking
gravely you are again forgetting yourself and I warn you once more
that this kind of talk will do you no good Surely you have had enough
of the dark cell not to want any more just for the present I tell you
plainly that I shall use strong measures with you if you persist in
repulsing gentle ones Mind I have proofpositive proofthat some
of these young men have been engaged in smuggling prohibited literature
into this port and that you have been in communication with them Now
are you going to tell me without compulsion what you know about this
affair

Arthur bent his head lower A blind senseless wildbeast fury was
beginning to stir within him like a live thing The possibility of
losing command over himself was more appalling to him than any threats
For the first time he began to realize what latent potentialities may
lie hidden beneath the culture of any gentleman and the piety of any
Christian and the terror of himself was strong upon him

I am waiting for your answer said the colonel

I have no answer to give

You positively refuse to answer

I will tell you nothing at all

Then I must simply order you back into the punishment cell and keep
you there till you change your mind If there is much more trouble with
you I shall put you in irons

Arthur looked up trembling from head to foot You will do as you
please he said slowly and whether the English Ambassador will stand
your playing tricks of that kind with a British subject who has not been
convicted of any crime is for him to decide

At last Arthur was conducted back to his own cell where he flung
himself down upon the bed and slept till the next morning He was not
put in irons and saw no more of the dreaded dark cell but the
feud between him and the colonel grew more inveterate with every
interrogation It was quite useless for Arthur to pray in his cell for
grace to conquer his evil passions or to meditate half the night long
upon the patience and meekness of Christ No sooner was he brought again
into the long bare room with its baizecovered table and confronted
with the colonels waxed moustache than the unchristian spirit would
take possession of him once more suggesting bitter repartees and
contemptuous answers Before he had been a month in the prison the
mutual irritation had reached such a height that he and the colonel
could not see each others faces without losing their temper

The continual strain of this petty warfare was beginning to tell heavily
upon his nerves Knowing how closely he was watched and remembering
certain dreadful rumours which he had heard of prisoners secretly
drugged with belladonna that notes might be taken of their ravings he
gradually became afraid to sleep or eat and if a mouse ran past him in
the night would start up drenched with cold sweat and quivering with
terror fancying that someone was hiding in the room to listen if he
talked in his sleep The gendarmes were evidently trying to entrap him
into making some admission which might compromise Bolla and so great
was his fear of slipping by any inadvertency into a pitfall that he
was really in danger of doing so through sheer nervousness Bollas name
rang in his ears night and day interfering even with his devotions and
forcing its way in among the beads of the rosary instead of the name of
Mary But the worst thing of all was that his religion like the outer
world seemed to be slipping away from him as the days went by To this
last foothold he clung with feverish tenacity spending several hours
of each day in prayer and meditation but his thoughts wandered more and
more often to Bolla and the prayers were growing terribly mechanical

His greatest comfort was the head warder of the prison This was a
little old man fat and bald who at first had tried his hardest to wear
a severe expression Gradually the good nature which peeped out of every
dimple in his chubby face conquered his official scruples and he began
carrying messages for the prisoners from cell to cell

One afternoon in the middle of May this warder came into the cell with a
face so scowling and gloomy that Arthur looked at him in astonishment

Why Enrico he exclaimed what on earth is wrong with you today

Nothing said Enrico snappishly and going up to the pallet he began
pulling off the rug which was Arthurs property

What do you want with my things Am I to be moved into another cell

No youre to be let out

Let out Whattoday For altogether Enrico

In his excitement Arthur had caught hold of the old mans arm It was
angrily wrenched away

Enrico What has come to you Why dont you answer Are we all going to
be let out

A contemptuous grunt was the only reply

Look here Arthur again took hold of the warders arm laughing
It is no use for you to be cross to me because Im not going to get
offended I want to know about the others

Which others growled Enrico suddenly laying down the shirt he was
folding Not Bolla I suppose

Bolla and all the rest of course Enrico what is the matter with
you

Well hes not likely to be let out in a hurry poor lad when a
comrade has betrayed him Ugh Enrico took up the shirt again in
disgust

Betrayed him A comrade Oh how dreadful Arthurs eyes dilated with
horror Enrico turned quickly round

Why wasnt it you

I Are you off your head man I

Well they told him so yesterday at interrogation anyhow Im very
glad if it wasnt you for I always thought you were rather a decent
young fellow This way Enrico stepped out into the corridor and Arthur
followed him a light breaking in upon the confusion of his mind

They told Bolla Id betrayed him Of course they did Why man they
told me he had betrayed me Surely Bolla isnt fool enough to believe
that sort of stuff

Then it really isnt true Enrico stopped at the foot of the stairs
and looked searchingly at Arthur who merely shrugged his shoulders

Of course its a lie

Well Im glad to hear it my lad and Ill tell him you said so But
you see what they told him was that you had denounced him out ofwell
out of jealousy because of your both being sweet on the same girl

Its a lie Arthur repeated the words in a quick breathless whisper
A sudden paralyzing fear had come over him The same girljealousy
How could they knowhow could they know

Wait a minute my lad Enrico stopped in the corridor leading to the
interrogation room and spoke softly I believe you but just tell me
one thing I know youre a Catholic did you ever say anything in the
confessional

Its a lie This time Arthurs voice had risen to a stifled cry

Enrico shrugged his shoulders and moved on again You know best of
course but you wouldnt be the only young fool thats been taken in
that way Theres a tremendous ado just now about a priest in Pisa that
some of your friends have found out Theyve printed a leaflet saying
hes a spy

He opened the door of the interrogation room and seeing that Arthur
stood motionless staring blankly before him pushed him gently across
the threshold

Goodafternoon Mr Burton said the colonel smiling and showing his
teeth amiably I have great pleasure in congratulating you An order
for your release has arrived from Florence Will you kindly sign this
paper

Arthur went up to him I want to know he said in a dull voice who
it was that betrayed me

The colonel raised his eyebrows with a smile

Cant you guess Think a minute

Arthur shook his head The colonel put out both hands with a gesture of
polite surprise

Cant guess Really Why you yourself Mr Burton Who else could know
your private love affairs

Arthur turned away in silence On the wall hung a large wooden crucifix
and his eyes wandered slowly to its face but with no appeal in them
only a dim wonder at this supine and patient God that had no thunderbolt
for a priest who betrayed the confessional

Will you kindly sign this receipt for your papers said the colonel
blandly and then I need not keep you any longer I am sure you must be
in a hurry to get home and my time is very much taken up just now with
the affairs of that foolish young man Bolla who tried your Christian
forbearance so hard I am afraid he will get a rather heavy sentence
Goodafternoon

Arthur signed the receipt took his papers and went out in dead
silence He followed Enrico to the massive gate and without a word of
farewell descended to the waters edge where a ferryman was waiting to
take him across the moat As he mounted the stone steps leading to
the street a girl in a cotton dress and straw hat ran up to him with
outstretched hands

Arthur Oh Im so gladIm so glad

He drew his hands away shivering

Jim he said at last in a voice that did not seem to belong to him
Jim

Ive been waiting here for half an hour They said you would come
out at four Arthur why do you look at me like that Something has
happened Arthur what has come to you Stop

He had turned away and was walking slowly down the street as if he
had forgotten her presence Thoroughly frightened at his manner she ran
after him and caught him by the arm

Arthur

He stopped and looked up with bewildered eyes She slipped her arm
through his and they walked on again for a moment in silence

Listen dear she began softly you mustnt get so upset over this
wretched business I know its dreadfully hard on you but everybody
understands

What business he asked in the same dull voice

I mean about Bollas letter

Arthurs face contracted painfully at the name

I thought you wouldnt have heard of it Gemma went on but I suppose
theyve told you Bolla must be perfectly mad to have imagined such a
thing

Such a thing

You dont know about it then He has written a horrible letter
saying that you have told about the steamers and got him arrested Its
perfectly absurd of course everyone that knows you sees that its
only the people who dont know you that have been upset by it Really
thats what I came here forto tell you that no one in our group
believes a word of it

Gemma But itsits true

She shrank slowly away from him and stood quite still her eyes wide
and dark with horror her face as white as the kerchief at her neck A
great icy wave of silence seemed to have swept round them both shutting
them out in a world apart from the life and movement of the street

Yes he whispered at last the steamersI spoke of that and I said
his nameoh my God my God What shall I do

He came to himself suddenly realizing her presence and the mortal
terror in her face Yes of course she must think

Gemma you dont understand he burst out moving nearer but she
recoiled with a sharp cry

Dont touch me

Arthur seized her right hand with sudden violence

Listen for Gods sake It was not my fault I

Let go let my hand go Let go

The next instant she wrenched her fingers away from his and struck him
across the cheek with her open hand

A kind of mist came over his eyes For a little while he was conscious
of nothing but Gemmas white and desperate face and the right hand
which she had fiercely rubbed on the skirt of her cotton dress Then
the daylight crept back again and he looked round and saw that he was
alone



CHAPTER VII

IT had long been dark when Arthur rang at the front door of the great
house in the Via Borra He remembered that he had been wandering about
the streets but where or why or for how long he had no idea Julias
page opened the door yawning and grinned significantly at the haggard
stony face It seemed to him a prodigious joke to have the young master
come home from jail like a drunk and disorderly beggar Arthur went
upstairs On the first floor he met Gibbons coming down with an air of
lofty and solemn disapproval He tried to pass with a muttered Good
evening but Gibbons was no easy person to get past against his will

The gentlemen are out sir he said looking critically at Arthurs
rather neglected dress and hair They have gone with the mistress to an
evening party and will not be back till nearly twelve

Arthur looked at his watch it was nine oclock Oh yes he would have
timeplenty of time

My mistress desired me to ask whether you would like any supper sir
and to say that she hopes you will sit up for her as she particularly
wishes to speak to you this evening

I dont want anything thank you you can tell her I have not gone to
bed

He went up to his room Nothing in it had been changed since his arrest
Montanellis portrait was on the table where he had placed it and
the crucifix stood in the alcove as before He paused a moment on the
threshold listening but the house was quite still evidently no one
was coming to disturb him He stepped softly into the room and locked
the door

And so he had come to the end There was nothing to think or trouble
about an importunate and useless consciousness to get rid ofand
nothing more It seemed a stupid aimless kind of thing somehow

He had not formed any resolve to commit suicide nor indeed had he
thought much about it the thing was quite obvious and inevitable He
had even no definite idea as to what manner of death to choose all that
mattered was to be done with it quicklyto have it over and forget He
had no weapon in the room not even a pocketknife but that was of no
consequencea towel would do or a sheet torn into strips

There was a large nail just over the window That would do but it must
be firm to bear his weight He got up on a chair to feel the nail it
was not quite firm and he stepped down again and took a hammer from a
drawer He knocked in the nail and was about to pull a sheet off his
bed when he suddenly remembered that he had not said his prayers Of
course one must pray before dying every Christian does that There are
even special prayers for a departing soul

He went into the alcove and knelt down before the crucifix Almighty
and merciful God he began aloud and with that broke off and said
no more Indeed the world was grown so dull that there was nothing left
to pray foror against And then what did Christ know about a trouble
of this kindChrist who had never suffered it He had only been
betrayed like Bolla He had never been tricked into betraying

Arthur rose crossing himself from old habit Approaching the table
he saw lying upon it a letter addressed to him in Montanellis
handwriting It was in pencil


My Dear Boy It is a great disappointment to me that I cannot see you
on the day of your release but I have been sent for to visit a dying
man I shall not get back till late at night Come to me early tomorrow
morning In great haste

L M


He put down the letter with a sigh it did seem hard on the Padre

How the people had laughed and gossiped in the streets Nothing was
altered since the days when he had been alive Not the least little one
of all the daily trifles round him was changed because a human soul a
living human soul had been struck down dead It was all just the same
as before The water had plashed in the fountains the sparrows had
twittered under the eaves just as they had done yesterday just as they
would do tomorrow And as for him he was deadquite dead

He sat down on the edge of the bed crossed his arms along the
footrail and rested his forehead upon them There was plenty of time
and his head ached sothe very middle of the brain seemed to ache it
was all so dull and stupidso utterly meaningless

 

The frontdoor bell rang sharply and he started up in a breathless
agony of terror with both hands at his throat They had come backhe
had sat there dreaming and let the precious time slip awayand now
he must see their faces and hear their cruel tonguestheir sneers and
commentsIf only he had a knife

He looked desperately round the room His mothers workbasket stood
in a little cupboard surely there would be scissors he might sever an
artery No the sheet and nail were safer if he had time

He dragged the counterpane from his bed and with frantic haste began
tearing off a strip The sound of footsteps came up the stairs No the
strip was too wide it would not tie firmly and there must be a noose
He worked faster as the footsteps drew nearer and the blood throbbed
in his temples and roared in his ears Quickerquicker Oh God five
minutes more

There was a knock at the door The strip of torn stuff dropped from his
hands and he sat quite still holding his breath to listen The handle
of the door was tried then Julias voice called

Arthur

He stood up panting

Arthur open the door please we are waiting

He gathered up the torn counterpane threw it into a drawer and hastily
smoothed down the bed

Arthur This time it was James who called and the doorhandle was
shaken impatiently Are you asleep

Arthur looked round the room saw that everything was hidden and
unlocked the door

I should think you might at least have obeyed my express request that
you should sit up for us Arthur said Julia sweeping into the room in
a towering passion You appear to think it the proper thing for us to
dance attendance for half an hour at your door

Four minutes my dear James mildly corrected stepping into the room
at the end of his wifes pink satin train I certainly think Arthur
that it would have been morebecoming if

What do you want Arthur interrupted He was standing with his hand
upon the door glancing furtively from one to the other like a trapped
animal But James was too obtuse and Julia too angry to notice the look

Mr Burton placed a chair for his wife and sat down carefully pulling
up his new trousers at the knees Julia and I he began feel it to
be our duty to speak to you seriously about

I cant listen tonight IIm not well My head achesyou must
wait

Arthur spoke in a strange indistinct voice with a confused and
rambling manner James looked round in surprise

Is there anything the matter with you he asked anxiously suddenly
remembering that Arthur had come from a very hotbed of infection I
hope youre not sickening for anything You look quite feverish

Nonsense Julia interrupted sharply Its only the usual theatricals
because hes ashamed to face us Come here and sit down Arthur Arthur
slowly crossed the room and sat down on the bed Yes he said wearily

Mr Burton coughed cleared his throat smoothed his already immaculate
beard and began the carefully prepared speech over again

I feel it to be my dutymy painful dutyto speak very seriously
to you about your extraordinary behaviour in connecting yourself
withalawbreakers and incendiaries andapersons of disreputable
character I believe you to have been perhaps more foolish than
depraveda

He paused

Yes Arthur said again

Now I do not wish to be hard on you James went on softening a
little in spite of himself before the weary hopelessness of Arthurs
manner I am quite willing to believe that you have been led away by
bad companions and to take into account your youth and inexperience and
theaaimprudent andaimpulsive character which you have I fear
inherited from your mother

Arthurs eyes wandered slowly to his mothers portrait and back again
but he did not speak

But you will I feel sure understand James continued that it is
quite impossible for me to keep any longer in my house a person who has
brought public disgrace upon a name so highly respected as ours

Yes Arthur repeated once more

Well said Julia sharply closing her fan with a snap and laying it
across her knee Are you going to have the goodness to say anything but
Yes Arthur

You will do as you think best of course he answered slowly without
moving It doesnt matter much either way

Doesntmatter James repeated aghast and his wife rose with a
laugh

Oh it doesnt matter doesnt it Well James I hope you understand
now how much gratitude you may expect in that quarter I told you what
would come of showing charity to Papist adventuresses and their

Hush hush Never mind that my dear

Its all nonsense James weve had more than enough of this
sentimentality A lovechild setting himself up as a member of the
familyits quite time he did know what his mother was Why should
we be saddled with the child of a Popish priests amourettes There
thenlook

She pulled a crumpled sheet of paper out of her pocket and tossed
it across the table to Arthur He opened it the writing was in his
mothers hand and was dated four months before his birth It was a
confession addressed to her husband and with two signatures

Arthurs eyes travelled slowly down the page past the unsteady letters
in which her name was written to the strong familiar signature
Lorenzo Montanelli For a moment he stared at the writing then
without a word refolded the paper and laid it down James rose and took
his wife by the arm

There Julia that will do Just go downstairs now its late and I
want to talk a little business with Arthur It wont interest you

She glanced up at her husband then back at Arthur who was silently
staring at the floor

He seems half stupid she whispered

When she had gathered up her train and left the room James carefully
shut the door and went back to his chair beside the table Arthur sat as
before perfectly motionless and silent

Arthur James began in a milder tone now Julia was not there to hear
I am very sorry that this has come out You might just as well not have
known it However all thats over and I am pleased to see that you
can behave with such selfcontrol Julia is aa little excited ladies
oftenanyhow I dont want to be too hard on you

He stopped to see what effect the kindly words had produced but Arthur
was quite motionless

Of course my dear boy James went on after a moment this is a
distressing story altogether and the best thing we can do is to hold
our tongues about it My father was generous enough not to divorce your
mother when she confessed her fall to him he only demanded that the
man who had led her astray should leave the country at once and as
you know he went to China as a missionary For my part I was very much
against your having anything to do with him when he came back but my
father just at the last consented to let him teach you on condition
that he never attempted to see your mother I must in justice
acknowledge that I believe they both observed that condition faithfully
to the end It is a very deplorable business but

Arthur looked up All the life and expression had gone out of his face
it was like a waxen mask

Ddont you think he said softly with a curious stammering
hesitation on the words ththatall thisisvveryfunny

FUNNY James pushed his chair away from the table and sat staring at
him too much petrified for anger Funny Arthur are you mad

Arthur suddenly threw back his head and burst into a frantic fit of
laughing

Arthur exclaimed the shipowner rising with dignity I am amazed at
your levity

There was no answer but peal after peal of laughter so loud and
boisterous that even James began to doubt whether there was not
something more the matter here than levity

Just like a hysterical woman he muttered turning with a
contemptuous shrug of his shoulders to tramp impatiently up and
down the room Really Arthur youre worse than Julia there stop
laughing I cant wait about here all night

He might as well have asked the crucifix to come down from its pedestal
Arthur was past caring for remonstrances or exhortations he only
laughed and laughed and laughed without end

This is absurd said James stopping at last in his irritated pacing
to and fro You are evidently too much excited to be reasonable
tonight I cant talk business with you if youre going on that way
Come to me tomorrow morning after breakfast And now you had better go
to bed Goodnight

He went out slamming the door Now for the hysterics downstairs he
muttered as he tramped noisily away I suppose itll be tears there

 

The frenzied laughter died on Arthurs lips He snatched up the hammer
from the table and flung himself upon the crucifix

With the crash that followed he came suddenly to his senses standing
before the empty pedestal the hammer still in his hand and the
fragments of the broken image scattered on the floor about his feet

He threw down the hammer So easy he said and turned away And what
an idiot I am

He sat down by the table panting heavily for breath and rested his
forehead on both hands Presently he rose and going to the washstand
poured a jugful of cold water over his head and face He came back quite
composed and sat down to think

And it was for such things as thesefor these false and slavish people
these dumb and soulless godsthat he had suffered all these tortures
of shame and passion and despair had made a rope to hang himself
forsooth because one priest was a liar As if they were not all liars
Well all that was done with he was wiser now He need only shake off
these vermin and begin life afresh

There were plenty of goods vessels in the docks it would be an easy
matter to stow himself away in one of them and get across to Canada
Australia Cape Colonyanywhere It was no matter for the country if
only it was far enough and as for the life out there he could see
and if it did not suit him he could try some other place

He took out his purse Only thirtythree paoli but his watch was a
good one That would help him along a bit and in any case it was of no
consequencehe should pull through somehow But they would search
for him all these people they would be sure to make inquiries at the
docks No he must put them on a false scentmake them believe him
dead then he should be quite freequite free He laughed softly to
himself at the thought of the Burtons searching for his corpse What a
farce the whole thing was

Taking a sheet of paper he wrote the first words that occurred to him


I believed in you as I believed in God God is a thing made of clay
that I can smash with a hammer and you have fooled me with a lie


He folded up the paper directed it to Montanelli and taking another
sheet wrote across it Look for my body in Darsena Then he put on
his hat and went out of the room Passing his mothers portrait he
looked up with a laugh and a shrug of his shoulders She too had lied
to him

He crept softly along the corridor and slipping back the doorbolts
went out on to the great dark echoing marble staircase It seemed to
yawn beneath him like a black pit as he descended

He crossed the courtyard treading cautiously for fear of waking Gian
Battista who slept on the ground floor In the woodcellar at the back
was a little grated window opening on the canal and not more than four
feet from the ground He remembered that the rusty grating had broken
away on one side by pushing a little he could make an aperture wide
enough to climb out by

The grating was strong and he grazed his hands badly and tore the
sleeve of his coat but that was no matter He looked up and down the
street there was no one in sight and the canal lay black and silent
an ugly trench between two straight and slimy walls The untried
universe might prove a dismal hole but it could hardly be more flat
and sordid than the corner which he was leaving behind him There was
nothing to regret nothing to look back upon It had been a pestilent
little stagnant world full of squalid lies and clumsy cheats and
foulsmelling ditches that were not even deep enough to drown a man

He walked along the canal bank and came out upon the tiny square by the
Medici palace It was here that Gemma had run up to him with her vivid
face her outstretched hands Here was the little flight of wet stone
steps leading down to the moat and there the fortress scowling across
the strip of dirty water He had never noticed before how squat and mean
it looked

Passing through the narrow streets he reached the Darsena
shippingbasin where he took off his hat and flung it into the water
It would be found of course when they dragged for his body Then he
walked on along the waters edge considering perplexedly what to do
next He must contrive to hide on some ship but it was a difficult
thing to do His only chance would be to get on to the huge old
Medici breakwater and walk along to the further end of it There was a
lowclass tavern on the point probably he should find some sailor there
who could be bribed

But the dock gates were closed How should he get past them and past
the customs officials His stock of money would not furnish the high
bribe that they would demand for letting him through at night and
without a passport Besides they might recognize him

As he passed the bronze statue of the Four Moors a mans figure
emerged from an old house on the opposite side of the shipping basin
and approached the bridge Arthur slipped at once into the deep shadow
behind the group of statuary and crouched down in the darkness peeping
cautiously round the corner of the pedestal

It was a soft spring night warm and starlit The water lapped against
the stone walls of the basin and swirled in gentle eddies round the
steps with a sound as of low laughter Somewhere near a chain creaked
swinging slowly to and fro A huge iron crane towered up tall and
melancholy in the dimness Black on a shimmering expanse of starry sky
and pearly cloudwreaths the figures of the fettered struggling slaves
stood out in vain and vehement protest against a merciless doom

The man approached unsteadily along the water side shouting an English
street song He was evidently a sailor returning from a carouse at some
tavern No one else was within sight As he drew near Arthur stood up
and stepped into the middle of the roadway The sailor broke off in his
song with an oath and stopped short

I want to speak to you Arthur said in Italian Do you understand
me

The man shook his head Its no use talking that patter to me he
said then plunging into bad French asked sullenly What do you want
Why cant you let me pass

Just come out of the light here a minute I want to speak to you

Ah wouldnt you like it Out of the light Got a knife anywhere about
you

No no man Cant you see I only want your help Ill pay you for it

Eh What And dressed like a swell too The sailor had relapsed
into English He now moved into the shadow and leaned against the
railing of the pedestal

Well he said returning to his atrocious French and what is it you
want

I want to get away from here

Aha Stowaway Want me to hide you Been up to something I suppose
Stuck a knife into somebody eh Just like these foreigners And where
might you be wanting to go Not to the police station I fancy

He laughed in his tipsy way and winked one eye

What vessel do you belong to

CarlottaLeghorn to Buenos Ayres shipping oil one way and hides
the other Shes over therepointing in the direction of the
breakwaterbeastly old hulk

Buenos Ayresyes Can you hide me anywhere on board

How much can you give

Not very much I have only a few paoli

No Cant do it under fiftyand cheap at that tooa swell like you

What do you mean by a swell If you like my clothes you may change with
me but I cant give you more money than I have got

You have a watch there Hand it over

Arthur took out a ladys gold watch delicately chased and enamelled
with the initials G B on the back It had been his mothersbut
what did that matter now

Ah remarked the sailor with a quick glance at it Stolen of course
Let me look

Arthur drew his hand away No he said I will give you the watch
when we are on board not before

Youre not such a fool as you look after all Ill bet its your first
scrape though eh

That is my business Ah there comes the watchman

They crouched down behind the group of statuary and waited till the
watchman had passed Then the sailor rose and telling Arthur to
follow him walked on laughing foolishly to himself Arthur followed in
silence

The sailor led him back to the little irregular square by the Medici
palace and stopping in a dark corner mumbled in what was intended for
a cautious whisper

Wait here those soldier fellows will see you if you come further

What are you going to do

Get you some clothes Im not going to take you on board with that
bloody coatsleeve

Arthur glanced down at the sleeve which had been torn by the window
grating A little blood from the grazed hand had fallen upon it
Evidently the man thought him a murderer Well it was of no consequence
what people thought

After some time the sailor came back triumphant with a bundle under
his arm

Change he whispered and make haste about it I must get back and
that old Jew has kept me bargaining and haggling for half an hour

Arthur obeyed shrinking with instinctive disgust at the first touch of
secondhand clothes Fortunately these though rough and coarse were
fairly clean When he stepped into the light in his new attire the
sailor looked at him with tipsy solemnity and gravely nodded his
approval

Youll do he said This way and dont make a noise Arthur
carrying his discarded clothes followed him through a labyrinth of
winding canals and dark narrow alleys the mediaeval slum quarter which
the people of Leghorn call New Venice Here and there a gloomy old
palace solitary among the squalid houses and filthy courts stood
between two noisome ditches with a forlorn air of trying to preserve
its ancient dignity and yet of knowing the effort to be a hopeless
one Some of the alleys he knew were notorious dens of thieves
cutthroats and smugglers others were merely wretched and
povertystricken

Beside one of the little bridges the sailor stopped and looking round
to see that they were not observed descended a flight of stone steps
to a narrow landing stage Under the bridge was a dirty crazy old boat
Sharply ordering Arthur to jump in and lie down he seated himself in
the boat and began rowing towards the harbours mouth Arthur lay still
on the wet and leaky planks hidden by the clothes which the man had
thrown over him and peeping out from under them at the familiar streets
and houses

Presently they passed under a bridge and entered that part of the canal
which forms a moat for the fortress The massive walls rose out of the
water broad at the base and narrowing upward to the frowning turrets
How strong how threatening they had seemed to him a few hours ago And
now

He laughed softly as he lay in the bottom of the boat

Hold your noise the sailor whispered and keep your head covered
Were close to the custom house

Arthur drew the clothes over his head A few yards further on the boat
stopped before a row of masts chained together which lay across the
surface of the canal blocking the narrow waterway between the custom
house and the fortress wall A sleepy official came out yawning and bent
over the waters edge with a lantern in his hand

Passports please

The sailor handed up his official papers Arthur half stifled under the
clothes held his breath listening

A nice time of night to come back to your ship grumbled the customs
official Been out on the spree I suppose Whats in your boat

Old clothes Got them cheap He held up the waistcoat for inspection
The official lowering his lantern bent over straining his eyes to
see

Its all right I suppose You can pass

He lifted the barrier and the boat moved slowly out into the dark
heaving water At a little distance Arthur sat up and threw off the
clothes

Here she is the sailor whispered after rowing for some time in
silence Keep close behind me and hold your tongue

He clambered up the side of a huge black monster swearing under his
breath at the clumsiness of the landsman though Arthurs natural
agility rendered him less awkward than most people would have been in
his place Once safely on board they crept cautiously between dark
masses of rigging and machinery and came at last to a hatchway which
the sailor softly raised

Down here he whispered Ill be back in a minute

The hold was not only damp and dark but intolerably foul At first
Arthur instinctively drew back half choked by the stench of raw hides
and rancid oil Then he remembered the punishment cell and descended
the ladder shrugging his shoulders Life is pretty much the same
everywhere it seemed ugly putrid infested with vermin full of
shameful secrets and dark corners Still life is life and he must make
the best of it

In a few minutes the sailor came back with something in his hands which
Arthur could not distinctly see for the darkness

Now give me the watch and money Make haste

Taking advantage of the darkness Arthur succeeded in keeping back a few
coins

You must get me something to eat he said I am half starved

Ive brought it Here you are The sailor handed him a pitcher some
hard biscuit and a piece of salt pork Now mind you must hide in this
empty barrel here when the customs officers come to examine tomorrow
morning Keep as still as a mouse till were right out at sea Ill let
you know when to come out And wont you just catch it when the captain
sees youthats all Got the drink safe Goodnight

The hatchway closed and Arthur setting the precious drink in a safe
place climbed on to an oil barrel to eat his pork and biscuit Then he
curled himself up on the dirty floor and for the first time since his
babyhood settled himself to sleep without a prayer The rats scurried
round him in the darkness but neither their persistent noise nor the
swaying of the ship nor the nauseating stench of oil nor the prospect
of tomorrows seasickness could keep him awake He cared no more for
them all than for the broken and dishonoured idols that only yesterday
had been the gods of his adoration





PART II


THIRTEEN YEARS LATER



CHAPTER I

ONE evening in July 1846 a few acquaintances met at Professor
Fabrizis house in Florence to discuss plans for future political work

Several of them belonged to the Mazzinian party and would have been
satisfied with nothing less than a democratic Republic and a United
Italy Others were Constitutional Monarchists and Liberals of
various shades On one point however they were all agreed that of
dissatisfaction with the Tuscan censorship and the popular professor
had called the meeting in the hope that on this one subject at least
the representatives of the dissentient parties would be able to get
through an hours discussion without quarrelling

Only a fortnight had elapsed since the famous amnesty which Pius IX had
granted on his accession to political offenders in the Papal States
but the wave of liberal enthusiasm caused by it was already spreading
over Italy In Tuscany even the government appeared to have been
affected by the astounding event It had occurred to Fabrizi and a few
other leading Florentines that this was a propitious moment for a bold
effort to reform the presslaws

Of course the dramatist Lega had said when the subject was first
broached to him it would be impossible to start a newspaper till we
can get the presslaw changed we should not bring out the first number
But we may be able to run some pamphlets through the censorship already
and the sooner we begin the sooner we shall get the law changed

He was now explaining in Fabrizis library his theory of the line which
should be taken by liberal writers at the moment

There is no doubt interposed one of the company a grayhaired
barrister with a rather drawling manner of speech that in some way we
must take advantage of the moment We shall not see such a favourable
one again for bringing forward serious reforms But I doubt the
pamphlets doing any good They will only irritate and frighten the
government instead of winning it over to our side which is what we
really want to do If once the authorities begin to think of us as
dangerous agitators our chance of getting their help is gone

Then what would you have us do

Petition

To the Grand Duke

Yes for an augmentation of the liberty of the press

A keenlooking dark man sitting by the window turned his head round
with a laugh

Youll get a lot out of petitioning he said I should have thought
the result of the Renzi case was enough to cure anybody of going to work
that way

My dear sir I am as much grieved as you are that we did not succeed in
preventing the extradition of Renzi But reallyI do not wish to hurt
the sensibilities of anyone but I cannot help thinking that our failure
in that case was largely due to the impatience and vehemence of some
persons among our number I should certainly hesitate

As every Piedmontese always does the dark man interrupted sharply I
dont know where the vehemence and impatience lay unless you found them
in the strings of meek petitions we sent in That may be vehemence for
Tuscany or Piedmont but we should not call it particularly vehement in
Naples

Fortunately remarked the Piedmontese Neapolitan vehemence is
peculiar to Naples

There there gentlemen that will do the professor put in
Neapolitan customs are very good things in their way and Piedmontese
customs in theirs but just now we are in Tuscany and the Tuscan custom
is to stick to the matter in hand Grassini votes for petitions and
Galli against them What do you think Dr Riccardo

I see no harm in petitions and if Grassini gets one up Ill sign it
with all the pleasure in life But I dont think mere petitioning and
nothing else will accomplish much Why cant we have both petitions and
pamphlets

Simply because the pamphlets will put the government into a state of
mind in which it wont grant the petitions said Grassini

It wont do that anyhow The Neapolitan rose and came across to the
table Gentlemen youre on the wrong tack Conciliating the government
will do no good What we must do is to rouse the people

Thats easier said than done how are you going to start

Fancy asking Galli that Of course hed start by knocking the censor on
the head

No indeed I shouldnt said Galli stoutly You always think if
a man comes from down south he must believe in no argument but cold
steel

Well what do you propose then Sh Attention gentlemen Galli has a
proposal to make

The whole company which had broken up into little knots of twos and
threes carrying on separate discussions collected round the table to
listen Galli raised his hands in expostulation

No gentlemen it is not a proposal it is merely a suggestion
It appears to me that there is a great practical danger in all this
rejoicing over the new Pope People seem to think that because he has
struck out a new line and granted this amnesty we have only to throw
ourselvesall of us the whole of Italyinto his arms and he will
carry us to the promised land Now I am second to no one in admiration
of the Popes behaviour the amnesty was a splendid action

I am sure His Holiness ought to feel flattered Grassini began
contemptuously

There Grassini do let the man speak Riccardo interrupted in his
turn Its a most extraordinary thing that you two never can keep from
sparring like a cat and dog Get on Galli

What I wanted to say is this continued the Neapolitan The Holy
Father undoubtedly is acting with the best intentions but how far he
will succeed in carrying his reforms is another question Just now its
smooth enough and of course the reactionists all over Italy will lie
quiet for a month or two till the excitement about the amnesty blows
over but they are not likely to let the power be taken out of their
hands without a fight and my own belief is that before the winter is
half over we shall have Jesuits and Gregorians and Sanfedists and
all the rest of the crew about our ears plotting and intriguing and
poisoning off everybody they cant bribe

Thats likely enough

Very well then shall we wait here meekly sending in petitions till
Lambruschini and his pack have persuaded the Grand Duke to put us bodily
under Jesuit rule with perhaps a few Austrian hussars to patrol the
streets and keep us in order or shall we forestall them and take
advantage of their momentary discomfiture to strike the first blow

Tell us first what blow you propose

I would suggest that we start an organized propaganda and agitation
against the Jesuits

A pamphleteering declaration of war in fact

Yes exposing their intrigues ferreting out their secrets and calling
upon the people to make common cause against them

But there are no Jesuits here to expose

Arent there Wait three months and see how many we shall have Itll
be too late to keep them out then

But really to rouse the town against the Jesuits one must speak
plainly and if you do that how will you evade the censorship

I wouldnt evade it I would defy it

You would print the pamphlets anonymously Thats all very well
but the fact is we have all seen enough of the clandestine press to
know

I did not mean that I would print the pamphlets openly with our names
and addresses and let them prosecute us if they dare

The project is a perfectly mad one Grassini exclaimed It is simply
putting ones head into the lions mouth out of sheer wantonness

Oh you neednt be afraid Galli cut in sharply we shouldnt ask you
to go to prison for our pamphlets

Hold your tongue Galli said Riccardo Its not a question of being
afraid were all as ready as you are to go to prison if theres any
good to be got by it but it is childish to run into danger for nothing
For my part I have an amendment to the proposal to suggest

Well what is it

I think we might contrive with care to fight the Jesuits without
coming into collision with the censorship

I dont see how you are going to manage it

I think that it is possible to clothe what one has to say in so
roundabout a form that

That the censorship wont understand it And then youll expect every
poor artisan and labourer to find out the meaning by the light of
the ignorance and stupidity that are in him That doesnt sound very
practicable

Martini what do you think asked the professor turning to a
broadshouldered man with a great brown beard who was sitting beside
him

I think that I will reserve my opinion till I have more facts to go
upon Its a question of trying experiments and seeing what comes of
them

And you Sacconi

I should like to hear what Signora Bolla has to say Her suggestions
are always valuable

Everyone turned to the only woman in the room who had been sitting on
the sofa resting her chin on one hand and listening in silence to the
discussion She had deep serious black eyes but as she raised them now
there was an unmistakable gleam of amusement in them

I am afraid she said that I disagree with everybody

You always do and the worst of it is that you are always right
Riccardo put in

I think it is quite true that we must fight the Jesuits somehow and if
we cant do it with one weapon we must with another But mere defiance
is a feeble weapon and evasion a cumbersome one As for petitioning
that is a childs toy

I hope signora Grassini interposed with a solemn face that you
are not suggesting such methods asassassination

Martini tugged at his big moustache and Galli sniggered outright Even
the grave young woman could not repress a smile

Believe me she said that if I were ferocious enough to think of
such things I should not be childish enough to talk about them But
the deadliest weapon I know is ridicule If you can once succeed in
rendering the Jesuits ludicrous in making people laugh at them and
their claims you have conquered them without bloodshed

I believe you are right as far as that goes Fabrizi said but I
dont see how you are going to carry the thing through

Why should we not be able to carry it through asked Martini A
satirical thing has a better chance of getting over the censorship
difficulty than a serious one and if it must be cloaked the average
reader is more likely to find out the double meaning of an apparently
silly joke than of a scientific or economic treatise

Then is your suggestion signora that we should issue satirical
pamphlets or attempt to run a comic paper That last I am sure the
censorship would never allow

I dont mean exactly either I believe a series of small satirical
leaflets in verse or prose to be sold cheap or distributed free about
the streets would be very useful If we could find a clever artist
who would enter into the spirit of the thing we might have them
illustrated

Its a capital idea if only one could carry it out but if the thing
is to be done at all it must be well done We should want a firstclass
satirist and where are we to get him

You see added Lega most of us are serious writers and with
all respect to the company I am afraid that a general attempt to be
humorous would present the spectacle of an elephant trying to dance the
tarantella

I never suggested that we should all rush into work for which we
are unfitted My idea was that we should try to find a really gifted
satiristthere must be one to be got somewhere in Italy surelyand
offer to provide the necessary funds Of course we should have to know
something of the man and make sure that he would work on lines with
which we could agree

But where are you going to find him I can count up the satirists
of any real talent on the fingers of one hand and none of them are
available Giusti wouldnt accept he is fully occupied as it is There
are one or two good men in Lombardy but they write only in the Milanese
dialect

And moreover said Grassini the Tuscan people can be influenced in
better ways than this I am sure that it would be felt as to say the
least a want of political savoir faire if we were to treat this solemn
question of civil and religious liberty as a subject for trifling
Florence is not a mere wilderness of factories and moneygetting like
London nor a haunt of idle luxury like Paris It is a city with a great
history

So was Athens she interrupted smiling but it was rather sluggish
from its size and needed a gadfly to rouse it

Riccardo struck his hand upon the table Why we never thought of the
Gadfly The very man

Who is that

The GadflyFelice Rivarez Dont you remember him One of Muratoris
band that came down from the Apennines three years ago

Oh you knew that set didnt you I remember your travelling with them
when they went on to Paris

Yes I went as far as Leghorn to see Rivarez off for Marseilles He
wouldnt stop in Tuscany he said there was nothing left to do but
laugh once the insurrection had failed and so he had better go to
Paris No doubt he agreed with Signor Grassini that Tuscany is the wrong
place to laugh in But I am nearly sure he would come back if we asked
him now that there is a chance of doing something in Italy

What name did you say

Rivarez Hes a Brazilian I think At any rate I know he has lived
out there He is one of the wittiest men I ever came across Heaven
knows we had nothing to be merry over that week in Leghorn it was
enough to break ones heart to look at poor Lambertini but there was
no keeping ones countenance when Rivarez was in the room it was one
perpetual fire of absurdities He had a nasty sabrecut across the face
too I remember sewing it up Hes an odd creature but I believe he
and his nonsense kept some of those poor lads from breaking down
altogether

Is that the man who writes political skits in the French papers under
the name of Le Taon

Yes short paragraphs mostly and comic feuilletons The smugglers up
in the Apennines called him the Gadfly because of his tongue and he
took the nickname to sign his work with

I know something about this gentleman said Grassini breaking in upon
the conversation in his slow and stately manner and I cannot say that
what I have heard is much to his credit He undoubtedly possesses a
certain showy superficial cleverness though I think his abilities have
been exaggerated and possibly he is not lacking in physical courage
but his reputation in Paris and Vienna is I believe very far from
spotless He appears to be a gentleman ofaamany adventures and
unknown antecedents It is said that he was picked up out of charity by
Duprezs expedition somewhere in the wilds of tropical South America
in a state of inconceivable savagery and degradation I believe he has
never satisfactorily explained how he came to be in such a condition As
for the rising in the Apennines I fear it is no secret that persons of
all characters took part in that unfortunate affair The men who were
executed in Bologna are known to have been nothing but common
malefactors and the character of many who escaped will hardly bear
description Without doubt SOME of the participators were men of high
character

Some of them were the intimate friends of several persons in this
room Riccardo interrupted with an angry ring in his voice Its all
very well to be particular and exclusive Grassini but these common
malefactors died for their belief which is more than you or I have
done as yet

And another time when people tell you the stale gossip of Paris
added Galli you can tell them from me that they are mistaken about
the Duprez expedition I know Duprezs adjutant Martel personally and
have heard the whole story from him Its true that they found Rivarez
stranded out there He had been taken prisoner in the war fighting
for the Argentine Republic and had escaped He was wandering about the
country in various disguises trying to get back to Buenos Ayres But
the story of their taking him on out of charity is a pure fabrication
Their interpreter had fallen ill and been obliged to turn back and not
one of the Frenchmen could speak the native languages so they offered
him the post and he spent the whole three years with them exploring
the tributaries of the Amazon Martel told me he believed they never
would have got through the expedition at all if it had not been for
Rivarez

Whatever he may be said Fabrizi there must be something remarkable
about a man who could lay his come hither on two old campaigners like
Martel and Duprez as he seems to have done What do you think signora

I know nothing about the matter I was in England when the fugitives
passed through Tuscany But I should think that if the companions who
were with a man on a three years expedition in savage countries and
the comrades who were with him through an insurrection think well of
him that is recommendation enough to counterbalance a good deal of
boulevard gossip

There is no question about the opinion his comrades had of him
said Riccardo From Muratori and Zambeccari down to the roughest
mountaineers they were all devoted to him Moreover he is a personal
friend of Orsini Its quite true on the other hand that there are
endless cockandbull stories of a not very pleasant kind going about
concerning him in Paris but if a man doesnt want to make enemies he
shouldnt become a political satirist

Im not quite sure interposed Lega but it seems to me that I
saw him once when the refugees were here Was he not hunchbacked or
crooked or something of that kind

The professor had opened a drawer in his writingtable and was turning
over a heap of papers I think I have his police description somewhere
here he said You remember when they escaped and hid in the mountain
passes their personal appearance was posted up everywhere and that
Cardinalwhats the scoundrels nameSpinola offered a reward for
their heads

There was a splendid story about Rivarez and that police paper by the
way He put on a soldiers old uniform and tramped across country as a
carabineer wounded in the discharge of his duty and trying to find his
company He actually got Spinolas searchparty to give him a lift
and rode the whole day in one of their waggons telling them harrowing
stories of how he had been taken captive by the rebels and dragged off
into their haunts in the mountains and of the fearful tortures that he
had suffered at their hands They showed him the description paper and
he told them all the rubbish he could think of about the fiend they
call the Gadfly Then at night when they were asleep he poured a
bucketful of water into their powder and decamped with his pockets full
of provisions and ammunition

Ah heres the paper Fabrizi broke in Felice Rivarez called The
Gadfly Age about 30 birthplace and parentage unknown probably South
American profession journalist Short black hair black beard dark
skin eyes blue forehead broad and square nose mouth chin
Yes here it is Special marks right foot lame left arm twisted two
ringers missing on left hand recent sabrecut across face stammers
Then theres a note put Very expert shot care should be taken in
arresting

Its an extraordinary thing that he can have managed to deceive the
searchparty with such a formidable list of identification marks

It was nothing but sheer audacity that carried him through of course
If it had once occurred to them to suspect him he would have been lost
But the air of confiding innocence that he can put on when he chooses
would bring a man through anything Well gentlemen what do you think
of the proposal Rivarez seems to be pretty well known to several of the
company Shall we suggest to him that we should be glad of his help here
or not

I think said Fabrizi that he might be sounded upon the subject
just to find out whether he would be inclined to think of the plan

Oh hell be inclined you may be sure once its a case of fighting
the Jesuits he is the most savage anticlerical I ever met in fact
hes rather rabid on the point

Then will you write Riccardo

Certainly Let me see where is he now In Switzerland I think Hes
the most restless being always flitting about But as for the pamphlet
question

They plunged into a long and animated discussion When at last the
company began to disperse Martini went up to the quiet young woman

I will see you home Gemma

Thanks I want to have a business talk with you

Anything wrong with the addresses he asked softly

Nothing serious but I think it is time to make a few alterations Two
letters have been stopped in the post this week They were both quite
unimportant and it may have been accidental but we cannot afford to
have any risks If once the police have begun to suspect any of our
addresses they must be changed immediately

I will come in about that tomorrow I am not going to talk business
with you tonight you look tired

I am not tired

Then you are depressed again

Oh no not particularly



CHAPTER II


Is the mistress in Katie

Yes sir she is dressing If youll just step into the parlour she
will be down in a few minutes

Katie ushered the visitor in with the cheerful friendliness of a true
Devonshire girl Martini was a special favourite of hers He spoke
English like a foreigner of course but still quite respectably and
he never sat discussing politics at the top of his voice till one in
the morning when the mistress was tired as some visitors had a way of
doing Moreover he had come to Devonshire to help the mistress in her
trouble when her baby was dead and her husband dying there and ever
since that time the big awkward silent man had been to Katie as much
one of the family as was the lazy black cat which now ensconced itself
upon his knee Pasht for his part regarded Martini as a useful piece
of household furniture This visitor never trod upon his tail or
puffed tobacco smoke into his eyes or in any way obtruded upon his
consciousness an aggressive biped personality He behaved as a mere man
should provided a comfortable knee to lie upon and purr and at
table never forgot that to look on while human beings eat fish is not
interesting for a cat The friendship between them was of old date
Once when Pasht was a kitten and his mistress too ill to think about
him he had come from England under Martinis care tucked away in a
basket Since then long experience had convinced him that this clumsy
human bear was no fairweather friend

How snug you look you two said Gemma coming into the room One
would think you had settled yourselves for the evening

Martini carefully lifted the cat off his knee I came early he said
in the hope that you will give me some tea before we start There will
probably be a frightful crush and Grassini wont give us any sensible
supperthey never do in those fashionable houses

Come now she said laughing thats as bad as Galli Poor Grassini
has quite enough sins of his own to answer for without having his wifes
imperfect housekeeping visited upon his head As for the tea it will be
ready in a minute Katie has been making some Devonshire cakes specially
for you

Katie is a good soul isnt she Pasht By the way so are you to have
put on that pretty dress I was afraid you would forget

I promised you I would wear it though it is rather warm for a hot
evening like this

It will be much cooler up at Fiesole and nothing else ever suits you
so well as white cashmere I have brought you some flowers to wear with
it

Oh those lovely cluster roses I am so fond of them But they had much
better go into water I hate to wear flowers

Now thats one of your superstitious fancies

No it isnt only I think they must get so bored spending all the
evening pinned to such a dull companion

I am afraid we shall all be bored tonight The conversazione will be
dull beyond endurance

Why

Partly because everything Grassini touches becomes as dull as himself

Now dont be spiteful It is not fair when we are going to be a mans
guests

You are always right Madonna Well then it will be dull because half
the interesting people are not coming

How is that

I dont know Out of town or ill or something Anyway there will
be two or three ambassadors and some learned Germans and the usual
nondescript crowd of tourists and Russian princes and literary club
people and a few French officers nobody else that I know ofexcept
of course the new satirist who is to be the attraction of the
evening

The new satirist What Rivarez But I thought Grassini disapproved of
him so strongly

Yes but once the man is here and is sure to be talked about of course
Grassini wants his house to be the first place where the new lion will
be on show You may be sure Rivarez has heard nothing of Grassinis
disapproval He may have guessed it though hes sharp enough

I did not even know he had come

He only arrived yesterday Here comes the tea No dont get up let me
fetch the kettle

He was never so happy as in this little study Gemmas friendship her
grave unconsciousness of the charm she exercised over him her frank and
simple comradeship were the brightest things for him in a life that
was none too bright and whenever he began to feel more than usually
depressed he would come in here after business hours and sit with her
generally in silence watching her as she bent over her needlework or
poured out tea She never questioned him about his troubles or expressed
any sympathy in words but he always went away stronger and calmer
feeling as he put it to himself that he could trudge through another
fortnight quite respectably She possessed without knowing it the
rare gift of consolation and when two years ago his dearest friends
had been betrayed in Calabria and shot down like wolves her steady
faith had been perhaps the thing which had saved him from despair

On Sunday mornings he sometimes came in to talk business that
expression standing for anything connected with the practical work of
the Mazzinian party of which they both were active and devoted members
She was quite a different creature then keen cool and logical
perfectly accurate and perfectly neutral Those who saw her only at her
political work regarded her as a trained and disciplined conspirator
trustworthy courageous in every way a valuable member of the
party but somehow lacking in life and individuality Shes a born
conspirator worth any dozen of us and she is nothing more Galli had
said of her The Madonna Gemma whom Martini knew was very difficult to
get at

Well and what is your new satirist like she asked glancing back
over her shoulder as she opened the sideboard There Cesare there
are barleysugar and candied angelica for you I wonder by the way why
revolutionary men are always so fond of sweets

Other men are too only they think it beneath their dignity to confess
it The new satirist Oh the kind of man that ordinary women will
rave over and you will dislike A sort of professional dealer in sharp
speeches that goes about the world with a lackadaisical manner and a
handsome balletgirl dangling on to his coattails

Do you mean that there is really a balletgirl or simply that you feel
cross and want to imitate the sharp speeches

The Lord defend me No the balletgirl is real enough and handsome
enough too for those who like shrewish beauty Personally I dont
Shes a Hungarian gipsy or something of that kind so Riccardo says
from some provincial theatre in Galicia He seems to be rather a cool
hand he has been introducing the girl to people just as if she were his
maiden aunt

Well thats only fair if he has taken her away from her home

You may look at things that way dear Madonna but society wont I
think most people will very much resent being introduced to a woman whom
they know to be his mistress

How can they know it unless he tells them so

Its plain enough youll see if you meet her But I should think even
he would not have the audacity to bring her to the Grassinis

They wouldnt receive her Signora Grassini is not the woman to do
unconventional things of that kind But I wanted to hear about Signor
Rivarez as a satirist not as a man Fabrizi told me he had been written
to and had consented to come and take up the campaign against the
Jesuits and that is the last I have heard There has been such a rush
of work this week

I dont know that I can tell you much more There doesnt seem to have
been any difficulty over the money question as we feared there would
be Hes well off it appears and willing to work for nothing

Has he a private fortune then Apparently he has though it seems
rather oddyou heard that night at Fabrizis about the state the Duprez
expedition found him in But he has got shares in mines somewhere out in
Brazil and then he has been immensely successful as a feuilleton writer
in Paris and Vienna and London He seems to have half a dozen languages
at his fingertips and theres nothing to prevent his keeping up his
newspaper connections from here Slanging the Jesuits wont take all his
time

Thats true of course Its time to start Cesare Yes I will wear
the roses Wait just a minute

She ran upstairs and came back with the roses in the bosom of her
dress and a long scarf of black Spanish lace thrown over her head
Martini surveyed her with artistic approval

You look like a queen Madonna mia like the great and wise Queen of
Sheba

What an unkind speech she retorted laughing when you know how hard
Ive been trying to mould myself into the image of the typical society
lady Who wants a conspirator to look like the Queen of Sheba Thats
not the way to keep clear of spies

Youll never be able to personate the stupid society woman if you try
for ever But it doesnt matter after all youre too fair to look upon
for spies to guess your opinions even though you cant simper and hide
behind your fan like Signora Grassini

Now Cesare let that poor woman alone There take some more
barleysugar to sweeten your temper Are you ready Then we had better
start

Martini had been quite right in saying that the conversazione would be
both crowded and dull The literary men talked polite smalltalk and
looked hopelessly bored while the nondescript crowd of tourists and
Russian princes fluttered up and down the rooms asking each other
who were the various celebrities and trying to carry on intellectual
conversation Grassini was receiving his guests with a manner as
carefully polished as his boots but his cold face lighted up at the
sight of Gemma He did not really like her and indeed was secretly a
little afraid of her but he realized that without her his drawing room
would lack a great attraction He had risen high in his profession and
now that he was rich and well known his chief ambition was to make of
his house a centre of liberal and intellectual society He was painfully
conscious that the insignificant overdressed little woman whom in his
youth he had made the mistake of marrying was not fit with her vapid
talk and faded prettiness to be the mistress of a great literary salon
When he could prevail upon Gemma to come he always felt that the evening
would be a success Her quiet graciousness of manner set the guests at
their ease and her very presence seemed to lay the spectre of vulgarity
which always in his imagination haunted the house

Signora Grassini greeted Gemma affectionately exclaiming in a loud
whisper How charming you look tonight and examining the
white cashmere with viciously critical eyes She hated her visitor
rancourously for the very things for which Martini loved her for her
quiet strength of character for her grave sincere directness for the
steady balance of her mind for the very expression of her face
And when Signora Grassini hated a woman she showed it by effusive
tenderness Gemma took the compliments and endearments for what they
were worth and troubled her head no more about them What is called
going into society was in her eyes one of the wearisome and rather
unpleasant tasks which a conspirator who wishes not to attract the
notice of spies must conscientiously fulfil She classed it together
with the laborious work of writing in cipher and knowing how valuable
a practical safeguard against suspicion is the reputation of being a
welldressed woman studied the fashionplates as carefully as she did
the keys of her ciphers

The bored and melancholy literary lions brightened up a little at the
sound of Gemmas name she was very popular among them and the radical
journalists especially gravitated at once to her end of the long room
But she was far too practised a conspirator to let them monopolize her
Radicals could be had any day and now when they came crowding round
her she gently sent them about their business reminding them with a
smile that they need not waste their time on converting her when there
were so many tourists in need of instruction For her part she devoted
herself to an English MP whose sympathies the republican party was
anxious to gain and knowing him to be a specialist on finance she
first won his attention by asking his opinion on a technical
point concerning the Austrian currency and then deftly turned the
conversation to the condition of the LombardoVenetian revenue The
Englishman who had expected to be bored with smalltalk looked askance
at her evidently fearing that he had fallen into the clutches of a
bluestocking but finding that she was both pleasant to look at and
interesting to talk to surrendered completely and plunged into as grave
a discussion of Italian finance as if she had been Metternich When
Grassini brought up a Frenchman who wishes to ask Signora Bolla
something about the history of Young Italy the M P rose with
a bewildered sense that perhaps there was more ground for Italian
discontent than he had supposed

Later in the evening Gemma slipped out on to the terrace under the
drawingroom windows to sit alone for a few moments among the great
camellias and oleanders The close air and continually shifting crowd in
the rooms were beginning to give her a headache At the further end of
the terrace stood a row of palms and treeferns planted in large tubs
which were hidden by a bank of lilies and other flowering plants
The whole formed a complete screen behind which was a little nook
commanding a beautiful view out across the valley The branches of a
pomegranate tree clustered with late blossoms hung beside the narrow
opening between the plants

In this nook Gemma took refuge hoping that no one would guess her
whereabouts until she had secured herself against the threatening
headache by a little rest and silence The night was warm and
beautifully still but coming out from the hot close rooms she felt it
cool and drew her lace scarf about her head

Presently the sounds of voices and footsteps approaching along the
terrace roused her from the dreamy state into which she had fallen She
drew back into the shadow hoping to escape notice and get a few more
precious minutes of silence before again having to rack her tired brain
for conversation To her great annoyance the footsteps paused near to
the screen then Signora Grassinis thin piping little voice broke off
for a moment in its stream of chatter

The other voice a mans was remarkably soft and musical but its
sweetness of tone was marred by a peculiar purring drawl perhaps mere
affectation more probably the result of a habitual effort to conquer
some impediment of speech but in any case very unpleasant

English did you say it asked But surely the name is quite Italian
What was itBolla

Yes she is the widow of poor Giovanni Bolla who died in England
about four years agodont you remember Ah I forgotyou lead such a
wandering life we cant expect you to know of all our unhappy countrys
martyrsthey are so many

Signora Grassini sighed She always talked in this style to strangers
the role of a patriotic mourner for the sorrows of Italy formed an
effective combination with her boardingschool manner and pretty
infantine pout

Died in England repeated the other voice Was he a refugee then
I seem to recognize the name somehow was he not connected with Young
Italy in its early days

Yes he was one of the unfortunate young men who were arrested in
33you remember that sad affair He was released in a few months
then two or three years later when there was a warrant out against him
again he escaped to England The next we heard was that he was married
there It was a most romantic affair altogether but poor Bolla always
was romantic

And then he died in England you say

Yes of consumption he could not stand that terrible English climate
And she lost her only child just before his death it caught scarlet
fever Very sad is it not And we are all so fond of dear Gemma She
is a little stiff poor thing the English always are you know but I
think her troubles have made her melancholy and

Gemma stood up and pushed back the boughs of the pomegranate tree This
retailing of her private sorrows for purposes of smalltalk was almost
unbearable to her and there was visible annoyance in her face as she
stepped into the light

Ah here she is exclaimed the hostess with admirable coolness
Gemma dear I was wondering where you could have disappeared to
Signor Felice Rivarez wishes to make your acquaintance

So its the Gadfly thought Gemma looking at him with some curiosity
He bowed to her decorously enough but his eyes glanced over her
face and figure with a look which seemed to her insolently keen and
inquisitorial

You have found a dddelightful little nook here he remarked looking
at the thick screen and wwwhat a charming view

Yes its a pretty corner I came out here to get some air

It seems almost ungrateful to the good God to stay indoors on such a
lovely night said the hostess raising her eyes to the stars She had
good eyelashes and liked to show them Look signore Would not our
sweet Italy be heaven on earth if only she were free To think that she
should be a bondslave with such flowers and such skies

And such patriotic women the Gadfly murmured in his soft languid
drawl

Gemma glanced round at him in some trepidation his impudence was too
glaring surely to deceive anyone But she had underrated Signora
Grassinis appetite for compliments the poor woman cast down her lashes
with a sigh

Ah signore it is so little that a woman can do Perhaps some day I
may prove my right to the name of an Italianwho knows And now I must
go back to my social duties the French ambassador has begged me to
introduce his ward to all the notabilities you must come in presently
and see her She is a most charming girl Gemma dear I brought Signor
Rivarez out to show him our beautiful view I must leave him under your
care I know you will look after him and introduce him to everyone Ah
there is that delightful Russian prince Have you met him They say he
is a great favourite of the Emperor Nicholas He is military commander
of some Polish town with a name that nobody can pronounce Quelle nuit
magnifique Nestcepas mon prince

She fluttered away chattering volubly to a bullnecked man with a heavy
jaw and a coat glittering with orders and her plaintive dirges for
notre malheureuse patrie interpolated with charmant and mon
prince died away along the terrace

Gemma stood quite still beside the pomegranate tree She was sorry
for the poor silly little woman and annoyed at the Gadflys languid
insolence He was watching the retreating figures with an expression
of face that angered her it seemed ungenerous to mock at such pitiable
creatures

There go Italian andRussian patriotism he said turning to her with
a smile arm in arm and mightily pleased with each others company
Which do you prefer

She frowned slightly and made no answer

Of ccourse he went on its all a question of ppersonal taste but
I think of the two I like the Russian variety bestits so thorough
If Russia had to depend on flowers and skies for her supremacy instead
of on powder and shot how long do you think mon prince would kkeep
that Polish fortress

I think she answered coldly that we can hold our personal opinions
without ridiculing a woman whose guests we are

Ah yes I fforgot the obligations of hospitality here in Italy
they are a wonderfully hospitable people these Italians Im sure the
Austrians find them so Wont you sit down

He limped across the terrace to fetch a chair for her and placed
himself opposite to her leaning against the balustrade The light from
a window was shining full on his face and she was able to study it at
her leisure

She was disappointed She had expected to see a striking and powerful
if not pleasant face but the most salient points of his appearance were
a tendency to foppishness in dress and rather more than a tendency to a
certain veiled insolence of expression and manner For the rest he was
as swarthy as a mulatto and notwithstanding his lameness as agile as
a cat His whole personality was oddly suggestive of a black jaguar
The forehead and left cheek were terribly disfigured by the long crooked
scar of the old sabrecut and she had already noticed that when he
began to stammer in speaking that side of his face was affected with a
nervous twitch But for these defects he would have been in a certain
restless and uncomfortable way rather handsome but it was not an
attractive face

Presently he began again in his soft murmuring purr Just the voice
a jaguar would talk in if it could speak and were in a good humour
Gemma said to herself with rising irritation

I hear he said that you are interested in the radical press and
write for the papers

I write a little I have not time to do much

Ah of course I understood from Signora Grassini that you undertake
other important work as well

Gemma raised her eyebrows slightly Signora Grassini like the silly
little woman she was had evidently been chattering imprudently to this
slippery creature whom Gemma for her part was beginning actually to
dislike

My time is a good deal taken up she said rather stiffly but Signora
Grassini overrates the importance of my occupations They are mostly of
a very trivial character

Well the world would be in a bad way if we ALL of us spent our time in
chanting dirges for Italy I should think the neighbourhood of our
host of this evening and his wife would make anybody frivolous
in selfdefence Oh yes I know what youre going to say you are
perfectly right but they are both so deliciously funny with their
patriotismAre you going in already It is so nice out here

I think I will go in now Is that my scarf Thank you

He had picked it up and now stood looking at her with wide eyes as blue
and innocent as forgetmenots in a brook

I know you are offended with me he said penitently for fooling that
paintedup wax doll but what can a fellow do

Since you ask me I do think it an ungenerous andwellcowardly thing
to hold ones intellectual inferiors up to ridicule in that way it is
like laughing at a cripple or

He caught his breath suddenly painfully and shrank back glancing at
his lame foot and mutilated hand In another instant he recovered his
selfpossession and burst out laughing

Thats hardly a fair comparison signora we cripples dont flaunt our
deformities in peoples faces as she does her stupidity At least give
us credit for recognizing that crooked backs are no pleasanter than
crooked ways There is a step here will you take my arm

She reentered the house in embarrassed silence his unexpected
sensitiveness had completely disconcerted her

Directly he opened the door of the great reception room she realized
that something unusual had happened in her absence Most of the
gentlemen looked both angry and uncomfortable the ladies with hot
cheeks and carefully feigned unconsciousness were all collected at one
end of the room the host was fingering his eyeglasses with suppressed
but unmistakable fury and a little group of tourists stood in a
corner casting amused glances at the further end of the room Evidently
something was going on there which appeared to them in the light of a
joke and to most of the guests in that of an insult Signora Grassini
alone did not appear to have noticed anything she was fluttering her
fan coquettishly and chattering to the secretary of the Dutch embassy
who listened with a broad grin on his face

Gemma paused an instant in the doorway turning to see if the Gadfly
too had noticed the disturbed appearance of the company There was no
mistaking the malicious triumph in his eyes as he glanced from the face
of the blissfully unconscious hostess to a sofa at the end of the room
She understood at once he had brought his mistress here under some
false colour which had deceived no one but Signora Grassini

The gipsygirl was leaning back on the sofa surrounded by a group
of simpering dandies and blandly ironical cavalry officers She was
gorgeously dressed in amber and scarlet with an Oriental brilliancy
of tint and profusion of ornament as startling in a Florentine
literary salon as if she had been some tropical bird among sparrows and
starlings She herself seemed to feel out of place and looked at the
offended ladies with a fiercely contemptuous scowl Catching sight of
the Gadfly as he crossed the room with Gemma she sprang up and came
towards him with a voluble flood of painfully incorrect French

M Rivarez I have been looking for you everywhere Count Saltykov
wants to know whether you can go to his villa tomorrow night There
will be dancing

I am sorry I cant go but then I couldnt dance if I did Signora
Bolla allow me to introduce to you Mme Zita Reni

The gipsy glanced round at Gemma with a half defiant air and bowed
stiffly She was certainly handsome enough as Martini had said with a
vivid animal unintelligent beauty and the perfect harmony and freedom
of her movements were delightful to see but her forehead was low and
narrow and the line of her delicate nostrils was unsympathetic almost
cruel The sense of oppression which Gemma had felt in the Gadflys
society was intensified by the gypsys presence and when a moment
later the host came up to beg Signora Bolla to help him entertain some
tourists in the other room she consented with an odd feeling of relief

 

Well Madonna and what do you think of the Gadfly Martini asked as
they drove back to Florence late at night Did you ever see anything
quite so shameless as the way he fooled that poor little Grassini
woman

About the balletgirl you mean

Yes he persuaded her the girl was going to be the lion of the season
Signora Grassini would do anything for a celebrity

I thought it an unfair and unkind thing to do it put the Grassinis
into a false position and it was nothing less than cruel to the girl
herself I am sure she felt ill at ease

You had a talk with him didnt you What did you think of him

Oh Cesare I didnt think anything except how glad I was to see
the last of him I never met anyone so fearfully tiring He gave me a
headache in ten minutes He is like an incarnate demon of unrest

I thought you wouldnt like him and to tell the truth no more do I
The mans as slippery as an eel I dont trust him



CHAPTER III

THE Gadfly took lodgings outside the Roman gate near to which Zita was
boarding He was evidently somewhat of a sybarite and though nothing
in the rooms showed any serious extravagance there was a tendency to
luxuriousness in trifles and to a certain fastidious daintiness in the
arrangement of everything which surprised Galli and Riccardo They
had expected to find a man who had lived among the wildernesses of the
Amazon more simple in his tastes and wondered at his spotless ties and
rows of boots and at the masses of flowers which always stood upon
his writing table On the whole they got on very well with him He was
hospitable and friendly to everyone especially to the local members
of the Mazzinian party To this rule Gemma apparently formed an
exception he seemed to have taken a dislike to her from the time of
their first meeting and in every way avoided her company On two or
three occasions he was actually rude to her thus bringing upon himself
Martinis most cordial detestation There had been no love lost between
the two men from the beginning their temperaments appeared to be too
incompatible for them to feel anything but repugnance for each other On
Martinis part this was fast developing into hostility

I dont care about his not liking me he said one day to Gemma with
an aggrieved air I dont like him for that matter so theres no harm
done But I cant stand the way he behaves to you If it werent for the
scandal it would make in the party first to beg a man to come and then
to quarrel with him I should call him to account for it

Let him alone Cesare it isnt of any consequence and after all its
as much my fault as his

What is your fault

That he dislikes me so I said a brutal thing to him when we first met
that night at the Grassinis

YOU said a brutal thing Thats hard to believe Madonna

It was unintentional of course and I was very sorry I said something
about people laughing at cripples and he took it personally It had
never occurred to me to think of him as a cripple he is not so badly
deformed

Of course not He has one shoulder higher than the other and his
left arm is pretty badly disabled but hes neither hunchbacked nor
clubfooted As for his lameness it isnt worth talking about

Anyway he shivered all over and changed colour Of course it was
horribly tactless of me but its odd he should be so sensitive I
wonder if he has ever suffered from any cruel jokes of that kind

Much more likely to have perpetrated them I should think Theres a
sort of internal brutality about that man under all his fine manners
that is perfectly sickening to me

Now Cesare thats downright unfair I dont like him any more than
you do but what is the use of making him out worse than he is His
manner is a little affected and irritatingI expect he has been too
much lionizedand the everlasting smart speeches are dreadfully tiring
but I dont believe he means any harm

I dont know what he means but theres something not clean about a
man who sneers at everything It fairly disgusted me the other day at
Fabrizis debate to hear the way he cried down the reforms in Rome just
as if he wanted to find a foul motive for everything

Gemma sighed I am afraid I agreed better with him than with you on
that point she said All you good people are so full of the most
delightful hopes and expectations you are always ready to think that
if one wellmeaning middleaged gentleman happens to get elected Pope
everything else will come right of itself He has only got to throw open
the prison doors and give his blessing to everybody all round and we
may expect the millennium within three months You never seem able to
see that he cant set things right even if he would Its the principle
of the thing thats wrong not the behaviour of this man or that

What principle The temporal power of the Pope

Why that in particular Thats merely a part of the general wrong The
bad principle is that any man should hold over another the power to bind
and loose Its a false relationship to stand in towards ones fellows

Martini held up his hands That will do Madonna he said laughing
I am not going to discuss with you once you begin talking rank
Antinomianism in that fashion Im sure your ancestors must have been
English Levellers in the seventeenth century Besides what I came round
about is this MS

He pulled it out of his pocket

Another new pamphlet

A stupid thing this wretched man Rivarez sent in to yesterdays
committee I knew we should come to loggerheads with him before long

What is the matter with it Honestly Cesare I think you are a little
prejudiced Rivarez may be unpleasant but hes not stupid

Oh I dont deny that this is clever enough in its way but you had
better read the thing yourself

The pamphlet was a skit on the wild enthusiasm over the new Pope with
which Italy was still ringing Like all the Gadflys writing it was
bitter and vindictive but notwithstanding her irritation at the
style Gemma could not help recognizing in her heart the justice of the
criticism

I quite agree with you that it is detestably malicious she said
laying down the manuscript But the worst thing about it is that its
all true

Gemma

Yes but it is The mans a coldblooded eel if you like but hes
got the truth on his side There is no use in our trying to persuade
ourselves that this doesnt hit the markit does

Then do you suggest that we should print it

Ah thats quite another matter I certainly dont think we ought to
print it as it stands it would hurt and alienate everybody and do no
good But if he would rewrite it and cut out the personal attacks
I think it might be made into a really valuable piece of work As
political criticism it is very fine I had no idea he could write so
well He says things which need saying and which none of us have had
the courage to say This passage where he compares Italy to a tipsy
man weeping with tenderness on the neck of the thief who is picking his
pocket is splendidly written

Gemma The very worst bit in the whole thing I hate that illnatured
yelping at everything and everybody

So do I but thats not the point Rivarez has a very disagreeable
style and as a human being he is not attractive but when he says that
we have made ourselves drunk with processions and embracing and shouting
about love and reconciliation and that the Jesuits and Sanfedists are
the people who will profit by it all hes right a thousand times I
wish I could have been at the committee yesterday What decision did you
finally arrive at

What I have come here about to ask you to go and talk it over with him
and persuade him to soften the thing

Me But I hardly know the man and besides that he detests me Why
should I go of all people

Simply because theres no one else to do it today Besides you
are more reasonable than the rest of us and wont get into useless
arguments and quarrel with him as we should

I shant do that certainly Well I will go if you like though I have
not much hope of success

I am sure you will be able to manage him if you try Yes and tell him
that the committee all admired the thing from a literary point of view
That will put him into a good humour and its perfectly true too

 

The Gadfly was sitting beside a table covered with flowers and ferns
staring absently at the floor with an open letter on his knee A shaggy
collie dog lying on a rug at his feet raised its head and growled as
Gemma knocked at the open door and the Gadfly rose hastily and bowed
in a stiff ceremonious way His face had suddenly grown hard and
expressionless

You are too kind he said in his most chilling manner If you had let
me know that you wanted to speak to me I would have called on you

Seeing that he evidently wished her at the end of the earth Gemma
hastened to state her business He bowed again and placed a chair for
her

The committee wished me to call upon you she began because there
has been a certain difference of opinion about your pamphlet

So I expected He smiled and sat down opposite to her drawing a large
vase of chrysanthemums between his face and the light

Most of the members agreed that however much they may admire the
pamphlet as a literary composition they do not think that in its
present form it is quite suitable for publication They fear that the
vehemence of its tone may give offence and alienate persons whose help
and support are valuable to the party

He pulled a chrysanthemum from the vase and began slowly plucking
off one white petal after another As her eyes happened to catch the
movement of the slim right hand dropping the petals one by one an
uncomfortable sensation came over Gemma as though she had somewhere
seen that gesture before

As a literary composition he remarked in his soft cold voice it is
utterly worthless and could be admired only by persons who know nothing
about literature As for its giving offence that is the very thing I
intended it to do

That I quite understand The question is whether you may not succeed in
giving offence to the wrong people

He shrugged his shoulders and put a tornoff petal between his teeth I
think you are mistaken he said The question is For what purpose
did your committee invite me to come here I understood to expose and
ridicule the Jesuits I fulfil my obligation to the best of my ability

And I can assure you that no one has any doubt as to either the ability
or the goodwill What the committee fears is that the liberal party may
take offence and also that the town workmen may withdraw their
moral support You may have meant the pamphlet for an attack upon the
Sanfedists but many readers will construe it as an attack upon the
Church and the new Pope and this as a matter of political tactics the
committee does not consider desirable

I begin to understand So long as I keep to the particular set of
clerical gentlemen with whom the party is just now on bad terms I
may speak sooth if the fancy takes me but directly I touch upon the
committees own pet prieststruths a dog must to kennel he must be
whipped out when theHoly Father may stand by the fire and Yes
the fool was right Id rather be any kind of a thing than a fool Of
course I must bow to the committees decision but I continue to
think that it has pared its wit o both sides and leftMmonsignor
Mmmontannnelli in the middle

Montanelli Gemma repeated I dont understand you Do you mean the
Bishop of Brisighella

Yes the new Pope has just created him a Cardinal you know I have a
letter about him here Would you care to hear it The writer is a friend
of mine on the other side of the frontier

The Papal frontier

Yes This is what he writes He took up the letter which had been
in his hand when she entered and read aloud suddenly beginning to
stammer violently

Yoyou will ssssoon have the ppleasure of mmmeeting one of our
wwworst enemies Ccardinal Lorenzo Mmontannnelli the Bbbishop
of Brisigghella He intt

He broke off paused a moment and began again very slowly and drawling
insufferably but no longer stammering

He intends to visit Tuscany during the coming month on a mission of
reconciliation He will preach first in Florence where he will stay for
about three weeks then will go on to Siena and Pisa and return to the
Romagna by Pistoja He ostensibly belongs to the liberal party in the
Church and is a personal friend of the Pope and Cardinal Feretti Under
Gregory he was out of favour and was kept out of sight in a little
hole in the Apennines Now he has come suddenly to the front Really
of course he is as much pulled by Jesuit wires as any Sanfedist in the
country This mission was suggested by some of the Jesuit fathers He is
one of the most brilliant preachers in the Church and as mischievous
in his way as Lambruschini himself His business is to keep the popular
enthusiasm over the Pope from subsiding and to occupy the public
attention until the Grand Duke has signed a project which the agents of
the Jesuits are preparing to lay before him What this project is I have
been unable to discover Then further on it says Whether Montanelli
understands for what purpose he is being sent to Tuscany or whether
the Jesuits are playing on him I cannot make out He is either an
uncommonly clever knave or the biggest ass that was ever foaled The
odd thing is that so far as I can discover he neither takes bribes nor
keeps mistressesthe first time I ever came across such a thing

He laid down the letter and sat looking at her with halfshut eyes
waiting apparently for her to speak

Are you satisfied that your informant is correct in his facts she
asked after a moment

As to the irreproachable character of Monsignor Mmonttannellis
private life No but neither is he As you will observe he puts in the
sssaving clause So far as I ccan discover

I was not speaking of that she interposed coldly but of the part
about this mission

I can fully trust the writer He is an old friend of mineone of my
comrades of 43 and he is in a position which gives him exceptional
opportunities for finding out things of that kind

Some official at the Vatican thought Gemma quickly So thats the
kind of connections you have I guessed there was something of that
sort

This letter is of course a private one the Gadfly went on and you
understand that the information is to be kept strictly to the members of
your committee

That hardly needs saying Then about the pamphlet may I tell the
committee that you consent to make a few alterations and soften it a
little or that

Dont you think the alterations may succeed in spoiling the beauty
of the literary composition signora as well as in reducing the
vehemence of the tone

You are asking my personal opinion What I have come here to express is
that of the committee as a whole

Does that imply that yyyou disagree with the committee as a whole
He had put the letter into his pocket and was now leaning forward
and looking at her with an eager concentrated expression which quite
changed the character of his face You think

If you care to know what I personally thinkI disagree with the
majority on both points I do not at all admire the pamphlet from a
literary point of view and I do think it true as a presentation of
facts and wise as a matter of tactics

That is

I quite agree with you that Italy is being led away by a
willothewisp and that all this enthusiasm and rejoicing will
probably land her in a terrible bog and I should be most heartily glad
to have that openly and boldly said even at the cost of offending or
alienating some of our present supporters But as a member of a body the
large majority of which holds the opposite view I cannot insist upon my
personal opinion and I certainly think that if things of that kind are
to be said at all they should be said temperately and quietly not in
the tone adopted in this pamphlet

Will you wait a minute while I look through the manuscript

He took it up and glanced down the pages A dissatisfied frown settled
on his face

Yes of course you are perfectly right The things written like a
cafe chantant skit not a political satire But whats a man to do If
I write decently the public wont understand it they will say its dull
if it isnt spiteful enough

Dont you think spitefulness manages to be dull when we get too much of
it

He threw a keen rapid glance at her and burst out laughing

Apparently the signora belongs to the dreadful category of people who
are always right Then if I yield to the temptation to be spiteful
I may come in time to be as dull as Signora Grassini Heavens what a
fate No you neednt frown I know you dont like me and I am going to
keep to business What it comes to then is practically this if I cut
out the personalities and leave the essential part of the thing as
it is the committee will very much regret that they cant take the
responsibility of printing it If I cut out the political truth and
make all the hard names apply to no one but the partys enemies the
committee will praise the thing up to the skies and you and I will know
its not worth printing Rather a nice point of metaphysics Which is
the more desirable condition to be printed and not be worth it or to
be worth it and not be printed Well signora

I do not think you are tied to any such alternative I believe that
if you were to cut out the personalities the committee would consent to
print the pamphlet though the majority would of course not agree with
it and I am convinced that it would be very useful But you would
have to lay aside the spitefulness If you are going to say a thing the
substance of which is a big pill for your readers to swallow there is
no use in frightening them at the beginning by the form

He sighed and shrugged his shoulders resignedly I submit signora but
on one condition If you rob me of my laugh now I must have it out
next time When His Eminence the irreproachable Cardinal turns up
in Florence neither you nor your committee must object to my being as
spiteful as I like Its my due

He spoke in his lightest coldest manner pulling the chrysanthemums
out of their vase and holding them up to watch the light through the
translucent petals What an unsteady hand he has she thought seeing
how the flowers shook and quivered Surely he doesnt drink

You had better discuss the matter with the other members of the
committee she said rising I cannot form any opinion as to what they
will think about it

And you He had risen too and was leaning against the table pressing
the flowers to his face

She hesitated The question distressed her bringing up old and
miserable associations Ihardly know she said at last Many years
ago I used to know something about Monsignor Montanelli He was only
a canon at that time and Director of the theological seminary in
the province where I lived as a girl I heard a great deal about him
fromsomeone who knew him very intimately and I never heard anything
of him that was not good I believe that in those days at least he
was really a most remarkable man But that was long ago and he may have
changed Irresponsible power corrupts so many people

The Gadfly raised his head from the flowers and looked at her with a
steady face

At any rate he said if Monsignor Montanelli is not himself a
scoundrel he is a tool in scoundrelly hands It is all one to me which
he isand to my friends across the frontier A stone in the path may
have the best intentions but it must be kicked out of the path for all
that Allow me signora He rang the bell and limping to the door
opened it for her to pass out

It was very kind of you to call signora May I send for a vettura No
Goodafternoon then Bianca open the halldoor please

Gemma went out into the street pondering anxiously My friends across
the frontierwho were they And how was the stone to be kicked out of
the path If with satire only why had he said it with such dangerous
eyes



CHAPTER IV

MONSIGNOR MONTANELLI arrived in Florence in the first week of October
His visit caused a little flutter of excitement throughout the town He
was a famous preacher and a representative of the reformed Papacy and
people looked eagerly to him for an exposition of the new doctrine
the gospel of love and reconciliation which was to cure the sorrows of
Italy The nomination of Cardinal Gizzi to the Roman State Secretaryship
in place of the universally detested Lambruschini had raised the public
enthusiasm to its highest pitch and Montanelli was just the man who
could most easily sustain it The irreproachable strictness of his life
was a phenomenon sufficiently rare among the high dignitaries of the
Roman Church to attract the attention of people accustomed to regard
blackmailing peculation and disreputable intrigues as almost
invariable adjuncts to the career of a prelate Moreover his talent as
a preacher was really great and with his beautiful voice and magnetic
personality he would in any time and place have made his mark

Grassini as usual strained every nerve to get the newly arrived
celebrity to his house but Montanelli was no easy game to catch To
all invitations he replied with the same courteous but positive refusal
saying that his health was bad and his time fully occupied and that he
had neither strength nor leisure for going into society

What omnivorous creatures those Grassinis are Martini said
contemptuously to Gemma as they crossed the Signoria square one bright
cold Sunday morning Did you notice the way Grassini bowed when the
Cardinals carriage drove up Its all one to them who a man is so long
as hes talked about I never saw such lionhunters in my life Only
last August it was the Gadfly now its Montanelli I hope His Eminence
feels flattered at the attention a precious lot of adventurers have
shared it with him

They had been hearing Montanelli preach in the Cathedral and the great
building had been so thronged with eager listeners that Martini fearing
a return of Gemmas troublesome headaches had persuaded her to come
away before the Mass was over The sunny morning the first after a week
of rain offered him an excuse for suggesting a walk among the garden
slopes by San Niccolo

No she answered I should like a walk if you have time but not to
the hills Let us keep along the LungArno Montanelli will pass on
his way back from church and I am like GrassiniI want to see the
notability

But you have just seen him

Not close There was such a crush in the Cathedral and his back was
turned to us when the carriage passed If we keep near to the bridge
we shall be sure to see him wellhe is staying on the LungArno you
know

But what has given you such a sudden fancy to see Montanelli You never
used to care about famous preachers

It is not famous preachers it is the man himself I want to see how
much he has changed since I saw him last

When was that

Two days after Arthurs death

Martini glanced at her anxiously They had come out on to the LungArno
and she was staring absently across the water with a look on her face
that he hated to see

Gemma dear he said after a moment are you going to let that
miserable business haunt you all your life We have all made mistakes
when we were seventeen

We have not all killed our dearest friend when we were seventeen she
answered wearily and leaning her arm on the stone balustrade of the
bridge looked down into the river Martini held his tongue he was
almost afraid to speak to her when this mood was on her

I never look down at water without remembering she said slowly
raising her eyes to his then with a nervous little shiver Let us walk
on a bit Cesare it is chilly for standing

They crossed the bridge in silence and walked on along the riverside
After a few minutes she spoke again

What a beautiful voice that man has There is something about it that I
have never heard in any other human voice I believe it is the secret of
half his influence

It is a wonderful voice Martini assented catching at a subject of
conversation which might lead her away from the dreadful memory called
up by the river and he is apart from his voice about the finest
preacher I have ever heard But I believe the secret of his influence
lies deeper than that It is the way his life stands out from that of
almost all the other prelates I dont know whether you could lay your
hand on one other high dignitary in all the Italian Churchexcept the
Pope himselfwhose reputation is so utterly spotless I remember when
I was in the Romagna last year passing through his diocese and seeing
those fierce mountaineers waiting in the rain to get a glimpse of him or
touch his dress He is venerated there almost as a saint and that means
a good deal among the Romagnols who generally hate everything that
wears a cassock I remarked to one of the old peasantsas typical a
smuggler as ever I saw in my lifethat the people seemed very much
devoted to their bishop and he said We dont love bishops they are
liars we love Monsignor Montanelli Nobody has ever known him to tell a
lie or do an unjust thing

I wonder Gemma said half to herself if he knows the people think
that about him

Why shouldnt he know it Do you think it is not true

I know it is not true

How do you know it

Because he told me so

HE told you Montanelli Gemma what do you mean

She pushed the hair back from her forehead and turned towards him They
were standing still again he leaning on the balustrade and she slowly
drawing lines on the pavement with the point of her umbrella

Cesare you and I have been friends for all these years and I have
never told you what really happened about Arthur

There is no need to tell me dear he broke in hastily I know all
about it already

Giovanni told you

Yes when he was dying He told me about it one night when I was
sitting up with him He said Gemma dear I had better tell you the
truth now we have begun talking about ithe said that you were always
brooding over that wretched story and he begged me to be as good a
friend to you as I could and try to keep you from thinking of it And I
have tried to dear though I may not have succeededI have indeed

I know you have she answered softly raising her eyes for a moment
I should have been badly off without your friendship ButGiovanni did
not tell you about Monsignor Montanelli then

No I didnt know that he had anything to do with it What he told me
was aboutall that affair with the spy and about

About my striking Arthur and his drowning himself Well I will tell
you about Montanelli

They turned back towards the bridge over which the Cardinals carriage
would have to pass Gemma looked out steadily across the water as she
spoke

In those days Montanelli was a canon he was Director of the
Theological Seminary at Pisa and used to give Arthur lessons in
philosophy and read with him after he went up to the Sapienza They were
perfectly devoted to each other more like two lovers than teacher and
pupil Arthur almost worshipped the ground that Montanelli walked on
and I remember his once telling me that if he lost his Padrehe
always used to call Montanelli sohe should go and drown himself Well
then you know what happened about the spy The next day my father and
the BurtonsArthurs stepbrothers most detestable peoplespent the
whole day dragging the Darsena basin for the body and I sat in my room
alone and thought of what I had done

She paused a moment and went on again

Late in the evening my father came into my room and said Gemma
child come downstairs theres a man I want you to see And when we
went down there was one of the students belonging to the group sitting
in the consulting room all white and shaking and he told us about
Giovannis second letter coming from the prison to say that they had
heard from the jailer about Cardi and that Arthur had been tricked in
the confessional I remember the student saying to me It is at least
some consolation that we know he was innocent My father held my hands
and tried to comfort me he did not know then about the blow Then I
went back to my room and sat there all night alone In the morning my
father went out again with the Burtons to see the harbour dragged They
had some hope of finding the body there

It was never found was it

No it must have got washed out to sea but they thought there was a
chance I was alone in my room and the servant came up to say that a
reverendissimo padre had called and she had told him my father was at
the docks and he had gone away I knew it must be Montanelli so I ran
out at the back door and caught him up at the garden gate When I said
Canon Montanelli I want to speak to you he just stopped and waited
silently for me to speak Oh Cesare if you had seen his faceit
haunted me for months afterwards I said I am Dr Warrens daughter
and I have come to tell you that it is I who have killed Arthur I told
him everything and he stood and listened like a figure cut in stone
till I had finished then he said Set your heart at rest my child it
is I that am a murderer not you I deceived him and he found it out
And with that he turned and went out at the gate without another word

And then

I dont know what happened to him after that I heard the same evening
that he had fallen down in the street in a kind of fit and had been
carried into a house near the docks but that is all I know My father
did everything he could for me when I told him about it he threw up
his practice and took me away to England at once so that I should never
hear anything that could remind me He was afraid I should end in the
water too and indeed I believe I was near it at one time But then
you know when we found out that my father had cancer I was obliged to
come to myselfthere was no one else to nurse him And after he died
I was left with the little ones on my hands until my elder brother was
able to give them a home Then there was Giovanni Do you know when
he came to England we were almost afraid to meet each other with that
frightful memory between us He was so bitterly remorseful for his share
in it allthat unhappy letter he wrote from prison But I believe
really it was our common trouble that drew us together

Martini smiled and shook his head

It may have been so on your side he said but Giovanni had made up
his mind from the first time he ever saw you I remember his coming back
to Milan after that first visit to Leghorn and raving about you to me
till I was perfectly sick of hearing of the English Gemma I thought I
should hate you Ah there it comes

The carriage crossed the bridge and drove up to a large house on the
LungArno Montanelli was leaning back on the cushions as if too tired
to care any longer for the enthusiastic crowd which had collected round
the door to catch a glimpse of him The inspired look that his face had
worn in the Cathedral had faded quite away and the sunlight showed the
lines of care and fatigue When he had alighted and passed with the
heavy spiritless tread of weary and heartsick old age into the house
Gemma turned away and walked slowly to the bridge Her face seemed for
a moment to reflect the withered hopeless look of his Martini walked
beside her in silence

I have so often wondered she began again after a little pause what
he meant about the deception It has sometimes occurred to me

Yes

Well it is very strange there was the most extraordinary personal
resemblance between them

Between whom

Arthur and Montanelli It was not only I who noticed it And there was
something mysterious in the relationship between the members of that
household Mrs Burton Arthurs mother was one of the sweetest women
I ever knew Her face had the same spiritual look as Arthurs and I
believe they were alike in character too But she always seemed half
frightened like a detected criminal and her stepsons wife used to
treat her as no decent person treats a dog And then Arthur himself was
such a startling contrast to all those vulgar Burtons Of course when
one is a child one takes everything for granted but looking back on it
afterwards I have often wondered whether Arthur was really a Burton

Possibly he found out something about his motherthat may easily
have been the cause of his death not the Cardi affair at all Martini
interposed offering the only consolation he could think of at the
moment Gemma shook her head

If you could have seen his face after I struck him Cesare you would
not think that It may be all true about Montanellivery likely it
isbut what I have done I have done

They walked on a little way without speaking

My dear Martini said at last if there were any way on earth to undo
a thing that is once done it would be worth while to brood over our old
mistakes but as it is let the dead bury their dead It is a terrible
story but at least the poor lad is out of it now and luckier than some
of those that are leftthe ones that are in exile and in prison You
and I have them to think of we have no right to eat out our hearts for
the dead Remember what your own Shelley says The past is Deaths
the future is thine own Take it while it is still yours and fix your
mind not on what you may have done long ago to hurt but on what you
can do now to help

In his earnestness he had taken her hand He dropped it suddenly and
drew back at the sound of a soft cold drawling voice behind him

Monsignor Montannnelli murmured this languid voice is undoubtedly
all you say my dear doctor In fact he appears to be so much too good
for this world that he ought to be politely escorted into the next I
am sure he would cause as great a sensation there as he has done here
there are ppprobably many oldestablished ghosts who have never seen
such a thing as an honest cardinal And there is nothing that ghosts
love as they do novelties

How do you know that asked Dr Riccardos voice in a tone of
illsuppressed irritation

From Holy Writ my dear sir If the Gospel is to be trusted even the
most respectable of all Ghosts had a fffancy for capricious alliances
Now honesty and cccardinalsthat seems to me a somewhat capricious
alliance and rather an uncomfortable one like shrimps and liquorice
Ah Signor Martini and Signora Bolla Lovely weather after the rain is
it not Have you been to hear the nnew Savonarola too

Martini turned round sharply The Gadfly with a cigar in his mouth and
a hothouse flower in his buttonhole was holding out to him a slender
carefullygloved hand With the sunlight reflected in his immaculate
boots and glancing back from the water on to his smiling face he looked
to Martini less lame and more conceited than usual They were shaking
hands affably on the one side and rather sulkily on the other when
Riccardo hastily exclaimed

I am afraid Signora Bolla is not well

She was so pale that her face looked almost livid under the shadow of
her bonnet and the ribbon at her throat fluttered perceptibly from the
violent beating of the heart

I will go home she said faintly

A cab was called and Martini got in with her to see her safely home As
the Gadfly bent down to arrange her cloak which was hanging over the
wheel he raised his eyes suddenly to her face and Martini saw that she
shrank away with a look of something like terror

Gemma what is the matter with you he asked in English when they
had started What did that scoundrel say to you

Nothing Cesare it was no fault of his IIhad a fright

A fright

Yes I fancied She put one hand over her eyes and he waited
silently till she should recover her selfcommand Her face was already
regaining its natural colour

You are quite right she said at last turning to him and speaking in
her usual voice it is worse than useless to look back at a horrible
past It plays tricks with ones nerves and makes one imagine all sorts
of impossible things We will NEVER talk about that subject again
Cesare or I shall see fantastic likenesses to Arthur in every face I
meet It is a kind of hallucination like a nightmare in broad daylight
Just now when that odious little fop came up I fancied it was Arthur



CHAPTER V

THE Gadfly certainly knew how to make personal enemies He had arrived
in Florence in August and by the end of October threefourths of the
committee which had invited him shared Martinis opinion His savage
attacks upon Montanelli had annoyed even his admirers and Galli
himself who at first had been inclined to uphold everything the witty
satirist said or did began to acknowledge with an aggrieved air that
Montanelli had better have been left in peace Decent cardinals are
none so plenty One might treat them politely when they do turn up

The only person who apparently remained quite indifferent to the storm
of caricatures and pasquinades was Montanelli himself It seemed as
Martini said hardly worth while to expend ones energy in ridiculing
a man who took it so goodhumouredly It was said in the town that
Montanelli one day when the Archbishop of Florence was dining with
him had found in the room one of the Gadflys bitter personal lampoons
against himself had read it through and handed the paper to the
Archbishop remarking That is rather cleverly put is it not

One day there appeared in the town a leaflet headed The Mystery
of the Annunciation Even had the author omitted his now familiar
signature a sketch of a gadfly with spread wings the bitter trenchant
style would have left in the minds of most readers no doubt as to his
identity The skit was in the form of a dialogue between Tuscany as
the Virgin Mary and Montanelli as the angel who bearing the lilies of
purity and crowned with the olive branch of peace was announcing the
advent of the Jesuits The whole thing was full of offensive personal
allusions and hints of the most risky nature and all Florence felt the
satire to be both ungenerous and unfair And yet all Florence laughed
There was something so irresistible in the Gadflys grave absurdities
that those who most disapproved of and disliked him laughed as
immoderately at all his squibs as did his warmest partisans Repulsive
in tone as the leaflet was it left its trace upon the popular feeling
of the town Montanellis personal reputation stood too high for any
lampoon however witty seriously to injure it but for a moment the
tide almost turned against him The Gadfly had known where to sting
and though eager crowds still collected before the Cardinals house
to see him enter or leave his carriage ominous cries of Jesuit and
Sanfedist spy often mingled with the cheers and benedictions

But Montanelli had no lack of supporters Two days after the publication
of the skit the Churchman a leading clerical paper brought out
a brilliant article called An Answer to The Mystery of the
Annunciation and signed A Son of the Church It was an impassioned
defence of Montanelli against the Gadflys slanderous imputations The
anonymous writer after expounding with great eloquence and fervour
the doctrine of peace on earth and good will towards men of which the
new Pontiff was the evangelist concluded by challenging the Gadfly
to prove a single one of his assertions and solemnly appealing to the
public not to believe a contemptible slanderer Both the cogency of
the article as a bit of special pleading and its merit as a literary
composition were sufficiently far above the average to attract much
attention in the town especially as not even the editor of the
newspaper could guess the authors identity The article was soon
reprinted separately in pamphlet form and the anonymous defender was
discussed in every coffeeshop in Florence

The Gadfly responded with a violent attack on the new Pontificate and
all its supporters especially on Montanelli who he cautiously
hinted had probably consented to the panegyric on himself To this
the anonymous defender again replied in the Churchman with an indignant
denial During the rest of Montanellis stay the controversy raging
between the two writers occupied more of the public attention than did
even the famous preacher himself

Some members of the liberal party ventured to remonstrate with the
Gadfly about the unnecessary malice of his tone towards Montanelli but
they did not get much satisfaction out of him He only smiled affably
and answered with a languid little stammer Rreally gentlemen you
are rather unfair I expressly stipulated when I gave in to Signora
Bolla that I should be allowed a lllittle chuckle all to myself now
It is so nominated in the bond

At the end of October Montanelli returned to his see in the Romagna
and before leaving Florence preached a farewell sermon in which he
spoke of the controversy gently deprecating the vehemence of both
writers and begging his unknown defender to set an example of tolerance
by closing a useless and unseemly war of words On the following day the
Churchman contained a notice that at Monsignor Montanellis publicly
expressed desire A Son of the Church would withdraw from the
controversy

The last word remained with the Gadfly He issued a little leaflet
in which he declared himself disarmed and converted by Montanellis
Christian meekness and ready to weep tears of reconciliation upon the
neck of the first Sanfedist he met I am even willing he concluded
to embrace my anonymous challenger himself and if my readers knew as
his Eminence and I know what that implies and why he remains anonymous
they would believe in the sincerity of my conversion

In the latter part of November he announced to the literary committee
that he was going for a fortnights holiday to the seaside He went
apparently to Leghorn but Dr Riccardo going there soon after and
wishing to speak to him searched the town for him in vain On the 5th
of December a political demonstration of the most extreme character
burst out in the States of the Church along the whole chain of the
Apennines and people began to guess the reason of the Gadflys sudden
fancy to take his holidays in the depth of winter He came back to
Florence when the riots had been quelled and meeting Riccardo in the
street remarked affably

I hear you were inquiring for me in Leghorn I was staying in Pisa
What a pretty old town it is Theres something quite Arcadian about
it

In Christmas week he attended an afternoon meeting of the literary
committee which was held in Dr Riccardos lodgings near the Porta alla
Croce The meeting was a full one and when he came in a little late
with an apologetic bow and smile there seemed to be no seat empty
Riccardo rose to fetch a chair from the next room but the Gadfly
stopped him Dont trouble about it he said I shall be quite
comfortable here and crossing the room to a window beside which
Gemma had placed her chair he sat down on the sill leaning his head
indolently back against the shutter

As he looked down at Gemma smiling with halfshut eyes in the subtle
sphinxlike way that gave him the look of a Leonardo da Vinci portrait
the instinctive distrust with which he inspired her deepened into a
sense of unreasoning fear

The proposal under discussion was that a pamphlet be issued setting
forth the committees views on the dearth with which Tuscany was
threatened and the measures which should be taken to meet it The
matter was a somewhat difficult one to decide because as usual the
committees views upon the subject were much divided The more advanced
section to which Gemma Martini and Riccardo belonged was in favour
of an energetic appeal to both government and public to take adequate
measures at once for the relief of the peasantry The moderate
divisionincluding of course Grassinifeared that an overemphatic
tone might irritate rather than convince the ministry

It is all very well gentlemen to want the people helped at once he
said looking round upon the redhot radicals with his calm and pitying
air We most of us want a good many things that we are not likely to
get but if we start with the tone you propose to adopt the government
is very likely not to begin any relief measures at all till there is
actual famine If we could only induce the ministry to make an inquiry
into the state of the crops it would be a step in advance

Galli in his corner by the stove jumped up to answer his enemy

A step in advanceyes my dear sir but if theres going to be a
famine it wont wait for us to advance at that pace The people might
all starve before we got to any actual relief

It would be interesting to know Sacconi began but several voices
interrupted him

Speak up we cant hear

I should think not with such an infernal row in the street said
Galli irritably Is that window shut Riccardo One cant hear ones
self speak

Gemma looked round Yes she said the window is quite shut I think
there is a variety show or some such thing passing

The sounds of shouting and laughter of the tinkling of bells and
trampling of feet resounded from the street below mixed with the
braying of a villainous brass band and the unmerciful banging of a drum

It cant be helped these few days said Riccardo we must expect
noise at Christmas time What were you saying Sacconi

I said it would be interesting to hear what is thought about the matter
in Pisa and Leghorn Perhaps Signor Rivarez can tell us something he
has just come from there

The Gadfly did not answer He was staring out of the window and appeared
not to have heard what had been said

Signor Rivarez said Gemma She was the only person sitting near to
him and as he remained silent she bent forward and touched him on the
arm He slowly turned his face to her and she started as she saw its
fixed and awful immobility For a moment it was like the face of a
corpse then the lips moved in a strange lifeless way

Yes he whispered a variety show

Her first instinct was to shield him from the curiosity of the others
Without understanding what was the matter with him she realized that
some frightful fancy or hallucination had seized upon him and that for
the moment he was at its mercy body and soul She rose quickly and
standing between him and the company threw the window open as if to
look out No one but herself had seen his face

In the street a travelling circus was passing with mountebanks on
donkeys and harlequins in particoloured dresses The crowd of holiday
masqueraders laughing and shoving was exchanging jests and showers of
paper ribbon with the clowns and flinging little bags of sugarplums to
the columbine who sat in her car tricked out in tinsel and feathers
with artificial curls on her forehead and an artificial smile on her
painted lips Behind the car came a motley string of figuresstreet
Arabs beggars clowns turning somersaults and costermongers hawking
their wares They were jostling pelting and applauding a figure which
at first Gemma could not see for the pushing and swaying of the crowd
The next moment however she saw plainly what it wasa hunchback
dwarfish and ugly grotesquely attired in a fools dress with paper
cap and bells He evidently belonged to the strolling company and was
amusing the crowd with hideous grimaces and contortions

What is going on out there asked Riccardo approaching the window
You seem very much interested

He was a little surprised at their keeping the whole committee waiting
to look at a strolling company of mountebanks Gemma turned round

It is nothing interesting she said only a variety show but they
made such a noise that I thought it must be something else

She was standing with one hand upon the windowsill and suddenly felt
the Gadflys cold fingers press the hand with a passionate clasp Thank
you he whispered softly and then closing the window sat down again
upon the sill

Im afraid he said in his airy manner that I have interrupted you
gentlemen I was llooking at the variety show it is ssuch a ppretty
sight

Sacconi was asking you a question said Martini gruffly The Gadflys
behaviour seemed to him an absurd piece of affectation and he was
annoyed that Gemma should have been tactless enough to follow his
example It was not like her

The Gadfly disclaimed all knowledge of the state of feeling in Pisa
explaining that he had been there only on a holiday He then plunged
at once into an animated discussion first of agricultural prospects
then of the pamphlet question and continued pouring out a flood of
stammering talk till the others were quite tired He seemed to find some
feverish delight in the sound of his own voice

When the meeting ended and the members of the committee rose to go
Riccardo came up to Martini

Will you stop to dinner with me Fabrizi and Sacconi have promised to
stay

Thanks but I was going to see Signora Bolla home

Are you really afraid I cant get home by myself she asked rising
and putting on her wrap Of course he will stay with you Dr Riccardo
its good for him to get a change He doesnt go out half enough

If you will allow me I will see you home the Gadfly interposed I
am going in that direction

If you really are going that way

I suppose you wont have time to drop in here in the course of the
evening will you Rivarez asked Riccardo as he opened the door for
them

The Gadfly looked back over his shoulder laughing I my dear fellow
Im going to see the variety show

What a strange creature that is and what an odd affection for
mountebanks said Riccardo coming back to his visitors

Case of a fellowfeeling I should think said Martini the mans a
mountebank himself if ever I saw one

I wish I could think he was only that Fabrizi interposed with a
grave face If he is a mountebank I am afraid hes a very dangerous
one

Dangerous in what way

Well I dont like those mysterious little pleasure trips that he is so
fond of taking This is the third time you know and I dont believe he
has been in Pisa at all

I suppose it is almost an open secret that its into the mountains he
goes said Sacconi He has hardly taken the trouble to deny that he
is still in relations with the smugglers he got to know in the Savigno
affair and its quite natural he should take advantage of their
friendship to get his leaflets across the Papal frontier

For my part said Riccardo what I wanted to talk to you about is
this very question It occurred to me that we could hardly do better
than ask Rivarez to undertake the management of our own smuggling That
press at Pistoja is very inefficiently managed to my thinking and the
way the leaflets are taken across always rolled in those everlasting
cigars is more than primitive

It has answered pretty well up till now said Martini contumaciously
He was getting wearied of hearing Galli and Riccardo always put the
Gadfly forward as a model to copy and inclined to think that the world
had gone well enough before this lackadaisical buccaneer turned up to
set everyone to rights

It has answered so far well that we have been satisfied with it for
want of anything better but you know there have been plenty of arrests
and confiscations Now I believe that if Rivarez undertook the business
for us there would be less of that

Why do you think so

In the first place the smugglers look upon us as strangers to do
business with or as sheep to fleece whereas Rivarez is their personal
friend very likely their leader whom they look up to and trust You
may be sure every smuggler in the Apennines will do for a man who was
in the Savigno revolt what he will not do for us In the next place
theres hardly a man among us that knows the mountains as Rivarez does
Remember he has been a fugitive among them and knows the smugglers
paths by heart No smuggler would dare to cheat him even if he wished
to and no smuggler could cheat him if he dared to try

Then is your proposal that we should ask him to take over the
whole management of our literature on the other side of the
frontierdistribution addresses hidingplaces everythingor simply
that we should ask him to put the things across for us

Well as for addresses and hidingplaces he probably knows already
all the ones that we have and a good many more that we have not I
dont suppose we should be able to teach him much in that line As
for distribution its as the others prefer of course The important
question to my mind is the actual smuggling itself Once the books are
safe in Bologna its a comparatively simple matter to circulate them

For my part said Martini I am against the plan In the first place
all this about his skilfulness is mere conjecture we have not actually
seen him engaged in frontier work and do not know whether he keeps his
head in critical moments

Oh you neednt have any doubt of that Riccardo put in The history
of the Savigno affair proves that he keeps his head

And then Martini went on I do not feel at all inclined from what
little I know of Rivarez to intrust him with all the partys secrets
He seems to me featherbrained and theatrical To give the whole
management of a partys contraband work into a mans hands is a serious
matter Fabrizi what do you think

If I had only such objections as yours Martini replied the
professor I should certainly waive them in the case of a man really
possessing as Rivarez undoubtedly does all the qualifications Riccardo
speaks of For my part I have not the slightest doubt as to either his
courage his honesty or his presence of mind and that he knows both
mountains and mountaineers we have had ample proof But there is another
objection I do not feel sure that it is only for the smuggling of
pamphlets he goes into the mountains I have begun to doubt whether he
has not another purpose This is of course entirely between ourselves
It is a mere suspicion It seems to me just possible that he is in
connexion with some one of the sects and perhaps with the most
dangerous of them

Which one do you meanthe Red Girdles

No the Occoltellatori

The Knifers But that is a little body of outlawspeasants most of
them with neither education nor political experience

So were the insurgents of Savigno but they had a few educated men as
leaders and this little society may have the same And remember its
pretty well known that most of the members of those more violent sects
in the Romagna are survivors of the Savigno affair who found themselves
too weak to fight the Churchmen in open insurrection and so have fallen
back on assassination Their hands are not strong enough for guns and
they take to knives instead

But what makes you suppose Rivarez to be connected with them

I dont suppose I merely suspect In any case I think we had better
find out for certain before we intrust our smuggling to him If he
attempted to do both kinds of work at once he would injure our party
most terribly he would simply destroy its reputation and accomplish
nothing However we will talk of that another time I wanted to speak
to you about the news from Rome It is said that a commission is to be
appointed to draw up a project for a municipal constitution



CHAPTER VI

GEMMA and the Gadfly walked silently along the LungArno His feverish
talkativeness seemed to have quite spent itself he had hardly spoken a
word since they left Riccardos door and Gemma was heartily glad of his
silence She always felt embarrassed in his company and today more
so than usual for his strange behaviour at the committee meeting had
greatly perplexed her

By the Uffizi palace he suddenly stopped and turned to her

Are you tired

No why

Nor especially busy this evening

No

I want to ask a favour of you I want you to come for a walk with me

Where to

Nowhere in particular anywhere you like

But what for

He hesitated

Icant tell youat least its very difficult but please come if
you can

He raised his eyes suddenly from the ground and she saw how strange
their expression was

There is something the matter with you she said gently He pulled a
leaf from the flower in his buttonhole and began tearing it to pieces
Who was it that he was so oddly like Someone who had that same trick of
the fingers and hurried nervous gesture

I am in trouble he said looking down at his hands and speaking in a
hardly audible voice Idont want to be alone this evening Will you
come

Yes certainly unless you would rather go to my lodgings

No come and dine with me at a restaurant Theres one on the Signoria
Please dont refuse now youve promised

They went into a restaurant where he ordered dinner but hardly touched
his own share and remained obstinately silent crumbling the bread over
the cloth and fidgeting with the fringe of his table napkin Gemma felt
thoroughly uncomfortable and began to wish she had refused to come the
silence was growing awkward yet she could not begin to make smalltalk
with a person who seemed to have forgotten her presence At last he
looked up and said abruptly

Would you like to see the variety show

She stared at him in astonishment What had he got into his head about
variety shows

Have you ever seen one he asked before she had time to speak

No I dont think so I didnt suppose they were interesting

They are very interesting I dont think anyone can study the life of
the people without seeing them Let us go back to the Porta alla Croce

When they arrived the mountebanks had set up their tent beside the
town gate and an abominable scraping of fiddles and banging of drums
announced that the performance had begun

The entertainment was of the roughest kind A few clowns harlequins
and acrobats a circusrider jumping through hoops the painted
columbine and the hunchback performing various dull and foolish antics
represented the entire force of the company The jokes were not on the
whole coarse or offensive but they were very tame and stale and there
was a depressing flatness about the whole thing The audience laughed
and clapped from their innate Tuscan courtesy but the only part which
they seemed really to enjoy was the performance of the hunchback in
which Gemma could find nothing either witty or skilful It was merely
a series of grotesque and hideous contortions which the spectators
mimicked holding up children on their shoulders that the little ones
might see the ugly man

Signor Rivarez do you really think this attractive said Gemma
turning to the Gadfly who was standing beside her his arm round one of
the wooden posts of the tent It seems to me

She broke off and remained looking at him silently Except when she had
stood with Montanelli at the garden gate in Leghorn she had never seen
a human face express such fathomless hopeless misery She thought of
Dantes hell as she watched him

Presently the hunchback receiving a kick from one of the clowns
turned a somersault and tumbled in a grotesque heap outside the ring A
dialogue between two clowns began and the Gadfly seemed to wake out of
a dream

Shall we go he asked or would you like to see more

I would rather go

They left the tent and walked across the dark green to the river For a
few moments neither spoke

What did you think of the show the Gadfly asked presently

I thought it rather a dreary business and part of it seemed to me
positively unpleasant

Which part

Well all those grimaces and contortions They are simply ugly there
is nothing clever about them

Do you mean the hunchbacks performance

Remembering his peculiar sensitiveness on the subject of his own
physical defects she had avoided mentioning this particular bit of the
entertainment but now that he had touched upon the subject himself she
answered Yes I did not like that part at all

That was the part the people enjoyed most

I dare say and that is just the worst thing about it

Because it was inartistic

Nno it was all inartistic I meantbecause it was cruel

He smiled

Cruel Do you mean to the hunchback

I mean Of course the man himself was quite indifferent no doubt
it is to him just a way of getting a living like the circusriders
way or the columbines But the thing makes one feel unhappy It is
humiliating it is the degradation of a human being

He probably is not any more degraded than he was to start with Most of
us are degraded in one way or another

Yes but thisI dare say you will think it an absurd prejudice but
a human body to me is a sacred thing I dont like to see it treated
irreverently and made hideous

And a human soul

He had stopped short and was standing with one hand on the stone
balustrade of the embankment looking straight at her

A soul she repeated stopping in her turn to look at him in wonder

He flung out both hands with a sudden passionate gesture

Has it never occurred to you that that miserable clown may have a
soula living struggling human soul tied down into that crooked hulk
of a body and forced to slave for it You that are so tenderhearted to
everythingyou that pity the body in its fools dress and bellshave
you never thought of the wretched soul that has not even motley to cover
its horrible nakedness Think of it shivering with cold stilled with
shame and misery before all those peoplefeeling their jeers that cut
like a whiptheir laughter that burns like redhot iron on the bare
flesh Think of it looking roundso helpless before them allfor the
mountains that will not fall on itfor the rocks that have not the
heart to cover itenvying the rats that can creep into some hole in the
earth and hide and remember that a soul is dumbit has no voice to cry
outit must endure and endure and endure Oh Im talking nonsense
Why on earth dont you laugh You have no sense of humour

Slowly and in dead silence she turned and walked on along the river
side During the whole evening it had not once occurred to her to
connect his trouble whatever it might be with the variety show and
now that some dim picture of his inner life had been revealed to her by
this sudden outburst she could not find in her overwhelming pity for
him one word to say He walked on beside her with his head turned
away and looked into the water

I want you please to understand he began suddenly turning to her
with a defiant air that everything I have just been saying to you is
pure imagination Im rather given to romancing but I dont like people
to take it seriously

She made no answer and they walked on in silence As they passed by the
gateway of the Uffizi he crossed the road and stooped down over a dark
bundle that was lying against the railings

What is the matter little one he asked more gently than she had
ever heard him speak Why dont you go home

The bundle moved and answered something in a low moaning voice Gemma
came across to look and saw a child of about six years old ragged and
dirty crouching on the pavement like a frightened animal The Gadfly
was bending down with his hand on the unkempt head

What is it he said stooping lower to catch the unintelligible
answer You ought to go home to bed little boys have no business out
of doors at night youll be quite frozen Give me your hand and jump up
like a man Where do you live

He took the childs arm to raise him The result was a sharp scream and
a quick shrinking away

Why what is it the Gadfly asked kneeling down on the pavement Ah
Signora look here

The childs shoulder and jacket were covered with blood

Tell me what has happened the Gadfly went on caressingly It wasnt
a fall was it No Someones been beating you I thought so Who was
it

My uncle

Ah yes And when was it

This morning He was drunk and II

And you got in his waywas that it You shouldnt get in peoples way
when they are drunk little man they dont like it What shall we do
with this poor mite signora Come here to the light sonny and let
me look at that shoulder Put your arm round my neck I wont hurt you
There we are

He lifted the boy in his arms and carrying him across the street set
him down on the wide stone balustrade Then taking out a pocketknife
he deftly ripped up the torn sleeve supporting the childs head against
his breast while Gemma held the injured arm The shoulder was badly
bruised and grazed and there was a deep gash on the arm

Thats an ugly cut to give a mite like you said the Gadfly fastening
his handkerchief round the wound to prevent the jacket from rubbing
against it What did he do it with

The shovel I went to ask him to give me a soldo to get some polenta at
the corner shop and he hit me with the shovel

The Gadfly shuddered Ah he said softly that hurts doesnt it
little one

He hit me with the shoveland I ran awayI ran awaybecause he hit
me

And youve been wandering about ever since without any dinner

Instead of answering the child began to sob violently The Gadfly
lifted him off the balustrade

There there Well soon set all that straight I wonder if we can
get a cab anywhere Im afraid theyll all be waiting by the theatre
theres a grand performance going on tonight I am sorry to drag you
about so signora but

I would rather come with you You may want help Do you think you can
carry him so far Isnt he very heavy

Oh I can manage thank you

At the theatre door they found only a few cabs waiting and these were
all engaged The performance was over and most of the audience had
gone Zitas name was printed in large letters on the wallplacards she
had been dancing in the ballet Asking Gemma to wait for him a moment
the Gadfly went round to the performers entrance and spoke to an
attendant

Has Mme Reni gone yet

No sir the man answered staring blankly at the spectacle of a
welldressed gentleman carrying a ragged street child in his arms Mme
Reni is just coming out I think her carriage is waiting for her Yes
there she comes

Zita descended the stairs leaning on the arm of a young cavalry
officer She looked superbly handsome with an opera cloak of
flamecoloured velvet thrown over her evening dress and a great fan of
ostrich plumes hanging from her waist In the entry she stopped short
and drawing her hand away from the officers arm approached the Gadfly
in amazement

Felice she exclaimed under her breath what HAVE you got there

I have picked up this child in the street It is hurt and starving and
I want to get it home as quickly as possible There is not a cab to be
got anywhere so I want to have your carriage

Felice you are not going to take a horrid beggarchild into your
rooms Send for a policeman and let him carry it to the Refuge or
whatever is the proper place for it You cant have all the paupers in
the town

It is hurt the Gadfly repeated it can go to the Refuge tomorrow
if necessary but I must see to the child first and give it some food

Zita made a little grimace of disgust Youve got its head right
against your shirt How CAN you It is dirty

The Gadfly looked up with a sudden flash of anger

It is hungry he said fiercely You dont know what that means do
you

Signor Rivarez interposed Gemma coming forward my lodgings are
quite close Let us take the child in there Then if you cannot find a
vettura I will manage to put it up for the night

He turned round quickly You dont mind

Of course not Goodnight Mme Reni

The gipsy with a stiff bow and an angry shrug of her shoulders took
her officers arm again and gathering up the train of her dress swept
past them to the contested carriage

I will send it back to fetch you and the child if you like M
Rivarez she said pausing on the doorstep

Very well I will give the address He came out on to the pavement
gave the address to the driver and walked back to Gemma with his
burden

Katie was waiting up for her mistress and on hearing what had
happened ran for warm water and other necessaries Placing the child on
a chair the Gadfly knelt down beside him and deftly slipping off
the ragged clothing bathed and bandaged the wound with tender skilful
hands He had just finished washing the boy and was wrapping him in a
warm blanket when Gemma came in with a tray in her hands

Is your patient ready for his supper she asked smiling at the
strange little figure I have been cooking it for him

The Gadfly stood up and rolled the dirty rags together Im afraid we
have made a terrible mess in your room he said As for these they
had better go straight into the fire and I will buy him some new
clothes tomorrow Have you any brandy in the house signora I think
he ought to have a little I will just wash my hands if you will allow
me

When the child had finished his supper he immediately went to sleep in
the Gadflys arms with his rough head against the white shirtfront
Gemma who had been helping Katie to set the disordered room tidy again
sat down at the table

Signor Rivarez you must take something before you go homeyou had
hardly any dinner and its very late

I should like a cup of tea in the English fashion if you have it Im
sorry to keep you up so late

Oh that doesnt matter Put the child down on the sofa he will tire
you Wait a minute I will just lay a sheet over the cushions What are
you going to do with him

Tomorrow Find out whether he has any other relations except that
drunken brute and if not I suppose I must follow Mme Renis advice
and take him to the Refuge Perhaps the kindest thing to do would be to
put a stone round his neck and pitch him into the river there but that
would expose me to unpleasant consequences Fast asleep What an odd
little lump of illluck you are you mitenot half as capable of
defending yourself as a stray cat

When Katie brought in the teatray the boy opened his eyes and sat up
with a bewildered air Recognizing the Gadfly whom he already regarded
as his natural protector he wriggled off the sofa and much encumbered
by the folds of his blanket came up to nestle against him He was
by now sufficiently revived to be inquisitive and pointing to the
mutilated left hand in which the Gadfly was holding a piece of cake
asked

Whats that

That Cake do you want some I think youve had enough for now Wait
till tomorrow little man

Nothat He stretched out his hand and touched the stumps of the
amputated fingers and the great scar on the wrist The Gadfly put down
his cake

Oh that Its the same sort of thing as what you have on your
shouldera hit I got from someone stronger than I was

Didnt it hurt awfully

Oh I dont knownot more than other things There now go to sleep
again you have no business asking questions at this time of night

When the carriage arrived the boy was again asleep and the Gadfly
without awaking him lifted him gently and carried him out on to the
stairs

You have been a sort of ministering angel to me today he said to
Gemma pausing at the door But I suppose that need not prevent us from
quarrelling to our hearts content in future

I have no desire to quarrel with anyone

Ah but I have Life would be unendurable without quarrels A good
quarrel is the salt of the earth its better than a variety show

And with that he went downstairs laughing softly to himself with the
sleeping child in his arms



CHAPTER VII

ONE day in the first week of January Martini who had sent round
the forms of invitation to the monthly groupmeeting of the literary
committee received from the Gadfly a laconic pencilscrawled Very
sorry cant come He was a little annoyed as a notice of important
business had been put into the invitation this cavalier treatment
seemed to him almost insolent Moreover three separate letters
containing bad news arrived during the day and the wind was in the
east so that Martini felt out of sorts and out of temper and when at
the group meeting Dr Riccardo asked Isnt Rivarez here he answered
rather sulkily No he seems to have got something more interesting on
hand and cant come or doesnt want to

Really Martini said Galli irritably you are about the most
prejudiced person in Florence Once you object to a man everything he
does is wrong How could Rivarez come when hes ill

Who told you he was ill

Didnt you know Hes been laid up for the last four days

Whats the matter with him

I dont know He had to put off an appointment with me on Thursday on
account of illness and last night when I went round I heard that he
was too ill to see anyone I thought Riccardo would be looking after
him

I knew nothing about it Ill go round tonight and see if he wants
anything

The next morning Riccardo looking very pale and tired came into
Gemmas little study She was sitting at the table reading out
monotonous strings of figures to Martini who with a magnifying glass
in one hand and a finely pointed pencil in the other was making
tiny marks in the pages of a book She made with one hand a gesture
requesting silence Riccardo knowing that a person who is writing in
cipher must not be interrupted sat down on the sofa behind her and
yawned like a man who can hardly keep awake

2 4 3 7 6 1 3 5 4 1 Gemmas voice went on with machinelike
evenness 8 4 7 2 5 1 that finishes the sentence Cesare

She stuck a pin into the paper to mark the exact place and turned
round

Goodmorning doctor how fagged you look Are you well

Oh Im well enoughonly tired out Ive had an awful night with
Rivarez

With Rivarez

Yes Ive been up with him all night and now I must go off to my
hospital patients I just came round to know whether you can think of
anyone that could look after him a bit for the next few days Hes in a
devil of a state Ill do my best of course but I really havent the
time and he wont hear of my sending in a nurse

What is the matter with him

Well rather a complication of things First of all

First of all have you had any breakfast

Yes thank you About Rivarezno doubt its complicated with a lot of
nerve trouble but the main cause of disturbance is an old injury
that seems to have been disgracefully neglected Altogether hes in
a frightfully knockedabout state I suppose it was that war in South
Americaand he certainly didnt get proper care when the mischief was
done Probably things were managed in a very roughandready fashion
out there hes lucky to be alive at all However theres a chronic
tendency to inflammation and any trifle may bring on an attack

Is that dangerous

Nno the chief danger in a case of that kind is of the patient getting
desperate and taking a dose of arsenic

It is very painful of course

Its simply horrible I dont know how he manages to bear it I was
obliged to stupefy him with opium in the nighta thing I hate to do
with a nervous patient but I had to stop it somehow

He is nervous I should think

Very but splendidly plucky As long as he was not actually
lightheaded with the pain last night his coolness was quite wonderful
But I had an awful job with him towards the end How long do you suppose
this thing has been going on Just five nights and not a soul within
call except that stupid landlady who wouldnt wake if the house tumbled
down and would be no use if she did

But what about the balletgirl

Yes isnt that a curious thing He wont let her come near him He
has a morbid horror of her Altogether hes one of the most
incomprehensible creatures I ever meta perfect mass of
contradictions

He took out his watch and looked at it with a preoccupied face I shall
be late at the hospital but it cant be helped The junior will have
to begin without me for once I wish I had known of all this beforeit
ought not to have been let go on that way night after night

But why on earth didnt he send to say he was ill Martini
interrupted He might have guessed we shouldnt have left him stranded
in that fashion

I wish doctor said Gemma that you had sent for one of us last
night instead of wearing yourself out like this

My dear lady I wanted to send round to Galli but Rivarez got so
frantic at the suggestion that I didnt dare attempt it When I asked
him whether there was anyone else he would like fetched he looked at me
for a minute as if he were scared out of his wits and then put up
both hands to his eyes and said Dont tell them they will laugh
He seemed quite possessed with some fancy about people laughing at
something I couldnt make out what he kept talking Spanish but
patients do say the oddest things sometimes

Who is with him now asked Gemma

No one except the landlady and her maid

Ill go to him at once said Martini

Thank you Ill look round again in the evening Youll find a paper
of written directions in the tabledrawer by the large window and the
opium is on the shelf in the next room If the pain comes on again give
him another dosenot more than one but dont leave the bottle where he
can get at it whatever you do he might be tempted to take too much

When Martini entered the darkened room the Gadfly turned his head
round quickly and holding out to him a burning hand began in a bad
imitation of his usual flippant manner

Ah Martini You have come to rout me out about those proofs Its no
use swearing at me for missing the committee last night the fact is I
have not been quite well and

Never mind the committee I have just seen Riccardo and have come to
know if I can be of any use

The Gadfly set his face like a flint

Oh really that is very kind of you but it wasnt worth the trouble
Im only a little out of sorts

So I understood from Riccardo He was up with you all night I
believe

The Gadfly bit his lip savagely

I am quite comfortable thank you and dont want anything

Very well then I will sit in the other room perhaps you would rather
be alone I will leave the door ajar in case you call me

Please dont trouble about it I really shant want anything I should
be wasting your time for nothing

Nonsense man Martini broke in roughly Whats the use of trying
to fool me that way Do you think I have no eyes Lie still and go to
sleep if you can

He went into the adjoining room and leaving the door open sat down
with a book Presently he heard the Gadfly move restlessly two or three
times He put down his book and listened There was a short silence
then another restless movement then the quick heavy panting breath
of a man clenching his teeth to suppress a groan He went back into the
room

Can I do anything for you Rivarez

There was no answer and he crossed the room to the bedside The
Gadfly with a ghastly livid face looked at him for a moment and
silently shook his head

Shall I give you some more opium Riccardo said you were to have it if
the pain got very bad

No thank you I can bear it a bit longer It may be worse later on

Martini shrugged his shoulders and sat down beside the bed For an
interminable hour he watched in silence then he rose and fetched the
opium

Rivarez I wont let this go on any longer if you can stand it I
cant You must have the stuff

The Gadfly took it without speaking Then he turned away and closed
his eyes Martini sat down again and listened as the breathing became
gradually deep and even

The Gadfly was too much exhausted to wake easily when once asleep Hour
after hour he lay absolutely motionless Martini approached him several
times during the day and evening and looked at the still figure but
except the breathing there was no sign of life The face was so wan and
colourless that at last a sudden fear seized upon him what if he had
given too much opium The injured left arm lay on the coverlet and
he shook it gently to rouse the sleeper As he did so the unfastened
sleeve fell back showing a series of deep and fearful scars covering
the arm from wrist to elbow

That arm must have been in a pleasant condition when those marks were
fresh said Riccardos voice behind him

Ah there you are at last Look here Riccardo ought this man to sleep
forever I gave him a dose about ten hours ago and he hasnt moved a
muscle since

Riccardo stooped down and listened for a moment

No he is breathing quite properly its nothing but sheer
exhaustionwhat you might expect after such a night There may be
another paroxysm before morning Someone will sit up I hope

Galli will he has sent to say he will be here by ten

Its nearly that now Ah hes waking Just see the maidservant gets
that broth hot Gentlygently Rivarez There there you neednt
fight man Im not a bishop

The Gadfly started up with a shrinking scared look Is it my turn he
said hurriedly in Spanish Keep the people amused a minute I Ah I
didnt see you Riccardo

He looked round the room and drew one hand across his forehead as if
bewildered Martini Why I thought you had gone away I must have been
asleep

You have been sleeping like the beauty in the fairy story for the last
ten hours and now you are to have some broth and go to sleep again

Ten hours Martini surely you havent been here all that time

Yes I was beginning to wonder whether I hadnt given you an overdose
of opium

The Gadfly shot a sly glance at him

No such luck Wouldnt you have nice quiet committeemeetings What
the devil do you want Riccardo Do for mercys sake leave me in peace
cant you I hate being mauled about by doctors

Well then drink this and Ill leave you in peace I shall come round
in a day or two though and give you a thorough overhauling I think
you have pulled through the worst of this business now you dont look
quite so much like a deaths head at a feast

Oh I shall be all right soon thanks Whos thatGalli I seem to
have a collection of all the graces here tonight

I have come to stop the night with you

Nonsense I dont want anyone Go home all the lot of you Even if
the thing should come on again you cant help me I wont keep taking
opium Its all very well once in a way

Im afraid youre right Riccardo said But thats not always an easy
resolution to stick to

The Gadfly looked up smiling No fear If Id been going in for that
sort of thing I should have done it long ago

Anyway you are not going to be left alone Riccardo answered drily
Come into the other room a minute Galli I want to speak to you
Goodnight Rivarez Ill look in tomorrow

Martini was following them out of the room when he heard his name softly
called The Gadfly was holding out a hand to him

Thank you

Oh stuff Go to sleep

When Riccardo had gone Martini remained a few minutes in the outer
room talking with Galli As he opened the front door of the house he
heard a carriage stop at the garden gate and saw a womans figure get
out and come up the path It was Zita returning evidently from some
evening entertainment He lifted his hat and stood aside to let her
pass then went out into the dark lane leading from the house to the
Poggio Imperiale Presently the gate clicked and rapid footsteps came
down the lane

Wait a minute she said

When he turned back to meet her she stopped short and then came slowly
towards him dragging one hand after her along the hedge There was a
single streetlamp at the corner and he saw by its light that she was
hanging her head down as though embarrassed or ashamed

How is he she asked without looking up

Much better than he was this morning He has been asleep most of the
day and seems less exhausted I think the attack is passing over

She still kept her eyes on the ground

Has it been very bad this time

About as bad as it can well be I should think

I thought so When he wont let me come into the room that always
means its bad

Does he often have attacks like this

That depends Its so irregular Last summer in Switzerland he was
quite well but the winter before when we were in Vienna it was awful
He wouldnt let me come near him for days together He hates to have me
about when hes ill

She glanced up for a moment and dropping her eyes again went on

He always used to send me off to a ball or concert or something on
one pretext or another when he felt it coming on Then he would lock
himself into his room I used to slip back and sit outside the doorhe
would have been furious if hed known Hed let the dog come in if it
whined but not me He cares more for it I think

There was a curious sullen defiance in her manner

Well I hope it wont be so bad any more said Martini kindly Dr
Riccardo is taking the case seriously in hand Perhaps he will be able
to make a permanent improvement And in any case the treatment gives
relief at the moment But you had better send to us at once another
time He would have suffered very much less if we had known of it
earlier Goodnight

He held out his hand but she drew back with a quick gesture of refusal

I dont see why you want to shake hands with his mistress

As you like of course he began in embarrassment

She stamped her foot on the ground I hate you she cried turning on
him with eyes like glowing coals I hate you all You come here talking
politics to him and he lets you sit up the night with him and give him
things to stop the pain and I darent so much as peep at him through
the door What is he to you What right have you to come and steal him
away from me I hate you I hate you I HATE you

She burst into a violent fit of sobbing and darting back into the
garden slammed the gate in his face

Good Heavens said Martini to himself as he walked down the lane
That girl is actually in love with him Of all the extraordinary
things



CHAPTER VIII

THE Gadflys recovery was rapid One afternoon in the following week
Riccardo found him lying on the sofa in a Turkish dressinggown
chatting with Martini and Galli He even talked about going downstairs
but Riccardo merely laughed at the suggestion and asked whether he would
like a tramp across the valley to Fiesole to start with

You might go and call on the Grassinis for a change he added
wickedly Im sure madame would be delighted to see you especially
now when you look so pale and interesting

The Gadfly clasped his hands with a tragic gesture

Bless my soul I never thought of that Shed take me for one of
Italys martyrs and talk patriotism to me I should have to act up to
the part and tell her Ive been cut to pieces in an underground dungeon
and stuck together again rather badly and shed want to know exactly
what the process felt like You dont think shed believe it Riccardo
Ill bet you my Indian dagger against the bottled tapeworm in your
den that shell swallow the biggest lie I can invent Thats a generous
offer and youd better jump at it

Thanks Im not so fond of murderous tools as you are

Well a tapeworm is as murderous as a dagger any day and not half so
pretty

But as it happens my dear fellow I dont want the dagger and I do
want the tapeworm Martini I must run off Are you in charge of this
obstreperous patient

Only till three oclock Galli and I have to go to San Miniato and
Signora Bolla is coming till I can get back

Signora Bolla the Gadfly repeated in a tone of dismay Why
Martini this will never do I cant have a lady bothered over me and my
ailments Besides where is she to sit She wont like to come in here

Since when have you gone in so fiercely for the proprieties asked
Riccardo laughing My good man Signora Bolla is head nurse in general
to all of us She has looked after sick people ever since she was in
short frocks and does it better than any sister of mercy I know Wont
like to come into your room Why you might be talking of the Grassini
woman I neednt leave any directions if shes coming Martini Heart
alive its halfpast two I must be off

Now Rivarez take your physic before she comes said Galli
approaching the sofa with a medicine glass

Damn the physic The Gadfly had reached the irritable stage of
convalescence and was inclined to give his devoted nurses a bad time
Wwhat do you want to dddose me with all sorts of horrors for now the
pain is gone

Just because I dont want it to come back You wouldnt like it if you
collapsed when Signora Bolla is here and she had to give you opium

My ggood sir if that pain is going to come back it will come its
not a ttoothache to be frightened away with your trashy mixtures They
are about as much use as a ttoy squirt for a house on fire However I
suppose you must have your way

He took the glass with his left hand and the sight of the terrible
scars recalled Galli to the former subject of conversation

By the way he asked how did you get so much knocked about In the
war was it

Now didnt I just tell you it was a case of secret dungeons and

Yes that version is for Signora Grassinis benefit Really I suppose
it was in the war with Brazil

Yes I got a bit hurt there and then hunting in the savage districts
and one thing and another

Ah yes on the scientific expedition You can fasten your shirt I
have quite done You seem to have had an exciting time of it out there

Well of course you cant live in savage countries without getting a
few adventures once in a way said the Gadfly lightly and you can
hardly expect them all to be pleasant

Still I dont understand how you managed to get so much knocked about
unless in a bad adventure with wild beaststhose scars on your left
arm for instance

Ah that was in a pumahunt You see I had fired

There was a knock at the door

Is the room tidy Martini Yes Then please open the door This is
really most kind signora you must excuse my not getting up

Of course you mustnt get up I have not come as a caller I am a
little early Cesare I thought perhaps you were in a hurry to go

I can stop for a quarter of an hour Let me put your cloak in the other
room Shall I take the basket too

Take care those are newlaid eggs Katie brought them in from Monte
Oliveto this morning There are some Christmas roses for you Signor
Rivarez I know you are fond of flowers

She sat down beside the table and began clipping the stalks of the
flowers and arranging them in a vase

Well Rivarez said Galli tell us the rest of the pumahunt story
you had just begun

Ah yes Galli was asking me about life in South America signora and
I was telling him how I came to get my left arm spoiled It was in Peru
We had been wading a river on a pumahunt and when I fired at the beast
the powder wouldnt go off it had got splashed with water Naturally
the puma didnt wait for me to rectify that and this is the result

That must have been a pleasant experience

Oh not so bad One must take the rough with the smooth of course but
its a splendid life on the whole Serpentcatching for instance

He rattled on telling anecdote after anecdote now of the Argentine
war now of the Brazilian expedition now of hunting feats and
adventures with savages or wild beasts Galli with the delight of
a child hearing a fairy story kept interrupting every moment to ask
questions He was of the impressionable Neapolitan temperament and loved
everything sensational Gemma took some knitting from her basket and
listened silently with busy fingers and downcast eyes Martini frowned
and fidgeted The manner in which the anecdotes were told seemed to
him boastful and selfconscious and notwithstanding his unwilling
admiration for a man who could endure physical pain with the amazing
fortitude which he had seen the week before he genuinely disliked the
Gadfly and all his works and ways

It must have been a glorious life sighed Galli with naive envy I
wonder you ever made up your mind to leave Brazil Other countries must
seem so flat after it

I think I was happiest in Peru and Ecuador said the Gadfly That
really is a magnificent tract of country Of course it is very hot
especially the coast district of Ecuador and one has to rough it a bit
but the scenery is superb beyond imagination

I believe said Galli the perfect freedom of life in a barbarous
country would attract me more than any scenery A man must feel his
personal human dignity as he can never feel it in our crowded towns

Yes the Gadfly answered that is

Gemma raised her eyes from her knitting and looked at him He flushed
suddenly scarlet and broke off There was a little pause

Surely it is not come on again asked Galli anxiously

Oh nothing to speak of thanks to your sssoothing application that I
bbblasphemed against Are you going already Martini

Yes Come along Galli we shall be late

Gemma followed the two men out of the room and presently returned with
an egg beaten up in milk

Take this please she said with mild authority and sat down again to
her knitting The Gadfly obeyed meekly

For half an hour neither spoke Then the Gadfly said in a very low
voice

Signora Bolla

She looked up He was tearing the fringe of the couchrug and kept his
eyes lowered

You didnt believe I was speaking the truth just now he began

I had not the smallest doubt that you were telling falsehoods she
answered quietly

You were quite right I was telling falsehoods all the time

Do you mean about the war

About everything I was not in that war at all and as for the
expedition I had a few adventures of course and most of those stories
are true but it was not that way I got smashed You have detected me in
one lie so I may as well confess the lot I suppose

Does it not seem to you rather a waste of energy to invent so many
falsehoods she asked I should have thought it was hardly worth the
trouble

What would you have You know your own English proverb Ask no
questions and youll be told no lies Its no pleasure to me to fool
people that way but I must answer them somehow when they ask what made
a cripple of me and I may as well invent something pretty while Im
about it You saw how pleased Galli was

Do you prefer pleasing Galli to speaking the truth

The truth He looked up with the torn fringe in his hand You
wouldnt have me tell those people the truth Id cut my tongue out
first Then with an awkward shy abruptness

I have never told it to anybody yet but Ill tell you if you care to
hear

She silently laid down her knitting To her there was something
grievously pathetic in this hard secret unlovable creature suddenly
flinging his personal confidence at the feet of a woman whom he barely
knew and whom he apparently disliked

A long silence followed and she looked up He was leaning his left arm
on the little table beside him and shading his eyes with the mutilated
hand and she noticed the nervous tension of the fingers and the
throbbing of the scar on the wrist She came up to him and called him
softly by name He started violently and raised his head

I fforgot he stammered apologetically I was ggoing to ttell you
about

About theaccident or whatever it was that caused your lameness But
if it worries you

The accident Oh the smashing Yes only it wasnt an accident it was
a poker

She stared at him in blank amazement He pushed back his hair with a
hand that shook perceptibly and looked up at her smiling

Wont you sit down Bring your chair close please Im so sorry I
cant get it for you Rreally now I come to think of it the case
would have been a pperfect ttreasuretrove for Riccardo if he had
had me to treat he has the true surgeons love for broken bones and
I believe everything in me that was breakable was broken on that
occasionexcept my neck

And your courage she put in softly But perhaps you count that among
your unbreakable possessions

He shook his head No he said my courage has been mended up after
a fashion with the rest of me but it was fairly broken then like a
smashed teacup thats the horrible part of it Ah Yes well I was
telling you about the poker

It waslet me seenearly thirteen years ago in Lima I told you
Peru was a delightful country to live in but its not quite so nice for
people that happen to be at low water as I was I had been down in the
Argentine and then in Chili tramping the country and starving mostly
and had come up from Valparaiso as oddman on a cattleboat I couldnt
get any work in Lima itself so I went down to the dockstheyre
at Callao you knowto try there Well of course in all those
shippingports there are low quarters where the seafaring people
congregate and after some time I got taken on as servant in one of the
gambling hells there I had to do the cooking and billiardmarking and
fetch drink for the sailors and their women and all that sort of thing
Not very pleasant work still I was glad to get it there was at least
food and the sight of human faces and sound of human tonguesof a
kind You may think that was no advantage but I had just been down with
yellow fever alone in the outhouse of a wretched halfcaste shanty and
the thing had given me the horrors Well one night I was told to put
out a tipsy Lascar who was making himself obnoxious he had come ashore
and lost all his money and was in a bad temper Of course I had to obey
if I didnt want to lose my place and starve but the man was twice as
strong as II was not twentyone and as weak as a cat after the fever
Besides he had the poker

He paused a moment glancing furtively at her then went on

Apparently he intended to put an end to me altogether but somehow he
managed to scamp his workLascars always do if they have a chance and
left just enough of me not smashed to go on living with

Yes but the other people could they not interfere Were they all
afraid of one Lascar

He looked up and burst out laughing

THE OTHER PEOPLE The gamblers and the people of the house Why you
dont understand They were negroes and Chinese and Heaven knows what
and I was their servantTHEIR PROPERTY They stood round and enjoyed
the fun of course That sort of thing counts for a good joke out there
So it is if you dont happen to be the subject practised on

She shuddered

Then what was the end of it

That I cant tell you much about a man doesnt remember the next
few days after a thing of that kind as a rule But there was a ships
surgeon near and it seems that when they found I was not dead somebody
called him in He patched me up after a fashionRiccardo seems to think
it was rather badly done but that may be professional jealousy Anyhow
when I came to my senses an old native woman had taken me in for
Christian charitythat sounds queer doesnt it She used to sit
huddled up in the corner of the hut smoking a black pipe and spitting
on the floor and crooning to herself However she meant well and
she told me I might die in peace and nobody should disturb me But the
spirit of contradiction was strong in me and I elected to live It
was rather a difficult job scrambling back to life and sometimes I
am inclined to think it was a great deal of cry for very little wool
Anyway that old womans patience was wonderful she kept mehow long
was itnearly four months lying in her hut raving like a mad thing at
intervals and as vicious as a bear with a sore ear betweenwhiles
The pain was pretty bad you see and my temper had been spoiled in
childhood with overmuch coddling

And then

Oh thenI got up somehow and crawled away No dont think it was
any delicacy about taking a poor womans charityI was past caring for
that it was only that I couldnt bear the place any longer You talked
just now about my courage if you had seen me then The worst of the
pain used to come on every evening about dusk and in the afternoon
I used to lie alone and watch the sun get lower and lower Oh you
cant understand It makes me sick to look at a sunset now

A long pause

Well then I went up country to see if I could get work anywhereit
would have driven me mad to stay in Lima I got as far as Cuzco and
there Really I dont know why Im inflicting all this ancient
history on you it hasnt even the merit of being funny

She raised her head and looked at him with deep and serious eyes
PLEASE dont talk that way she said

He bit his lip and tore off another piece of the rugfringe

Shall I go on he asked after a moment

Ifif you will I am afraid it is horrible to you to remember

Do you think I forget when I hold my tongue Its worse then But
dont imagine its the thing itself that haunts me so It is the fact of
having lost the power over myself

Idont think I quite understand

I mean it is the fact of having come to the end of my courage to the
point where I found myself a coward

Surely there is a limit to what anyone can bear

Yes and the man who has once reached that limit never knows when he
may reach it again

Would you mind telling me she asked hesitating how you came to be
stranded out there alone at twenty

Very simply I had a good opening in life at home in the old country
and ran away from it

Why

He laughed again in his quick harsh way

Why Because I was a priggish young cub I suppose I had been brought
up in an overluxurious home and coddled and faddled after till I
thought the world was made of pink cottonwool and sugared almonds Then
one fine day I found out that someone I had trusted had deceived me
Why how you start What is it

Nothing Go on please

I found out that I had been tricked into believing a lie a common bit
of experience of course but as I tell you I was young and priggish
and thought that liars go to hell So I ran away from home and plunged
into South America to sink or swim as I could without a cent in my
pocket or a word of Spanish in my tongue or anything but white hands
and expensive habits to get my bread with And the natural result was
that I got a dip into the real hell to cure me of imagining sham ones
A pretty thorough dip tooit was just five years before the Duprez
expedition came along and pulled me out

Five years Oh that is terrible And had you no friends

Friends Ihe turned on her with sudden fiercenessI have NEVER had
a friend

The next instant he seemed a little ashamed of his vehemence and went
on quickly

You mustnt take all this too seriously I dare say I made the worst
of things and really it wasnt so bad the first year and a half I was
young and strong and I managed to scramble along fairly well till the
Lascar put his mark on me But after that I couldnt get work Its
wonderful what an effectual tool a poker is if you handle it properly
and nobody cares to employ a cripple

What sort of work did you do

What I could get For some time I lived by oddjobbing for the blacks
on the sugar plantations fetching and carrying and so on Its one of
the curious things in life by the way that slaves always contrive to
have a slave of their own and theres nothing a negro likes so much as
a white fag to bully But it was no use the overseers always turned me
off I was too lame to be quick and I couldnt manage the heavy loads
And then I was always getting these attacks of inflammation or whatever
the confounded thing is

After some time I went down to the silvermines and tried to get work
there but it was all no good The managers laughed at the very notion
of taking me on and as for the men they made a dead set at me

Why was that

Oh human nature I suppose they saw I had only one hand that I could
hit back with Theyre a mangy halfcaste lot negroes and Zambos
mostly And then those horrible coolies So at last I got enough of
that and set off to tramp the country at random just wandering about
on the chance of something turning up

To tramp With that lame foot

He looked up with a sudden piteous catching of the breath

II was hungry he said

She turned her head a little away and rested her chin on one hand After
a moments silence he began again his voice sinking lower and lower as
he spoke

Well I tramped and tramped till I was nearly mad with tramping and
nothing came of it I got down into Ecuador and there it was worse than
ever Sometimes Id get a bit of tinkering to doIm a pretty fair
tinkeror an errand to run or a pigstye to clean out sometimes I
didoh I hardly know what And then at last one day

The slender brown hand clenched itself suddenly on the table and
Gemma raising her head glanced at him anxiously His sideface was
turned towards her and she could see a vein on the temple beating like
a hammer with quick irregular strokes She bent forward and laid a
gentle hand on his arm

Never mind the rest its almost too horrible to talk about

He stared doubtfully at the hand shook his head and went on steadily

Then one day I met a travelling variety show You remember that one the
other night well that sort of thing only coarser and more indecent
The Zambos are not like these gentle Florentines they dont care for
anything that is not foul or brutal There was bullfighting too of
course They had camped out by the roadside for the night and I went up
to their tent to beg Well the weather was hot and I was half starved
and soI fainted at the door of the tent I had a trick of fainting
suddenly at that time like a boardingschool girl with tight stays So
they took me in and gave me brandy and food and so on and thenthe
next morningthey offered me

Another pause

They wanted a hunchback or monstrosity of some kind for the boys
to pelt with orangepeel and bananaskinssomething to set the blacks
laughing You saw the clown that nightwell I was thatfor
two years I suppose you have a humanitarian feeling about negroes and
Chinese Wait till youve been at their mercy

Well I learned to do the tricks I was not quite deformed enough but
they set that right with an artificial hump and made the most of
this foot and arm And the Zambos are not critical theyre easily
satisfied if only they can get hold of some live thing to torturethe
fools dress makes a good deal of difference too

The only difficulty was that I was so often ill and unable to play
Sometimes if the manager was out of temper he would insist on my
coming into the ring when I had these attacks on and I believe the
people liked those evenings best Once I remember I fainted right off
with the pain in the middle of the performance When I came to my
senses again the audience had got round mehooting and yelling and
pelting me with

Dont I cant hear any more Stop for Gods sake

She was standing up with both hands over her ears He broke off and
looking up saw the glitter of tears in her eyes

Damn it all what an idiot I am he said under his breath

She crossed the room and stood for a little while looking out of the
window When she turned round the Gadfly was again leaning on the table
and covering his eyes with one hand He had evidently forgotten her
presence and she sat down beside him without speaking After a long
silence she said slowly

I want to ask you a question

Yes without moving

Why did you not cut your throat

He looked up in grave surprise I did not expect YOU to ask that he
said And what about my work Who would have done it for me

Your work Ah I see You talked just now about being a coward
well if you have come through that and kept to your purpose you are
the very bravest man that I have ever met

He covered his eyes again and held her hand in a close passionate
clasp A silence that seemed to have no end fell around them

Suddenly a clear and fresh soprano voice rang out from the garden below
singing a verse of a doggerel French song


 Eh Pierrot Danse Pierrot
 Danse un peu mon pauvre Jeannot
 Vive la danse et lallegresse
 Jouissons de notre bell jeunesse
 Si moi je pleure ou moi je soupire
 Si moi je fais la triste figure
 Monsieur ce nest que pour rire
 Ha Ha ha ha
 Monsieur ce nest que pour rire


At the first words the Gadfly tore his hand from Gemmas and shrank away
with a stifled groan She clasped both hands round his arm and pressed
it firmly as she might have pressed that of a person undergoing a
surgical operation When the song broke off and a chorus of laughter and
applause came from the garden he looked up with the eyes of a tortured
animal

Yes it is Zita he said slowly with her officer friends She tried
to come in here the other night before Riccardo came I should have
gone mad if she had touched me

But she does not know Gemma protested softly She cannot guess that
she is hurting you

She is like a Creole he answered shuddering Do you remember her
face that night when we brought in the beggarchild That is how the
halfcastes look when they laugh

Another burst of laughter came from the garden Gemma rose and opened
the window Zita with a goldembroidered scarf wound coquettishly
round her head was standing in the garden path holding up a bunch
of violets for the possession of which three young cavalry officers
appeared to be competing

Mme Reni said Gemma

Zitas face darkened like a thundercloud Madame she said turning
and raising her eyes with a defiant look

Would your friends mind speaking a little more softly Signor Rivarez
is very unwell

The gipsy flung down her violets Allezvous en she said turning
sharply on the astonished officers Vous membetez messieurs

She went slowly out into the road Gemma closed the window

They have gone away she said turning to him

Thank you II am sorry to have troubled you

It was no trouble He at once detected the hesitation in her voice

But he said That sentence was not finished signora there was an
unspoken but in the back of your mind

If you look into the backs of peoples minds you mustnt be offended
at what you read there It is not my affair of course but I cannot
understand

My aversion to Mme Reni It is only when

No your caring to live with her when you feel that aversion It seems
to me an insult to her as a woman and as

A woman He burst out laughing harshly Is THAT what you call a
woman Madame ce nest que pour rire

That is not fair she said You have no right to speak of her in that
way to anyoneespecially to another woman

He turned away and lay with wideopen eyes looking out of the window
at the sinking sun She lowered the blind and closed the shutters that
he might not see it set then sat down at the table by the other window
and took up her knitting again

Would you like the lamp she asked after a moment

He shook his head

When it grew too dark to see Gemma rolled up her knitting and laid
it in the basket For some time she sat with folded hands silently
watching the Gadflys motionless figure The dim evening light falling
on his face seemed to soften away its hard mocking selfassertive
look and to deepen the tragic lines about the mouth By some fanciful
association of ideas her memory went vividly back to the stone cross
which her father had set up in memory of Arthur and to its inscription


 All thy waves and billows have gone over me


An hour passed in unbroken silence At last she rose and went softly out
of the room Coming back with a lamp she paused for a moment thinking
that the Gadfly was asleep As the light fell on his face he turned
round

I have made you a cup of coffee she said setting down the lamp

Put it down a minute Will you come here please

He took both her hands in his

I have been thinking he said You are quite right it is an ugly
tangle I have got my life into But remember a man does not meet every
day a woman whom he canlove and II have been in deep waters I am
afraid

Afraid

Of the dark Sometimes I DARE not be alone at night I must have
something livingsomething solid beside me It is the outer darkness
where shall be No no Its not that thats a sixpenny toy
hellits the INNER darkness Theres no weeping or gnashing of teeth
there only silencesilence

His eyes dilated She was quite still hardly breathing till he spoke
again

This is all mystification to you isnt it You cant
understandluckily for you What I mean is that I have a pretty fair
chance of going mad if I try to live quite alone Dont think too
hardly of me if you can help it I am not altogether the vicious brute
you perhaps imagine me to be

I cannot try to judge for you she answered I have not suffered as
you have ButI have been in rather deep water too in another way and
I thinkI am surethat if you let the fear of anything drive you to
do a really cruel or unjust or ungenerous thing you will regret it
afterwards For the restif you have failed in this one thing I know
that I in your place should have failed altogethershould have
cursed God and died

He still kept her hands in his

Tell me he said very softly have you ever in your life done a
really cruel thing

She did not answer but her head sank down and two great tears fell on
his hand

Tell me he whispered passionately clasping her hands tighter Tell
me I have told you all my misery

Yesoncelong ago And I did it to the person I loved best in the
world

The hands that clasped hers were trembling violently but they did not
loosen their hold

He was a comrade she went on and I believed a slander against
hima common glaring lie that the police had invented I struck him in
the face for a traitor and he went away and drowned himself Then two
days later I found out that he had been quite innocent Perhaps that is
a worse memory than any of yours I would cut off my right hand to undo
what it has done

Something swift and dangeroussomething that she had not seen
beforeflashed into his eyes He bent his head down with a furtive
sudden gesture and kissed the hand

She drew back with a startled face Dont she cried out piteously
Please dont ever do that again You hurt me

Do you think you didnt hurt the man you killed

The man Ikilled Ah there is Cesare at the gate at last II
must go

 

When Martini came into the room he found the Gadfly lying alone with the
untouched coffee beside him swearing softly to himself in a languid
spiritless way as though he got no satisfaction out of it



CHAPTER IX

A FEW days later the Gadfly still rather pale and limping more than
usual entered the reading room of the public library and asked for
Cardinal Montanellis sermons Riccardo who was reading at a table near
him looked up He liked the Gadfly very much but could not digest this
one trait in himthis curious personal maliciousness

Are you preparing another volley against that unlucky Cardinal he
asked half irritably

My dear fellow why do you aaalways attribute evil mmmotives to
people Its mmost unchristian I am preparing an essay on contemporary
theology for the nnnew paper

What new paper Riccardo frowned It was perhaps an open secret that
a new presslaw was expected and that the Opposition was preparing to
astonish the town with a radical newspaper but still it was formally
a secret

The Swindlers Gazette of course or the Church Calendar

Shsh Rivarez we are disturbing the other readers

Well then stick to your surgery if thats your subject and llleave
me to ththeologythats mine I dddont interfere with your
treatment of broken bones though I know a ppprecious lot more about
them than you do

He sat down to his volume of sermons with an intent and preoccupied
face One of the librarians came up to him

Signor Rivarez I think you were in the Duprez expedition exploring
the tributaries of the Amazon Perhaps you will kindly help us in a
difficulty A lady has been inquiring for the records of the expedition
and they are at the binders

What does she want to know

Only in what year the expedition started and when it passed through
Ecuador

It started from Paris in the autumn of 1837 and passed through Quito
in April 1838 We were three years in Brazil then went down to Rio and
got back to Paris in the summer of 1841 Does the lady want the dates of
the separate discoveries

No thank you only these I have written them down Beppo take this
paper to Signora Bolla please Many thanks Signor Rivarez I am sorry
to have troubled you

The Gadfly leaned back in his chair with a perplexed frown What did she
want the dates for When they passed through Ecuador

Gemma went home with the slip of paper in her hand April 1838and
Arthur had died in May 1833 Five years

She began pacing up and down her room She had slept badly the last few
nights and there were dark shadows under her eyes

Five yearsand an overluxurious homeand someone he had trusted
had deceived himhad deceived himand he had found it out

She stopped and put up both hands to her head Oh this was utterly
madit was not possibleit was absurd

And yet how they had dragged that harbour

Five yearsand he was not twentyone when the Lascar Then he must
have been nineteen when he ran away from home Had he not said A year
and a half Where did he get those blue eyes from and that
nervous restlessness of the fingers And why was he so bitter against
Montanelli Five yearsfive years

If she could but know that he was drownedif she could but have seen
the body some day surely the old wound would have left off aching
the old memory would have lost its terrors Perhaps in another twenty
years she would have learned to look back without shrinking

All her youth had been poisoned by the thought of what she had done
Resolutely day after day and year after year she had fought against
the demon of remorse Always she had remembered that her work lay in the
future always had shut her eyes and ears to the haunting spectre of the
past And day after day year after year the image of the drowned body
drifting out to sea had never left her and the bitter cry that she
could not silence had risen in her heart I have killed Arthur Arthur
is dead Sometimes it had seemed to her that her burden was too heavy
to be borne

Now she would have given half her life to have that burden back again
If she had killed himthat was a familiar grief she had endured it too
long to sink under it now But if she had driven him not into the water
but into She sat down covering her eyes with both hands And her
life had been darkened for his sake because he was dead If she had
brought upon him nothing worse than death

Steadily pitilessly she went back step by step through the hell of
his past life It was as vivid to her as though she had seen and felt
it all the helpless shivering of the naked soul the mockery that
was bitterer than death the horror of loneliness the slow grinding
relentless agony It was as vivid as if she had sat beside him in the
filthy Indian hut as if she had suffered with him in the silvermines
the coffee fields the horrible variety show

The variety show No she must shut out that image at least it was
enough to drive one mad to sit and think of it

She opened a little drawer in her writingdesk It contained the few
personal relics which she could not bring herself to destroy She
was not given to the hoarding up of sentimental trifles and the
preservation of these keepsakes was a concession to that weaker side of
her nature which she kept under with so steady a hand She very seldom
allowed herself to look at them

Now she took them out one after another Giovannis first letter to
her and the flowers that had lain in his dead hand a lock of her
babys hair and a withered leaf from her fathers grave At the back of
the drawer was a miniature portrait of Arthur at ten years oldthe only
existing likeness of him

She sat down with it in her hands and looked at the beautiful childish
head till the face of the real Arthur rose up afresh before her How
clear it was in every detail The sensitive lines of the mouth the
wide earnest eyes the seraphic purity of expressionthey were graven
in upon her memory as though he had died yesterday Slowly the blinding
tears welled up and hid the portrait

Oh how could she have thought such a thing It was like sacrilege even
to dream of this bright faroff spirit bound to the sordid miseries of
life Surely the gods had loved him a little and had let him die young
Better a thousand times that he should pass into utter nothingness than
that he should live and be the Gadflythe Gadfly with his faultless
neckties and his doubtful witticisms his bitter tongue and his ballet
girl No no It was all a horrible senseless fancy and she had vexed
her heart with vain imaginings Arthur was dead

May I come in asked a soft voice at the door

She started so that the portrait fell from her hand and the Gadfly
limping across the room picked it up and handed it to her

How you startled me she said

I am sso sorry Perhaps I am disturbing you

No I was only turning over some old things

She hesitated for a moment then handed him back the miniature

What do you think of that head

While he looked at it she watched his face as though her life depended
upon its expression but it was merely negative and critical

You have set me a difficult task he said The portrait is faded
and a childs face is always hard to read But I should think that child
would grow into an unlucky man and the wisest thing he could do would
be to abstain from growing into a man at all

Why

Look at the line of the underlip Thththat is the sort of nature
that feels pain as pain and wrong as wrong and the world has no
rrroom for such people it needs people who feel nothing but their
work

Is it at all like anyone you know

He looked at the portrait more closely

Yes What a curious thing Of course it is very like

Like whom

Cccardinal Montannelli I wonder whether his irreproachable Eminence
has any nephews by the way Who is it if I may ask

It is a portrait taken in childhood of the friend I told you about
the other day

Whom you killed

She winced in spite of herself How lightly how cruelly he used that
dreadful word

Yes whom I killedif he is really dead

If

She kept her eyes on his face

I have sometimes doubted she said The body was never found He may
have run away from home like you and gone to South America

Let us hope not That would be a bad memory to carry about with you I
have dddone some hard fighting in my ttime and have sent mmore than
one man to Hades perhaps but if I had it on my conscience that I had
sent any lliving thing to South America I should sleep badly

Then do you believe she interrupted coming nearer to him with
clasped hands that if he were not drownedif he had been through
your experience insteadhe would never come back and let the past
go Do you believe he would NEVER forget Remember it has cost me
something too Look

She pushed back the heavy waves of hair from her forehead Through the
black locks ran a broad white streak

There was a long silence

I think the Gadfly said slowly that the dead are better dead
Forgetting some things is a difficult matter And if I were in the place
of your dead friend I would ssstay dead The REVENANT is an ugly
spectre

She put the portrait back into its drawer and locked the desk

That is hard doctrine she said And now we will talk about something
else

I came to have a little business talk with you if I maya private
one about a plan that I have in my head

She drew a chair to the table and sat down What do you think of the
projected presslaw he began without a trace of his usual stammer

What I think of it I think it will not be of much value but half a
loaf is better than no bread

Undoubtedly Then do you intend to work on one of the new papers these
good folk here are preparing to start

I thought of doing so There is always a great deal of practical work
to be done in starting any paperprinting and circulation arrangements
and

How long are you going to waste your mental gifts in that fashion

Why waste

Because it is waste You know quite well that you have a far better
head than most of the men you are working with and you let them make a
regular drudge and Johannes factotum of you Intellectually you are as
far ahead of Grassini and Galli as if they were schoolboys yet you sit
correcting their proofs like a printers devil

In the first place I dont spend all my time in correcting proofs and
moreover it seems to me that you exaggerate my mental capacities They
are by no means so brilliant as you think

I dont think them brilliant at all he answered quietly but I do
think them sound and solid which is of much more importance At those
dreary committee meetings it is always you who put your finger on the
weak spot in everybodys logic

You are not fair to the others Martini for instance has a very
logical head and there is no doubt about the capacities of Fabrizi
and Lega Then Grassini has a sounder knowledge of Italian economic
statistics than any official in the country perhaps

Well thats not saying much but let us lay them and their capacities
aside The fact remains that you with such gifts as you possess
might do more important work and fill a more responsible post than at
present

I am quite satisfied with my position The work I am doing is not of
very much value perhaps but we all do what we can

Signora Bolla you and I have gone too far to play at compliments and
modest denials now Tell me honestly do you recognize that you are
using up your brain on work which persons inferior to you could do as
well

Since you press me for an answeryes to some extent

Then why do you let that go on

No answer

Why do you let it go on

BecauseI cant help it

Why

She looked up reproachfully That is unkindits not fair to press me
so

But all the same you are going to tell me why

If you must have it thenbecause my life has been smashed into
pieces and I have not the energy to start anything REAL now I
am about fit to be a revolutionary cabhorse and do the partys
drudgework At least I do it conscientiously and it must be done by
somebody

Certainly it must be done by somebody but not always by the same
person

Its about all Im fit for

He looked at her with halfshut eyes inscrutably Presently she raised
her head

We are returning to the old subject and this was to be a business
talk It is quite useless I assure you to tell me I might have done
all sorts of things I shall never do them now But I may be able to
help you in thinking out your plan What is it

You begin by telling me that it is useless for me to suggest anything
and then ask what I want to suggest My plan requires your help in
action not only in thinking out

Let me hear it and then we will discuss

Tell me first whether you have heard anything about schemes for a
rising in Venetia

I have heard of nothing but schemes for risings and Sanfedist plots
ever since the amnesty and I fear I am as sceptical about the one as
about the other

So am I in most cases but I am speaking of really serious
preparations for a rising of the whole province against the Austrians
A good many young fellows in the Papal Statesparticularly in the
Four Legationsare secretly preparing to get across there and join as
volunteers And I hear from my friends in the Romagna

Tell me she interrupted are you quite sure that these friends of
yours can be trusted

Quite sure I know them personally and have worked with them

That is they are members of the sect to which you belong Forgive
my scepticism but I am always a little doubtful as to the accuracy
of information received from secret societies It seems to me that the
habit

Who told you I belonged to a sect he interrupted sharply

No one I guessed it

Ah He leaned back in his chair and looked at her frowning Do you
always guess peoples private affairs he said after a moment

Very often I am rather observant and have a habit of putting things
together I tell you that so that you may be careful when you dont want
me to know a thing

I dont mind your knowing anything so long as it goes no further I
suppose this has not

She lifted her head with a gesture of halfoffended surprise Surely
that is an unnecessary question she said

Of course I know you would not speak of anything to outsiders but I
thought that perhaps to the members of your party

The partys business is with facts not with my personal conjectures
and fancies Of course I have never mentioned the subject to anyone

Thank you Do you happen to have guessed which sect I belong to

I hopeyou must not take offence at my frankness it was you who
started this talk you know I do hope it is not the Knifers

Why do you hope that

Because you are fit for better things

We are all fit for better things than we ever do There is your own
answer back again However it is not the Knifers that I belong to
but the Red Girdles They are a steadier lot and take their work more
seriously

Do you mean the work of knifing

That among other things Knives are very useful in their way but only
when you have a good organized propaganda behind them That is what I
dislike in the other sect They think a knife can settle all the worlds
difficulties and thats a mistake It can settle a good many but not
all

Do you honestly believe that it settles any

He looked at her in surprise

Of course she went on it eliminates for the moment the practical
difficulty caused by the presence of a clever spy or objectionable
official but whether it does not create worse difficulties in place of
the one removed is another question It seems to me like the parable of
the swept and garnished house and the seven devils Every assassination
only makes the police more vicious and the people more accustomed to
violence and brutality and the last state of the community may be worse
than the first

What do you think will happen when the revolution comes Do you suppose
the people wont have to get accustomed to violence then War is war

Yes but open revolution is another matter It is one moment in the
peoples life and it is the price we have to pay for all our progress
No doubt fearful things will happen they must in every revolution
But they will be isolated factsexceptional features of an exceptional
moment The horrible thing about this promiscuous knifing is that
it becomes a habit The people get to look upon it as an everyday
occurrence and their sense of the sacredness of human life gets
blunted I have not been much in the Romagna but what little I have
seen of the people has given me the impression that they have got or
are getting into a mechanical habit of violence

Surely even that is better than a mechanical habit of obedience and
submission

I dont think so All mechanical habits are bad and slavish and this
one is ferocious as well Of course if you look upon the work of the
revolutionist as the mere wresting of certain definite concessions from
the government then the secret sect and the knife must seem to you the
best weapons for there is nothing else which all governments so dread
But if you think as I do that to force the governments hand is not an
end in itself but only a means to an end and that what we really
need to reform is the relation between man and man then you must go
differently to work Accustoming ignorant people to the sight of blood
is not the way to raise the value they put on human life

And the value they put on religion

I dont understand

He smiled

I think we differ as to where the root of the mischief lies You place
it in a lack of appreciation of the value of human life

Rather of the sacredness of human personality

Put it as you like To me the great cause of our muddles and mistakes
seems to lie in the mental disease called religion

Do you mean any religion in particular

Oh no That is a mere question of external symptoms The disease
itself is what is called a religious attitude of mind It is the
morbid desire to set up a fetich and adore it to fall down and worship
something It makes little difference whether the something be Jesus or
Buddha or a tumtum tree You dont agree with me of course You may be
atheist or agnostic or anything you like but I could feel the religious
temperament in you at five yards However it is of no use for us to
discuss that But you are quite mistaken in thinking that I for one
look upon the knifing as merely a means of removing objectionable
officialsit is above all a means and I think the best means of
undermining the prestige of the Church and of accustoming people to look
upon clerical agents as upon any other vermin

And when you have accomplished that when you have roused the wild
beast that sleeps in the people and set it on the Church then

Then I shall have done the work that makes it worth my while to live

Is THAT the work you spoke of the other day

Yes just that

She shivered and turned away

You are disappointed in me he said looking up with a smile

No not exactly that I amI thinka little afraid of you

She turned round after a moment and said in her ordinary business voice

This is an unprofitable discussion Our standpoints are too different
For my part I believe in propaganda propaganda and propaganda and
when you can get it open insurrection

Then let us come back to the question of my plan it has something to
do with propaganda and more with insurrection

Yes

As I tell you a good many volunteers are going from the Romagna to
join the Venetians We do not know yet how soon the insurrection will
break out It may not be till the autumn or winter but the volunteers
in the Apennines must be armed and ready so that they may be able to
start for the plains directly they are sent for I have undertaken to
smuggle the firearms and ammunition on to Papal territory for them

Wait a minute How do you come to be working with that set The
revolutionists in Lombardy and Venetia are all in favour of the new
Pope They are going in for liberal reforms hand in hand with
the progressive movement in the Church How can a nocompromise
anticlerical like you get on with them

He shrugged his shoulders What is it to me if they like to amuse
themselves with a ragdoll so long as they do their work Of course
they will take the Pope for a figurehead What have I to do with that
if only the insurrection gets under way somehow Any stick will do
to beat a dog with I suppose and any cry to set the people on the
Austrians

What is it you want me to do

Chiefly to help me get the firearms across

But how could I do that

You are just the person who could do it best I think of buying the
arms in England and there is a good deal of difficulty about bringing
them over Its impossible to get them through any of the Pontifical
seaports they must come by Tuscany and go across the Apennines

That makes two frontiers to cross instead of one

Yes but the other way is hopeless you cant smuggle a big transport
in at a harbour where there is no trade and you know the whole shipping
of Civita Vecchia amounts to about three rowboats and a fishing
smack If we once get the things across Tuscany I can manage the Papal
frontier my men know every path in the mountains and we have plenty of
hidingplaces The transport must come by sea to Leghorn and that is
my great difficulty I am not in with the smugglers there and I believe
you are

Give me five minutes to think

She leaned forward resting one elbow on her knee and supporting the
chin on the raised hand After a few moments silence she looked up

It is possible that I might be of some use in that part of the work
she said but before we go any further I want to ask you a question
Can you give me your word that this business is not connected with any
stabbing or secret violence of any kind

Certainly It goes without saying that I should not have asked you to
join in a thing of which I know you disapprove

When do you want a definite answer from me

There is not much time to lose but I can give you a few days to decide
in

Are you free next Saturday evening

Let me seetoday is Thursday yes

Then come here I will think the matter over and give you a final
answer

 

On the following Sunday Gemma sent in to the committee of the Florentine
branch of the Mazzinian party a statement that she wished to undertake a
special work of a political nature which would for a few months prevent
her from performing the functions for which she had up till now been
responsible to the party

Some surprise was felt at this announcement but the committee raised no
objection she had been known in the party for several years as a person
whose judgment might be trusted and the members agreed that if Signora
Bolla took an unexpected step she probably had good reasons for it

To Martini she said frankly that she had undertaken to help the Gadfly
with some frontier work She had stipulated for the right to tell her
old friend this much in order that there might be no misunderstanding
or painful sense of doubt and mystery between them It seemed to her
that she owed him this proof of confidence He made no comment when she
told him but she saw without knowing why that the news had wounded
him deeply

They were sitting on the terrace of her lodging looking out over the
red roofs to Fiesole After a long silence Martini rose and began
tramping up and down with his hands in his pockets whistling to
himselfa sure sign with him of mental agitation She sat looking at
him for a little while

Cesare you are worried about this affair she said at last I am
very sorry you feel so despondent over it but I could decide only as
seemed right to me

It is not the affair he answered sullenly I know nothing about
it and it probably is all right once you have consented to go into it
Its the MAN I distrust

I think you misunderstand him I did till I got to know him better He
is far from perfect but there is much more good in him than you think

Very likely For a moment he tramped to and fro in silence then
suddenly stopped beside her

Gemma give it up Give it up before it is too late Dont let that man
drag you into things you will repent afterwards

Cesare she said gently you are not thinking what you are saying
No one is dragging me into anything I have made this decision of my
own will after thinking the matter well over alone You have a personal
dislike to Rivarez I know but we are talking of politics now not of
persons

Madonna Give it up That man is dangerous he is secret and cruel
and unscrupulousand he is in love with you

She drew back

Cesare how can you get such fancies into your head

He is in love with you Martini repeated Keep clear of him
Madonna

Dear Cesare I cant keep clear of him and I cant explain to you why
We are tied togethernot by any wish or doing of our own

If you are tied there is nothing more to say Martini answered
wearily

He went away saying that he was busy and tramped for hours up and down
the muddy streets The world looked very black to him that evening One
poor ewelamband this slippery creature had stepped in and stolen it
away



CHAPTER X

TOWARDS the middle of February the Gadfly went to Leghorn Gemma had
introduced him to a young Englishman there a shippingagent of liberal
views whom she and her husband had known in England He had on several
occasions performed little services for the Florentine radicals had
lent money to meet an unforeseen emergency had allowed his business
address to be used for the partys letters etc but always through
Gemmas mediumship and as a private friend of hers She was therefore
according to party etiquette free to make use of the connexion in any
way that might seem good to her Whether any use could be got out of it
was quite another question To ask a friendly sympathizer to lend his
address for letters from Sicily or to keep a few documents in a corner
of his countinghouse safe was one thing to ask him to smuggle over a
transport of firearms for an insurrection was another and she had very
little hope of his consenting

You can but try she had said to the Gadfly but I dont think
anything will come of it If you were to go to him with that
recommendation and ask for five hundred scudi I dare say hed give them
to you at oncehes exceedingly generousand perhaps at a pinch he
would lend you his passport or hide a fugitive in his cellar but if you
mention such a thing as rifles he will stare at you and think were both
demented

Perhaps he may give me a few hints though or introduce me to a
friendly sailor or two the Gadfly had answered Anyway its worth
while to try

One day at the end of the month he came into her study less carefully
dressed than usual and she saw at once from his face that he had good
news to tell

Ah at last I was beginning to think something must have happened to
you

I thought it safer not to write and I couldnt get back sooner

You have just arrived

Yes I am straight from the diligence I looked in to tell you that the
affair is all settled

Do you mean that Bailey has really consented to help

More than to help he has undertaken the whole thingpacking
transportseverything The rifles will be hidden in bales of
merchandise and will come straight through from England His partner
Williams who is a great friend of his has consented to see the
transport off from Southampton and Bailey will slip it through the
custom house at Leghorn That is why I have been such a long time
Williams was just starting for Southampton and I went with him as far
as Genoa

To talk over details on the way

Yes as long as I wasnt too seasick to talk about anything

Are you a bad sailor she asked quickly remembering how Arthur had
suffered from seasickness one day when her father had taken them both
for a pleasuretrip

About as bad as is possible in spite of having been at sea so much
But we had a talk while they were loading at Genoa You know Williams
I think Hes a thoroughly good fellow trustworthy and sensible so is
Bailey for that matter and they both know how to hold their tongues

It seems to me though that Bailey is running a serious risk in doing
a thing like this

So I told him and he only looked sulky and said What business is
that of yours Just the sort of thing one would expect him to say If
I met Bailey in Timbuctoo I should go up to him and say Goodmorning
Englishman

But I cant conceive how you managed to get their consent Williams
too the last man I should have thought of

Yes he objected strongly at first not on the ground of danger
though but because the thing is so unbusinesslike But I managed to
win him over after a bit And now we will go into details

 

When the Gadfly reached his lodgings the sun had set and the blossoming
pyrus japonica that hung over the garden wall looked dark in the fading
light He gathered a few sprays and carried them into the house As he
opened the study door Zita started up from a chair in the corner and
ran towards him

Oh Felice I thought you were never coming

His first impulse was to ask her sharply what business she had in his
study but remembering that he had not seen her for three weeks he
held out his hand and said rather frigidly

Goodevening Zita how are you

She put up her face to be kissed but he moved past as though he had
not seen the gesture and took up a vase to put the pyrus in The next
instant the door was flung wide open and the collie rushing into the
room performed an ecstatic dance round him barking and whining with
delight He put down the flowers and stooped to pat the dog

Well Shaitan how are you old man Yes its really I Shake hands
like a good dog

The hard sullen look came into Zitas face

Shall we go to dinner she asked coldly I ordered it for you at my
place as you wrote that you were coming this evening

He turned round quickly

I am vvvery sorry you shshould not have waited for me I will just
get a bit tidy and come round at once Pperhaps you would not mind
putting these into water

When he came into Zitas dining room she was standing before a mirror
fastening one of the sprays into her dress She had apparently made up
her mind to be goodhumoured and came up to him with a little cluster
of crimson buds tied together

Here is a buttonhole for you let me put it in your coat

All through dinnertime he did his best to be amiable and kept up a
flow of smalltalk to which she responded with radiant smiles Her
evident joy at his return somewhat embarrassed him he had grown so
accustomed to the idea that she led her own life apart from his among
such friends and companions as were congenial to her that it had never
occurred to him to imagine her as missing him And yet she must have
felt dull to be so much excited now

Let us have coffee up on the terrace she said it is quite warm this
evening

Very well Shall I take your guitar Perhaps you will sing

She flushed with delight he was critical about music and did not often
ask her to sing

On the terrace was a broad wooden bench running round the walls The
Gadfly chose a corner with a good view of the hills and Zita seating
herself on the low wall with her feet on the bench leaned back against
a pillar of the roof She did not care much for scenery she preferred
to look at the Gadfly

Give me a cigarette she said I dont believe I have smoked once
since you went away

Happy thought Its just sssmoke I want to complete my bliss

She leaned forward and looked at him earnestly

Are you really happy

The Gadflys mobile brows went up

Yes why not I have had a good dinner I am looking at one of the
mmost beautiful views in Europe and now Im going to have coffee and
hear a Hungarian folksong There is nothing the matter with either my
conscience or my digestion what more can man desire

I know another thing you desire

What

That She tossed a little cardboard box into his hand

Bburnt almonds Why ddidnt you tell me before I began to ssmoke
he cried reproachfully

Why you baby you can eat them when you have done smoking There comes
the coffee

The Gadfly sipped his coffee and ate his burnt almonds with the grave
and concentrated enjoyment of a cat drinking cream

How nice it is to come back to ddecent coffee after the ssstuff one
gets at Leghorn he said in his purring drawl

A very good reason for stopping at home now you are here

Not much stopping for me Im off again tomorrow

The smile died on her face

Tomorrow What for Where are you going to

Oh two or three ppplaces on business

It had been decided between him and Gemma that he must go in person into
the Apennines to make arrangements with the smugglers of the frontier
region about the transporting of the firearms To cross the Papal
frontier was for him a matter of serious danger but it had to be done
if the work was to succeed

Always business Zita sighed under her breath and then asked aloud

Shall you be gone long

No only a fortnight or three weeks ppprobably

I suppose its some of THAT business she asked abruptly

That business

The business youre always trying to get your neck broken overthe
everlasting politics

It has something to do with pppolitics

Zita threw away her cigarette

You are fooling me she said You are going into some danger or
other

Im going ssstraight into the infernal regions he answered
languidly Ddo you happen to have any friends there you want to send
that ivy to You nneednt pull it all down though

She had fiercely torn off a handful of the climber from the pillar and
now flung it down with vehement anger

You are going into danger she repeated and you wont even say so
honestly Do you think I am fit for nothing but to be fooled and joked
with You will get yourself hanged one of these days and never so
much as say goodbye Its always politics and politicsIm sick of
politics

Sso am I said the Gadfly yawning lazily and therefore well talk
about something elseunless you will sing

Well give me the guitar then What shall I sing

The ballad of the lost horse it suits your voice so well

She began to sing the old Hungarian ballad of the man who loses first
his horse then his home and then his sweetheart and consoles himself
with the reflection that more was lost at Mohacz field The song was
one of the Gadflys especial favourites its fierce and tragic melody
and the bitter stoicism of the refrain appealed to him as no softer
music ever did

Zita was in excellent voice the notes came from her lips strong and
clear full of the vehement desire of life She would have sung Italian
or Slavonic music badly and German still worse but she sang the Magyar
folksongs splendidly

The Gadfly listened with wideopen eyes and parted lips he had never
heard her sing like this before As she came to the last line her voice
began suddenly to shake


 Ah no matter More was lost


She broke down with a sob and hid her face among the ivy leaves

Zita The Gadfly rose and took the guitar from her hand What is it

She only sobbed convulsively hiding her face in both hands He touched
her on the arm

Tell me what is the matter he said caressingly

Let me alone she sobbed shrinking away Let me alone

He went quietly back to his seat and waited till the sobs died away
Suddenly he felt her arms about his neck she was kneeling on the floor
beside him

Felicedont go Dont go away

We will talk about that afterwards he said gently extricating
himself from the clinging arms Tell me first what has upset you so
Has anything been frightening you

She silently shook her head

Have I done anything to hurt you

No She put a hand up against his throat

What then

You will get killed she whispered at last I heard one of those men
that come here say the other day that you will get into troubleand
when I ask you about it you laugh at me

My dear child the Gadfly said after a little pause of astonishment
you have got some exaggerated notion into your head Very likely I
shall get killed some daythat is the natural consequence of being a
revolutionist But there is no reason to suppose I am gggoing to get
killed just now I am running no more risk than other people

Other peoplewhat are other people to me If you loved me you wouldnt
go off this way and leave me to lie awake at night wondering whether
youre arrested or dream you are dead whenever I go to sleep You dont
care as much for me as for that dog there

The Gadfly rose and walked slowly to the other end of the terrace
He was quite unprepared for such a scene as this and at a loss how to
answer her Yes Gemma was right he had got his life into a tangle that
he would have hard work to undo

Sit down and let us talk about it quietly he said coming back after
a moment I think we have misunderstood each other of course I should
not have laughed if I had thought you were serious Try to tell
me plainly what is troubling you and then if there is any
misunderstanding we may be able to clear it up

Theres nothing to clear up I can see you dont care a brass farthing
for me

My dear child we had better be quite frank with each other I have
always tried to be honest about our relationship and I think I have
never deceived you as to

Oh no you have been honest enough you have never even pretended
to think of me as anything else but a prostitutea trumpery bit of
secondhand finery that plenty of other men have had before you

Hush Zita I have never thought that way about any living thing

You have never loved me she insisted sullenly

No I have never loved you Listen to me and try to think as little
harm of me as you can

Who said I thought any harm of you I

Wait a minute This is what I want to say I have no belief whatever in
conventional moral codes and no respect for them To me the relations
between men and women are simply questions of personal likes and
dislikes

And of money she interrupted with a harsh little laugh He winced and
hesitated a moment

That of course is the ugly part of the matter But believe me if I
had thought that you disliked me or felt any repulsion to the thing
I would never have suggested it or taken advantage of your position to
persuade you to it I have never done that to any woman in my life and
I have never told a woman a lie about my feeling for her You may trust
me that I am speaking the truth

He paused a moment but she did not answer

I thought he went on that if a man is alone in the world and feels
the need ofof a womans presence about him and if he can find a woman
who is attractive to him and to whom he is not repulsive he has a right
to accept in a grateful and friendly spirit such pleasure as that
woman is willing to give him without entering into any closer bond I
saw no harm in the thing provided only there is no unfairness or insult
or deceit on either side As for your having been in that relation with
other men before I met you I did not think about that I merely thought
that the connexion would be a pleasant and harmless one for both of us
and that either was free to break it as soon as it became irksome If I
was mistakenif you have grown to look upon it differentlythen

He paused again

Then she whispered without looking up

Then I have done you a wrong and I am very sorry But I did not mean
to do it

You did not mean and you thoughtFelice are you made of cast
iron Have you never been in love with a woman in your life that you
cant see I love you

A sudden thrill went through him it was so long since anyone had said
to him I love you Instantly she started up and flung her arms round
him

Felice come away with me Come away from this dreadful country and all
these people and their politics What have we got to do with them Come
away and we will be happy together Let us go to South America where
you used to live

The physical horror of association startled him back into selfcontrol
he unclasped her hands from his neck and held them in a steady grasp

Zita Try to understand what I am saying to you I do not love you and
if I did I would not come away with you I have my work in Italy and my
comrades

And someone else that you love better than me she cried out fiercely
Oh I could kill you It is not your comrades you care about its
I know who it is

Hush he said quietly You are excited and imagining things that are
not true

You suppose I am thinking of Signora Bolla Im not so easily duped
You only talk politics with her you care no more for her than you do
for me Its that Cardinal

The Gadfly started as if he had been shot

Cardinal he repeated mechanically

Cardinal Montanelli that came here preaching in the autumn Do you
think I didnt see your face when his carriage passed You were as white
as my pockethandkerchief Why youre shaking like a leaf now because I
mentioned his name

He stood up

You dont know what you are talking about he said very slowly and
softly Ihate the Cardinal He is the worst enemy I have

Enemy or no you love him better than you love anyone else in the
world Look me in the face and say that is not true if you can

He turned away and looked out into the garden She watched him
furtively halfscared at what she had done there was something
terrifying in his silence At last she stole up to him like a
frightened child and timidly pulled his sleeve He turned round

It is true he said



CHAPTER XI

BUT cccant I meet him somewhere in the hills Brisighella is a risky
place for me

Every inch of ground in the Romagna is risky for you but just at this
moment Brisighella is safer for you than any other place

Why

Ill tell you in a minute Dont let that man with the blue jacket
see your face hes dangerous Yes it was a terrible storm I dont
remember to have seen the vines so bad for a long time

The Gadfly spread his arms on the table and laid his face upon them
like a man overcome with fatigue or wine and the dangerous newcomer in
the blue jacket glancing swiftly round saw only two farmers discussing
their crops over a flask of wine and a sleepy mountaineer with his head
on the table It was the usual sort of thing to see in little places
like Marradi and the owner of the blue jacket apparently made up his
mind that nothing could be gained by listening for he drank his wine at
a gulp and sauntered into the outer room There he stood leaning on the
counter and gossiping lazily with the landlord glancing every now and
then out of the corner of one eye through the open door beyond which
sat the three figures at the table The two farmers went on sipping
their wine and discussing the weather in the local dialect and the
Gadfly snored like a man whose conscience is sound

At last the spy seemed to make up his mind that there was nothing in the
wineshop worth further waste of his time He paid his reckoning and
lounging out of the house sauntered away down the narrow street The
Gadfly yawning and stretching lifted himself up and sleepily rubbed
the sleeve of his linen blouse across his eyes

Pretty sharp practice that he said pulling a claspknife out of his
pocket and cutting off a chunk from the ryeloaf on the table Have
they been worrying you much lately Michele

Theyve been worse than mosquitos in August Theres no getting a
minutes peace wherever one goes theres always a spy hanging
about Even right up in the hills where they used to be so shy about
venturing they have taken to coming in bands of three or fourhavent
they Gino Thats why we arranged for you to meet Domenichino in the
town

Yes but why Brisighella A frontier town is always full of spies

Brisighella just now is a capital place Its swarming with pilgrims
from all parts of the country

But its not on the way to anywhere

Its not far out of the way to Rome and many of the Easter Pilgrims
are going round to hear Mass there

I dddidnt know there was anything special in Brisighella

Theres the Cardinal Dont you remember his going to Florence to
preach last December Its that same Cardinal Montanelli They say he
made a great sensation

I dare say I dont go to hear sermons

Well he has the reputation of being a saint you see

How does he manage that

I dont know I suppose its because he gives away all his income and
lives like a parish priest with four or five hundred scudi a year

Ah interposed the man called Gino but its more than that He
doesnt only give away money he spends his whole life in looking
after the poor and seeing the sick are properly treated and hearing
complaints and grievances from morning till night Im no fonder of
priests than you are Michele but Monsignor Montanelli is not like
other Cardinals

Oh I dare say hes more fool than knave said Michele Anyhow the
people are mad after him and the last new freak is for the pilgrims to
go round that way to ask his blessing Domenichino thought of going as a
pedlar with a basket of cheap crosses and rosaries The people like to
buy those things and ask the Cardinal to touch them then they put them
round their babies necks to keep off the evil eye

Wait a minute How am I to goas a pilgrim This makeup suits me
ppretty well I think but it wwont do for me to show myself
in Brisighella in the same character that I had here it would be
evvvidence against you if I get taken

You wont get taken we have a splendid disguise for you with a
passport and all complete

What is it

An old Spanish pilgrima repentant brigand from the Sierras He fell
ill in Ancona last year and one of our friends took him on board a
tradingvessel out of charity and set him down in Venice where he had
friends and he left his papers with us to show his gratitude They will
just do for you

A repentant bbbrigand But wwhat about the police

Oh thats all right He finished his term of the galleys some years
ago and has been going about to Jerusalem and all sorts of places
saving his soul ever since He killed his son by mistake for somebody
else and gave himself up to the police in a fit of remorse

Was he quite old

Yes but a white beard and wig will set that right and the description
suits you to perfection in every other respect He was an old soldier
with a lame foot and a sabrecut across the face like yours and then
his being a Spaniard tooyou see if you meet any Spanish pilgrims
you can talk to them all right

Where am I to meet Domenichino

You join the pilgrims at the crossroad that we will show you on the
map saying you had lost your way in the hills Then when you reach the
town you go with the rest of them into the marketplace in front of the
Cardinals palace

Oh he manages to live in a ppalace then in sspite of being a
saint

He lives in one wing of it and has turned the rest into a hospital
Well you all wait there for him to come out and give his benediction
and Domenichino will come up with his basket and say Are you one of
the pilgrims father and you answer I am a miserable sinner Then
he puts down his basket and wipes his face with his sleeve and you
offer him six soldi for a rosary

Then of course he arranges where we can talk

Yes he will have plenty of time to give you the address of the
meetingplace while the people are gaping at Montanelli That was our
plan but if you dont like it we can let Domenichino know and arrange
something else

No it will do only see that the beard and wig look natural

 

Are you one of the pilgrims father

The Gadfly sitting on the steps of the episcopal palace looked up
from under his ragged white locks and gave the password in a husky
trembling voice with a strong foreign accent Domenichino slipped
the leather strap from his shoulder and set down his basket of pious
gewgaws on the step The crowd of peasants and pilgrims sitting on the
steps and lounging about the marketplace was taking no notice of
them but for precautions sake they kept up a desultory conversation
Domenichino speaking in the local dialect and the Gadfly in broken
Italian intermixed with Spanish words

His Eminence His Eminence is coming out shouted the people by the
door Stand aside His Eminence is coming

They both stood up

Here father said Domenichino putting into the Gadflys hand a
little image wrapped in paper take this too and pray for me when you
get to Rome

The Gadfly thrust it into his breast and turned to look at the figure
in the violet Lenten robe and scarlet cap that was standing on the upper
step and blessing the people with outstretched arms

Montanelli came slowly down the steps the people crowding about him to
kiss his hands Many knelt down and put the hem of his cassock to their
lips as he passed

Peace be with you my children

At the sound of the clear silvery voice the Gadfly bent his head so
that the white hair fell across his face and Domenichino seeing the
quivering of the pilgrims staff in his hand said to himself with
admiration What an actor

A woman standing near to them stooped down and lifted her child from the
step Come Cecco she said His Eminence will bless you as the dear
Lord blessed the children

The Gadfly moved a step forward and stopped Oh it was hard All these
outsidersthese pilgrims and mountaineerscould go up and speak to
him and he would lay his hand on their childrens hair Perhaps he
would say Carino to that peasant boy as he used to say

The Gadfly sank down again on the step turning away that he might not
see If only he could shrink into some corner and stop his ears to shut
out the sound Indeed it was more than any man should have to bearto
be so close so close that he could have put out his arm and touched the
dear hand

Will you not come under shelter my friend the soft voice said I am
afraid you are chilled

The Gadflys heart stood still For a moment he was conscious of nothing
but the sickening pressure of the blood that seemed as if it would tear
his breast asunder then it rushed back tingling and burning through
all his body and he looked up The grave deep eyes above him grew
suddenly tender with divine compassion at the sight of his face

Stand bark a little friends Montanelli said turning to the crowd
I want to speak to him

The people fell slowly back whispering to each other and the Gadfly
sitting motionless with teeth clenched and eyes on the ground felt the
gentle touch of Montanellis hand upon his shoulder

You have had some great trouble Can I do anything to help you

The Gadfly shook his head in silence

Are you a pilgrim

I am a miserable sinner

The accidental similarity of Montanellis question to the password came
like a chance straw that the Gadfly in his desperation caught at
answering automatically He had begun to tremble under the soft pressure
of the hand that seemed to burn upon his shoulder

The Cardinal bent down closer to him

Perhaps you would care to speak to me alone If I can be any help to
you

For the first time the Gadfly looked straight and steadily into
Montanellis eyes he was already recovering his selfcommand

It would be no use he said the thing is hopeless

A police official stepped forward out of the crowd

Forgive my intruding Your Eminence I think the old man is not quite
sound in his mind He is perfectly harmless and his papers are in
order so we dont interfere with him He has been in penal servitude
for a great crime and is now doing penance

A great crime the Gadfly repeated shaking his head slowly

Thank you captain stand aside a little please My friend nothing is
hopeless if a man has sincerely repented Will you not come to me this
evening

Would Your Eminence receive a man who is guilty of the death of his own
son

The question had almost the tone of a challenge and Montanelli shrank
and shivered under it as under a cold wind

God forbid that I should condemn you whatever you have done he said
solemnly In His sight we are all guilty alike and our righteousness
is as filthy rags If you will come to me I will receive you as I pray
that He may one day receive me

The Gadfly stretched out his hands with a sudden gesture of passion

Listen he said and listen all of you Christians If a man has
killed his only sonhis son who loved and trusted him who was flesh of
his flesh and bone of his bone if he has led his son into a deathtrap
with lies and deceitis there hope for that man in earth or heaven
I have confessed my sin before God and man and I have suffered the
punishment that men have laid on me and they have let me go but when
will God say It is enough What benediction will take away His curse
from my soul What absolution will undo this thing that I have done

In the dead silence that followed the people looked at Montanelli and
saw the heaving of the cross upon his breast

He raised his eyes at last and gave the benediction with a hand that
was not quite steady

God is merciful he said Lay your burden before His throne for it
is written A broken and contrite heart shalt thou not despise

He turned away and walked through the marketplace stopping everywhere
to speak to the people and to take their children in his arms

In the evening the Gadfly following the directions written on the
wrapping of the image made his way to the appointed meetingplace It
was the house of a local doctor who was an active member of the sect
Most of the conspirators were already assembled and their delight at
the Gadflys arrival gave him a new proof if he had needed one of his
popularity as a leader

Were glad enough to see you again said the doctor but we shall be
gladder still to see you go Its a fearfully risky business and I for
one was against the plan Are you quite sure none of those police rats
noticed you in the marketplace this morning

Oh they nnoticed me enough but they ddidnt recognize me
Domenichino mmanaged the thing capitally But where is he I dont see
him

He has not come yet So you got on all smoothly Did the Cardinal give
you his blessing

His blessing Oh thats nothing said Domenichino coming in at the
door Rivarez youre as full of surprises as a Christmas cake How
many more talents are you going to astonish us with

What is it now asked the Gadfly languidly He was leaning back on a
sofa smoking a cigar He still wore his pilgrims dress but the white
beard and wig lay beside him

I had no idea you were such an actor I never saw a thing done so
magnificently in my life You nearly moved His Eminence to tears

How was that Let us hear Rivarez

The Gadfly shrugged his shoulders He was in a taciturn and laconic
mood and the others seeing that nothing was to be got out of him
appealed to Domenichino to explain When the scene in the marketplace
had been related one young workman who had not joined in the laughter
of the rest remarked abruptly

It was very clever of course but I dont see what good all this
playacting business has done to anybody

Just this much the Gadfly put in that I can go where I like and do
what I like anywhere in this district and not a single man woman or
child will ever think of suspecting me The story will be all over the
place by tomorrow and when I meet a spy he will only think Its
mad Diego that confessed his sins in the marketplace That is an
advantage gained surely

Yes I see Still I wish the thing could have been done without
fooling the Cardinal Hes too good to have that sort of trick played on
him

I thought myself he seemed fairly decent the Gadfly lazily assented

Nonsense Sandro We dont want Cardinals here said Domenichino
And if Monsignor Montanelli had taken that post in Rome when he had the
chance of getting it Rivarez couldnt have fooled him

He wouldnt take it because he didnt want to leave his work here

More likely because he didnt want to get poisoned off by
Lambruschinis agents Theyve got something against him you may depend
upon it When a Cardinal especially such a popular one prefers to
stay in a Godforsaken little hole like this we all know what that
meansdont we Rivarez

The Gadfly was making smokerings Perhaps it is a cccase of a
bbbroken and contrite heart he remarked leaning his head back to
watch them float away And now men let us get to business

They began to discuss in detail the various plans which had been formed
for the smuggling and concealment of weapons The Gadfly listened with
keen attention interrupting every now and then to correct sharply some
inaccurate statement or imprudent proposal When everyone had finished
speaking he made a few practical suggestions most of which were
adopted without discussion The meeting then broke up It had been
resolved that at least until he was safely back in Tuscany very
late meetings which might attract the notice of the police should
be avoided By a little after ten oclock all had dispersed except the
doctor the Gadfly and Domenichino who remained as a subcommittee
for the discussion of special points After a long and hot dispute
Domenichino looked up at the clock

Halfpast eleven we mustnt stop any longer or the nightwatchman may
see us

When does he pass asked the Gadfly

About twelve oclock and I want to be home before he comes
Goodnight Giordani Rivarez shall we walk together

No I think we are safer apart Then I shall see you again

Yes at Castel Bolognese I dont know yet what disguise I shall be in
but you have the password You leave here tomorrow I think

The Gadfly was carefully putting on his beard and wig before the
lookingglass

Tomorrow morning with the pilgrims On the next day I fall ill and
stop behind in a shepherds hut and then take a short cut across the
hills I shall be down there before you will Goodnight

Twelve oclock was striking from the Cathedral belltower as the Gadfly
looked in at the door of the great empty barn which had been thrown
open as a lodging for the pilgrims The floor was covered with
clumsy figures most of which were snoring lustily and the air was
insufferably close and foul He drew back with a little shudder of
repugnance it would be useless to attempt to sleep in there he would
take a walk and then find some shed or haystack which would at least
be clean and quiet

It was a glorious night with a great full moon gleaming in a purple
sky He began to wander through the streets in an aimless way brooding
miserably over the scene of the morning and wishing that he had never
consented to Domenichinos plan of holding the meeting in Brisighella
If at the beginning he had declared the project too dangerous some
other place would have been chosen and both he and Montanelli would
have been spared this ghastly ridiculous farce

How changed the Padre was And yet his voice was not changed at all it
was just the same as in the old days when he used to say Carino

The lantern of the nightwatchman appeared at the other end of the
street and the Gadfly turned down a narrow crooked alley After
walking a few yards he found himself in the Cathedral Square close
to the left wing of the episcopal palace The square was flooded with
moonlight and there was no one in sight but he noticed that a side
door of the Cathedral was ajar The sacristan must have forgotten to
shut it Surely nothing could be going on there so late at night He
might as well go in and sleep on one of the benches instead of in the
stifling barn he could slip out in the morning before the sacristan
came and even if anyone did find him the natural supposition would be
that mad Diego had been saying his prayers in some corner and had got
shut in

He listened a moment at the door and then entered with the noiseless
step that he had retained notwithstanding his lameness The moonlight
streamed through the windows and lay in broad bands on the marble
floor In the chancel especially everything was as clearly visible as
by daylight At the foot of the altar steps Cardinal Montanelli knelt
alone bareheaded with clasped hands

The Gadfly drew back into the shadow Should he slip away before
Montanelli saw him That no doubt would be the wisest thing to
doperhaps the most merciful And yet what harm could it do for him to
go just a little nearerto look at the Padres face once more now that
the crowd was gone and there was no need to keep up the hideous comedy
of the morning Perhaps it would be his last chanceand the Padre need
not see him he would steal up softly and lookjust this once Then he
would go back to his work

Keeping in the shadow of the pillars he crept softly up to the chancel
rails and paused at the side entrance close to the altar The shadow
of the episcopal throne was broad enough to cover him and he crouched
down in the darkness holding his breath

My poor boy Oh God my poor boy

The broken whisper was full of such endless despair that the Gadfly
shuddered in spite of himself Then came deep heavy tearless sobs and
he saw Montanelli wring his hands together like a man in bodily pain

He had not thought it would be so bad as this How often had he said to
himself with bitter assurance I need not trouble about it that wound
was healed long ago Now after all these years it was laid bare
before him and he saw it bleeding still And how easy it would be to
heal it now at last He need only lift his handonly step forward and
say Padre it is I There was Gemma too with that white streak
across her hair Oh if he could but forgive If he could but cut out
from his memory the past that was burned into it so deepthe Lascar
and the sugarplantation and the variety show Surely there was no
other misery like thisto be willing to forgive to long to forgive
and to know that it was hopelessthat he could not dared not forgive

Montanelli rose at last made the sign of the cross and turned
away from the altar The Gadfly shrank further back into the shadow
trembling with fear lest he should be seen lest the very beating of
his heart should betray him then he drew a long breath of relief
Montanelli had passed him so close that the violet robe had brushed
against his cheekhad passed and had not seen him

Had not seen him Oh what had he done This had been his last
chancethis one precious momentand he had let it slip away He
started up and stepped into the light

Padre

The sound of his own voice ringing up and dying away along the arches
of the roof filled him with fantastic terror He shrank back again into
the shadow Montanelli stood beside the pillar motionless listening
with wideopen eyes full of the horror of death How long the silence
lasted the Gadfly could not tell it might have been an instant or
an eternity He came to his senses with a sudden shock Montanelli was
beginning to sway as though he would fall and his lips moved at first
silently

Arthur the low whisper came at last yes the water is deep

The Gadfly came forward

Forgive me Your Eminence I thought it was one of the priests

Ah it is the pilgrim Montanelli had at once recovered his
selfcontrol though the Gadfly could see from the restless glitter of
the sapphire on his hand that he was still trembling Are you in
need of anything my friend It is late and the Cathedral is closed at
night

I beg pardon Your Eminence if I have done wrong I saw the door
open and came in to pray and when I saw a priest as I thought in
meditation I waited to ask a blessing on this

He held up the little tin cross that he had bought from Domenichino
Montanelli took it from his hand and reentering the chancel laid it
for a moment on the altar

Take it my son he said and be at rest for the Lord is tender
and pitiful Go to Rome and ask the blessing of His minister the Holy
Father Peace be with you

The Gadfly bent his head to receive the benediction and turned slowly
away

Stop said Montanelli

He was standing with one hand on the chancel rail

When you receive the Holy Eucharist in Rome he said pray for one in
deep afflictionfor one on whose soul the hand of the Lord is heavy

There were almost tears in his voice and the Gadflys resolution
wavered Another instant and he would have betrayed himself Then the
thought of the varietyshow came up again and he remembered like
Jonah that he did well to be angry

Who am I that He should hear my prayers A leper and an outcast If I
could bring to His throne as Your Eminence can the offering of a holy
lifeof a soul without spot or secret shame

Montanelli turned abruptly away

I have only one offering to give he said a broken heart

 

A few days later the Gadfly returned to Florence in the diligence from
Pistoja He went straight to Gemmas lodgings but she was out Leaving
a message that he would return in the morning he went home sincerely
hoping that he should not again find his study invaded by Zita Her
jealous reproaches would act on his nerves if he were to hear much of
them tonight like the rasping of a dentists file

Goodevening Bianca he said when the maidservant opened the door
Has Mme Reni been here today

She stared at him blankly

Mme Reni Has she come back then sir

What do you mean he asked with a frown stopping short on the mat

She went away quite suddenly just after you did and left all her
things behind her She never so much as said she was going

Just after I did What a ffortnight ago

Yes sir the same day and her things are lying about
higgledypiggledy All the neighbours are talking about it

He turned away from the doorstep without speaking and went hastily
down the lane to the house where Zita had been lodging In her rooms
nothing had been touched all the presents that he had given her were in
their usual places there was no letter or scrap of writing anywhere

If you please sir said Bianca putting her head in at the door
theres an old woman

He turned round fiercely

What do you want herefollowing me about

An old woman wishes to see you

What does she want Tell her I ccant see her Im busy

She has been coming nearly every evening since you went away sir
always asking when you would come back

Ask her wwhat her business is No never mind I suppose I must go
myself

The old woman was waiting at his hall door She was very poorly dressed
with a face as brown and wrinkled as a medlar and a brightcoloured
scarf twisted round her head As he came in she rose and looked at him
with keen black eyes

You are the lame gentleman she said inspecting him critically from
head to foot I have brought you a message from Zita Reni

He opened the study door and held it for her to pass in then followed
her and shut the door that Bianca might not hear

Sit down please Nnow tell me who you are

Its no business of yours who I am I have come to tell you that Zita
Reni has gone away with my son

Withyourson

Yes sir if you dont know how to keep your mistress when youve got
her you cant complain if other men take her My son has blood in his
veins not milk and water he comes of the Romany folk

Ah you are a gipsy Zita has gone back to her own people then

She looked at him in amazed contempt Apparently these Christians had
not even manhood enough to be angry when they were insulted

What sort of stuff are you made of that she should stay with you Our
women may lend themselves to you a bit for a girls fancy or if you pay
them well but the Romany blood comes back to the Romany folk

The Gadflys face remained as cold and steady as before

Has she gone away with a gipsy camp or merely to live with your son

The woman burst out laughing

Do you think of following her and trying to win her back Its too
late sir you should have thought of that before

No I only want to know the truth if you will tell it to me

She shrugged her shoulders it was hardly worth while to abuse a person
who took it so meekly

The truth then is that she met my son in the road the day you left
her and spoke to him in the Romany tongue and when he saw she was
one of our folk in spite of her fine clothes he fell in love with her
bonny face as OUR men fall in love and took her to our camp She told
us all her trouble and sat crying and sobbing poor lassie till our
hearts were sore for her We comforted her as best we could and at last
she took off her fine clothes and put on the things our lasses wear and
gave herself to my son to be his woman and to have him for her man He
wont say to her I dont love you and Ive other things to do
When a woman is young she wants a man and what sort of man are you
that you cant even kiss a handsome girl when she puts her arms round
your neck

You said he interrupted that you had brought me a message from
her

Yes I stopped behind when the camp went on so as to give it She told
me to say that she has had enough of your folk and their hairsplitting
and their sluggish blood and that she wants to get back to her own
people and be free Tell him she said that I am a woman and that
I loved him and that is why I would not be his harlot any longer The
lassie was right to come away Theres no harm in a girl getting a bit
of money out of her good looks if she canthats what good looks are
for but a Romany lass has nothing to do with LOVING a man of your
race

The Gadfly stood up

Is that all the message he said Then tell her please that I think
she has done right and that I hope she will be happy That is all I
have to say Goodnight

He stood perfectly still until the garden gate closed behind her then
he sat down and covered his face with both hands

Another blow on the cheek Was no rag of pride to be left himno shred
of selfrespect Surely he had suffered everything that man can endure
his very heart had been dragged in the mud and trampled under the
feet of the passersby there was no spot in his soul where someones
contempt was not branded in where someones mockery had not left
its iron trace And now this gipsy girl whom he had picked up by the
waysideeven she had the whip in her hand

Shaitan whined at the door and the Gadfly rose to let him in The
dog rushed up to his master with his usual frantic manifestations of
delight but soon understanding that something was wrong lay down on
the rug beside him and thrust a cold nose into the listless hand

An hour later Gemma came up to the front door No one appeared in answer
to her knock Bianca finding that the Gadfly did not want any dinner
had slipped out to visit a neighbours cook She had left the door open
and a light burning in the hall Gemma after waiting for some time
decided to enter and try if she could find the Gadfly as she wished to
speak to him about an important message which had come from Bailey She
knocked at the study door and the Gadflys voice answered from within
You can go away Bianca I dont want anything

She softly opened the door The room was quite dark but the passage
lamp threw a long stream of light across it as she entered and she
saw the Gadfly sitting alone his head sunk on his breast and the dog
asleep at his feet

It is I she said

He started up Gemma Gemma Oh I have wanted you so

Before she could speak he was kneeling on the floor at her feet and
hiding his face in the folds of her dress His whole body was shaken
with a convulsive tremor that was worse to see than tears

She stood still There was nothing she could do to help himnothing
This was the bitterest thing of all She must stand by and look on
passivelyshe who would have died to spare him pain Could she but dare
to stoop and clasp her arms about him to hold him close against her
heart and shield him were it with her own body from all further harm
or wrong surely then he would be Arthur to her again surely then the
day would break and the shadows flee away

Ah no no How could he ever forget Was it not she who had cast him
into hellshe with her own right hand

She had let the moment slip by He rose hastily and sat down by the
table covering his eyes with one hand and biting his lip as if he would
bite it through

Presently he looked up and said quietly

I am afraid I startled you

She held out both her hands to him Dear she said are we not
friends enough by now for you to trust me a little bit What is it

Only a private trouble of my own I dont see why you should be worried
over it

Listen a moment she went on taking his hand in both of hers to
steady its convulsive trembling I have not tried to lay hands on a
thing that is not mine to touch But now that you have given me of your
own free will so much of your confidence will you not give me a little
moreas you would do if I were your sister Keep the mask on your face
if it is any consolation to you but dont wear a mask on your soul for
your own sake

He bent his head lower You must be patient with me he said I am
an unsatisfactory sort of brother to have Im afraid but if you only
knew I have been nearly mad this last week It has been like South
America again And somehow the devil gets into me and He broke off

May I not have my share in your trouble she whispered at last

His head sank down on her arm The hand of the Lord is heavy





PART III



CHAPTER I

THE next five weeks were spent by Gemma and the Gadfly in a whirl
of excitement and overwork which left them little time or energy for
thinking about their personal affairs When the arms had been safely
smuggled into Papal territory there remained a still more difficult and
dangerous task that of conveying them unobserved from the secret stores
in the mountain caverns and ravines to the various local centres and
thence to the separate villages The whole district was swarming with
spies and Domenichino to whom the Gadfly had intrusted the ammunition
sent into Florence a messenger with an urgent appeal for either help or
extra time The Gadfly had insisted that the work should be finished
by the middle of June and what with the difficulty of conveying heavy
transports over bad roads and the endless hindrances and delays caused
by the necessity of continually evading observation Domenichino was
growing desperate I am between Scylla and Charybdis he wrote I
dare not work quickly for fear of detection and I must not work slowly
if we are to be ready in time Either send me efficient help at once or
let the Venetians know that we shall not be ready till the first week in
July

The Gadfly carried the letter to Gemma and while she read it sat
frowning at the floor and stroking the cats fur the wrong way

This is bad she said We can hardly keep the Venetians waiting for
three weeks

Of course we cant the thing is absurd Domenichino mmight
underssstand that We must follow the lead of the Venetians not they
ours

I dont see that Domenichino is to blame he has evidently done his
best and he cant do impossibilities

Its not in Domenichino that the fault lies its in the fact of
his being one person instead of two We ought to have at least one
responsible man to guard the store and another to see the transports
off He is quite right he must have efficient help

But what help are we going to give him We have no one in Florence to
send

Then I mmust go myself

She leaned back in her chair and looked at him with a little frown

No that wont do its too risky

It will have to do if we cant fffind any other way out of the
difficulty

Then we must find another way thats all Its out of the question for
you to go again just now

An obstinate line appeared at the corners of his under lip

I ddont see that its out of the question

You will see if you think about the thing calmly for a minute It is
only five weeks since you got back the police are on the scent about
that pilgrim business and scouring the country to find a clue Yes I
know you are clever at disguises but remember what a lot of people saw
you both as Diego and as the countryman and you cant disguise your
lameness or the scar on your face

There are pplenty of lame people in the world

Yes but there are not plenty of people in the Romagna with a lame foot
and a sabrecut across the cheek and a left arm injured like yours and
the combination of blue eyes with such dark colouring

The eyes dont matter I can alter them with belladonna

You cant alter the other things No it wont do For you to go there
just now with all your identificationmarks would be to walk into a
trap with your eyes open You would certainly be taken

But sssomeone must help Domenichino

It will be no help to him to have you caught at a critical moment like
this Your arrest would mean the failure of the whole thing

But the Gadfly was difficult to convince and the discussion went on
and on without coming nearer to any settlement Gemma was beginning to
realize how nearly inexhaustible was the fund of quiet obstinacy in
his character and had the matter not been one about which she felt
strongly she would probably have yielded for the sake of peace This
however was a case in which she could not conscientiously give way the
practical advantage to be gained from the proposed journey seemed to her
not sufficiently important to be worth the risk and she could not help
suspecting that his desire to go was prompted less by a conviction of
grave political necessity than by a morbid craving for the excitement of
danger He had got into the habit of risking his neck and his tendency
to run into unnecessary peril seemed to her a form of intemperance
which should be quietly but steadily resisted Finding all her arguments
unavailing against his dogged resolve to go his own way she fired her
last shot

Let us be honest about it anyway she said and call things by
their true names It is not Domenichinos difficulty that makes you so
determined to go It is your own personal passion for

Its not true he interrupted vehemently He is nothing to me I
dont care if I never see him again

He broke off seeing in her face that he had betrayed himself Their
eyes met for an instant and dropped and neither of them uttered the
name that was in both their minds

Itit is not Domenichino I want to save he stammered at last with
his face half buried in the cats fur it is that II understand the
danger of the work failing if he has no help

She passed over the feeble little subterfuge and went on as if there
had been no interruption

It is your passion for running into danger which makes you want to go
there You have the same craving for danger when you are worried that
you had for opium when you were ill

It was not I that asked for the opium he said defiantly it was the
others who insisted on giving it to me

I dare say You plume yourself a little on your stoicism and to
ask for physical relief would have hurt your pride but it is rather
flattered than otherwise when you risk your life to relieve the
irritation of your nerves And yet after all the distinction is a
merely conventional one

He drew the cats head back and looked down into the round green eyes
Is it true Pasht he said Are all these unkind things true that
your mistress is ssaying about me Is it a case of mea culpa mea
mmaxima culpa You wise beast you never ask for opium do you Your
ancestors were gods in Egypt and no man ttrod on their tails I
wonder though what would become of your calm superiority to earthly
ills if I were to take this paw of yours and hold it in the ccandle
Would you ask me for opium then Would you Or perhapsfor death No
pussy we have no right to die for our personal convenience We may spit
and sswear a bit if it consoles us but we mustnt pull the paw away

Hush She took the cat off his knee and put it down on a footstool
You and I will have time for thinking about those things later on What
we have to think of now is how to get Domenichino out of his difficulty
What is it Katie a visitor I am busy

Miss Wright has sent you this maam by hand

The packet which was carefully sealed contained a letter addressed
to Miss Wright but unopened and with a Papal stamp Gemmas old school
friends still lived in Florence and her more important letters were
often received for safety at their address

It is Micheles mark she said glancing quickly over the letter
which seemed to be about the summerterms at a boarding house in the
Apennines and pointing to two little blots on a corner of the page
It is in chemical ink the reagent is in the third drawer of the
writingtable Yes that is it

He laid the letter open on the desk and passed a little brush over its
pages When the real message stood out on the paper in a brilliant blue
line he leaned back in his chair and burst out laughing

What is it she asked hurriedly He handed her the paper

DOMENICHINO HAS BEEN ARRESTED COME AT ONCE

She sat down with the paper in her hand and stared hopelessly at the
Gadfly

Wwell he said at last with his soft ironical drawl are you
satisfied now that I must go

Yes I suppose you must she answered sighing And I too

He looked up with a little start You too But

Of course It will be very awkward I know to be left without anyone
here in Florence but everything must go to the wall now except the
providing of an extra pair of hands

There are plenty of hands to be got there

They dont belong to people whom you can trust thoroughly though You
said yourself just now that there must be two responsible persons
in charge and if Domenichino couldnt manage alone it is evidently
impossible for you to do so A person as desperately compromised as you
are is very much handicapped remember in work of that kind and
more dependent on help than anyone else would be Instead of you and
Domenichino it must be you and I

He considered for a moment frowning

Yes you are quite right he said and the sooner we go the better
But we must not start together If I go off tonight you can take say
the afternoon coach tomorrow

Where to

That we must discuss I think I had bbbetter go straight in to
Faenza If I start late tonight and ride to Borgo San Lorenzo I can get
my disguise arranged there and go straight on

I dont see what else we can do she said with an anxious little
frown but it is very risky your going off in such a hurry and
trusting to the smugglers finding you a disguise at Borgo You ought to
have at least three clear days to double on your trace before you cross
the frontier

You neednt be afraid he answered smiling I may get taken further
on but not at the frontier Once in the hills I am as safe as here
theres not a smuggler in the Apennines that would betray me What I am
not quite sure about is how you are to get across

Oh that is very simple I shall take Louisa Wrights passport and go
for a holiday No one knows me in the Romagna but every spy knows you

Ffortunately so does every smuggler

She took out her watch

Halfpast two We have the afternoon and evening then if you are to
start tonight

Then the best thing will be for me to go home and settle everything
now and arrange about a good horse I shall ride in to San Lorenzo it
will be safer

But it wont be safe at all to hire a horse The owner will

I shant hire one I know a man that will lend me a horse and that can
be trusted He has done things for me before One of the shepherds
will bring it back in a fortnight I shall be here again by five or
halfpast then and while I am gone I wwant you to go and find
Martini and expplain everything to him

Martini She turned round and looked at him in astonishment

Yes we must take him into confidenceunless you can think of anyone
else

I dont quite understand what you mean

We must have someone here whom we can trust in case of any special
difficulty and of all the set here Martini is the man in whom I have
most confidence Riccardo would do anything he could for us of course
but I think Martini has a steadier head Still you know him better than
I do it is as you think

I have not the slightest doubt as to Martinis trustworthiness and
efficiency in every respect and I think he would probably consent to
give us any help he could But

He understood at once

Gemma what would you feel if you found out that a comrade in bitter
need had not asked you for help you might have given for fear of
hurting or distressing you Would you say there was any true kindness in
that

Very well she said after a little pause I will send Katie round at
once and ask him to come and while she is gone I will go to Louisa for
her passport she promised to lend it whenever I want one What about
money Shall I draw some out of the bank

No dont waste time on that I can draw enough from my account to last
us for a bit We will fall back on yours later on if my balance runs
short Till halfpast five then I shall be sure to find you here of
course

Oh yes I shall be back long before then

Half an hour after the appointed time he returned and found Gemma
and Martini sitting on the terrace together He saw at once that their
conversation had been a distressing one the traces of agitation were
visible in both of them and Martini was unusually silent and glum

Have you arranged everything she asked looking up

Yes and I have brought you some money for the journey The horse will
be ready for me at the Ponte Rosso barrier at one in the night

Is not that rather late You ought to get into San Lorenzo before the
people are up in the morning

So I shall its a very fast horse and I dont want to leave here
when theres a chance of anyone noticing me I shant go home any more
theres a spy watching at the door and he thinks me in

How did you get out without his seeing you

Out of the kitchen window into the back garden and over the neighbours
orchard wall thats what makes me so late I had to dodge him I left
the owner of the horse to sit in the study all the evening with the lamp
lighted When the spy sees the light in the window and a shadow on
the blind he will be quite satisfied that I am writing at home this
evening

Then you will stay here till it is time to go to the barrier

Yes I dont want to be seen in the street any more tonight Have a
cigar Martini I know Signora Bolla doesnt mind smoke

I shant be here to mind I must go downstairs and help Katie with the
dinner

When she had gone Martini got up and began to pace to and fro with his
hands behind his back The Gadfly sat smoking and looking silently out
at the drizzling rain

Rivarez Martini began stopping in front of him but keeping his eyes
on the ground what sort of thing are you going to drag her into

The Gadfly took the cigar from his mouth and blew away a long trail of
smoke

She has chosen for herself he said without compulsion on anyones
part

Yes yesI know But tell me

He stopped

I will tell you anything I can

Well thenI dont know much about the details of these affairs in the
hillsare you going to take her into any very serious danger

Do you want the truth

Yes

Thenyes

Martini turned away and went on pacing up and down Presently he stopped
again

I want to ask you another question If you dont choose to answer it
you neednt of course but if you do answer then answer honestly Are
you in love with her

The Gadfly deliberately knocked the ash from his cigar and went on
smoking in silence

That meansthat you dont choose to answer

No only that I think I have a right to know why you ask me that

Why Good God man cant you see why

Ah He laid down his cigar and looked steadily at Martini Yes he
said at last slowly and softly I am in love with her But you neednt
think I am going to make love to her or worry about it I am only going
to

His voice died away in a strange faint whisper Martini came a step
nearer

Only goingto

To die

He was staring straight before him with a cold fixed look as if he
were dead already When he spoke again his voice was curiously lifeless
and even

You neednt worry her about it beforehand he said but theres not
the ghost of a chance for me Its dangerous for everyone that she
knows as well as I do but the smugglers will do their best to prevent
her getting taken They are good fellows though they are a bit rough
As for me the rope is round my neck and when I cross the frontier I
pull the noose

Rivarez what do you mean Of course its dangerous and particularly
so for you I understand that but you have often crossed the frontier
before and always been successful

Yes and this time I shall fail

But why How can you know

The Gadfly smiled drearily

Do you remember the German legend of the man that died when he met his
own Double No It appeared to him at night in a lonely place wringing
its hands in despair Well I met mine the last time I was in the hills
and when I cross the frontier again I shant come back

Martini came up to him and put a hand on the back of his chair

Listen Rivarez I dont understand a word of all this metaphysical
stuff but I do understand one thing If you feel about it that way you
are not in a fit state to go The surest way to get taken is to go with
a conviction that you will be taken You must be ill or out of sorts
somehow to get maggots of that kind into your head Suppose I go
instead of you I can do any practical work there is to be done and you
can send a message to your men explaining

And let you get killed instead That would be very clever

Oh Im not likely to get killed They dont know me as they do you
And besides even if I did

He stopped and the Gadfly looked up with a slow inquiring gaze
Martinis hand dropped by his side

She very likely wouldnt miss me as much as she would you he said
in his most matteroffact voice And then besides Rivarez this is
public business and we have to look at it from the point of view
of utilitythe greatest good of the greatest number Your final
valueisnt that what the economists call itis higher than mine
I have brains enough to see that though I havent any cause to be
particularly fond of you You are a bigger man than I am Im not sure
that you are a better one but theres more of you and your death would
be a greater loss than mine

From the way he spoke he might have been discussing the value of shares
on the Exchange The Gadfly looked up shivering as if with cold

Would you have me wait till my grave opens of itself to swallow me up


 If I must die
 I will encounter darkness as a bride

Look here Martini you and I are talking nonsense

You are certainly said Martini gruffly

Yes and so are you For Heavens sake dont lets go in for romantic
selfsacrifice like Don Carlos and Marquis Posa This is the nineteenth
century and if its my business to die I have got to do it

And if its my business to live I have got to do that I suppose
Youre the lucky one Rivarez

Yes the Gadfly assented laconically I was always lucky

They smoked in silence for a few minutes and then began to talk of
business details When Gemma came up to call them to dinner neither of
them betrayed in face or manner that their conversation had been in any
way unusual After dinner they sat discussing plans and making necessary
arrangements till eleven oclock when Martini rose and took his hat

I will go home and fetch that ridingcloak of mine Rivarez I think
you will be less recognizable in it than in your light suit I want to
reconnoitre a bit too and make sure there are no spies about before we
start

Are you coming with me to the barrier

Yes its safer to have four eyes than two in case of anyone following
you Ill be back by twelve Be sure you dont start without me I had
better take the key Gemma so as not to wake anyone by ringing

She raised her eyes to his face as he took the keys She understood that
he had invented a pretext in order to leave her alone with the Gadfly

You and I will talk tomorrow she said We shall have time in the
morning when my packing is finished

Oh yes Plenty of time There are two or three little things I want
to ask you about Rivarez but we can talk them over on our way to the
barrier You had better send Katie to bed Gemma and be as quiet as you
can both of you Goodbye till twelve then

He went away with a little nod and smile banging the door after him to
let the neighbours hear that Signora Bollas visitor was gone

Gemma went out into the kitchen to say goodnight to Katie and came
back with black coffee on a tray

Would you like to lie down a bit she said You wont have any sleep
the rest of the night

Oh dear no I shall sleep at San Lorenzo while the men are getting my
disguise ready

Then have some coffee Wait a minute I will get you out the biscuits

As she knelt down at the sideboard he suddenly stooped over her
shoulder

Whatever have you got there Chocolate creams and English toffee Why
this is lluxury for a king

She looked up smiling faintly at his enthusiastic tone

Are you fond of sweets I always keep them for Cesare he is a perfect
baby over any kind of lollipops

Rrreally Well you must get him ssome more tomorrow and give me
these to take with me No let me ppput the toffee in my pocket it
will console me for all the lost joys of life I ddo hope theyll give
me a bit of toffee to suck the day Im hanged

Oh do let me find a cardboard box for it at least before you put it
in your pocket You will be so sticky Shall I put the chocolates in
too

No I want to eat them now with you

But I dont like chocolate and I want you to come and sit down like
a reasonable human being We very likely shant have another chance to
talk quietly before one or other of us is killed and

She dddoesnt like chocolate he murmured under his breath Then
I must be greedy all by myself This is a case of the hangmans supper
isnt it You are going to humour all my whims tonight First of all I
want you to sit on this easychair and as you said I might lie down I
shall lie here and be comfortable

He threw himself down on the rug at her feet leaning his elbow on the
chair and looking up into her face

How pale you are he said Thats because you take life sadly and
dont like chocolate

Do be serious for just five minutes After all it is a matter of life
and death

Not even for two minutes dear neither life nor death is worth it

He had taken hold of both her hands and was stroking them with the tips
of his fingers

Dont look so grave Minerva Youll make me cry in a minute and
then youll be sorry I do wish youd smile again you have such a
ddelightfully unexpected smile There now dont scold me dear Let us
eat our biscuits together like two good children without quarrelling
over themfor tomorrow we die

He took a sweet biscuit from the plate and carefully halved it breaking
the sugar ornament down the middle with scrupulous exactness

This is a kind of sacrament like what the goodygoody people have in
church Take eat this is my body And we must ddrink the wine
out of the sssame glass you knowyes that is right Do this in
remembrance

She put down the glass

Dont she said with almost a sob He looked up and took her hands
again

Hush then Let us be quiet for a little bit When one of us dies the
other will remember this We will forget this loud insistent world that
howls about our ears we will go away together hand in hand we will
go away into the secret halls of death and lie among the poppyflowers
Hush We will be quite still

He laid his head down against her knee and covered his face In the
silence she bent over him her hand on the black head So the time
slipped on and on and they neither moved nor spoke

Dear it is almost twelve she said at last He raised his head

We have only a few minutes more Martini will be back presently
Perhaps we shall never see each other again Have you nothing to say to
me

He slowly rose and walked away to the other side of the room There was
a moments silence

I have one thing to say he began in a hardly audible voice one
thingto tell you

He stopped and sat down by the window hiding his face in both hands

You have been a long time deciding to be merciful she said softly

I have not seen much mercy in my life and I thoughtat firstyou
wouldnt care

You dont think that now

She waited a moment for him to speak and then crossed the room and stood
beside him

Tell me the truth at last she whispered Think if you are killed
and I notI should have to go through all my life and never knownever
be quite sure

He took her hands and clasped them tightly

If I am killed You see when I went to South America Ah
Martini

He broke away with a violent start and threw open the door of the room
Martini was rubbing his boots on the mat

Punctual to the mmminute as usual Youre an annnimated
chronometer Martini Is that the rrridingcloak

Yes and two or three other things I have kept them as dry as I could
but its pouring with rain You will have a most uncomfortable ride Im
afraid

Oh thats no matter Is the street clear

Yes all the spies seem to have gone to bed I dont much wonder
either on such a villainous night Is that coffee Gemma He ought to
have something hot before he goes out into the wet or he will catch
cold

It is black coffee and very strong I will boil some milk

She went into the kitchen passionately clenching her teeth and hands to
keep from breaking down When she returned with the milk the Gadfly
had put on the ridingcloak and was fastening the leather gaiters which
Martini had brought He drank a cup of coffee standing and took up the
broadbrimmed riding hat

I think its time to start Martini we must make a round before we go
to the barrier in case of anything Goodbye for the present signora
I shall meet you at Forli on Friday then unless anything special turns
up Wait a minute ththis is the address

He tore a leaf out of his pocketbook and wrote a few words in pencil

I have it already she said in a dull quiet voice

Hhave you Well there it is anyway Come Martini Shshsh Dont
let the door creak

They crept softly downstairs When the street door clicked behind them
she went back into the room and mechanically unfolded the paper he had
put into her hand Underneath the address was written

I will tell you everything there



CHAPTER II

IT was marketday in Brisighella and the country folk had come in from
the villages and hamlets of the district with their pigs and poultry
their dairy produce and droves of halfwild mountain cattle The
marketplace was thronged with a perpetually shifting crowd laughing
joking bargaining for dried figs cheap cakes and sunflower seeds The
brown barefooted children sprawled face downward on the pavement in
the hot sun while their mothers sat under the trees with their baskets
of butter and eggs

Monsignor Montanelli coming out to wish the people Goodmorning was
at once surrounded by a clamourous throng of children holding up for
his acceptance great bunches of irises and scarlet poppies and sweet
white narcissus from the mountain slopes His passion for wild flowers
was affectionately tolerated by the people as one of the little follies
which sit gracefully on very wise men If anyone less universally
beloved had filled his house with weeds and grasses they would have
laughed at him but the blessed Cardinal could afford a few harmless
eccentricities

Well Mariuccia he said stopping to pat one of the children on the
head you have grown since I saw you last And how is the grandmothers
rheumatism

Shes been better lately Your Eminence but mothers bad now

Im sorry to hear that tell the mother to come down here some day and
see whether Dr Giordani can do anything for her I will find somewhere
to put her up perhaps the change will do her good You are looking
better Luigi how are your eyes

He passed on chatting with the mountaineers He always remembered
the names and ages of the children their troubles and those of their
parents and would stop to inquire with sympathetic interest for the
health of the cow that fell sick at Christmas or of the ragdoll that
was crushed under a cartwheel last marketday

When he returned to the palace the marketing began A lame man in a blue
shirt with a shock of black hair hanging into his eyes and a deep scar
across the left cheek lounged up to one of the booths and in very bad
Italian asked for a drink of lemonade

Youre not from these parts said the woman who poured it out
glancing up at him

No I come from Corsica

Looking for work

Yes it will be haycutting time soon and a gentleman that has a farm
near Ravenna came across to Bastia the other day and told me theres
plenty of work to be got there

I hope youll find it so Im sure but times are bad hereabouts

Theyre worse in Corsica mother I dont know what we poor folk are
coming to

Have you come over alone

No my mate is with me there he is in the red shirt Hola Paolo

Michele hearing himself called came lounging up with his hands in his
pockets He made a fairly good Corsican in spite of the red wig which
he had put on to render himself unrecognizable As for the Gadfly he
looked his part to perfection

They sauntered through the marketplace together Michele whistling
between his teeth and the Gadfly trudging along with a bundle over his
shoulder shuffling his feet on the ground to render his lameness
less observable They were waiting for an emissary to whom important
directions had to be given

Theres Marcone on horseback at that corner Michele whispered
suddenly The Gadfly still carrying his bundle shuffled towards the
horseman

Do you happen to be wanting a haymaker sir he said touching his
ragged cap and running one finger along the bridle It was the signal
agreed upon and the rider who from his appearance might have been a
country squires bailiff dismounted and threw the reins on the horses
neck

What sort of work can you do my man

The Gadfly fumbled with his cap

I can cut grass sir and trim hedgeshe began and without any break
in his voice went straight on At one in the morning at the mouth of
the round cave You must have two good horses and a cart I shall be
waiting inside the cave And then I can dig sir and

That will do I only want a grasscutter Have you ever been out
before

Once sir Mind you must come wellarmed we may meet a flying
squadron Dont go by the woodpath youre safer on the other side If
you meet a spy dont stop to argue with him fire at once I should
be very glad of work sir

Yes I dare say but I want an experienced grasscutter No I havent
got any coppers today

A very ragged beggar had slouched up to them with a doleful monotonous
whine

Have pity on a poor blind man in the name of the Blessed Virgin
Get out of this place at once theres a flying squadron coming
alongMost Holy Queen of Heaven Maiden undefiledIts you theyre
after Rivarez theyll be here in two minutes And so may the saints
reward you Youll have to make a dash for it there are spies at all
the corners Its no use trying to slip away without being seen

Marcone slipped the reins into the Gadflys hand

Make haste Ride out to the bridge and let the horse go you can hide
in the ravine Were all armed we can keep them back for ten minutes

No I wont have you fellows taken Stand together all of you and
fire after me in order Move up towards our horses there they are
tethered by the palace steps and have your knives ready We retreat
fighting and when I throw my cap down cut the halters and jump every
man on the nearest horse We may all reach the wood that way

They had spoken in so quiet an undertone that even the nearest
bystanders had not supposed their conversation to refer to anything
more dangerous than grasscutting Marcone leading his own mare by the
bridle walked towards the tethered horses the Gadfly slouching along
beside him and the beggar following them with an outstretched hand and
a persistent whine Michele came up whistling the beggar had warned him
in passing and he quietly handed on the news to three countrymen who
were eating raw onions under a tree They immediately rose and followed
him and before anyones notice had been attracted to them the whole
seven were standing together by the steps of the palace each man with
one hand on the hidden pistol and the tethered horses within easy
reach

Dont betray yourselves till I move the Gadfly said softly and
clearly They may not recognize us When I fire then begin in order
Dont fire at the men lame their horsesthen they cant follow us
Three of you fire while the other three reload If anyone comes between
you and our horses kill him I take the roan When I throw down my cap
each man for himself dont stop for anything

Here they come said Michele and the Gadfly turned round with an air
of naive and stupid wonder as the people suddenly broke off in their
bargaining

Fifteen armed men rode slowly into the marketplace They had great
difficulty to get past the throng of people at all and but for the
spies at the corners of the square all the seven conspirators could
have slipped quietly away while the attention of the crowd was fixed
upon the soldiers Michele moved a little closer to the Gadfly

Couldnt we get away now

No were surrounded with spies and one of them has recognized me He
has just sent a man to tell the captain where I am Our only chance is
to lame their horses

Which is the spy

The first man I fire at Are you all ready They have made a lane to
us they are going to come with a rush

Out of the way there shouted the captain In the name of His
Holiness

The crowd had drawn back startled and wondering and the soldiers made
a quick dash towards the little group standing by the palace steps The
Gadfly drew a pistol from his blouse and fired not at the advancing
troops but at the spy who was approaching the horses and who fell
back with a broken collarbone Immediately after the report six more
shots were fired in quick succession as the conspirators moved steadily
closer to the tethered horses

One of the cavalry horses stumbled and plunged another fell to
the ground with a fearful cry Then through the shrieking of the
panicstricken people came the loud imperious voice of the officer in
command who had risen in the stirrups and was holding a sword above his
head

This way men

He swayed in the saddle and sank back the Gadfly had fired again
with his deadly aim A little stream of blood was trickling down the
captains uniform but he steadied himself with a violent effort and
clutching at his horses mane cried out fiercely

Kill that lame devil if you cant take him alive Its Rivarez

Another pistol quick the Gadfly called to his men and go

He flung down his cap It was only just in time for the swords of the
now infuriated soldiers were flashing close in front of him

Put down your weapons all of you

Cardinal Montanelli had stepped suddenly between the combatants and one
of the soldiers cried out in a voice sharp with terror

Your Eminence My God youll be murdered

Montanelli only moved a step nearer and faced the Gadflys pistol

Five of the conspirators were already on horseback and dashing up the
hilly street Marcone sprang on to the back of his mare In the moment
of riding away he glanced back to see whether his leader was in need of
help The roan was close at hand and in another instant all would have
been safe but as the figure in the scarlet cassock stepped forward
the Gadfly suddenly wavered and the hand with the pistol sank down
The instant decided everything Immediately he was surrounded and flung
violently to the ground and the weapon was dashed out of his hand by a
blow from the flat of a soldiers sword Marcone struck his mares flank
with the stirrup the hoofs of the cavalry horses were thundering up the
hill behind him and it would have been worse than useless to stay and
be taken too Turning in the saddle as he galloped away to fire a last
shot in the teeth of the nearest pursuer he saw the Gadfly with blood
on his face trampled under the feet of horses and soldiers and spies
and heard the savage curses of the captors the yells of triumph and
rage

Montanelli did not notice what had happened he had moved away from the
steps and was trying to calm the terrified people Presently as he
stooped over the wounded spy a startled movement of the crowd made him
look up The soldiers were crossing the square dragging their prisoner
after them by the rope with which his hands were tied His face was
livid with pain and exhaustion and he panted fearfully for breath but
he looked round at the Cardinal smiling with white lips and whispered

I cconggratulate your Eminence

 

Five days later Martini reached Forli He had received from Gemma by
post a bundle of printed circulars the signal agreed upon in case
of his being needed in any special emergency and remembering the
conversation on the terrace he guessed the truth at once All through
the journey he kept repeating to himself that there was no reason for
supposing anything to have happened to the Gadfly and that it was
absurd to attach any importance to the childish superstitions of so
nervous and fanciful a person but the more he reasoned with himself
against the idea the more firmly did it take possession of his mind

I have guessed what it is Rivarez is taken of course he said as he
came into Gemmas room

He was arrested last Thursday at Brisighella He defended himself
desperately and wounded the captain of the squadron and a spy

Armed resistance thats bad

It makes no difference he was too deeply compromised already for a
pistolshot more or less to affect his position much

What do you think they are going to do with him

She grew a shade paler even than before

I think she said that we must not wait to find out what they mean
to do

You think we shall be able to effect a rescue

We MUST

He turned away and began to whistle with his hands behind his back
Gemma let him think undisturbed She was sitting still leaning her head
against the back of the chair and looking out into vague distance with
a fixed and tragic absorption When her face wore that expression it
had a look of Durers Melancolia

Have you seen him Martini asked stopping for a moment in his tramp

No he was to have met me here the next morning

Yes I remember Where is he

In the fortress very strictly guarded and they say in chains

He made a gesture of indifference

Oh thats no matter a good file will get rid of any number of chains
If only he isnt wounded

He seems to have been slightly hurt but exactly how much we dont
know I think you had better hear the account of it from Michele
himself he was present at the arrest

How does he come not to have been taken too Did he run away and leave
Rivarez in the lurch

Its not his fault he fought as long as anybody did and followed the
directions given him to the letter For that matter so did they all
The only person who seems to have forgotten or somehow made a mistake
at the last minute is Rivarez himself Theres something inexplicable
about it altogether Wait a moment I will call Michele

She went out of the room and presently came back with Michele and a
broadshouldered mountaineer

This is Marco she said You have heard of him he is one of the
smugglers He has just got here and perhaps will be able to tell us
more Michele this is Cesare Martini that I spoke to you about Will
you tell him what happened as far as you saw it

Michele gave a short account of the skirmish with the squadron

I cant understand how it happened he concluded Not one of us would
have left him if we had thought he would be taken but his directions
were quite precise and it never occurred to us when he threw down his
cap that he would wait to let them surround him He was close beside
the roanI saw him cut the tetherand I handed him a loaded pistol
myself before I mounted The only thing I can suppose is that he missed
his footingbeing lamein trying to mount But even then he could
have fired

No it wasnt that Marcone interposed He didnt attempt to mount
I was the last one to go because my mare shied at the firing and I
looked round to see whether he was safe He would have got off clear if
it hadnt been for the Cardinal

Ah Gemma exclaimed softly and Martini repeated in amazement The
Cardinal

Yes he threw himself in front of the pistolconfound him I suppose
Rivarez must have been startled for he dropped his pistolhand and put
the other one up like thislaying the back of his left wrist across
his eyesand of course they all rushed on him

I cant make that out said Michele Its not like Rivarez to lose
his head at a crisis

Probably he lowered his pistol for fear of killing an unarmed man
Martini put in Michele shrugged his shoulders

Unarmed men shouldnt poke their noses into the middle of a fight
War is war If Rivarez had put a bullet into His Eminence instead of
letting himself be caught like a tame rabbit thered be one honest man
the more and one priest the less

He turned away biting his moustache His anger was very near to
breaking down in tears

Anyway said Martini the things done and theres no use wasting
time in discussing how it happened The question now is how were to
arrange an escape for him I suppose youre all willing to risk it

Michele did not even condescend to answer the superfluous question
and the smuggler only remarked with a little laugh Id shoot my own
brother if he werent willing

Very well then First thing have you got a plan of the fortress

Gemma unlocked a drawer and took out several sheets of paper

I have made out all the plans Here is the ground floor of the
fortress here are the upper and lower stories of the towers and here
the plan of the ramparts These are the roads leading to the valley
and here are the paths and hidingplaces in the mountains and the
underground passages

Do you know which of the towers he is in

The east one in the round room with the grated window I have marked
it on the plan

How did you get your information

From a man nicknamed The Cricket a soldier of the guard He is
cousin to one of our menGino

You have been quick about it

Theres no time to lose Gino went into Brisighella at once and some
of the plans we already had That list of hidingplaces was made by
Rivarez himself you can see by the handwriting

What sort of men are the soldiers of the guard

That we have not been able to find out yet the Cricket has only just
come to the place and knows nothing about the other men

We must find out from Gino what the Cricket himself is like Is
anything known of the governments intentions Is Rivarez likely to be
tried in Brisighella or taken in to Ravenna

That we dont know Ravenna of course is the chief town of the
Legation and by law cases of importance can be tried only there in the
Tribunal of First Instance But law doesnt count for much in the Four
Legations it depends on the personal fancy of anybody who happens to be
in power

They wont take him in to Ravenna Michele interposed

What makes you think so

I am sure of it Colonel Ferrari the military Governor at Brisighella
is uncle to the officer that Rivarez wounded hes a vindictive sort of
brute and wont give up a chance to spite an enemy

You think he will try to keep Rivarez here

I think he will try to get him hanged

Martini glanced quickly at Gemma She was very pale but her face had
not changed at the words Evidently the idea was no new one to her

He can hardly do that without some formality she said quietly but
he might possibly get up a courtmartial on some pretext or other and
justify himself afterwards by saying that the peace of the town required
it

But what about the Cardinal Would he consent to things of that kind

He has no jurisdiction in military affairs

No but he has great influence Surely the Governor would not venture
on such a step without his consent

Hell never get that Marcone interrupted Montanelli was always
against the military commissions and everything of the kind So long
as they keep him in Brisighella nothing serious can happen the Cardinal
will always take the part of any prisoner What I am afraid of is their
taking him to Ravenna Once there hes lost

We shouldnt let him get there said Michele We could manage a
rescue on the road but to get him out of the fortress here is another
matter

I think said Gemma that it would be quite useless to wait for the
chance of his being transferred to Ravenna We must make the attempt at
Brisighella and we have no time to lose Cesare you and I had better
go over the plan of the fortress together and see whether we can
think out anything I have an idea in my head but I cant get over one
point

Come Marcone said Michele rising we will leave them to think out
their scheme I have to go across to Fognano this afternoon and I want
you to come with me Vincenzo hasnt sent those cartridges and they
ought to have been here yesterday

When the two men had gone Martini went up to Gemma and silently held
out his hand She let her fingers lie in his for a moment

You were always a good friend Cesare she said at last and a very
present help in trouble And now let us discuss plans



CHAPTER III

AND I once more most earnestly assure Your Eminence that your refusal
is endangering the peace of the town

The Governor tried to preserve the respectful tone due to a high
dignitary of the Church but there was audible irritation in his voice
His liver was out of order his wife was running up heavy bills and
his temper had been sorely tried during the last three weeks A sullen
disaffected populace whose dangerous mood grew daily more apparent a
district honeycombed with plots and bristling with hidden weapons an
inefficient garrison of whose loyalty he was more than doubtful and
a Cardinal whom he had pathetically described to his adjutant as the
incarnation of immaculate pigheadedness had already reduced him
to the verge of desperation Now he was saddled with the Gadfly an
animated quintessence of the spirit of mischief

Having begun by disabling both the Governors favourite nephew and
his most valuable spy the crooked Spanish devil had followed up his
exploits in the marketplace by suborning the guards browbeating the
interrogating officers and turning the prison into a beargarden
He had now been three weeks in the fortress and the authorities of
Brisighella were heartily sick of their bargain They had subjected
him to interrogation upon interrogation and after employing to obtain
admissions from him every device of threat persuasion and stratagem
which their ingenuity could suggest remained just as wise as on the
day of his capture They had begun to realize that it would perhaps have
been better to send him into Ravenna at once It was however too late
to rectify the mistake The Governor when sending in to the Legate his
report of the arrest had begged as a special favour permission to
superintend personally the investigation of this case and his request
having been graciously acceded to he could not now withdraw without a
humiliating confession that he was overmatched

The idea of settling the difficulty by a courtmartial had as Gemma and
Michele had foreseen presented itself to him as the only satisfactory
solution and Cardinal Montanellis stubborn refusal to countenance this
was the last drop which made the cup of his vexations overflow

I think he said that if Your Eminence knew what I and my assistants
have put up with from this man you would feel differently about the
matter I fully understand and respect the conscientious objection to
irregularities in judicial proceedings but this is an exceptional case
and calls for exceptional measures

There is no case Montanelli answered which calls for injustice and
to condemn a civilian by the judgment of a secret military tribunal is
both unjust and illegal

The case amounts to this Your Eminence The prisoner is manifestly
guilty of several capital crimes He joined the infamous attempt of
Savigno and the military commission nominated by Monsignor Spinola
would certainly have had him shot or sent to the galleys then had
he not succeeded in escaping to Tuscany Since that time he has never
ceased plotting He is known to be an influential member of one of the
most pestilent secret societies in the country He is gravely suspected
of having consented to if not inspired the assassination of no less
than three confidential police agents He has been caughtone might
almost sayin the act of smuggling firearms into the Legation He
has offered armed resistance to authority and seriously wounded two
officials in the discharge of their duty and he is now a standing
menace to the peace and order of the town Surely in such a case a
courtmartial is justifiable

Whatever the man has done Montanelli replied he has the right to be
judged according to law

The ordinary course of law involves delay Your Eminence and in this
case every moment is precious Besides everything else I am in constant
terror of his escaping

If there is any danger of that it rests with you to guard him more
closely

I do my best Your Eminence but I am dependent upon the prison staff
and the man seems to have bewitched them all I have changed the guard
four times within three weeks I have punished the soldiers till I am
tired of it and nothing is of any use I cant prevent their carrying
letters backwards and forwards The fools are in love with him as if he
were a woman

That is very curious There must be something remarkable about him

Theres a remarkable amount of devilryI beg pardon Your Eminence
but really this man is enough to try the patience of a saint Its
hardly credible but I have to conduct all the interrogations myself
for the regular officer cannot stand it any longer

How is that

Its difficult to explain Your Eminence but you would understand if
you had once heard the way he goes on One might think the interrogating
officer were the criminal and he the judge

But what is there so terrible that he can do He can refuse to answer
your questions of course but he has no weapon except silence

And a tongue like a razor We are all mortal Your Eminence and most
of us have made mistakes in our time that we dont want published on the
housetops Thats only human nature and its hard on a man to have his
little slips of twenty years ago raked up and thrown in his teeth

Has Rivarez brought up some personal secret of the interrogating
officer

Well reallythe poor fellow got into debt when he was a cavalry
officer and borrowed a little sum from the regimental funds

Stole public money that had been intrusted to him in fact

Of course it was very wrong Your Eminence but his friends paid
it back at once and the affair was hushed uphe comes of a good
familyand ever since then he has been irreproachable How Rivarez
found out about it I cant conceive but the first thing he did at
interrogation was to bring up this old scandalbefore the subaltern
too And with as innocent a face as if he were saying his prayers Of
course the storys all over the Legation by now If Your Eminence
would only be present at one of the interrogations I am sure you would
realize He neednt know anything about it You might overhear him
from

Montanelli turned round and looked at the Governor with an expression
which his face did not often wear

I am a minister of religion he said not a policespy and
eavesdropping forms no part of my professional duties

II didnt mean to give offence

I think we shall not get any good out of discussing this question
further If you will send the prisoner here I will have a talk with
him

I venture very respectfully to advise Your Eminence not to attempt it
The man is perfectly incorrigible It would be both safer and wiser to
overstep the letter of the law for this once and get rid of him before
he does any more mischief It is with great diffidence that I venture
to press the point after what Your Eminence has said but after all I am
responsible to Monsignor the Legate for the order of the town

And I Montanelli interrupted am responsible to God and His Holiness
that there shall be no underhand dealing in my diocese Since you
press me in the matter colonel I take my stand upon my privilege
as Cardinal I will not allow a secret courtmartial in this town
in peacetime I will receive the prisoner here and alone at ten
tomorrow morning

As Your Eminence pleases the Governor replied with sulky
respectfulness and went away grumbling to himself Theyre about a
pair as far as obstinacy goes

He told no one of the approaching interview till it was actually time to
knock off the prisoners chains and start for the palace It was quite
enough as he remarked to his wounded nephew to have this Most Eminent
son of Balaams ass laying down the law without running any risk of the
soldiers plotting with Rivarez and his friends to effect an escape on
the way

When the Gadfly strongly guarded entered the room where Montanelli was
writing at a table covered with papers a sudden recollection came
over him of a hot midsummer afternoon when he had sat turning over
manuscript sermons in a study much like this The shutters had been
closed as they were here to keep out the heat and a fruitsellers
voice outside had called Fragola Fragola

He shook the hair angrily back from his eyes and set his mouth in a
smile

Montanelli looked up from his papers

You can wait in the hall he said to the guards

May it please Your Eminence began the sergeant in a lowered voice
and with evident nervousness the colonel thinks that this prisoner is
dangerous and that it would be better

A sudden flash came into Montanellis eyes

You can wait in the hall he repeated quietly and the sergeant
saluting and stammering excuses with a frightened face left the room
with his men

Sit down please said the Cardinal when the door was shut The
Gadfly obeyed in silence

Signor Rivarez Montanelli began after a pause I wish to ask you a
few questions and shall be very much obliged to you if you will answer
them

The Gadfly smiled My chchchief occupation at pppresent is to be
asked questions

Andnot to answer them So I have heard but these questions are put
by officials who are investigating your case and whose duty is to use
your answers as evidence

And ththose of Your Eminence There was a covert insult in the tone
more than in the words and the Cardinal understood it at once but his
face did not lose its grave sweetness of expression

Mine he said whether you answer them or not will remain between
you and me If they should trench upon your political secrets of course
you will not answer Otherwise though we are complete strangers to each
other I hope that you will do so as a personal favour to me

I am entttirely at the service of Your Eminence He said it with a
little bow and a face that would have taken the heart to ask favours
out of the daughters of the horseleech

First then you are said to have been smuggling firearms into this
district What are they wanted for

Ttto kkkill rats with

That is a terrible answer Are all your fellowmen rats in your eyes if
they cannot think as you do

Sssome of them

Montanelli leaned back in his chair and looked at him in silence for a
little while

What is that on your hand he asked suddenly

The Gadfly glanced at his left hand Old mmmarks from the teeth of
some of the rats

Excuse me I was speaking of the other hand That is a fresh hurt

The slender flexible right hand was badly cut and grazed The Gadfly
held it up The wrist was swollen and across it ran a deep and long
black bruise

It is a mmmere trifle as you see he said When I was arrested the
other daythanks to Your Eminencehe made another little bowone
of the soldiers stamped on it

Montanelli took the wrist and examined it closely How does it come
to be in such a state now after three weeks he asked It is all
inflamed

Possibly the pppressure of the iron has not done it much good

The Cardinal looked up with a frown

Have they been putting irons on a fresh wound

Nnnaturally Your Eminence that is what fresh wounds are for Old
wounds are not much use They will only ache you cccant make them
burn properly

Montanelli looked at him again in the same close scrutinizing way then
rose and opened a drawer full of surgical appliances

Give me the hand he said

The Gadfly with a face as hard as beaten iron held out the hand
and Montanelli after bathing the injured place gently bandaged it
Evidently he was accustomed to such work

I will speak about the irons he said And now I want to ask you
another question What do you propose to do

Thththat is very simply answered Your Eminence To escape if I can
and if I cant to die

Why to die

Because if the Governor doesnt succeed in getting me shot I shall be
sent to the galleys and for me that cccomes to the same thing I have
not got the health to live through it

Montanelli rested his arm on the table and pondered silently The Gadfly
did not disturb him He was leaning back with halfshut eyes lazily
enjoying the delicious physical sensation of relief from the chains

Supposing Montanelli began again that you were to succeed in
escaping what should you do with your life

I have already told Your Eminence I should kkkill rats

You would kill rats That is to say that if I were to let you escape
from here nowsupposing I had the power to do soyou would use your
freedom to foster violence and bloodshed instead of preventing them

The Gadfly raised his eyes to the crucifix on the wall Not peace
but a swordat lleast I should be in good company For my own part
though I prefer pistols

Signor Rivarez said the Cardinal with unruffled composure I have
not insulted you as yet or spoken slightingly of your beliefs or
friends May I not expect the same courtesy from you or do you wish me
to suppose that an atheist cannot be a gentleman

Ah I qquite forgot Your Eminence places courtesy high among the
Christian virtues I remember your sermon in Florence on the occasion
of my ccontroversy with your anonymous defender

That is one of the subjects about which I wished to speak to you Would
you mind explaining to me the reason of the peculiar bitterness you seem
to feel against me If you have simply picked me out as a convenient
target that is another matter Your methods of political controversy
are your own affair and we are not discussing politics now But I
fancied at the time that there was some personal animosity towards me
and if so I should be glad to know whether I have ever done you wrong
or in any way given you cause for such a feeling

Ever done him wrong The Gadfly put up the bandaged hand to his throat
I must refer Your Eminence to Shakspere he said with a little laugh
Its as with the man who cant endure a harmless necessary cat My
antipathy is a priest The sight of the cassock makes my ttteeth
ache

Oh if it is only that Montanelli dismissed the subject with an
indifferent gesture

Still he added abuse is one thing and perversion of fact is
another When you stated in answer to my sermon that I knew the
identity of the anonymous writer you made a mistakeI do not accuse
you of wilful falsehoodand stated what was untrue I am to this day
quite ignorant of his name

The Gadfly put his head on one side like an intelligent robin looked
at him for a moment gravely then suddenly threw himself back and burst
into a peal of laughter

Sssancta simplicitas Oh you sweet innocent Arcadian peopleand
you never guessed You nnever saw the cloven hoof

Montanelli stood up Am I to understand Signor Rivarez that you wrote
both sides of the controversy yourself

It was a shame I know the Gadfly answered looking up with wide
innocent blue eyes And you ssswallowed everything whole just as if
it had been an oyster It was very wrong but oh it wwwas so funny

Montanelli bit his lip and sat down again He had realized from the
first that the Gadfly was trying to make him lose his temper and had
resolved to keep it whatever happened but he was beginning to find
excuses for the Governors exasperation A man who had been spending two
hours a day for the last three weeks in interrogating the Gadfly might
be pardoned an occasional swearword

We will drop that subject he said quietly What I wanted to see you
for particularly is this My position here as Cardinal gives me some
voice if I choose to claim my privilege in the question of what is
to be done with you The only use to which I should ever put such a
privilege would be to interfere in case of any violence to you which was
not necessary to prevent you from doing violence to others I sent for
you therefore partly in order to ask whether you have anything to
complain ofI will see about the irons but perhaps there is something
elseand partly because I felt it right before giving my opinion to
see for myself what sort of man you are

I have nothing to complain of Your Eminence A la guerre comme a la
guerre I am not a schoolboy to expect any government to pat me on the
head for sssmuggling firearms onto its territory Its only natural
that they should hit as hard as they can As for what sort of man I am
you have had a romantic confession of my sins once Is not that enough
or wwwould you like me to begin again

I dont understand you Montanelli said coldly taking up a pencil and
twisting it between his fingers

Surely Your Eminence has not forgotten old Diego the pilgrim
He suddenly changed his voice and began to speak as Diego I am a
miserable sinner

The pencil snapped in Montanellis hand That is too much he said

The Gadfly leaned his head back with a soft little laugh and sat
watching while the Cardinal paced silently up and down the room

Signor Rivarez said Montanelli stopping at last in front of him
you have done a thing to me that a man who was born of a woman should
hesitate to do to his worst enemy You have stolen in upon my private
grief and have made for yourself a mock and a jest out of the sorrow
of a fellowman I once more beg you to tell me Have I ever done you
wrong And if not why have you played this heartless trick on me

The Gadfly leaning back against the chaircushions looked up with his
subtle chilling inscrutable smile

It ammmused me Your Eminence you took it all so much to heart and
it remmminded mea little bitof a variety show

Montanelli white to the very lips turned away and rang the bell

You can take back the prisoner he said when the guards came in

After they had gone he sat down at the table still trembling with
unaccustomed indignation and took up a pile of reports which had been
sent in to him by the parish priests of his diocese

Presently he pushed them away and leaning on the table hid his face
in both hands The Gadfly seemed to have left some terrible shadow of
himself some ghostly trail of his personality to haunt the room and
Montanelli sat trembling and cowering not daring to look up lest he
should see the phantom presence that he knew was not there The spectre
hardly amounted to a hallucination It was a mere fancy of overwrought
nerves but he was seized with an unutterable dread of its shadowy
presenceof the wounded hand the smiling cruel mouth the mysterious
eyes like deep sea water

He shook off the fancy and settled to his work All day long he had
scarcely a free moment and the thing did not trouble him but going
into his bedroom late at night he stopped on the threshold with a
sudden shock of fear What if he should see it in a dream He recovered
himself immediately and knelt down before the crucifix to pray

But he lay awake the whole night through



CHAPTER IV

MONTANELLIS anger did not make him neglectful of his promise He
protested so emphatically against the manner in which the Gadfly had
been chained that the unfortunate Governor who by now was at his wits
end knocked off all the fetters in the recklessness of despair How am
I to know he grumbled to the adjutant what His Eminence will object
to next If he calls a simple pair of handcuffs cruelty hell be
exclaiming against the windowbars presently or wanting me to feed
Rivarez on oysters and truffles In my young days malefactors were
malefactors and were treated accordingly and nobody thought a traitor
any better than a thief But its the fashion to be seditious nowadays
and His Eminence seems inclined to encourage all the scoundrels in the
country

I dont see what business he has got to interfere at all the adjutant
remarked He is not a Legate and has no authority in civil and military
affairs By law

What is the use of talking about law You cant expect anyone to
respect laws after the Holy Father has opened the prisons and turned the
whole crew of Liberal scamps loose on us Its a positive infatuation
Of course Monsignor Montanelli will give himself airs he was quiet
enough under His Holiness the late Pope but hes cock of the walk now
He has jumped into favour all at once and can do as he pleases How am
I to oppose him He may have secret authorization from the Vatican for
all I know Everythings topsyturvy now you cant tell from day to day
what may happen next In the good old times one knew what to be at but
nowadays

The Governor shook his head ruefully A world in which Cardinals
troubled themselves over trifles of prison discipline and talked about
the rights of political offenders was a world that was growing too
complex for him

The Gadfly for his part had returned to the fortress in a state of
nervous excitement bordering on hysteria The meeting with Montanelli
had strained his endurance almost to breakingpoint and his final
brutality about the variety show had been uttered in sheer desperation
merely to cut short an interview which in another five minutes would
have ended in tears

Called up for interrogation in the afternoon of the same day he did
nothing but go into convulsions of laughter at every question put to
him and when the Governor worried out of all patience lost his temper
and began to swear he only laughed more immoderately than ever
The unlucky Governor fumed and stormed and threatened his refractory
prisoner with impossible punishments but finally came as James Burton
had come long ago to the conclusion that it was mere waste of breath
and temper to argue with a person in so unreasonable a state of mind

The Gadfly was once more taken back to his cell and there lay down upon
the pallet in the mood of black and hopeless depression which always
succeeded to his boisterous fits He lay till evening without moving
without even thinking he had passed after the vehement emotion of the
morning into a strange halfapathetic state in which his own misery
was hardly more to him than a dull and mechanical weight pressing on
some wooden thing that had forgotten to be a soul In truth it was of
little consequence how all ended the one thing that mattered to any
sentient being was to be spared unbearable pain and whether the relief
came from altered conditions or from the deadening of the power to
feel was a question of no moment Perhaps he would succeed in escaping
perhaps they would kill him in any case he should never see the Padre
again and it was all vanity and vexation of spirit

One of the warders brought in supper and the Gadfly looked up with
heavyeyed indifference

What time is it

Six oclock Your supper sir

He looked with disgust at the stale foulsmelling halfcold mess and
turned his head away He was feeling bodily ill as well as depressed
and the sight of the food sickened him

You will be ill if you dont eat said the soldier hurriedly Take a
bit of bread anyway itll do you good

The man spoke with a curious earnestness of tone lifting a piece
of sodden bread from the plate and putting it down again All the
conspirator awoke in the Gadfly he had guessed at once that there was
something hidden in the bread

You can leave it Ill eat a bit by and by he said carelessly The
door was open and he knew that the sergeant on the stairs could hear
every word spoken between them

When the door was locked on him again and he had satisfied himself that
no one was watching at the spyhole he took up the piece of bread and
carefully crumbled it away In the middle was the thing he had expected
a bundle of small files It was wrapped in a bit of paper on which a
few words were written He smoothed the paper out carefully and carried
it to what little light there was The writing was crowded into so
narrow a space and on such thin paper that it was very difficult to
read


The door is unlocked and there is no moon Get the filing done as fast
as possible and come by the passage between two and three We are quite
ready and may not have another chance


He crushed the paper feverishly in his hand All the preparations were
ready then and he had only to file the window bars how lucky it was
that the chains were off He need not stop about filing them How many
bars were there Two four and each must be filed in two places eight
Oh he could manage that in the course of the night if he made
haste How had Gemma and Martini contrived to get everything ready so
quicklydisguises passports hidingplaces They must have worked like
carthorses to do it And it was her plan that had been adopted after
all He laughed a little to himself at his own foolishness as if it
mattered whether the plan was hers or not once it was a good one And
yet he could not help being glad that it was she who had struck on
the idea of his utilizing the subterranean passage instead of letting
himself down by a ropeladder as the smugglers had at first suggested
Hers was the more complex and difficult plan but did not involve as
the other did a risk to the life of the sentinel on duty outside the
east wall Therefore when the two schemes had been laid before him he
had unhesitatingly chosen Gemmas

The arrangement was that the friendly guard who went by the nickname of
The Cricket should seize the first opportunity of unlocking without
the knowledge of his fellows the iron gate leading from the courtyard
into the subterranean passage underneath the ramparts and should then
replace the key on its nail in the guardroom The Gadfly on receiving
information of this was to file through the bars of his window tear
his shirt into strips and plait them into a rope by means of which he
could let himself down on to the broad east wall of the courtyard Along
this wall he was to creep on hands and knees while the sentinel was
looking in the opposite direction lying flat upon the masonry whenever
the man turned towards him At the southeast corner was a halfruined
turret It was upheld to some extent by a thick growth of ivy
but great masses of crumbling stone had fallen inward and lay in the
courtyard heaped against the wall From this turret he was to climb
down by the ivy and the heaps of stone into the courtyard and softly
opening the unlocked gate to make his way along the passage to a
subterranean tunnel communicating with it Centuries ago this tunnel
had formed a secret corridor between the fortress and a tower on the
neighbouring hill now it was quite disused and blocked in many places
by the falling in of the rocks No one but the smugglers knew of a
certain carefullyhidden hole in the mountainside which they had
bored through to the tunnel no one suspected that stores of forbidden
merchandise were often kept for weeks together under the very ramparts
of the fortress itself while the customsofficers were vainly searching
the houses of the sullen wrathfuleyed mountaineers At this hole the
Gadfly was to creep out on to the hillside and make his way in the dark
to a lonely spot where Martini and a smuggler would be waiting for him
The one great difficulty was that opportunities to unlock the gate after
the evening patrol did not occur every night and the descent from the
window could not be made in very clear weather without too great a risk
of being observed by the sentinel Now that there was really a fair
chance of success it must not be missed

He sat down and began to eat some of the bread It at least did not
disgust him like the rest of the prison food and he must eat something
to keep up his strength

He had better lie down a bit too and try to get a little sleep it
would not be safe to begin filing before ten oclock and he would have
a hard nights work

And so after all the Padre had been thinking of letting him escape
That was like the Padre But he for his part would never consent to
it Anything rather than that If he escaped it should be his own doing
and that of his comrades he would have no favours from priests

How hot it was Surely it must be going to thunder the air was so close
and oppressive He moved restlessly on the pallet and put the bandaged
right hand behind his head for a pillow then drew it away again How it
burned and throbbed And all the old wounds were beginning to ache with
a dull faint persistence What was the matter with them Oh absurd
It was only the thundery weather He would go to sleep and get a little
rest before beginning his filing

Eight bars and all so thick and strong How many more were there
left to file Surely not many He must have been filing for
hoursinterminable hoursyes of course that was what made his arm
ache And how it ached right through to the very bone But it could
hardly be the filing that made his side ache so and the throbbing
burning pain in the lame legwas that from filing

He started up No he had not been asleep he had been dreaming with
open eyesdreaming of filing and it was all still to do There stood
the windowbars untouched strong and firm as ever And there was ten
striking from the clocktower in the distance He must get to work

He looked through the spyhole and seeing that no one was watching
took one of the files from his breast

 

No there was nothing the matter with himnothing It was all
imagination The pain in his side was indigestion or a chill or some
such thing not much wonder after three weeks of this insufferable
prison food and air As for the aching and throbbing all over it was
partly nervous trouble and partly want of exercise Yes that was it no
doubt want of exercise How absurd not to have thought of that before

He would sit down a little bit though and let it pass before he got to
work It would be sure to go over in a minute or two

To sit still was worse than all When he sat still he was at its mercy
and his face grew gray with fear No he must get up and set to work
and shake it off It should depend upon his will to feel or not to feel
and he would not feel he would force it back

He stood up again and spoke to himself aloud and distinctly

I am not ill I have no time to be ill I have those bars to file and
I am not going to be ill

Then he began to file

A quarterpast tenhalfpast tena quarter to eleven He filed and
filed and every grating scrape of the iron was as though someone were
filing on his body and brain I wonder which will be filed through
first he said to himself with a little laugh I or the bars And he
set his teeth and went on filing

Halfpast eleven He was still filing though the hand was stiff and
swollen and would hardly grasp the tool No he dared not stop to rest
if he once put the horrible thing down he should never have the courage
to begin again

The sentinel moved outside the door and the butt end of his carbine
scratched against the lintel The Gadfly stopped and looked round the
file still in his lifted hand Was he discovered

A little round pellet had been shot through the spyhole and was lying
on the floor He laid down the file and stooped to pick up the round
thing It was a bit of rolled paper

 

It was a long way to go down and down with the black waves rushing
about himhow they roared

Ah yes He was only stooping down to pick up the paper He was a bit
giddy many people are when they stoop There was nothing the matter
with himnothing

He picked it up carried it to the light and unfolded it steadily


Come tonight whatever happens the Cricket will be transferred
tomorrow to another service This is our only chance


He destroyed the paper as he had done the former one picked up his file
again and went back to work dogged and mute and desperate

One oclock He had been working for three hours now and six of the
eight bars were filed Two more and then to climb

He began to recall the former occasions when these terrible attacks had
come on The last had been the one at New Year and he shuddered as
he remembered those five nights But that time it had not come on so
suddenly he had never known it so sudden

He dropped the file and flung out both hands blindly praying in his
utter desperation for the first time since he had been an atheist
praying to anythingto nothingto everything

Not tonight Oh let me be ill tomorrow I will bear anything
tomorrowonly not tonight

He stood still for a moment with both hands up to his temples then he
took up the file once more and once more went back to his work

Halfpast one He had begun on the last bar His shirtsleeve was bitten
to rags there was blood on his lips and a red mist before his eyes and
the sweat poured from his forehead as he filed and filed and filed

 

After sunrise Montanelli fell asleep He was utterly worn out with the
restless misery of the night and slept for a little while quietly then
he began to dream

At first he dreamed vaguely confusedly broken fragments of images and
fancies followed each other fleeting and incoherent but all filled
with the same dim sense of struggle and pain the same shadow of
indefinable dread Presently he began to dream of sleeplessness the
old frightful familiar dream that had been a terror to him for years
And even as he dreamed he recognized that he had been through it all
before

He was wandering about in a great empty place trying to find some quiet
spot where he could lie down and sleep Everywhere there were people
walking up and down talking laughing shouting praying ringing
bells and clashing metal instruments together Sometimes he would get
away to a little distance from the noise and would lie down now on the
grass now on a wooden bench now on some slab of stone He would shut
his eyes and cover them with both hands to keep out the light and would
say to himself Now I will get to sleep Then the crowds would come
sweeping up to him shouting yelling calling him by name begging him
Wake up Wake up quick we want you

Again he was in a great palace full of gorgeous rooms with beds and
couches and low soft lounges It was night and he said to himself
Here at last I shall find a quiet place to sleep But when he chose
a dark room and lay down someone came in with a lamp flashing the
merciless light into his eyes and said Get up you are wanted

He rose and wandered on staggering and stumbling like a creature
wounded to death and heard the clocks strike one and knew that half
the night was gone alreadythe precious night that was so short Two
three four fiveby six oclock the whole town would wake up and there
would be no more silence

He went into another room and would have lain down on a bed but someone
started up from the pillows crying out This bed is mine and he
shrank away with despair in his heart

Hour after hour struck and still he wandered on and on from room to
room from house to house from corridor to corridor The horrible gray
dawn was creeping near and nearer the clocks were striking five
the night was gone and he had found no rest Oh misery Another
dayanother day

He was in a long subterranean corridor a low vaulted passage
that seemed to have no end It was lighted with glaring lamps and
chandeliers and through its grated roof came the sounds of dancing
and laughter and merry music Up there in the world of the live people
overhead there was some festival no doubt Oh for a place to hide
and sleep some little place were it even a grave And as he spoke
he stumbled over an open grave An open grave smelling of death and
rottenness Ah what matter so he could but sleep

This grave is mine It was Gladys and she raised her head and stared
at him over the rotting shroud Then he knelt down and stretched out his
arms to her

Gladys Gladys Have a little pity on me let me creep into this narrow
space and sleep I do not ask you for your love I will not touch you
will not speak to you only let me lie down beside you and sleep Oh
love it is so long since I have slept I cannot bear another day The
light glares in upon my soul the noise is beating my brain to dust
Gladys let me come in here and sleep

And he would have drawn her shroud across his eyes But she shrank away
screaming

It is sacrilege you are a priest

On and on he wandered and came out upon the seashore on the barren
rocks where the fierce light struck down and the water moaned its low
perpetual wail of unrest Ah he said the sea will be more merciful
it too is wearied unto death and cannot sleep

Then Arthur rose up from the deep and cried aloud

This sea is mine

 

Your Eminence Your Eminence

Montanelli awoke with a start His servant was knocking at the door He
rose mechanically and opened it and the man saw how wild and scared he
looked

Your Eminenceare you ill

He drew both hands across his forehead

No I was asleep and you startled me

I am very sorry I thought I had heard you moving early this morning
and I supposed

Is it late now

It is nine oclock and the Governor has called He says he has
very important business and knowing Your Eminence to be an early
riser

Is he downstairs I will come presently

He dressed and went downstairs

I am afraid this is an unceremonious way to call upon Your Eminence
the Governor began

I hope there is nothing the matter

There is very much the matter Rivarez has all but succeeded in
escaping

Well so long as he has not quite succeeded there is no harm done How
was it

He was found in the courtyard right against the little iron gate
When the patrol came in to inspect the courtyard at three oclock this
morning one of the men stumbled over something on the ground and when
they brought the light up they found Rivarez lying across the path
unconscious They raised an alarm at once and called me up and when I
went to examine his cell I found all the windowbars filed through and
a rope made of torn bodylinen hanging from one of them He had let
himself down and climbed along the wall The iron gate which leads into
the subterranean tunnels was found to be unlocked That looks as if the
guards had been suborned

But how did he come to be lying across the path Did he fall from the
rampart and hurt himself

That is what I thought at first Your Eminence but the prison surgeon
cant find any trace of a fall The soldier who was on duty yesterday
says that Rivarez looked very ill last night when he brought in the
supper and did not eat anything But that must be nonsense a sick man
couldnt file those bars through and climb along that roof Its not in
reason

Does he give any account of himself

He is unconscious Your Eminence

Still

He just half comes to himself from time to time and moans and then
goes off again

That is very strange What does the doctor think

He doesnt know what to think There is no trace of heartdisease that
he can find to account for the thing but whatever is the matter with
him it is something that must have come on suddenly just when he had
nearly managed to escape For my part I believe he was struck down by
the direct intervention of a merciful Providence

Montanelli frowned slightly

What are you going to do with him he asked

That is a question I shall settle in a very few days In the meantime I
have had a good lesson That is what comes of taking off the ironswith
all due respect to Your Eminence

I hope Montanelli interrupted that you will at least not replace
the fetters while he is ill A man in the condition you describe can
hardly make any more attempts to escape

I shall take good care he doesnt the Governor muttered to himself as
he went out His Eminence can go hang with his sentimental scruples for
all I care Rivarez is chained pretty tight now and is going to stop
so ill or not

 

But how can it have happened To faint away at the last moment when
everything was ready when he was at the very gate Its like some
hideous joke

I tell you Martini answered the only thing I can think of is that
one of these attacks must have come on and that he must have struggled
against it as long as his strength lasted and have fainted from sheer
exhaustion when he got down into the courtyard

Marcone knocked the ashes savagely from his pipe

Well anyhow thats the end of it we cant do anything for him now
poor fellow

Poor fellow Martini echoed under his breath He was beginning to
realise that to him too the world would look empty and dismal without
the Gadfly

What does she think the smuggler asked glancing towards the other
end of the room where Gemma sat alone her hands lying idly in her lap
her eyes looking straight before her into blank nothingness

I have not asked her she has not spoken since I brought her the news
We had best not disturb her just yet

She did not appear to be conscious of their presence but they both
spoke with lowered voices as though they were looking at a corpse
After a dreary little pause Marcone rose and put away his pipe

I will come back this evening he said but Martini stopped him with a
gesture

Dont go yet I want to speak to you He dropped his voice still lower
and continued in almost a whisper

Do you believe there is really no hope

I dont see what hope there can be now We cant attempt it again Even
if he were well enough to manage his part of the thing we couldnt
do our share The sentinels are all being changed on suspicion The
Cricket wont get another chance you may be sure

Dont you think Martini asked suddenly that when he recovers
something might be done by calling off the sentinels

Calling off the sentinels What do you mean

Well it has occurred to me that if I were to get in the Governors way
when the procession passes close by the fortress on Corpus Domini day
and fire in his face all the sentinels would come rushing to get hold
of me and some of you fellows could perhaps help Rivarez out in the
confusion It really hardly amounts to a plan it only came into my
head

I doubt whether it could be managed Marcone answered with a very
grave face Certainly it would want a lot of thinking out for anything
to come of it Buthe stopped and looked at Martiniif it should be
possiblewould you do it

Martini was a reserved man at ordinary times but this was not an
ordinary time He looked straight into the smugglers face

Would I do it he repeated Look at her

There was no need for further explanations in saying that he had said
all Marcone turned and looked across the room

She had not moved since their conversation began There was no doubt no
fear even no grief in her face there was nothing in it but the shadow
of death The smugglers eyes filled with tears as he looked at her

Make haste Michele he said throwing open the verandah door and
looking out Arent you nearly done you two There are a hundred and
fifty things to do

Michele followed by Gino came in from the verandah

I am ready now he said I only want to ask the signora

He was moving towards her when Martini caught him by the arm

Dont disturb her shes better alone

Let her be Marcone added We shant do any good by meddling God
knows its hard enough on all of us but its worse for her poor
soul



CHAPTER V

FOR a week the Gadfly lay in a fearful state The attack was a violent
one and the Governor rendered brutal by fear and perplexity had not
only chained him hand and foot but had insisted on his being bound to
his pallet with leather straps drawn so tight that he could not move
without their cutting into the flesh He endured everything with his
dogged bitter stoicism till the end of the sixth day Then his pride
broke down and he piteously entreated the prison doctor for a dose
of opium The doctor was quite willing to give it but the Governor
hearing of the request sharply forbade any such foolery

How do you know what he wants it for he said Its just as likely as
not that hes shamming all the time and wants to drug the sentinel or
some such devilry Rivarez is cunning enough for anything

My giving him a dose would hardly help him to drug the sentinel
replied the doctor unable to suppress a smile And as for
shammingtheres not much fear of that He is as likely as not to die

Anyway I wont have it given If a man wants to be tenderly treated
he should behave accordingly He has thoroughly deserved a little sharp
discipline Perhaps it will be a lesson to him not to play tricks with
the windowbars again

The law does not admit of torture though the doctor ventured to say
and this is coming perilously near it

The law says nothing about opium I think said the Governor
snappishly

It is for you to decide of course colonel but I hope you will let
the straps be taken off at any rate They are a needless aggravation of
his misery Theres no fear of his escaping now He couldnt stand if
you let him go free

My good sir a doctor may make a mistake like other people I suppose
I have got him safe strapped now and hes going to stop so

At least then have the straps a little loosened It is downright
barbarity to keep them drawn so tight

They will stop exactly as they are and I will thank you sir not to
talk about barbarity to me If I do a thing I have a reason for it

So the seventh night passed without any relief and the soldier
stationed on guard at the cell door crossed himself shuddering over
and over again as he listened all night long to heartrending moans
The Gadflys endurance was failing him at last

At six in the morning the sentinel just before going off duty unlocked
the door softly and entered the cell He knew that he was committing
a serious breach of discipline but could not bear to go away without
offering the consolation of a friendly word

He found the Gadfly lying still with closed eyes and parted lips He
stood silent for a moment then stooped down and asked

Can I do anything for you sir I have only a minute

The Gadfly opened his eyes Let me alone he moaned Let me
alone

He was asleep almost before the soldier had slipped back to his post

Ten days afterwards the Governor called again at the palace but found
that the Cardinal had gone to visit a sick man at Pieve dOttavo and
was not expected home till the afternoon That evening just as he was
sitting down to dinner his servant came in to announce

His Eminence would like to speak to you

The Governor with a hasty glance into the looking glass to make sure
that his uniform was in order put on his most dignified air and went
into the reception room where Montanelli was sitting beating his hand
gently on the arm of the chair and looking out of the window with an
anxious line between his brows

I heard that you called today he said cutting short the Governors
polite speeches with a slightly imperious manner which he never adopted
in speaking to the country folk It was probably on the business about
which I have been wishing to speak to you

It was about Rivarez Your Eminence

So I supposed I have been thinking the matter over these last few
days But before we go into that I should like to hear whether you have
anything new to tell me

The Governor pulled his moustaches with an embarrassed air

The fact is I came to know whether Your Eminence had anything to tell
me If you still have an objection to the course I proposed taking I
should be sincerely glad of your advice in the matter for honestly I
dont know what to do

Is there any new difficulty

Only that next Thursday is the 3d of JuneCorpus Dominiand somehow
or other the matter must be settled before then

Thursday is Corpus Domini certainly but why must it be settled
especially before then

I am exceedingly sorry Your Eminence if I seem to oppose you but I
cant undertake to be responsible for the peace of the town if Rivarez
is not got rid of before then All the roughest set in the hills
collects here for that day as Your Eminence knows and it is more than
probable that they may attempt to break open the fortress gates and take
him out They wont succeed Ill take care of that if I have to sweep
them from the gates with powder and shot But we are very likely to have
something of that kind before the day is over Here in the Romagna there
is bad blood in the people and when once they get out their knives

I think with a little care we can prevent matters going as far as
knives I have always found the people of this district easy to get on
with if they are reasonably treated Of course if you once begin to
threaten or coerce a Romagnol he becomes unmanageable But have you any
reason for supposing a new rescue scheme is intended

I heard both this morning and yesterday from confidential agents of
mine that a great many rumours are circulating all over the district
and that the people are evidently up to some mischief or other But
one cant find out the details if one could it would be easier to take
precautions And for my part after the fright we had the other day I
prefer to be on the safe side With such a cunning fox as Rivarez one
cant be too careful

The last I heard about Rivarez was that he was too ill to move or
speak Is he recovering then

He seems much better now Your Eminence He certainly has been very
illunless he was shamming all the time

Have you any reason for supposing that likely

Well the doctor seems convinced that it was all genuine but its a
very mysterious kind of illness Any way he is recovering and more
intractable than ever

What has he done now

Theres not much he can do fortunately the Governor answered
smiling as he remembered the straps But his behaviour is something
indescribable Yesterday morning I went into the cell to ask him a
few questions he is not well enough yet to come to me for
interrogationand indeed I thought it best not to run any risk of
the people seeing him until he recovers Such absurd stories always get
about at once

So you went there to interrogate him

Yes Your Eminence I hoped he would be more amenable to reason now

Montanelli looked him over deliberately almost as if he had been
inspecting a new and disagreeable animal Fortunately however the
Governor was fingering his swordbelt and did not see the look He went
on placidly

I have not subjected him to any particular severities but I have been
obliged to be rather strict with himespecially as it is a military
prisonand I thought that perhaps a little indulgence might have a
good effect I offered to relax the discipline considerably if he would
behave in a reasonable manner and how does Your Eminence suppose he
answered me He lay looking at me a minute like a wolf in a cage and
then said quite softly Colonel I cant get up and strangle you
but my teeth are pretty good you had better take your throat a little
further off He is as savage as a wildcat

I am not surprised to hear it Montanelli answered quietly But I
came to ask you a question Do you honestly believe that the presence of
Rivarez in the prison here constitutes a serious danger to the peace of
the district

Most certainly I do Your Eminence

You think that to prevent the risk of bloodshed it is absolutely
necessary that he should somehow be got rid of before Corpus Domini

I can only repeat that if he is here on Thursday I do not expect the
festival to pass over without a fight and I think it likely to be a
serious one

And you think that if he were not here there would be no such danger

In that case there would either be no disturbance at all or at most
a little shouting and stonethrowing If Your Eminence can find some way
of getting rid of him I will undertake that the peace shall be kept
Otherwise I expect most serious trouble I am convinced that a new
rescue plot is on hand and Thursday is the day when we may expect the
attempt Now if on that very morning they suddenly find that he is not
in the fortress at all their plan fails of itself and they have no
occasion to begin fighting But if we have to repulse them and the
daggers once get drawn among such throngs of people we are likely to
have the place burnt down before nightfall

Then why do you not send him in to Ravenna

Heaven knows Your Eminence I should be thankful to do it But how
am I to prevent the people rescuing him on the way I have not soldiers
enough to resist an armed attack and all these mountaineers have got
knives or flintlocks or some such thing

You still persist then in wishing for a courtmartial and in asking
my consent to it

Pardon me Your Eminence I ask you only one thingto help me prevent
riots and bloodshed I am quite willing to admit that the military
commissions such as that of Colonel Freddi were sometimes
unnecessarily severe and irritated instead of subduing the people but
I think that in this case a courtmartial would be a wise measure and
in the long run a merciful one It would prevent a riot which in itself
would be a terrible disaster and which very likely might cause a return
of the military commissions His Holiness has abolished

The Governor finished his little speech with much solemnity and waited
for the Cardinals answer It was a long time coming and when it came
was startlingly unexpected

Colonel Ferrari do you believe in God

Your Eminence the colonel gasped in a voice full of
exclamationstops

Do you believe in God Montanelli repeated rising and looking down at
him with steady searching eyes The colonel rose too

Your Eminence I am a Christian man and have never yet been refused
absolution

Montanelli lifted the cross from his breast

Then swear on the cross of the Redeemer Who died for you that you have
been speaking the truth to me

The colonel stood still and gazed at it blankly He could not quite make
up his mind which was mad he or the Cardinal

You have asked me Montanelli went on to give my consent to a mans
death Kiss the cross if you dare and tell me that you believe there
is no other way to prevent greater bloodshed And remember that if you
tell me a lie you are imperilling your immortal soul

After a little pause the Governor bent down and put the cross to his
lips

I believe it he said

Montanelli turned slowly away

I will give you a definite answer tomorrow But first I must see
Rivarez and speak to him alone

Your Eminenceif I might suggestI am sure you will regret it For
that matter he sent me a message yesterday by the guard asking to see
Your Eminence but I took no notice of it because

Took no notice Montanelli repeated A man in such circumstances sent
you a message and you took no notice of it

I am sorry if Your Eminence is displeased I did not wish to trouble
you over a mere impertinence like that I know Rivarez well enough by
now to feel sure that he only wanted to insult you And indeed if
you will allow me to say so it would be most imprudent to go near him
alone he is really dangerousso much so in fact that I have thought
it necessary to use some physical restraint of a mild kind

And you really think there is much danger to be apprehended from one
sick and unarmed man who is under physical restraint of a mild kind
Montanelli spoke quite gently but the colonel felt the sting of his
quiet contempt and flushed under it resentfully

Your Eminence will do as you think best he said in his stiffest
manner I only wished to spare you the pain of hearing this mans awful
blasphemies

Which do you think the more grievous misfortune for a Christian man
to hear a blasphemous word uttered or to abandon a fellowcreature in
extremity

The Governor stood erect and stiff with his official face like a face
of wood He was deeply offended at Montanellis treatment of him and
showed it by unusual ceremoniousness

At what time does Your Eminence wish to visit the prisoner he asked

I will go to him at once

As Your Eminence pleases If you will kindly wait a few moments I will
send someone to prepare him

The Governor had come down from his official pedestal in a great hurry
He did not want Montanelli to see the straps

Thank you I would rather see him as he is without preparation I will
go straight up to the fortress Goodevening colonel you may expect my
answer tomorrow morning



CHAPTER VI

HEARING the celldoor unlocked the Gadfly turned away his eyes with
languid indifference He supposed that it was only the Governor coming
to worry him with another interrogation Several soldiers mounted
the narrow stair their carbines clanking against the wall then a
deferential voice said It is rather steep here Your Eminence

He started convulsively and then shrank down catching his breath under
the stinging pressure of the straps

Montanelli came in with the sergeant and three guards

If Your Eminence will kindly wait a moment the sergeant began
nervously one of my men will bring a chair He has just gone to fetch
it Your Eminence will excuse usif we had been expecting you we
should have been prepared

There is no need for any preparation Will you kindly leave us alone
sergeant and wait at the foot of the stairs with your men

Yes Your Eminence Here is the chair shall I put it beside him

The Gadfly was lying with closed eyes but he felt that Montanelli was
looking at him

I think he is asleep Your Eminence the sergeant was beginning but
the Gadfly opened his eyes

No he said

As the soldiers were leaving the cell they were stopped by a sudden
exclamation from Montanelli and turning back saw that he was bending
down to examine the straps

Who has been doing this he asked The sergeant fumbled with his cap

It was by the Governors express orders Your Eminence

I had no idea of this Signor Rivarez Montanelli said in a voice of
great distress

I told Your Eminence the Gadfly answered with his hard smile that
I nnnever expected to be patted on the head

Sergeant how long has this been going on

Since he tried to escape Your Eminence

That is nearly a week Bring a knife and cut these off at once

May it please Your Eminence the doctor wanted to take them off but
Colonel Ferrari wouldnt allow it

Bring a knife at once Montanelli had not raised his voice but the
soldiers could see that he was white with anger The sergeant took a
claspknife from his pocket and bent down to cut the armstrap He
was not a skilfulfingered man and he jerked the strap tighter with an
awkward movement so that the Gadfly winced and bit his lip in spite of
all his selfcontrol Montanelli came forward at once

You dont know how to do it give me the knife

Ahhh The Gadfly stretched out his arms with a long rapturous sigh
as the strap fell off The next instant Montanelli had cut the other
one which bound his ankles

Take off the irons too sergeant and then come here I want to speak
to you

He stood by the window looking on till the sergeant threw down the
fetters and approached him

Now he said tell me everything that has been happening

The sergeant nothing loath related all that he knew of the
Gadflys illness of the disciplinary measures and of the doctors
unsuccessful attempt to interfere

But I think Your Eminence he added that the colonel wanted the
straps kept on as a means of getting evidence

Evidence

Yes Your Eminence the day before yesterday I heard him offer to have
them taken off if hewith a glance at the Gadflywould answer a
question he had asked

Montanelli clenched his hand on the windowsill and the soldiers
glanced at one another they had never seen the gentle Cardinal angry
before As for the Gadfly he had forgotten their existence he had
forgotten everything except the physical sensation of freedom He was
cramped in every limb and now stretched and turned and twisted about
in a positive ecstasy of relief

You can go now sergeant the Cardinal said You need not feel
anxious about having committed a breach of discipline it was your duty
to tell me when I asked you See that no one disturbs us I will come
out when I am ready

When the door had closed behind the soldiers he leaned on the
windowsill and looked for a while at the sinking sun so as to leave
the Gadfly a little more breathing time

I have heard he said presently leaving the window and sitting down
beside the pallet that you wish to speak to me alone If you feel well
enough to tell me what you wanted to say I am at your service

He spoke very coldly with a stiff imperious manner that was not
natural to him Until the straps were off the Gadfly was to him simply
a grievously wronged and tortured human being but now he recalled their
last interview and the deadly insult with which it had closed The
Gadfly looked up resting his head lazily on one arm He possessed
the gift of slipping into graceful attitudes and when his face was in
shadow no one would have guessed through what deep waters he had been
passing But as he looked up the clear evening light showed how
haggard and colourless he was and how plainly the trace of the last few
days was stamped on him Montanellis anger died away

I am afraid you have been terribly ill he said I am sincerely sorry
that I did not know of all this I would have put a stop to it before

The Gadfly shrugged his shoulders Alls fair in war he said coolly
Your Eminence objects to straps theoretically from the Christian
standpoint but it is hardly fair to expect the colonel to see that
He no doubt would prefer not to try them on his own skinwhich is
jjjust my case But that is a matter of pppersonal convenience At
this moment I am undermostwwwhat would you have It is very kind of
Your Eminence though to call here but perhaps that was done from the
Ccchristian standpoint too Visiting prisonersah yes I forgot
Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the lleast of theseits not very
complimentary but one of the least is duly grateful

Signor Rivarez the Cardinal interrupted I have come here on your
accountnot on my own If you had not been undermost as you call it
I should never have spoken to you again after what you said to me last
week but you have the double privilege of a prisoner and a sick man
and I could not refuse to come Have you anything to say to me now I am
here or have you sent for me merely to amuse yourself by insulting an
old man

There was no answer The Gadfly had turned away and was lying with one
hand across his eyes

I amvery sorry to trouble you he said at last huskily but could
I have a little water

There was a jug of water standing by the window and Montanelli rose
and fetched it As he slipped his arm round the Gadfly to lift him he
suddenly felt the damp cold fingers close over his wrist like a vice

Give me your handquickjust a moment the Gadfly whispered Oh
what difference does it make to you Only one minute

He sank down hiding his face on Montanellis arm and quivering from
head to foot

Drink a little water Montanelli said after a moment The Gadfly
obeyed silently then lay back on the pallet with closed eyes He
himself could have given no explanation of what had happened to him when
Montanellis hand had touched his cheek he only knew that in all his
life there had been nothing more terrible

Montanelli drew his chair closer to the pallet and sat down The Gadfly
was lying quite motionless like a corpse and his face was livid
and drawn After a long silence he opened his eyes and fixed their
haunting spectral gaze on the Cardinal

Thank you he said Iam sorry I thinkyou asked me something

You are not fit to talk If there is anything you want to say to me I
will try to come again tomorrow

Please dont go Your Eminenceindeed there is nothing the matter
with me II have been a little upset these few days it was half of it
malingering thoughthe colonel will tell you so if you ask him

I prefer to form my own conclusions Montanelli answered quietly

Sso does the colonel And occasionally do you know they are rather
witty You wwwouldnt think it to look at him but sssometimes he
gets hold of an orrriginal idea On Friday night for instanceI
think it was Friday but I got a llittle mixed as to time towards
the endanyhow I asked for a ddose of opiumI remember that quite
distinctly and he came in here and said I mmight hhhave it if I
would tell him who unlllocked the gate I remember his saying If
its real youll consent if you dont I shall look upon it as a
pproof that you are shamming It nnnever occcurred to me before
how comic that is its one of the fffunniest things

He burst into a sudden fit of harsh discordant laughter then turning
sharply on the silent Cardinal went on more and more hurriedly and
stammering so that the words were hardly intelligible

You dddont see that its fffunny Of ccourse not you rreligious
people nnnever have any ssense of humouryou ttake everything
tttragically Ffor instance that night in the Caththedralhow
solemn you were By the waywwhat a paththetic figure I must
have ccut as the pilgrim I ddont believe you eeven see anything
cccomic in the bbusiness you have ccome about this evening

Montanelli rose

I came to hear what you have to say but I think you are too much
excited to say it tonight The doctor had better give you a sedative
and we will talk tomorrow when you have had a nights sleep

Ssleep Oh I shall ssleep well enough Your Eminence when you
ggive your cconsent to the colonels planan ounce of llead is a
ssplendid sedative

I dont understand you Montanelli said turning to him with a
startled look

The Gadfly burst out laughing again

Your Eminence Your Eminence tttruth is the cchief of the Christian
virtues Dddo you thththink I dddont know how hard the Governor
has been trying to gget your consent to a courtmartial You had
bbetter by half ggive it Your Eminence its only wwhat all your
bbrother prelates would do in your place Cosi fan tutti and then
you would be doing ssuch a lot of good and so llittle harm Really
its nnot worth all the sleepless nights you have been spending over
it

Please stop laughing a minute Montanelli interrupted and tell me
how you heard all this Who has been talking to you about it

Hhasnt the colonel eeever told you I am a dddevilnot a man No
He has ttold me so often enough Well I am devil enough to ffind
out a little bit what ppeople are thinking about Your Eeminence is
thinking that Im a conffounded nuisance and you wish ssomebody
else had to settle whats to be done with me without disturbing your
ssensitive conscience Thats a ppretty fair guess isnt it

Listen to me the Cardinal said sitting down again beside him with
a very grave face However you found out all this it is quite true
Colonel Ferrari fears another rescue attempt on the part of your
friends and wishes to forestall it inthe way you speak of You see I
am quite frank with you

Your Eeminence was always fffamous for truthfulness the Gadfly put
in bitterly

You know of course Montanelli went on that legally I have no
jurisdiction in temporal matters I am a bishop not a legate But I
have a good deal of influence in this district and the colonel will
not I think venture to take so extreme a course unless he can get
at least my tacit consent to it Up till now I have unconditionally
opposed the scheme and he has been trying very hard to conquer my
objection by assuring me that there is great danger of an armed attempt
on Thursday when the crowd collects for the processionan attempt which
probably would end in bloodshed Do you follow me

The Gadfly was staring absently out of the window He looked round and
answered in a weary voice

Yes I am listening

Perhaps you are really not well enough to stand this conversation
tonight Shall I come back in the morning It is a very serious matter
and I want your whole attention

I would rather get it over now the Gadfly answered in the same tone
I follow everything you say

Now if it be true Montanelli went on that there is any real danger
of riots and bloodshed on account of you I am taking upon myself a
tremendous responsibility in opposing the colonel and I believe there
is at least some truth in what he says On the other hand I am inclined
to think that his judgment is warped to a certain extent by his
personal animosity against you and that he probably exaggerates the
danger That seems to me the more likely since I have seen this shameful
brutality He glanced at the straps and chains lying on the floor and
went on

If I consent I kill you if I refuse I run the risk of killing
innocent persons I have considered the matter earnestly and have
sought with all my heart for a way out of this dreadful alternative And
now at last I have made up my mind

To kill me and ssave the innocent persons of coursethe only
decision a Christian man could possibly come to If thy rright hand
offend thee etc I have nnot the honour to be the right hand of Your
Eminence and I have offended you the ccconclusion is plain Couldnt
you tell me that without so much preamble

The Gadfly spoke with languid indifference and contempt like a man
weary of the whole subject

Well he added after a little pause Was that the decision Your
Eminence

No

The Gadfly shifted his position putting both hands behind his head and
looked at Montanelli with halfshut eyes The Cardinal with his head
sunk down as in deep thought was softly beating one hand on the arm of
his chair Ah that old familiar gesture

I have decided he said raising his head at last to do I suppose
an utterly unprecedented thing When I heard that you had asked to see
me I resolved to come here and tell you everything as I have done and
to place the matter in your own hands

Inmy hands

Signor Rivarez I have not come to you as cardinal or as bishop or
as judge I have come to you as one man to another I do not ask you to
tell me whether you know of any such scheme as the colonel apprehends
I understand quite well that if you do it is your secret and you will
not tell it But I do ask you to put yourself in my place I am old
and no doubt have not much longer to live I would go down to my grave
without blood on my hands

Is there none on them as yet Your Eminence

Montanelli grew a shade paler but went on quietly

All my life I have opposed repressive measures and cruelty wherever I
have met with them I have always disapproved of capital punishment in
all its forms I have protested earnestly and repeatedly against the
military commissions in the last reign and have been out of favour
on account of doing so Up till now such influence and power as I have
possessed have always been employed on the side of mercy I ask you to
believe me at least that I am speaking the truth Now I am placed in
this dilemma By refusing I am exposing the town to the danger of
riots and all their consequences and this to save the life of a man
who blasphemes against my religion who has slandered and wronged and
insulted me personally though that is comparatively a trifle and who
as I firmly believe will put that life to a bad use when it is given to
him Butit is to save a mans life

He paused a moment and went on again

Signor Rivarez everything that I know of your career seems to me bad
and mischievous and I have long believed you to be reckless and violent
and unscrupulous To some extent I hold that opinion of you still But
during this last fortnight you have shown me that you are a brave man
and that you can be faithful to your friends You have made the soldiers
love and admire you too and not every man could have done that
I think that perhaps I have misjudged you and that there is in you
something better than what you show outside To that better self in
you I appeal and solemnly entreat you on your conscience to tell me
truthfullyin my place what would you do

A long silence followed then the Gadfly looked up

At least I would decide my own actions for myself and take the
consequences of them I would not come sneaking to other people in the
cowardly Christian way asking them to solve my problems for me

The onslaught was so sudden and its extraordinary vehemence and passion
were in such startling contrast to the languid affectation of a moment
before that it was as though he had thrown off a mask

We atheists he went on fiercely understand that if a man has a
thing to bear he must bear it as best he can and if he sinks under
itwhy so much the worse for him But a Christian comes whining to his
God or his saints or if they wont help him to his enemieshe can
always find a back to shift his burdens on to Isnt there a rule to go
by in your Bible or your Missal or any of your canting theology books
that you must come to me to tell you what to do Heavens and earth man
Havent I enough as it is without your laying your responsibilities on
my shoulders Go back to your Jesus he exacted the uttermost farthing
and youd better do the same After all youll only be killing an
atheista man who boggles over shibboleth and thats no great crime
surely

He broke off panting for breath and then burst out again

And YOU to talk of cruelty Why that pppuddingheaded ass couldnt
hurt me as much as you do if he tried for a year he hasnt got the
brains All he can think of is to pull a strap tight and when he cant
get it any tighter hes at the end of his resources Any fool can
do that But you Sign your own death sentence please Im too
tenderhearted to do it myself Oh it would take a Christian to hit on
thata gentle compassionate Christian that turns pale at the sight of
a strap pulled too tight I might have known when you came in like an
angel of mercyso shocked at the colonels barbaritythat the real
thing was going to begin Why do you look at me that way Consent man
of course and go home to your dinner the things not worth all this
fuss Tell your colonel he can have me shot or hanged or whatever
comes handiestroasted alive if its any amusement to himand be done
with it

The Gadfly was hardly recognizable he was beside himself with rage
and desperation panting and quivering his eyes glittering with green
reflections like the eyes of an angry cat

Montanelli had risen and was looking down at him silently He did not
understand the drift of the frenzied reproaches but he understood out
of what extremity they were uttered and understanding that forgave
all past insults

Hush he said I did not want to hurt you so Indeed I never meant
to shift my burden on to you who have too much already I have never
consciously done that to any living creature

Its a lie the Gadfly cried out with blazing eyes And the
bishopric

Thebishopric

Ah youve forgotten that Its so easy to forget If you wish it
Arthur I will say I cannot go I was to decide your life for youI at
nineteen If it werent so hideous it would be funny

Stop Montanelli put up both hands to his head with a desperate cry
He let them fall again and walked slowly away to the window There
he sat down on the sill resting one arm on the bars and pressing his
forehead against it The Gadfly lay and watched him trembling

Presently Montanelli rose and came back with lips as pale as ashes

I am very sorry he said struggling piteously to keep up his usual
quiet manner but I must go home Iam not quite well

He was shivering as if with ague All the Gadflys fury broke down

Padre cant you see

Montanelli shrank away and stood still

Only not that he whispered at last My God anything but that If I
am going mad

The Gadfly raised himself on one arm and took the shaking hands in his

Padre will you never understand that I am not really drowned

The hands grew suddenly cold and stiff For a moment everything was dead
with silence and then Montanelli knelt down and hid his face on the
Gadflys breast

 

When he raised his head the sun had set and the red glow was dying in
the west They had forgotten time and place and life and death they
had forgotten even that they were enemies

Arthur Montanelli whispered are you real Have you come back to me
from the dead

From the dead the Gadfly repeated shivering He was lying with
his head on Montanellis arm as a sick child might lie in its mothers
embrace

You have come backyou have come back at last

The Gadfly sighed heavily Yes he said and you have to fight me or
to kill me

Oh hush carino What is all that now We have been like two children
lost in the dark mistaking one another for phantoms Now we have found
each other and have come out into the light My poor boy how changed
you arehow changed you are You look as if all the ocean of the
worlds misery had passed over your headyou that used to be so full of
the joy of life Arthur is it really you I have dreamed so often that
you had come back to me and then have waked and seen the outer darkness
staring in upon an empty place How can I know I shall not wake again
and find it all a dream Give me something tangibletell me how it all
happened

It happened simply enough I hid on a goods vessel as stowaway and
got out to South America

And there

There Ilived if you like to call it so tilloh I have seen
something else besides theological seminaries since you used to teach me
philosophy You say you have dreamed of meyes and much You say you
have dreamed of meyes and I of you

He broke off shuddering

Once he began again abruptly I was working at a mine in
Ecuador

Not as a miner

No as a miners fagoddjobbing with the coolies We had a barrack to
sleep in at the pits mouth and one nightI had been ill the same
as lately and carrying stones in the blazing sunI must have got
lightheaded for I saw you come in at the doorway You were holding a
crucifix like that one on the wall You were praying and brushed past
me without turning I cried out to you to help meto give me poison
or a knifesomething to put an end to it all before I went mad And
youah

He drew one hand across his eyes Montanelli was still clasping the
other

I saw in your face that you had heard but you never looked round
you went on with your prayers When you had finished and kissed the
crucifix you glanced round and whispered I am very sorry for you
Arthur but I darent show it He would be angry And I looked at Him
and the wooden image was laughing

Then when I came to my senses and saw the barrack and the coolies
with their leprosy I understood I saw that you care more to curry
favour with that devilish God of yours than to save me from any hell
And I have remembered that I forgot just now when you touched me
Ihave been ill and I used to love you once But there can be nothing
between us but war and war and war What do you want to hold my hand
for Cant you see that while you believe in your Jesus we cant be
anything but enemies

Montanelli bent his head and kissed the mutilated hand

Arthur how can I help believing in Him If I have kept my faith
through all these frightful years how can I ever doubt Him any more
now that He has given you back to me Remember I thought I had killed
you

You have that still to do

Arthur It was a cry of actual terror but the Gadfly went on
unheeding

Let us be honest whatever we do and not shillyshally You and I
stand on two sides of a pit and its hopeless trying to join hands
across it If you have decided that you cant or wont give up that
thinghe glanced again at the crucifix on the wallyou must consent
to what the colonel

Consent My GodconsentArthur but I love you

The Gadflys face contracted fearfully

Which do you love best me or that thing

Montanelli slowly rose The very soul in him withered with dread and
he seemed to shrivel up bodily and to grow feeble and old and wilted
like a leaf that the frost has touched He had awaked out of his dream
and the outer darkness was staring in upon an empty place

Arthur have just a little mercy on me

How much had you for me when your lies drove me out to be slave to
the blacks on the sugarplantations You shudder at thatah these
tenderhearted saints This is the man after Gods own heartthe man
that repents of his sin and lives No one dies but his son You say you
love meyour love has cost me dear enough Do you think I can blot out
everything and turn back into Arthur at a few soft wordsI that have
been dishwasher in filthy halfcaste brothels and stableboy to Creole
farmers that were worse brutes than their own cattle I that have
been zany in cap and bells for a strolling variety showdrudge and
Jackofalltrades to the matadors in the bullfighting ring I that
have been slave to every black beast who cared to set his foot on my
neck I that have been starved and spat upon and trampled under foot
I that have begged for mouldy scraps and been refused because the dogs
had the first right Oh what is the use of all this How can I TELL you
what you have brought on me And nowyou love me How much do you love
me Enough to give up your God for me Oh what has He done for you
this everlasting Jesuswhat has He suffered for you that you should
love Him more than me Is it for the pierced hands He is so dear to you
Look at mine Look here and here and here

He tore open his shirt and showed the ghastly scars

Padre this God of yours is an impostor His wounds are sham wounds
His pain is all a farce It is I that have the right to your heart
Padre there is no torture you have not put me to if you could only
know what my life has been And yet I would not die I have endured it
all and have possessed my soul in patience because I would come
back and fight this God of yours I have held this purpose as a shield
against my heart and it has saved me from madness and from the second
death And now when I come back I find Him still in my placethis
sham victim that was crucified for six hours forsooth and rose again
from the dead Padre I have been crucified for five years and I too
have risen from the dead What are you going to do with me What are you
going to do with me

He broke down Montanelli sat like some stone image or like a dead man
set upright At first under the fiery torrent of the Gadflys despair
he had quivered a little with the automatic shrinking of the flesh
as under the lash of a whip but now he was quite still After a long
silence he looked up and spoke lifelessly patiently

Arthur will you explain to me more clearly You confuse and terrify me
so I cant understand What is it you demand of me

The Gadfly turned to him a spectral face

I demand nothing Who shall compel love You are free to choose between
us two the one who is most dear to you If you love Him best choose
Him

I cant understand Montanelli repeated wearily What is there I can
choose I cannot undo the past

You have to choose between us If you love me take that cross off your
neck and come away with me My friends are arranging another attempt
and with your help they could manage it easily Then when we are safe
over the frontier acknowledge me publicly But if you dont love me
enough for thatif this wooden idol is more to you than Ithen go
to the colonel and tell him you consent And if you go then go at once
and spare me the misery of seeing you I have enough without that

Montanelli looked up trembling faintly He was beginning to understand

I will communicate with your friends of course Butto go with
youit is impossibleI am a priest

And I accept no favours from priests I will have no more compromises
Padre I have had enough of them and of their consequences You must
give up your priesthood or you must give up me

How can I give you up Arthur how can I give you up

Then give up Him You have to choose between us Would you offer me a
share of your lovehalf for me half for your fiend of a God I will
not take His leavings If you are His you are not mine

Would you have me tear my heart in two Arthur Arthur Do you want to
drive me mad

The Gadfly struck his hand against the wall

You have to choose between us he repeated once more

Montanelli drew from his breast a little case containing a bit of soiled
and crumpled paper

Look he said


I believed in you as I believed in God God is a thing made of clay
that I can smash with a hammer and you have fooled me with a lie


The Gadfly laughed and handed it back How dddelightfully young one
is at nineteen To take a hammer and smash things seems so easy Its
that nowonly its I that am under the hammer As for you there are
plenty of other people you can fool with liesand they wont even find
you out

As you will Montanelli said Perhaps in your place I should be as
merciless as youGod knows I cant do what you ask Arthur but I will
do what I can I will arrange your escape and when you are safe I will
have an accident in the mountains or take the wrong sleepingdraught by
mistakewhatever you like to choose Will that content you It is all
I can do It is a great sin but I think He will forgive me He is more
merciful

The Gadfly flung out both hands with a sharp cry

Oh that is too much That is too much What have I done that you
should think of me that way What right have you As if I wanted to
be revenged on you Cant you see that I only want to save you Will you
never understand that I love you

He caught hold of Montanellis hands and covered them with burning
kisses and tears

Padre come away with us What have you to do with this dead world of
priests and idols They are full of the dust of bygone ages they are
rotten they are pestilent and foul Come out of this plaguestricken
Churchcome away with us into the light Padre it is we that are life
and youth it is we that are the everlasting springtime it is we that
are the future Padre the dawn is close upon uswill you miss
your part in the sunrise Wake up and let us forget the horrible
nightmareswake up and we will begin our life again Padre I have
always loved youalways even when you killed mewill you kill me
again

Montanelli tore his hands away Oh God have mercy on me he cried
out YOU HAVE YOUR MOTHERS EYES

A strange silence long and deep and sudden fell upon them both In the
gray twilight they looked at each other and their hearts stood still
with fear

Have you anything more to say Montanelli whispered Anyhope to
give me

No My life is of no use to me except to fight priests I am not a man
I am a knife If you let me live you sanction knives

Montanelli turned to the crucifix God Listen to this

His voice died away into the empty stillness without response Only the
mocking devil awoke again in the Gadfly

Cccall him louder perchance he sssleepeth

Montanelli started up as if he had been struck For a moment he stood
looking straight before himthen he sat down on the edge of the
pallet covered his face with both hands and burst into tears A long
shudder passed through the Gadfly and the damp cold broke out on his
body He knew what the tears meant

He drew the blanket over his head that he might not hear It was enough
that he had to diehe who was so vividly magnificently alive But he
could not shut out the sound it rang in his ears it beat in his brain
it throbbed in all his pulses And still Montanelli sobbed and sobbed
and the tears dripped down between his fingers

He left off sobbing at last and dried his eyes with his handkerchief
like a child that has been crying As he stood up the handkerchief
slipped from his knee and fell to the floor

There is no use in talking any more he said You understand

I understand the Gadfly answered with dull submission Its not
your fault Your God is hungry and must be fed

Montanelli turned towards him The grave that was to be dug was not more
still than they were Silent they looked into each others eyes as two
lovers torn apart might gaze across the barrier they cannot pass

It was the Gadfly whose eyes sank first He shrank down hiding his
face and Montanelli understood that the gesture meant Go He turned
and went out of the cell A moment later the Gadfly started up

Oh I cant bear it Padre come back Come back

The door was shut He looked around him slowly with a wide still gaze
and understood that all was over The Galilean had conquered

All night long the grass waved softly in the courtyard belowthe grass
that was so soon to wither uprooted by the spade and all night long
the Gadfly lay alone in the darkness and sobbed



CHAPTER VII

THE courtmartial was held on Tuesday morning It was a very short and
simple affair a mere formality occupying barely twenty minutes There
was indeed nothing to spend much time over no defence was allowed
and the only witnesses were the wounded spy and officer and a few
soldiers The sentence was drawn up beforehand Montanelli had sent in
the desired informal consent and the judges Colonel Ferrari the local
major of dragoons and two officers of the Swiss guards had little to
do The indictment was read aloud the witnesses gave their evidence
and the signatures were affixed to the sentence which was then read to
the condemned man with befitting solemnity He listened in silence and
when asked according to the usual form whether he had anything to say
merely waved the question aside with an impatient movement of his hand
Hidden on his breast was the handkerchief which Montanelli had let fall
It had been kissed and wept over all night as though it were a living
thing Now he looked wan and spiritless and the traces of tears were
still about his eyelids but the words to be shot did not seem to
affect him much When they were uttered the pupils of his eyes dilated
but that was all

Take him back to his cell the Governor said when all the formalities
were over and the sergeant who was evidently near to breaking down
touched the motionless figure on the shoulder The Gadfly looked round
him with a little start

Ah yes he said I forgot

There was something almost like pity in the Governors face He was not
a cruel man by nature and was secretly a little ashamed of the part
he had been playing during the last month Now that his main point was
gained he was willing to make every little concession in his power

You neednt put the irons on again he said glancing at the bruised
and swollen wrists And he can stay in his own cell The condemned cell
is wretchedly dark and gloomy he added turning to his nephew and
really the things a mere formality

He coughed and shifted his feet in evident embarrassment then called
back the sergeant who was leaving the room with his prisoner

Wait sergeant I want to speak to him

The Gadfly did not move and the Governors voice seemed to fall on
unresponsive ears

If you have any message you would like conveyed to your friends or
relatives You have relatives I suppose

There was no answer

Well think it over and tell me or the priest I will see it is not
neglected You had better give your messages to the priest he shall
come at once and stay the night with you If there is any other
wish

The Gadfly looked up

Tell the priest I would rather be alone I have no friends and no
messages

But you will want to confess

I am an atheist I want nothing but to be left in peace

He said it in a dull quiet voice without defiance or irritation and
turned slowly away At the door he stopped again

I forgot colonel there is a favour I wanted to ask Dont let them
tie me or bandage my eyes tomorrow please I will stand quite still

 

At sunrise on Wednesday morning they brought him out into the courtyard
His lameness was more than usually apparent and he walked with evident
difficulty and pain leaning heavily on the sergeants arm but all the
weary submission had gone out of his face The spectral terrors that
had crushed him down in the empty silence the visions and dreams of the
world of shadows were gone with the night which gave them birth and
once the sun was shining and his enemies were present to rouse the
fighting spirit in him he was not afraid

The six carabineers who had been told off for the execution were drawn
up in line against the ivied wall the same crannied and crumbling wall
down which he had climbed on the night of his unlucky attempt They
could hardly refrain from weeping as they stood together each man with
his carbine in his hand It seemed to them a horror beyond imagination
that they should be called out to kill the Gadfly He and his stinging
repartees his perpetual laughter his bright infectious courage had
come into their dull and dreary lives like a wandering sunbeam and that
he should die and at their hands was to them as the darkening of the
clear lamps of heaven

Under the great figtree in the courtyard his grave was waiting for
him It had been dug in the night by unwilling hands and tears had
fallen on the spade As he passed he looked down smiling at the black
pit and the withering grass beside it and drew a long breath to smell
the scent of the freshly turned earth

Near the tree the sergeant stopped short and the Gadfly looked round
with his brightest smile

Shall I stand here sergeant

The man nodded silently there was a lump in his throat and he
could not have spoken to save his life The Governor his nephew the
lieutenant of carabineers who was to command a doctor and a priest
were already in the courtyard and came forward with grave faces half
abashed under the radiant defiance of the Gadflys laughing eyes

Ggood morning gentlemen Ah and his reverence is up so early too
How do you do captain This is a pleasanter occasion for you than our
former meeting isnt it I see your arm is still in a sling
thats because I bungled my work These good fellows will do theirs
betterwont you lads

He glanced round at the gloomy faces of the carabineers

Therell be no need of slings this time any way There there you
neednt look so doleful over it Put your heels together and show how
straight you can shoot Before long therell be more work cut out
for you than youll know how to get through and theres nothing like
practice beforehand

My son the priest interrupted coming forward while the others drew
back to leave them alone together in a few minutes you must enter into
the presence of your Maker Have you no other use but this for these
last moments that are left you for repentance Think I entreat you
how dreadful a thing it is to die without absolution with all your sins
upon your head When you stand before your Judge it will be too late to
repent Will you approach His awful throne with a jest upon your lips

A jest your reverence It is your side that needs that little homily
I think When our turn comes we shall use fieldguns instead of half a
dozen secondhand carbines and then youll see how much were in jest

YOU will use fieldguns Oh unhappy man Have you still not realized
on what frightful brink you stand

The Gadfly glanced back over his shoulder at the open grave

And ssso your reverence thinks that when you have put me down there
you will have done with me Perhaps you will lay a stone on the top to
prevvent a rresurrection after three days No fear your reverence
I shant poach on the monopoly in cheap theatricals I shall lie as
still as a mmouse just where you put me And all the same WE shall
use fieldguns

Oh merciful God the priest cried out forgive this wretched man

Amen murmured the lieutenant of carabineers in a deep bass growl
while the colonel and his nephew crossed themselves devoutly

As there was evidently no hope of further insistence producing any
effect the priest gave up the fruitless attempt and moved aside
shaking his head and murmuring a prayer The short and simple
preparations were made without more delay and the Gadfly placed himself
in the required position only turning his head to glance up for a
moment at the red and yellow splendour of the sunrise He had repeated
the request that his eyes might not be bandaged and his defiant face
had wrung from the colonel a reluctant consent They had both forgotten
what they were inflicting on the soldiers

He stood and faced them smiling and the carbines shook in their hands

I am quite ready he said

The lieutenant stepped forward trembling a little with excitement He
had never given the word of command for an execution before

Readypresentfire

The Gadfly staggered a little and recovered his balance One unsteady
shot had grazed his cheek and a little blood fell on to the white
cravat Another ball had struck him above the knee When the smoke
cleared away the soldiers looked and saw him smiling still and wiping
the blood from his cheek with the mutilated hand

A bad shot men he said and his voice cut in clear and articulate
upon the dazed stupor of the wretched soldiers Have another try

A general groan and shudder passed through the row of carabineers Each
man had aimed aside with a secret hope that the deathshot would come
from his neighbours hand not his and there the Gadfly stood and
smiled at them they had only turned the execution into a butchery and
the whole ghastly business was to do again They were seized with sudden
terror and lowering their carbines listened hopelessly to the furious
curses and reproaches of the officers staring in dull horror at the man
whom they had killed and who somehow was not dead

The Governor shook his fist in their faces savagely shouting to them
to stand in position to present arms to make haste and get the thing
over He had become as thoroughly demoralized as they were and dared
not look at the terrible figure that stood and stood and would not
fall When the Gadfly spoke to him he started and shuddered at the sound
of the mocking voice

You have brought out the awkward squad this morning colonel Let me
see if I can manage them better Now men Hold your tool higher there
you to the left Bless your heart man its a carbine youve got
in your hand not a fryingpan Are you all straight Now then
Readypresent

Fire the colonel interrupted starting forward It was intolerable
that this man should give the command for his own death

There was another confused disorganized volley and the line broke up
into a knot of shivering figures staring before them with wild eyes
One of the soldiers had not even discharged his carbine he had flung it
away and crouched down moaning under his breath I cantI cant

The smoke cleared slowly away floating up into the glimmer of the early
sunlight and they saw that the Gadfly had fallen and saw too that he
was still not dead For the first moment soldiers and officials stood
as if they had been turned to stone and watched the ghastly thing that
writhed and struggled on the ground then both doctor and colonel rushed
forward with a cry for he had dragged himself up on one knee and was
still facing the soldiers and still laughing

Another miss Tryagain ladsseeif you cant

He suddenly swayed and fell over sideways on the grass

Is he dead the colonel asked under his breath and the doctor
kneeling down with a hand on the bloody shirt answered softly

I think soGod be praised

God be praised the colonel repeated At last

His nephew was touching him on the arm

Uncle Its the Cardinal Hes at the gate and wants to come in

What He cant come inI wont have it What are the guards about
Your Eminence

The gate had opened and shut and Montanelli was standing in the
courtyard looking before him with still and awful eyes

Your Eminence I must beg of youthis is not a fit sight for you The
execution is only just over the body is not yet

I have come to look at him Montanelli said Even at the moment
it struck the Governor that his voice and bearing were those of a
sleepwalker

Oh my God one of the soldiers cried out suddenly and the Governor
glanced hastily back Surely

The bloodstained heap on the grass had once more begun to struggle and
moan The doctor flung himself down and lifted the head upon his knee

Make haste he cried in desperation You savages make haste Get it
over for Gods sake Theres no bearing this

Great jets of blood poured over his hands and the convulsions of the
figure that he held in his arms shook him too from head to foot As he
looked frantically round for help the priest bent over his shoulder and
put a crucifix to the lips of the dying man

In the name of the Father and of the Son

The Gadfly raised himself against the doctors knee and with wideopen
eyes looked straight upon the crucifix

Slowly amid hushed and frozen stillness he lifted the broken right
hand and pushed away the image There was a red smear across its face

Padreis yourGodsatisfied

His head fell back on the doctors arm

 

Your Eminence

As the Cardinal did not awake from his stupor Colonel Ferrari repeated
louder

Your Eminence

Montanelli looked up

He is dead

Quite dead your Eminence Will you not come away This is a horrible
sight

He is dead Montanelli repeated and looked down again at the face I
touched him and he is dead

What does he expect a man to be with half a dozen bullets in him the
lieutenant whispered contemptuously and the doctor whispered back I
think the sight of the blood has upset him

The Governor put his hand firmly on Montanellis arm

Your Eminenceyou had better not look at him any longer Will you
allow the chaplain to escort you home

YesI will go

He turned slowly from the bloodstained spot and walked away the priest
and sergeant following At the gate he paused and looked back with a
ghostlike still surprise

He is dead

 

A few hours later Marcone went up to a cottage on the hillside to tell
Martini that there was no longer any need for him to throw away his
life

All the preparations for a second attempt at rescue were ready as the
plot was much more simple than the former one It had been arranged that
on the following morning as the Corpus Domini procession passed along
the fortress hill Martini should step forward out of the crowd draw a
pistol from his breast and fire in the Governors face In the moment
of wild confusion which would follow twenty armed men were to make a
sudden rush at the gate break into the tower and taking the turnkey
with them by force to enter the prisoners cell and carry him bodily
away killing or overpowering everyone who interfered with them From
the gate they were to retire fighting and cover the retreat of a second
band of armed and mounted smugglers who would carry him off into a safe
hidingplace in the hills The only person in the little group who knew
nothing of the plan was Gemma it had been kept from her at Martinis
special desire She will break her heart over it soon enough he had
said

As the smuggler came in at the garden gate Martini opened the glass door
and stepped out on to the verandah to meet him

Any news Marcone Ah

The smuggler had pushed back his broadbrimmed straw hat

They sat down together on the verandah Not a word was spoken on either
side From the instant when Martini had caught sight of the face under
the hatbrim he had understood

When was it he asked after a long pause and his own voice in his
ears was as dull and wearisome as everything else

This morning at sunrise The sergeant told me He was there and saw
it

Martini looked down and flicked a stray thread from his coatsleeve

Vanity of vanities this also is vanity He was to have died tomorrow
And now the land of his hearts desire had vanished like the fairyland
of golden sunset dreams that fades away when the darkness comes and he
was driven back into the world of every day and every nightthe
world of Grassini and Galli of ciphering and pamphleteering of party
squabbles between comrades and dreary intrigues among Austrian spiesof
the old revolutionary millround that maketh the heart sick And
somewhere down at the bottom of his consciousness there was a great
empty place a place that nothing and no one would fill any more now
that the Gadfly was dead

Someone was asking him a question and he raised his head wondering
what could be left that was worth the trouble of talking about

What did you say

I was saying that of course you will break the news to her

Life and all the horror of life came back into Martinis face

How can I tell her he cried out You might as well ask me to go and
stab her Oh how can I tell herhow can I

He had clasped both hands over his eyes but without seeing he felt
the smuggler start beside him and looked up Gemma was standing in the
doorway

Have you heard Cesare she said It is all over They have shot
him



CHAPTER VIII

INTROIBO ad altare Dei Montanelli stood before the high altar among
his ministers and acolytes and read the Introit aloud in steady tones
All the Cathedral was a blaze of light and colour from the holiday
dresses of the congregation to the pillars with their flaming draperies
and wreaths of flowers there was no dull spot in it Over the open
spaces of the doorway fell great scarlet curtains through whose folds
the hot June sunlight glowed as through the petals of red poppies in
a cornfield The religious orders with their candles and torches the
companies of the parishes with their crosses and flags lighted up the
dim sidechapels and in the aisles the silken folds of the processional
banners drooped their gilded staves and tassels glinting under the
arches The surplices of the choristers gleamed rainbowtinted beneath
the coloured windows the sunlight lay on the chancel floor in
chequered stains of orange and purple and green Behind the altar hung
a shimmering veil of silver tissue and against the veil and the
decorations and the altarlights the Cardinals figure stood out in its
trailing white robes like a marble statue that had come to life

As was customary on processional days he was only to preside at the
Mass not to celebrate so at the end of the Indulgentiam he turned
from the altar and walked slowly to the episcopal throne celebrant and
ministers bowing low as he passed

Im afraid His Eminence is not well one of the canons whispered to
his neighbour he seems so strange

Montanelli bent his head to receive the jewelled mitre The priest who
was acting as deacon of honour put it on looked at him for an instant
then leaned forward and whispered softly

Your Eminence are you ill

Montanelli turned slightly towards him There was no recognition in his
eyes

Pardon Your Eminence the priest whispered as he made a genuflexion
and went back to his place reproaching himself for having interrupted
the Cardinals devotions

The familiar ceremony went on and Montanelli sat erect and still his
glittering mitre and goldbrocaded vestments flashing back the sunlight
and the heavy folds of his white festival mantle sweeping down over the
red carpet The light of a hundred candles sparkled among the sapphires
on his breast and shone into the deep still eyes that had no answering
gleam and when at the words Benedicite pater eminentissime
he stooped to bless the incense and the sunbeams played among the
diamonds he might have recalled some splendid and fearful icespirit
of the mountains crowned with rainbows and robed in drifted snow
scattering with extended hands a shower of blessings or of curses

At the elevation of the Host he descended from his throne and knelt
before the altar There was a strange still evenness about all his
movements and as he rose and went back to his place the major of
dragoons who was sitting in gala uniform behind the Governor whispered
to the wounded captain The old Cardinals breaking not a doubt of it
He goes through his work like a machine

So much the better the captain whispered back Hes been nothing but
a millstone round all our necks ever since that confounded amnesty

He did give in though about the courtmartial

Yes at last but he was a precious time making up his mind to
Heavens how close it is We shall all get sunstroke in the procession
Its a pity were not Cardinals to have a canopy held over our heads
all the way Shshsh Theres my uncle looking at us

Colonel Ferrari had turned round to glance severely at the two younger
officers After the solemn event of yesterday morning he was in a devout
and serious frame of mind and inclined to reproach them with a want of
proper feeling about what he regarded as a painful necessity of state

The masters of the ceremonies began to assemble and place in order those
who were to take part in the procession Colonel Ferrari rose from his
place and moved up to the chancelrail beckoning to the other officers
to accompany him When the Mass was finished and the Host had been
placed behind the crystal shield in the processional sun the celebrant
and his ministers retired to the sacristy to change their vestments and
a little buzz of whispered conversation broke out through the church
Montanelli remained seated on his throne looking straight before him
immovably All the sea of human life and motion seemed to surge around
and below him and to die away into stillness about his feet A censer
was brought to him and he raised his hand with the action of an
automaton and put the incense into the vessel looking neither to the
right nor to the left

The clergy had come back from the sacristy and were waiting in the
chancel for him to descend but he remained utterly motionless The
deacon of honour bending forward to take off the mitre whispered
again hesitatingly

Your Eminence

The Cardinal looked round

What did you say

Are you quite sure the procession will not be too much for you The sun
is very hot

What does the sun matter

Montanelli spoke in a cold measured voice and the priest again fancied
that he must have given offence

Forgive me Your Eminence I thought you seemed unwell

Montanelli rose without answering He paused a moment on the upper step
of the throne and asked in the same measured way

What is that

The long train of his mantle swept down over the steps and lay spread
out on the chancelfloor and he was pointing to a fiery stain on the
white satin

Its only the sunlight shining through a coloured window Your
Eminence

The sunlight Is it so red

He descended the steps and knelt before the altar swinging the censer
slowly to and fro As he handed it back the chequered sunlight fell on
his bared head and wide uplifted eyes and cast a crimson glow across
the white veil that his ministers were folding round him

He took from the deacon the sacred golden sun and stood up as choir
and organ burst into a peal of triumphal melody


 Pange lingua goriosi
 Corporis mysterium
 Sanguinisque pretiosi
 Quem in mundi pretium
 Fructus ventris generosi
 Rex effudit gentium


The bearers came slowly forward and raised the silken canopy over his
head while the deacons of honour stepped to their places at his right
and left and drew back the long folds of the mantle As the acolytes
stooped to lift his robe from the chancelfloor the lay fraternities
heading the procession started to pace down the nave in stately double
file with lighted candles held to left and right

He stood above them by the altar motionless under the white canopy
holding the Eucharist aloft with steady hands and watched them as they
passed Two by two with candles and banners and torches with crosses
and images and flags they swept slowly down the chancel steps along
the broad nave between the garlanded pillars and out under the lifted
scarlet curtains into the blazing sunlight of the street and the sound
of their chanting died into a rolling murmur drowned in the pealing
of new and newer voices as the unending stream flowed on and yet new
footsteps echoed down the nave

The companies of the parishes passed with their white shrouds and
veiled faces then the brothers of the Misericordia black from head to
foot their eyes faintly gleaming through the holes in their masks Next
came the monks in solemn row the mendicant friars with their dusky
cowls and bare brown feet the whiterobed grave Dominicans Then
followed the lay officials of the district dragoons and carabineers
and the local policeofficials the Governor in gala uniform with his
brother officers beside him A deacon followed holding up a great cross
between two acolytes with gleaming candles and as the curtains were
lifted high to let them pass out at the doorway Montanelli caught a
momentary glimpse from where he stood under the canopy of the sunlit
blaze of carpeted street and flaghung walls and whiterobed children
scattering roses Ah the roses how red they were

On and on the procession paced in order form succeeding to form and
colour to colour Long white surplices grave and seemly gave place
to gorgeous vestments and embroidered pluvials Now passed a tall and
slender golden cross borne high above the lighted candles now the
cathedral canons stately in their dead white mantles A chaplain paced
down the chancel with the crozier between two flaring torches then the
acolytes moved forward in step their censers swinging to the rhythm of
the music the bearers raised the canopy higher counting their steps
One two one two and Montanelli started upon the Way of the Cross

Down the chancel steps and all along the nave he passed under the
gallery where the organ pealed and thundered under the lifted curtains
that were so redso fearfully red and out into the glaring street
where the bloodred roses lay and withered crushed into the red carpet
by the passing of many feet A moments pause at the door while the
lay officials came forward to replace the canopybearers then the
procession moved on again and he with it his hands clasping the
Eucharistic sun and the voices of the choristers swelling and dying
around him with the rhythmical swaying of censers and the rolling tramp
of feet


 Verbum caro panem verum
 Verbo carnem efficit
 Sitque sanguis Christi merum


Always blood and always blood The carpet stretched before him like a
red river the roses lay like blood splashed on the stones Oh God
Is all Thine earth grown red and all Thy heaven Ah what is it to
Thee Thou mighty GodThou whose very lips are smeared with blood


 Tantum ergo Sacramentum
 Veneremur cernui


He looked through the crystal shield at the Eucharist What was that
oozing from the waferdripping down between the points of the golden
sundown on to his white robe What had he seen dripping downdripping
from a lifted hand

The grass in the courtyard was trampled and redall redthere was
so much blood It was trickling down the cheek and dripping from the
pierced right hand and gushing in a hot red torrent from the wounded
side Even a lock of the hair was dabbled in itthe hair that lay all
wet and matted on the foreheadah that was the deathsweat it came
from the horrible pain

The voices of the choristers rose higher triumphantly


 Genitori genitoque
 Laus et jubilatio
 Salus honor virtus quoque
 Sit et benedictio


Oh that is more than any patience can endure God Who sittest on the
brazen heavens enthroned and smilest with bloody lips looking down
upon agony and death is it not enough Is it not enough without this
mockery of praise and blessing Body of Christ Thou that wast broken
for the salvation of men blood of Christ Thou that wast shed for the
remission of sins is it not enough

Ah call Him louder perchance He sleepeth

Dost Thou sleep indeed dear love and wilt Thou never wake again Is
the grave so jealous of its victory and will the black pit under the
tree not loose Thee even for a little hearts delight

Then the Thing behind the crystal shield made answer and the blood
dripped down as It spoke

Hast thou chosen and wilt repent of thy choice Is thy desire not
fulfilled Look upon these men that walk in the light and are clad in
silk and in gold for their sake was I laid in the black pit Look upon
the children scattering roses and hearken to their singing if it be
sweet for their sake is my mouth filled with dust and the roses are
red from the wellsprings of my heart See where the people kneel to
drink the blood that drips from thy garmenthem for their sake was it
shed to quench their ravening thirst For it is written Greater love
hath no man than this if a man lay down his life for his friends

Oh Arthur Arthur there is greater love than this If a man lay down
the life of his best beloved is not that greater

And It answered again

Who is thy best beloved In sooth not I

And when he would have spoken the words froze on his tongue for the
singing of the choristers passed over them as the north wind over icy
pools and hushed them into silence


 Dedit fragilibus corporis ferculum
 Dedit et tristibus sanguinis poculum
 Dicens Accipite quod trado vasculum
 Omnes ex eo bibite


Drink of it Christians drink of it all of you Is it not yours For
you the red stream stains the grass for you the living flesh is seared
and torn Eat of it cannibals eat of it all of you This is your
feast and your orgy this is the day of your joy Haste you and come to
the festival join the procession and march with us women and children
young men and old mencome to the sharing of flesh Come to the pouring
of bloodwine and drink of it while it is red take and eat of the
Body

Ah God the fortress Sullen and brown with crumbling battlements
and towers dark among the barren hills it scowled on the procession
sweeping past in the dusty road below The iron teeth of the portcullis
were drawn down over the mouth of the gate and as a beast crouched
on the mountainside the fortress guarded its prey Yet be the teeth
clenched never so fast they shall be broken and riven asunder and the
grave in the courtyard within shall yield up her dead For the Christian
hosts are marching marching in mighty procession to their sacramental
feast of blood as marches an army of famished rats to the gleaning and
their cry is Give Give and they say not It is enough

Wilt thou not be satisfied For these men was I sacrificed thou hast
destroyed me that they might live and behold they march everyone on
his ways and they shall not break their ranks

This is the army of Christians the followers of thy God a great
people and a strong A fire devoureth before them and behind them a
flame burneth the land is as the garden of Eden before them and behind
them a desolate wilderness yea and nothing shall escape them

Oh yet come back come back to me beloved for I repent me of my
choice Come back and we will creep away together to some dark and
silent grave where the devouring army shall not find us and we will lay
us down there locked in one anothers arms and sleep and sleep and
sleep And the hungry Christians shall pass by in the merciless daylight
above our heads and when they howl for blood to drink and for flesh to
eat their cry shall be faint in our ears and they shall pass on their
ways and leave us to our rest

And It answered yet again

Where shall I hide me Is it not written They shall run to and fro
in the city they shall run upon the wall they shall climb up upon the
houses they shall enter in at the windows like a thief If I build me
a tomb on the mountaintop shall they not break it open If I dig me a
grave in the riverbed shall they not tear it up Verily they are keen
as bloodhounds to seek out their prey and for them are my wounds red
that they may drink Canst thou not hear them what they sing

And they sang as they went in between the scarlet curtains of the
Cathedral door for the procession was over and all the roses were
strewn


 Ave verum Corpus natum
 De Maria Virgine
 Vere passum immolatum
 In cruce pro homine
 Cujus latus perforatum
 Undam fluxit cum sanguinae
 Esto nobis praegustatum
 Mortis in examinae


And when they had left off singing he entered at the doorway and
passed between the silent rows of monks and priests where they knelt
each man in his place with the lighted candles uplifted And he saw
their hungry eyes fixed on the sacred Body that he bore and he knew why
they bowed their heads as he passed For the dark stream ran down the
folds of his white vestments and on the stones of the Cathedral floor
his footsteps left a deep red stain

So he passed up the nave to the chancel rails and there the bearers
paused and he went out from under the canopy and up to the altar steps
To left and right the whiterobed acolytes knelt with their censers and
the chaplains with their torches and their eyes shone greedily in the
flaring light as they watched the Body of the Victim

And as he stood before the altar holding aloft with bloodstained hands
the torn and mangled body of his murdered love the voices of the guests
bidden to the Eucharistic feast rang out in another peal of song


 Oh salutaris Hostia
 Quae coeli pandis ostium
 Bella praemunt hostilia
 Da robur fer auxilium


Ah and now they come to take the BodyGo then dear heart to thy
bitter doom and open the gates of heaven for these ravening wolves that
will not be denied The gates that are opened for me are the gates of
the nethermost hell

And as the deacon of honour placed the sacred vessel on the altar
Montanelli sank down where he had stood and knelt upon the step and
from the white altar above him the blood flowed down and dripped upon
his head And the voices of the singers rang on pealing under the
arches and echoing along the vaulted roof


 Uni trinoque Domino
 Sit sempiterna gloria
 Qui vitam sine termino
 Nobis donet in patria


Sine terminosine termino Oh happy Jesus Who could sink beneath
His cross Oh happy Jesus Who could say It is finished This doom
is never ended it is eternal as the stars in their courses This is the
worm that dieth not and the fire that is not quenched Sine termino
sine termino

Wearily patiently he went through his part in the remaining
ceremonies fulfilling mechanically from old habit the rites that had
no longer any meaning for him Then after the benediction he knelt
down again before the altar and covered his face and the voice of the
priest reading aloud the list of indulgences swelled and sank like a
faroff murmur from a world to which he belonged no more

The voice broke off and he stood up and stretched out his hand for
silence Some of the congregation were moving towards the doors and
they turned back with a hurried rustle and murmur as a whisper went
through the Cathedral

His Eminence is going to speak

His ministers startled and wondering drew closer to him and one of
them whispered hastily Your Eminence do you intend to speak to the
people now

Montanelli silently waved him aside The priests drew back whispering
together the thing was unusual even irregular but it was within
the Cardinals prerogative if he chose to do it No doubt he had some
statement of exceptional importance to make some new reform from Rome
to announce or a special communication from the Holy Father

Montanelli looked down from the altarsteps upon the sea of upturned
faces Full of eager expectancy they looked up at him as he stood above
them spectral and still and white

Shsh Silence the leaders of the procession called softly and the
murmuring of the congregation died into stillness as a gust of wind
dies among whispering treetops All the crowd gazed up in breathless
silence at the white figure on the altarsteps Slowly and steadily he
began to speak

It is written in the Gospel according to St John God so loved the
world that He gave His only begotten Son that the world through Him
might be saved

This is the festival of the Body and Blood of the Victim who was slain
for your salvation the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the
world the Son of God Who died for your transgressions And you are
assembled here in solemn festival array to eat of the sacrifice that
was given for you and to render thanks for this great mercy And I know
that this morning when you came to share in the banquet to eat of the
Body of the Victim your hearts were filled with joy as you remembered
the Passion of God the Son Who died that you might be saved

But tell me which among you has thought of that other Passionof the
Passion of God the Father Who gave His Son to be crucified Which of
you has remembered the agony of God the Father when He bent from His
throne in the heavens above and looked down upon Calvary

I have watched you today my people as you walked in your ranks in
solemn procession and I have seen that your hearts are glad within you
for the remission of your sins and that you rejoice in your salvation
Yet I pray you that you consider at what price that salvation was
bought Surely it is very precious and the price of it is above rubies
it is the price of blood

A faint long shudder passed through the listening crowd In the chancel
the priests bent forward and whispered to one another but the preacher
went on speaking and they held their peace

Therefore it is that I speak with you this day I AM THAT I AM For I
looked upon your weakness and your sorrow and upon the little children
about your feet and my heart was moved to compassion for their sake
that they must die Then I looked into my dear sons eyes and I knew
that the Atonement of Blood was there And I went my way and left him
to his doom

This is the remission of sins He died for you and the darkness has
swallowed him up he is dead and there is no resurrection he is dead
and I have no son Oh my boy my boy

The Cardinals voice broke in a long wailing cry and the voices of the
terrified people answered it like an echo All the clergy had risen from
their places and the deacons of honour started forward to lay their
hands on the preachers arm But he wrenched it away and faced them
suddenly with the eyes of an angry wild beast

What is this Is there not blood enough Wait your turn jackals you
shall all be fed

They shrank away and huddled shivering together their panting
breath thick and loud their faces white with the whiteness of chalk
Montanelli turned again to the people and they swayed and shook before
him as a field of corn before a hurricane

You have killed him You have killed him And I suffered it because I
would not let you die And now when you come about me with your lying
praises and your unclean prayers I repent meI repent me that I have
done this thing It were better that you all should rot in your vices
in the bottomless filth of damnation and that he should live What is
the worth of your plaguespotted souls that such a price should be paid
for them But it is too latetoo late I cry aloud but he does not
hear me I beat at the door of the grave but he will not wake I stand
alone in desert space and look around me from the bloodstained earth
where the heart of my heart lies buried to the void and awful heaven
that is left unto me desolate I have given him up oh generation of
vipers I have given him up for you

Take your salvation since it is yours I fling it to you as a bone is
flung to a pack of snarling curs The price of your banquet is paid for
you come then and gorge yourselves cannibals bloodsuckerscarrion
beasts that feed on the dead See where the blood streams down from the
altar foaming and hot from my darlings heartthe blood that was shed
for you Wallow and lap it and smear yourselves red with it Snatch and
fight for the flesh and devour itand trouble me no more This is the
body that was given for youlook at it torn and bleeding throbbing
still with the tortured life quivering from the bitter deathagony
take it Christians and eat

He had caught up the sun with the Host and lifted it above his head and
now flung it crashing down upon the floor At the ring of the metal on
stone the clergy rushed forward together and twenty hands seized the
madman

Then and only then the silence of the people broke in a wild
hysterical scream and overturning chairs and benches beating at the
doorways trampling one upon another tearing down curtains and garlands
in their haste the surging sobbing human flood poured out upon the
street



EPILOGUE


GEMMA theres a man downstairs who wants to see you Martini spoke in
the subdued tone which they had both unconsciously adopted during these
last ten days That and a certain slow evenness of speech and movement
were the sole expression which either of them gave to their grief

Gemma with bare arms and an apron over her dress was standing at a
table putting up little packages of cartridges for distribution She
had stood over the work since early morning and now in the glaring
afternoon her face looked haggard with fatigue

A man Cesare What does he want

I dont know dear He wouldnt tell me He said he must speak to you
alone

Very well She took off her apron and pulled down the sleeves of her
dress I must go to him I suppose but very likely its only a spy

In any case I shall be in the next room within call As soon as
you get rid of him you had better go and lie down a bit You have been
standing too long today

Oh no I would rather go on working

She went slowly down the stairs Martini following in silence She had
grown to look ten years older in these few days and the gray streak
across her hair had widened into a broad band She mostly kept her eyes
lowered now but when by chance she raised them he shivered at the
horror in their shadows

In the little parlour she found a clumsylooking man standing with his
heels together in the middle of the floor His whole figure and the
halffrightened way he looked up when she came in suggested to her that
he must be one of the Swiss guards He wore a countrymans blouse
which evidently did not belong to him and kept glancing round as though
afraid of detection

Can you speak German he asked in the heavy Zurich patois

A little I hear you want to see me

You are Signora Bolla Ive brought you a letter

Aletter She was beginning to tremble and rested one hand on the
table to steady herself

Im one of the guard over there He pointed out of the window to the
fortress on the hill Its fromthe man that was shot last week He
wrote it the night before I promised him Id give it into your own hand
myself

She bent her head down So he had written after all

Thats why Ive been so long bringing it the soldier went on He
said I was not to give it to anyone but you and I couldnt get off
beforethey watched me so I had to borrow these things to come in

He was fumbling in the breast of his blouse The weather was hot and
the sheet of folded paper that he pulled out was not only dirty and
crumpled but damp He stood for a moment shuffling his feet uneasily
then put up one hand and scratched the back of his head

You wont say anything he began again timidly with a distrustful
glance at her Its as much as my lifes worth to have come here

Of course I shall not say anything No wait a minute

As he turned to go she stopped him feeling for her purse but he drew
back offended

I dont want your money he said roughly I did it for himbecause
he asked me to Id have done more than that for him Hed been good to
meGod help me

The little catch in his voice made her look up He was slowly rubbing a
grimy sleeve across his eyes

We had to shoot he went on under his breath my mates and I A man
must obey orders We bungled it and had to fire againand he laughed
at ushe called us the awkward squadand hed been good to me

There was silence in the room A moment later he straightened himself
up made a clumsy military salute and went away

She stood still for a little while with the paper in her hand then
sat down by the open window to read The letter was closely written in
pencil and in some parts hardly legible But the first two words stood
out quite clear upon the page and they were in English

Dear Jim

The writing grew suddenly blurred and misty And she had lost him
againhad lost him again At the sight of the familiar childish
nickname all the hopelessness of her bereavement came over her afresh
and she put out her hands in blind desperation as though the weight of
the earthclods that lay above him were pressing on her heart

Presently she took up the paper again and went on reading


I am to be shot at sunrise tomorrow So if I am to keep at all my
promise to tell you everything I must keep it now But after all
there is not much need of explanations between you and me We always
understood each other without many words even when we were little
things

And so you see my dear you had no need to break your heart over
that old story of the blow It was a hard hit of course but I have had
plenty of others as hard and yet I have managed to get over themeven
to pay back a few of themand here I am still like the mackerel in
our nurserybook I forget its name Alive and kicking oh This
is my last kick though and then tomorrow morning andFinita la
Commedia You and I will translate that The variety show is over
and will give thanks to the gods that they have had at least so much
mercy on us It is not much but it is something and for this and all
other blessings may we be truly thankful

About that same tomorrow morning I want both you and Martini to
understand clearly that I am quite happy and satisfied and could ask no
better thing of Fate Tell that to Martini as a message from me he is a
good fellow and a good comrade and he will understand You see dear
I know that the stickinthemud people are doing us a good turn and
themselves a bad one by going back to secret trials and executions so
soon and I know that if you who are left stand together steadily and
hit hard you will see great things As for me I shall go out into
the courtyard with as light a heart as any child starting home for the
holidays I have done my share of the work and this deathsentence is
the proof that I have done it thoroughly They kill me because they are
afraid of me and what more can any mans heart desire

It desires just one thing more though A man who is going to die has
a right to a personal fancy and mine is that you should see why I have
always been such a sulky brute to you and so slow to forget old scores
Of course though you understand why and I tell you only for the
pleasure of writing the words I loved you Gemma when you were an ugly
little girl in a gingham frock with a scratchy tucker and your hair in
a pigtail down your back and I love you still Do you remember that
day when I kissed your hand and when you so piteously begged me never
to do that again It was a scoundrelly trick to play I know but you
must forgive that and now I kiss the paper where I have written your
name So I have kissed you twice and both times without your consent

That is all Goodbye my dear


There was no signature but a verse which they had learned together as
children was written under the letter


 Then am I
 A happy fly
 If I live
 Or if I die

 

Half an hour later Martini entered the room and startled out of the
silence of half a lifetime threw down the placard he was carrying and
flung his arms about her

Gemma What is it for Gods sake Dont sob like thatyou that never
cry Gemma Gemma my darling

Nothing Cesare I will tell you afterwardsIcant talk about it
just now

She hurriedly slipped the tearstained letter into her pocket and
rising leaned out of the window to hide her face Martini held his
tongue and bit his moustache After all these years he had betrayed
himself like a schoolboyand she had not even noticed it

The Cathedral bell is tolling she said after a little while looking
round with recovered selfcommand Someone must be dead

That is what I came to show you Martini answered in his everyday
voice He picked up the placard from the floor and handed it to her
Hastily printed in large type was a blackbordered announcement that
Our dearly beloved Bishop His Eminence the Cardinal Monsignor Lorenzo
Montanelli had died suddenly at Ravenna from the rupture of an
aneurism of the heart

She glanced up quickly from the paper and Martini answered the unspoken
suggestion in her eyes with a shrug of his shoulders

What would you have Madonna Aneurism is as good a word as any other
