Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

We need your donations more than ever

Project Gutenbergs Etext of Shakespeares The first Part of
Henry the Sixt




Executive Directors Notes

In addition to the notes below and so you will NOT think all
the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
been corrected here are the first few lines of Hamlet as they
are presented herein

 Barnardo Whos there
 Fran Nay answer me Stand  vnfold
your selfe

 Bar Long liue the King



As I understand it the printers often ran out of certain words
or letters they had often packed into a cliche  this is the
original meaning of the term cliche  and thus being unwilling
to unpack the cliches and thus you will see some substitutions
that look very odd  such as the exchanges of u for v v for u
above  and you may wonder why they did it this way presuming
Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner   

The answer is that they MAY have packed liue into a cliche at a
time when they were out of vs  possibly having used vv in
place of some ws etc This was a common practice of the day
as print was still quite expensive and they didnt want to spend
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to

You will find a lot of these kinds of errors in this text as I
have mentioned in other times and places many scholars have an
extreme attachment to these errors and many have accorded them a
very high place in the canon of Shakespeare My father read an
assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
purpose To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
  in great detail  and determined from the various changes
that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
variety of errors we credit him for even though he was infamous
for signing his name with several different spellings

So please take this into account when reading the comments below
made by our volunteer who prepared this file you may see errors
that are not errors   

So  with this caveat  we have NOT changed the canon errors
here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeares The first
Part of Henry the Sixt

Scanners Notes What this is and isnt This was taken from
a copy of Shakespeares first folio and it is as close as I can
come in ASCII to the printed text

The elongated Ss have been changed to small ss and the
conjoined ae have been changed to ae I have left the spelling
punctuation capitalization as close as possible to the
printed text I have corrected some spelling mistakes I have put
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
Geneva Bible and Shakespeares First Folio and have unified
spellings according to this template typos and expanded
abbreviations as I have come across them Everything within
brackets  is what I have added So if you dont like that
you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
purer Shakespeare

Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
differences between various copies of the first folio So there may
be differences other than what I have mentioned above between
this and other first folio editions This is due to the printers
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
continuing the printing run The proof run wasnt thrown away but
incorporated into the printed copies This is just the way it is
The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
First Folio editions best pages

If you find any scanning errors out and out typos punctuation
errors or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
free to email me those errors I wish to make this the best
etext possible My email address for right now are haraddaaolcom
and davidrinconnectcom I hope that you enjoy this

The Two Gentlemen of Verona

Actus primus Scena prima

Valentine Protheus and Speed

 Valentine Cease to perswade my louing Protheus
Homekeeping youth haue euer homely wits
Wert not affection chaines thy tender dayes
To the sweet glaunces of thy honourd Loue
I rather would entreat thy company
To see the wonders of the world abroad
Then liuing dully sluggardizd at home
Weare out thy youth with shapelesse idlenesse
But since thou loust loue still and thriue therein
Euen as I would when I to loue begin

 Pro Wilt thou be gone Sweet Valentine adew
Thinke on thy Protheus when thou haply seest
Some rare noteworthy obiect in thy trauaile
Wish me partaker in thy happinesse
When thou dost meet good hap and in thy danger
If euer danger doe enuiron thee
Commend thy grieuance to my holy prayers
For I will be thy beadesman Valentine

 Val And on a louebooke pray for my successe

 Pro Vpon some booke I loue Ile pray for thee

 Val Thats on some shallow Storie of deepe loue
How yong Leander crost the Hellespont

 Pro Thats a deepe Storie of a deeper loue
For he was more then ouershooes in loue

 Val Tis true for you are ouerbootes in loue
And yet you neuer swom the Hellespont

 Pro Ouer the Bootes nay giue me not the Boots

 Val No I will not for it boots thee not

 Pro What

 Val To be in loue where scorne is bought with grones
Coy looks with hartsore sighes one fading moments mirth
With twenty watchfull weary tedious nights
If haply won perhaps a haplesse gaine
If lost why then a grieuous labour won
How euer but a folly bought with wit
Or else a wit by folly vanquished

 Pro So by your circumstance you call me foole

 Val So by your circumstance I feare youll proue

 Pro Tis Loue you cauill at I am not Loue

 Val Loue is your master for he masters you
And he that is so yoked by a foole
Me thinkes should not be chronicled for wise

 Pro Yet Writers say as in the sweetest Bud
The eating Canker dwels so eating Loue
Inhabits in the finest wits of all

 Val And Writers say as the most forward Bud
Is eaten by the Canker ere it blow
Euen so by Loue the yong and tender wit
Is turnd to folly blasting in the Bud
Loosing his verdure euen in the prime
And all the faire effects of future hopes
But wherefore waste I time to counsaile thee
That art a votary to fond desire
Once more adieu my Father at the Road
Expects my comming there to see me shipd

 Pro And thither will I bring thee Valentine

 Val Sweet Protheus no Now let vs take our leaue
To Millaine let me heare from thee by Letters
Of thy successe in loue and what newes else
Betideth here in absence of thy Friend
And I likewise will visite thee with mine

 Pro All happinesse bechance to thee in Millaine

 Val As much to you at home and so farewell

Enter

 Pro He after Honour hunts I after Loue
He leaues his friends to dignifie them more
I loue my selfe my friends and all for loue
Thou Iulia thou hast metamorphisd me
Made me neglect my Studies loose my time
Warre with good counsaile set the world at nought
Made Wit with musing weake hart sick with thought

 Sp Sir Protheus saue you saw you my Master

 Pro But now he parted hence to embarque for Millain

 Sp Twenty to one then he is shipd already
And I haue plaid the Sheepe in loosing him

 Pro Indeede a Sheepe doth very often stray
And if the Shepheard be awhile away

 Sp You conclude that my Master is a Shepheard then
and I Sheepe

 Pro I doe

 Sp Why then my hornes are his hornes whether I
wake or sleepe

 Pro A silly answere and fitting well a Sheepe

 Sp This proues me still a Sheepe

 Pro True and thy Master a Shepheard

 Sp Nay that I can deny by a circumstance

 Pro It shall goe hard but ile proue it by another

 Sp The Shepheard seekes the Sheepe and not the
Sheepe the Shepheard but I seeke my Master and my
Master seekes not me therefore I am no Sheepe

 Pro The Sheepe for fodder follow the Shepheard
the Shepheard for foode followes not the Sheepe thou
for wages followest thy Master thy Master for wages
followes not thee therefore thou art a Sheepe

 Sp Such another proofe will make me cry baa

 Pro But dost thou heare gaust thou my Letter
to Iulia

 Sp I Sir I a lostMutton gaue your Letter to her
a lacdMutton and she a lacdMutton gaue mee a
lostMutton nothing for my labour

 Pro Heres too small a Pasture for such store of
Muttons

 Sp If the ground be ouerchargd you were best
sticke her

 Pro Nay in that you are astray twere best pound
you

 Sp Nay Sir lesse then a pound shall serue me for carrying
your Letter

 Pro You mistake I meane the pound a Pinfold

 Sp From a pound to a pin fold it ouer and ouer
Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your louer

 Pro But what said she

 Sp I

 Pro NodI why thats noddy

 Sp You mistooke Sir I say she did nod
And you aske me if she did nod and I say I

 Pro And that set together is noddy

 Sp Now you haue taken the paines to set it together
take it for your paines

 Pro No no you shall haue it for bearing the letter

 Sp Well I perceiue I must be faine to beare with you

 Pro Why Sir how doe you beare with me

 Sp Marry Sir the letter very orderly
Hauing nothing but the word noddy for my paines

 Pro Beshrew me but you haue a quicke wit

 Sp And yet it cannot ouertake your slow purse

 Pro Come come open the matter in briefe what
said she

 Sp Open your purse that the money and the matter
may be both at once deliuered

 Pro Well Sir here is for your paines what said she

 Sp Truely Sir I thinke youll hardly win her

 Pro Why couldst thou perceiue so much from her

 Sp Sir I could perceiue nothing at all from her
No not so much as a ducket for deliuering your letter
And being so hard to me that brought your minde
I feare shell proue as hard to you in telling your minde
Giue her no token but stones for shes as hard as steele

 Pro What said she nothing

 Sp No not so much as take this for thy pains
To testifie your bounty I thank you you haue cesternd me
In requital whereof henceforth carry your letters your
selfe And so Sir Ile commend you to my Master

 Pro Go go be gone to saue your Ship from wrack
Which cannot perish hauing thee aboarde
Being destind to a drier death on shore
I must goe send some better Messenger
I feare my Iulia would not daigne my lines
Receiuing them from such a worthlesse post

Scoena Secunda

Enter Iulia and Lucetta

 Iul But say Lucetta now we are alone
Wouldst thou then counsaile me to fall in loue

 Luc I Madam so you stumble not vnheedfully

 Iul Of all the faire resort of Gentlemen
That euery day with parle encounter me
In thy opinion which is worthiest loue

 Lu Please you repeat their names ile shew my minde
According to my shallow simple skill

 Iu What thinkst thou of the faire sir Eglamoure
 Lu As of a Knight wellspoken neat and fine
But were I you he neuer should be mine

 Iu What thinkst thou of the rich Mercatio
 Lu Well of his wealth but of himselfe so so

 Iu What thinkst thou of the gentle Protheus
 Lu Lord Lord to see what folly raignes in vs

 Iu How now what meanes this passion at his name
 Lu Pardon deare Madam tis a passing shame
That I vnworthy body as I am
Should censure thus on louely Gentlemen

 Iu Why not on Protheus as of all the rest
 Lu Then thus of many good I thinke him best

 Iul Your reason
 Lu I haue no other but a womans reason
I thinke him so because I thinke him so

 Iul And wouldst thou haue me cast my loue on him
 Lu I if you thought your loue not cast away


 Iul Why he of all the rest hath neuer moud me

 Lu Yet he of all the rest I thinke best loues ye

 Iul His little speaking shewes his loue but small

 Lu Fire thats closest kept burnes most of all

 Iul They doe not loue that doe not shew their loue

 Lu Oh they loue least that let men know their loue

 Iul I would I knew his minde

 Lu Peruse this paper Madam

 Iul To Iulia say from whom
 Lu That the Contents will shew

 Iul Say say who gaue it thee
 Lu Sir Valentines page  sent I think from Protheus
He would haue giuen it you but I being in the way
Did in your name receiue it pardon the fault I pray

 Iul Now by my modesty a goodly Broker
Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines
To whisper and conspire against my youth
Now trust me tis an office of great worth
And you an officer fit for the place
There take the paper see it be returnd
Or else returne no more into my sight

 Lu To plead for loue deserues more fee then hate

 Iul Will ye be gon
 Lu That you may ruminate

Enter

 Iul And yet I would I had orelookd the Letter
It were a shame to call her backe againe
And pray her to a fault for which I chid her
What foole is she that knowes I am a Maid
And would not force the letter to my view
Since Maides in modesty say no to that
Which they would haue the profferer construe I
Fie fie how wayward is this foolish loue
That like a testie Babe will scratch the Nurse
And presently all humbled kisse the Rod
How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence
When willingly I would haue had her here
How angerly I taught my brow to frowne
When inward ioy enforcd my heart to smile
My pennance is to call Lucetta backe
And aske remission for my folly past
What hoe Lucetta

 Lu What would your Ladiship
 Iul Ist neere dinner time
 Lu I would it were
That you might kill your stomacke on your meat
And not vpon your Maid

 Iu What ist that you
Tooke vp so gingerly
 Lu Nothing

 Iu Why didst thou stoope then
 Lu To take a paper vp that I let fall

 Iul And is that paper nothing
 Lu Nothing concerning me

 Iul Then let it lye for those that it concernes

 Lu Madam it will not lye where it concernes
Vnlesse it haue a false Interpreter

 Iul Some loue of yours hath writ to you in Rime

 Lu That I might sing it Madam to a tune
Giue me a Note your Ladiship can set
 Iul As little by such toyes as may be possible
Best sing it to the tune of Light O Loue

 Lu It is too heauy for so light a tune

 Iu Heauy belike it hath some burden then
 Lu I and melodious were it would you sing it
 Iu And why not you
 Lu I cannot reach so high

 Iu Lets see your Song
How now Minion
 Lu Keepe tune there still so you will sing it out
And yet me thinkes I do not like this tune

 Iu You doe not
 Lu No Madam tis too sharpe

 Iu You Minion are too saucie

 Lu Nay now you are too flat
And marre the concord with too harsh a descant
There wanteth but a Meane to fill your Song

 Iu The meane is dround with you vnruly base

 Lu Indeede I bid the base for Protheus

 Iu This babble shall not henceforth trouble me
Here is a coile with protestation
Goe get you gone and let the papers lye
You would be fingring them to anger me

 Lu She makes it strange but she would be best pleasd
To be so angred with another Letter

 Iu Nay would I were so angred with the same
Oh hatefull hands to teare such louing words
Iniurious Waspes to feede on such sweet hony
And kill the Bees that yeelde it with your stings
Ile kisse each seuerall paper for amends
Looke here is writ kinde Iulia vnkinde Iulia
As in reuenge of thy ingratitude
I throw thy name against the bruzingstones
Trampling contemptuously on thy disdaine
And here is writ Loue wounded Protheus
Poore wounded name my bosome as a bed
Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heald
And thus I search it with a soueraigne kisse
But twice or thrice was Protheus written downe
Be calme good winde blow not a word away
Till I haue found each letter in the Letter
Except mine own name That some whirlewinde beare
Vnto a ragged fearefull hanging Rocke
And throw it thence into the raging Sea
Loe here in one line is his name twice writ
Poore forlorne Protheus passionate Protheus
To the sweet Iulia that ile teare away
And yet I will not sith so prettily
He couples it to his complaining Names
Thus will I fold them one vpon another
Now kisse embrace contend doe what you will

 Lu Madam dinner is ready and your father staies

 Iu Well let vs goe

 Lu What shall these papers lye like Teltales here
 Iu If you respect them best to take them vp

 Lu Nay I was taken vp for laying them downe
Yet here they shall not lye for catching cold

 Iu I see you haue a months minde to them

 Lu I Madam you may say what sights you see
I see things too although you iudge I winke

 Iu Come come wilt please you goe

Exeunt


Scoena Tertia


Enter Antonio and Panthino Protheus

 Ant Tell me Panthino what sad talke was that
Wherewith my brother held you in the Cloyster
 Pan Twas of his Nephew Protheus your Sonne

 Ant Why what of him
 Pan He wondred that your Lordship
Would suffer him to spend his youth at home
While other men of slender reputation
Put forth their Sonnes to seeke preferment out
Some to the warres to try their fortune there
Some to discouer Islands farre away
Some to the studious Vniuersities
For any or for all these exercises
He said that Protheus your sonne was meet
And did request me to importune you
To let him spend his time no more at home
Which would be great impeachment to his age
In hauing knowne no trauaile in his youth

 Ant Nor needst thou much importune me to that
Whereon this month I haue bin hamering
I haue considerd well his losse of time
And how he cannot be a perfect man
Not being tryed and tutord in the world
Experience is by industry atchieud
And perfected by the swift course of time
Then tell me whether were I best to send him
 Pan I thinke your Lordship is not ignorant
How his companion youthfull Valentine
Attends the Emperour in his royall Court

 Ant I know it well

 Pan Twere good I thinke your Lordship sent him
thither
There shall he practise Tilts and Turnaments
Heare sweet discourse conuerse with Noblemen
And be in eye of euery Exercise
Worthy his youth and noblenesse of birth

 Ant I like thy counsaile well hast thou aduisd
And that thou maist perceiue how well I like it
The execution of it shall make knowne
Euen with the speediest expedition
I will dispatch him to the Emperors Court

 Pan To morrow may it please you Don Alphonso
With other Gentlemen of good esteeme
Are iournying to salute the Emperor
And to commend their seruice to his will

 Ant Good company with them shall Protheus go
And in good time now will we breake with him

 Pro Sweet Loue sweet lines sweet life
Here is her hand the agent of her heart
Here is her oath for loue her honors paune
O that our Fathers would applaud our loues
To seale our happinesse with their consents

 Pro Oh heauenly Iulia

 Ant How now What Letter are you reading there
 Pro Mayt please your Lordship tis a word or two
Of commendations sent from Valentine
Deliuerd by a friend that came from him

 Ant Lend me the Letter Let me see what newes

 Pro There is no newes my Lord but that he writes
How happily he liues how wellbeloud
And daily graced by the Emperor
Wishing me with him partner of his fortune

 Ant And how stand you affected to his wish
 Pro As one relying on your Lordships will
And not depending on his friendly wish

 Ant My will is something sorted with his wish
Muse not that I thus sodainly proceed
For what I will I will and there an end
I am resolud that thou shalt spend some time
With Valentinus in the Emperors Court
What maintenance he from his friends receiues
Like exhibition thou shalt haue from me
To morrow be in readinesse to goe
Excuse it not for I am peremptory

 Pro My Lord I cannot be so soone prouided
Please you deliberate a day or two

 Ant Look what thou wantst shalbe sent after thee
No more of stay to morrow thou must goe
Come on Panthino you shall be imployd
To hasten on his Expedition

 Pro Thus haue I shund the fire for feare of burning
And drenchd me in the sea where I am drownd
I feard to shew my Father Iulias Letter
Least he should take exceptions to my loue
And with the vantage of mine owne excuse
Hath he excepted most against my loue
Oh how this spring of loue resembleth
The vncertaine glory of an Aprill day
Which now shewes all the beauty of the Sun
And by and by a clowd takes all away

 Pan Sir Protheus your Fathers calls for you
He is in hast therefore I pray you go

 Pro Why this it is my heart accords thereto
And yet a thousand times it answers no

Ah Siluia Siluia

 Speed Madam Siluia Madam Siluia

 Val How now Sirha
 Speed Shee is not within hearing Sir

 Val Why sir who bad you call her
 Speed Your worship sir or else I mistooke

 Val Well youll still be too forward

 Speed And yet I was last chidden for being too slow

 Val Goe to sir tell me do you know Madam Siluia
 Speed Shee that your worship loues
 Val Why how know you that I am in loue
 Speed Marry by these speciall markes first you haue
learnd like Sir Protheus to wreath your Armes like a
Malecontent to rellish a Louesong like a Robinredbreast
to walke alone like one that had the pestilence
to sigh like a Schooleboy that had lost his ABC to
weep like a yong wench that had buried her Grandam
to fast like one that takes diet to watch like one that
feares robbing to speake puling like a beggar at HallowMasse
You were wont when you laughed to crow
like a cocke when you walkd to walke like one of the
Lions when you fasted it was presently after dinner
when you lookd sadly it was for want of money And
now you are Metamorphisd with a Mistris that when I
looke on you I can hardly thinke you my Master

 Val Are all these things perceiud in me
 Speed They are all perceiud without ye

 Val Without me they cannot

 Speed Without you nay thats certaine for without
you were so simple none else would but you are
so without these follies that these follies are within you
and shine through you like the water in an Vrinall that
not an eye that sees you but is a Physician to comment
on your Malady

 Val But tell me dost thou know my Lady Siluia
 Speed Shee that you gaze on so as she sits at supper
 Val Hast thou obserud that euen she I meane

 Speed Why sir I know her not

 Val Dost thou know her by my gazing on her and
yet knowst her not
 Speed Is she not hardfauourd sir
 Val Not so faire boy as well fauourd

 Speed Sir I know that well enough

 Val What dost thou know
 Speed That shee is not so faire as of you wellfauourd
 Val I meane that her beauty is exquisite
But her fauour infinite

 Speed Thats because the one is painted and the other
out of all count

 Val How painted and how out of count
 Speed Marry sir so painted to make her faire that no
man counts of her beauty

 Val How esteemst thou me I account of her beauty

 Speed You neuer saw her since she was deformd

 Val How long hath she beene deformd
 Speed Euer since you loud her

 Val I haue loud her euer since I saw her
And still I see her beautifull

 Speed If you loue her you cannot see her

 Val Why
 Speed Because Loue is blinde O that you had mine
eyes or your owne eyes had the lights they were wont
to haue when you chidde at Sir Protheus for going vngarterd

 Val What should I see then
 Speed Your owne present folly and her passing deformitie
for hee beeing in loue could not see to garter
his hose and you beeing in loue cannot see to put on
your hose

 Val Belike boy then you are in loue for last morning
You could not see to wipe my shooes

 Speed True sir I was in loue with my bed I thanke
you you swingd me for my loue which makes mee the
bolder to chide you for yours

 Val In conclusion I stand affected to her

 Speed I would you were set so your affection would
cease

 Val Last night she enioynd me
To write some lines to one she loues

 Speed And haue you
 Val I haue

 Speed Are they not lamely writt
 Val No Boy but as well as I can do them
Peace here she comes

 Speed Oh excellent motion oh exceeding Puppet
Now will he interpret to her

 Val Madam  Mistres a thousand goodmorrows

 Speed Oh giue yegoodevn heers a million of
manners

 Sil Sir Valentine and seruant to you two thousand

 Speed He should giue her interest  she giues it him

 Val As you inioynd me I haue writ your Letter
Vnto the secret nameles friend of yours
Which I was much vnwilling to proceed in
But for my duty to your Ladiship

 Sil I thanke you gentle Seruant tis very Clerklydone

 Val Now trust me Madam it came hardlyoff
For being ignorant to whom it goes
I writ at randome very doubtfully

 Sil Perchance you think too much of so much pains
 Val No Madam so it steed you I will write
Please you command a thousand times as much
And yet 
 Sil A pretty period well I ghesse the sequell
And yet I will not name it and yet I care not
And yet take this againe and yet I thanke you
Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more

 Speed And yet you will and yet another yet

 Val What meanes your Ladiship
Doe you not like it
 Sil Yes yes the lines are very queintly writ
But since vnwillingly take them againe
Nay take them

 Val Madam they are for you

 Silu I I you writ them Sir at my request
But I will none of them they are for you
I would haue had them writ more mouingly
 Val Please you Ile write your Ladiship another

 Sil And when its writ for my sake read it ouer
And if it please you so if not why so
 Val If it please me Madam what then
 Sil Why if it please you take it for your labour
And so goodmorrow Seruant

Exit Sil

 Speed Oh Iest vnseene inscrutible inuisible
As a nose on a mans face or a Wethercocke on a steeple
My Master sues to her and she hath taught her Sutor
He being her Pupill to become her Tutor
Oh excellent deuise was there euer heard a better
That my master being scribe
To himselfe should write the Letter
 Val How now Sir
What are you reasoning with your selfe
 Speed Nay I was riming tis you y haue the reason

 Val To doe what
 Speed To be a Spokesman from Madam Siluia

 Val To whom
 Speed To your selfe why she woes you by a figure

 Val What figure
 Speed By a Letter I should say

 Val Why she hath not writ to me
 Speed What need she
When shee hath made you write to your selfe
Why doe you not perceiue the iest
 Val No beleeue me

 Speed No beleeuing you indeed sir
But did you perceiue her earnest
 Val She gaue me none except an angry word

 Speed Why she hath giuen you a Letter

 Val Thats the Letter I writ to her friend

 Speed And y letter hath she deliuerd  there an end

 Val I would it were no worse

 Speed Ile warrant you tis as well
For often haue you writ to her and she in modesty
Or else for want of idle time could not againe reply
Or fearing els some messenger y might her mind discouer
Her self hath taught her Loue himself to write vnto her louer
All this I speak in print for in print I found it
Why muse you sir tis dinner time

 Val I haue dynd

 Speed I but hearken sir though the Cameleon Loue
can feed on the ayre I am one that am nourishd by my
victuals and would faine haue meate oh bee not like
your Mistresse be moued be moued

 Val Tis indeed Madam we thank the giuer

 Sil Who is that Seruant
 Val Your selfe sweet Lady for you gaue the fire
Sir Thurio borrows his wit from your Ladiships lookes
And spends what he borrowes kindly in your company

 Thu Sir if you spend word for word with me I shall
make your wit bankrupt

 Val I know it well sir you haue an Exchequer of words
And I thinke no other treasure to giue your followers
For it appeares by their bare Liueries
That they liue by your bare words

 Sil No more gentlemen no more
Here comes my father

 Duk Now daughter Siluia you are hard beset
Sir Valentine your father is in good health
What say you to a Letter from your friends
Of much good newes
 Val My Lord I will be thankfull
To any happy messenger from thence

 Duk Know ye Don Antonio your Countriman
 Val I my good Lord I know the Gentleman
To be of worth and worthy estimation
And not without desert so well reputed

 Duk Hath he not a Sonne
 Val I my good Lord a Son that well deserues
The honor and regard of such a father

 Duk You know him well
 Val I knew him as my selfe for from our Infancie
We haue conuerst and spent our howres together
And though my selfe haue beene an idle Trewant
Omitting the sweet benefit of time
To cloath mine age with Angellike perfection
Yet hath Sir Protheus for thats his name
Made vse and faire aduantage of his daies
His yeares but yong but his experience old
His head vnmellowed but his Iudgement ripe
And in a word for far behinde his worth
Comes all the praises that I now bestow
He is compleat in feature and in minde
With all good grace to grace a Gentleman

 Duk Beshrew me sir but if he make this good
He is as worthy for an Empresse loue
As meet to be an Emperors Councellor
Well Sir this Gentleman is come to me
With Commendation from great Potentates
And heere he meanes to spend his time a while
I thinke tis no vnwelcome newes to you

 Val Should I haue wishd a thing it had beene he

 Duk Welcome him then according to his worth
Siluia I speake to you and you Sir Thurio
For Valentine I need not cite him to it
I will send him hither to you presently

 Val This is the Gentleman I told your Ladiship
Had come along with me but that his Mistresse
Did hold his eyes lockt in her Christall lookes

 Sil Belike that now she hath enfranchisd them
Vpon some other pawne for fealty

 Val Nay sure I thinke she holds them prisoners stil

 Sil Nay then he should be blind and being blind
How could he see his way to seeke out you
 Val Why Lady Loue hath twenty paire of eyes

 Thur They say that Loue hath not an eye at all

 Val To see such Louers Thurio as your selfe
Vpon a homely obiect Loue can winke

 Sil Haue done haue done here comes y gentleman

 Val Welcome deer Protheus Mistris I beseech you
Confirme his welcome with some speciall fauor

 Sil His worth is warrant for his welcome hether
If this be he you oft haue wishd to heare from

 Val Mistris it is sweet Lady entertaine him
To be my fellowseruant to your Ladiship

 Sil Too low a Mistres for so high a seruant

 Pro Not so sweet Lady but too meane a seruant
To haue a looke of such a worthy a Mistresse

 Val Leaue off discourse of disabilitie
Sweet Lady entertaine him for your Seruant

 Pro My dutie will I boast of nothing else

 Sil And dutie neuer yet did want his meed
Seruant you are welcome to a worthlesse Mistresse

 Pro Ile die on him that saies so but your selfe

 Sil That you are welcome
 Pro That you are worthlesse

 Thur Madam my Lord your father wold speak with you

 Sil I wait vpon his pleasure Come Sir Thurio
Goe with me once more new Seruant welcome
Ile leaue you to confer of home affaires
When you haue done we looke too heare from you

 Pro Weell both attend vpon your Ladiship

 Val Now tell me how do al from whence you came
 Pro Your frends are wel  haue them much commended

 Val And how doe yours
 Pro I left them all in health

 Val How does your Lady  how thriues your loue
 Pro My tales of Loue were wont to weary you
I know you ioy not in a Louediscourse

 Val I Protheus but that life is alterd now
I haue done pennance for contemning Loue
Whose high emperious thoughts haue punishd me
With bitter fasts with penitentiall grones
With nightly teares and daily hartsore sighes
For in reuenge of my contempt of loue
Loue hath chasd sleepe from my enthralled eyes
And made them watchers of mine owne hearts sorrow
O gentle Protheus Loues a mighty Lord
And hath so humbled me as I confesse
There is no woe to his correction
Nor to his Seruice no such ioy on earth
Now no discourse except it be of loue
Now can I breake my fast dine sup and sleepe
Vpon the very naked name of Loue

 Pro Enough I read your fortune in your eye
Was this the Idoll that you worship so
 Val Euen She and is she not a heauenly Saint
 Pro No But she is an earthly Paragon

 Val Call her diuine

 Pro I will not flatter her

 Val O flatter me for Loue delights in praises

 Pro When I was sick you gaue me bitter pils
And I must minister the like to you

 Val Then speake the truth by her if not diuine
Yet let her be a principalitie
Soueraigne to all the Creatures on the earth

 Pro Except my Mistresse

 Val Sweet except not any
Except thou wilt except against my Loue

 Pro Haue I not reason to prefer mine owne
 Val And I will help thee to prefer her to
Shee shall be dignified with this high honour
To beare my Ladies traine lest the base earth
Should from her vesture chance to steale a kisse
And of so great a fauor growing proud
Disdaine to roote the Sommerswelling flowre
And make rough winter euerlastingly

 Pro Why Valentine what Bragadisme is this
 Val Pardon me Protheus all I can is nothing
To her whose worth make other worthies nothing
Shee is alone

 Pro Then let her alone

 Val Not for the world why man she is mine owne
And I as rich in hauing such a Iewell
As twenty Seas if all their sand were pearle
The water Nectar and the Rocks pure gold
Forgiue me that I doe not dreame on thee
Because thou seest me doate vpon my loue
My foolish Riuall that her Father likes
Onely for his possessions are so huge
Is gone with her along and I must after
For Loue thou knowst is full of iealousie
 Pro But she loues you
 Val I and we are betroathd nay more our mariage howre
With all the cunning manner of our flight
Determind of how I must climbe her window
The Ladder made of Cords and all the means
Plotted and greed on for my happinesse
Good Protheus goe with me to my chamber
In these affaires to aid me with thy counsaile

 Pro Goe on before I shall enquire you forth
I must vnto the Road to disembarque
Some necessaries that I needs must vse
And then Ile presently attend you

 Val Will you make haste

Enter

 Pro I will
Euen as one heate another heate expels
Or as one naile by strength driues out another
So the remembrance of my former Loue
Is by a newer obiect quite forgotten
It is mine or Valentines praise
Her true perfection or my false transgression
That makes me reasonlesse to reason thus
Shee is faire and so is Iulia that I loue
That I did loue for now my loue is thawd
Which like a waxen Image gainst a fire
Beares no impression of the thing it was
Me thinkes my zeale to Valentine is cold
And that I loue him not as I was wont
O but I loue his Lady tootoo much
And thats the reason I loue him so little
How shall I doate on her with more aduice
That thus without aduice begin to loue her
Tis but her picture I haue yet beheld
And that hath dazeld my reasons light
But when I looke on her perfections
There is no reason but I shall be blinde
If I can checke my erring loue I will
If not to compasse her Ile vse my skill

Who art the Table wherein all my thoughts
Are visibly Characterd and engraud
To lesson me and tell me some good meane
How with my honour I may vndertake
A iourney to my louing Protheus

 Luc Alas the way is wearisome and long

 Iul A truedeuoted Pilgrime is not weary
To measure Kingdomes with his feeble steps
Much lesse shall she that hath Loues wings to flie
And when the flight is made to one so deere
Of such diuine perfection as Sir Protheus

 Luc Better forbeare till Protheus make returne

 Iul Oh knowst y not his looks are my soules food
Pitty the dearth that I haue pined in
By longing for that food so long a time
Didst thou but know the inly touch of Loue
Thou wouldst as soone goe kindle fire with snow
As seeke to quench the fire of Loue with words

 Luc I doe not seeke to quench your Loues hot fire
But qualifie the fires extreame rage
Lest it should burne aboue the bounds of reason

 Iul The more thou damst it vp the more it burnes
The Current that with gentle murmure glides
Thou knowst being stopd impatiently doth rage
But when his faire course is not hindered
He makes sweet musicke with th enameld stones
Giuing a gentle kisse to euery sedge
He ouertaketh in his pilgrimage
And so by many winding nookes he straies
With willing sport to the wilde Ocean
Then let me goe and hinder not my course
Ile be as patient as a gentle streame
And make a pastime of each weary step
Till the last step haue brought me to my Loue
And there Ile rest as after much turmoile
A blessed soule doth in Elizium

 Luc But in what habit will you goe along
 Iul Not like a woman for I would preuent
The loose encounters of lasciuious men
Gentle Lucetta fit me with such weedes
As may beseeme some well reputed Page

 Luc Why then your Ladiship must cut your haire

 Iul No girle Ile knit it vp in silken strings
With twentie odconceited trueloue knots
To be fantastique may become a youth
Of greater time then I shall shew to be

 Luc What fashion Madam shall I make your breeches
 Iul That fits as well as tell me good my Lord
What compasse will you weare your Farthingale
Why eun what fashion thou best likes Lucetta
 Luc You must needs haue them with a codpeece Madam
 Iul Out out Lucetta that wilbe illfauourd

 Luc A round hose Madam nows not worth a pin
Vnlesse you haue a codpeece to stick pins on

 Iul Lucetta as thou loust me let me haue
What thou thinkst meet and is most mannerly
But tell me wench how will the world repute me
For vndertaking so vnstaid a iourney
I feare me it will make me scandalizd

 Luc If you thinke so then stay at home and go not

 Iul Nay that I will not

 Luc Then neuer dreame on Infamy but go
If Protheus like your iourney when you come
No matter whos displeasd when you are gone
I feare me he will scarce be pleasd with all

 Iul That is the least Lucetta of my feare
A thousand oathes an Ocean of his teares
And instances of infinite of Loue
Warrant me welcome to my Protheus

 Luc All these are seruants to deceitfull men

 Iul Base men that vse them to so base effect
But truer starres did gouerne Protheus birth
His words are bonds his oathes are oracles
His loue sincere his thoughts immaculate
His teares pure messengers sent from his heart
His heart as far from fraud as heauen from earth

 Luc Pray heaun he proue so when you come to him

 Iul Now as thou loust me do him not that wrong
To beare a hard opinion of his truth
Onely deserue my loue by louing him
And presently goe with me to my chamber
To take a note of what I stand in need of
To furnish me vpon my longing iourney
All that is mine I leaue at thy dispose
My goods my Lands my reputation
Onely in lieu thereof dispatch me hence
Come answere not but to it presently
I am impatient of my tarriance

Enter Duke Thurio Protheus Valentine Launce Speed

 Duke Sir Thurio giue vs leaue I pray a while
We haue some secrets to confer about
Now tell me Protheus whats your will with me
 Pro My gracious Lord that which I wold discouer
The Law of friendship bids me to conceale
But when I call to minde your gracious fauours
Done to me vndeseruing as I am
My dutie pricks me on to vtter that
Which else no worldly good should draw from me
Know worthy Prince Sir Valentine my friend
This night intends to steale away your daughter
My selfe am one made priuy to the plot
I know you haue determind to bestow her
On Thurio whom your gentle daughter hates
And should she thus be stolne away from you
It would be much vexation to your age
Thus for my duties sake I rather chose
To crosse my friend in his intended drift
Then by concealing it heap on your head
A pack of sorrowes which would presse you downe
Being vnpreuented to your timelesse graue

 Duke Protheus I thank thee for thine honest care
Which to requite command me while I liue
This loue of theirs my selfe haue often seene
Haply when they haue iudgd me fast asleepe
And oftentimes haue purposd to forbid
Sir Valentine her companie and my Court
But fearing lest my iealous ayme might erre
And so vnworthily disgrace the man
A rashnesse that I euer yet haue shund
I gaue him gentle lookes thereby to finde
That which thy selfe hast now disclosd to me
And that thou maist perceiue my feare of this
Knowing that tender youth is soone suggested
I nightly lodge her in an vpper Towre
The key whereof my selfe haue euer kept
And thence she cannot be conuayd away

 Pro Know noble Lord they haue deuisd a meane
How he her chamberwindow will ascend
And with a Cordedladder fetch her downe
For which the youthfull Louer now is gone
And this way comes he with it presently
Where if it please you you may intercept him
But good my Lord doe it so cunningly
That my discouery be not aimed at
For loue of you not hate vnto my friend
Hath made me publisher of this pretence

 Duke Vpon mine Honor he shall neuer know
That I had any light from thee of this

 Pro Adiew my Lord Sir Valentine is comming

 Duk Sir Valentine whether away so fast
 Val Please it your Grace there is a Messenger
That stayes to beare my Letters to my friends
And I am going to deliuer them

 Duk Be they of much import
 Val The tenure of them doth but signifie
My health and happy being at your Court

 Duk Nay then no matter stay with me a while
I am to breake with thee of some affaires
That touch me neere wherein thou must be secret
Tis not vnknown to thee that I haue sought
To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter

 Val I know it well my Lord and sure the Match
Were rich and honourable besides the gentleman
Is full of Vertue Bounty Worth and Qualities
Beseeming such a Wife as your faire daughter
Cannot your Grace win her to fancie him
 Duk No trust me She is peeuish sullen froward
Prowd disobedient stubborne lacking duty
Neither regarding that she is my childe
Nor fearing me as if I were her father
And may I say to thee this pride of hers
Vpon aduice hath drawne my loue from her
And where I thought the remnant of mine age
Should haue beene cherishd by her childlike dutie
I now am full resolud to take a wife
And turne her out to who will take her in
Then let her beauty be her wedding dowre
For me and my possessions she esteemes not

 Val What would your Grace haue me to do in this
 Duk There is a Lady in Verona heere
Whom I affect but she is nice and coy
And naught esteemes my aged eloquence
Now therefore would I haue thee to my Tutor
For long agone I haue forgot to court
Besides the fashion of the time is changd
How and which way I may bestow my selfe
To be regarded in her sunbright eye

 Val Win her with gifts if she respect not words
Dumbe Iewels often in their silent kinde
More then quicke words doe moue a womans minde

 Duk But she did scorne a present that I sent her
 Val A woman somtime scorns what best contents her
Send her another neuer giue her ore
For scorne at first makes afterloue the more
If she doe frowne tis not in hate of you
But rather to beget more loue in you
If she doe chide tis not to haue you gone
For why the fooles are mad if left alone
Take no repulse what euer she doth say
For get you gon she doth not meane away
Flatter and praise commend extoll their graces
Though nere so blacke say they haue Angells faces
That man that hath a tongue I say is no man
If with his tongue he cannot win a woman

 Duk But she I meane is promisd by her friends
Vnto a youthfull Gentleman of worth
And kept seuerely from resort of men
That no man hath accesse by day to her

 Val Why then I would resort to her by night

 Duk I but the doores be lockt and keyes kept safe
That no man hath recourse to her by night

 Val What letts but one may enter at her window
 Duk Her chamber is aloft far from the ground
And built so sheluing that one cannot climbe it
Without apparant hazard of his life

 Val Why then a Ladder quaintly made of Cords
To cast vp with a paire of anchoring hookes
Would serue to scale another Heros towre
So bold Leander would aduenture it

 Duk Now as thou art a Gentleman of blood
Aduise me where I may haue such a Ladder

 Val When would you vse it pray sir tell me that

 Duk This very night for Loue is like a childe
That longs for euery thing that he can come by

 Val By seauen a clock ile get you such a Ladder

 Duk But harke thee I will goe to her alone
How shall I best conuey the Ladder thither
 Val It will be light my Lord that you may beare it
Vnder a cloake that is of any length

 Duk A cloake as long as thine will serue the turne
 Val I my good Lord

 Duk Then let me see thy cloake
Ile get me one of such another length

 Val Why any cloake will serue the turn my Lord
 Duk How shall I fashion me to weare a cloake
I pray thee let me feele thy cloake vpon me
What Letter is this same whats here to Siluia
And heere an Engine fit for my proceeding
Ile be so bold to breake the seale for once
My thoughts do harbour with my Siluia nightly
And slaues they are to me that send them flying
Oh could their Master come and goe as lightly
Himselfe would lodge where senceles they are lying
My Herald Thoughts in thy pure bosome restthem
While I their King that thither them importune
Doe curse the grace that with such grace hath blest them
Because my selfe doe want my seruants fortune
I curse my selfe for they are sent by me
That they should harbour where their Lord should be
Whats here Siluia this night I will enfranchise thee
Tis so and heeres the Ladder for the purpose
Why Phaeton for thou art Merops sonne
Wilt thou aspire to guide the heauenly Car
And with thy daring folly burne the world
Wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee
Goe base Intruder ouerweening Slaue
Bestow thy fawning smiles on equall mates
And thinke my patience more then thy desert
Is priuiledge for thy departure hence
Thanke me for this more then for all the fauors
Which all toomuch I haue bestowed on thee
But if thou linger in my Territories
Longer then swiftest expedition
Will giue thee time to leaue our royall Court
By heauen my wrath shall farre exceed the loue
I euer bore my daughter or thy selfe
Be gone I will not heare thy vaine excuse
But as thou loust thy life make speed from hence

 Val And why not death rather then liuing torment
To die is to be banisht from my selfe
And Siluia is my selfe banishd from her
Is selfe from selfe A deadly banishment
What light is light if Siluia be not seene
What ioy is ioy if Siluia be not by
Vnlesse it be to thinke that she is by
And feed vpon the shadow of perfection
Except I be by Siluia in the night
There is no musicke in the Nightingale
Vnlesse I looke on Siluia in the day
There is no day for me to looke vpon
Shee is my essence and I leaue to be
If I be not by her faire influence
Fosterd illumind cherishd kept aliue
I flie not death to flie his deadly doome
Tarry I heere I but attend on death
But flie I hence I flie away from life

 Pro Run boy run run and seeke him out

 Lau Sohough Soa hough
 Pro What seest thou
 Lau Him we goe to finde
Theres not a haire ons head but tis a Valentine

 Pro Valentine
 Val No

 Pro Who then his Spirit
 Val Neither
 Pro What then
 Val Nothing

 Lau Can nothing speake Master shall I strike
 Pro Who wouldst thou strike
 Lau Nothing

 Pro Villaine forbeare

 Lau Why Sir Ile strike nothing I pray you

 Pro Sirha I say forbeare friend Valentine a word

 Val My eares are stopt  cannot hear good newes
So much of bad already hath possest them

 Pro Then in dumbe silence will I bury mine
For they are harsh vntuneable and bad

 Val Is Siluia dead
 Pro No Valentine

 Val No Valentine indeed for sacred Siluia
Hath she forsworne me
 Pro No Valentine

 Val No Valentine if Siluia haue forsworne me
What is your newes
 Lau Sir there is a proclamation y you are vanished

 Pro That thou art banishd oh thats the newes
From hence from Siluia and from me thy friend

 Val Oh I haue fed vpon this woe already
And now excesse of it will make me surfet
Doth Siluia know that I am banishd
 Pro I I and she hath offered to the doome
Which vnreuerst stands in effectuall force
A Sea of melting pearle which some call teares
Those at her fathers churlish feete she tenderd
With them vpon her knees her humble selfe
Wringing her hands whose whitenes so became them
As if but now they waxed pale for woe
But neither bended knees pure hands held vp
Sad sighes deepe grones nor siluershedding teares
Could penetrate her vncompassionate Sire
But Valentine if he be tane must die
Besides her intercession chafd him so
When she for thy repeale was suppliant
That to close prison he commanded her
With many bitter threats of biding there

 Val No more vnles the next word that thou speakst
Haue some malignant power vpon my life
If so I pray thee breath it in mine eare
As ending Antheme of my endlesse dolor

 Pro Cease to lament for that thou canst not helpe
And study helpe for that which thou lamentst
Time is the Nurse and breeder of all good
Here if thou stay thou canst not see thy loue
Besides thy staying will abridge thy life
Hope is a louers staffe walke hence with that
And manage it against despairing thoughts
Thy letters may be here though thou art hence
Which being writ to me shall be deliuerd
Euen in the milkewhite bosome of thy Loue
The time now serues not to expostulate
Come Ile conuey thee through the Citygate
And ere I part with thee confer at large
Of all that may concerne thy Loueaffaires
As thou loust Siluia though not for thy selfe
Regard thy danger and along with me

 Val I pray thee Launce and if thou seest my Boy
Bid him make haste and meet me at the Northgate

 Pro Goe sirha finde him out Come Valentine

 Val Oh my deere Siluia haplesse Valentine

 Launce I am but a foole looke you and yet I haue

Enter Duke Thurio Protheus

 Du Sir Thurio feare not but that she will loue you
Now Valentine is banishd from her sight

 Th Since his exile she hath despisd me most
Forsworne my company and raild at me
That I am desperate of obtaining her

 Du This weake impresse of Loue is as a figure
Trenched in ice which with an houres heate
Dissolues to water and doth loose his forme
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts
And worthlesse Valentine shall be forgot
How now sir Protheus is your countriman
According to our Proclamation gon
 Pro Gon my good Lord

 Du My daughter takes his going grieuously
 Pro A little time my Lord will kill that griefe

 Du So I beleeue but Thurio thinkes not so
Protheus the good conceit I hold of thee
For thou hast showne some signe of good desert
Makes me the better to confer with thee

 Pro Longer then I proue loyall to your Grace
Let me not liue to looke vpon your Grace

 Du Thou knowst how willingly I would effect
The match betweene sir Thurio and my daughter
 Pro I doe my Lord

 Du And also I thinke thou art not ignorant
How she opposes her against my will
 Pro She did my Lord when Valentine was here

 Du I and peruersly she perseuers so
What might we doe to make the girle forget
The loue of Valentine and loue sir Thurio
 Pro The best way is to slander Valentine
With falsehood cowardize and poore discent
Three things that women highly hold in hate

 Du I but shell thinke that it is spoke in hate

 Pro I if his enemy deliuer it
Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
By one whom she esteemeth as his friend

 Du Then you must vndertake to slander him

 Pro And that my Lord I shall be loath to doe
Tis an ill office for a Gentleman
Especially against his very friend

 Du Where your good word cannot aduantage him
Your slander neuer can endamage him
Therefore the office is indifferent
Being intreated to it by your friend

 Pro You haue preuaild my Lord if I can doe it
By ought that I can speake in his dispraise
She shall not long continue loue to him
But say this weede her loue from Valentine
It followes not that she will loue sir Thurio

 Th Therefore as you vnwinde her loue from him
Least it should rauell and be good to none
You must prouide to bottome it on me
Which must be done by praising me as much
As you in worth dispraise sir Valentine

 Du And Protheus we dare trust you in this kinde
Because we know on Valentines report
You are already loues firme votary
And cannot soone reuolt and change your minde
Vpon this warrant shall you haue accesse
Where you with Siluia may conferre at large
For she is lumpish heauy mellancholly
And for your friends sake will be glad of you
Where you may temper her by your perswasion
To hate yong Valentine and loue my friend

 Pro As much as I can doe I will effect
But you sir Thurio are not sharpe enough
You must lay Lime to tangle her desires
By walefull Sonnets whose composed Rimes
Should be full fraught with seruiceable vowes

 Du I much is the force of heauenbred Poesie

 Pro Say that vpon the altar of her beauty
You sacrifice your teares your sighes your heart
Write till your inke be dry and with your teares
Moist it againe and frame some feeling line
That may discouer such integrity
For Orpheus Lute was strung with Poets sinewes
Whose golden touch could soften steele and stones
Make Tygers tame and huge Leuiathans
Forsake vnsounded deepes to dance on Sands
After your direlamenting Elegies
Visit by night your Ladies chamberwindow
With some sweet Consort To their Instruments
Tune a deploring dumpe the nights dead silence
Will well become such sweet complaining grieuance
This or else nothing will inherit her

 Du This discipline showes thou hast bin in loue

 Th And thy aduice this night ile put in practise
Therefore sweet Protheus my directiongiuer
Let vs into the City presently
To sort some Gentlemen well skild in Musicke
I haue a Sonnet that will serue the turne
To giue the onset to thy good aduise

 Du About it Gentlemen

 Pro Well wait vpon your Grace till after Supper
And afterward determine our proceedings

 Du Euen now about it I will pardon you

On silly women or poore passengers

Come goe with vs well bring thee to our Crewes
And show thee all the Treasure we haue got

 Pro Already haue I bin false to Valentine
And now I must be as vniust to Thurio
Vnder the colour of commending him
I haue accesse my owne loue to prefer
But Siluia is too faire too true too holy
To be corrupted with my worthlesse guifts
When I protest true loyalty to her
She twits me with my falsehood to my friend
When to her beauty I commend my vowes
She bids me thinke how I haue bin forsworne
In breaking faith with Iulia whom I loud
And notwithstanding all her sodaine quips
The least whereof would quell a louers hope
Yet Spaniellike the more she spurnes my loue
The more it growes and fawneth on her still

To helpe him of his blindnesse
And being helpd inhabits there
Then to Siluia let vs sing
That Siluia is excelling
She excels each mortall thing
Vpon the dull earth dwelling

Returne returne and make thy loue amends
For me by this pale queene of night I sweare
I am so farre from granting thy request
That I despise thee for thy wrongfull suite
And by and by intend to chide my selfe
Euen for this time I spend in talking to thee

 Pro I grant sweet loue that I did loue a Lady

Vouchsafe me yet your Picture for my loue

And make it but a shadow as I am

 Sil I am very loath to be your Idoll Sir

To worship shadowes and adore false shapes

I did the thing you wot of he makes me no more adoe
but whips me out of the chamber how many Masters
would doe this for his Seruant nay ile be sworne I haue
sat in the stockes for puddings he hath stolne otherwise
he had bin executed I haue stood on the Pillorie for
Geese he hath kild otherwise he had sufferd fort thou
thinkst not of this now nay I remember the tricke you
serud me when I tooke my leaue of Madam Siluia did
not I bid thee still marke me and doe as I do when didst
thou see me heaue vp my leg and make water against a
Gentlewomans farthingale didst thou euer see me doe
such a tricke
 Pro Sebastian is thy name I like thee well
And will imploy thee in some seruice presently

 Iu In what you please ile doe what I can

 Pro I hope thou wilt
How now you whorson pezant
Where haue you bin these two dayes loytering
 La Marry Sir I carried Mistris Siluia the dogge you

 Pro And what saies she to my little Iewell
 La Marry she saies your dog was a cur and tels you
currish thanks is good enough for such a present

 Pro But she receiud my dog
 La No indeede did she not
Here haue I brought him backe againe

 Pro What didst thou offer her this from me
 La I Sir the other Squirrill was stolne from me
By the Hangmans boyes in the market place
And then I offerd her mine owne who is a dog
As big as ten of yours  therefore the guift the greater

 Pro Goe get thee hence and finde my dog againe
Or nere returne againe into my sight
Away I say stayest thou to vexe me here
A Slaue that still an end turnes me to shame
Sebastian I haue entertained thee
Partly that I haue neede of such a youth
That can with some discretion doe my businesse
For tis no trusting to yond foolish Lowt
But chiefely for thy face and thy behauiour
Which if my Augury deceiue me not
Witnesse good bringing vp fortune and truth
Therefore know thee for this I entertaine thee
Go presently and take this Ring with thee
Deliuer it to Madam Siluia
She loud me well deliuerd it to me

 Iul It seemes you loud not her not leaue her token
She is dead belike
 Pro Not so I thinke she liues

 Iul Alas

 Pro Why dost thou cry alas
 Iul I cannot choose but pitty her

 Pro Wherefore shouldst thou pitty her
 Iul Because me thinkes that she loud you as well
As you doe loue your Lady Siluia
She dreames on him that has forgot her loue
You doate on her that cares not for your loue
Tis pitty Loue should be so contrary
And thinking on it makes me cry alas

 Pro Well giue her that Ring and therewithall
This Letter thats her chamber Tell my Lady
I claime the promise for her heauenly Picture
Your message done hye home vnto my chamber
Where thou shalt finde me sad and solitarie

 Iul How many women would doe such a message
Alas poore Protheus thou hast entertaind
A Foxe to be the Shepheard of thy Lambs
Alas poore foole why doe I pitty him
That with his very heart despiseth me
Because he loues her he despiseth me
Because I loue him I must pitty him
This Ring I gaue him when he parted from me
To binde him to remember my good will
And now am I vnhappy Messenger
To plead for that which I would not obtaine
To carry that which I would haue refusd
To praise his faith which I would haue dispraisd
I am my Masters true confirmed Loue
But cannot be true seruant to my Master
Vnlesse I proue false traitor to my selfe
Yet will I woe for him but yet so coldly
As heauen it knowes I would not haue him speed
Gentlewoman good day I pray you be my meane
To bring me where to speake with Madam Siluia

 Sil What would you with her if that I be she
 Iul If you be she I doe intreat your patience
To heare me speake the message I am sent on

 Sil From whom
 Iul From my Master Sir Protheus Madam

 Sil Oh he sends you for a Picture
 Iul I Madam

 Sil Vrsula bring my Picture there
Goe giue your Master this tell him from me
One Iulia that his changing thoughts forget
Would better fit his Chamber then this Shadow

 Iul Madam please you peruse this Letter
Pardon me Madam I haue vnaduisd
Deliuerd you a paper that I should not
This is the Letter to your Ladiship

 Sil I pray thee let me looke on that againe

 Iul It may not be good Madam pardon me

 Sil There hold
I will not looke vpon your Masters lines
I know they are stuft with protestations
And full of newfound oathes which he will breake
As easily as I doe teare his paper

 Iul Madam he sends your Ladiship this Ring

 Sil The more shame for him that he sends it me
For I haue heard him say a thousand times
His Iulia gaue it him at his departure
Though his false finger haue prophand the Ring
Mine shall not doe his Iulia so much wrong

 Iul She thankes you

 Sil What saist thou
 Iul I thanke you Madam that you tender her
Poore Gentlewoman my Master wrongs her much

 Sil Dost thou know her
 Iul Almost as well as I doe know my selfe
To thinke vpon her woes I doe protest
That I haue wept a hundred seuerall times

 Sil Belike she thinks that Protheus hath forsook her
 Iul I thinke she doth and thats her cause of sorrow

 Sil Is she not passing faire
 Iul She hath bin fairer Madam then she is
When she did thinke my Master loud her well
She in my iudgement was as faire as you
But since she did neglect her lookingglasse
And threw her Sunexpelling Masque away
The ayre hath starud the roses in her cheekes
And pinchd the lillytincture of her face
That now she is become as blacke as I

 Sil How tall was she
 Iul About my stature for at Pentecost
When all our Pageants of delight were plaid
Our youth got me to play the womans part
And I was trimd in Madam Iulias gowne
Which serued me as fit by all mens iudgements
As if the garment had bin made for me
Therefore I know she is about my height
And at that time I made her weepe a good
For I did play a lamentable part
Madam twas Ariadne passioning
For Thesus periury and vniust flight
Which I so liuely acted with my teares
That my poore Mistris moued therewithall
Wept bitterly and would I might be dead
If I in thought felt not her very sorrow

 Sil She is beholding to thee gentle youth
Alas poore Lady desolate and left
I weepe my selfe to thinke vpon thy words
Here youth there is my purse I giue thee this
For thy sweet Mistris sake because thou loust her Farewell

 Iul And she shall thanke you fort if ere you know her
A vertuous gentlewoman milde and beautifull
I hope my Masters suit will be but cold
Since she respects my Mistris loue so much
Alas how loue can trifle with it selfe
Here is her Picture let me see I thinke
If I had such a Tyre this face of mine
Were full as louely as is this of hers
And yet the Painter flatterd her a little
Vnlesse I flatter with my selfe too much
Her haire is Aburne mine is perfect Yellow
If that be all the difference in his loue
Ile get me such a coulourd Perrywig
Her eyes are grey as glasse and so are mine
I but her foreheads low and mines as high
What should it be that he respects in her
But I can make respectiue in my selfe
If this fond Loue were not a blinded god
Come shadow come and take this shadow vp
For tis thy riuall O thou sencelesse forme
Thou shalt be worshipd kissd loud and adord
And were there sence in his Idolatry
My substance should be statue in thy stead
Ile vse thee kindly for thy Mistris sake
That vsd me so or else by Ioue I vow
I should haue scratchd out your vnseeing eyes
To make my Master out of loue with thee

Actus Quintus Scoena Prima

Enter Eglamoure Siluia

 Egl The Sun begins to guild the westerne skie
And now it is about the very houre
That Siluia at Fryer Patricks Cell should meet me
She will not faile for Louers breake not houres
Vnlesse it be to come before their time
So much they spur their expedition
See where she comes Lady a happy euening

 Sil Amen Amen goe on good Eglamoure
Out at the Posterne by the Abbey wall
I feare I am attended by some Spies

 Egl Feare not the Forrest is not three leagues off
If we recouer that we are sure enough

Scoena Secunda

Enter Thurio Protheus Iulia Duke

 Th Sir Protheus what saies Siluia to my suit
 Pro Oh Sir I finde her milder then she was
And yet she takes exceptions at your person

 Thu What that my leg is too long
 Pro No that it is too little

 Thu Ile weare a Boote to make it somewhat rounder

 Pro But loue will not be spurd to what it loathes

 Thu What saies she to my face
 Pro She saies it is a faire one

 Thu Nay then the wanton lyes my face is blacke

 Pro But Pearles are faire and the old saying is
Blacke men are Pearles in beauteous Ladies eyes

 Thu Tis true such Pearles as put out Ladies eyes
For I had rather winke then looke on them

 Thu How likes she my discourse
 Pro Ill when you talke of war

 Thu But well when I discourse of loue and peace

 Iul But better indeede when you hold you peace

 Thu What sayes she to my valour
 Pro Oh Sir she makes no doubt of that

 Iul She needes not when she knowes it cowardize

 Thu What saies she to my birth
 Pro That you are well deriud

 Iul True from a Gentleman to a foole

 Thu Considers she my Possessions
 Pro Oh I and pitties them

 Thu Wherefore
 Iul That such an Asse should owe them

 Pro That they are out by Lease

 Iul Here comes the Duke

 Du How now sir Protheus how now Thurio
Which of you saw Eglamoure of late
 Thu Not I

 Pro Nor I

 Du Saw you my daughter
 Pro Neither

 Du Why then
Shes fled vnto that pezant Valentine
And Eglamoure is in her Company
Tis true for Frier Laurence met them both
As he in pennance wanderd through the Forrest
Him he knew well and guesd that it was she
But being maskd he was not sure of it
Besides she did intend Confession
At Patricks Cell this euen and there she was not
These likelihoods confirme her flight from hence
Therefore I pray you stand not to discourse
But mount you presently and meete with me
Vpon the rising of the Mountaine foote
That leads toward Mantua whether they are fled
Dispatch sweet Gentlemen and follow me

 Thu Why this it is to be a peeuish Girle
That flies her fortune when it followes her
Ile after more to be reuengd on Eglamoure
Then for the loue of recklesse Siluia

 Pro And I will follow more for Siluias loue
Then hate of Eglamoure that goes with her

 Iul And I will follow more to crosse that loue
Then hate for Siluia that is gone for loue

Scoena Quarta

Enter Valentine Protheus Siluia Iulia Duke Thurio Outlawes

 Val How vse doth breed a habit in a man
This shadowy desart vnfrequented woods
I better brooke then flourishing peopled Townes
Here can I sit alone vnseene of any
And to the Nightingales complaining Notes
Tune my distresses and record my woes
O thou that dost inhabit in my brest
Leaue not the Mansion so long Tenantlesse
Lest growing ruinous the building fall
And leaue no memory of what it was
Repaire me with thy presence Siluia
Thou gentle Nimph cherish thy forlorne swaine
What hallowing and what stir is this to day
These are my mates that make their wills their Law
Haue some vnhappy passenger in chace
They loue me well yet I haue much to doe
To keepe them from vnciuill outrages
Withdraw thee Valentine whos this comes heere
 Pro Madam this seruice I haue done for you
Though you respect not aught your seruant doth
To hazard life and reskew you from him
That would haue forcd your honour and your loue
Vouchsafe me for my meed but one faire looke
A smaller boone then this I cannot beg
And lesse then this I am sure you cannot giue
 Val How like a dreame is this I see and heare
Loue lend me patience to forbeare a while

 Sil O miserable vnhappy that I am

 Pro Vnhappy were you Madam ere I came
But by my comming I haue made you happy

 Sil By thy approach thou makst me most vnhappy

 Iul And me when he approcheth to your presence

 Sil Had I beene ceazed by a hungry Lion
I would haue beene a breakfast to the Beast
Rather then haue false Protheus reskue me
Oh heauen be iudge how I loue Valentine
Whose lifes as tender to me as my soule
And full as much for more there cannot be
I doe detest false periurd Protheus
Therefore be gone sollicit me no more

 Pro What dangerous action stood it next to death
Would I not vndergoe for one calme looke
Oh tis the curse in Loue and still approud
When women cannot loue where theyre beloud

 Sil When Protheus cannot loue where hes beloud
Read ouer Iulias heart thy first best Loue
For whose deare sake thou didst then rend thy faith
Into a thousand oathes and all those oathes
Descended into periury to loue me
Thou hast no faith left now vnlesse thoudst two
And thats farre worse then none better haue none
Then plurall faith which is too much by one
Thou Counterfeyt to thy true friend

 Pro In Loue
Who respects friend
 Sil All men but Protheus

 Pro Nay if the gentle spirit of mouing words
Can no way change you to a milder forme
Ile wooe you like a Souldier at armes end
And loue you gainst the nature of Loue force ye

 Sil Oh heauen

 Pro Ile force thee yeeld to my desire

 Val Ruffian let goe that rude vnciuill touch
Thou friend of an ill fashion

 Pro Valentine

 Val Thou common friend thats without faith or loue
For such is a friend now treacherous man
Thou hast beguild my hopes nought but mine eye
Could haue perswaded me now I dare not say
I haue one friend aliue thou wouldst disproue me
Who should be trusted when ones right hand
Is periured to the bosome Protheus
I am sorry I must neuer trust thee more
But count the world a stranger for thy sake
The priuate wound is deepest oh time most accurst
Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst
 Pro My shame and guilt confounds me
Forgiue me Valentine if hearty sorrow
Be a sufficient Ransome for offence
I tendert heere I doe as truely suffer
As ere I did commit

 Val Then I am paid
And once againe I doe receiue thee honest
Who by Repentance is not satisfied
Is nor of heauen nor earth for these are pleasd
By Penitence th Eternalls wraths appeasd
And that my loue may appeare plaine and free
All that was mine in Siluia I giue thee

 Iul Oh me vnhappy

 Pro Looke to the Boy

 Val Why Boy
Why wag how now whats the matter look vp speak

 Iul O good sir my master chargd me to deliuer a ring
to Madam Siluia w out of my neglect was neuer done

 Pro Where is that ring boy
 Iul Heere tis this is it

 Pro How let me see
Why this is the ring I gaue to Iulia

 Iul Oh cry you mercy sir I haue mistooke
This is the ring you sent to Siluia

 Pro But how camst thou by this ring at my depart
I gaue this vnto Iulia

 Iul And Iulia her selfe did giue it me
And Iulia her selfe hath brought it hither

 Pro How Iulia
 Iul Behold her that gaue ayme to all thy oathes
And entertaind em deepely in her heart
How oft hast thou with periury cleft the roote
Oh Protheus let this habit make thee blush
Be thou ashamd that I haue tooke vpon me
Such an immodest rayment if shame liue
In a disguise of loue
It is the lesser blot modesty findes
Women to change their shapes then men their minds

 Pro Then men their minds tis true oh heuen were man
But Constant he were perfect that one error
Fils him with faults makes him run through all th sins
Inconstancy fallsoff ere it begins
What is in Siluias face but I may spie
More fresh in Iulias with a constant eye
 Val Come come a hand from either
Let me be blest to make this happy close
Twere pitty two such friends should be long foes

 Pro Beare witnes heauen I haue my wish for euer

 Iul And I mine

 Outl A prize a prize a prize

 Val Forbeare forbeare I say It is my Lord the Duke
Your Grace is welcome to a man disgracd
Banished Valentine

 Duke Sir Valentine
 Thu Yonder is Siluia and Siluias mine

 Val Thurio giue backe or else embrace thy death
Come not within the measure of my wrath
Doe not name Siluia thine if once againe
Verona shall not hold thee heere she stands
Take but possession of her with a Touch
I dare thee but to breath vpon my Loue

 Thur Sir Valentine I care not for her I
I hold him but a foole that will endanger
His Body for a Girle that loues him not
I claime her not and therefore she is thine

 Duke The more degenerate and base art thou
To make such meanes for her as thou hast done
And leaue her on such slight conditions
Now by the honor of my Ancestry
I doe applaud thy spirit Valentine
And thinke thee worthy of an Empresse loue
Know then I heere forget all former greefes
Cancell all grudge repeale thee home againe
Plead a new state in thy vnriuald merit
To which I thus subscribe Sir Valentine
Thou art a Gentleman and well deriud
Take thou thy Siluia for thou hast deserud her

 Val I thank your Grace y gift hath made me happy
I now beseech you for your daughters sake
To grant one Boone that I shall aske of you

 Duke I grant it for thine owne what ere it be

 Val These banishd men that I haue kept withall
Are men endud with worthy qualities
Forgiue them what they haue committed here
And let them be recalld from their Exile
They are reformed ciuill full of good
And fit for great employment worthy Lord
 Duke Thou hast preuaild I pardon them and thee
Dispose of them as thou knowst their deserts
Come let vs goe we will include all iarres
With Triumphes Mirth and rare solemnity

 Val And as we walke along I dare be bold
With our discourse to make your Grace to smile
What thinke you of this Page my Lord
 Duke I think the Boy hath grace in him he blushes

 Val I warrant you my Lord more grace then Boy

 Duke What meane you by that saying
 Val Please you Ile tell you as we passe along
That you will wonder what hath fortuned
Come Protheus tis your pennance but to heare
The story of your Loues discouered
That done our day of marriage shall be yours
One Feast one house one mutuall happinesse
