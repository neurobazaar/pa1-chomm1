CHAPTER I

RUDOLPH OF TRULYRURALANIA

When I state that I was own brother to Lord Burleydon had an income of
two thousand a year could speak all the polite languages fluently was
a powerful swordsman a good shot and could ride anything from an
elephant to a clotheshorse I really think I have said enough to
satisfy any feminine novelreader of Bayswater or South Kensington that
I was a hero My brothers wife however did not seem to incline to
this belief

A more conceited selfsatisfied little cad I never met than you she
said Why dont you try to do something instead of sneering at others
who do You never take anything seriouslyexcept yourself which
isnt worth it You are proud of your red hair and peaked nose just
because you fondly believe that you got them from the Prince of
Trulyruralania and are willing to think evil of your ancestress to
satisfy your snobbish little soul Let me tell you sir that there
was no more truth about that than there was in that silly talk of her
partiality for her husbands redhaired gamekeeper in Scotland Ah
that makes you startdont it But I have always observed that a mule
is apt to remember only the horse side of his ancestry

Whenever my pretty sisterinlaw talks in this way I always try to
forget that she came of a family far inferior to our own the
Razorbills Indeed her peopleof the Nonconformist stockreally had
nothing but wealth and rectitude and I think my brother Bob in his
genuine love for her was willing to overlook the latter for the sake
of the former

My pretty sisterinlaws interest in my affairs always made me believe
that she secretly worshiped mealthough it was a fact as will be seen
in the progress of this story that most women blushed on my addressing
them I used to say it was the reflection of my red hair on a
transparent complexion which was rather neatwasnt it And subtle
But then I was always saying such subtle things

My dear Rose I said laying down my egg spoon the egg spoon really
had nothing to do with this speech but it imparted such a delightfully
realistic flavor to the scene Im not to blame if I resemble the
Shelpburgs

Its your being so beastly proud of it that I object to she replied
And for Heavens sake try to BE something and not merely resemble
things The fact is you resemble too muchyoure ALWAYS resembling
You resemble a man of fashion and youre not a wit and youre not a
soldier a sportsman a heroand youre none of em Altogether
youre not in the least convincing Now listen Theres a good
chance for you to go as our attache with Lord Mumblepeg the new
Ambassador to Cochin China In all the novels you know attaches are
always the confidants of Grand Duchesses and know more state secrets
than their chiefs in real life I believe they are something like a
city clerk with a leaning to private theatricals Say youll go Do

Ill take a few months holiday first I replied and then I added
in my gay dashing way if the place is openhang it if I dont go

Good old bounder she said and dont think too much of that
precious Prince Rupert He was a bad lot

She blushed again at meas her husband entered

Take Roses advice Rupert my boy he said and go

And that is how I came to go to Trulyruralania For I secretly
resolved to take my holiday in traveling in that country and trying as
dear Lady Burleydon put it really to be somebody instead of
resembling anybody in particular A precious lot SHE knew about it



CHAPTER II

IN WHICH MY HAIR CAUSES A LOT OF THINGS

You go to Trulyruralania from Charing Cross In passing through Paris
we picked up Mlle Beljambe who was going to Kohlslau the capital of
Trulyruralania to marry the Grand Duke Michael who however as I was
informed was in love with the Princess Flirtia She blushed on seeing
mebut I was told afterwards declined being introduced to me on any
account However I thought nothing of this and went on to Bock the
next station to Kohlslau At the little inn in the forest I was
informed I was just in time to see the coronation of the new king the
next day The landlady and her daughter were very communicative and
after the fashion of the simple guileless stage peasant instantly
informed me what everybody was doing and at once explained the
situation She told me that the Grand Duke Michaelor Black Michael
as he was calledhimself aspired to the throne as well as to the hand
of the Princess Flirtia but was hated by the populace who preferred
the young heir Prince Rupert because he had the hair and features of
the dynasty of the Shelpburgs which she added are singularly
like your own

But is red hair so very peculiar here I asked

Among the Jewsyes sire I mean yes SIR she corrected herself
You seldom see a redheaded Jew

The Jews I repeated in astonishment

Of course you know the Shelpburgs are descended directly from
Solomonand have indeed some of his matrimonial peculiarities she
said blushing

I was amazedbut recalled myself But why do they call the Duke of
Kohlslau Black Michael I asked carelessly

Because he is nearly black sir You see when the great Prince
Rupert went abroad in the old time he visited England Scotland and
Africa They say he married an African lady thereand that the Duke
is really more in the direct line of succession than Prince Rupert

But here the daughter showed me to my room She blushed of course
and apologized for not bringing a candle as she thought my hair was
sufficiently illuminating But she added with another blush I do
SO like it

I replied by giving her something of no valuea Belgian nickel which
wouldnt pass in Bock as I had found to my cost But my hair had
evidently attracted attention from others for on my return to the
guestroom a stranger approached me and in the purest and most precise
Germanthe Court or Olland Hof speechaddressed me

Have you the red hair of the fair King or the hair of your father

Luckily I was able to reply with the same purity and precision I have
both the hair of the fair King and my own But I have not the hair of
my father nor of Black Michael nor of the innkeeper nor the
innkeepers wife The red HEIR of the fair King would be a son

Possibly this delicate mot on the approaching marriage of the King was
lost in the translation for the stranger strode abruptly away I
learned however that the King was actually then in Bock at the
castle a few miles distant in the woods I resolved to stroll thither

It was a fine old mediaeval structure But as the singular incidents I
am about to relate combine the romantic and adventurous atmosphere of
the middle ages with all the appliances of modern times I may briefly
state that the castle was lit by electricity bad fireescapes on each
of the turrets four lifts and was fitted up by one of the best West
End establishments The sanitary arrangements were excellent and the
drainage of the most perfect order as I had reason to know personally
later I was so affected by the peaceful solitude that I lay down
under a tree and presently fell asleep I was awakened by the sound of
voices and looking up beheld two men bending over me One was a
grizzled veteran and the other a younger dandyfied man both were
dressed in shooting suits

Never saw such a resemblance before in all my life said the elder
man Pon my soul if the King hadnt got shaved yesterday because
the Princess Flirtia said his beard tickled her Id swear it was he

I could not help thinking how lucky it wasfor this narrativethat
the King HAD shaved otherwise my story would have degenerated into a
mere Comedy of Errors Opening my eyes I said boldly

Now that you are satisfied who I resemble gentlemen perhaps you will
tell me who you are

Certainly said the elder curtly I am Spitza simple colonel of
his Majestys yet nevertheless the one man who runs this whole
dynastyand this young gentleman is Fritz my lieutenant And you
are

My name is Razorbillbrother to Lord Burleydon I replied calmly

Good heavens another of the lot he muttered Then correcting
himself he said brusquely Any relation to that Englishwoman who was
so sweet on the old Rupert centuries ago

Here again I suppose my sisterinlaw would have had me knock down
the foreign insulter of my English ancestressbut I colored to the
roots of my hair and even fartherwith pleasure at this proof of my
royal descent And then a cheery voice was heard calling Spitz and
Fritz through the woods

The King said Spitz to Fritz quickly He must not see him

Too late said Fritz as a young man bounded lightly out of the
bushes

I was thunderstruck It was as if I had suddenly been confronted with
a mirrorand beheld myself Of course he was not quite so
goodlooking or so tall but he was still a colorable imitation I was
delighted

Nevertheless for a moment he did not seem to reciprocate my feeling
He stared at me staggered back and passed his hand across his
forehead Can it be he muttered thickly that Ive got em agin
Yet I only hadshingle glash

But Fritz quickly interposed

Your Majesty is all rightthough he added in a lower voice let
this be a warning to you for tomorrow This gentleman is Mr
Razorbillyou know the old story of the RazorbillsHa ha

But the King did not laugh he extended his hand and said gently You
are welcomemy cousin Indeed my sisterinlaw would have probably
said thatdissipated though he washe was the only gentleman there

I have come to see the coronation your Majesty I said

And you shall said the King heartily and shall go with us The
show cant begin without useh Spitz he added playfully poking the
veteran in the ribs whatever Michael may do

Then he linked his arms in Spitzs and mine Lets go to the hutand
have some supper and fizz he said gayly

We went to the hut We had supper We ate and drank heavily We
danced madly around the table Nevertheless I thought that Spitz and
Fritz were worried by the Kings potations and Spitz at last went so
far as to remind his Majesty that they were to start early in the
morning for Kohlslau I noticed also that as the King drank his speech
grew thicker and Spitz and Fritz exchanged glances At last Spitz said
with stern significance

Your Majesty has not forgotten the test invariably submitted to the
King at his coronation

Shertenly not replied the King with his reckless laugh The King
mush be able to pronounshname of his countryintellillilgibly
mush shay hic Im King ofKing ofTootootoorallooralanyer
He staggered laughed and fell under the table

He cannot say it gasped Fritz and Spitz in one voice He is lost

Unless said Fritz suddenly pointing at me with a flash of
intelligence HE can personate him and say it Can you he turned
to me brusquely

It was an awful moment I had been drinking heavily too but I
resolved to succeed Im King of Troolyrooly I murmured but I
could not master itI staggered and followed the King under the table

Is there no one here roared Spitz who can shave thish dynasty and
shay Tooral No  it I mean Trularlooral but he too
lurched hopelessly forward

No one can say Toorallooral muttered Fritz and grasping Spitz
in despair they both rolled under the table

How long we lay there Heaven knows I was awakened by Spitz playing
the garden hose on me He was booted and spurred with Fritz by his
side The King was lying on a bench saying feebly Blesh you my
chillen

By politely acceding to Black Michaels request to try our
oneandsix sherry he has been brought to this condition said Spitz
bitterly Its a trick to keep him from being crowned In this
country if the King is crowned while drunk the kingdom instantly
reverts to a villainno matter who But in this case the villain is
Black Michael Ha What say you lad Shall we frustrate the rascal
by having YOU personate the King

I waswellintoxicated at the thought But what would my
sisterinlaw say Would shein her Nonconformist
conscienceconsider it strictly honorable But I swept all scruples
aside A King was to be saved I will go I said Let us on to
Kohlslauriding like the wind We rode like the wind furiously
madly Mounted on a wild dashing bayknown familiarly as the Bay of
Biscay from its rough turbulenceI easily kept the lead But our
horses began to fail Suddenly Spitz halted clapped his hand to his
head and threw himself from his horse Fools he said we should
have taken the train It will get there an hour before we will He
pointed to a wayside station where the 715 excursion train for
Kohlslau was waiting

But how dreadfully unmediaevalWhat will the public say I began

Bother the public he said gruffly Whos running this dynastyyou
or I Come With the assistance of Fritz he tied up my face with a
handkerchief to simulate toothache and then with a shout of defiance
we three rushed madly into a closely packed thirdclass carriage

Never shall I forget the perils the fatigue the hopes and fears of
that mad journey Panting perspiring packed together with cheap
trippers but exalted with the one hope of saving the King we at last
staggered out on the Kohlslau platform utterly exhausted As we did so
we heard a distant roar from the city Fritz turned an ashen gray
Spitz a livid blue Are we too late he gasped as we madly fought
our way into the street where shouts of The King The King were
rending the air Can it be Black Michael But here the crowd
parted and a procession preceded by outriders flashed into the
square And there seated in a carriage beside the most beautiful
redhaired girl I had ever seen was the Kingthe King whom we had
left two hours ago dead drunk in the hut in the forest



CHAPTERS III TO XXII Inclusive

IN WHICH THINGS GET MIXED

We reeled against each other aghast Spitz recovered himself first
We must fly he said hoarsely If the King has discovered our
trickwe are lost

But where shall we go I asked

Back to the hut

We caught the next train to Bock An hour later we stood panting
within the hut Its walls and ceiling were splashed with sinister red
stains Blood I exclaimed joyfully At last we have a real
mediaeval adventure

Its Burgundy you fool growled Spitz good Burgundy wasted At
this moment Fritz appeared dragging in the hutkeeper

Where is the King demanded Spitz fiercely of the trembling peasant

He was carried away an hour ago by Black Michael and taken to the
castle

And when did he LEAVE the castle roared Spitz

He never left the castle sir and alas I fear never will alive
replied the man shuddering

We stared at each other Spitz bit his grizzled mustache So he
said bitterly Black Michael has simply anticipated us with the same
game We have been tricked I knew it could not be the King whom they
crowned No he added quickly I see it allit was Rupert of
Glasgow

Who is Rupert of Glasgow I cried

Oh I really cant go over all that family rot again grunted Spitz
Tell him Fritz

Then taking me aside Fritz delicately informed me that Rupert of
Glasgowa young Scotchmanclaimed equally with myself descent from
the old Rupert and that equally with myself he resembled the King
That Michael had got possession of him on his arrival in the country
kept him closely guarded in the castle and had hid his resemblance in
a black wig and false mustache that the young Scotchman however
seemed apparently devoted to Michael and his plots and there was
undoubtedly some secret understanding between them That it was
evidently Michaels trick to have the pretender crowned and then by
exposing the fraud and the condition of the real King excite the
indignation of the duped people and seat himself on the throne
But I burst out shall this baseborn pretender remain at Kohlslau
beside the beautiful Princess Flirtia Let us to Kohlslau at once and
hurl him from the throne

One pretender is as good as another said Spitz dryly But leave
HIM to me Tis the King we must protect and succor As for that
Scotch springald before midnight I shall have him kidnaped brought
back to his master in a close carriage and youYOU shall take his
place at Kohlslau

I will I said enthusiastically drawing my sword but I have done
nothing yet Please let me kill something

Aye lad said Spitz with a grim smile at my enthusiasm Theres a
sheep in your path Go out and cleave it to the saddle And bring the
saddle home

My sisterinlaw might have thought me cruelbut I did it



CHAP XXIII AND SOME OTHER CHAPS

I know not how it was compassed but that night Rupert of Glasgow was
left bound and gagged against the door of the castle and the
nightbell pulled And that night I was seated on the throne of the
Shelpburgs As I gazed at the Princess Flirtia glowing in the
characteristic beauty of the Shelpburgs and admired her striking
profile I murmured softly and half audibly Her nose is as a tower
that looketh toward Damascus

She looked puzzled and knitted her pretty brows Is that poetry
she asked

No I said promptly Its only part of a song of our great
Ancestor As she blushed slightly I playfully flung around her fair
neck the jeweled collar of the Order of the Shelpburgsthree golden
spheres pendant quartered from the arms of Lombardywith the ancient
Syric motto El Ess Dee

She toyed with it a moment and then said softly You have changed
Rupert Do ye no ken hoo

I looked at heras surprised at her dialect as at the imputation

You dont talk that way as you did And you dont say It WILL be
twelve oclock when you mean It IS twelve oclock nor I will be
going out when you mean I AM And you didnt say Eh sirs or
Eh mon to any of the Courtnor Hoot awa nor any of those
things And she added with a divine little pout you havent told
me I was sonsie or bonnie once

I could with difficulty restrain myself Rage indignation and
jealousy filled my heart almost to bursting I understood it all that
rascally Scotchman had made the most of his time and dared to get
ahead of me I did not mind being taken for the King but to be
confounded with this infernal descendant of a gamekeeperwas too much
Yet with a superhuman effort I remained calmand even smiled

You are not well said the Princess earnestly I thought you were
taking too much of the Strasbourg pie at supper And you are not
going surelyso soon she added as I rose

I must go at once I said I have forgotten some important business
at Bock

Not boar hunting again she said poutingly

No Im hunting a red dear I said with that playful subtlety which
would make her take it as a personal compliment though I was only
thinking of that impostor and longing to get at him as I bowed and
withdrew

In another hour I was before Black Michaels castle at Bock These are
lightning changes I knowand the sovereignty of Trulyruralania WAS
somewhat itinerantbut when a kingdom and a beautiful Princess are at
stake what are you to do Fritz had begged me to take him along but
I arranged that he should come later and go up unostentatiously in the
lift I was going by way of the moat I was to succor the King but I
fear my real object was to get at Rupert of Glasgow

I had noticed the day before that a large outside drain pipe decreed
by the Bock County Council ran from the moat to the third floor of the
donjon keep I surmised that the King was imprisoned on that floor
Examining the pipe closely I saw that it was really a pneumatic
dispatch tube for secretly conveying letters and dispatches from the
castle through the moat beyond the castle walls Its extraordinary
size however gave me the horrible conviction that it was to be used
to convey the dead body of the King to the moat I grew cold with
horrorbut I was determined

I crept up the pipe As I expected it opened funnelwise into a room
where the poor King was playing poker with Black Michael It took me
but a moment to dash through the window into the room push the King
aside gag and bind Black Michael and lower him by a stout rope into
the pipe he had destined for another Having him in my power I
lowered him until I heard his body splash in the water in the lower
part of the pipe Then I proceeded to draw him up again intending to
question him in regard to Rupert of Glasgow But this was difficult as
his saturated clothing made him fit the smooth pipe closely At last I
had him partly up when I was amazed at a rush of water from the pipe
which flooded the room I dropped him and pulled him up again with the
same result Then in a flash I saw it all His body acting like a
piston in the pipe had converted it into a powerful pump Mad with
joy I rapidly lowered and pulled him up again and again until the
castle was floodedand the moat completely drained I had created the
diversion I wished the tenants of the castle were disorganized and
bewildered in trying to escape from the deluge and the moat was
accessible to my friends Placing the poor King on a table to be out
of the water and tying up his head in my handkerchief to disguise him
from Michaels guards I drew my sword and plunged downstairs with the
cataract in search of the miscreant Rupert I reached the drawbridge
when I heard the sounds of tumult and was twice fired atonce as I
have since learned by my friends under the impression that I was the
escaping Rupert of Glasgow and once by Black Michaels myrmidons
under the belief that I was the King I was struck by the fact that
these resemblances were confusing and unfortunate At this moment
however I caught sight of a kilted figure leaping from a lower window
into the moat Some instinct impelled me to follow it It rapidly
crossed the moat and plunged into the forest with me in pursuit I
gained upon it suddenly it turned and I found myself again confronted
with MYSELFand apparently the King But that very resemblance made
me recognize the Scotch pretender Rupert of Glasgow Yet he would
have been called a braw laddie and his handsome face showed a
laughing good humor even while he opposed me claymore in hand

Bide a wee Maister Rupert Razorbill he said lightly lowering his
sword before we slit ane anithers weasands Im no claimin any
descent frae kings and Im no acceptin any auld wifes clavers
against my women forbears as ye are Im just paid gude honest siller
by Black Michael for the using of ma face and figuresic time as his
Majesty is tae worse frae trink And Im commeesioned frae Michael to
ask ye what price YE would take to join me in performing these
dutiesturn and turn aboot Eh laddiebut he would pay ye mair than
that daft beggar Spitz

Rage and disgust overpowered me And THIS is my answer I said
rushing upon him

I have said earlier in these pages that I was a strong swordsman In
point of fact I had carefully studied in the transpontine theatres
that form of melodramatic mediaeval swordplay known as two up and two
down To my disgust however this wretched Scotchman did not seem to
understand it but in a twinkling sent my sword flying over my head
Before I could recover it he had mounted a horse ready saddled in the
wood and shouting to me that he would take my compleements to the
Princess galloped away Even then I would have pursued him afoot but
hearing shouts behind me I turned as Spitz and Fritz rode up

Has the King escaped to Kohlslau asked Fritz staring at me

No I said but Rupert of Glasgow

Rupert of Glasgow growled Spitz Weve settled him Hes gagged
and bound and is now on his way to the frontier in a close carriage

Ruperton his way to the frontier I gasped

Yes Two of my men found him disguised with a handkerchief over his
face trying to escape from the castle And while we were looking for
the King whom we supposed was with you they have sent the rascally
Scotchman home

Fool I gasped Rupert of Glasgow has just left me YOU HAVE
DEPORTED YOUR OWN KING And overcome by my superhuman exertions I
sank unconscious to the ground

When I came to I found myself in a wagon lit speeding beyond the
Trulyruralania frontier On my berth was lying a missive with the seal
of the Shelpburgs Tearing it open I recognized the handwriting of
the Princess Flirtia


MY DEAR RUPERTOwing to the confusion that arises from there being so
many of you I have concluded to accept the hand of the Duke Michael
I may not become a Queen but I shall bring rest to my country and
Michael assures me in his playful manner that three of a kind even
of the same color do not always win at poker It will tranquilize
you somewhat to know that the Lord Chancellor assures me that on
examining the records of the dynasty he finds that my ancestor Rupert
never left his kingdom during his entire reign and that consequently
your ancestress has been grossly maligned I am sending typewritten
copies of this to Rupert of Glasgow and the King Farewell

FLIRTIA


Once a year at Christmastide I receive a simple foreign hamper via
Charing Cross marked Return empty I take it in silence to my own
room and there opening it I findunseen by any other eyes but my
owna modest pate de foie gras of the kind I ate with the Princess
Flirtia I take out the pate replace the label and have the hamper
reconveyed to Charing Cross




THE STOLEN CIGAR CASE

By A CON DLE

I found Hemlock Jones in the old Brook Street lodgings musing before
the fire With the freedom of an old friend I at once threw myself in
my usual familiar attitude at his feet and gently caressed his boot
I was induced to do this for two reasons one that it enabled me to
get a good look at his bent concentrated face and the other that it
seemed to indicate my reverence for his superhuman insight So
absorbed was he even then in tracking some mysterious clue that he
did not seem to notice me But therein I was wrongas I always was in
my attempt to understand that powerful intellect

It is raining he said without lifting his head

You have been out then I said quickly

No But I see that your umbrella is wet and that your overcoat has
drops of water on it

I sat aghast at his penetration After a pause he said carelessly as
if dismissing the subject Besides I hear the rain on the window
Listen

I listened I could scarcely credit my ears but there was the soft
pattering of drops on the panes It was evident there was no deceiving
this man

Have you been busy lately I asked changing the subject What new
problemgiven up by Scotland Yard as inscrutablehas occupied that
gigantic intellect

He drew back his foot slightly and seemed to hesitate ere he returned
it to its original position Then he answered wearily Mere
triflesnothing to speak of The Prince Kupoli has been here to get
my advice regarding the disappearance of certain rubies from the
Kremlin the Rajah of Pootibad after vainly beheading his entire
bodyguard has been obliged to seek my assistance to recover a jeweled
sword The Grand Duchess of PretzelBrauntswig is desirous of
discovering where her husband was on the night of February 14 and last
nighthe lowered his voice slightlya lodger in this very house
meeting me on the stairs wanted to know why they didnt answer his
bell

I could not help smilinguntil I saw a frown gathering on his
inscrutable forehead

Pray remember he said coldly that it was through such an
apparently trivial question that I found out Why Paul Ferroll Killed
His Wife and What Happened to Jones

I became dumb at once He paused for a moment and then suddenly
changing back to his usual pitiless analytical style he said When I
say these are trifles they are so in comparison to an affair that is
now before me A crime has been committedand singularly enough
against myself You start he said You wonder who would have dared
to attempt it So did I nevertheless it has been done I have been
ROBBED

YOU robbed You Hemlock Jones the Terror of Peculators I gasped
in amazement arising and gripping the table as I faced him

Yes Listen I would confess it to no other But YOU who have
followed my career who know my methods you for whom I have partly
lifted the veil that conceals my plans from ordinary humanityyou
who have for years rapturously accepted my confidences passionately
admired my inductions and inferences placed yourself at my beck and
call become my slave groveled at my feet given up your practice
except those few unremunerative and rapidly decreasing patients to
whom in moments of abstraction over MY problems you have administered
strychnine for quinine and arsenic for Epsom salts you who have
sacrificed anything and everybody to meYOU I make my confidant

I arose and embraced him warmly yet he was already so engrossed in
thought that at the same moment he mechanically placed his hand upon
his watch chain as if to consult the time Sit down he said Have
a cigar

I have given up cigar smoking I said

Why he asked

I hesitated and perhaps colored I had really given it up because
with my diminished practice it was too expensive I could afford only
a pipe I prefer a pipe I said laughingly But tell me of this
robbery What have you lost

He arose and planting himself before the fire with his hands under his
coattails looked down upon me reflectively for a moment Do you
remember the cigar case presented to me by the Turkish Ambassador for
discovering the missing favorite of the Grand Vizier in the fifth
chorus girl at the Hilarity Theatre It was that one I mean the cigar
case It was incrusted with diamonds

And the largest one had been supplanted by paste I said

Ah he said with a reflective smile you know that

You told me yourself I remember considering it a proof of your
extraordinary perception But by Jove you dont mean to say you have
lost it

He was silent for a moment No it has been stolen it is true but I
shall still find it And by myself alone In your profession my dear
fellow when a member is seriously ill he does not prescribe for
himself but calls in a brother doctor Therein we differ I shall
take this matter in my own hands

And where could you find better I said enthusiastically I should
say the cigar case is as good as recovered already

I shall remind you of that again he said lightly And now to show
you my confidence in your judgment in spite of my determination to
pursue this alone I am willing to listen to any suggestions from you

He drew a memorandum book from his pocket and with a grave smile took
up his pencil

I could scarcely believe my senses He the great Hemlock Jones
accepting suggestions from a humble individual like myself I kissed
his hand reverently and began in a joyous tone

First I should advertise offering a reward I should give the same
intimation in handbills distributed at the pubs and the
pastrycooks I should next visit the different pawnbrokers I should
give notice at the police station I should examine the servants I
should thoroughly search the house and my own pockets I speak
relatively I added with a laugh Of course I mean YOUR own

He gravely made an entry of these details

Perhaps I added you have already done this

Perhaps he returned enigmatically Now my dear friend he
continued putting the notebook in his pocket and rising would you
excuse me for a few moments Make yourself perfectly at home until I
return there may be some things he added with a sweep of his hand
toward his heterogeneously filled shelves that may interest you and
while away the time There are pipes and tobacco in that corner

Then nodding to me with the same inscrutable face he left the room I
was too well accustomed to his methods to think much of his
unceremonious withdrawal and made no doubt he was off to investigate
some clue which had suddenly occurred to his active intelligence

Left to myself I cast a cursory glance over his shelves There were a
number of small glass jars containing earthy substances labeled
Pavement and Road Sweepings from the principal thoroughfares and
suburbs of London with the subdirections for identifying
foottracks There were several other jars labeled Fluff from
Omnibus and Road Car Seats Cocoanut Fibre and Rope Strands from
Mattings in Public Places Cigarette Stumps and Match Ends from Floor
of Palace Theatre Row A 1 to 50 Everywhere were evidences of this
wonderful mans system and perspicacity

I was thus engaged when I heard the slight creaking of a door and I
looked up as a stranger entered He was a roughlooking man with a
shabby overcoat and a still more disreputable muffler around his throat
and the lower part of his face Considerably annoyed at his intrusion
I turned upon him rather sharply when with a mumbled growling
apology for mistaking the room he shuffled out again and closed the
door I followed him quickly to the landing and saw that he
disappeared down the stairs With my mind full of the robbery the
incident made a singular impression upon me I knew my friends habit
of hasty absences from his room in his moments of deep inspiration it
was only too probable that with his powerful intellect and magnificent
perceptive genius concentrated on one subject he should be careless of
his own belongings and no doubt even forget to take the ordinary
precaution of locking up his drawers I tried one or two and found
that I was right although for some reason I was unable to open one to
its fullest extent The handles were sticky as if some one had opened
them with dirty fingers Knowing Hemlocks fastidious cleanliness I
resolved to inform him of this circumstance but I forgot it alas
untilbut I am anticipating my story

His absence was strangely prolonged I at last seated myself by the
fire and lulled by warmth and the patter of the rain on the window I
fell asleep I may have dreamt for during my sleep I had a vague
semiconsciousness as of hands being softly pressed on my pocketsno
doubt induced by the story of the robbery When I came fully to my
senses I found Hemlock Jones sitting on the other side of the hearth
his deeply concentrated gaze fixed on the fire

I found you so comfortably asleep that I could not bear to awaken
you he said with a smile

I rubbed my eyes And what news I asked How have you succeeded

Better than I expected he said and I think he added tapping his
notebook I owe much to YOU

Deeply gratified I awaited more But in vain I ought to have
remembered that in his moods Hemlock Jones was reticence itself I
told him simply of the strange intrusion but he only laughed

Later when I arose to go he looked at me playfully If you were a
married man he said I would advise you not to go home until you had
brushed your sleeve There are a few short brown sealskin hairs on the
inner side of your forearm just where they would have adhered if your
arm had encircled a sealskin coat with some pressure

For once you are at fault I said triumphantly the hair is my own
as you will perceive I have just had it cut at the hairdressers and
no doubt this arm projected beyond the apron

He frowned slightly yet nevertheless on my turning to go he embraced
me warmlya rare exhibition in that man of ice He even helped me on
with my overcoat and pulled out and smoothed down the flaps of my
pockets He was particular too in fitting my arm in my overcoat
sleeve shaking the sleeve down from the armhole to the cuff with his
deft fingers Come again soon he said clapping me on the back

At any and all times I said enthusiastically I only ask ten
minutes twice a day to eat a crust at my office and four hours sleep
at night and the rest of my time is devoted to you always as you
know

It is indeed he said with his impenetrable smile

Nevertheless I did not find him at home when I next called One
afternoon when nearing my own home I met him in one of his favorite
disguisesa long blue swallowtailed coat striped cotton trousers
large turnover collar blacked face and white hat carrying a
tambourine Of course to others the disguise was perfect although it
was known to myself and I passed himaccording to an old
understanding between uswithout the slightest recognition trusting
to a later explanation At another time as I was making a
professional visit to the wife of a publican at the East End I saw
him in the disguise of a brokendown artisan looking into the window
of an adjacent pawnshop I was delighted to see that he was evidently
following my suggestions and in my joy I ventured to tip him a wink
it was abstractedly returned

Two days later I received a note appointing a meeting at his lodgings
that night That meeting alas was the one memorable occurrence of my
life and the last meeting I ever had with Hemlock Jones I will try
to set it down calmly though my pulses still throb with the
recollection of it

I found him standing before the fire with that look upon his face
which I had seen only once or twice in our acquaintancea look which I
may call an absolute concatenation of inductive and deductive
ratiocinationfrom which all that was human tender or sympathetic
was absolutely discharged He was simply an icy algebraic symbol
Indeed his whole being was concentrated to that extent that his
clothes fitted loosely and his head was absolutely so much reduced in
size by his mental compression that his hat tipped back from his
forehead and literally hung on his massive ears

After I had entered he locked the doors fastened the windows and even
placed a chair before the chimney As I watched these significant
precautions with absorbing interest he suddenly drew a revolver and
presenting it to my temple said in low icy tones

Hand over that cigar case

Even in my bewilderment my reply was truthful spontaneous and
involuntary I havent got it I said

He smiled bitterly and threw down his revolver I expected that
reply Then let me now confront you with something more awful more
deadly more relentless and convincing than that mere lethal
weaponthe damning inductive and deductive proofs of your guilt He
drew from his pocket a roll of paper and a notebook

But surely I gasped you are joking You could not for a moment
believe

Silence Sit down I obeyed

You have condemned yourself he went on pitilessly Condemned
yourself on my processesprocesses familiar to you applauded by you
accepted by you for years We will go back to the time when you first
saw the cigar case Your expressions he said in cold deliberate
tones consulting his paper were How beautiful I wish it were
mine This was your first step in crimeand my first indication
From I WISH it were mine to I WILL have it mine and the mere
detail HOW CAN I make it mine the advance was obvious Silence
But as in my methods it was necessary that there should be an
overwhelming inducement to the crime that unholy admiration of yours
for the mere trinket itself was not enough You are a smoker of
cigars

But I burst out passionately I told you I had given up smoking
cigars

Fool he said coldly that is the SECOND time you have committed
yourself Of course you told me What more natural than for you to
blazon forth that prepared and unsolicited statement to PREVENT
accusation Yet as I said before even that wretched attempt to cover
up your tracks was not enough I still had to find that overwhelming
impelling motive necessary to affect a man like you That motive I
found in the strongest of all impulsesLove I suppose you would call
it he added bitterly that night you called You had brought the
most conclusive proofs of it on your sleeve

But I almost screamed

Silence he thundered I know what you would say You would say
that even if you had embraced some Young Person in a sealskin coat
what had that to do with the robbery Let me tell you then that that
sealskin coat represented the quality and character of your fatal
entanglement You bartered your honor for itthat stolen cigar case
was the purchaser of the sealskin coat

Silence Having thoroughly established your motive I now proceed to
the commission of the crime itself Ordinary people would have begun
with thatwith an attempt to discover the whereabouts of the missing
object These are not MY methods

So overpowering was his penetration that although I knew myself
innocent I licked my lips with avidity to hear the further details of
this lucid exposition of my crime

You committed that theft the night I showed you the cigar case and
after I had carelessly thrown it in that drawer You were sitting in
that chair and I had arisen to take something from that shelf In
that instant you secured your booty without rising Silence Do you
remember when I helped you on with your overcoat the other night I
was particular about fitting your arm in While doing so I measured
your arm with a spring tape measure from the shoulder to the cuff A
later visit to your tailor confirmed that measurement It proved to be
THE EXACT DISTANCE BETWEEN YOUR CHAIR AND THAT DRAWER

I sat stunned

The rest are mere corroborative details You were again tampering
with the drawer when I discovered you doing so Do not start The
stranger that blundered into the room with a muffler onwas myself
More I had placed a little soap on the drawer handles when I purposely
left you alone The soap was on your hand when I shook it at parting
I softly felt your pockets when you were asleep for further
developments I embraced you when you leftthat I might feel if you
had the cigar case or any other articles hidden on your body This
confirmed me in the belief that you had already disposed of it in the
manner and for the purpose I have shown you As I still believed you
capable of remorse and confession I twice allowed you to see I was on
your track once in the garb of an itinerant negro minstrel and the
second time as a workman looking in the window of the pawnshop where
you pledged your booty

But I burst out if you had asked the pawnbroker you would have
seen how unjust

Fool he hissed that was one of YOUR suggestionsto search the
pawnshops Do you suppose I followed any of your suggestions the
suggestions of the thief On the contrary they told me what to avoid

And I suppose I said bitterly you have not even searched your
drawer

No he said calmly

I was for the first time really vexed I went to the nearest drawer
and pulled it out sharply It stuck as it had before leaving a part
of the drawer unopened By working it however I discovered that it
was impeded by some obstacle that had slipped to the upper part of the
drawer and held it firmly fast Inserting my hand I pulled out the
impeding object It was the missing cigar case I turned to him with
a cry of joy

But I was appalled at his expression A look of contempt was now added
to his acute penetrating gaze I have been mistaken he said
slowly I had not allowed for your weakness and cowardice I thought
too highly of you even in your guilt But I see now why you tampered
with that drawer the other night By some inexplicable meanspossibly
another theftyou took the cigar case out of pawn and like a whipped
hound restored it to me in this feeble clumsy fashion You thought
to deceive me Hemlock Jones More you thought to destroy my
infallibility Go I give you your liberty I shall not summon the
three policemen who wait in the adjoining roombut out of my sight
forever

As I stood once more dazed and petrified he took me firmly by the ear
and led me into the hall closing the door behind him This reopened
presently wide enough to permit him to thrust out my hat overcoat
umbrella and overshoes and then closed against me forever

I never saw him again I am bound to say however that thereafter my
business increased I recovered much of my old practice and a few of
my patients recovered also I became rich I had a brougham and a
house in the West End But I often wondered pondering on that
wonderful mans penetration and insight if in some lapse of
consciousness I had not really stolen his cigar case




GOLLY AND THE CHRISTIAN

OR

THE MINX AND THE MANXMAN

By HLL CNE


BOOK I

Golly Coyle was the only granddaughter of a vague and somewhat simple
clergyman who existed with an aunt solely for Gollys epistolary
purposes There was of course intermediate ancestrynotably a dead
mother who was French and therefore responsible for any later
naughtiness in Gollybut they have no purpose here They lived in the
Isle of Man Golly knew a good deal of Man for even at the age of
twelve she was in love with John Galeonly son of Lord Gale who was
connected with the Tempests Gales however were frequent and
remarkable along the coast so that it was not singular that one day
she found John coming on on a headland where she was sitting His
dog had pointed her Its exceedingly impolite to point to anything
you want said Golly Touched by this and overcome by a strange
emotion John Gale turned away and went to Canada Slight as the
incident was it showed that inborn chivalry to women that desire for
the Perfect Life that intense eagerness to incarnate Christianity in
modern society which afterward distinguished him Golly loved him
For all that she still remained a tomboy as she wasrobbing
orchards mimicking tramps and policemen buttering the stairs and the
steps of houses tying kettles to dogs tails and marching in a white
jersey with the curates hat on through the streets of the village
Gol dern my skin said the dear old clergyman as he tried to emerge
from a surplice which Golly had stitched together what spirits the
child DO have Yet everybody loved her And when John Gale returned
from Canada and looked into her big blue eyes one day at church small
wonder that he immediately went off again to Paris and an extended
Continental sojourn with a serious leaning to theology Golly bore
his absence meekly but characteristically got a boat disported like a
duck in the water attempted to elope with a boy appropriately named
Drake but encountered a half gale at sea and a whole Gale in John on a
yacht who rescued them both Convinced now that there was but one way
to escape from his FateGollyJohn Gale took holy orders and at once
started for London As he stood on the deck of the steamer he heard an
imbecile chuckle in his ear It was the simple old clergyman You are
going to London to join the Church John Golly is going there too as
hospital nurse Theres a pair of you He he Look after her John
and protect her Manx simplicity Before John could recover himself
Golly was at his side executing the final steps of a cellardoor flap
jig to the lighthearted refrain

 We are a simple familywe arewe arewe are


And even as her pure young voice arose above the screams of the
departure whistle she threw a double backsomersault on the
quarterdeck cleverly alighting on the spikes of the wheel before the
delighted captain

Jingle my electric bells he said looking at the bright young thing
but youre a regular minx

I beg your pardon interrupted John Gale with a quick flush

I mean a regular MANX said the captain hurriedly

A singular paleness crossed the deeply religious face of John As the
vessel rose on the waves he passed his hand hurriedly first across his
brows and then over his highbuttoned clerical waistcoat that visible
sign of a devoted ascetic life Then murmuring in his low deep voice
Brandy steward he disappeared below


BOOK II

Glorious as were Gollys spirits exquisitely simple her worldly
ignorance and irresistible her powers of mimicry strangely enough
they were considered out of place in St Barabbas Hospital A
lighthearted disposition to mistake a blister for a poultice that
rare Manx conscientiousness which made her give double doses to the
patients as a compensation when she had omitted to give them a single
one and the faculty of bursting into song at the bedside of a dying
patient produced some liveliness not unmixed with perplexity among the
hospital staff It is true however that her performance of
clogdancing during the nightwatches drew a larger and more persistent
attendance of students and young surgeons than ever was seen before
Yet everybody loved her Even her patients If it amooses you miss
to make me tyke the pills wots meant for the lydy in the next ward I
aint complyning said an East End newsboy When ye tyke off the
style of the doctor wot wisits me miss and imitates his wyes Lawd
it does me as much good as his mixtures said a consumptive charwoman
Even thus old and young basked in the radiant youth of Golly She
found time to write to her family


DEAR OLD PALS Im here Jy suis bet your boots While youre
wondering what has become of the Bright Young Thing the B Y T is
lookin out of the winder of St Barabbas Hospitaljust taking in all
of dear roaring dirty London in one gulp Such a placeLordy Ive

Manx people But therethe bell goes aringing for Sarahtheyre

adyin just as youre getting interested in something else Tata

GOLLY


Then her dear old grandfather wrote


Im wondering where my diddleums Golly is We all miss you so much
deary though we dont miss so many little things as when you were
here My dear conscientious unselfish little girl You dont say
where John Gale is Is he still protecting youheheyou giddy
naughty thing People wonder on the island why I let you go alone to
Londonthey forget your dear mother was a Frenchwoman If you see
anything your dear old grandfather would likesend it on

GRANFER


Later her aunt wrote


Have you seen the Queen yet and does she wear her crown at breakfast
You might get over the area railing at Buckingham Palaceit would be
nothing for a girl like you to doand see if you can find out


To these letters Golly answered in her own lighthearted way


DEAR GRANKINSI havent seen John muchbut I think hes like the
Private Secretary at the playhe dont like London Lordy
thereIve let it out Ive been to a theayter Nurse Jinny Jones
and me scrouged into the pit one night without paying pertendin as
we were in uniform we had come to take out a Lydy that had fainted
Such larks and such a glorious theayter Ill tell you another time
Tell aunty the Queens always out when I call But thats nothing
everybody else is so affable and polite in London Gentlemenreal
toffs they call emwhom you dont know from Adamthink nothing of
speaking to you in the street Why Nurse Jinny saysbut there
another patients going off who by rights oughter have died only
tomorrow Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow as that
barnstormer actor said But theyre always calling for that giddy
young thing

Your GOLLY


Meantime John Gale having abruptly left Golly at the door of St
Barabbas hospital tactfully avoiding an unseemly altercation with the
cabdriver regarding her exact fare pursued his way thoughtfully to
the residence of his uncle the First Lord of the Admiralty He found
his Lordship in his bathroom He was leaning over the bathtub which
was half full of water contemplating with some anxiety the model of a
lineofbattle ship which was floating on it bottom upward I dont
think it can be quite rightdo you he said nervously grasping his
nephews hand as he pointed to the capsized vessel yet they always do
it Tell me he went on appealingly tell me as a professing
Christian and a Perfect Manis it quite right

I should think sir responded John Gale with uncompromising
truthfulness that the average vessel of commerce is not built in that
way

Yet said the First Lord of the Admiralty with a faroff look they
all do it And they dont steer The larger they are and the more
recent the model the less they steer Dear meyou ought to see em
go round and round in that tub Then apparently recalling the
probable purpose of Johns visit he led the way into his
dressingroom So you are in London dear boy Is there any little
thing you want I have he continued absently fumbling in the
drawers of his dressingtable a few curacies and a bishopric
somewhere but with these blessed modelsI cant think where they are
Or what would you say to a nice chaplaincy in the navy with a becoming
uniform on one of those thingummies He pointed to the bathroom
Stay he continued as he passed his hand over his perplexed brows
now I think of ityoure quite unorthodox Dear me that wouldnt do
You see Drakehe paused as John Gale startedI mean Sir Francis
Drake once suspended his chaplain for unorthodoxy according to
Froudes book These admirals are dreadfully strict Churchmen No
matter Come again some other time he added gently pushing his
nephew downstairs and into the street and well see about it

With a sinking heart John turned his steps toward Westminster He
would go and see Golly perhaps he had not looked after her as he
ought Suddenly a remembered voice in mimicking accents fell upon
his ear with the quotation Do you know Then in a hansom passing
swiftly by him Golly in hospital dress with flying ribbons appeared
sitting between Lord Brownstone Ewer and Francis Horatio Nelson Drake
completely grown up And from behind floated the inexpressibly sad
refrain Hi tiddli hi

This is how it happened One morning Jinny Jones another hospital
nurse had said to her Have you any objection dear to seeing a
friend of another gent a friend of mine

None in the least dear said Golly I want to see all that can be
seen and do all that can be done in London and know the glory
thereof I only require that I shall be allowed to love John Gale
whenever he permits it which isnt often and that I may be permitted
to write simple letters to my doting relations at the rate of twelve
pages a day giving an accountMY OWN accountof my doings There
Go on now Bring on your bears

They had visited the chambers which Lord Brownstone and Drake occupied
together and in girlish innocence had put on the gentlemens clothes
and danced before them Then they all went to the theatre where
Gollys delightful simplicity and childish ignorance of the world had
charmed them Everything to her was new strange and thrilling She
even leaned from the carriage windows to see the wheels go round
She was surprised at the number of people in the theatre and insisted
on knowing if it was church because they all sat there in their best
clothes so quietly She believed that the play was real and
frequently from a stage box interrupted the acting with explanations
She informed the heroine of the design of the villain waiting at the
wings And when the aged mother of the heroine was dying of starvation
in a hovel and she threw a bag of bonbons on the stage with the
vociferous declaration that Lord Brownstone had just given them to
herbutLordySHE didnt want them they were obliged to lead her
away closely followed by an usher and a policeman To think she
wrote to John Gale that the audience only laughed and shouted and
never offered to help And yet look at the churches in London where
they dare to preach the gospel

Fired by this simple letter and alarmed by Gollys simplicity John
Gale went to his clerical chief Archdeacon Luxury and demanded
permission to preach next Sunday Certainly said the Archdeacon
you shall take my curates place I shall inform the congregation
that you are the son of Lord Gale They are very particular
churchmenall society peopleand of course will be satisfied with the
work of the Lord especially he added with a polite smile when
that work happens to bethe Lord Gales son Accordingly the next
Sunday John Gale occupied the pulpit of St Swithin But an
unexpected event happened His pentup eagerness to denounce the
present methods of Christianity his fullness of utterance defeated
his purpose He was overcome with a kind of pulpit fright His ideas
of time and place fled him After beginning Mr Chairman in rising
to propose the toast of our worthy ArchdeaconFellow Manxmenthe
present momentererthe proudest in myerlifeDearly beloved
Gollyunaccustomed as I am to public speaking he abruptly delivered
the benediction and sat down The incident however provoked little
attention The congregation accustomed to sleep through the sermon
awoke at the usual time and went home Only a single Scotchwoman said
to him in passing Verra weel for a beginning laddie But give it
hotter to em next time Discomfited and bewildered he communed with
himself gloomily I cant marry Golly I cant talk I hate
society Whats to be done I have it Ill go into a monastery

He went into a monastery in Bishopsgate Street reached by a threepenny
bus He gave out vaguely that he had got into Something Good in the
City Society was satisfied Only Golly suspected the truth She
wrote to her grandfather


I saw John Gale the other day with a crowd following him in the
Strand He had on only a kind of brown serge dressinggown tied
around his waist by a rope and a hood on his head I think his poor
toetoes were in sandals and I dare say his legs were cold poor
dear However if he calls THAT protection of GollyI dont I might
be run off at any momentfor all hed help No matter If this Court
understands herself and she thinks she do Golly can take care of
herselfyou bet


Nevertheless Golly lost her place at the hospital through her heroic
defense of her friend Jinny Jones who had been deceived by Lord
Brownstone Ewer You would drive that poor girl into the street she
said furiously to the Chairman of the Board throwing her cap and apron
in their faces Youre a lot of rotten old hypocrites and Im glad
to get shut of you Not content with that she went to Drake and
demanded that he should make his friend Lord Brownstone marry Jinny

Sorryawfully sorrymy dear Golly but hes engaged to a rich
American girl who is to pay his debts but Ill see that he does
something handsome for Jinny And YOU my child what are YOU going to
do without a situation he added with touching sympathy You see
Ive some vague idea of marrying you myself he concluded meditatively

Thank you for nothing interrupted Golly gayly but I can take care
of myself and follow out my mission like John Gale

Theres a pair of you certainly said Drake with a tinge of jealous
bitterness

You bet its a pair that will take your two knaves you and your
Lord Brownstone returned Golly dropping a mock courtesy Tata Im
going on the stage


BOOK III

She went first into a tobacconistsand sold cigarettes Sometimes she
suffered from actual want and ate fried fish Do you know how nice
fried fish tastes in Londonyou on the Oilan she wrote gayly
Im getting on splendidly sos John Gale I suppose though hes
looking cadaverous from starving himself all round Tell aunty I
havent seen the Queen yet though after all I really believe she has
not seen me

Then after a severe struggle she succeeded in getting on the stage as
a song and dance girl She sang melodiously and danced divinely so
remarkably that the ignorant public knowing her to be a Manx girl and
vaguely associating her with the symbol of the Isle of Man supposed
she had three legs She was the success of the season her cup of
ambition was filled It was slightly embittered by the news that her
friend Jinny Jones had killed herself in the church at the wedding of
her recreant lover and the American heiress But the affair was
scarcely alluded to by the Society paperswho were naturally shocked
at the bad taste of the deceased And even Golly forgot it allon the
stage


BOOK IV

Meanwhile John Gale or Brother Boreas as he was known in the
monastery was submittingamong other rigorsto an exceptionally
severe winter in Bishopsgate Street which seemed to have an Arctic
climate of its ownpossibly induced by the freezingout process of
certain stock companies in its vicinity

You are miserable and eager to get out in the wicked world again my
son said the delightful old Superior as he sat by the only fire
sipping a glass of mulled port when John came in from shoveling snow
outside I therefore merely to try you shall make you gatekeeper
The keys of the monastery front door are under the doormat in my cell
but I am a sound sleeper He smiled seraphically and winked casually
as he sipped his port We will call it if you pleasea penance

John threw himself in an agony of remorse and shame at the feet of the
Superior It isnt of myself Im thinking he confessed wildly but
of that poor young man Brother Bones in the next cell to mine He is
a living skeleton has got only one lung and an atrophied brain A
night out might do him good

The Father Superior frowned Do you know who he is

No

His real name is Jones Why do you start You have heard it before

John had started thinking of Jinny Jones Gollys deserted and
selfimmolated friend

It is an uncommon name he stammeredfor a monastery I mean

He is or was an uncommon man said the Superior gravely But he
added resignedly we cannot pick and choose our company here Most of
us have done something and have our own reasons for this retreat
Brother Polygamus escaped here from the persecutions of his sixth wife
Even I continued the Superior with a gentle smile putting his feet
comfortably on the mantelpiece have had my little fling and the dear
boys used to sayahembut this is mere worldly vanity You alone
my dear son he went on with slight severity seem to be wanting in
some criminality orshall I saysome appropriate besetting sin to
qualify you for this holy retreat An absolutely gratuitous and
blameless idiocy appears to be your only peculiarity and for this you
must do penance From this day henceforth I make you doorkeeper Go
on with your shoveling at present and shut the door behind you
theres a terrible draught in these corridors

For three days John Gale underwent an agony of doubt and determination
and it still snowed in Bishopsgate Street

On the fourth evening he went to Brother Bones

Would you like to have an evening out

I would said Brother Bones

What would you do

I would go to see my remaining sister His left eyelid trembled
slowly in his cadaverous face

But if you should hear she was ruined like the other What would you
do

A shudder passed over the man I have not got my little knife he
said vacantly

True he had not The Brotherhood had no pocketsor rather only a
corporate one which belonged to the Superior John Gale lifted his
eyes in sublime exaltation You shall go out he said with decision
Muffle up until you are well out of Bishopsgate Street where it still
snows

But how did you get the keys said Brother Bones

From under the Father Superiors doormat

But that was wrong Brother

The mat bore the inscription Salve which you know in Latin means
Welcome returned John Gale It was logically a permission

The two men gazed at each other silently A shudder passed over the
two left eyelids of their wan spiritual faces

But I have no money said Brother Bones

Nor have I But here is a bus ticket and a free pass to the Gaiety
You will probably find Golly somewhere about Tell her he said in a
hollow voice that Im getting on

I will said Brother Bones with a deep cough

The gate opened and he disappeared in the falling snow The bloodhound
kept by the monasteryone of the real Bishopsgate breedbayed twice
and licked its huge jaws in ghastly anticipation I wonder said
John Gale as he resumed his shoveling if I have done exactly right
Candor compels me to admit that it is an open question


BOOK V

Early the next morning Brother Bones was brought home by Policeman X
his hat crushed his face haggard his voice husky and unintelligible
He only said vaguely Washertime

It is said John Gale timidly in explanation to Policeman X a case
of spiritual exhaustion following a vigil

That warnt her name said Policeman X sternly But dont let this
ere appen again

John Gale turned to Brother Bones Then you saw herGolly

No said Brother Bones

Why What on earth have you been doing

Dunno Found myself in stashunzis morning Thashall

Then John Gale sought the Superior in an agony of remorse and
confessed all I am unfit to remain doorkeeper Remove me he
groaned bitterly

The old man smiled gently On the contrary I should have given you
the keys myself Hereafter you can keep them The ways of our
Brotherhood are mysteriousindeed you may think idioticbut we are
not responsible for them Its all Brother Caines doingits All
Caine


BOOK VI

Nevertheless John Gale left the monastery The Bishopsgate Street
winter does not suit me he briefly explained to the Superior I
must go south or southwest

But he did neither He saw Golly who was living west He upbraided
her for going on the stage She retorted Whose life is the more
artificial yours or mine It is true that we are both imperfectly
clothed she added glancing at a photograph of herself in a short
skirt and not always in our right mindbut youve caught nothing but
a cold Nevertheless I love you and you love me

Then he begged her to go with him to the South Seas and take the place
of Father Damien among the colony of lepers It is a beautiful place
and inexpensive for we shall live only a few weeks What do you say
dearest You know he added with a faint sad smile glancing at
another photograph of herexecuting the high kickyoure quite a
leaper yourself

But that night she received an offer of a new engagement She wrote to
John Gale The South Seas is rather an expensive trip to take simply
to die Couldnt we do it as cheaply at home Or couldnt you prevail
on your Father Superior to set up his monastery there Im afraid Im
not up to it Why dont you try the old Oilan nearer home Theres
lots of measles and diphtheria about there lately

When the heartbroken John Gale received this epistle he also received
a letter from his uncle the First Lord of the Admiralty I dont
fancy this Damien whim of yours If youre really in earnest about
killing yourself why not take a brief trial trip in one of our latest
ironclads Its just as risky althoughas we are obliged to keep
these things quiet in the Officeyou will not of course get that
publicity your noble soul craves

Abandoned by all in his noble purposes John Gale took the first
steamer to the Isle of Man


BOOK VII

But he did not remain there long Once back in that epistolary island
he wrote interminable letters to Golly When they began to bore each
other he returned to London and entered the Salvation Army Crowds
flocked to hear him preach He inveighed against Society and
Wickedness as represented in his mind by Golly and her friends and
praised a perfect Christianity represented by himself and HIS friends
A panic of the same remarkable character as the Bishopsgate Street
winter took possession of London Old Moores Zadkiels and Mother
Shiptons prophecies were to be fulfilled at an early and fixed date
with no postponement on account of weather Suddenly Society John
Drake and Antichrist generally combined by ousting him from his
church and turning it into a musichall for Golly Then John Gale
took his last and sublime resolve His duty as a perfect Christian was
to kill Golly His logic was at once inscrutable perfect andJohn
Galish

With this sublime and lofty purpose he called upon Golly The heroic
girl saw his purpose in his eyean eye at once black murderous and
Christianlike For an instant she thought it was better to succumb at
once and thus end this remarkable attachment Suddenly through this
chaos of Spiritual Religious Ecstatic SuperEgotistic whirl of
confused thought darted a gleam of Common Ordinary Horse Sense John
Gale saw it illumine her blue eyes and trembled God in Mercy If it
came to THAT

Sit down John she said calmly Then in her sweet clear voice
she said Did it ever occur to you dearest that a more ridiculous
unconvincing purposeless insane Godforsaken idiot than you never
existed That you eclipse the wildest dreams of insanity That you
are a mental and moral Whatisit

It has occurred to me he replied simply I began life with vast
asinine possibilities which fall to the lot of few men yet I cannot
say that I have carried even THEM to a logical conclusion But YOU
love YOU darling conceived in extravagance born to impossibility a
challenge to credulity a problem to the intellect a missing word
for all agesare you aware of any one as utterly unsympathetic
unreal and untrue to nature as you are existing on the face of the
earth or in the waters under the earth

You are right dearest there are none she returned with the same
calm level voice It is true that I have at times tried to do
something real and womanly and not you know merely to complicate
aaher voice falteredtheatrical situationbut I couldnt
Something impelled me otherwise Now you know why I became an actress
But even there I fail THEY are allowed reasoning power off the
stageI have none at any time I laugh in the wrong placeI do the
unnecessary extravagant thing Endowed by some strange power with
extraordinary attributes I am supposed to make everybody love me but
I dontI satisfy nobody I convince none I have no idea what will
happen to me next I am doomed toI know not what

And I he groaned bitterly I in some rare and lucid moments have
had a glimpse of this too We are in the hands of some inscrutable but
awful power Tell me Golly tell me darling who is it

Again that gleam of Common or Ordinary Horse Sense came in her eye

I have found out who she whispered I have found out who has
created us and made us as puppets in his hands

Is it the Almighty he asked

No it isshe said with a burst of real laughterit isThe All
Caine

What our countryman the Manxman The only great Novelist The
beloved of Gladstone he gasped

Yesand he intends to kill YOUand were only to be married at your
deathbed

PUBLISHERS NOTEIn that supreme work of my life The Christian
said the gifted novelist to a reporter in speaking of his methods I
had endowed the characters of Golly and John Gale with such superhuman
vitality and absolute reality thatas is well known in the experience
of great writersthey became thinking beings and actually criticised
my work and even INTERFERED and REBELLED to the point of altering my
climax and the end The present edition gives that ending which of
course is the only real one



THE ADVENTURES OF JOHN LONGBOWE YEOMAN

BEING A MODERNANTIQUE REALISTIC ROMANCE

COMPILED FROM SEVERAL EMINENT SOURCES

It seemeth but fair that I John Longbowe should set down this account
of such hap and adventure as hath befallen me without flourish
vaporing or cozening of speech but as becometh one who not being a
ready writer goeth straight to the matter in hand in few words So
though I offend some I shall yet convince all the which lieth closer
to my purpose Thus it was in the year 1560 or 1650 or mayhap
1710for my memory is not what it hath been and I ever cared little
for monkish calendars or such dryasdust matter being active as
becometh one who hath to make his way in the worldyet I wot well it
was after the Great Plague which I have great cause to remember lying
at my cozens in Wardour Street London in that lamentable year
eating of gilly flowers sulphur hartes tongue and many stynking
herbes touching neither man nor mayd save with a great tongs steept
in pitch wearing a fine maske of silk with a mouth piece of aromatic
stuffby reason of which acts of hardihood and courage I was
miraculously preserved This much I shall say as to the time of these
happenings and no more I am a plain blunt manmayhap rude of
speech should occasion warrantso let them who require the exactness
of a scrivener or a pedagogue go elsewhere for their entertainment and
be hanged to them

Howbeit though no scholar I am not one of those who misuse the
English speech and being foolishly led by the hasty custom of
scriveners and printers to write the letters T and H joined
together which resembleth a Y do incontinently jump to the
conclusion the THE is pronounced Yethe like of which I never heard
in all England And though this be little toward those great
enterprises and happenings I shall presently shew I set it down for
the behoof of such malapert wights as must needs gird at a man of
spirit and actionand yet in sooth know not their own letters

So to my tale There was a great frost when my Lord bade me follow him
to the water gate near our lodgings in the Strand When we reached it
we were amazed to see that the Thames was frozen over and many citizens
disporting themselves on the icethe like of which no man had seen
before There were fires built thereon and many ships and barges were
stuck hard and fast and my Lord thought it vastly pretty that the
people were walking under their bows and cabbin windows and climbing of
their sides like mermen but I being a plain blunt man had no joy in
such idlenesse deeming it better that in these times of pith and
enterprise they should be more seemly employed My Lord because of
one or two misadventures by reason of the slipperiness of the ice was
fain to go by London Bridge which we did my Lord as suited his humor
ruffling the staid citizens as he passed or peering under the hoods of
their wives and daughtersas became a young gallant of the time I
being a plain blunt man assisted in no such folly but contented
myself when they complayned to me with damning their souls for greasy
interfering varlets For I shall now make no scruple in declaring that
my Lord was the most noble Earl of Southampton being withheld from so
saying before through very plainness and bluntness desiring as a
simple yeoman to make no boast of serving a man of so high quality

We fared on over Bankside to the Globe playhouse where my Lord bade me
dismount and deliver a secret message to the chief playerwhich
message was had he diligently perused and examined that he wot of
and what said he thereof Which I did Thereupon he that was called
the chief player did incontinently proceed to load mine arms and wallet
with many and divers rolls of manuscripts in my Lords own hand and
bade me say unto him that there was a great frost over London but that
if he were to perform those plays and masques publickly there would be
a greater frost thereto wit in the Globe playhouse This I did
deliver with the Manuscripts to my Lord who changed countenance
mightily at the sight of them but could make nought of the message
At which the lad who held the horses before the playhouseone Will
Shakespearesplit with laughter Whereat my Lord cursed him for a
deerstealing coneycatching Warwickshire lout and cuffed him
soundly I wot there will be those who remember that this Will
Shakespeare afterwards became a player and did write playswhich were
acceptable even to the Queens Majestys selfand I set this down not
from vanity to shew I have held converse with such nor to give a
seemingness and colour to my story but to shew what illjudged
misinformed knaves were they who did afterwards attribute friendship
between my Lord and this Will Shakespeare even to the saying that he
made sonnets to my Lord Howbeit my Lord was exceeding wroth and I
to beguile him did propose that we should leave our horses and cargoes
of manuscript behind and cross on the ice afoot which conceit pleased
him mightily In sooth it chanced well with what followed for hardly
were we on the river when we saw a great crowd coming from Westminster
before a caravan of strange animals and savages in masks capering and
capricolling dragging after them divers sledges quaintly fashioned
like swannes in which were ladies attired as fairies and goddesses and
such like heathen and wanton trumpery which I as a plain blunt man
would have fallen to cursing had not my Lord himself damned me under
his breath to hold my peace for that he had recognized my Lord of
Leicesters colours and that he made no doubt they were of the Court
As forsooth this did presently appear also that one of the ladies was
her Gracious Majestys selfmasked to the general eye the better to
enjoy these miscalled festivities I say miscalled for though a
loyal subject of her Majesty and one who hath borne arms at Tilbury
Fort in defence of her Majesty it inflamed my choler as a plain and
blunt man that her Mightiness should so degrade her dignity Howbeit
as a man who hath his way to make in the world I kept mine eyes well
upon the anticks of the Great while my Lord joined the group of
maskers and their follies I recognized her Majestys presence by her
discourse in three languages to as many Ambassadors that were
presentthough I marked well that she had not forgotten her own
tongue calling one of her ladies a sluttish wench nor her English
spirit in cuffing my Lord of Essexs ears for some indecorumwhich as
a plain man myself curt in speech and action did rejoice me greatly
But I must relate one feat the like of which I never saw in England
before or since There was a dance of the maskers and in the midst of
it her Majesty asked the Ambassador from Spayne if he had seen the
latest French dance He replied that he had not Whereupon Her Most
Excellent Majesty skipt back a pace and forward a pace and lifting her
hoop delivered a kick at his Excellencys hat which sent it flying the
space of a good English ell above his head Howbeit so great was the
acclamation that her Majesty was graciously moved to repeat it to my
Lord of Leicester but tripping back her high heels caught in her
farthingale and she would have fallen on the ice but for that my
Lord with exceeding swiftness and dexterity whisked his cloak from
his shoulder spreading it under her and so received her body in its
folds on the ice without himself touching her Majestys person Her
Majesty was greatly pleased at this and bade my Lord buy another cloak
at her cost though it swallowed an estate but my Lord replyed after
the lying fashion of the time that it was honour enough for him to be
permitted to keep it after it had received her Royal person I know
that this hap hath been partly related of another personthe shipman
Raleighbut I tell such as deny me that they lie in their teeth for
I John Longbowe have causemiserable cause enough I warrantto
remember it and my Lord can bear me out For spite of his fair
speeches when he was quit of the Royal presence he threw me his wet
and bedraggled cloak and bade me change it with him for mine own which
was dry and warm And it was this simple act which wrought the
lamentable and cruel deed of which I was the victim for as I followed
my Lord thus apparelled across the ice I was suddenly set upon and
seized a chokepear clapt into my mouth so that I could not cry aloud
mine eyes bandaged mine elbows pinioned at my side in that fatall
cloak like to a trussed fowl and so I was carried to where the ice was
broken and thrust into a boat Thence I was conveyed in the same rude
sort to a ship dragged up her smooth wet side and clapt under
hatches Here I lay helpless as in a swoon When I came to it was
with a great trampling on the decks above and the washing of waves
below and I made that the ship was movingbut where I knew not
After a little space the hatch was lifted from where I lay the
chokepear taken from my mouth but not the bandage from mine eyes so
I could see nought around me But I heard a strange voice say What
coil is this This is my Lords cloak in sooth but not my Lord that
lieth in it Who is this fellow At which I did naturally discover
the great misprise of those varlets who had taken me for my dear Lord
whom I now damned in my heart for changing of the cloaks Howbeit
when I had fetched my breath with difficulty being well nigh spent by
reason of the gag I replyed that I was John Longbowe my Lords true
yeoman as good a man as any as they should presently discover when
they set me ashore That I knew Softly friend said the Voice
thou knowest too much for the good of England and too little for thine
own needs Thou shalt be sent where thou mayest forget the one and
improve thy knowledge of the other Then as if turning to those about
him for I could not see by reason of the blindfold he next said
Take him on your voyage and see that he escape not till ye are quit
of England And with that they clapt to the hatch again and I heard
him cast off from the ships side There was I John Longbowe an
English yeomanI who but that day had held converse with Will
Shakespeare and been cognizant of the revels of Her Most Christian
Majesty even to the spying of her garterI was kidnapped at the age
of fortyfive or thereaboutfor I will not be certain of the yearand
forced to sea for that my Lord of Southampton had provoked the
jealousie and envy of divers other great nobles



CHAPTERS I TO XX

I AM FORCED TO SEA AND TO BECOME A PIRATE I SUFFER LAMENTABLY FROM
SICKNESS BY REASON OF THE BIGNESSE OF THE WAVES I COMMIT MANY
CRUELTIES AND BLOODSHED BUT BY THE DIVINE INTERCESSION I EVENTUALLY
THROW THE WICKED CAPTAIN OVERBOARD AND AM ELECTED IN HIS STEAD I
DISCOVER AN ISLAND OF TREASURE OBTAIN POSSESSION THEREOF BY A TRICKE
AND PUT THE NATIVES TO THE SWORD

I marvel much at those who deem it necessary in the setting down of
their adventures to gloze over the whiles between with much matter of
the country the peoples and even their own foolish reflections
thereon hoping in this way to cozen the reader with a belief in their
own truthfulness and encrease the extravagance of their deeds I
being a plain blunt man shall simply say for myself that for many
days after being taken from the bilboes and made free of the deck I
was grievously distempered by reason of the waves and so collapsed in
the bowels that I could neither eat stand nor lie Being thus in
great fear of death from which I was miraculously preserved I out of
sheer gratitude to my Maker did incontinently make oath and sign
articles to be one of the crewwhich were buccaneers I did this the
more readily as we were to attack the ships of Spayne only and through
there being no state of Warre at that time between England and that
country it was wisely conceived that this conduct would provoke it
and we should thus be forearmed as became a juste man in his quarrel
For this we had the precious example of many great Captains We did
therefore heave to and burn many shipsthe quality of those
engagements I do not set forth not having a seamans use of ship
speech and despising as a plain blunt man those who misuse it
having it not

But this I do know that having some conceit of a shipmans ways and
of pirates I did conceive at this time a pretty song for my comradoes
whereof the words ran thus

 Yo ho when the Dog Watch bayeth loud
 In the light of a midsea moon
 And the Dead Eyes glare in the stiffening Shroud
 For that is the Pirates noon
 When the Night Mayres sit on the Dead Mans Chest
 Where no mannes breath may come
 Then hey for a bottle of Rum Rum Rum
 And a passage to Kingdom come


I take no credit to myself for the same except so far as it may shew a
touch of my Lord of Southamptons mannerwe being intimatebut this I
know that it was much acclaimed by the crew Indeed they observing
that the Captain was of a cruel nature would fain kill him and put me
in his stead but I objecting to the shedding of precious blood in
such behoof did prevent such a lamentable and inhuman action by
stealthily throwing him by night from his cabbin window into the
seawhere owing to the inconceivable distance of the ship from shore
he was presently drowned Which untoward fate had a great effect upon
my fortunes since burthening myself with his goods and effects I
found in his chest a printed proclamation from an aged and infirm
clergyman in the West of England covenanting that for the sum of two
crowns he would send to whoso offered the chart of an island of great
treasure in the Spanish Main whereof he had had confession from the
lips of a dying parishioner and the amount gained thereby he would use
for the restoration of his parish church Now I reading this was
struck by a great remorse and admiration for our late Captain for that
it would seem that he was like myself a staunch upholder of the
Protestant Faith and the Church thereof as did appear by his
possession of the chart for which he had no doubt paid the two good
crowns As an act of penance I resolved upon finding the same island
by the aid of the chart and to that purpose sailed East many days and
South and North and West as many other daysthe manner whereof and
the latitude and longitude of which I shall not burden the reader with
holding it as a plain blunt man mere padding and impertinence to
fill out my narrative which helpeth not the general reader So I
say when we sighted the Island which seemed to be swarming with
savages I ordered the masts to be stripped save but for a single sail
which hung sadly and distractedly and otherwise put the ship into the
likeness of a forlorn wreck clapping the men save one or two under
hatches This I did to prevent the shedding of precious blood knowing
full well that the ignorant savages believing the ship in sore
distress would swim off to her with provisions and fruit bearing no
arms Which they did while we as fast as they clomb the sides
despatched them at leisure without unseemly outcry or alarms Having
thus disposed of the most adventurous we landed and took possession of
the island finding thereon many kegs of carbuncles and rubies and
pieces of eightthe treasure store of those lawless pirates who infest
the seas having no colour of war or teaching of civilisation to atone
for their horrid deeds

I discovered also by an omission in the chart that this was not the
Island wot of by the good and aged Devonshire divineand so we eased
our consciences of accounting for the treasure to him We then sailed
away arriving after many years absence at the Port of Bristol in
Merrie England where I took leave of the Jolly Roger that being the
name of my ship it was a strange conceit of seamen in after years ever
to call the device of my FLAGto wit a skull and bones made in the
sign of a Crossby the NAME my ship bore and if I have only corrected
the misuse of history by lying knaves I shall be content with this
writing But alas such are the uncertainties of time I found my good
Lord of Southampton dead and most of his friends beheaded and the
blessed King James of Scotlandif I mistake not for these also be the
uncertainties of timeon the throne In due time I married Mistress
Marian Straitways I might have told more of trifling and how she
fared poor wench in mine absence even to the following of me in
another ship in a shipboys disguise and how I rescued her from a
scheming Pagan villain but as a plain blunt man I am no hand at the
weaving of puling love tales and such trifling diversions for lovesick
mayds and their puny gallantshaving only consideration for men and
their deeds which I have here set down bluntly and even at mine
advanced years am ready to maintain with the hand that set it down



DANL BOREM

BY E NS WTT


I

Danl Borem poured half of his second cup of tea abstractedly into his
lap

Guess youve got suthin on yer mind Danl said his sister

Morn likely Ive got suthin on my pants returned Danl with that
exquisitely dry though somewhat protracted humor which at once
thrilled and bored his acquaintances Butspeakin o that hoss
trade

For goodness sake dont interrupted his sister wearily yer allus
doin it Jest tell me about that young manthe new clerk ye think o
gettin

Well I telegraphed him to come over arter I got this letter from
him he returned handing her a letter Read it out loud

But his sister having an experienced horror of prolixity glanced over
it Far as I kin see he takes morn two hundred words to say youve
got to take him on trust and sez it suthin in a style betwixt a
business circular and them Polite Letter Writers I thought you
allowed he was a tony feller

Ef he does not brag much ye see I kin offer him small wages said
Danl with a wink Its kinder takin him at his own figger

And THAT mightnt pay But ye dont think o bringin him HERE in
this house Cept youre thinkin o tellin him that yarn o yours
about the hoss trade to beguile the winter evenings I told ye yed
hev to pay yet to get folks to listen to it

Wrong aginez youll see Wot ef I get a hundred thousand folks to
pay me for tellin it But speakin o this young feller I
calkilated to send him to the Turkey Buzzard Hotel and he looked at
his sister with a shrewd yet humorous smile

What said his sister in alarm The Turkey Buzzard Why hell be
starved or pizoned He wont stay there a week

Ef hes pizoned to death he wont be able to demand any wages ef he
leaves because he cant stand itits proof positive he couldnt stand
me Ef hes only starved and made weak and miserable hell be easy to
make terms with It may seem hard what Im sayin but what seems hard
on the other feller always comes mighty easy to you The thing is NOT
to be the other feller Ye aint listenin Yet these remarks is
shrewd and humorous and hez bin thought so by literary fellers

Hm said his sister Whats that ye was jest sayin about folks
bein willin to pay ye for tellin that hoss trade yarn o yours

Thets only what one o them smart New York publishers allowed it was
worth arter hearin me tell it said Danl dryly

Go way You or him must be crazy Why it aint ez good as that
story bout a man who had a balky hoss that could be made to go only by
buildin a fire under him and arter the man sells that hoss and the
secret and the man wot bought him tries it on the blamed hoss lies
down over the fire and puts it out

Ive allus allowed that the story ye hev to tell yourself is a blamed
sight funnier than the one yere listenin to said Danl Put that
down among my sayins will ye

But your story was never anythin more than one o them snippy things
ye see in the papers drored out to no end by you Its only one o
them funny paragraphs ye kin read in a minit in the papers that takes
YOU an hour to tell

To her surprise Danl only looked at his sister with complacency

That he said is jest what the New York publisher sez The
Merrikan people sez he is ashamed o bein short and peart and
funny it lacks dignity sez he it looks funny sez he but it
aint deepseated nashnul literature sez he Them snips o funny
stories and short dialogues in the comic papersthey make ye laff
sez he but laffin isnt no sign o deep morril purpose sez he
and it aint genteel and refined Abraham Linkin with his pat
anecdotes ruined our standin with dignified nashuns sez he We
cultivated publishers is sick o hearin furrin nashuns roarin over
funny Merrikan stories were goin to show em that even ef we
havent classes and titles and sich we kin be dull Were workin the
historical racket for all that its worthef we cant go back morn a
hundred years or so we kin rake in a Lord and a Lady when we do and
were gettin in some olefashioned spellin and methinkses and
peradventures Were doin the religious bizness ez slick ez Robert
Elsmere and we find lots o soul in folksand heaps o quaint morril
characters sez he

Sakes alive Danl broke in his sister whats all that got to do
with your yarn bout the hoss trade

Everythin returned Danl For sez he Mr Borem sez he
youre a quaint morril character Youve got protracted humor sez
he Youve bin an hour tellin that yarn o yours Ef ye could spin
it out to fill two chapters of a bookyer fortunes made For youll
show that a successful hoss trade involves the highest nashnul
characteristics That what common folk calls selfishness revenge
mean lyin and lowdown moneygrubbin ambishun is really
quaintness and will go in double harness with the bizness of a
Christian banker sez he

Created goodness Danl Youre designin ter

Danl Borem rose coughed expectorated carefully at the usual spot in
the fender his general custom of indicating the conclusion of a
subject or an interview and said dryly Im thar


II

To return to the writer of the letter whose career was momentarily cut
off by the episode of the horse trade who if he had previously
received a letter written by somebody else would have been an entirely
different person and not in this novel at all John Lummoxknown to
his family as the perfect Lummoxhad been two years in college but
thought it rather fine of himselfa habit of thought in which he
frequently indulgedto become a clerk but finally got tired of it
and to his fathers relief went to Europe for a couple of years
returning with some knowledge of French and German and the cutting end
of a German students blunted dueling sword Having as he felt thus
equipped himself for the hero of an American Good Society novel he
went on board a liner where there would naturally be susceptible
young ladies One he thought he recognized as a girl with whom he used
to play forfeits in the vulgar past of his boyhood She sat at his
table accompanied by another lady whose husband seemed to be a
confirmed dyspeptic His remarks struck Lummox as peculiar

Shall I begin dinner with pudding and cheese or take the ordinary soup
first I quite forget which I did last night he said anxiously to
his wife

But Mrs Starling hesitated

Tell me Mary he said appealing to Miss Bike the young lady

I should begin with the pudding said Miss Bike decisively and
between that and the arrival of the cheese you can make up your mind
and then if you think better go back to the soup

Thank you so much Now as to drink Shall I take the
Friedrichshalle first or the Benedictine You know the doctor insists
upon the Friedrichshalle but I dont think I did well to mix them as I
did yesterday Or shall I take simply milk and beer

I should say simplicity was best Besides you can always fill up
with champagne later

How splendidly this clearheaded cleareyed girl dominated the man
Lummox felt that REALLY he might renew her acquaintance He did so

I remembered you she said Youve not changed a bit since you were
eight years old

John wishing to change the subject said that he thought Mr Starling
seemed an uncertain man

Very Hes even now in his stateroom sitting in his pyjamas with a
rubber shoe on one foot and a pump on the other wondering whether he
ought to put on golf knickerbockers with a dressinggown and straw hat
before he comes on deck He has already put on and taken off about
twenty suits

He certainly is very trying returned Lummox He paused and colored
deeply I beg he stammered I hopeyou dont think me guilty of a
pun When I said trying I referred entirely to the effect on your
sensitiveness of these tentative attempts toward clothing himself

I should never accuse YOU of levity Mr Lummox said the young lady
gazing thoughtfully upon his calm but somewhat heavy featuresnever

Yet he would have liked to reclaim himself by a show of lightness He
was leaning on the rail looking at the sea The scene was beautiful

I suppose he said rolling with the sea and his early studies of
Doctor Johnson that one would in the more superior manner show his
appreciation of all this by refraining from the obvious comment which
must needs be recognized as comparatively commonplace and vulgar but
really this is so superb that I must express some of my emotion even
at the risk of lowering your opinion of my good taste provided of
course that you have any opinion on the one hand or any good taste on
the other

Without that undue depreciation of ones self which must ever be a
sign of selfconscious demerit said the young girl lightly I may
say that I am not generally good at Johnsonese but it may relieve your
mind to know that had you kept silence one instant longer I should
have taken the risk of lowering your opinion of my taste provided of
course that you have one to lower and are capable of that exertionif
such indeed it may be termedby remarking that this is perfectly
magnificent

Do you think he said gloomily still leaning on the rail that we
can keep this kind of thing upperhaps I should say downmuch longer
For myself I am feeling far from well it may have been the
lobsteror that last sentencebut

They were both silent Yet she said after a pause you can at
least take Mr Starling and his dyspepsia off my hands You might be
equal to that exertion

I suppose that by this time I ought to be doing something for
somebody he said thoughtfully Yes I will

That evening after dinner he took Mr Starling into the smokingroom
and cardroom They had something hot At 4 A M with the
assistance of the steward he projected Mr Starling into Mrs
Starlings stateroom delicately withdrawing to evade the ladys
thanks At breakfast he saw Miss Bike Thank you so much she said
Mrs Starling found Starling greatly improved He himself admitted he
was never berrer and far from worrying about what nightclothes he
should wear went to bed AS HE WASeven to his hat Mrs Starling
calls you her preserver and Mr Starling distinctly stated that you
were a jollygoodfler

And you asked John Lummox

In your present condition of abnormal selfconsciousness and
apperceptive egotism I really shouldnt like to say

When the voyage was ended Mr Lummox went to see Mary Bike at her
house and his fatherwhom he had not seen for ten yearsat HIS
house With a refined absence of natural affection he contented
himself with inquiring of the servants as to his fathers habits and
if he still wore dress clothes at dinner The information thus
elicited forced him to the conclusion that the old gentlemans
circumstances were reduced and that it was possible that he John
Lummox might be actually compelled to earn his own living He
communicated that suspicion to his father at dinner and over the last
bottle of Mouton a circumstance which also had determined him in his
resolution You might said his father thoughtfully offer yourself
to some rising American novelist as a study for the new heroone
absolutely without ambition capacity or energy willing however to
be whatever the novelist chooses to make him so long as he hasnt to
choose for himself If your inordinate selfconsciousness is still in
your way I could give him a few points about you myself

I had thought said John hesitatingly of going into your office
and becoming your partner in the business You could always look after
me you know

A shudder passed over the old man Then he tremblingly muttered to
himself

Thank heaven There is one way it may still be averted Retiring to
his room he calmly committed suicide thoughtfully leaving the empty
poison bottle in the fender

And this is how John Lummox came to offer himself as a clerk to Danl
Borem The ways of Providence are indeed strange yet those of the
novelist are only occasionally novel


III

John K Lummox lived for a week at the Turkey Buzzard Hotel exclusively
on doughnuts and innuendoes He was informed by Mr Borems
clerkwhose place he was to fillthat he wouldnt be able to stand
it and thus received the character of his employer from his last
employee

I suppose said Danl Borem chuckling that he said I was a old
skinflint good only at a hoss trade uneddicated ignorant and unable
to keep accounts and an oppressor o the widder and orphan Allowed
that my cute sayins was a kind o tencent parody o them proverbs in
Poor Richards Almanack

Omitting a few expletives he certainly did returned Lummox with
great delicacy

He allowed to me said Danl thoughtfully that YOU was a poor
critter that hadnt a single reason to show for livin that the
foolkiller had bin shadderin you from your birth and that you hadnt
paid a cent profit on your fathers original investment in ye nor on
the assessments hed paid on ye ever since He seems to be a cute
feller arter all and Im rather sorry hes leavin

I am quite willing to abandon my position in his favor now said
Lummox with alacrity

No said Danl rubbing his chin argumentatively the only way for
us to do is to circumvent him like in a hoss tradewith suthin
unexpected When he thinks youre goin to sleep in the shafts youll
run away and when he thinks Im vicious Ill let a woman or a child
drive me


IV

Well Danl hows that new clerk o yours gettin on said Mrs
Bigby a week later

Purty fine Hes good at accounts and hez got to know the Banks
customers by this time But I allus reckoned hed get stuck with some
o them counterfeit notesand he hez Ye see he aint accustomed to
look at a five or a ten dollar note as sharp as some men and hes
already taken in two tens and a five counterfeits

Gracious said Mrs Bigsby What did the poor feller do

Oh he ups and tells me all right after he discovered it And sez
he Ive charged my account with em sez he so the Bank wont lose
it

Why Danl said Mrs Bigsby ye didnt let that poor feller

You hol on said her brother business is business but I sez to
him Ye oughter put it down to Profit and Loss account Or perhaps
well have a chance o gettin rid o themnot in Noo York where
folks is sharp but here in the country and then ye kin credit
yourself with the amount arter youve got rid o them

Laws Im sorry ye did that Danl said Mrs Bigsby

With that he riz up continued Danl ignoring his sister and
takin them counterfeit notes from my hand sez he Them notes belong
to ME now sez he and Im goin to destroy em And with that he
walks over to the fire as stiff as a poker and held them notes in it
until they were burnt clean up

Well but that was honest and straightforward in him said Mrs
Bigsby

Um but it wasnt businessand ye see Danl paused and rubbed his
chin

Well go on said Mrs Bigsby impatiently

Well ye see neither him nor me was very smart in detectin
counterfeits or even knowin em and

Well For goodness sake Danl speak out

WellTHE DUM FOOL BURNT UP THREE GOOD BILLS and we neither of us
knew it


V

The unexpected which Danl Borem had hinted might characterize his
future conduct was first intimated by his treatment of the Widow
Cully an aged and impoverished woman whose property was heavily
mortgaged to him He had curtly summoned her to come to his office on
Christmas Day and settle up Frightened hopeless and in the face of
a snowstorm the old woman attended but was surprised by receiving a
satisfaction piece in full from the banker and a gorgeous Christmas
dinner All the same said Mrs Bigsby to Lummox Danl might hev
done all this without frightenin the poor old critter into a nervous
fever chillin her through by makin her walk two miles through the
snow and keepin her on the ragged edge o despair for two mortal
hours But its his humorous way

Did he give any reason for being so lenient to the widow asked
Lummox

He said that her son had given him a core of his apple when they were
boys together Danl ez mighty thoughtful o folks that was kind to
him in them days

Is that all said Lummox astonished

WellIve kinder thought suthin else said Mrs Bigsby hesitatingly

What

That its bein Christmas Dayand as Ive heard tell thats NO DAY IN
LAW but just like SundayDanl mebbe thought that he might crawl
outer that satisfaction piece ef he ever wanted ter Danl is mighty
cute


VI

Mr John Lummox was not behind his employer in developing unexpected
traits of character Hitherto holding aloof from his neighbors in Old
Folksville he suddenly went to a social gathering and distinguished
himself as the principal and popular guest of the evening As Danl
Borem afterward told his sister He was one o them Combination
Minstrels and Variety Shows in one He sang through a whole opery made
the pianner jest howl gave some recitations Casabianker and Betsy and
I are Out imitated all them tragedians did tricks with cards and
fetched rabbits outer hats besides liftin the pianner with two men
sittin on it jest by his teeth Created snakes said Borem
concluding his account which here is necessarily abbreviated ef he
learnt all that in his two years in Europe I aint sayin anythin more
agin eddication and furrin travel after this Why the next day
there was quite a run on the Bank jest to see HIM He is makin the
bizness poplar

Then ye think yell get along together

I reckon well hitch hosses said Danl with a smile

A few weeks later one evening Danl Borem sat with his sister alone
John Lummox who was now residing with them was attending a social
engagement Mrs Bigsby knew that Danl had something to communicate
but knew that he would do so in his own way

Speakin o hoss trades he began

We WASNT and we aint goin to said Mrs Bigsby with great
promptness Ive heard enough of em

But this here one hez suthin to do with your fren John Lummox
said Danl with a chuckle

Mrs Bigsby stared Go on then she said but for goodness sake
cut it short

Danl threw away his quid and replenished it from his silver tobacco
box Mrs Bigsby shuddered slightly as she recognized the usual
preliminary to prolixity but determined as far as possible to make
her brother brief

It mout be two weeks ago began Danl that I see John Lummox over
at Palmyra where hed bin visitin He was drivin a hoss the
beautifulest critterfor colorI ever saw It was yaller with mane
and tail a kinder golden like the hair o them British Blondes that
was here in the Variety Show

Danl exclaimed Mrs Bigsby horrified And you allowed you never
went thar

Saw em on the postersand mebbe the color was a little brighter
thar said Danl carelesslybut whos interruptin now

Go on said Mrs Bigsby

Got a fine hoss thar sez I reckon I never see such a purty
color sez I He is purty sez he peraps too purty for ME to be
adrivin but he isnt fast I aint speakin o that sez I
its his looks that Im talkin of whar might ye hev got him He
was offered to me by a fren o me boyhood sez he hes a pinto
mustang sez he from Californy whar they breed em Whats a
pinto hoss sez I The same ez a calico hoss sez he what they
have in cirkises but ye never see em that color En he was right
for when I looked him over I never DID see such a soft and silky coat
and his mane and tail jest glistened It IS a little too showy for
ye sez I but I might take him at a fair price Whats your fren
askin He wont sell him to anybody but me sez Lummox hes a
horror o hoss traders anyway and his price is more like a gift to a
fren What might that price be ef its a fair question sez I
for the more I looked at the hoss the more I liked him A hundred and
fifty dollars sez he but my fren would ask YOU double that
Couldnt YOU and ME make a trade sez I Ill exchange ye that roan
mare thats worth two hundred for this hoss and fifty dollars With
that he drew himself up and sez he Mr Borem sez he I share my
frens opinion about hoss tradin and I promised my mother Id never
swap hosses You ought to know me by this time

Thats so said Mrs Bigsby Im wonderin ye dared to ax him

Danl passed his hand over his mouth and continued I dunno but
youre right Lummox sez I peraps its jest as well as thar wasnt
TWO in the Bank in that bizness But the more I looked at the hoss
the more I hankered arter him Look here sez I I tell ye what
Ill do Ill LEND you my hoss and youll LEND me yourn Ill draw up
a paper to that effect and provide that in case o accidents ef I
dont return you your hoss Ill agree to pay you a hundred and fifty
dollars Youll give me the same kind o paper about my hosswith the
proviso that you pay me two hundred for him Excuse me Mr Borem
sez he but that difference of fifty makes a hoss trade accordin to
my mind Its agin my principles to make such an agreement

An he was right Danl said Mrs Bigsby approvingly

But Danl wiped his mouth again leaving however a singular smile on
it Well ez I wanted that hoss I jest thought and thought I knew I
could get two hundred and fifty for him easy and that Lummox didnt
know anythin of his valoo and I finally agreed to make the swap even
What do you call him sez I Pegasus sez hethe poets hoss
on account o his golden mane sez he That made me laff for I never
knew a poet ez could afford to hev a hossmuch less one like that
But I said Ill borry Pegasus o you on those terms The next day I
took the hoss to Jonesville Lummox was right he wasnt FAST but
jest as I expected he made a sensation Folks crowded round him
whenever I stopped wimmin followed him and children cried for him I
could hev sold him for three hundred without leavin town So ye call
him Pegasus sez Doc Smith grinnin I didnt known ye was subject
to the divine afflatus Danl I don offen hev it sez I but
when I do I find a little straight gin does me good So did Byron
sez he chucklin But even if I had called him Beelzebub the hull
town would hev bin jest as crazy over him Well as it was comin on
to rain I started jest after sundown for home But it came ter blow
an ter pour cats and dogs an I was nigh washed out o the buggy
besides losin my way and gettin inter ditches and puddles and I hed
to stop at Staples HalfWay House and put up for the night In the
mornin I riz up early and goes into the stable yard and the first
thing I sees was the ostler I hope ye giv my hoss a good scrub
down I sez as I told ye for his color is that delicate the
smallest spot shows Its a very rare color for a hoss I was
hopin it might be sez he I was a little huffed at that and I sez
Its considered a very beautiful color Mebbe it is sez he but I
never cared much for fireworks What yer mean sez I Look here
Squire sez he I dont mind scourin and rubbin down a hoss that
will stay the same color TWICE but when he gets to playin a
kaladeoskope on me I kick Trot him out sez I beginnin to feel
queer With that he fetched out the hoss For a minit I hed to ketch
on to the fence to keep myself from fallin I swonny ef he didnt
look like a case of measles on top o yaller fevercept where the
harness had touched him and that was kinder stenciled out all over
him Thar was places whar the ostler had washed down to the
foundation color a kind o chewed licorice Then I knew that somebody
had bin sold terrible and I reckoned it might be me But I said
nothin to the ostler and waited until dark when I drove him over
here and put him in the stables lettin no one see him In the
mornin Lummox comes to me and sez he Im glad to see you back sez
he for my conscience is troublin me about that hoss agreement it
looks too much like a hoss trade sez he and Im goin to send the
hoss back Mebbe your conscience sez I may trouble you a little
more ef youll step this way and with that I takes his arm and leads
him round to the stable and brings out the hoss

Well Lummox never changes ez much as a hair ez he puts up his
eyeglasses Im not good at whats called Poplar Art sez he Is
it a chromo or your own work sez he critical like

Its YOUR HOSS sez I

He looks at me a minit and then drors a paper from his pocket This
paper sez he in his quiet way was drored up by you and is a
covenant to return to me a yaller hoss with golden mane and tailor a
hundred and fifty dollars Ez I dont see the hoss anywheremebbe
youve got the hundred and fifty dollars handy sez he Suppose I
hadnt the money sez I I should be obliged sez he in a kind o
pained Christianmartyr way ter sell YOUR hoss for two hundred and
send the money to my fren We looked at each other steddy for a
minit and then I counts him out a hundred and fifty He took the money
sadlike and then sez Mr Borem sez he this is a great morril
lesson to us and went back to the office In the arternoon I called
in an old hoss dealer that I knew and shows him Pegasus

He wants renewin sez he

Wots that sez I

A few more bottles o that British Blonde Hair Dye to set him up
agin Thats wot they allus do in the cirkis whar he kem from

Then I went back to the office and I took down my sign Whats that
you re doin sez Lummox with a sickly kind o smile Are you goin
out o the bizness

No Im only goin to change that sign from Danl Borem to Borem
and Lummox sez I Ive concluded its cheaper for me to take you
inter partnership now than to continue in this way which would only
end in your hevin to take me in later I preferred to DO IT FUST


VII

A rich man and settled in business John Lummox concluded that he
would marry Mary Bike With that farsighted logic which had always
characterized him he reasoned that having first met her on a liner he
would find her again on one if he took passage to Europe He didbut
she was down on the passenger list as Mrs Edwin Wraggles The result
of their interview was given to Mrs Bigsby by Danl Borem in his own
dialect

Ez far as I kin see it was like the Deacons Sunday hoss trade bein
all Ef it wassent Ef ye wasnt Mrs Wraggles sez Lummox sez he
Id be tellin ye how Ive loved ye ever sence I first seed ye Ef ye
wasnt Mrs Wraggles Id be squeezin yer hand sez he ef ye wasnt
Mrs Wraggles Id be askin ye to marry me Then the gal ups and
sez sez she But I AINT Mrs Wraggles sez she Mrs Wraggles is
my sister and couldnt come so Im travelin on her ticket and
thats how my name is Wraggles on the passenger list But why didnt
ye tell me so at once sez Lummox This is an episoode o protracted
humor sez she and IM bound to have a show in it somehow

Well said Mrs Bigsby breathlessly then he DID marry her

Darned ef I know He never said so straight outbut thats like
Lummox




STORIES THREE

BY RDYD KPLG


I

FOR SIMLA REASONS

Some people say that improbable things dont necessarily happen in
Indiabut these people never find improbabilities anywhere This
sounds clever but you will at once perceive that it really means the
opposite of what I intended to say So well drop it What I am
trying to tell you is that after Sparkley had that affair with Miss
Millikens a singular change came over him He grew abstracted and
solitaryholding dark seances with himselfwhich was odd as
everybody knew he never cared a rap for the Millikens girl It was
even said that he was off his headwhich is rhyme But his reason was
undoubtedly affected for he had been heard to mutter incoherently at
the Club and strangest of all to answer questions THAT WERE NEVER
ASKED This was so awkward in that Branch of the Civil Department of
which he was a high officialwhere the rule was exactly the
reversethat he was presently invalided on full pay Then he
disappeared Clever people said it was because the Department was
afraid he had still much to answer for stupid people simply envied him

Mrs Awksby whom everybody knew had been the cause of breaking off the
match was now wild to know the reason of Sparkleys retirement She
attacked heaven and earth and even went a step higherto the Viceroy
At the viceregal ball I saw behind the curtains of a window her
rolling violetblue eyes with a singular glitter in them It was the
reflection of the Viceroys star although the rest of his Excellency
was hidden in the curtain I heard him saying Come now really now
you areyou know you are in reply to her cooing questioning Then
she made a dash at me and captured me

What did you hear

Nothing I should not have heard

Dont be like all the other menyou silly boy she answered I was
only trying to find out something about Sparkley And I will find it
out too she said clinching her thin little hand And whats more
she added turning on me suddenly YOU shall help me

I I said in surprise

Dont pretend she said poutingly Youre too clever to believe
hes cut up over the Millikens Noits something awful oranother
woman Now if I knew as much of India as you doand wasnt a woman
and could go where I likedId go to Bungloore and find him

Oh You have his address I said

Certainly What did you expect I was behind the curtain with the
Viceroy for she said opening her violet eyes innocently Its
BunglooreFirst Turning to the RightAt the End of the passage

Bungloorenear Ghouli Passin the Jungle I knew the place a spot
of dank pestilence and mystery You never could have gone there I
said

You do not know WHAT I could do for a FRIEND she said sweetly
veiling her eyes in demure significance

Oh come off the roof I said bluntly

She could be obedient when it was necessary She came off Not
without her revenge Try to remember you are not at school with the
Stalkies she said and turned away

I went to Bungloorenot on her account but my own If you dont
know India you wont know Bungloore Its all that and more An egg
dropped by a vulture sat upon and addled by the Department But I knew
the house and walked boldly in A lion walked out of one door as I
came in at another We did this two or three timesand found it
amusing A large cobra in the hall rose up bowed as I passed and
respectfully removed his hood

I found the poor old boy at the end of the passage It might have been
the passage between Calais and Doverhe looked so green so limp and
dejected I affected not to notice it and threw myself in a chair

He gazed at me for a moment and then said Did you hear what the chair
was saying

It was an ordinary bamboo armchair and had creaked after the usual
fashion of bamboo chairs I said so

He cast his eyes to the ceiling He calls it creaking he
murmured No matter he continued aloud its remark was not of a
complimentary nature Its very difficult to get really polite
furniture

The man was evidently stark staring mad I still affected not to
observe it and asked him if that was why he left Simla

There were Simla reasons certainly he replied But you think I
came here for solitude SOLITUDE he repeated with a laugh Why I
hold daily conversations with any blessed thing in this house from the
veranda to the chimneystack with any stick of furniture from the
footstool to the towelhorse I get more out of it than the gabble at
the Club You look surprised Listen I took this thing up in my
leisure hours in the Department I had read much about the
conversation of animals I argued that if animals conversed why
shouldnt inanimate things communicate with each other You cannot
prove that animals dont converseneither can you prove that inanimate
objects DO NOT See

I was thunderstruck with the force of his logic

Of course he continued there are degrees of intelligence and that
makes it difficult For instance a mahogany table would not talk like
a rushbottomed kitchen chair He stopped suddenly listened and
replied I really couldnt say

I didnt speak I said

I know YOU didnt But your chair asked me how long that fool was
going to stay I replied as you heard Pray dont moveI intend to
change that chair for one more accustomed to polite society To
continue I perfected myself in the language and it was awfully jolly
at first Whenever I went by train I heard not only all the engines
said but what every blessed carriage thought that joined in the
conversation If you chaps only knew what rot those whistles can get
off And as for the brakes they can beat any mule driver in cursing
Then after a time it got rather monotonous and I took a short sea
trip for my health But by Jove every blessed inch of the whole
shipfrom the screw to the bowsprithad something to say and the bad
language used by the garboard strake when the ship rolled was something
too awful You dont happen to know what the garboard strake is do
you

No I replied

No more do I Thats the dreadful thing about it Youve got to
listen to chaps that you dont know Why coming home on my bicycle
the other day there was an awful row between some infernal sprocket
and the ball bearings of the machine and I never knew before there
were such things in the whole concern

I thought I had got at his secret and said carelessly Then I suppose
this was the reason why you broke off your engagement with Miss
Millikens

Not at all he said coolly Nothing to do with it That is quite
another affair Its a very queer story would you like to hear it

By all means I took out my notebook

You remember that night of the Amateur Theatricals got up by the
White Hussars when the lights suddenly went out all over the house

Yes I replied I heard about it

Well I had gone down there that evening with the determination of
proposing to Mary Millikens the first chance that offered She sat
just in front of me her sister Jane next and her mother smart Widow
Millikenswho was a bit larky on her own account you rememberthe
next on the bench When the lights went out and the panic and
tittering began I saw my chance I leaned forward and in a voice
that would just reach Marys ear I said I have long wished to tell
you how my life is bound up with you dear and I never never can be
happy without youwhen just then there was a mighty big shove down my
bench from the fellows beyond me who were trying to get out But I
held on like grim death and struggled back again into position and
went on Youll forgive my taking a chance like this but I felt I
could no longer conceal my love for you when Im blest if there
wasnt another shove and though Id got hold of her little hand and
had a kind of squeeze in return I was drifted away again and had to
fight my way back But I managed to finish and said If the devotion
of a lifetime will atone for this hurried avowal of my love for you
let me hope for a response and just then the infernal lights were
turned on and there I was holding the widows hand and she nestling on
my shoulder and the two girls in hysterics on the other side You
see I never knew that they were shoved down on their bench every time
just as I was and of course when I got back to where I was Id just
skipped one of them each time Yes sir I had made that proposal in
THREE sectionsa part to each girl winding up with the mother No
explanation was possible and I left Simla next day Naturally it
wasnt a thing they could talk about either

Then you think Mrs Awksby had nothing to do with it I said

Nothingabsolutely nothing By the way if you see that lady you
might tell her that I have possession of that brocade easychair which
used to stand in the corner of her boudoir You remember itfaded
white and yellow with one of the casters off and a little frayed at
the back but rather softspoken and amiable But of course you dont
understand THAT I bought it after she moved into her new bungalow

But why should I tell her that I asked in wonder

Nothingexcept that I find it very amusing with its reminiscences of
the company she used to entertain and her confidences generally
Goodbytake care of the lion in the hall He always couches on the
left for a spring Tata

I hurried away When I returned to Simla I told Mrs Awksby of my
discoveries and spoke of the armchair

I fancied she colored slightly but quickly recovered

Dear old Sparkley she said sweetly he WAS a champion liar


II

A PRIVATES HONOR

I had not seen Mulledwiney for several days Knowing the manthis
looked bad So I dropped in on the Colonel I found him in deep
thought This looked bad too for old Cockey Waxas he was known to
everybody in the Hill districts but himselfwasnt given to thinking
I guessed the cause and told him so

Yes he said wearily you are right Its the old story
Mulledwiney Bleareyed and Otherwise are at it againdrink followed
by Clink Even now two corporals and a private are sitting on
Mulledwineys head to keep him quiet and Bleareyed is chained to an
elephant

Perhaps I suggested you are unnecessarily severe

Do you really think so Thank you so much I am always glad to have
a civilians opinion on military mattersand vice versait broadens
one so And yetam I severe I am willing for instance to overlook
their raid upon a native village and the ransom they demanded for a
native inspector I have overlooked their taking the horses out of my
carriage for their own use I am content also to believe that my fowls
meekly succumb to jungle fever and cholera But there are some things
I cannot ignore The carrying off of the great god Vishnu from the
Sacred Shrine at Ducidbad by The Three for the sake of the priceless
opals in its eyes

But I never heard of THAT I interrupted eagerly Tell me

Ah said the Colonel playfully thatas you so often and so
amusingly sayis Another Story Yet I would have overlooked the
theft of the opals if they had not substituted two of the Queens
regimental buttons for the eyes of the god This while it did not
deceive the ignorant priests had a deep political and racial
significance You are aware of course that the great mutiny was
occasioned by the issue of cartridges to the native troops greased with
hogs fatforbidden by their religion

But these three men could themselves alone quell a mutiny I replied

The Colonel grasped my hand warmly Thank you So they could I
never thought of that He looked relieved For all that he
presently passed his hand over his forehead and nervously chewed his
cheroot

There is something else I said

You are right There is It is a secret Promise me it shall go no
furtherthan the Press Nay swear that you will KEEP it for the
Press

I promise

Thank you SO much It is a matter of my own and Mulledwineys The
fact is we have had a PERSONAL difficulty He paused glanced around
him and continued in a low agitated voice Yesterday I came upon him
as he was sitting leaning against the barrack wall In a spirit of
playfulnessmere playfulness I assure you sirI poked him lightly
in the shoulder with my stick saying Boo He turnedand I shall
never forget the look he gave me

Good heavens I gasped you touchedabsolutely
TOUCHEDMulledwiney

Yes he said hurriedly I knew what you would say it was against
the Queens Regulationsandthere was his sensitive nature which
shrinks from even a harsh word but I did it and of course he has me
in his power

And you have touched him I repeatedtouched his private honor

Yes But I shall atone for it I have already arranged with him that
we shall have it out between ourselves alone in the jungle stripped
to the buff with our fistsQueensberry rules I havent fought since
I stood up against Spinks Majoryou remember old Spinks now of the
Bombay Offensiblesat Eton And the old boy pluckily bared his
skinny arm

It may be serious I said

I have thought of that I have a wife several children and an aged
parent in England If I fall they must never know You must invent a
story for them I have thought of cholera but that is played out you
know we have already tried it on The Boy who was Thrown Away Invent
something quiet peaceable and respectableas far removed from
fighting as possible What do you say to measles

Not half bad I returned

Measles let it be then Say I caught it from Wee Willie Winkie You
do not think it too incredible he added timidly

Not more than YOUR story I said

He grasped my hand struggling violently with his emotion Then he
struggled with meand I left hurriedly Poor old boy The funeral
was well attended however and no one knew the truth not even myself


III

JUNGLE FOLK

It was high noon of a warm summers day when Moo Kow came down to the
wateringplace Miaow otherwise known as Puskatthe warmthloving
onewas crouching on a limb that overhung the pool sunning herself
Brer Rabbitbut that is Another Story by Another Person

Three or four Gee Gees already at the pool moved away on the approach
of Moo Kow

Why do ye stand aside said the Moo Kow

Why do you say ye said the Gee Gees together

Because its more impressive than you Dont you know that all
animals talk that way in English said the Moo Kow

And they also say thou and dont you forget it interrupted Miaow
from the tree I learnt that from a Man Cub

The animals were silent They did not like Miaows slang and were
jealous of her occasionally sitting on a Man Cubs lap Once Dunkee a
poor relation of the Gee Gees had tried it on disastrouslybut that
is also Another and a more Aged Story

We are ridden by The Englishplease to observe the Capital letters
said Pi Bol the leader of the Gee Gees proudly They are a mighty
race who ride anything and everybody Dye mind thatI mean look ye
well to it

What should they know of England who only England know said Miaow

Is that a conundrum asked the Moo Kow

No its poetry said the Miaow

I know England said Pi Bol prancingly I used to go from the Bank
to Islington three times a dayI mean he added hurriedly before I
became a screwI should say a screwgun horse

And I said the Moo Kow am terrible When the young women and
children in the village see me approach they fly shriekingly My
presence alone has scattered their sacred festivalThe Sundes Kool
Piknik I strike terror to their inmost souls and am more feared by
them than even Kreepmows the insidious And yet behold I have
taken the place of the mothers of men and I have nourished the mighty
ones of the earth But that said the Moo Kow turning her head aside
bashfully that is Anudder Story

A dead silence fell on the pool

And I said Miaow lifting up her voice I am the horror and haunter
of the night season When I pass like the night wind over the roofs of
the houses men shudder in their beds and tremble When they hear my
voice as I creep stealthily along their balconies they cry to their
gods for succor They arise and from their windows they offer me
their priceless household treasuresthe sacred vessels dedicated to
their great god Shivwhich they call Shivin Mugsthe Kloes Brosh
the Boojak urging me to fly them And yet said Miaow mournfully
it is but my lovesong Think ye what they would do if I were on the
warpath

Another dead silence fell on the pool Then arose that strange
mysterious indefinable Thing known as The Scent The animals
sniffed

It heralds the approach of the Stalkiesthe most famous of British
Skool Boaz said the Moo Kow They have just placed a decaying
guineapig two white mice in an advanced state of decomposition and a
single slice of Limburger cheese in the bed of their tutor They had
previously skillfully diverted the drains so that they emptied into the
drawingroom of the headmaster They have just burned down his house
in an access of noble zeal and are fighting among themselves for the
spoil Hark do ye hear them

A wild medley of shrieks and howls had arisen and an irregular mob of
strange creatures swept out of the distance toward the pool Some were
like pygmies some had bloody noses Their talk consisted of feverish
breathless ejaculationsa gibberish in which the words rot oach
and giddy were preeminent Some were exciting themselves by chewing
a kind of bhang made from the plant called pappahmint others had
their faces streaked with djam

But who is this they are ducking in the pool asked Pi Bol

It is one who has foolishly and wantonly conceived that his parents
have sent him here to study said the Moo Kow but that is against
the rules of the Stalkies who accept study only as a punishment

Then these be surely the Bander Logthe monkey folkof whom the
good Rhuddyidd has told us said a Gee Geethe ones who have no
purposeand forget everything

Fool said the Moo Kow Know ye not that the great Rhuddyidd has
said that the Stalkies become MajorGenerals V Cs and C Bs of
the English Truly they are great Look now ye shall see one of the
greatest traits of the English Stalky

One of the pygmy Stalkies was offering a bun to a larger one who
hesitated but took it coldly

Behold it is one of the greatest traits of this mighty race not to
show any emotion He WOULD take the bunhe HAS taken it He is
pleasedbut he may not show it Observe him eat

The taller Stalky after eating the bun quietly kicked the giver
knocked off his hat and turned away with a calm immovable face

Good said the Moo Kow Ye would not dream that he was absolutely
choking with grateful emotion

We would not said the animals

But why are they all running back the way they came asked Pi Bol

They are going back to punishment Great is its power Have ye not
heard the gospel of Rhuddyidd the mighty Force is everything
Gentleness wont wash courtesy is deceitful Politeness is foreign
Be ye beaten that ye may beat Pass the kick on

But here he was interrupted by the appearance of three soldiers who
were approaching the wateringplace

Ye are now said the Moo Kow with the main guard The first is
Bleareyed who carries a raven in a cage which he has stolen from the
wife of a deputy commissioner He will paint the bird snow white and
sell it as a dove to the same lady The second is Otherwise who is
dragging a small garden engine of which he has despoiled a native
gardener whom he has felled with a single blow The third is
Mulledwiney swinging a cutglass decanter of sherry which he has just
snatched from the table of his colonel Mulledwiney and Otherwise will
play the engine upon Bleareyed who is suffering from heat apoplexy and
djimdjams

The three soldiers seated themselves in the pool

They are going to tell awful war stories now said the Moo Kow
stories that are large and strong Some people are shockedothers
like em

Then he that was called Mulledwiney told a story In the middle of it
Miaow got up from the limb of the tree coughed slightly and put her
paw delicately over her mouth You must excuse me she said faintly
I am taken this way sometimesand I have left my salts at home
Thanks I can get down myself The next moment she had disappeared
but was heard coughing in the distance

Mulledwiney winked at his companions and continued his story

Wid that we wor in the thick av the foight Whin I say thick I mane
it sorr We wor that jammed together divil a bit cud we shoot or
cut At furrest I had lashed two mushkits together wid the baynits
out so like a hay fork and getting the haymakers lift on thim I
just lifted two Paythians outone an aych baynitand passed em
aisylike over me head to the rear rank for them to finish But what
wid the blud gettin into me ois I was blinded and the pressure kept
incraysin until me arrums was thrussed like a fowl to me sides and
sorra a bit cud I move but me jaws

And bloomin well you knew how to use them said Otherwise

Thrue for youthough ye dont mane it said Mulledwiney playfully
tapping Otherwise on the head with a decanter till the cut glass slowly
shivered So begorra there wor nothing left for me to do but to ATE
thim Wirra but it was the crooel worruk

Excuse me my lord interrupted the gasping voice of Pi Bol as he
began to back from the pool I am but a horse I know and being built
in that waynaturally have the stomach of oneyet really my lord
thiser And his voice was gone

The next moment he had disappeared Mulledwiney looked around with
affected concern

Save us But weve cleaned out the Jungle Sure theres not a baste
left but ourselves

It was true The wateringplace was empty Moo Kow Miaow and the
Gee Gees had disappeared Presently there was a booming crash and a
long deep rumbling among the distant hills Then they knew they were
near the old Moulmein Pagoda and the dawn had come up like thunder out
of China cross the bay It always came up that way there The strain
was too great and day was actually breaking




ZUTSKI

THE PROBLEM OF A WICKED FEME SOLE

BY MRE CRLLI


I

The great pyramid towered up from the desert with its apex toward the
moon which hung in the sky For centuries it had stood thus
disdaining the aid of gods or man being as the Sphinx herself
observed able to stand up for itself And this was no small praise
from that sublime yet mysterious female who had seen the ages come and
go empires rise and fall novelist succeed novelist and who for eons
and cycles the cynosure and centre of admiration and mens idolatrous
worship had yetwonderful for a womanthrough it all kept her head
which now alone remained to survey calmly the present Indeed at that
moment that magnificent and peaceful face seemed to have lostwith a
few unimportant featuresits usual expression of speculative wisdom
and intense disdain its mouth smiled its left eyelid seemed to droop
As the opal tints of dawn deepened upon it the eyelid seemed to droop
lower closed and quickly recovered itself twice You would have
thought the Sphinx had winked

Then arose a voice like a wind on the desertbut really from the
direction of the Nile where a hired dahabiyeh lay moored to the
bankArry Axes Arry Axes With it came also a flapping
trailing vision from the waterthe sacred Ibis itselfand with wings
aslant drifted mournfully away to its own creaking echo Kraksis
Kraksis Again arose the weird voice Arry Axes Wotcher doin
of And again the Ibis croaked its wild refrain Kraksis
Kraksis Moonlight and the hour wove their own mystery for which
the author is not responsible and the voice was heard no more But
when the full day sprang in glory over the desert it illuminated the
few remaining but sufficiently large features of the Sphinx with a
burning saffron radiance The Sphinx had indeed blushed


II

It was the full season at Cairo The wealth and fashion of Bayswater
South Kensington and even the bosky Wood of the Evangelist had sent
their latest luxury and style to flout the tombs of the past with the
ghastly flippancy of today The cheap tripper was therethe latest
example of the Darwinian theoryapelike flea and curio hunting
Shamelessly inquisitive and always hungry what did he know of the
Sphinx or the pyramids or the voiceand for the matter of that what
did they know of him And yet he was not half bad in comparison with
the swagger peoplethese people who pretend to have lungs and what
not and instead of galloping on merry hunters through the frost and
snow of Piccadilly and Park instead of enjoying the roaring fires of
piled logs in the evening at the first approach of winter steal away
to the Land of the Sun and decline to die like honest Britons on
British soil And then they know nothing of the Egyptians and are
horrified at bakshish which they really ought to pay for the
privilege of shocking the straightlimbed nakedfooted Arab in his
single rough garment with their baggy elephantlegged trousers And
they know nothing of the mystic land of the old gods filled with
profound enigmas of the supernatural dark secrets yet unexplored
except in this book Well might the great Memnon murmur after this
lapse of these thousand years Theyre making me tired

Such was the blissful selfsatisfied ignorance of Sir Midas Pyle or
as Lord FitzFulke with his delightful imitation of the East London
accent called him Sir Myde His Pyle as he leaned back on his divan
in the Grand Cairo Hotel He was the vulgar editor and proprietor of a
vulgar London newspaper and had brought his wife with him who was
vainly trying to marry off his faded daughters There was to be a
fancydress ball at the hotel that night and Lady Pyle hoped that her
girls if properly disguised might have a better chance Here too
was Lady FitzFulke whose mother was immortalized by Byronsixty if a
day yet still dressing youthfullywho had sought the land of the
Sphinx in the faint hope that in the contiguity of that lady she might
pass for being young Alaster McFeckless a splendid young
Scotchmanalready dressed as a Florentine sailor of the fifteenth
century which enabled him to show his magnificent calves quite as well
as in his native highland dress and who had added with characteristic
noble pride a sporran to his costume was lolling on another divan

Oh those exquisite those magnificent eyes of hers Eh sirs he
murmured suddenly as waking from a dream

Oh damn her eyes said Lord FitzFulke languidly Tell you what
old man youre just gone on that girl

Ha roared McFeckless springing to his feet ye will be using such
language of the bonniest

You will excuse me gentlemen said Sir Midaswho hated scenes
unless he had a trusted reporter with himbut I think it is time for
me to go upstairs and put on my Windsor uniform which I find
exceedingly convenient for these mixed assemblies He withdrew
caressing his protuberant paunch with some dignity as the two men
glanced fiercely at each other

In another moment they might have sprung at each others throats But
luckily at this instant a curtain was pushed aside as if by some
waiting listener and a thin man entered dressed in cap and
gownwhich would have been simply academic but for his carrying in
one hand behind him a bundle of birch twigs It was Dr Haustus
Pilgrim a noted London practitioner and specialist dressed as Ye
Oldefashioned Pedagogue He was presumably spending his holiday on
the Nile in a large dahabiyeh with a number of friends among whom he
counted the two momentary antagonists he had just interrupted but
those who knew the doctors farreaching knowledge and cryptic
researches believed he had his own scientific motives

The two men turned quickly as he entered the angry light faded from
their eyes and an awed and respectful submission to the intruder took
its place He walked quietly toward them put a lozenge in the mouth
of one and felt the pulse of the other gazing critically at both

We will be all right in a moment he said with professional
confidence

I say said FitzFulke gazing at the doctors costume you look
dooced smart in those togs dontcherknow

They suit me said the doctor with a playful swish of his birch
twigs at which the two grave men shuddered But you were speaking of
somebodys beautiful eyes

The Princess ZutSkis returned McFeckless eagerly and this daft
callant said

He didnt like them put in FitzFulke promptly

Ha said the doctor sharply and why not sir As FitzFulke
hesitated he added brusquely There Run away and play Ive
business with this young man pointing to McFeckless

As FitzFulke escaped gladly from the room the doctor turned to
McFeckless It wont do my boy The Princess is not for youyoull
only break your heart and ruin your family over her Thats my advice
Chuck her

But I cannot said McFeckless humbly Think of her weirdly
beautiful eyes

I see said the doctor meditatively sort of makes you feel creepy
Kind of alloverishness eh Thats like her But whom have we here

He was staring at a striking figure that had just entered closely
followed by a crowd of admiring spectators And indeed he seemed
worthy of the homage His magnificent form was closely attired in a
velveteen jacket and trousers with a singular display of pearl buttons
along the seams that were absolutely lavish in their quantity a hat
adorned with feathers and roses completed his singularly picturesque
equipment

Chevalier burst out McFeckless in breathless greeting

Ah mon ami What good chance returned the newcomer rushing to him
and kissing him on both cheeks to the British horror of Sir Midas who
had followed Ah but you are perfect he added kissing his fingers
in admiration of McFecklesss Florentine dress

But youwhat is this ravishing costume asked McFeckless with a
pang of jealousy You are godlike

It is the dress of what you call the Koster a transplanted Phenician
tribe answered the other They who knocked em in the road of Old
Kentknow you not the legend As he spoke he lifted his superb form
to a warriors height and gesture

But is this quite correct asked FitzFulke of the doctor

Perfectly said the doctor oracularly The renowned Arry AxesI
beg his pardon he interrupted himself hastily I mean the
Chevalieris perfect in his archaeology and ethnology The Koster is
originally a Gypsy which is but a corruption of the word Egyptian
and if I mistake not that gentleman is a lineal descendant

But he is called Chevalier and he speaks like a Frenchman said
Fluffy

And being a Frenchman of course knows nothing outside of Paris
said Sir Midas

We are in the Land of Mystery said the doctor gravely in a low
voice You have heard of the Egyptian Hall and the Temple of Mystery

A shudder passed through many that were there but the majority were
following with wild adulation the superb Koster who with elbows
slightly outward and hands turned inward was passing toward the
ballroom McFeckless accompanied him with conflicting emotions Would
he see the incomparable Princess who was lovelier and even still more
a mystery than the Chevalier Would sheterrible thoughtsuccumb to
his perfections


III

The Princess was already there surrounded by a crowd of admirers
equal if not superior to those who were following the superb Chevalier
Indeed they met almost as rivals Their eyes sought each other in
splendid competition The Chevalier turned away dazzled and
incoherent She is adorable magnificent he gasped to McFeckless
I love her on the instant Behold I am transported ravished
Present me

Indeed as she stood there in a strange gauzy garment of exquisite
colors apparently shapeless yet now and then revealing her perfect
figure like a bather seen through undulating billows she was lovely
Two wands were held in her taper fingers whose mystery only added to
the general curiosity but whose weird and cabalistic uses were to be
seen later Her magnificent facestrange in its beautywas stranger
still since with perfect archaeological Egyptian correctness she
presented it only in profile at whatever angle the spectator stood
But such a profile The words of the great PoetKing rose to
McFecklesss lips Her nose is as a tower that looketh toward
Damascus

He hesitated a moment torn with love and jealousy and then presented
his friend You will fall in love with herand thenyou will fall
also by my hand he hissed in his rivals ear and fled tumultuously

Voulezvous danser mademoiselle whispered the Chevalier in the
perfect accent of the boulevardier

Merci beaucoup she replied in the diplomatic courtesies of the
Ambassadeurs

They danced together not once but many times to the admiration the
wonder and envy of all to the scandalized reprobation of a proper few
Who was she Who was he It was easy to answer the last question the
world rang with the reputation of Chevalier the Artist But she was
still a mystery

Perhaps they were not so to each other He was gazing deliriously into
her eyes She was looking at him in disdainful curiosity Ive seen
you before somewhere havent I she said at last with a crushing
significance

He shuddered he knew not why and passed his hand over his high
forehead Yes I go there very often he replied vacantly But
you mademoiselleyouI have met before

Oh ages ages ago There was something weird in her emphasis

Ha said a voice near them I thought so It was the doctor
peering at them curiously And you both feel rather dazed and
creepy He suddenly felt their pulses lingering however as the
Chevalier fancied somewhat longer than necessary over the ladys wrist
and beautiful arm He then put a small round box in the Chevaliers
hand saying One before each meal and turning to the lady with
caressing professional accents said We must wrap ourselves closely
and endeavor to induce perspiration and hurried away dragging the
Chevalier with him When they reached a secluded corner he said You
had just now a kind of feeling dont you know as if youd sort of
been there before didnt you

Yes what you call apreexistence said the Chevalier wonderingly

Yes I have often observed that those who doubt a future state of
existence have no hesitation in accepting a previous one said the
doctor dryly But come I see from the way the crowd are hurrying
that your divinitys number is upI mean he corrected himself
hastily that she is probably dancing again

Aha with him the imbecile McFeckless gasped the Chevalier

No alone

She was indeed alone in the centre of the ballroomwith outstretched
arms revolving in an occult weird dreamy mystic druidical
cabalistic circle They now for the first time perceived the meaning
of those strange wands which appeared to be attached to the many folds
of her diaphanous skirts and involved her in a fleecy whirling cloud
Yet in the wild convolutions of her garments and the mad gyrations of
her figure her face was upturned with the seraphic intensity of a
devotee and her lips parted as with the impassioned appeal for Light
more light And the appeal was answered A flood of blue crimson
yellow and green radiance was alternately poured upon her from the
black box of a mysterious Nubian slave in the gallery The effect was
marvelous at one moment she appeared as a martyr in a sheet of flame
at another as an angel wrapped in white and muffled purity and again
as a nymph of the cerulean sea and then suddenly a cloud of darkness
seemed to descend upon her through which for an instant her figure as
immaculate and perfect as a marble statue showed distinctlythen the
light went out and she vanished

The whole assembly burst into a rapturous cry Even the common Arab
attendants who were peeping in at the doors raised their melodious
native cry Alloe Fullah Aloe Fullah again and again

A shocked silence followed Then the voice of Sir Midas Pyle was heard
addressing Dr Haustus Pilgrim

May we not presume sir that what we have just seen is not unlike
that remarkable exhibition when I was pained to meet you one evening at
the Alhambra

The doctor coughed slightly The Alhambraah yesyouerrefer
I presume to Granada and the Land of the Moor where we last met The
music and dance are both distinctly Moorishwhich after all is akin
to the Egyptian I am gratified indeed that your memory should be so
retentive and your archaeological comparison so accurate But see the
ladies are retiring Let us follow


IV

The intoxication produced by the performance of the Princess naturally
had its reaction The British moral soul startled out of its
hypocrisy the night before demanded the bitter beer of
selfconsciousness and remorse the next morning The ladies were now
openly shocked at what they had secretly envied Lady Pyle was
however propitiated by the doctors assurance that the Princess was a
friend of Lady FitzFulke who had promised to lend her youthful age
and aristocratic prestige to the return ball which the Princess had
determined to give at her own home Still I think the Princess open
to criticism said Sir Midas oracularly

Damn all criticism and critics burst out McFeckless with the noble
frankness of a passionate and yet unfettered soul Sir Midas who
employed critics in his business as he did other base and ignoble
slaves drew up himself and his paunch and walked away

The Chevalier cast a superb look at McFeckless Voila Regard me
well I shall seek out this Princess when she is with herself Alone
comprenez I shall seek her at her hotel in the Egyptian Hall Ha
ha I shall seek ZutSki Zut And he made that rapid yet graceful
motion of his palm against his thigh known only to the true Parisian

Its a rum hole where she lives and nobody gets a sight of her said
Flossy Its like a beastly family vault dont you know outside
and theres a kind of nigger doorkeeper that vises you and chucks you
out if you havent the straight tip Ill show you the way if you
like

Allons en avant said the Chevalier gayly I precipitate myself
there on the instant

Remember hissed McFeckless grasping his arm you shall account to
me

Bien said the Chevalier shaking him off lightly All
arrright Then in that incomparable baritone which had so often
enthralled thousands he moved away trolling the first verse of the
Princesss own faint sweet sad song of the Lotus Lily that
thrilled McFeckless even through the Chevaliers marked French accent

 Oh a hard zing to get is ze Lotus Lillee
 She lif in ze swampin ze watair chillee
 She make your foot wetand you look so sillee
 But you buy her for sixpence in Piccadillee


In half an hour the two men reached the remote suburb where the
Princess lived a gloomy windowless building Pausing under a low
archway over which in Egyptian characters appeared the faded legend
Sta Ged Oor they found a Nubian slave blocking the dim entrance

I leave you here said Flossy hurriedly as even I left once
beforeonly then I was lightly assisted by his sandaled foot he
added rubbing himself thoughtfully But better luck to you

As his companion retreated swiftly the Chevalier turned to the slave
and would have passed in but the man stopped him Got a pass boss

No said the Chevalier

The man looked at him keenly Oh I see one of de profesh

The Chevalier nodded haughtily The man preceded him by devious
narrow ways and dark staircases coming abruptly upon a small apartment
where the Princess sat on a low divan A single lamp inclosed in an
ominous wire cage flared above her Strange things lay about the floor
and shelves and from another door he could see hideous masks
frightful heads and disproportionate faces He shuddered slightly
but recovered himself and fell on his knees before her I lofe you
he said madly I have always lofed you

For how long she asked with a strange smile

He covertly consulted his shirt cuff For tree tousand fife hundred
and sixtytwo years he said rapidly

She looked at him disdainfully The doctor has been putting you up to
that It wont wash I dont refer to your shirt cuff she added
with deep satire

Adorable one he broke out passionately attempting to embrace her
I have come to take you Without moving she touched a knob in the
wall A trapdoor beyond him sank and out of the bowels of the earth
leaped three indescribable demons Then rising she took a cake of
chalk from the table and drawing a mystic half circle on the floor
returned to the divan lit a cigarette and leaning comfortably back
said in a low monotonous voice Advance one foot within that magic
line and on that head although it wore a crown I launch the curse of
Rome

Ionly wanted to take youwith a kodak he said with a light laugh
to conceal his confusion as he produced the instrument from his
coattail pocket

Not with that cheap box she said rising with magnificent disdain
Come again with a decent instrumentand perhaps Then lightly
humming in a pure contralto Ive been photographed like thisIve
been photographed like that she summoned the slave to conduct him
back and vanished through a canvas screen which nevertheless seemed
to the dazed Chevalier to be the stony front of the pyramids


V

And you saw her said the doctor in French

Yes but the threethousandyear gag did not work She spotted you
cher ami on the instant And she wouldnt let me take her with my
kodak

The doctor looked grave I see he mused thoughtfully You must
have my camera a larger one and more bulky perhaps to carry but she
will not object to thatshe who has stood for full lengths I will
give you some private instructions

But cher doctor this previousexistence ideaat what do you arrive

There is much to say for it said the doctor oracularly It has
survived in the belief of all ages Who can tell That some men in a
previous existence may have been goats or apes continued the doctor
looking at him curiously does not seem improbable From the time of
Pythagoras we have known that but that the individual as an individual
ego has been remanded or projected has harked back or anticipated
himself is we may say with our powers of apperceptionthat is the
perception that we are perceivingis

But the Chevalier had fled No matter said the doctor I will see
McFeckless He did He found him gloomy distraught baleful He
felt his pulse The mixture as before he said briefly and a
little innocent diversion There is an Aunt Sally on the
esplanadetwo throws for a penny It will do you good Think no more
of this woman ListenI wish you well your family have always been
good patients of mine Marry some good Scotch girl I know one with
fifty thousand pounds Let the Princess go

To himnever I will marry her Yet he murmured softly to
himself feefty thousand pun is nae small sum Aye Not that I care
for sillerbut feefty thousand pun Eh sirs


VI

Dr Haustus knew that the Chevalier had again visited the Princess
although he had kept the visit a secretand indeed was himself
invisible for a day or two afterwards At last the doctors curiosity
induced him to visit the Chevaliers apartment Entering he was
surprisedeven in that Land of Mysteryto find the room profoundly
dark smelling of Eastern drugs and the Chevalier sitting before a
large plate of glass which he was examining by the aid of a lurid ruby
lampthe only light in the weird gloom His face was pale and
distraught his locks were disheveled

Voila he said Mon Dieu It is my third attempt Always the
samehideous monstrous unearthly It is she and yet it is not she

The doctor professional man as he was and inured to such spectacles
was startled The plate before him showed the Princesss face in all
its beautiful contour but only dimly veiling a ghastly deathshead
below There was the whole bony structure of the head and the eyeless
sockets even the graceful swanlike neck showed the articulated
vertebral column that supported it in all its hideous reality The
beautiful shoulders were there dimly as in a dreambut beneath was
the empty clavicle the knotty joint the hollow sternum and the ribs
of a skeleton half length

The doctors voice broke the silence My friend he said dryly you
see only the truth You see what she really is this peerless Princess
of yours You see her as she is today and you see her kinship to the
bones that have lain for centuries in yonder pyramid Yet they were
once as fair as this and this was as fair as theyin effect the same
You that have madly impiously adored her superficial beauty the mere
dust of tomorrow let this be a warning to you You that have no soul
to speak of let that suffice you Take her and be happy Adieu

Yet as he passed out of the fitting tomblike gloom of the apartment
and descended the stairs he murmured to himself Odd that I should
have lent him my camera with the Rontgenray attachment still on No
matter It is not the first time that the Princess has appeared in two
parts the same evening


VII

In spite of envy jealousy and malice a certain curiosity greater
than all these drew everybody to the Princess ZutSkis ball Lady
FitzFulke was there in virgin white looking more youthful than ever
in spite of her sixtyfive years and the card labeled Fresh Paint
which somebody had playfully placed upon her enameled shoulder The
McFecklesses the Pyles Flossy the doctor and the Chevalierlooking
still anxiouswere in attendance

The mysterious Nubian doorkeeper admitted the guests through the same
narrow passages much to the disgust of Lady Pyle and the discomfiture
of her paunchy husband but on reaching a large circular interior hall
a greater surprise was in store for them It was found that the only
entrance to the body of the hall was along a narrow ledge against the
bare wall some distance from the floor which obliged the guests to
walk slowly in single file along this precarious strip giving them
the attitudes of an Egyptian frieze which was suggested in the
original plaster above them It is needless to say that while the
effect was ingenious and striking from the centre of the room where
the Princess stood with a few personal friends it was exceedingly
uncomfortable to the figures themselves in their enforced march along
the ledgeespecially a figure of Sir Midas Pyles proportions
Suddenly an exclamation broke from the doctor

Do you see he said to the Princess pointing to the figure of the
Chevalier who was filing along with his sinewy hands slightly turned
inward how surprisingly like he is to the first attendant on the King
in the real frieze above And that added the doctor was none other
than Arry Axes the Egyptian you are always thinking of And he
peered curiously at her

Goodness me murmured the Princess in an Arabic much more soft and
fluent than the original gum So he doeslook like him

And do you know you look like him too Would you mind taking a walk
around together

They did amid the acclamations of the crowd The likeness was
perfect The Princess however was quite white as she eagerly
rejoined the doctor

And this means she hissed in a low whisper

That he is the real Arry Axes Hush not a word now We join the
dahabiyeh tonight At daybreak you will meet him at the fourth angle
of the pyramid first turning from the Nile


VIII

The crescent moon hung again over the apex of the Great Pyramid like a
silver cutting from the rosy nail of a houri The Sphinxmighty
guesser of riddles reader of rebuses and universal solver of missing
wordslooked over the unfathomable desert and these few pages with
the worried hopeless expression of one who is obliged at last to give
it up And then the wailing voice of a woman toiling up the steep
steps of the pyramid was heard above the creaking of the Ibis Arry
Axes Where are you Wait for me

Jy suis said a voice from the very summit of the stupendous granite
bulk yet I cannot reach it

And in that faint light the figure of a man was seen lifting his arms
wildly toward the moon

Arry Axes persisted the voice drifting higher wait for me we
are pursued

And indeed it was true A band of Nubians headed by the doctor was
already swarming like ants up the pyramid and the unhappy pair were
secured And when the sun rose it was upon the white sails of the
dahabiyeh the vacant pyramid and the slumbering Sphinx


There was great excitement at the Cairo Hotel the next morning The
Princess and the Chevalier had disappeared and with them Alaster
McFeckless Lady FitzFulke the doctor and even his dahabiyeh A
thousand rumors had been in circulation Sir Midas Pyle looked up from
the Times with his usual Itoldyouso expression

It is the most extraordinary thing dontcherknow said FitzFulke
It seems that Dr Haustus Pilgrim was here professionallyas a nerve
specialistin the treatment of hallucinations produced by neurotic
conditions you know

A mad doctor here gasped Sir Midas

Yes The Princess the Chevalier McFeckless and even my mother were
all patients of his on the dahabiyeh He believed dontcherknow in
humoring them and letting them follow out their cranks under his
management The Princess was a musichall artist who imagined she was
a dead and gone Egyptian Princess and the queerest of all Arry Axes
was also a musichall singer who imagined himself Chevalieryou know
the great Koster artistand thats how we took him for a Frenchman
McFeckless and my poor old mother were the only ones with any real rank
and positionbut you know what a beastly bounder Mac was and the poor
mater DID overdo the youthful We never called the doctor in until the
day she wanted to go to a swell ball in London as Little Red
Ridinghood But the doctor writes me that the experiment was a
success and theyll be all right when they get back to London

Then it seems sir that you and I were the only sane ones here
said Sir Midas furiously

Really its as much as I can do to be certain about myself old
chappie said FitzFulke turning away

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To

particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff
