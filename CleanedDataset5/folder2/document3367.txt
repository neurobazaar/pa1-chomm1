A HAZARD OF NEW FORTUNES

By William Dean Howells



PART SECOND


I

The evening when March closed with Mrs Greens reduced offer and
decided to take her apartment the widow whose lodgings he had rejected
sat with her daughter in an upper room at the back of her house In the
shaded glow of the droplight she was sewing and the girl was drawing at
the same table From time to time as they talked the girl lifted her
head and tilted it a little on one side so as to get some desired effect
of her work

Its a mercy the cold weather holds off said the mother We should
have to light the furnace unless we wanted to scare everybody away with
a cold house and I dont know who would take care of it or what would
become of us every way

They seem to have been scared away from a house that wasnt cold said
the girl Perhaps they might like a cold one But its too early for
cold yet Its only just in the beginning of November

The Messenger says theyve had a sprinkling of snow

Oh yes at St Barnaby I dont know when they dont have sprinklings of
snow there Im awfully glad we havent got that winter before us

The widow sighed as mothers do who feel the contrast their experience
opposes to the hopeful recklessness of such talk as this We may have a
worse winter here she said darkly

Then I couldnt stand it said the girl and I should go in for
lighting out to Florida doublequick

And how would you get to Florida demanded her mother severely

Oh by the usual conveyance Pullman vestibuled train I suppose What
makes you so blue mamma The girl was all the time sketching away
rubbing out lifting her head for the effect and then bending it over
her work again without looking at her mother

I am not blue Alma But I cannot endure thisthis hopefulness of
yours

Why What harm does it do

Harm echoed the mother

Pending the effort she must make in saying the girl cut in Yes harm
Youve kept your despair dusted off and ready for use at an instants
notice ever since we came and what good has it done Im going to keep
on hoping to the bitter end Thats what papa did

It was what the Rev Archibald Leighton had done with all the
consumptives buoyancy The morning he died he told them that now he had
turned the point and was really going to get well The cheerfulness was
not only in his disease but in his temperament Its excess was always a
little against him in his church work and Mrs Leighton was right enough
in feeling that if it had not been for the ballast of her instinctive
despondency he would have made shipwreck of such small chances of
prosperity as befell him in life It was not from him that his daughter
got her talent though he had left her his temperament intact of his
widows legal thirds He was one of those men of whom the country people
say when he is gone that the woman gets along better without him Mrs
Leighton had long eked out their income by taking a summer boarder or
two as a great favor into her family and when the greater need came
she frankly gave up her house to the summerfolks as they call them in
the country and managed it for their comfort from the small quarter of
it in which she shut herself up with her daughter

The notion of shutting up is an exigency of the rounded period The fact
is of course that Alma Leighton was not shut up in any sense whatever
She was the pervading light if not force of the house She was a good
cook and she managed the kitchen with the help of an Irish girl while
her mother looked after the rest of the housekeeping But she was not
systematic she had inspiration but not discipline and her mother
mourned more over the days when Alma left the whole dinner to the Irish
girl than she rejoiced in those when one of Almas great thoughts took
form in a chickenpie of incomparable savor or in a matchless pudding
The offdays came when her artistic nature was expressing itself in
charcoal for she drew to the admiration of all among the lady boarders
who could not draw The others had their reserves they readily conceded
that Alma had genius but they were sure she needed instruction On the
other hand they were not so radical as to agree with the old painter who
came every summer to paint the elms of the St Barnaby meadows He
contended that she needed to be a man in order to amount to anything but
in this theory he was opposed by an authority of his own sex whom the
lady sketchers believed to speak with more impartiality in a matter
concerning them as much as Alma Leighton He said that instruction would
do and he was not only younger and handsomer but he was fresher from
the schools than old Harrington who even the lady sketchers could see
painted in an obsolescent manner His name was BeatonAngus Beaton but
he was not Scotch or not more Scotch than Mary Queen of Scots was His
father was a Scotchman but Beaton was born in Syracuse New York and it
had taken only three years in Paris to obliterate many traces of native
and ancestral manner in him He wore his black beard cut shorter than his
mustache and a little pointed he stood with his shoulders well thrown
back and with a lateral curve of his person when he talked about art
which would alone have carried conviction even if he had not had a thick
dark bang coming almost to the brows of his mobile gray eyes and had not
spoken English with quick staccato impulses so as to give it the effect
of epigrammatic and sententious French One of the ladies said that you
always thought of him as having spoken French after it was over and
accused herself of wrong in not being able to feel afraid of him None of
the ladies was afraid of him though they could not believe that he was
really so deferential to their work as he seemed and they knew when he
would not criticise Mr Harringtons work that he was just acting from
principle

They may or may not have known the deference with which he treated Almas
work but the girl herself felt that his abrupt impersonal comment
recognized her as a real sister in art He told her she ought to come to
New York and draw in the League or get into some painters private
class and it was the sense of duty thus appealed to which finally
resulted in the hazardous experiment she and her mother were now making
There were no logical breaks in the chain of their reasoning from past
success with boarders in St Barnaby to future success with boarders in
New York Of course the outlay was much greater The rent of the
furnished house they had taken was such that if they failed their
experiment would be little less than ruinous

But they were not going to fail that was what Alma contended with a
hardy courage that her mother sometimes felt almost invited failure if
it did not deserve it She was one of those people who believe that if
you dread harm enough it is less likely to happen She acted on this
superstition as if it were a religion

If it had not been for my despair as you call it Alma she answered
I dont know where we should have been now

I suppose we should have been in St Barnaby said the girl And if
its worse to be in New York you see what your despairs done mamma
But whats the use You meant well and I dont blame you You cant
expect even despair to come out always just the way you want it Perhaps
youve used too much of it The girl laughed and Mrs Leighton laughed
too Like every one else she was not merely a prevailing mood as people
are apt to be in books but was an irregularly spheroidal character with
surfaces that caught the different lights of circumstance and reflected
them Alma got up and took a pose before the mirror which she then
transferred to her sketch The room was pinned about with other sketches
which showed with fantastic indistinctness in the shaded gaslight Alma
held up the drawing How do you like it

Mrs Leighton bent forward over her sewing to look at it Youve got the
mans face rather weak

Yes thats so Either I see all the hidden weakness thats in mens
natures and bring it to the surface in their figures or else I put my
own weakness into them Either way its a drawback to their presenting a
truly manly appearance As long as I have one of the miserable objects
before me I can draw him but as soon as his backs turned I get to
putting ladies into mens clothes I should think youd be scandalized
mamma if you were a really feminine person It must be your despair that
helps you to bear up But whats the matter with the young lady in young
ladys clothes Any dust on her

What expressions said Mrs Leighton Really Alma for a refined girl
you are the most unrefined

Go onabout the girl in the picture said Alma slightly knocking her
mother on the shoulder as she stood over her

I dont see anything to her Whats she doing

Oh just being made love to I suppose

Shes perfectly insipid

Youre awfully articulate mamma Now if Mr Wetmore were to criticise
that picture hed draw a circle round it in the air and look at it
through that and tilt his head first on one side and then on the other
and then look at you as if you were a figure in it and then collapse
awhile and moan a little and gasp Isnt your young lady a little
tootoo and then hed try to get the word out of you and groan and
suffer some more and youd say She is rather and that would give
him courage and hed say I dont mean that shes so very Of course
not You understand Perfectly I see it myself now Well
thenand hed take your pencil and begin to drawI should give her a
little moreAh Yes I see the differenceYou see the difference
And hed go off to some one else and youd know that youd been doing
the wishywashiest thing in the world though he hadnt spoken a word of
criticism and couldnt But he wouldnt have noticed the expression at
all hed have shown you where your drawing was bad He doesnt care for
what he calls the literature of a thing he says that will take care of
itself if the drawings good He doesnt like my doing these chic things
but Im going to keep it up for I think its the nearest way to
illustrating

She took her sketch and pinned it up on the door

And has Mr Beaton been about yet asked her mother

No said the girl with her back still turned and she added I
believe hes in New York Mr Wetmores seen him

Its a little strange he doesnt call

It would be if he were not an artist But artists never do anything like
other people He was on his good behavior while he was with us and hes
a great deal more conventional than most of them but even he cant keep
it up Thats what makes me really think that women can never amount to
anything in art They keep all their appointments and fulfil all their
duties just as if they didnt know anything about art Well most of them
dont Weve got that new model today

What new model

The one Mr Wetmore was telling us about the old German hes splendid
Hes got the most beautiful head just like the old masters things He
used to be Humphrey Williamss model for his Biblicalpieces but since
hes dead the old man hardly gets anything to do Mr Wetmore says there
isnt anybody in the Bible that Williams didnt paint him as Hes the
Law and the Prophets in all his Old Testament pictures and hes Joseph
Peter Judas Iscariot and the Scribes and Pharisees in the New

Its a good thing people dont know how artists work or some of the
most sacred pictures would have no influence said Mrs Leighton

Why of course not cried the girl And the influence is the last
thing a painter thinks ofor supposes he thinks of What he knows hes
anxious about is the drawing and the color But people will never
understand how simple artists are When I reflect what a complex and
sophisticated being I am Im afraid I can never come to anything in art
Or I should be if I hadnt genius

Do you think Mr Beaton is very simple asked Mrs Leighton

Mr Wetmore doesnt think hes very much of an artist He thinks he
talks too well They believe that if a man can express himself clearly he
cant paint

And what do you believe

Oh I can express myself too

The mother seemed to be satisfied with this evasion After a while she
said I presume he will call when he gets settled

The girl made no answer to this One of the girls says that old model is
an educated man He was in the war and lost a hand Doesnt it seem a
pity for such a man to have to sit to a class of affected geese like us
as a model I declare it makes me sick And we shall keep him a week and
pay him six or seven dollars for the use of his grand old head and then
what will he do The last time he was regularly employed was when Mr
Mace was working at his Damascus Massacre Then he wanted so many Arab
sheiks and Christian elders that he kept old Mr Lindau steadily employed
for six months Now he has to pick up odd jobs where he can

I suppose he has his pension said Mrs Leighton

No one of the girlsthat was the way Alma always described her
fellowstudentssays he has no pension He didnt apply for it for a
long time and then there was a hitch about it and it was
somethingedvetoed I believe she said

Who vetoed it asked Mrs Leighton with some curiosity about the
process which she held in reserve

I dont knowwhoever vetoes things I wonder what Mr Wetmore does think
of ushis class We must seem perfectly crazy There isnt one of us
really knows what shes doing it for or what she expects to happen when
shes done it I suppose every one thinks she has genius I know the
Nebraska widow does for she says that unless you have genius it isnt
the least use Everybodys puzzled to know what she does with her baby
when shes at workwhether she gives it soothing syrup I wonder how Mr
Wetmore can keep from laughing in our faces I know he does behind our
backs

Mrs Leightons mind wandered back to another point Then if he says Mr
Beaton cant paint I presume he doesnt respect him very much

Oh he never said he couldnt paint But I know he thinks so He says
hes an excellent critic

Alma her mother said with the effect of breaking off what do you
suppose is the reason he hasnt been near us

Why I dont know mamma except that it would have been natural for
another person to come and hes an artist at least artist enough for
that

That doesnt account for it altogether He was very nice at St Barnaby
and seemed so interested in youyour work

Plenty of people were nice at St Barnaby That rich Mrs Horn couldnt
contain her joy when she heard we were coming to New York but she hasnt
poured in upon us a great deal since we got here

But thats different Shes very fashionable and shes taken up with
her own set But Mr Beatons one of our kind

Thank you Papa wasnt quite a tombstonecutter mamma

That makes it all the harder to bear He cant be ashamed of us Perhaps
he doesnt know where we are

Do you wish to send him your card mamma The girl flushed and towered
in scorn of the idea

Why no Alma returned her mother

Well then said Alma

But Mrs Leighton was not so easily quelled She had got her mind on Mr
Beaton and she could not detach it at once Besides she was one of
those women they are commoner than the same sort of men whom it does
not pain to take out their most intimate thoughts and examine them in the
light of other peoples opinions But I dont see how he can behave so
He must know that

That what mamma demanded the girl

That he influenced us a great deal in coming

He didnt If he dared to presume to think such a thing

Now Alma said her mother with the clinging persistence of such
natures you know he did And its no use for you to pretend that we
didnt count upon him inin every way You may not have noticed his
attentions and I dont say you did but others certainly did and I must
say that I didnt expect he would drop us so

Drop us cried Alma in a fury Oh

Yes drop us Alma He must know where we are Of course Mr Wetmores
spoken to him about you and its a shame that he hasnt been near us I
should have thought common gratitude common decency would have brought
him afterafter all we did for him

We did nothing for himnothing He paid his board and that ended it

No it didnt Alma You know what he used to sayabout its being like
home and all that and I must say that after his attentions to you and
all the things you told me he said I expected something very dif

A sharp peal of the doorbell thrilled through the house and as if the
pull of the bellwire had twitched her to her feet Mrs Leighton sprang
up and grappled with her daughter in their common terror

They both glared at the clock and made sure that it was five minutes
after nine Then they abandoned themselves some moments to the
unrestricted play of their apprehensions




II

Why Alma whispered the mother who in the world can it be at this
time of night You dont suppose he

Well Im not going to the door anyhow mother I dont care who it is
and of course he wouldnt be such a goose as to come at this hour She
put on a look of miserable trepidation and shrank back from the door
while the hum of the bell died away in the hall

What shall we do asked Mrs Leighton helplessly

Let him go awaywhoever they are said Alma

Another and more peremptory ring forbade them refuge in this simple
expedient

Oh dear what shall we do Perhaps its a despatch

The conjecture moved Alma to no more than a rigid stare I shall not
go she said A third ring more insistent than the others followed and
she said You go ahead mamma and Ill come behind to scream if its
anybody We can look through the sidelights at the door first

Mrs Leighton fearfully led the way from the back chamber where they bad
been sitting and slowly descended the stairs Alma came behind and
turned up the hall gasjet with a sudden flash that made them both jump a
little The gas inside rendered it more difficult to tell who was on the
threshold but Mrs Leighton decided from a timorous peep through the
scrims that it was a lady and gentleman Something in this distribution
of sex emboldened her she took her life in her hand and opened the
door

The lady spoke Does Mrs Leighton live heah she said in a rich
throaty voice and she feigned a reference to the agents permit she held
in her hand

Yes said Mrs Leighton she mechanically occupied the doorway while
Alma already quivered behind her with impatience of her impoliteness

Oh said the lady who began to appear more and more a young lady Ah
didnt know but Ah had mistaken the hoase Ah suppose its rather late to
see the apawtments and Ah most ask you to pawdon us She put this
tentatively with a delicately growing recognition of Mrs Leighton as
the lady of the house and a humorous intelligence of the situation in
the glance she threw Alma over her mothers shoulder Ahm afraid we
most have frightened you

Oh not at all said Alma and at the same time her mother said Will
you walk in please

The gentleman promptly removed his hat and made the Leightons an
inclusive bow You awe very kind madam and I am sorry for the trouble
we awe giving you He was tall and severelooking with a gray
trooperish mustache and irongray hair and as Alma decided irongray
eyes His daughter was short plump and freshcolored with an effect of
liveliness that did not all express itself in her broadvowelled rather
formal speech with its odd valuations of some of the auxiliary verbs
and its total elision of the canine letter

We awe from the Soath she said and we arrived this mawning but we
got this cyahd from the brokah just befo dinnah and so we awe rathah
late

Not at all its only nine oclock said Mrs Leighton She looked up
from the card the young lady had given her and explained We havent
got in our servants yet and we had to answer the bell ourselves and

You were frightened of coase said the young lady caressingly

The gentleman said they ought not to have come so late and he offered
some formal apologies

We should have been just as much scared any time after five oclock
Alma said to the sympathetic intelligence in the girls face

She laughed out Of coase Ah would have my hawt in my moath all day
long too if Ah was living in a big hoase alone

A moment of stiffness followed Mrs Leighton would have liked to
withdraw from the intimacy of the situation but she did not know how It
was very well for these people to assume to be what they pretended but
she reflected too late she had no proof of it except the agents permit
They were all standing in the hall together and she prolonged the
awkward pause while she examined the permit You are Mr Woodburn she
asked in a way that Alma felt implied he might not be

Yes madam from Charlottesboag Virginia he answered with the slight
umbrage a man shows when the strange cashier turns his check over and
questions him before cashing it

Alma writhed internally but outwardly remained subordinate she examined
the other girls dress and decided in a superficial consciousness that
she had made her own bonnet

I shall be glad to show you my rooms said Mrs Leighton with an
irrelevant sigh You must excuse their being not just as I should wish
them Were hardly settled yet

Dont speak of it madam said the gentleman if you can overlook the
trouble we awe giving you at such an unseasonable houah

Ahm a hoasekeepah mahself Miss Woodburn joined in and Ah know ho
to accyoant fo everything

Mrs Leighton led the way upstairs and the young lady decided upon the
large front room and small side room on the third story She said she
could take the small one and the other was so large that her father
could both sleep and work in it She seemed not ashamed to ask if Mrs
Leightons price was inflexible but gave way laughing when her father
refused to have any bargaining with a haughty selfrespect which he
softened to deference for Mrs Leighton His impulsiveness opened the way
for some confidence from her and before the affair was arranged she was
enjoying in her quality of clerical widow the balm of the Virginians
reverent sympathy They said they were church people themselves

Ah dont know what yo mothah means by yo hoase not being in oddah
the young lady said to Alma as they went downstairs together Ahm a
great hoasekeepah mahself and Ah mean what Ah say

They had all turned mechanically into the room where the Leightons were
sitting when the Woodburns rang Mr Woodburn consented to sit down and
he remained listening to Mrs Leighton while his daughter bustled up to
the sketches pinned round the room and questioned Alma about them

Ah suppose you awe going to be a great awtust she said in friendly
banter when Alma owned to having done the things Ahve a great notion
to take a few lessons mahself Whos yo teachah

Alma said she was drawing in Mr Wetmores class and Miss Woodburn said
Well its just beautiful Miss Leighton its grand Ah suppose its
raght expensive now Mah goodness we have to cyoant the coast so much
nowadays it seems to me we do nothing but cyoant it Ahd like to hah
something once without askin the price

Well if you didnt ask it said Alma I dont believe Mr Wetmore
would ever know what the price of his lessons was He has to think when
you ask him

Why he most be chomming said Miss Woodburn Perhaps Ah maght get the
lessons for nothing from him Well Ah believe in my soul Ahll trah Now
ho did you begin and ho do you expect to get anything oat of it She
turned on Alma eyes brimming with a shrewd mixture of fun and earnest
and Alma made note of the fact that she had an early nineteenthcentury
face round arch a little coquettish but extremely sensible and
unspoiledlooking such as used to be painted a good deal in miniature at
that period a tendency of her brown hair to twine and twist at the
temples helped the effect a high comb would have completed it Alma
felt if she had her bonnet off It was almost a Yankee countrygirl
type but perhaps it appeared so to Alma because it was like that pure
AngloSaxon Alma herself with her dull dark skin slender in figure
slow in speech with aristocratic forms in her long hands and the oval
of her fine face pointed to a long chin felt herself much more Southern
in style than this blooming bubbling bustling Virginian

I dont know she answered slowly

Going to take potraits suggested Miss Woodburn or just paint the
ahdeal A demure burlesque lurked in her tone

I suppose I dont expect to paint at all said Alma Im going to
illustrate booksif anybody will let me

Ah should think theyd just joamp at you said Miss Woodburn Ahll
tell you what lets do Miss Leighton you make some pictures and Ahll
wrahte a book fo them Ahve got to do something Ali maght as well
wrahte a book You know we Southerners have all had to go to woak But Ah
dont mand it I tell papa I shouldnt ca fo the disgrace of bein poo
if it wasnt fo the inconvenience

Yes its inconvenient said Alma but you forget it when youre at
work dont you think

Mah yes Perhaps thats one reason why poo people have to woak so
hawdto keep their wands off their poverty

The girls both tittered and turned from talking in a low tone with their
backs toward their elders and faced them

Well Madison said Mr Woodburn it is time we should go I bid you
goodnight madam he bowed to Mrs Leighton Goodnight he bowed
again to Alma

His daughter took leave of them in formal phrase but with a jolly
cordiality of manner that deformalized it We shall be roand raght soon
in the mawning then she threatened at the door

We shall be all ready for you Alma called after her down the steps

Well Alma her mother asked when the door closed upon them

She doesnt know any more about art said Alma thannothing at all
But shes jolly and goodhearted She praised everything that was bad in
my sketches and said she was going to take lessons herself When a
person talks about taking lessons as if they could learn it you know
where they belong artistically

Mrs Leighton shook her head with a sigh I wish I knew where they
belonged financially We shall have to get in two girls at once I shall
have to go out the first thing in the morning and then our troubles will
begin

Well didnt you want them to begin I will stay home and help you get
ready Our prosperity couldnt begin without the troubles if you mean
boarders and boarders mean servants I shall be very glad to be
afflicted with a cook for a while myself

Yes but we dont know anything about these people or whether they will
be able to pay us Did she talk as if they were well off

She talked as if they were poor poo she called it

Yes how queerly she pronounced said Mrs Leighton Well I ought to
have told them that I required the first week in advance

Mamma If thats the way youre going to act

Oh of course I couldnt after he wouldnt let her bargain for the
rooms I didnt like that

I did And you can see that they were perfect ladies or at least one of
them Alma laughed at herself but her mother did not notice

Their being ladies wont help if theyve got no money Itll make it
all the worse

Very well then we have no money either Were a match for them any
day there We can show them that two can play at that game




III

Arnus Beatons studio looked at first glance like many other painters
studios A gray wall quadrangularly vaulted to a large north light casts
of feet hands faces hung to nails about prints sketches in oil and
watercolor stuck here and there lower down a rickety table with paint
and palettes and bottles of varnish and siccative tossed comfortlessly on
it an easel with a strip of some faded mediaeval silk trailing from it
a lay figure simpering in incomplete nakedness with its head on one
side and a stocking on one leg and a Japanese dress dropped before it
dusty rugs and skins kicking over the varnished floor canvases faced to
the mopboard an open trunk overflowing with costumes these features
one might notice anywhere But besides there was a bookcase with an
unusual number of books in it and there was an open colonial
writingdesk clawfooted brasshandled and scutcheoned with foreign
periodicalsFrench and Englishlittering its leaf and some pages of
manuscript scattered among them Above all there was a sculptors
revolving stand supporting a bust which Beaton was modelling with an
eye fixed as simultaneously as possible on the clay and on the head of
the old man who sat on the platform beside it

Few men have been able to get through the world with several gifts to
advantage in all and most men seem handicapped for the race if they have
more than one But they are apparently immensely interested as well as
distracted by them When Beaton was writing he would have agreed up to
a certain point with any one who said literature was his proper
expression but then when he was painting up to a certain point he
would have maintained against the world that he was a colorist and
supremely a colorist At the certain point in either art he was apt to
break away in a frenzy of disgust and wreak himself upon some other In
these moods he sometimes designed elevations of buildings very striking
very original very chic very everything but habitable It was in this
way that he had tried his hand on sculpture which he had at first
approached rather slightingly as a mere decorative accessory of
architecture But it had grown in his respect till he maintained that the
accessory business ought to be all the other way that temples should be
raised to enshrine statues not statues made to ornament temples that
was putting the cart before the horse with a vengeance This was when he
had carried a plastic study so far that the sculptors who saw it said
that Beaton might have been an architect but would certainly never be a
sculptor At the same time he did some hurried nervous things that had a
popular charm and that sold in plaster reproductions to the profit of
another Beaton justly despised the popular charm in these as well as in
the paintings he sold from time to time he said it was flat burglary to
have taken money for them and he would have been living almost wholly
upon the bounty of the old tombstonecutter in Syracuse if it had not
been for the syndicate letters which he supplied to Fulkerson for ten
dollars a week

They were very well done but he hated doing them after the first two or
three and had to be punched up for them by Fulkerson who did not cease
to prize them and who never failed to punch him up Beaton being what he
was Fulkerson was his creditor as well as patron and Fulkerson being
what he was had an enthusiastic patience with the elusive facile
adaptable unpractical nature of Beaton He was very proud of his
artletters as he called them but then Fulkerson was proud of
everything he secured for his syndicate The fact that he had secured it
gave it value he felt as if he had written it himself

One art trod upon anothers heels with Beaton The day before he had
rushed upon canvas the conception of a picture which he said to himself
was glorious and to others at the table dhote of Maroni was not bad
He had worked at it in a fury till the light failed him and he execrated
the dying day But he lit his lamp and transferred the process of his
thinking from the canvas to the opening of the syndicate letter which he
knew Fulkerson would be coming for in the morning He remained talking so
long after dinner in the same strain as he had painted and written in
that he could not finish his letter that night The next morning while
he was making his tea for breakfast the postman brought him a letter
from his father enclosing a little check and begging him with tender
almost deferential urgence to come as lightly upon him as possible for
just now his expenses were very heavy It brought tears of shame into
Beatons eyesthe fine smouldering floating eyes that many ladies
admired under the thick bangand he said to himself that if he were
half a man he would go home and go to work cutting gravestones in his
fathers shop But he would wait at least to finish his picture and as
a sop to his conscience to stay its immediate ravening he resolved to
finish that syndicate letter first and borrow enough money from
Fulkerson to be able to send his fathers check back or if not that
then to return the sum of it partly in Fulkersons check While he still
teemed with both of these good intentions the old man from whom he was
modelling his head of Judas came and Beaton saw that he must get through
with him before he finished either the picture or the letter he would
have to pay him for the time anyway He utilized the remorse with which
he was tingling to give his Judas an expression which he found novel in
the treatment of that charactera look of such touching appealing
selfabhorrence that Beatons artistic joy in it amounted to rapture
between the breathless moments when he worked in dead silence for an
effect that was trying to escape him he sang and whistled fragments of
comic opera

In one of the hushes there came a blow on the outside of the door that
made Beaton jump and swear with a modified profanity that merged itself
in apostrophic prayer He knew it must be Fulkerson and after roaring
Come in he said to the model Thatll do this morning Lindau

Fulkerson squared his feet in front of the bust and compared it by
fleeting glances with the old man as he got stiffly up and suffered
Beaton to help him on with his thin shabby overcoat

Can you come tomorrow Lindau

No not tomorrow Mr Peaton I haf to zit for the young ladties

Oh said Beaton Wetmores class Is Miss Leighton doing you

I dont know their namess Lindau began when Fulkerson said

Hope you havent forgotten mine Mr Lindau I met you with Mr March at
Maronis one night Fulkerson offered him a universally shakable hand

Oh yes I am gladt to zee you again Mr Vulkerson And Mr Margehe
dont zeem to gome any more

Up to his eyes in work Been moving on from Boston and getting settled
and starting in on our enterprise Beaton here hasnt got a very
flattering likeness of you hey Well goodmorning he said for Lindau
appeared not to have heard him and was escaping with a bow through the
door

Beaton lit a cigarette which he pinched nervously between his lips before
he spoke Youve come for that letter I suppose Fulkerson It isnt
done

Fulkerson turned from staring at the bust to which he had mounted What
you fretting about that letter for I dont want your letter

Beaton stopped biting his cigarette and looked at him Dont want my
letter Oh very good he bristled up He took his cigarette from his
lips and blew the smoke through his nostrils and then looked at
Fulkerson

No I dont want your letter I want you

Beacon disdained to ask an explanation but he internally lowered his
crest while he continued to look at Fulkerson without changing his
defiant countenance This suited Fulkerson well enough and he went on
with relish Im going out of the syndicate business old man and Im
on a new thing He put his leg over the back of a chair and rested his
foot on its seat and with one hand in his pocket he laid the scheme of
Every Other Week before Beaton with the help of the other The artist
went about the room meanwhile with an effect of indifference which by
no means offended Fulkerson He took some water into his mouth from a
tumbler which he blew in a fine mist over the head of Judas before
swathing it in a dirty cotton cloth he washed his brushes and set his
palette he put up on his easel the picture he had blocked on the day
before and stared at it with a gloomy face then he gathered the sheets
of his unfinished letter together and slid them into a drawer of his
writingdesk By the time he had finished and turned again to Fulkerson
Fulkerson was saying I did think we could have the first number out by
NewYears but it will take longer than thata month longer but Im
not sorry for the holidays kill everything and by February or the
middle of February people will get their breath again and begin to look
round and ask whats new Then well reply in the language of Shakespeare
and Milton Every Other Week and dont you forget it He took down
his leg and asked Got a pipe of baccy anywhere

Beaton nodded at a clay stem sticking out of a Japanese vase of bronze on
his mantel Theres yours he said and Fulkerson said Thanks and
filled the pipe and sat down and began to smoke tranquilly

Beaton saw that he would have to speak now And what do you want with
me

You Oh yes Fulkerson humorously dramatized a return to himself from a
pensive absence Want you for the art department

Beaton shook his head Im not your man Fulkerson he said
compassionately You want a more practical hand one thats in touch
with whats going Im getting further and further away from this century
and its claptrap I dont believe in your enterprise I dont respect it
and I wont have anything to do with it It wouldchoke me that kind of
thing

Thats all right said Fulkerson He esteemed a man who was not going
to let himself go cheap Or if it isnt we can make it You and March
will pull together firstrate I dont care how much ideal you put into
the thing the more the better I can look after the other end of the
schooner myself

You dont understand me said Beaton Im not trying to get a rise out
of you Im in earnest What you want is some man who can have patience
with mediocrity putting on the style of genius and with genius turning
mediocrity on his hands I havent any luck with men I dont get on with
them Im not popular Beaton recognized the fact with the satisfaction
which it somehow always brings to human pride

So much the better Fulkerson was ready for him at this point I dont
want you to work the oldestablished racket the reputations When I want
them Ill go to them with a pocketful of rocksknockdown argument But
my idea is to deal with the volunteer material Look at the way the
periodicals are carried on now Names names names In a country thats
just boiling over with literary and artistic ability of every kind the
new fellows have no chance The editors all engage their material I
dont believe there are fifty volunteer contributions printed in a year
in all the New York magazines Its all wrong its suicidal Every
Other Week is going back to the good old anonymous system the only fair
system Its worked well in literature and it will work well in art

It wont work well in art said Beaton There you have a totally
different set of conditions What youll get by inviting volunteer
illustrations will be a lot of amateur trash And how are you going to
submit your literature for illustration It cant be done At any rate I
wont undertake to do it

Well get up a School of Illustration said Fulkerson with cynical
security You can read the things and explain em and your pupils can
make their sketches under your eye They wouldnt be much further out
than most illustrations are if they never knew what they were
illustrating You might select from what comes in and make up a sort of
pictorial variations to the literature without any particular reference
to it Well I understand you to accept

No you dont

That is to consent to help us with your advice and criticism Thats
all I want It wont commit you to anything and you can be as anonymous
as anybody At the door Fulkerson added Bytheway the new manthe
fellow thats taken my old syndicate businesswill want you to keep on
but I guess hes going to try to beat you down on the price of the
letters Hes going in for retrenchment I brought along a check for this
one Im to pay for that He offered Beaton an envelope

I cant take it Fulkerson The letters paid for already Fulkerson
stepped forward and laid the envelope on the table among the tubes of
paint

It isnt the letter merely I thought you wouldnt object to a little
advance on your Every Other Week work till you kind of got started

Beaton remained inflexible It cant be done Fulkerson Dont I tell
you I cant sell myself out to a thing I dont believe in Cant you
understand that

Oh yes I can understand that firstrate I dont want to buy you I
want to borrow you Its all right See Come round when you can Id
like to introduce you to old March Thats going to be our address He
put a card on the table beside the envelope and Beaton allowed him to go
without making him take the check back He had remembered his fathers
plea that unnerved him and he promised himself again to return his
fathers poor little check and to work on that picture and give it to
Fulkerson for the check he had left and for his back debts He resolved
to go to work on the picture at once he had set his palette for it but
first he looked at Fulkersons check It was for only fifty dollars and
the canny Scotch blood in Beaton rebelled he could not let this picture
go for any such money he felt a little like a man whose generosity has
been trifled with The conflict of emotions broke him up and he could
not work




IV

The day wasted away in Beatons hands at halfpast four oclock he went
out to tea at the house of a lady who was At Home that afternoon from
four till seven By this time Beaton was in possession of one of those
other selves of which we each have several about us and was again the
laconic staccato rather worldlified young artist whose moments of a
controlled utterance and a certain distinction of manner had commended
him to Mrs Horns fancy in the summer at St Barnaby

Mrs Horns rooms were large and they never seemed very full though
this perhaps was because people were always so quiet The ladies who
outnumbered the men ten to one as they always do at a New York tea were
dressed in sympathy with the low tone every one spoke in and with the
subdued light which gave a crepuscular uncertainty to the few objects
the dim pictures the unexcited upholstery of the rooms One breathed
free of bricabrac there and the newcomer breathed softly as one does
on going into church after service has begun This might be a suggestion
from the voiceless behavior of the manservant who let you in but it was
also because Mrs Horns At Home was a ceremony a decorum and not
festival At far greater houses there was more gayety at richer houses
there was more freedom the suppression at Mrs Horns was a personal
not a social effect it was an efflux of her character demure
silentious vague but very correct

Beaton easily found his way to her around the grouped skirts and among
the detached figures and received a pressure of welcome from the hand
which she momentarily relaxed from the teapot She sat behind a table
put crosswise of a remote corner and offered tea to people whom a niece
of hers received provisionally or sped finally in the outer room They
did not usually take tea and when they did they did not usually drink
it but Beaton was feverishly glad of his cup he took rum and lemon in
it and stood talking at Mrs Horns side till the next arrival should
displace him he talked in his French manner

I have been hoping to see you she said I wanted to ask you about the
Leightons Did they really come

I believe so They are in townyes I havent seen them

Then you dont know how theyre getting onthat pretty creature with
her cleverness and poor Mrs Leighton I was afraid they were venturing
on a rash experiment Do you know where they are

In West Eleventh Street somewhere Miss Leighton is in Mr Wetmores
class

I must look them up Do you know their number

Not at the moment I can find out

Do said Mrs Horn What courage they must have to plunge into New
York as theyve done I really didnt think they would I wonder if
theyve succeeded in getting anybody into their house yet

I dont know said Beaton

I discouraged their coming all I could she sighed and I suppose you
did too But its quite useless trying to make people in a place like
St Barnaby understand how it is in town

Yes said Beaton He stirred his tea while inwardly he tried to
believe that he had really discouraged the Leightons from coming to New
York Perhaps the vexation of his failure made him call Mrs Horn in his
heart a fraud

Yes she went on it is very very hard And when they wont
understand and rush on their doom you feel that they are going to hold
you respons

Mrs Horns eyes wandered from Beaton her voice faltered in the faded
interest of her remark and then rose with renewed vigor in greeting a
lady who came up and stretched her glove across the teacups

Beaton got himself away and out of the house with a much briefer adieu to
the niece than he had meant to make The patronizing compassion of Mrs
Horn for the Leightons filled him with indignation toward her toward
himself There was no reason why he should not have ignored them as he
had done but there was a feeling It was his nature to be careless and
he had been spoiled into recklessness he neglected everybody and only
remembered them when it suited his whim or his convenience but he
fiercely resented the inattentions of others toward himself He had no
scruple about breaking an engagement or failing to keep an appointment
he made promises without thinking of their fulfilment and not because he
was a faithless person but because he was imaginative and expected at
the time to do what he said but was fickle and so did not As most of
his shortcomings were of a society sort no great harm was done to
anybody else He had contracted somewhat the circle of his acquaintance
by what some people called his rudeness but most people treated it as
his oddity and were patient with it One lady said she valued his coming
when he said he would come because it had the charm of the unexpected
Only it shows that it isnt always the unexpected that happens she
explained

It did not occur to him that his behavior was immoral he did not realize
that it was creating a reputation if not a character for him While we
are still young we do not realize that our actions have this effect It
seems to us that people will judge us from what we think and feel Later
we find out that this is impossible perhaps we find it out too late
some of us never find it out at all

In spite of his shame about the Leightons Beaton had no present
intention of looking them up or sending Mrs Horn their address As a
matter of fact he never did send it but he happened to meet Mr Wetmore
and his wife at the restaurant where he dined and he got it of the
painter for himself He did not ask him how Miss Leighton was getting on
but Wetmore launched out with Alma for a tacit text on the futility of
women generally going in for art Even when they have talent theyve got
too much against them Where a girl doesnt seem very strong like Miss
Leighton no amount of chic is going to help

His wife disputed him on behalf of her sex as women always do

No Dolly he persisted shed better be home milking the cows and
leading the horse to water

Do you think shed better be up till two in the morning at balls and
going all day to receptions and luncheons

Oh guess it isnt a question of that even if she werent drawing You
knew them at home he said to Beaton

Yes

I remember Her mother said you suggested me Well the girl has some
notion of it theres no doubt about that Butshes a woman The
trouble with these talented girls is that theyre all woman If they
werent there wouldnt be much chance for the men Beaton But weve got
Providence on our own side from the start Im able to watch all their
inspirations with perfect composure I know just how soon its going to
end in nervous breakdown Somebody ought to marry them all and put them
out of their misery

And what will you do with your students who are married already his
wife said She felt that she had let him go on long enough

Oh they ought to get divorced

You ought to be ashamed to take their money if thats what you think of
them

My dear I have a wife to support

Beaton intervened with a question Do you mean that Miss Leighton isnt
standing it very well

How do I know She isnt the kind that bends shes the kind that
breaks

After a little silence Mrs Wetmore asked Wont you come home with us
Mr Beaton

Thank you no I have an engagement

I dont see why that should prevent you said Wetmore But you always
were a punctilious cuss Well

Beaton lingered over his cigar but no one else whom he knew came in and
he yielded to the threefold impulse of conscience of curiosity of
inclination in going to call at the Leightons He asked for the ladies
and the maid showed him into the parlor where he found Mrs Leighton and
Miss Woodburn

The widow met him with a welcome neatly marked by resentment she meant
him to feel that his not coming sooner had been noticed Miss Woodburn
bubbled and gurgled on and did what she could to mitigate his
punishment but she did not feel authorized to stay it till Mrs
Leighton by studied avoidance of her daughters name obliged Beaton to
ask for her Then Miss Woodburn caught up her work and said Ahll go
and tell her Mrs Leighton At the top of the stairs she found Alma
and Alma tried to make it seem as if she had not been standing there
Mah goodness chald theres the handsomest young man asking for you
down there you evah saw Alh told you mothah Ah would come up fo you

Whatwho is it

Dont you know But bo could you Hes got the most beautiful eyes
and he weas his hai in a bang and he talks English like it was
something else and his names Mr Beaton

Did heask for me said Alma with a dreamy tone She put her hand on
the stairs rail and a little shiver ran over her

Didnt I tell you Of coase he did And you ought to go raght down if
you want to save the poo fellahs lahfe you mothahs just freezin him
to death




V

She is cried Alma Tchk She flew downstairs and flitted swiftly
into the room and fluttered up to Beaton and gave him a crushing
handshake

How very kind of you to come and see us Mr Beaton When did you come
to New York Dont you find it warm here Weve only just lighted the
furnace but with this mild weather it seems too early Mamma does keep
it so hot She rushed about opening doors and shutting registers and
then came back and sat facing him from the sofa with a mask of radiant
cordiality How have you been since we saw you

Very well said Beaton I hope youre well Miss Leighton

Oh perfectly I think New York agrees with us both wonderfully I never
knew such air And to think of our not having snow yet I should think
everybody would want to come here Why dont you come Mr Beaton

Beaton lifted his eyes and looked at her II live in New York he
faltered

In New York City she exclaimed

Surely Alma said her mother you remember Mr Beatons telling us he
lived in New York

But I thought you came from Rochester or was it Syracuse I always get
those places mixed up

Probably I told you my father lived at Syracuse Ive been in New York
ever since I came home from Paris said Beaton with the confusion of a
man who feels himself played upon by a woman

From Paris Alma echoed leaning forward with her smiling mask tight
on Wasnt it Munich where you studied

I was at Munich too I met Wetmore there

Oh do you know Mr Wetmore

Why Alma her mother interposed again it was Mr Beaton who told you
of Mr Wetmore

Was it Why yes to be sure It was Mrs Horn who suggested Mr Ilcomb
I remember now I cant thank you enough for having sent me to Mr
Wetmore Mr Beaton Isnt he delightful Oh yes Im a perfect
Wetmorian I can assure you The whole class is the same way

I just met him and Mrs Wetmore at dinner said Beaton attempting the
recovery of something that he had lost through the girls shining ease
and steely sprightliness She seemed to him so smooth and hard with a
repellent elasticity from which he was flung off I hope youre not
working too hard Miss Leighton

Oh no I enjoy every minute of it and grow stronger on it Do I look
very much wasted away She looked him full in the face brilliantly
smiling and intentionally beautiful

No he said with a slow sadness I never saw you looking better

Poor Mr Beaton she said in recognition of his doleful tune It
seems to be quite a blow

Oh no

I remember all the good advice you used to give me about not working too
hard and probably its that thats saved my lifethat and the
househunting Has mamma told you of our adventures in getting settled

Some time we must It was such fun And didnt you think we were
fortunate to get such a pretty house You must see both our parlors She
jumped up and her mother followed her with a bewildered look as she ran
into the back parlor and flashed up the gas

Come in here Mr Beaton I want to show you the great feature of the
house She opened the low windows that gave upon a glazed veranda
stretching across the end of the room Just think of this in New York
You cant see it very well at night but when the southern sun pours in
here all the afternoon

Yes I can imagine it he said He glanced up at the birdcage hanging
from the roof I suppose Gypsy enjoys it

You remember Gypsy she said and she made a cooing kissing little
noise up at the bird who responded drowsily Poor old Gypsum Well he
shant be disturbed Yes its Gyps delight and Colonel Woodburn likes
to write here in the morning Think of us having a real live author in
the house And Miss Woodburn Im so glad youve seen her Theyre
Southern people

Yes that was obvious in her case

From her accent Isnt it fascinating I didnt believe I could ever
endure Southerners but were like one family with the Woodburns I
should think youd want to paint Miss Woodburn Dont you think her
coloring is delicious And such a quaint kind of eighteenthcentury type
of beauty But shes perfectly lovely every way and everything she says
is so funny The Southerners seem to be such great talkers better than
we are dont you think

I dont know said Beaton in pensive discouragement He was sensible
of being manipulated operated but he was helpless to escape from the
performer or to fathom her motives His pensiveness passed into gloom
and was degenerating into sulky resentment when he went away after
several failures to get back to the old ground he had held in relation to
Alma He retrieved something of it with Mrs Leighton but Alma glittered
upon him to the last with a keen impenetrable candor a childlike
singleness of glance covering unfathomable reserve

Well Alma said her mother when the door had closed upon him

Well mother Then after a moment she said with a rush Did you
think I was going to let him suppose we were piqued at his not coming
Did you suppose I was going to let him patronize us or think that we
were in the least dependent on his favor or friendship

Her mother did not attempt to answer her She merely said I shouldnt
think he would come any more

Well we have got on so far without him perhaps we can live through the
rest of the winter

I couldnt help feeling sorry for him He was quite stupefied I could
see that he didnt know what to make of you

Hes not required to make anything of me said Alma

Do you think he really believed you had forgotten all those things

Impossible to say mamma

Well I dont think it was quite right Alma

Ill leave him to you the next time Miss Woodburn said you were
freezing him to death when I came down

That was quite different But there wont be any next time Im
afraid sighed Mrs Leighton

Beaton went home feeling sure there would not He tried to read when he
got to his room but Almas looks tones gestures whirred through and
through the woof of the story like shuttles he could not keep them out
and he fell asleep at last not because he forgot them but because he
forgave them He was able to say to himself that he had been justly cut
off from kindness which he knew how to value in losing it He did not
expect ever to right himself in Almas esteem but he hoped some day to
let her know that he had understood It seemed to him that it would be a
good thing if she should find it out after his death He imagined her
being touched by it under those circumstances




VI

In the morning it seemed to Beaton that he had done himself injustice
When he uncovered his Judas and looked at it he could not believe that
the man who was capable of such work deserved the punishment Miss
Leighton had inflicted upon him He still forgave her but in the
presence of a thing like that he could not help respecting himself he
believed that if she could see it she would be sorry that she had cut
herself off from his acquaintance He carried this strain of conviction
all through his syndicate letter which he now took out of his desk and
finished with an increasing security of his opinions and a mounting
severity in his judgments He retaliated upon the general condition of
art among us the pangs of wounded vanity which Alma had made him feel
and he folded up his manuscript and put it in his pocket almost healed
of his humiliation He had been able to escape from its sting so entirely
while he was writing that the notion of making his life more and more
literary commended itself to him As it was now evident that the future
was to be one of renunciation of selfforgetting an oblivion tinged
with bitterness he formlessly reasoned in favor of reconsidering his
resolution against Fulkersons offer One must call it reasoning but it
was rather that swift internal dramatization which constantly goes on in
persons of excitable sensibilities and which now seemed to sweep Beaton
physically along toward the Every Other Week office and carried his
mind with lightning celerity on to a time when he should have given that
journal such quality and authority in matters of art as had never been
enjoyed by any in America before With the prosperity which he made
attend his work he changed the character of the enterprise and with
Fulkersons enthusiastic support he gave the public an art journal of as
high grade as Les Lettres et les Arts and very much that sort of
thing All this involved now the unavailing regret of Alma Leighton and
now his reconciliation with her they were married in Grace Church
because Beaton had once seen a marriage there and had intended to paint
a picture of it some time

Nothing in these fervid fantasies prevented his responding with due
dryness to Fulkersons cheery Hello old man when he found himself in
the building fitted up for the Every Other Week office Fulkersons
room was back of the smaller one occupied by the bookkeeper they had
been respectively the receptionroom and diningroom of the little place
in its dwellinghouse days and they had been simply and tastefully
treated in their transformation into business purposes The narrow old
trim of the doors and windows had been kept and the quaintly ugly marble
mantels The architect had said Better let them stay they expressed
epoch if not character

Well have you come round to go to work Just hang up your coat on the
floor anywhere Fulkerson went on

Ive come to bring you that letter said Beaton all the more haughtily
because he found that Fulkerson was not alone when he welcomed him in
these free and easy terms There was a quietlooking man rather stout
and a little above the middle height with a full closecropped
irongray beard seated beyond the table where Fulkerson tilted himself
back with his knees set against it and leaning against the mantel there
was a young man with a singularly gentle face in which the look of
goodness qualified and transfigured a certain simplicity His large blue
eyes were somewhat prominent and his rather narrow face was drawn
forward in a nose a little too long perhaps if it had not been for the
full chin deeply cut below the lip and jutting firmly forward

Introduce you to Mr March our editor Mr Beaton Fulkerson said
rolling his head in the direction of the elder man and then nodding it
toward the younger he said Mr Dryfoos Mr Beaton Beaton shook
hands with March and then with Mr Dryfoos and Fulkerson went on
gayly We were just talking of you Beatonwell you know the old
saying Mr March as I told you is our editor and Mr Dryfoos has
charge of the publishing departmenthes the countingroom incarnate
the source of power the fountain of corruption the element that
prevents journalism being the high and holy thing that it would be if
there were no money in it Mr Dryfoos turned his large mild eyes upon
Beaton and laughed with the uneasy concession which people make to a
character when they do not quite approve of the characters language
What Mr March and I are trying to do is to carry on this thing so that
there wont be any money in itor very little and were planning to
give the public a better article for the price than its ever had before
Now heres a dummy weve had made up for Every Other Week and as weve
decided to adopt it we would naturally like your opinion of it sos to
know what opinion to have of you He reached forward and pushed toward
Beaton a volume a little above the size of the ordinary duodecimo book
its ivorywhite pebbled paper cover was prettily illustrated with a
watercolored design irregularly washed over the greater part of its
surface quite across the page at top and narrowing from right to left
as it descended In the triangular space left blank the title of the
periodical and the publishers imprint were tastefully lettered so as to
be partly covered by the background of color

Its like some of those Tartarin books of Daudets said Beacon
looking at it with more interest than he suffered to be seen But its a
book not a magazine He opened its pages of thick mellow white paper
with uncut leaves the first few pages experimentally printed in the type
intended to be used and illustrated with some sketches drawn into and
over the text for the sake of the effect

A Daniela Daniel come to judgment Sit down Danel and take it
easy Fulkerson pushed a chair toward Beaton who dropped into it
Youre right Danel its a book to all practical intents and
purposes And what we propose to do with the American public is to give
it twentyfour books like this a yeara complete libraryfor the absurd
sum of six dollars We dont intend to sell emits no name for the
transactionbut to give em And what we want to get out of youbeg
borrow buy or steal from you is an opinion whether we shall make the
American public this princely present in paper covers like this or in
some sort of flexible boards so they can set them on the shelf and say
no more about it Now Danel come to judgment as our respected friend
Shylock remarked

Beacon had got done looking at the dummy and he dropped it on the table
before Fulkerson who pushed it away apparently to free himself from
partiality I dont know anything about the business side and I cant
tell about the effect of either style on the sales but youll spoil the
whole character of the cover if you use anything thicker than that
thickish paper

All right very good firstrate The ayes have it Paper it is I dont
mind telling you that we had decided for that paper before you came in
Mr March wanted it because he felt in his bones just the way you do
about it and Mr Dryfoos wanted it because hes the countingroom
incarnate and its cheaper and I wanted it because I always like to
go with the majority Now what do you think of that little design
itself

The sketch Beaton pulled the book toward him again and looked at it
again Rather decorative Drawings not remarkable Graceful rather
nice He pushed the book away again and Fulkerson pulled it to his aide
of the table

Well thats a piece of that amateur trash you despise so much I went
to a painter I knowbytheway he was guilty of suggesting you for this
thing but I told him I was ahead of himand I got him to submit my idea
to one of his class and thats the result Well now there aint
anything in this world that sells a book like a pretty cover and were
going to have a pretty cover for Every Other Week every time Weve cut
loose from the old traditional quarto literary newspaper size and weve
cut loose from the old twocolumn big page magazine size were going to
have a duodecimo page clear black print and paper thatll make your
mouth water and were going to have a fresh illustration for the cover
of each number and we aint agoing to give the public any rest at all
Sometimes were going to have a delicate little landscape like this and
sometimes were going to have an indelicate little figure or as much so
as the law will allow

The young man leaning against the mantelpiece blushed a sort of protest

March smiled and said dryly Those are the numbers that Mr Fulkerson
is going to edit himself

Exactly And Mr Beaton here is going to supply the floating females
gracefully airing themselves against a sunset or something of that kind
Beaton frowned in embarrassment while Fulkerson went on philosophically
Its astonishing how you fellows can keep it up at this stage of the
proceedings you can paint things that your harshest critic would be
ashamed to describe accurately youre as free as the theatre But thats
neither here nor there What Im after is the fact that were going to
have variety in our titlepages and we are going to have novelty in the
illustrations of the body of the book March here if he had his own
way wouldnt have any illustrations at all

Not because I dont like them Mr Beacon March interposed but
because I like them too much I find that I look at the pictures in an
illustrated article but I dont read the article very much and I fancy
thats the case with most other people Youve got to doing them so
prettily that you take our eyes off the literature if you dont take our
minds off

Like the society beauties on the stage people go in for the beauty so
much that they dont know what the play is But the boxoffice gets there
all the same and thats what Mr Dryfoos wants Fulkerson looked up
gayly at Mr Dryfoos who smiled deprecatingly

It was different March went on when the illustrations used to be
bad Then the text had some chance

Old legitimate drama days when ugliness and genius combined to storm
the galleries said Fulkerson

We can still make them bad enough said Beaton ignoring Fulkerson in
his remark to March

Fulkerson took the reply upon himself Well you neednt make em so bad
as the oldstyle cuts but you can make them unobtrusive modestly
retiring Weve got hold of a process something like that those French
fellows gave Daudet thirtyfive thousand dollars to write a novel to use
with kind of thing that begins at one side or one corner and spreads
in a sort of dim religious style over the print till you cant tell which
is which Then weve got a notion that where the pictures dont behave
quite so sociably they can be dropped into the text like a little
casual remark dont you know or a comment that has some connection or
maybe none at all with whats going on in the story Something like
this Fulkerson took away one knee from the table long enough to open
the drawer and pull from it a book that he shoved toward Beacon Thats
a Spanish book I happened to see at Brentanos and I froze to it on
account of the pictures I guess theyre pretty good

Do you expect to get such drawings in this country asked Beaton after
a glance at the book Such charactersuch drama You wont

Well Im not so sure said Fulkerson come to get our amateurs warmed
up to the work But what I want is to get the physical effect so to
speakget that sized picture into our page and set the fashion of it I
shouldnt care if the illustration was sometimes confined to an initial
letter and a tailpiece

Couldnt be done here We havent the touch Were good in some things
but this isnt in our way said Beaton stubbornly I cant think of a
man who could do it that is among those that would

Well think of some woman then said Fulkerson easily Ive got a
notion that the women could help us out on this thing come to get em
interested There aint anything so popular as female fiction why not
try female art

The females themselves have been supposed to have been trying it for a
good while March suggested and Mr Dryfoos laughed nervously Beaton
remained solemnly silent

Yes I know Fulkerson assented But I dont mean that kind exactly
What we want to do is to work the ewig Weibliche in this concern We
want to make a magazine that will go for the womens fancy every time I
dont mean with recipes for cooking and fashions and personal gossip
about authors and society but real hightone literature that will show
women triumphing in all the stories or else suffering tremendously
Weve got to recognize that women form threefourths of the reading
public in this country and go for their tastes and their sensibilities
and their sexpiety along the whole line They do like to think that
women can do things better than men and if we can let it leak out and
get around in the papers that the managers of Every Other Week couldnt
stir a peg in the line of the illustrations they wanted till they got a
lot of Godgifted girls to help them it ll make the fortune of the
thing See

He looked sunnily round at the other men and March said You ought to
be in charge of a Siamese white elephant Fulkerson Its a disgrace to
be connected with you

It seems to me said Becton that youd better get a Godgifted girl
for your art editor

Fulkerson leaned alertly forward and touched him on the shoulder with a
compassionate smile My dear boy they havent got the genius of
organization It takes a very masculine man for thata man who combines
the most subtle and refined sympathies with the most forceful purposes
and the most ferruginous willpower Which his name is Angus Beaton and
here he sets

The others laughed with Fulkerson at his gross burlesque of flattery and
Becton frowned sheepishly I suppose you understand this mans style
he growled toward March

He does my son said Fulkerson He knows that I cannot tell a lie
He pulled out his watch and then got suddenly upon his feet

Its quarter of twelve and Ive got an appointment Beaton rose too
and Fulkerson put the two books in his lax hands Take these along
Michelangelo Da Vinci my friend and put your multitudinous mind on them
for about an hour and let us hear from you tomorrow We hang upon your
decision

Theres no deciding to be done said Beaton You cant combine the two
styles Theyd kill each other

A Danel a Danel come to judgment I knew you could help us out Take
em along and tell us which will go the furthest with the ewig
Weibliche Dryfoos I want a word with you He led the way into the
front room flirting an airy farewell to Beaton with his hand as he went




VII

March and Beaton remained alone together for a moment and March said I
hope you will think it worth while to take hold with us Mr Beaton Mr
Fulkerson puts it in his own way of course but we really want to make a
nice thing of the magazine He had that timidity of the elder in the
presence of the younger man which the younger preoccupied with his own
timidity in the presence of the elder cannot imagine Besides March was
aware of the gulf that divided him as a literary man from Beaton as an
artist and he only ventured to feel his way toward sympathy with him
We want to make it good we want to make it high Fulkerson is right
about aiming to please the women but of course he caricatures the way of
going about it

For answer Beaton flung out I cant go in for a thing I dont
understand the plan of

March took it for granted that he had wounded some exposed sensibility
of Beatons He continued still more deferentially Mr Fulkersons
notionI must say the notion is his evolved from his syndicate
experienceis that we shall do best in fiction to confine ourselves to
short stories and make each number complete in itself He found that the
most successful things he could furnish his newspapers were short
stories we Americans are supposed to excel in writing them and most
people begin with them in fiction and its Mr Fulkersons idea to work
unknown talent as he says and so he thinks he can not only get them
easily but can gradually form a school of shortstory writers I cant
say I follow him altogether but I respect his experience We shall not
despise translations of short stories but otherwise the matter will all
be original and of course it wont all be short stories We shall use
sketches of travel and essays and little dramatic studies and bits of
biography and history but all very light and always short enough to be
completed in a single number Mr Fulkerson believes in pictures and
most of the things would be capable of illustration

I see said Beaton

I dont know but this is the whole affair said March beginning to
stiffen a little at the young mans reticence

I understand Thank you for taking the trouble to explain
Goodmorning Beaton bowed himself off without offering to shake hands

Fulkerson came in after a while from the outer office and Mr Dryfoos
followed him Well what do you think of our art editor

Is he our art editor asked March I wasnt quite certain when he
left

Did he take the books

Yes he took the books

I guess hes all right then Fulkerson added in concession to the
umbrage he detected in March

Beaton has his times of being the greatest ass in the solar system but
he usually takes it out in personal conduct When it comes to work hes
a regular horse

He appears to have compromised for the present by being a perfect mule
said March

Well hes in a transition state Fulkerson allowed Hes the man for
us He really understands what we want Youll see hell catch on That
lurid glare of his will wear off in the course of time Hes really a
good fellow when you take him off his guard and hes full of ideas Hes
spread out over a good deal of ground at present and so hes pretty
thin but come to gather him up into a lump theres a good deal of
substance to him Yes there is Hes a firstrate critic and hes a
nice fellow with the other artists They laugh at his universality but
they all like him Hes the best kind of a teacher when he condescends to
it and hes just the man to deal with our volunteer work Yes sir hes
a prize Well I must go now

Fulkerson went out of the street door and then came quickly back
Bythebye March I saw that old dynamiter of yours round at Beatons
room yesterday

What old dynamiter of mine

That old onehanded Dutchmanfriend of your youththe one we saw at
Maronis

OhLindau said March with a vague pang of self reproach for having
thought of Lindau so little after the first flood of his tender feeling
toward him was past

Yes our versatile friend was modelling him as Judas Iscariot Lindau
makes a firstrate Judas and Beaton has got a big thing in that head if
he works the religious people right But what I was thinking of was
thisit struck me just as I was going out of the door Didnt you tell
me Lindau knew forty or fifty different languages

Four or five yes

Well we wont quarrel about the number The question is Why not work
him in the field of foreign literature You cant go over all their
reviews and magazines and he could do the smelling for you if you could
trust his nose Would he know a good thing

I think he would said March on whom the scope of Fulkersons
suggestion gradually opened He used to have good taste and he must
know the ground Why its a capital idea Fulkerson Lindau wrote very
fair English and he could translate with a little revision

And he would probably work cheap Well hadnt you better see him about
it I guess it ll be quite a windfall for him

Yes it will Ill look him up Thank you for the suggestion
Fulkerson

Oh dont mention it I dont mind doing Every Other Week a good turn
now and then when it comes in my way Fulkerson went out again and this
time March was finally left with Mr Dryfoos

Mrs March was very sorry not to be at home when your sisters called the
other day She wished me to ask if they had any afternoon in particular
There was none on your mothers card

No sir said the young man with a flush of embarrassment that seemed
habitual with him She has no day Shes at home almost every day She
hardly ever goes out

Might we come some evening March asked We should be very glad to do
that if she would excuse the informality Then I could come with Mrs
March

Mother isnt very formal said the young man She would be very glad
to see you

Then well come some night this week if you will let us When do you
expect your father back

Not much before Christmas Hes trying to settle up some things at
Moffitt

And what do you think of our art editor asked March with a smile for
the change of subject

Oh I dont know much about such things said the young man with
another of his embarrassed flushes Mr Fulkerson seems to feel sure
that he is the one for us

Mr Fulkerson seemed to think that I was the one for you too said
March and he laughed Thats what makes me doubt his infallibility But
he couldnt do worse with Mr Beaton

Mr Dryfoos reddened and looked down as if unable or unwilling to cope
with the difficulty of making a polite protest against Marchs
selfdepreciation He said after a moment Its new business to all of
us except Mr Fulkerson But I think it will succeed I think we can do
some good in it

March asked rather absently Some good Then he added Oh yes I think
we can What do you mean by good Improve the public taste Elevate the
standard of literature Give young authors and artists a chance

This was the only good that had ever been in Marchs mind except the
good that was to come in a material way from his success to himself and
to his family

I dont know said the young man and he looked down in a shamefaced
fashion He lifted his head and looked into Marchs face I suppose I
was thinking that some time we might help along If we were to have those
sketches of yours about life in every part of New York

Marchs authorial vanity was tickled Fulkerson has been talking to you
about them He seemed to think they would be a card He believes that
theres no subject so fascinating to the general average of people
throughout the country as life in New York City and he liked my notion
of doing these things March hoped that Dryfoos would answer that
Fulkerson was perfectly enthusiastic about his notion but he did not
need this stimulus and at any rate he went on without it The fact
is its something that struck my fancy the moment I came here I found
myself intensely interested in the place and I began to make notes
consciously and unconsciously at once Yes I believe I can get
something quite attractive out of it I dont in the least know what it
will be yet except that it will be very desultory and I couldnt at all
say when I can get at it If we postpone the first number till February I
might get a little paper into that Yes I think it might be a good thing
for us March said with modest selfappreciation

If you can make the comfortable people understand how the uncomfortable
people live it will be a very good thing Mr March Sometimes it seems
to me that the only trouble is that we dont know one another well
enough and that the first thing is to do this The young fellow spoke
with the seriousness in which the beauty of his face resided Whenever he
laughed his face looked weak even silly It seemed to be a sense of this
that made him hang his head or turn it away at such times

Thats true said March from the surface only And then those phases
of low life are immensely picturesque Of course we must try to get the
contrasts of luxury for the sake of the full effect That wont be so
easy You cant penetrate to the dinnerparty of a millionaire under the
wing of a detective as you could to a carouse in Mulberry Street or to
his childrens nursery with a philanthropist as you can to a streetboys
lodginghouse March laughed and again the young man turned his head
away Still something can be done in that way by tact and patience




VII

That evening March went with his wife to return the call of the Dryfoos
ladies On their way uptown in the Elevated he told her of his talk with
young Dryfoos I confess I was a little ashamed before him afterward for
having looked at the matter so entirely from the aesthetic point of view
But of course you know if I went to work at those things with an
ethical intention explicitly in mind I should spoil them

Of course said his wife She had always heard him say something of
this kind about such things

He went on But I suppose thats just the point that such a nature as
young Dryfooss cant get hold of or keep hold of Were a queer lot
down there Isabelperfect menagerie If it hadnt been that Fulkerson
got us together and really seems to know what he did it for I should
say he was the oddest stick among us But when I think of myself and my
own crankiness for the literary department and young Dryfoos who ought
really to be in the pulpit or a monastery or something for publisher
and that young Beaton who probably hasnt a moral fibre in his
composition for the art man I dont know but we could give Fulkerson
odds and still beat him in oddity

His wife heaved a deep sigh of apprehension of renunciation of
monition Well Im glad you can feel so light about it Basil

Light I feel gay With Fulkerson at the helm I tell you the rocks and
the lee shore had better keep out of the way He laughed with pleasure
in his metaphor Just when you think Fulkerson has taken leave of his
senses he says or does something that shows he is on the most intimate
and inalienable terms with them all the time You know how Ive been
worrying over those foreign periodicals and trying to get some
translations from them for the first number Well Fulkerson has brought
his centipedal mind to bear on the subject and hes suggested that old
German friend of mine I was telling you ofthe one I met in the
restaurantthe friend of my youth

Do you think he could do it asked Mrs March sceptically

Hes a perfect Babel of strange tongues and hes the very man for the
work and I was ashamed I hadnt thought of him myself for I suspect he
needs the work

Well be careful how you get mixed up with him then Basil said his
wife who had the natural misgiving concerning the friends of her
husbands youth that all wives have You know the Germans are so
unscrupulously dependent You dont know anything about him now

Im not afraid of Lindau said March He was the best and kindest man
I ever saw the most highminded the most generous He lost a hand in
the war that helped to save us and keep us possible and that stump of
his is character enough for me

Oh you dont think I could have meant anything against him said Mrs
March with the tender fervor that every woman who lived in the time of
the war must feel for those who suffered in it All that I meant was
that I hoped you would not get mixed up with him too much Youre so apt
to be carried away by your impulses

They didnt carry me very far away in the direction of poor old Lindau
Im ashamed to think said March I meant all sorts of fine things by
him after I met him and then I forgot him and I had to be reminded of
him by Fulkerson

She did not answer him and he fell into a remorseful reverie in which
he rehabilitated Lindau anew and provided handsomely for his old age He
got him buried with military honors and had a shaft raised over him
with a medallion likeness by Beaton and an epitaph by himself by the
time they reached Fortysecond Street there was no time to write
Lindaus life however briefly before the train stopped

They had to walk up four blocks and then half a block across before they
came to the indistinctive brownstone house where the Dryfooses lived It
was larger than some in the same block but the next neighborhood of a
huge apartmenthouse dwarfed it again March thought he recognized the
very flat in which he had disciplined the surly janitor but he did not
tell his wife he made her notice the transition character of the street
which had been mostly built up in apartmenthouses with here and there a
single dwelling dropped far down beneath and beside them to that
jagtoothed effect on the skyline so often observable in such New York
streets I dont know exactly what the old gentleman bought here for
he said as they waited on the steps after ringing unless he expects to
turn it into flats byandby Otherwise I dont believe hell get his
money back

An Irish servingman with a certain surprise that delayed him said the
ladies were at home and let the Marches in and then carried their cards
upstairs The drawingroom where he said they could sit down while he
went on this errand was delicately decorated in white and gold and
furnished with a sort of extravagant good taste there was nothing to
object to in the satin furniture the pale soft rich carpet the
pictures and the bronze and china bricabrac except that their
costliness was too evident everything in the room meant money too
plainly and too much of it The Marches recognized this in the hoarse
whispers which people cannot get their voices above when they try to talk
away the interval of waiting in such circumstances they conjectured from
what they had heard of the Dryfooses that this tasteful luxury in no wise
expressed their civilization Though when you come to that said March
I dont know that Mrs Greens gimcrackery expresses ours

Well Basil I didnt take the gimcrackery That was your

The rustle of skirts on the stairs without arrested Mrs March in the
wellmerited punishment which she never failed to inflict upon her
husband when the question of the gimcrackerythey always called it
thatcame up She rose at the entrance of a brightlooking
prettylooking mature youngish lady in black silk of a neutral
implication who put out her hand to her and said with a very cheery
very ladylike accent Mrs March and then added to both of them while
she shook hands with March and before they could get the name out of
their months No not Miss Dryfoos Neither of them nor Mrs Dryfoos
Mrs Mandel The ladies will be down in a moment Wont you throw off
your sacque Mrs March Im afraid its rather warm here coming from
the outside

I will throw it back if youll allow me said Mrs March with a sort
of provisionality as if pending some uncertainty as to Mrs Mandels
quality and authority she did not feel herself justified in going
further

But if she did not know about Mrs Mandel Mrs Mandel seemed to know
about her Oh well do she said with a sort of recognition of the
propriety of her caution I hope you are feeling a little at home in New
York We heard so much of your trouble in getting a flat from Mr
Fulkerson

Well a true Bostonian doesnt give up quite so soon said Mrs March

But I will say New York doesnt seem so far away now were here

Im sure youll like it Every one does Mrs Mandel added to March
Its very sharp out isnt it

Rather sharp But after our Boston winters I dont know but I ought to
repudiate the word

Ah wait till you have been here through March said Mrs Mandel She
began with him but skillfully transferred the close of her remark and
the little smile of menace that went with it to his wife

Yes said Mrs March or April either Talk about our east winds

Oh Im sure they cant be worse than our winds Mrs Mandel returned
caressingly

If we escape New York pneumonia March laughed it will only be to
fall a prey to New York malaria as soon as the frost is out of the
ground

Oh but you know said Mrs Mandel I think our malaria has really
been slandered a little Its more a matter of drainageof plumbing I
dont believe it would be possible for malaria to get into this house
weve had it gone over so thoroughly

Mrs March said while she tried to divine Mrs Mandels position from
this statement Its certainly the first duty

If Mrs March could have had her way we should have had the drainage of
our whole ward put in order said her husband before we ventured to
take a furnished apartment for the winter

Mrs Mandel looked discreetly at Mrs March for permission to laugh at
this but at the same moment both ladies became preoccupied with a second
rustling on the stairs

Two tall welldressed young girls came in and Mrs Mandel introduced
Miss Dryfoos Mrs March and Miss Mela Dryfoos Mr March she added
and the girls shook hands in their several ways with the Marches

Miss Dryfoos had keen black eyes and her hair was intensely black Her
face but for the slight inward curve of the nose was regular and the
smallness of her nose and of her mouth did not weaken her face but gave
it a curious effect of fierceness of challenge She had a large black
fan in her hand which she waved in talking with a slow watchful
nervousness Her sister was blonde and had a profile like her brothers
but her chin was not so salient and the weak look of the mouth was not
corrected by the spirituality or the fervor of his eyes though hers were
of the same mottled blue She dropped into the low seat beside Mrs
Mandel and intertwined her fingers with those of the hand which Mrs
Mandel let her have She smiled upon the Marches while Miss Dryfoos
watched them intensely with her eyes first on one and then on the other
as if she did not mean to let any expression of theirs escape her

My mother will be down in a minute she said to Mrs March

I hope were not disturbing her It is so good of you to let us come in
the evening Mrs March replied

Oh not at all said the girl We receive in the evening

When we do receive Miss Mela put in We dont always get the chance
to She began a laugh which she checked at a smile from Mrs Mandel
which no one could have seen to be reproving

Miss Dryfoos looked down at her fan and looked up defiantly at Mrs
March I suppose you have hardly got settled We were afraid we would
disturb you when we called

Oh no We were very sorry to miss your visit We are quite settled in
our new quarters Of course its all very different from Boston

I hope its more of a sociable place there Miss Mela broke in again
I never saw such an unsociable place as New York Weve been in this
house three months and I dont believe that if we stayed three years any
of the neighbors would call

I fancy proximity doesnt count for much in New York March suggested

Mrs Mandel said Thats what I tell Miss Mela But she is a very social
nature and cant reconcile herself to the fact

No I cant the girl pouted I think it was twice as much fun in
Moffitt I wish I was there now

Yes said March I think theres a great deal more enjoyment in those
smaller places Theres not so much going on in the way of public
amusements and so people make more of one another There are not so many
concerts theatres operas

Oh theyve got a splendid operahouse in Moffitt Its just grand
said Miss Mela

Have you been to the opera here this winter Mrs March asked of the
elder girl

She was glaring with a frown at her sister and detached her eyes from
her with an effort What did you say she demanded with an absent
bluntness Oh yes Yes We went once Father took a box at the
Metropolitan

Then you got a good dose of Wagner I suppose said March

What asked the girl

I dont think Miss Dryfoos is very fond of Wagners music Mrs Mandel
said I believe you are all great Wagnerites in Boston

Im a very bad Bostonian Mrs Mandel I suspect myself of preferring
Verdi March answered

Miss Dryfoos looked down at her fan again and said I like Trovatore
the best

Its an opera I never get tired of said March and Mrs March and Mrs
Mandel exchanged a smile of compassion for his simplicity He detected
it and added But I dare say I shall come down with the Wagner fever in
time Ive been exposed to some malignant cases of it

That night we were there said Miss Mela they had to turn the gas
down all through one part of it and the papers said the ladies were
awful mad because they couldnt show their diamonds I dont wonder if
they all had to pay as much for their boxes as we did We had to pay
sixty dollars She looked at the Marches for their sensation at this
expense

March said Well I think I shall take my box by the month then It
must come cheaper wholesale

Oh no it dont said the girl glad to inform him The people that
own their boxes and that had to give fifteen or twenty thousand dollars
apiece for them have to pay sixty dollars a night whenever theres a
performance whether they go or not

Then I should go every night March said

Most of the ladies were low neck

March interposed Well I shouldnt go lowneck

The girl broke into a fondly approving laugh at his drolling Oh I
guess you love to train Us girls wanted to go low neck too but father
said we shouldnt and mother said if we did she wouldnt come to the
front of the box once Well she didnt anyway We might just as well
a gone low neck She stayed back the whole time and when they had that
dancethe ballet you knowshe just shut her eyes Well Conrad didnt
like that part much either but us girls and Mrs Mandel we brazened it
out right in the front of the box We were about the only ones there that
went high neck Conrad had to wear a swallowtail but father hadnt any
and he had to patch out with a white cravat You couldnt see what he had
on in the back o the box anyway

Mrs March looked at Miss Dryfoos who was waving her fan more and more
slowly up and down and who when she felt herself looked at returned
Mrs Marchs smile which she meant to be ingratiating and perhaps
sympathetic with a flash that made her start and then ran her fierce
eyes over Marchs face Here comes mother she said with a sort of
breathlessness as if speaking her thought aloud and through the open
door the Marches could see the old lady on the stairs

She paused halfway down and turning called up Coonrod Coonrod You
bring my shawl down with you

Her daughter Mela called out to her Now mother Christine ll give it
to you for not sending Mike

Well I dont know where he is Mely child the mother answered back
He aint never around when hes wanted and when he aint it seems like
a body couldnt git shet of him nohow

Well you ought to ring for him cried Miss Mela enjoying the joke

Her mother came in with a slow step her head shook slightly as she
looked about the room perhaps from nervousness perhaps from a touch of
palsy In either case the fact had a pathos which Mrs March confessed in
the affection with which she took her hard dry large old hand when she
was introduced to her and in the sincerity which she put into the hope
that she was well

Im just middlin Mrs Dryfoos replied I aint never so well
nowadays I tell fawther I dont believe it agrees with me very well
here but he says Ill git used to it Hes away now out at Moffitt
she said to March and wavered on foot a moment before she sank into a
chair She was a tall woman who had been a beautiful girl and her gray
hair had a memory of blondeness in it like Lindaus March noticed She
wore a simple silk gown of a Quakerly gray and she held a handkerchief
folded square as it had come from the laundress Something like the
Sabbath quiet of a little wooden meetinghouse in thick Western woods
expressed itself to him from her presence

Laws mother said Miss Mela what you got that old thing on for If
Id a known youd a come down in that

Coonrod said it was all right Mely said her mother

Miss Mela explained to the Marches Mother was raised among the
Dunkards and she thinks its wicked to wear anything but a gray silk
even for dressup

You haint never heared o the Dunkards I reckon the old woman said
to Mrs March Some folks calls em the Beardy Men because they dont
never shave and they wash feet like they do in the Testament My uncle
was one He raised me

I guess pretty much everybodys a Beardy Man nowadays if he aint a
Dunkard

Miss Mela looked round for applause of her sally but March was saying to
his wife Its a Pennsylvania German sect I believesomething like the
Quakers I used to see them when I was a boy

Arent they something like the Mennists asked Mrs Mandel

Theyre good people said the old woman and the world d be a heap
better off if there was more like em

Her son came in and laid a soft shawl over her shoulders before he shook
hands with the visitors I am glad you found your way here he said to
them

Christine who had been bending forward over her fan now lifted herself
up with a sigh and leaned back in her chair

Im sorry my father isnt here said the young man to Mrs March Hes
never met you yet

No and I should like to see him We hear a great deal about your
father you know from Mr Fulkerson

Oh I hope you dont believe everything Mr Fulkerson says about
people Mela cried Hes the greatest person for carrying on when he
gets going I ever saw It makes Christine just as mad when him and mother
gets to talking about religion she says she knows he dont care anything
more about it than the man in the moon I reckon he dont try it on much
with father

Your fawther aint ever been a perfessor her mother interposed but
hes always been a good churchgoin man

Not since we come to New York retorted the girl

Hes been all broke up since he come to New York said the old woman
with an aggrieved look

Mrs Mandel attempted a diversion Have you heard any of our great New
York preachers yet Mrs March

No I havent Mrs March admitted and she tried to imply by her
candid tone that she intended to begin hearing them the very next Sunday

There are a great many things here said Conrad to take your thoughts
off the preaching that you hear in most of the churches I think the city
itself is preaching the best sermon all the time

I dont know that I understand you said March

Mela answered for him Oh Conrad has got a lot of notions that nobody
can understand You ought to see the church he goes to when he does go
Id about as lief go to a Catholic church myself I dont see a bit o
difference Hes the greatest crony with one of their preachers he
dresses just like a priest and he says he is a priest She laughed for
enjoyment of the fact and her brother cast down his eyes

Mrs March in her turn tried to take from it the personal tone which
the talk was always assuming Have you been to the fall exhibition she
asked Christine and the girl drew herself up out of the abstraction she
seemed sunk in

The exhibition She looked at Mrs Mandel

The pictures of the Academy you know Mrs Mandel explained Where I
wanted you to go the day you had your dress tried on

No we havent been yet Is it good She had turned to Mrs March
again

I believe the fall exhibitions are never so good as the spring ones But
there are some good pictures

I dont believe I care much about pictures said Christine I dont
understand them

Ah thats no excuse for not caring about them said March lightly
The painters themselves dont half the time

The girl looked at him with that glance at once defiant and appealing
insolent and anxious which he had noticed before especially when she
stole it toward himself and his wife during her sisters babble In the
light of Fulkersons history of the family its origin and its ambition
he interpreted it to mean a sense of her sisters folly and an ignorant
will to override his opinion of anything incongruous in themselves and
their surroundings He said to himself that she was deathly proudtoo
proud to try to palliate anything but capable of anything that would put
others under her feet Her eyes seemed hopelessly to question his wifes
social quality and he fancied with not unkindly interest the
inexperienced girls doubt whether to treat them with much or little
respect He lost himself in fancies about her and her ideals necessarily
sordid of her possibilities of suffering of the triumphs and
disappointments before her Her sister would accept both with a lightness
that would keep no trace of either but in her they would sink lastingly
deep He came out of his reverie to find Mrs Dryfoos saying to him in
her hoarse voice

I think its a shame some of the picturs a body sees in the winders
They say theres a law aginst them things and if there is I dont
understand why the police dont take up them that paints em I hear
tell since I been here that theres women that goes to have picturs
took from them that way by men painters The point seemed aimed at
March as if he were personally responsible for the scandal and it fell
with a silencing effect for the moment Nobody seemed willing to take it
up and Mrs Dryfoos went on with an old womans severity I say they
ought to be all tarred and feathered and rode on a rail Theyd be
drummed out of town in Moffitt

Miss Mela said with a crowing laugh I should think they would And
they wouldnt anybody go low neck to the operahouse there eithernot
low neck the way they do here anyway

And that pack of worthless hussies her mother resumed that come out
on the stage and begun to kick

Laws mother the girl shouted I thought you said you had your eyes
shut

All but these two simpler creatures were abashed at the indecorum of
suggesting in words the commonplaces of the theatre and of art

Well I did Mely as soon as I could believe my eyes I dont know what
theyre doin in all their churches to let such things go on said the
old woman Its a sin and a shame I think Dont you Coonrod

A ring at the door cut short whatever answer he was about to deliver

If its going to be company Coonrod said his mother making an effort
to rise I reckon I better go upstairs

Its Mr Fulkerson I guess said Conrad He thought he might come
and at the mention of this light spirit Mrs Dryfoos sank contentedly
back in her chair and a relaxation of their painful tension seemed to
pass through the whole company Conrad went to the door himself the
servingman tentatively appeared some minutes later and let in
Fulkersons cheerful voice before his cheerful person

Ah how dye do Conrad Brought our friend Mr Beaton with me those
within heard him say and then after a sound of putting off overcoats
they saw him fill the doorway with his feet set square and his arms
akimbo




IX

Ah hello hello Fulkerson said in recognition of the Marches
Regular gathering of the clans How are you Mrs Dryfoos How do you
do Mrs Mandel Miss Christine Mela Aunt Hitty and all the folks How
you wuz He shook hands gayly all round and took a chair next the old
lady whose hand he kept in his own and left Conrad to introduce Beaton
But he would not let the shadow of Beatons solemnity fall upon the
company He began to joke with Mrs Dryfoos and to match rheumatisms
with her and he included all the ladies in the range of appropriate
pleasantries Ive brought Mr Beaton along tonight and I want you to
make him feel at home like you do me Mrs Dryfoos He hasnt got any
rheumatism to speak of but his parents live in Syracuse and hes a kind
of an orphan and weve just adopted him down at the office When you
going to bring the young ladies down there Mrs Mandel for a champagne
lunch I will have some hydroMela and Christine it heigh Hows that
for a little starter We dropped in at your place a moment Mrs March
and gave the young folks a few pointers about their studies My goodness
it does me good to see a boy like that of yours business from the word
go and your girl just scoops my youthful affections Shes a beauty and
I guess shes good too Well well what a world it is Miss Christine
wont you show Mr Beaton that seal ring of yours He knows about such
things and I brought him here to see it as much as anything Its an
intaglio I brought from the other side he explained to Mrs March and
I guess youll like to look at it Tried to give it to the Dryfoos
family and when I couldnt I sold it to em Bound to see it on Miss
Christines hand somehow Hold on Let him see it where it belongs
first

He arrested the girl in the motion she made to take off the ring and let
her have the pleasure of showing her hand to the company with the ring on
it Then he left her to hear the painters words about it which he
continued to deliver dissyllabically as he stood with her under a
gasjet twisting his elastic figure and bending his head over the ring

Well Mely child Fulkerson went on with an open travesty of her
mothers habitual address and how are you getting along Mrs Mandel
hold you up to the proprieties pretty strictly Well thats right You
know youd be roaming all over the pasture if she didnt

The girl gurgled out her pleasure in his funning and everybody took him
on his own ground of privileged character He brought them all together
in their friendliness for himself and before the evening was over he had
inspired Mrs Mandel to have them served with coffee and had made both
the girls feel that they had figured brilliantly in society and that two
young men had been devoted to them

Oh I think hes just as lovely as he can live said Mela as she stood
a moment with her sister on the scene of her triumph where the others
had left them after the departure of their guests

Who asked Christine deeply As she glanced down at her ring her eyes
burned with a softened fire

She had allowed Beaton to change it himself from the finger where she had
worn it to the finger on which he said she ought to wear it She did not
know whether it was right to let him but she was glad she had done it

Who Mr Fulkerson goosiepoosie Not that old stuckup Mr Beaton of
yours

He is proud assented Christine with a throb of exultation

Beaton and Fulkerson went to the Elevated station with the Marches but
the painter said he was going to walk home and Fulkerson let him go
alone

One way is enough for me he explained When I walk up I dont walk
down Byebye my son He began talking about Beaton to the Marches as
they climbed the station stairs together That fellow puzzles me I
dont know anybody that I have such a desire to kick and at the same
time that I want to flatter up so much Affect you that way he asked of
March

Well as far as the kicking goes yes

And how is it with you Mrs March

Oh I want to flatter him up

No really Why Hold on Ive got the change

Fulkerson pushed March away from the ticketoffice window and made them
his guests with the inexorable American hospitality for the ride
downtown Three he said to the ticketseller and when he had walked
them before him out on the platform and dropped his tickets into the urn
he persisted in his inquiry Why

Why because you always want to flatter conceited people dont you
Mrs March answered with a laugh

Do you Yes I guess you do You think Beaton is conceited

Well slightly Mr Fulkerson

I guess youre partly right said Fulkerson with a sigh so
unaccountable in its connection that they all laughed

An ideal busted March suggested

No not that exactly said Fulkerson But I had a notion maybe Beaton
wasnt conceited all the time

Oh Mrs March exulted nobody could be so conceited all the time as
Mr Beaton is most of the time He must have moments of the direst
modesty when hed be quite flatteryproof

Yes thats what I mean I guess thats what makes me want to kick him
Hes left compliments on my hands that no decent man would

Oh thats tragical said March

Mr Fulkerson Mrs March began with change of subject in her voice
who is Mrs Mandel

Who What do you think of her he rejoined Ill tell you about her
when we get in the cars Look at that thing Aint it beautiful

They leaned over the track and looked up at the next station where the
train just starting throbbed out the flameshot steam into the white
moonlight

The most beautiful thing in New Yorkthe one always and certainly
beautiful thing here said March and his wife sighed Yes yes She
clung to him and remained rapt by the sight till the train drew near
and then pulled him back in a panic

Well there aint really much to tell about her Fulkerson resumed when
they were seated in the car Shes an invention of mine

Of yours cried Mrs March

Of course exclaimed her husband

Yesat least in her present capacity She sent me a story for the
syndicate back in July some time along about the time I first met old
Dryfoos here It was a little too long for my purpose and I thought I
could explain better how I wanted it cut in a call than I could in a
letter She gave a Brooklyn address and I went to see her I found her
said Fulkerson with a vague defiance a perfect lady She was living
with an aunt over there and she had seen better days when she was a
girl and worse ones afterward I dont mean to say her husband was a bad
fellow I guess he was pretty good he was her musicteacher she met him
in Germany and they got married there and got through her property
before they came over here Well she didnt strike me like a person that
could make much headway in literature Her story was well enough but it
hadnt much sand in it kind ofwell academic you know I told her so
and she understood and cried a little but she did the best she could
with the thing and I took it and syndicated it She kind of stuck in my
mind and the first time I went to see the Dryfooses they were stopping
at a sort of family hotel then till they could find a house Fulkerson
broke off altogether and said I dont know as I know just how the
Dryfooses struck you Mrs March

Cant you imagine she answered with a kindly smile

Yes but I dont believe I could guess how they would have struck you
last summer when I first saw them My oh my there was the native earth
for you Mely is a pretty wild colt now but you ought to have seen her
before she was broken to harness

And Christine Ever see that black leopard they got up there in the
Central Park That was Christine Well I saw what they wanted They all
saw itnobody is a fool in all directions and the Dryfooses are in
their right senses a good deal of the time Well to cut a long story
short I got Mrs Mandel to take em in handthe old lady as well as the
girls She was a born lady and always lived like one till she saw
Mandel and that something academic that killed her for a writer was just
the very thing for them She knows the world well enough to know just how
much polish they can take on and she dont try to put on a bit more
See

Yes I can see said Mrs March

Well she took hold at once as ready as a hospitaltrained nurse and
there aint anything readier on this planet She runs the whole concern
socially and economically takes all the care of housekeeping off the old
ladys hands and goes round with the girls Bythebye Im going to
take my meals at your widows March and Conrads going to have his
lunch there Im sick of browsing about

Mr Marchs widow said his wife looking at him with provisional
severity

I have no widow Isabel he said and never expect to have till I
leave you in the enjoyment of my lifeinsurance I suppose Fulkerson
means the lady with the daughter who wanted to take us to board

Oh yes How are they getting on I do wonder Mrs March asked of
Fulkerson

Well theyve got one family to board but its a small one I guess
theyll pull through They didnt want to take any day boarders at first
the widow said I guess they have had to come to it

Poor things sighed Mrs March I hope theyll go back to the
country

Well I dont know When youve once tasted New YorkYou wouldnt go
back to Boston would you

Instantly

Fulkerson laughed out a tolerant incredulity

Beaton lit his pipe when he found himself in his room and sat down
before the dull fire in his grate to think It struck him there was a
dull fire in his heart a great deal like it and he worked out a fanciful
analogy with the coals still alive and the ashes creeping over them
and the dead clay and cinders He felt sick of himself sick of his life
and of all his works He was angry with Fulkerson for having got him into
that art department of his for having bought him up and he was bitter
at fate because he had been obliged to use the money to pay some pressing
debts and had not been able to return the check his father had sent him
He pitied his poor old father he ached with compassion for him and he
set his teeth and snarled with contempt through them for his own
baseness This was the kind of world it was but he washed his hands of
it The fault was in human nature and he reflected with pride that he
had at least not invented human nature he had not sunk so low as that
yet The notion amused him he thought he might get a Satanic epigram out
of it some way But in the mean time that girl that wild animal she
kept visibly tangibly before him if he put out his hand he might touch
hers he might pass his arm round her waist In Paris in a set he knew
there what an effect she would be with that look of hers and that
beauty all out of drawing They would recognize the flame quality in
her He imagined a joke about her being a fiery spirit or nymph naiad
whatever from one of her native gaswells He began to sketch on a bit
of paper from the table at his elbow vague lines that veiled and revealed
a level dismal landscape and a vast flame against an empty sky and a
shape out of the flame that took on a likeness and floated detached from
it The sketch ran up the left side of the sheet and stretched across it
Beaton laughed out Pretty good to let Fulkerson have that for the cover
of his first number In black and red it would be effective it would
catch the eye from the newsstands He made a motion to throw it on the
fire but held it back and slid it into the tabledrawer and smoked on
He saw the dummy with the other sketch in the open drawer which he had
brought away from Fulkersons in the morning and slipped in there and he
took it out and looked at it He made some criticisms in line with his
pencil on it correcting the drawing here and there and then he
respected it a little more though he still smiled at the feminine
qualitya young lady quality

In spite of his experience the night he called upon the Leightons Beaton
could not believe that Alma no longer cared for him She played at having
forgotten him admirably but he knew that a few months before she had
been very mindful of him He knew he had neglected them since they came
to New York where he had led them to expect interest if not attention
but he was used to neglecting people and he was somewhat less used to
being punished for itpunished and forgiven He felt that Alma had
punished him so thoroughly that she ought to have been satisfied with her
work and to have forgiven him in her heart afterward He bore no
resentment after the first tingling moments were past he rather admired
her for it and he would have been ready to go back half an hour later
and accept pardon and be on the footing of last summer again Even now he
debated with himself whether it was too late to call but decidedly a
quarter to ten seemed late The next day he determined never to call upon
the Leightons again but he had no reason for this it merely came into a
transitory scheme of conduct of retirement from the society of women
altogether and after dinner he went round to see them

He asked for the ladies and they all three received him Alma not
without a surprise that intimated itself to him and her mother with no
appreciable relenting Miss Woodburn with the needlework which she found
easier to be voluble over than a book expressed in her welcome a
neutrality both cordial to Beaton and loyal to Alma

Is it snowing outdos she asked briskly after the greetings were
transacted Mah goodness she said in answer to his apparent surprise
at the question Ah mahght as well have stayed in the Soath for all the
winter Ah have seen in New York yet

We dont often have snow much before NewYears said Beaton

Miss Woodburn is wild for a real Northern winter Mrs Leighton
explained

The othah naght Ah woke up and looked oat of the window and saw all the
roofs covered with snow and it turned oat to be nothing but moonlaght
Ah was never so disappointed in mah lahfe said Miss Woodburn

If youll come to St Barnaby next summer you shall have all the winter
you want said Alma

I cant let you slander St Barnaby in that way said Beaton with the
air of wishing to be understood as meaning more than he said

Yes returned Alma coolly I didnt know you were so fond of the
climate

I never think of it as a climate Its a landscape It doesnt matter
whether its hot or cold

With the thermometer twenty below youd find that it mattered Alma
persisted

Is that the way you feel about St Barnaby too Mrs Leighton Beaton
asked with affected desolation

I shall be glad enough to go back in the summer Mrs Leighton
conceded

And I should be glad to go now said Beaton looking at Alma He had
the dummy of Every Other Week in his hand and he saw Almas eyes
wandering toward it whenever he glanced at her I should be glad to go
anywhere to get out of a job Ive undertaken he continued to Mrs
Leighton Theyre going to start some sort of a new illustrated
magazine and theyve got me in for their art department Im not fit for
it Id like to run away Dont you want to advise me a little Mrs
Leighton You know how much I value your taste and Id like to have you
look at the design for the cover of the first number theyre going to
have a different one for every number I dont know whether youll agree
with me but I think this is rather nice

He faced the dummy round and then laid it on the table before Mrs
Leighton pushing some of her work aside to make room for it and standing
over her while she bent forward to look at it

Alma kept her place away from the table

Mah goodness Ho exciting said Miss Woodburn May anybody look

Everybody said Beaton

Well isnt it perfectly choming Miss Woodburn exclaimed Come and
look at this Miss Leighton she called to Alma who reluctantly
approached

What lines are these Mrs Leighton asked pointing to Beatons pencil
scratches

Theyre suggestions of modifications he replied

I dont think they improve it much What do you think Alma

Oh I dont know said the girl constraining her voice to an effect of
indifference and glancing carelessly down at the sketch The design
might be improved but I dont think those suggestions would do it

Theyre mine said Beaton fixing his eyes upon her with a beautiful
sad dreaminess that he knew he could put into them he spoke with a
dreamy remoteness of tonehis windharp stop Wetmore called it

I supposed so said Alma calmly

Oh mah goodness cried Miss Woodburn Is that the way you awtusts
talk to each othah Well Ahm glad Ahm not an awtustunless I could do
all the talking

Artists cannot tell a fib Alma said or even act one and she
laughed in Beatons upturned face

He did not unbend his dreamy gaze Youre quite right The suggestions
are stupid

Alma turned to Miss Woodburn You hear Even when we speak of our own
work

Ah nevah hoad anything lahke it

And the design itself Beaton persisted

Oh Im not an art editor Alma answered with a laugh of exultant
evasion

A tall dark gravelooking man of fifty with a swarthy face and
irongray mustache and imperial and goatee entered the room Beaton knew
the type he had been through Virginia sketching for one of the
illustrated papers and he had seen such men in Richmond Miss Woodburn
hardly needed to say May Ah introduce you to mah fathaw Conel
Woodburn Mr Beaton

The men shook hands and Colonel Woodburn said in that soft gentle
slow Southern voice without our Northern contractions I am very glad to
meet you sir happy to make yo acquaintance Do not move madam he
said to Mrs Leighton who made a deprecatory motion to let him pass to
the chair beyond her I can find my way He bowed a bulk that did not
lend itself readily to the devotion and picked up the ball of yarn she
had let drop out of her lap in half rising Yo worsteds madam

Yarn yarn Colonel Woodburn Alma shouted Youre quite incorrigible
A spade is a spade

But sometimes it is a trump my dear young lady said the Colonel with
unabated gallantry and when yo mothah uses yarn it is worsteds But I
respect worsteds even under the name of yarn our ladiesmy own mothah
and sistahshad to knit the socks we woreall we could get in the woe

Yes and aftah the woe his daughter put in The knitting has not
stopped yet in some places Have you been much in the Soath Mr Beaton

Beaton explained just how much

Well sir said the Colonel then you have seen a country making
gigantic struggles to retrieve its losses sir The South is advancing
with enormous strides sir

Too fast for some of us to keep up said Miss Woodburn in an audible
aside The pace in Charlottesboag is pofectly killing and we had to
drop oat into a slow place like New York

The progress in the South is material now said the Colonel and those
of us whose interests are in another direction find ourselvesisolated
isolated sir The intellectual centres are still in the Noth sir
the great cities draw the mental activity of the country to them sir
Necessarily New York is the metropolis

Oh everything comes here said Beaton impatient of the elders
ponderosity Another sort of man would have sympathized with the
Southerners willingness to talk of himself and led him on to speak of
his plans and ideals But the sort of man that Beaton was could not do
this he put up the dummy into the wrapper he had let drop on the floor
beside him and tied it round with string while Colonel Woodburn was
talking He got to his feet with the words he spoke and offered Mrs
Leighton his hand

Must you go she asked in surprise

I am on my way to a reception he said She had noticed that he was in
evening dress and now she felt the vague hurt that people invited
nowhere feel in the presence of those who are going somewhere She did
not feel it for herself but for her daughter and she knew Alma would
not have let her feel it if she could have prevented it But Alma had
left the room for a moment and she tacitly indulged this sense of injury
in her behalf

Please say goodnight to Miss Leighton for me Beaton continued He
bowed to Miss Woodburn Goodnight Miss Woodburn and to her father
bluntly Goodnight

Goodnight sir said the Colonel with a sort of severe suavity

Oh isnt he choming Miss Woodburn whispered to Mrs Leighton when
Beaton left the room

Alma spoke to him in the hall without You knew that was my design Mr
Beaton Why did you bring it

Why He looked at her in gloomy hesitation

Then he said You know why I wished to talk it over with you to serve
you please you get back your good opinion But Ive done neither the
one nor the other Ive made a mess of the whole thing

Alma interrupted him Has it been accepted

It will be accepted if you will let it

Let it she laughed I shall be delighted She saw him swayed a
little toward her Its a matter of business isnt it

Purely Goodnight

When Alma returned to the room Colonel Woodburn was saying to Mrs
Leighton I do not contend that it is impossible madam but it is very
difficult in a thoroughly commercialized society like yours to have the
feelings of a gentleman How can a business man whose prosperity whose
earthly salvation necessarily lies in the adversity of some one else be
delicate and chivalrous or even honest If we could have had time to
perfect our system at the South to eliminate what was evil and develop
what was good in it we should have had a perfect system But the virus
of commercialism was in us too it forbade us to make the best of a
divine institution and tempted us to make the worst Now the curse is on
the whole country the dollar is the measure of every value the stamp of
every success What does not sell is a failure and what sells succeeds

The hobby is oat mah deah said Miss Woodburn in an audible aside to
Alma

Were you speaking of me Colonel Woodburn Alma asked

Surely not my dear young lady

But hes been saying that awtusts are just as greedy aboat money as
anybody said his daughter

The law of commercialism is on everything in a commercial society the
Colonel explained softening the tone in which his convictions were
presented The final reward of art is money and not the pleasure of
creating

Perhaps they would be willing to take it all oat in that if othah people
would let them pay their bills in the pleasure of creating his daughter
teased

They are helpless like all the rest said her father with the same
deference to her as to other women I do not blame them

Oh mah goodness Didnt you say sir that Mr Beaton had bad manners

Alma relieved a confusion which he seemed to feel in reference to her
Bad manners He has no manners That is when hes himself He has
pretty good ones when hes somebody else

Miss Woodburn began Oh mah and then stopped herself Almas mother
looked at her with distressed question but the girl seemed perfectly
cool and contented and she gave her mind provisionally to a point
suggested by Colonel Woodburns talk

Still I cant believe it was right to hold people in slavery to whip
them and sell them It never did seem right to me she added in apology
for her extreme sentiments to the gentleness of her adversary

I quite agree with you madam said the Colonel Those were the abuses
of the institution But if we had not been vitiated on the one hand and
threatened on the other by the spirit of commercialism from the
Northand from Europe toothose abuses could have been eliminated and
the institution developed in the direction of the mild patriarchalism of
the divine intention The Colonel hitched his chair which figured a
hobby careering upon its hind legs a little toward Mrs Leighton and the
girls approached their heads and began to whisper they fell
deferentially silent when the Colonel paused in his argument and went on
again when he went on

At last they heard Mrs Leighton saying And have you heard from the
publishers about your book yet

Then Miss Woodburn cut in before her father could answer The coase of
commercialism is on that too They are trahing to fahnd oat whethah it
will pay

And they are rightquite right said the Colonel There is no longer
any other criterion and even a work that attacks the system must be
submitted to the tests of the system

The system wont accept destruction on any othah tomes said Miss
Woodburn demurely




XI

At the reception where two men in livery stood aside to let him pass up
the outside steps of the house and two more helped him off with his
overcoat indoors and a fifth miscalled his name into the drawingroom
the Syracuse stonecutters son met the niece of Mrs Horn and began at
once to tell her about his evening at the Dryfooses He was in very good
spirits for so far as he could have been elated or depressed by his
parting with Alma Leighton he had been elated she had not treated his
impudence with the contempt that he felt it deserved she must still be
fond of him and the warm sense of this by operation of an obscure but
wellrecognized law of the masculine being disposed him to be rather
fond of Miss Vance She was a slender girl whose semiaesthetic dress
flowed about her with an accentuation of her long forms and redeemed
them from censure by the very frankness with which it confessed them
nobody could have said that Margaret Vance was too tall Her pretty
little head which she had an effect of choosing to have little in the
same spirit of judicious defiance had a good deal of reading in it she
was proud to know literary and artistic fashions as well as society
fashions She liked being singled out by an exterior distinction so
obvious as Beatons and she listened with sympathetic interest to his
account of those people He gave their natural history reality by drawing
upon his own he reconstructed their plebeian past from the experiences
of his childhood and his youth of the preParisian period and he had a
pang of suicidal joy in insulting their ignorance of the world

What different kinds of people you meet said the girl at last with an
envious sigh Her reading had enlarged the bounds of her imagination if
not her knowledge the novels nowadays dealt so much with very common
people and made them seem so very much more worth while than the people
one met

She said something like this to Beaton He answered You can meet the
people Im talking of very easily if you want to take the trouble Its
what they came to New York for I fancy its the great ambition of their
lives to be met

Oh yes said Miss Vance fashionably and looked down then she looked
up and said intellectually Dont you think its a great pity How much
better for them to have stayed where they were and what they were

Then you could never have had any chance of meeting them said Beaton
I dont suppose you intend to go out to the gas country

No said Miss Vance amused Not that I shouldnt like to go

What a daring spirit You ought to be on the staff of Every Other
Week said Beaton

The staffEvery Other Week What is it

The missing link the longfelt want of a tie between the Arts and the
Dollars Beaton gave her a very picturesque a very dramatic sketch of
the theory the purpose and the personnel of the new enterprise

Miss Vance understood too little about business of any kind to know how
it differed from other enterprises of its sort She thought it was
delightful she thought Beaton must be glad to be part of it though he
had represented himself so bored so injured by Fulkersons insisting
upon having him And is it a secret Is it a thing not to be spoken of

Tutt altro Fulkerson will be enraptured to have it spoken of in
society He would pay any reasonable bill for the advertisement

What a delightful creature Tell him it shall all be spent in charity

He would like that He would get two paragraphs out of the fact and
your name would go into the Literary Notes of all the newspapers

Oh but I shouldnt want my name used cried the girl half horrified
into fancying the situation real

Then youd better not say anything about Every Other Week Fulkerson
is preternaturally unscrupulous

March began to think so too at times He was perpetually suggesting
changes in the makeup of the first number with a view to its greater
vividness of effect One day he came and said This thing isnt going to
have any sort of get up and howl about it unless you have a paper in the
first number going for Bevanss novels Better get Maxwell to do it

Why I thought you liked Bevanss novels

So I did but where the good of Every Other Week is concerned I am a
Roman father The popular gag is to abuse Bevans and Maxwell is the man
to do it There hasnt been a new magazine started for the last three
years that hasnt had an article from Maxwell in its first number cutting
Bevans all to pieces If people dont see it theyll think Every Other
Week is some old thing

March did not know whether Fulkerson was joking or not He suggested
Perhaps theyll think its an old thing if they do see it

Well get somebody else then or else get Maxwell to write under an
assumed name OrI forgot Hell be anonymous under our system anyway
Now there aint a more popular racket for us to work in that first number
than a good swinging attack on Bevans People read his books and quarrel
over em and the critics are all against him and a regular flaying
with salt and vinegar rubbed in afterward will tell more with people who
like good oldfashioned fiction than anything else I like Bevanss
things but dad burn it when it comes to that first number Id offer
up anybody

What an immoral little wretch you are Fulkerson said March with a
laugh

Fulkerson appeared not to be very strenuous about the attack on the
novelist Say he called out gayly what should you think of a paper
defending the late lamented system of slavery

What do you mean Fulkerson asked March with a puzzled smile

Fulkerson braced his knees against his desk and pushed himself back but
kept his balance to the eye by canting his hat sharply forward Theres
an old cock over there at the widows thats written a book to prove that
slavery was and is the only solution of the labor problem Hes a
Southerner

I should imagine March assented

Hes got it on the brain that if the South could have been let alone by
the commercial spirit and the pseudophilanthropy of the North it would
have worked out slavery into a perfectly ideal condition for the laborer
in which he would have been insured against want and protected in all
his personal rights by the state He read the introduction to me last
night I didnt catch on to all the pointshis daughters an awfully
pretty girl and I was carrying that fact in my mind all the time too
you knowbut thats about the gist of it

Seems to regard it as a lost opportunity said March

Exactly What a mighty catchy title Neigh Look well on the
titlepage

Well written

I reckon so I dont know The Colonel read it mighty eloquently

It mightnt be such bad business said March in a muse Could you get
me a sight of it without committing yourself

If the Colonel hasnt sent it off to another publisher this morning He
just got it back with thanks yesterday He likes to keep it travelling

Well try it Ive a notion it might be a curious thing

Look here March said Fulkerson with the effect of taking a fresh
hold I wish you could let me have one of those New York things of yours
for the first number After all thats going to be the great card

I couldnt Fulkerson I couldnt really I want to philosophize the
material and Im too new to it all yet I dont want to do merely
superficial sketches

Of course Of course I understand that Well I dont want to hurry
you Seen that old fellow of yours yet I think we ought to have that
translation in the first number dont you We want to give em a notion
of what were going to do in that line

Yes said March and I was going out to look up Lindau this morning
Ive inquired at Maronis and he hasnt been there for several days
Ive some idea perhaps hes sick But they gave me his address and Im
going to see

Well thats right We want the first number to be the keynote in every
way

March shook his head You cant make it so The first number is bound to
be a failure always as far as the representative character goes Its
invariably the case Look at the first numbers of all the things youve
seen started Theyre experimental almost amateurish and necessarily
so not only because the men that are making them up are comparatively
inexperienced like ourselves but because the material sent them to deal
with is more or less consciously tentative People send their adventurous
things to a new periodical because the whole thing is an adventure Ive
noticed that quality in all the volunteer contributions its in the
articles that have been done to order even No Ive about made up my
mind that if we can get one good striking paper into the first number
that will take peoples minds off the others we shall be doing all we
can possibly hope for I should like March added less seriously to
make up three numbers ahead and publish the third one first

Fulkerson dropped forward and struck his fist on the desk Its a
firstrate idea Why not do it

March laughed Fulkerson I dont believe theres any quackish thing you
wouldnt do in this cause From time to time Im thoroughly ashamed of
being connected with such a charlatan

Fulkerson struck his hat sharply backward Ah dad burn it To give that
thing the right kind of start Id walk up and down Broadway between two
boards with the titlepage of Every Other Week facsimiled on one and my
name and address on the

He jumped to his feet and shouted March Ill do it

What

Ill hire a lot of fellows to make mudturtles of themselves and Ill
have a lot of big facsimiles of the titlepage and Ill paint the town
red

March looked aghast at him Oh come now Fulkerson

I mean it I was in London when a new man had taken hold of the old
Cornhill and they were trying to boom it and they had a procession of
these mudturtles that reached from Charing Cross to Temple Bar Cornhill
Magazine Sixpence Not a dull page in it I said to myself then that it
was the livest thing I ever saw I respected the man that did that thing
from the bottom of my heart I wonder I ever forgot it But it shows what
a shaky thing the human mind is at its best

You infamous mountebank said March with great amusement at
Fulkersons access you call that congeries of advertising instinct of
yours the human mind at its best Come dont be so diffident Fulkerson
Well Im off to find Lindau and when I come back I hope Mr Dryfoos
will have you under control I dont suppose youll be quite sane again
till after the first number is out Perhaps public opinion will sober you
then

Confound it March How do you think they will take it I swear Im
getting so nervous I dont know half the time which end of me is up I
believe if we dont get that thing out by the first of February it ll be
the death of me

Couldnt wait till Washingtons Birthday I was thinking it would give
the day a kind of distinction and strike the public imagination if

No Ill be dogged if I could Fulkerson lapsed more and more into the
parlance of his early life in this season of strong excitement I
believe if Beaton lags any on the art leg Ill kill him

Well I shouldnt mind your killing Beaton said March tranquilly as
he went out

He went over to Third Avenue and took the Elevated down to Chatham
Square He found the variety of people in the car as unfailingly
entertaining as ever He rather preferred the East Side to the West Side
lines because they offered more nationalities conditions and
characters to his inspection They draw not only from the uptown
American region but from all the vast hive of populations swarming
between them and the East River He had found that according to the
hour American husbands going to and from business and American wives
going to and from shopping prevailed on the Sixth Avenue road and that
the most picturesque admixture to these familiar aspects of human nature
were the brilliant eyes and complexions of the American Hebrews who
otherwise contributed to the effect of wellclad comfort and
citizenselfsatisfaction of the crowd Now and then he had found himself
in a car mostly filled with Neapolitans from the constructions far up the
line where he had read how they are worked and fed and housed like
beasts and listening to the jargon of their unintelligible dialect he
had occasion for pensive question within himself as to what notion these
poor animals formed of a free republic from their experience of life
under its conditions and whether they found them practically very
different from those of the immemorial brigandage and enforced complicity
with rapine under which they had been born But after all this was an
infrequent effect however massive of travel on the West Side whereas
the East offered him continual entertainment in like sort The sort was
never quite so squalid For short distances the lowest poverty the
hardest pressed labor must walk but March never entered a car without
encountering some interesting shape of shabby adversity which was almost
always adversity of foreign birth New York is still popularly supposed
to be in the control of the Irish but March noticed in these East Side
travels of his what must strike every observer returning to the city
after a prolonged absence the numerical subordination of the dominant
race If they do not outvote them the people of Germanic of Slavonic
of Pelasgic of Mongolian stock outnumber the prepotent Celts and March
seldom found his speculation centred upon one of these The small eyes
the high cheeks the broad noses the puff lips the bare cuefilleted
skulls of Russians Poles Czechs Chinese the furtive glitter of
Italians the blonde dulness of Germans the cold quiet of
Scandinaviansfire under icewere aspects that he identified and that
gave him abundant suggestion for the personal histories he constructed
and for the more publicspirited reveries in which he dealt with the
future economy of our heterogeneous commonwealth It must be owned that
he did not take much trouble about this what these poor people were
thinking hoping fearing enjoying suffering just where and how they
lived who and what they individually werethese were the matters of his
waking dreams as he stared hard at them while the train raced farther
into the gay uglinessthe shapeless graceful reckless picturesqueness
of the Bowery

There were certain signs certain facades certain audacities of the
prevailing hideousness that always amused him in that uproar to the eye
which the strident forms and colors made He was interested in the
insolence with which the railway had drawn its erasing line across the
Corinthian front of an old theatre almost grazing its fluted pillars
and flouting its dishonored pediment The colossal effigies of the fat
women and the tuftheaded Circassian girls of cheap museums the vistas
of shabby cross streets the survival of an old hiproofed house here and
there at their angles the Swiss chalet histrionic decorativeness of the
stations in prospect or retrospect the vagaries of the lines that
narrowed together or stretched apart according to the width of the
avenue but always in wanton disregard of the life that dwelt and bought
and sold and rejoiced or sorrowed and clattered or crawled around
below abovewere features of the frantic panorama that perpetually
touched his sense of humor and moved his sympathy Accident and then
exigency seemed the forces at work to this extraordinary effect the play
of energies as free and planless as those that force the forest from the
soil to the sky and then the fierce struggle for survival with the
stronger life persisting over the deformity the mutilation the
destruction the decay of the weaker The whole at moments seemed to him
lawless godless the absence of intelligent comprehensive purpose in
the huge disorder and the violent struggle to subordinate the result to
the greater good penetrated with its dumb appeal the consciousness of a
man who had always been too selfenwrapped to perceive the chaos to which
the individual selfishness must always lead

But there was still nothing definite nothing better than a vague
discomfort however poignant in his half recognition of such facts and
he descended the station stairs at Chatham Square with a sense of the
neglected opportunities of painters in that locality He said to himself
that if one of those fellows were to see in Naples that turmoil of cars
trucks and teams of every sort intershot with footpassengers going and
coming to and from the crowded pavements under the web of the railroad
tracks overhead and amid the spectacular approach of the streets that
open into the square he would have it down in his sketchbook at once
He decided simultaneously that his own local studies must be illustrated
and that he must come with the artist and show him just which bits to do
not knowing that the two arts can never approach the same material from
the same point He thought he would particularly like his illustrator to
render the Dickensy cockneyish quality of the shabbygenteel
balladseller of whom he stopped to ask his way to the street where
Lindau lived and whom he instantly perceived to be with his stock in
trade the sufficient object of an entire study by himself He had his
ballads strung singly upon a cord against the house wall and held down
in piles on the pavement with stones and blocks of wood Their control in
this way intimated a volatility which was not perceptible in their
sentiment They were mostly tragical or doleful some of them dealt with
the wrongs of the workingman others appealed to a gay experience of the
high seas but vastly the greater part to memories and associations of an
Irish origin some still uttered the poetry of plantation life in the
artless accents of the endman Where they trusted themselves with
syntax that yielded promptly to any exigency of rhythmic art to the
ordinary American speech it was to strike directly for the affections
to celebrate the domestic ties and above all to embalm the memories of
angel and martyr mothers whose dissipated sons deplored their sufferings
too late March thought this not at all a bad thing in them he smiled in
patronage of their simple pathos he paid the tribute of a laugh when the
poet turned as he sometimes did from his conception of angel and martyr
motherhood and portrayed the mother in her more familiar phases of
virtue and duty with the retributive shingle or slipper in her hand He
bought a pocketful of this literature popular in a sense which the most
successful book can never be and enlisted the ballad vendor so deeply in
the effort to direct him to Lindaus dwelling by the best way that he
neglected another customer till a sarcasm on his absentmindedness stung
hint to retort Im atrying to answer a gentleman a civil question
thats where the absentminded comes in

It seemed for some reason to be a day of leisure with the Chinese
dwellers in Mott Street which March had been advised to take first They
stood about the tops of basement stairs and walked two and two along the
dirty pavement with their little hands tucked into their sleeves across
their breasts aloof in immaculate cleanliness from the filth around
them and scrutinizing the scene with that cynical sneer of faint
surprise to which all aspects of our civilization seem to move their
superiority Their numbers gave character to the street and rendered not
them but what was foreign to them strange there so that March had a
sense of missionary quality in the old Catholic church built long before
their incursion was dreamed of It seemed to have come to them there and
he fancied in the statued saint that looked down from its facade
something not so much tolerant as tolerated something propitiatory
almost deprecatory It was a fancy of course the street was
sufficiently peopled with Christian children at any rate swarming and
shrieking at their games and presently a Christian mother appeared
pushed along by two policemen on a handcart with a gelatinous tremor
over the paving and a gelatinous jouncing at the curbstones She lay with
her face to the sky sending up an inarticulate lamentation but the
indifference of the officers forbade the notion of tragedy in her case
She was perhaps a local celebrity the children left off their games and
ran gayly trooping after her even the young fellow and young girl
exchanging playful blows in a robust flirtation at the corner of a liquor
store suspended their scuffle with a pleased interest as she passed
March understood the unwillingness of the poor to leave the worst
conditions in the city for comfort and plenty in the country when he
reflected upon this dramatic incident one of many no doubt which daily
occur to entertain them in such streets A small town could rarely offer
anything comparable to it and the country never He said that if life
appeared so hopeless to him as it must to the dwellers in that
neighborhood he should not himself be willing to quit its distractions
its alleviations for the vague promise of unknown good in the distance
somewhere

But what charm could such a man as Lindau find in such a place It could
not be that he lived there because he was too poor to live elsewhere
with a shutting of the heart March refused to believe this as he looked
round on the abounding evidences of misery and guiltily remembered his
neglect of his old friend Lindau could probably find as cheap a lodging
in some decenter part of the town and in fact there was some
amelioration of the prevailing squalor in the quieter street which he
turned into from Mott

A woman with a tiedup face of toothache opened the door for him when he
pulled with a shiver of foreboding the bellknob from which a yard of
rusty crape dangled But it was not Lindau who was dead for the woman
said he was at home and sent March stumbling up the four or five dark
flights of stairs that led to his tenement It was quite at the top of
the house and when March obeyed the GermanEnglish Komm that followed
his knock he found himself in a kitchen where a meagre breakfast was
scattered in stale fragments on the table before the stove The place was
bare and cold a halfempty beer bottle scarcely gave it a convivial air
On the left from this kitchen was a room with a bed in it which seemed
also to be a cobblers shop on the right through a door that stood
ajar came the GermanEnglish voice again saying this time Hier




XII

March pushed the door open into a room like that on the left but with a
writingdesk instead of a cobblers bench and a bed where Lindau sat
propped up with a coat over his shoulders and a skullcap on his head
reading a book from which he lifted his eyes to stare blankly over his
spectacles at March His hairy old breast showed through the nightshirt
which gaped apart the stump of his left arm lay upon the book to keep it
open

Ah my tear yong friendt Passil Marge Iss it you he called out
joyously the next moment

Why are you sick Lindau March anxiously scanned his face in taking
his hand

Lindau laughed No Im all righdt Only a lidtle lazy and a lidtle
eggonomigal Idts jeaper to stay in pedt sometimes as to geep a fire
agoin all the time Dont wandt to gome too hardt on the brafer Mann
you know

 Braver Mann er schafft mir zu essen

You remember Heine You readt Heine still Who is your favorite boet
now Passil You write some boetry yourself yet No Well I am gladt to
zee you Brush those baperss off of that jair Well idt is goodt for
zore eyess How didt you findt where I lif

They told me at Maronis said March He tried to keep his eyes on
Lindaus face and not see the discomfort of the room but he was aware
of the shabby and frowsy bedding the odor of stale smoke and the pipes
and tobacco shreds mixed with the books and manuscripts strewn over the
leaf of the writingdesk He laid down on the mass the pile of foreign
magazines he had brought under his arm They gave me another address
first

Yes I have chust gome here said Lindau Idt is not very coy Neigh

It might be gayer March admitted with a smile Still he added
soberly a good many people seem to live in this part of the town
Apparently they die here too Lindau There is crape on your outside
door I didnt know but it was for you

Nodt this time said Lindau in the same humor Berhaps some other
time We geep the ondertakers bratty puzy down here

Well said March undertakers must live even if the rest of us have
to die to let them Lindau laughed and March went on But Im glad it
isnt your funeral Lindau And you say youre not sick and so I dont
see why we shouldnt come to business

Pusiness Lindau lifted his eyebrows You gome on pusiness

And pleasure combined said March and he went on to explain the
service he desired at Lindaus hands

The old man listened with serious attention and with assenting nods that
culminated in a spoken expression of his willingness to undertake the
translations March waited with a sort of mechanical expectation of his
gratitude for the work put in his way but nothing of the kind came from
Lindau and March was left to say Well everything is understood then
and I dont know that I need add that if you ever want any little advance
on the work

I will ask you said Lindau quietly and I thank you for that But I
can wait I tont needt any money just at bresent As if he saw some
appeal for greater frankness in Marchs eye he went on I tidnt gome
here begause I was too boor to lif anywhere else and I tont stay in
pedt begause I couldnt haf a fire to geep warm if I wanted it Im nodt
zo padt off as Marmontel when he went to Paris Im a lidtle loaxurious
that is all If I stay in pedt its zo I can fling money away on
somethings else Heigh

But what are you living here for Lindau March smiled at the irony
lurking in Lindaus words

Well you zee I foundt I was begoming a lidtle too moch of an
aristograt I hadt a room oap in Creenvidge Willage among dose pig pugs
over on the West Side and I foundtLiudaus voice lost its jesting
quality and his face darkenedthat I was beginning to forget the
boor

I should have thought said March with impartial interest that you
might have seen poverty enough now and then in Greenwich Village to
remind you of its existence

Nodt like here said Lindau Andt you must zee it all the dtimezee
it hear it smell it dtaste itor you forget it That is what I gome
here for I was begoming a ploated aristograt I thought I was nodt like
these beople down here when I gome down once to look aroundt I thought
I must be somethings else and zo I zaid I better take myself in time
and I gome here among my brothersthe becears and the thiefs A noise
made itself heard in the next room as if the door were furtively opened
and a faint sound of tiptoeing and of hands clawing on a table

Thiefs Lindau repeated with a shout Lidtle thiefs that gabture
your breakfast Ah ha ha A wild scurrying of feet joyous cries and
tittering and a slamming door followed upon his explosion and he
resumed in the silence Idt is the children cot pack from school They
gome and steal what I leaf there on my daple Idts one of our lidtle
chokes we onderstand one another thats all righdt Once the gobbler in
the other room there he used to chase em he couldnt onderstand their
lidtle tricks Now dot gopplers teadt and he tont chase em any more
He was a Bohemian Gindt of grazy I cuess

Well its a sociable existence March suggested But perhaps if you
let them have the things without stealing

Oh no no Most nodt mage them too gonceitedt They mostnt go and feel
themselfs petter than those boor millionairss that hadt to steal their
money

March smiled indulgently at his old friends violence Oh there are
fagots and fagots you know Lindau perhaps not all the millionaires are
so guilty

Let us speak German cried Lindau in his own tongue pushing his book
aside and thrusting his skullcap back from his forehead How much money
can a man honestly earn without wronging or oppressing some other man

Well if youll let me answer in English said March I should say
about five thousand dollars a year I name that figure because its my
experience that I never could earn more but the experience of other men
may be different and if they tell me they can earn ten or twenty or
fifty thousand a year Im not prepared to say they cant do it

Lindau hardly waited for his answer Not the most gifted man that ever
lived in the practice of any art or science and paid at the highest
rate that exceptional genius could justly demand from those who have
worked for their money could ever earn a million dollars It is the
landlords and the merchant princes the railroad kings and the coal
barons the oppressors to whom you instinctively give the titles of
tyrantsit is these that make the millions but no man earns them What
artist what physician what scientist what poet was ever a
millionaire

I can only think of the poet Rogers said March amused by Lindaus
tirade But he was as exceptional as the other Rogers the martyr who
died with warm feet Lindau had apparently not understood his joke and
he went on with the American ease of mind about everything But you
must allow Lindau that some of those fellows dont do so badly with
their guilty gains Some of them give work to armies of poor people

Lindau furiously interrupted Yes when they have gathered their
millions together from the hunger and cold and nakedness and ruin and
despair of hundreds of thousands of other men they give work to the
poor They give work They allow their helpless brothers to earn enough
to keep life in them They give work Who is it gives toil and where
will your rich men be when once the poor shall refuse to give toil Why
you have come to give me work

March laughed outright Well Im not a millionaire anyway Lindau and
I hope you wont make an example of me by refusing to give toil I dare
say the millionaires deserve it but Id rather they wouldnt suffer in
my person

No returned the old man mildly relaxing the fierce glare he had bent
upon March No man deserves to suffer at the hands of another I lose
myself when I think of the injustice in the world But I must not forget
that I am like the worst of them

You might go up Fifth Avenue and live among the rich awhile when youre
in danger of that suggested March At any rate he added by an
impulse which he knew he could not justify to his wife I wish youd
come some day and lunch with their emissary Ive been telling Mrs March
about you and I want her and the children to see you Come over with
these things and report He put his hand on the magazines as he rose

I will come said Lindau gently

Shall I give you your book asked March

No I gidt oap bretty soon

Andandcan you dress yourself

I vhistle and one of those lidtle fellowss comess We haf to dake gare
of one another in a blace like this Idt iss nodt like the worldt said
Lindau gloomily

March thought he ought to cheer him up Oh it isnt such a bad world
Lindau After all the average of millionaires is small in it He added
And I dont believe theres an American living that could look at that
arm of yours and not wish to lend you a hand for the one you gave us
all March felt this to be a fine turn and his voice trembled slightly
in saying it

Lindau smiled grimly You think zo I wouldnt moch like to drost em
Ive driedt idt too often He began to speak German again fiercely
Besides they owe me nothing Do you think I knowingly gave my hand to
save this oligarchy of traders and tricksters this aristocracy of
railroad wreckers and stock gamblers and mineslave drivers and millserf
owners No I gave it to the slave the slaveha ha hawhom I helped
to unshackle to the common liberty of hunger and cold And you think I
would be the beneficiary of such a state of things

Im sorry to hear you talk so Lindau said March very sorry He
stopped with a look of pain and rose to go Lindau suddenly broke into a
laugh and into English

Oh well it is only dalk Passil and it toes me goodt My parg is
worse than my pidte I cuess I pring these things roundt bretty soon
Goodbye Passil my tear poy Auf wiedersehen




XIII

March went away thinking of what Lindau had said but not for the
impersonal significance of his words so much as for the light they cast
upon Lindau himself He thought the words violent enough but in
connection with what he remembered of the cheery poetic hopeful
idealist they were even more curious than lamentable In his own life of
comfortable reverie he had never heard any one talk so before but he had
read something of the kind now and then in blatant labor newspapers which
he had accidentally fallen in with and once at a strikers meeting he
had heard rich people denounced with the same frenzy He had made his own
reflections upon the tastelessness of the rhetoric and the obvious
buncombe of the motive and he had not taken the matter seriously

He could not doubt Lindaus sincerity and he wondered how he came to
that way of thinking From his experience of himself he accounted for a
prevailing literary quality in it he decided it to be from Lindaus
reading and feeling rather than his reflection That was the notion he
formed of some things he had met with in Ruskin to much the same effect
he regarded them with amusement as the chimeras of a rhetorician run away
with by his phrases

But as to Lindau the chief thing in his mind was a conception of the
droll irony of a situation in which so fervid a hater of millionaires
should be working indirectly at least for the prosperity of a man like
Dryfoos who as March understood had got his money together out of
every gamblers chance in speculation and all a schemers thrift from
the error and need of others The situation was not more incongruous
however than all the rest of the Every Other Week affair It seemed to
him that there were no crazy fortuities that had not tended to its
existence and as time went on and the day drew near for the issue of
the first number the sense of this intensified till the whole lost at
moments the quality of a waking fact and came to be rather a fantastic
fiction of sleep

Yet the heterogeneous forces did cooperate to a reality which March
could not deny at least in their presence and the first number was
representative of all their nebulous intentions in a tangible form As a
result it was so respectable that March began to respect these
intentions began to respect himself for combining and embodying them in
the volume which appealed to him with a novel fascination when the first
advance copy was laid upon his desk Every detail of it was tiresomely
familiar already but the whole had a fresh interest now He now saw how
extremely fit and effective Miss Leightons decorative design for the
cover was printed in black and brickred on the delicate gray tone of
the paper It was at once attractive and refined and he credited Beaton
with quite all he merited in working it over to the actual shape The
touch and the taste of the art editor were present throughout the number
As Fulkerson said Beaton had caught on with the delicacy of a
hummingbird and the tenacity of a bulldog to the virtues of their
illustrative process and had worked it for all it was worth There were
seven papers in the number and a poem on the last page of the cover and
he had found some graphic comment for each It was a larger proportion
than would afterward be allowed but for once in a way it was allowed
Fulkerson said they could not expect to get their money back on that
first number anyway Seven of the illustrations were Beatons two or
three he got from practised hands the rest were the work of unknown
people which he had suggested and then related and adapted with
unfailing ingenuity to the different papers He handled the illustrations
with such sympathy as not to destroy their individual quality and that
indefinable charm which comes from good amateur work in whatever art He
rescued them from their weaknesses and errors while he left in them the
evidence of the pleasure with which a clever young man or a sensitive
girl or a refined woman had done them Inevitably from his manipulation
however the art of the number acquired homogeneity and there was
nothing casual in its appearance The result March eagerly owned was
better than the literary result and he foresaw that the number would be
sold and praised chiefly for its pictures Yet he was not ashamed of the
literature and he indulged his admiration of it the more freely because
he had not only not written it but in a way had not edited it To be
sure he had chosen all the material but he had not voluntarily put it
all together for that number it had largely put itself together as
every number of every magazine does and as it seems more and more to do
in the experience of every editor There had to be of course a story
and then a sketch of travel There was a literary essay and a social
essay there was a dramatic trifle very gay very light there was a
dashing criticism on the new pictures the new plays the new books the
new fashions and then there was the translation of a bit of vivid
Russian realism which the editor owed to Lindaus exploration of the
foreign periodicals left with him Lindau was himself a romanticist of
the Victor Hugo sort but he said this fragment of Dostoyevski was good
of its kind The poem was a bit of society verse with a backward look
into simpler and wholesomer experiences

Fulkerson was extremely proud of the number but he said it was too
goodtoo good from every point of view The cover was too good and the
paper was too good and that device of rough edges which got over the
objection to uncut leaves while it secured their aesthetic effect was a
thing that he trembled for though he rejoiced in it as a stroke of the
highest genius It had come from Beaton at the last moment as a
compromise when the problem of the vulgar croppiness of cut leaves and
the unpopularity of uncut leaves seemed to have no solution but suicide
Fulkerson was still morally crawling round on his hands and knees as he
said in abject gratitude at Beatons feet though he had his qualms his
questions and he declared that Beaton was the most inspired ass since
Balaams Were all asses of course he admitted in semiapology to
March but were no such asses as Beaton He said that if the tasteful
decorativeness of the thing did not kill it with the public outright its
literary excellence would give it the finishing stroke Perhaps that
might be overlooked in the impression of novelty which a first number
would give but it must never happen again He implored March to promise
that it should never happen again he said their only hope was in the
immediate cheapening of the whole affair It was bad enough to give the
public too much quantity for their money but to throw in such quality as
that was simply ruinous it must be stopped These were the expressions
of his intimate moods every front that he presented to the public wore a
glow of lofty of devout exultation His pride in the number gushed out
in fresh bursts of rhetoric to every one whom he could get to talk with
him about it He worked the personal kindliness of the press to the
utmost He did not mind making himself ridiculous or becoming a joke in
the good cause as he called it He joined in the applause when a
humorist at the club feigned to drop dead from his chair at Fulkersons
introduction of the topic and he went on talking that first number into
the surviving spectators He stood treat upon all occasions and he
lunched attaches of the press at all hours He especially befriended the
correspondents of the newspapers of other cities for as he explained to
March those fellows could give him any amount of advertising simply as
literary gossip Many of the fellows were ladies who could not be so
summarily asked out to lunch but Fulkersons ingenuity was equal to
every exigency and he contrived somehow to make each of these feel that
she had been possessed of exclusive information There was a moment when
March conjectured a willingness in Fulkerson to work Mrs March into the
advertising department by means of a tea to these ladies and their
friends which she should administer in his apartment but he did not
encourage Fulkerson to be explicit and the moment passed Afterward
when he told his wife about it he was astonished to find that she would
not have minded doing it for Fulkerson and he experienced another proof
of the bluntness of the feminine instincts in some directions and of the
personal favor which Fulkerson seemed to enjoy with the whole sex This
alone was enough to account for the willingness of these correspondents
to write about the first number but March accused him of sending it to
their addresses with boxes of Jacqueminot roses and Huyler candy

Fulkerson let him enjoy his joke He said that he would do that or
anything else for the good cause short of marrying the whole circle of
female correspondents

March was inclined to hope that if the first number had been made too
good for the country at large the more enlightened taste of metropolitan
journalism would invite a compensating favor for it in New York But
first Fulkerson and then the event proved him wrong In spite of the
quality of the magazine and in spite of the kindness which so many
newspaper men felt for Fulkerson the notices in the New York papers
seemed grudging and provisional to the ardor of the editor A merit in
the work was acknowledged and certain defects in it for which March had
trembled were ignored but the critics astonished him by selecting for
censure points which he was either proud of or had never noticed which
being now brought to his notice he still could not feel were faults He
owned to Fulkerson that if they had said so and so against it he could
have agreed with them but that to say thus and so was preposterous and
that if the advertising had not been adjusted with such generous
recognition of the claims of the different papers he should have known
the countingroom was at the bottom of it As it was he could only
attribute it to perversity or stupidity It was certainly stupid to
condemn a magazine novelty like Every Other Week for being novel and
to augur that if it failed it would fail through its departure from the
lines on which all the other prosperous magazines had been built was in
the last degree perverse and it looked malicious The fact that it was
neither exactly a book nor a magazine ought to be for it and not against
it since it would invade no other field it would prosper on no ground
but its own




XIV

The more March thought of the injustice of the New York press which had
not however attacked the literary quality of the number the more
bitterly he resented it and his wifes indignation superheated his own
Every Other Week had become a very personal affair with the whole
family the children shared their parents disgust Belle was outspoken
in her denunciations of a venal press Mrs March saw nothing but ruin
ahead and began tacitly to plan a retreat to Boston and an
establishment retrenched to the basis of two thousand a year She shed
some secret tears in anticipation of the privations which this must
involve but when Fulkerson came to see March rather late the night of
the publication day she nobly told him that if the worst came to the
worst she could only have the kindliest feeling toward him and should
not regard him as in the slightest degree responsible

Oh hold on hold on he protested You dont think weve made a
failure do you

Why of course she faltered while March remained gloomily silent

Well I guess well wait for the official count first Even New York
hasnt gone against us and I guess theres a majority coming down to
Harlem River that could sweep everything before it anyway

What do you mean Fulkerson March demanded sternly

Oh nothing Only the News Company has ordered ten thousand now and
you know we had to give them the first twenty on commission

What do you mean March repeated his wife held her breath

I mean that the first number is a booming success already and that its
going to a hundred thousand before it stops That unanimity and variety
of censure in the morning papers combined with the attractiveness of the
thing itself has cleared every stand in the city and now if the favor
of the country press doesnt turn the tide against us our fortunes
made The Marches remained dumb Why look here Didnt I tell you
those criticisms would be the making of us when they first began to turn
you blue this morning March

He came home to lunch perfectly sick said Mrs March and I wouldnt
let him go back again

Didnt I tell you so Fulkerson persisted

March could not remember that he had or that he had been anything but
incoherently and hysterically jocose over the papers but he said Yes
yesI think so

I knew it from the start said Fulkerson The only other person who
took those criticisms in the right spirit was Mother DryfoosIve just
been bolstering up the Dryfoos family She had them read to her by Mrs
Mandel and she understood them to be all the most flattering prophecies
of success Well I didnt read between the lines to that extent quite
but I saw that they were going to help us if there was anything in us
more than anything that could have been done And there was something in
us I tell you March that sevenshooting selfcocking donkey of a
Beaton has given us the greatest start Hes caught on like a mouse Hes
made the thing awfully chic its jimmy theres lots of dog about it
Hes managed that process so that the illustrations look as expensive as
firstclass woodcuts and theyre cheaper than chromos Hes put style
into the whole thing

Oh yes said March with eager meekness its Beaton thats done it

Fulkerson read jealousy of Beaton in Mrs Marchs face Beaton has given
us the start because his work appeals to the eye Theres no denying that
the pictures have sold this first number but I expect the literature of
this first number to sell the pictures of the second Ive been reading
it all over nearly since I found how the cat was jumping I was anxious
about it and I tell you old man its good Yes sir I was afraid
maybe you had got it too good with that Boston refinement of yours but
I reckon you havent Ill risk it I dont see how you got so much
variety into so few things and all of them palpitant all of em on the
keen jump with actuality

The mixture of American slang with the jargon of European criticism in
Fulkersons talk made March smile but his wife did not seem to notice it
in her exultation That is just what I say she broke in Its
perfectly wonderful I never was anxious about it a moment except as
you say Mr Fulkerson I was afraid it might be too good

They went on in an antiphony of praise till March said Really I dont
see whats left me but to strike for higher wages I perceive that Im
indispensable

Why old man youre coming in on the divvy you know said Fulkerson

They both laughed and when Fulkerson was gone Mrs March asked her
husband what a divvy was

Its a chicken before its hatched

No Truly

He explained and she began to spend the divvy

At Mrs Leightons Fulkerson gave Alma all the honor of the success he
told her mother that the girls design for the cover had sold every
number and Mrs Leighton believed him

Well Ah think Ah maght have some of the glory Miss Woodburn pouted
Where am Ah comin in

Youre coming in on the cover of the next number said Fulkerson
Were going to have your face there Miss Leightons going to sketch it
in He said this reckless of the fact that he had already shown them the
design of the second number which was Beatons weird bit of gascountry
landscape

Ah dont see why you dont wrahte the fiction for your magazine Mr
Fulkerson said the girl

This served to remind Fulkerson of something He turned to her father
Ill tell you what Colonel Woodburn I want Mr March to see some
chapters of that book of yours Ive been talking to him about it

I do not think it would add to the popularity of your periodical sir
said the Colonel with a stately pleasure in being asked My views of a
civilization based upon responsible slavery would hardly be acceptable to
your commercialized society

Well not as a practical thing of course Fulkerson admitted But as
something retrospective speculative I believe it would make a hit
Theres so much going on now about social questions I guess people would
like to read it

I do not know that my work is intended to amuse people said the
Colonel with some state

Mah goodness Ah only wish it WAS then said his daughter and she
added Yes Mr Fulkerson the Colonel will be very glad to submit
potions of his woak to yo edito We want to have some of the honaw
Perhaps we can say we helped to stop yo magazine if we didnt help to
stawt it

They all laughed at her boldness and Fulkerson said Itll take a good
deal more than that to stop Every Other Week The Colonels whole book
couldnt do it Then he looked unhappy for Colonel Woodburn did not
seem to enjoy his reassuring words but Miss Woodburn came to his rescue
You maght illustrate it with the potrait of the awthoris daughtaw if
its too late for the covah

Going to have that in every number Miss Woodburn he cried

Oh mah goodness she said with mock humility

Alma sat looking at her piquant head black unconsciously outlined
against the lamp as she sat working by the table Just keep still a
moment

She got her sketchblock and pencils and began to draw Fulkerson tilted
himself forward and looked over her shoulder he smiled outwardly
inwardly he was divided between admiration of Miss Woodburns arch beauty
and appreciation of the skill which reproduced it at the same time he
was trying to remember whether March had authorized him to go so far as
to ask for a sight of Colonel Woodburns manuscript He felt that he had
trenched upon Marchs province and he framed one apology to the editor
for bringing him the manuscript and another to the author for bringing
it back

Most Ah hold raght still like it was a photograph asked Miss Woodburn
Can Ah toak

Talk all you want said Alma squinting her eyes And you neednt be
either adamantine nor yetwooden

Oh ho very good of you Well if Ah can toakgo on Mr Fulkerson

Me talk I cant breathe till this thing is done sighed Fulkerson at
that point of his mental drama the Colonel was behaving rustily about the
return of his manuscript and he felt that he was looking his last on
Miss Woodburns profile

Is she getting it raght asked the girl

I dont know which is which said Fulkerson

Oh Ah hope Ah shall Ah dont want to go round feelin like a sheet of
papah half the time

You could rattle on just the same suggested Alma

Oh now Jost listen to that Mr Fulkerson Do you call that any way to
toak to people

You might know which you were by the color Fulkerson began and then
he broke off from the personal consideration with a business inspiration
and smacked himself on the knee We could print it in color

Mrs Leighton gathered up her sewing and held it with both hands in her
lap while she came round and looked critically at the sketch and the
model over her glasses Its very good Alma she said

Colonel Woodburn remained restively on his side of the table Of course
Mr Fulkerson you were jesting sir when you spoke of printing a sketch
of my daughter

Why I dont knowIf you object

I do sirdecidedly said the Colonel

Then that settles it of courseI only meant

Indeed it doesnt cried the girl Whos to know who its from Ahm
jost set on havin it printed Ahm going to appear as the head of
Slaveryin opposition to the head of Liberty

Therell be a revolution inside of fortyeight hours and well have the
Colonels system going wherever a copy of Every Other Week circulates
said Fulkerson

This sketch belongs to me Alma interposed Im not going to let it be
printed

Oh mah goodness said Miss Woodburn laughing goodhumoredly Thats
becose you were brought up to hate slavery

I should like Mr Beaton to see it said Mrs Leighton in a sort of
absent tone She added to Fulkerson I rather expected he might be in
tonight

Well if he comes well leave it to Beaton Fulkerson said with relief
in the solution and an anxious glance at the Colonel across the table
to see how he took that form of the joke Miss Woodburn intercepted his
glance and laughed and Fulkerson laughed too but rather forlornly

Alma set her lips primly and turned her head first on one side and then
on the other to look at the sketch I dont think well leave it to Mr
Beaton even if he comes

We left the other design for the cover to Beaton Fulkerson insinuated
I guess you neednt be afraid of him

Is it a question of my being afraid Alma asked she seemed coolly
intent on her drawing

Miss Leighton thinks he ought to be afraid of her Miss Woodburn
explained

Its a question of his courage then said Alma

Well I dont think there are many young ladies that Beatons afraid
of said Fulkerson giving himself the respite of this purely random
remark while he interrogated the faces of Mrs Leighton and Colonel
Woodburn for some light upon the tendency of their daughters words

He was not helped by Mrs Leightons saying with a certain anxiety I
dont know what you mean Mr Fulkerson

Well youre as much in the dark as I am myself then said Fulkerson
I suppose I meant that Beaton is ratherafavorite you know The
women like him

Mrs Leighton sighed and Colonel Woodburn rose and left the room

In the silence that followed Fulkerson looked from one lady to the other
with dismay I seem to have put my foot in it somehow he suggested
and Miss Woodburn gave a cry of laughter

Poo Mr Fulkerson Poo Mr Fulkerson Papa thoat you wanted him to
go

Wanted him to go repeated Fulkerson

We always mention Mr Beaton when we want to get rid of papa

Well it seems to me that I have noticed that he didnt take much
interest in Beaton as a general topic But I dont know that I ever saw
it drive him out of the room before

Well he isnt always so bad said Miss Woodburn But it was a case of
hate at first sight and it seems to be growin on papa

Well I can understand that said Fulkerson The impulse to destroy
Beaton is something that everybody has to struggle against at the start

I must say Mr Fulkerson said Mrs Leighton in the tremor through
which she nerved herself to differ openly with any one she liked I
never had to struggle with anything of the kind in regard to Mr Beaton
He has always been most respectful andandconsiderate with me
whatever he has been with others

Well of course Mrs Leighton Fulkerson came back in a soothing tone
But you see youre the rule that proves the exception I was speaking of
the way men felt about Beaton Its different with ladies I just said
so

Is it always different Alma asked lifting her head and her hand from
her drawing and staring at it absently

Fulkerson pushed both his hands through his whiskers Look here Look
here he said Wont somebody start some other subject We havent had
the weather up yet have we Or the opera What is the matter with a few
remarks about politics

Why Ah thoat you lahked to toak about the staff of yo magazine said
Miss Woodburn

Oh I do said Fulkerson But not always about the same member of it
He gets monotonous when he doesnt get complicated Ive just come round
from the Marches he added to Mrs Leighton

I suppose theyve got thoroughly settled in their apartment by this
time Mrs Leighton said something like this whenever the Marches were
mentioned At the bottom of her heart she had not forgiven them for not
taking her rooms she had liked their looks so much and she was always
hoping that they were uncomfortable or dissatisfied she could not help
wanting them punished a little

Well yes as much as they ever will be Fulkerson answered The
Boston style is pretty different you know and the Marches are
oldfashioned folks and I reckon they never went in much for bricabrac
Theyve put away nine or ten barrels of dragon candlesticks but they
keep finding new ones

Their landlady has just joined our class said Alma Isnt her name
Green She happened to see my copy of Every Other Week and said she
knew the editor and told me

Well its a little world said Fulkerson You seem to be touching
elbows with everybody Just think of your having had our head translator
for a model

Ah think that your whole publication revolves aroand the Leighton
family said Miss Woodburn

Thats pretty much so Fulkerson admitted Anyhow the publisher seems
disposed to do so

Are you the publisher I thought it was Mr Dryfoos said Alma

It is

Oh

The tone and the word gave Fulkerson a discomfort which he promptly
confessed Missed again

The girls laughed and he regained something of his lost spirits and
smiled upon their gayety which lasted beyond any apparent reason for it

Miss Woodburn asked And is Mr Dryfoos senio anything like ouah Mr
Dryfoos

Not the least

But hes jost as exemplary

Yes in his way

Well Ah wish Ah could see all those pinks of puffection togethah
once

Why look here Ive been thinking Id celebrate a little when the old
gentleman gets back Have a little suppersomething of that kind How
would you like to let me have your parlors for it Mrs Leighton You
ladies could stand on the stairs and have a peep at us in the bunch

Oh mah What a privilege And will Miss Alma be there with the othah
contributors Ah shall jost expah of envy

She wont be there in person said Fulkerson but shell be
represented by the head of the art department

Mah goodness And wholl the head of the publishing department
represent

He can represent you said Alma

Well Ah want to be represented someho

Well have the banquet the night before you appear on the cover of our
fourth number said Fulkerson

Ah thoat that was doubly fobidden said Miss Woodburn By the stern
parent and the envious awtust

Well get Beaton to get round them somehow I guess we can trust him to
manage that

Mrs Leighton sighed her resentment of the implication

I always feel that Mr Beaton doesnt do himself justice she began

Fulkerson could not forego the chance of a joke Well maybe he would
rather temper justice with mercy in a case like his This made both the
younger ladies laugh I judge this is my chance to get off with my
life he added and he rose as he spoke Mrs Leighton I am about the
only man of my sex who doesnt thirst for Beatons blood most of the
time But I know him and I dont Hes more kinds of a good fellow than
people generally understand He doesnt wear his heart upon his
sleevenot his ulster sleeve anyway You can always count me on your
side when its a question of finding Beaton not guilty if hell leave the
State

Alma set her drawing against the wall in rising to say goodnight to
Fulkerson He bent over on his stick to look at it Well its
beautiful he sighed with unconscious sincerity

Alma made him a courtesy of mock modesty Thanks to Miss Woodburn

Oh no All she had to do was simply to stay put

Dont you think Ah might have improved it if Ah had looked better the
girl asked gravely

Oh you couldnt said Fulkerson and he went off triumphant in their
applause and their cries of Which which

Mrs Leighton sank deep into an accusing gloom when at last she found
herself alone with her daughter I dont know what you are thinking
about Alma Leighton If you dont like Mr Beaton

I dont

You dont You know better than that You know that you did care for
him

Oh thats a very different thing Thats a thing that can be got over

Got over repeated Mrs Leighton aghast

Of course it can Dont be romantic mamma People get over dozens of
such fancies They even marry for love two or three times

Never cried her mother doing her best to feel shocked and at last
looking it

Her looking it had no effect upon Alma You can easily get over caring
for people but you cant get over liking themif you like them because
they are sweet and good Thats what lasts I was a simple goose and he
imposed upon me because he was a sophisticated goose Now the case is
reversed

He does care for you now You can see it Why do you encourage him to
come here

I dont said Alma I will tell him to keep away if you like But
whether he comes or goes it will be the same

Not to him Alma He is in love with you

He has never said so

And you would really let him say so when you intend to refuse him

I cant very well refuse him till he does say so

This was undeniable Mrs Leighton could only demand in an awful tone
May I ask whyif you cared for him and I know you care for him still
you will refuse him

Alma laughed Becausebecause Im wedded to my Art and Im not going
to commit bigamy whatever I do

Alma

Well then because I dont like himthat is I dont believe in him
and dont trust him Hes fascinating but hes false and hes fickle He
cant help it I dare say

And you are perfectly hard Is it possible that you were actually
pleased to have Mr Fulkerson tease you about Mr Dryfoos

Oh goodnight now mamma This is becoming personal
