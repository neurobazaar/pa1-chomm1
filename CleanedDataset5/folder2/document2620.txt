Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

POEMS OF LOVE




EROS

The sense of the world is short 
Long and various the report 
To love and be beloved
Men and gods have not outlearned it
And how oft soeer theyve turned it
Tis not to be improved

Ralph Waldo Emerson 18031882






NOW WHAT IS LOVE






NOW WHAT IS LOVE

Now what is Love I pray thee tell
It is that fountain and that well
Where pleasure and repentance dwell
It is perhaps the sauncing bell
That tolls all into heaven or hell
And this is Love as I hear tell

Yet what is Love I prithee say
It is a work on holiday
It is December matched with May
When lusty bloods in fresh array
Hear ten months after of the play
And this is Love as I hear say

Yet what is Love good shepherd sain
It is a sunshine mixed with rain
It is a toothache or like pain
It is a game where none hath gain
The lass saith no yet would full fain
And this is Love as I hear sain

Yet shepherd what is Love I pray
It is a yes it is a nay
A pretty kind of sporting fray
It is a thing will soon away
Then nymphs take vantage while ye may
And this is Love as I hear say

Yet what is Love good shepherd show
A thing that creeps it cannot go
A prize that passeth to and fro
A thing for one a thing for moe
And he that proves shall find it so
And shepherd this is Love I trow

Walter Raleigh 15521618


WOOING SONG
From Christs Victory

Love is the blossom where there blows
Every thing that lives or grows
Love doth make the Heavens to move
And the Sun doth burn in love
Love the strong and weak doth yoke
And makes the ivy climb the oak
Under whose shadows lions wild
Softened by love grow tame and mild
Love no medicine can appease
He burns fishes in the seas
Not all the skill his wounds can stench
Not all the sea his fire can quench
Love did make the bloody spear
Once a leavy coat to wear
While in his leaves there shrouded lay
Sweet birds for love that sing and play
And of all loves joyful flame
I the bud and blossom am
Only bend thy knee to me
Thy wooing shall thy winning be

See see the flowers that below
Now as fresh as morning blow
And of all the virgin rose
That as bright Aurora shows
How they all unleaved die
Losing their virginity
Like unto a summer shade
But now born and now they fade
Every thing doth pass away
There is danger in delay
Come come gather then the rose
Gather it or it you lose
All the sand of Tagus shore
Into my bosom casts his ore
All the valleys swimming corn
To my house is yearly borne
Every grape of every vine
Is gladly bruised to make me wine
While ten thousand kings as proud
To carry up my train have bowed
And a world of ladies send me
In my chambers to attend me
All the stars in Heaven that shine
And ten thousand more are mine
Only bend thy knee to me
Thy wooing shall thy winning be

Giles Fletcher 15491611


ROSALINDS MADRIGAL
From Rosalind

Love in my bosom like a bee
Doth suck his sweet
Now with his wings he plays with me
Now with his feet
Within mine eyes he makes his nest
His bed amidst my tender breast
My kisses are his daily feast
And yet he robs me of my rest
Ah wanton will ye

And if I sleeps then percheth he
With pretty flight
And makes his pillow of my knee
The livelong night
Strike I my lute he tunes the string
He music plays if so I sing
He lends me every lovely thing
Yet cruel he my heart doth sting
Whist wanton still ye

Else I with roses every day
Will whip you hence
And bind you when you long to play
For your offence
Ill shut mine eyes to keep you in
Ill make you fast it for your sin
Ill count your power not worth a pin
 Alas what hereby shall I win
If he gainsay me

What if I beat the wanton boy
With many a rod
He will repay me with annoy
Because a god
Then sit thou safely on my knee
Then let thy bower my bosom be
Lurk in mine eyes I like of thee
O Cupid so thou pity me
Spare not but play thee

Thomas Lodge 15581625


SONG
From Hymens Triumph

Love is a sickness full of woes
All remedies refusing
A plant that with most cutting grows
Most barren with best using
Why so
More we enjoy it more it dies
If not enjoyed it sighing cries 
Heigh ho

Love is a torment of the mind
A tempest everlasting
And Jove hath made it of a kind
Not well nor full nor fasting
Why so
More we enjoy it more it dies
If not enjoyed it sighing cries 
Heigh ho

Samuel Daniel 15621619


LOVES PERJURIES
From Loves Labors Lost

On a day alack the day
Love whose month is ever May
Spied a blossom passing fair
Playing in the wanton air
Through the velvet leaves the wind
All unseen gan passage find
That the lover sick to death
Wished himself the heavens breath
Air quoth he thy cheeks may blow
Air would I might triumph so
But alack my hand is sworn
Neer to pluck thee from thy thorn
Vow alack for youth unmeet
Youth so apt to pluck a sweet
Do not call it sin in me
That I am forsworn for thee
Thou for whom een Jove would swear
Juno but an Ethiope were
And deny himself for Jove
Turning mortal for thy love

William Shakespeare 15641616


VENUS RUNAWAY
From The Hue and Cry After Cupid

Beauties have ye seen this toy
Called Love a little boy
Almost naked wanton blind
Cruel now and then as kind
If he be amongst ye say
He is Venus runaway

She that will but now discover
Where the winged wag doth hover
Shall tonight receive a kiss
How or where herself would wish
But who brings him to his mother
Shall have that kiss and another

He hath marks about him plenty
You shall know him among twenty
All his body is a fire
And his breath a flame entire
That being shot like lightning in
Wounds the heart but not the skin

At his sight the sun hath turned
Neptune in the waters burned
Hell hath felt a greater heat
Jove himself forsook his seat
From the centre to the sky
Are his trophies reared high

Wings he hath which though ye clip
He will leap from lip to lip
Over liver lights and heart
But not stay in any part
But if chance his arrow misses
He will shoot himself in kisses

He doth bear a golden bow
And a quiver hanging low
Full of arrows that outbrave
Dians shafts where if he have
Any head more sharp than other
With that first he strikes his mother

Still the fairest are his fuel
When his days are to be cruel
Lovers hearts are all his food
And his baths their warmest blood
Naught but wounds his hands doth season
And he hates none like to Reason

Trust him not his words though sweet
Seldom with his heart do meet
All his practice is deceit
Every gift it is a bait
Not a kiss but poison bears
And most treason in his tears

Idle minutes are his reign
Then the straggler makes his gain
By presenting maids with toys
And would have ye think them joys
Tis the ambition of the elf
To have all childish as himself

If by these ye please to know him
Beauties be not nice but show him
Though ye had a will to hide him
Now we hope yell not abide him
Since you hear his falser play
And that hes Venus runaway

Ben Jonson 15731637


WHAT IS LOVE
From The Captain

Tell me dearest what is love
Tis a lightning from above
Tis an arrow tis a fire
Tis a boy they call Desire
Tis a grave
Gapes to have
Those poor fools that long to prove

Tell me more are women true
Yes some are and some as you
Some are willing some are strange
Since you men first taught to change
And till troth
Be in both
All shall love to love anew

Tell me more yet can they grieve
Yes and sicken sore but live
And be wise and delay
When you men are wise as they
Then I see
Faith will be
Never till they both believe

John Fletcher 15791625


LOVES EMBLEMS
From Valentinian

Now the lusty spring is seen
Golden yellow gaudy blue
Daintily invite the view
Everywhere on every green
Roses blushing as they blow
And enticing men to pull
Lilies whiter than the snow
Woodbines of sweet honey full
All loves emblems and all cry
Ladies if not plucked we die

Yet the lusty spring hath stayed
Blushing red and purest white
Daintily to love invite
Every woman every maid
Cherries kissing as they grow
And inviting men to taste
Apples even ripe below
Winding gently to the waist
All loves emblems and all cry
Ladies if not plucked we die

John Fletcher 15791625


THE POWER OF LOVE
From Valentinian

Hear ye ladies that despise
What the mighty Love has done
Fear examples and be wise
Fair Callisto was a nun
Leda sailing on the stream
To deceive the hopes of man
Love accounting but a dream
Doted on a silver swan
Danae in a brazen tower
Where no love was loved a shower

Hear ye ladies that are coy
What the mighty Love can do
Fear the fierceness of the boy
The chaste Moon he makes to woo
Vesta kindling holy fires
Circled round about with spies
Never dreaming loose desires
Doting at the altar dies
Ilion in a short hour higher
He can build and once more fire

John Fletcher 15791625


ADVICE TO A LOVER

The sea hath many thousand sands
The sun hath motes as many
The sky is full of stars and Love
As full of woes as any
Believe me that do know the elf
And make no trial by thyself

It is in truth a pretty toy
For babes to play withal
But O the honies of our youth
Are oft our ages gall
Selfproof in time will make thee know
He was a prophet told thee so

A prophet that Cassandralike
Tells truth without belief
For headstrong Youth will run his race
Although his goal be grief 
Loves Martyr when his heat is past
Proves Cares Confessor at the last

LOVES HOROSCOPE

Love brave Virtues younger brother
Erst hath made my heart a mother
She consults the anxious spheres
To calculate her young sons years
She asks if sad or saving powers
Gave omen to his infant hours
She asks each star that then stood by
If poor Love shall live or die

Ah my heart is that the way
Are these the beams that rule thy day
Thou knowst a face in whose each look
Beauty lays ope Loves fortunebook
On whose fair revolutions wait
The obsequious motions of Loves fate
Ah my heart her eyes and she
Have taught thee new astrology
Howeer Loves native hours were set
Whatever starry synod met
Tis in the mercy of her eye
If poor Love shall live or die

If those sharp rays putting on
Points of death bid Love be gone 
Though the heavens in council sate
To crown an uncontrolled fate
Though their best aspects twined upon
The kindest constellation
Cast amorous glances on its birth
And whispered the confederate earth
To pave his paths with all the good
That warms the bed of youth and blood 
Love has no plea against her eye
Beauty frowns and Love must die

But if her milder influence move
And gild the hopes of humble Love 
Though heavens inauspicious eye
Lay black on Loves nativity
Though every diamond in Joves crown
Fixed his forehead to a frown 
Her eye a strong appeal can give
Beauty smiles and Love shall live

O if Love shall live O where
But in her eye or in her ear
In her breast or in her breath
Shall I hide poor Love from death
For in the life aught else can give
Love shall die although he live

Or if Love shall die O where
But in her eye or in her ear
In her breath or in her breast
Shall I build his funeral nest
While Love shall thus entombed lie
Love shall live although he die

Richard Crashaw 16131649


AH HOW SWEET IT IS TO LOVE
From Tyrannic Love

Ah how sweet it is to love
Ah how gay is young Desire
And what pleasing pains we prove
When we first approach Loves fire
Pains of Love be sweeter far
Than all other pleasures are

Sighs which are from lovers blown
Do but gently heave the heart
Even the tears they shed alone
Cure like trickling balm their smart
Lovers when they lose their breath
Bleed away in easy death

Love and Time with reverence use
Treat them like a parting friend
Nor the golden gifts refuse
Which in youth sincere they send
For each year their price is more
And they less simple than before

Love like springtides full and high
Swells in every youthful vein
But each tide does less supply
Till they quite shrink in again
If a flow in age appear
Tis but rain and runs not clear

John Dryden 16311700


SONG

Love still has something of the sea
From whence his Mother rose
No time his slaves from doubt can free
Nor give their thoughts repose

They are becalmed in clearest days
And in rough weather tossed
They wither under cold delays
Or are in tempests lost

One while they seem to touch the port
Then straight into the main
Some angry wind in cruel sport
The vessel drives again

At first Disdain and Pride they fear
Which if they chance to scape
Rivals and Falsehood soon appear
In a more dreadful shape

By such degrees to joy they come
And are so long withstood
So slowly they receive the sum
It hardly does them good

Tis cruel to prolong a pain
And to defer a joy
Believe me gentle Celemene
Offends the winged boy

An hundred thousand oaths your fears
Perhaps would not remove
And if I gazed a thousand years
I could no deeper love

Charles Sedley 16391710


THE VINE
From Sunday Up the River

The wine of Love is music
And the feast of Love is song
And when Love sits down to the banquet
Love sits long

Sits long and arises drunken
But not with the feast and the wine
He reeleth with his own heart
That great rich Vine

James Thomson 18341882


SONG

Fain would I change that note
To which fond love hath charmed me
Long long to sing by rote
Fancying that that harmed me
Yet when this thought doth come 
Love is the perfect sum
Of all delight
I have no other choice
Either for pen or voice
To sing or write

O love they wrong thee much
That say thy sweet is bitter
When thy rich fruit is such
As nothing can be sweeter
Fair house of joy and bliss
Where truest pleasure is
I do adore thee
I know thee what thou art
I serve thee with my heart
And fall before thee

CUPID STUNG

Cupid once upon a bed
Of roses laid his weary head
Luckless urchin not to see
Within the leaves a slumbering bee
The bee awaked  with anger wild
The bee awaked and stung the child
Loud and piteous are his cries
To Venus quick he runs he flies
Oh Mother I am wounded through 
I die with pain  in sooth I do
Stung by some little angry thing
Some serpent on a tiny wing 
A bee it was  for once I know
I heard a rustic call it so
Thus he spoke and she the while
Heard him with a soothing smile
Then said My infant if so much
Thou feel the little wild bees touch
How must the heart ah Cupid be
The hapless heart thats stung by thee

Thomas Moore 17791852


CUPID DROWNED

Tother day as I was twining
Roses for a crown to dine in
What of all things mid the heap
Should I light on fast asleep
But the little desperate elf
The tiny traitor Love himself
By the wings I picked him up
Like a bee and in a cup
Of my wine I plunged and sank him
Then what dye think I did  I drank him
Faith I thought him dead Not he
There he lives with tenfold glee
And now this moment with his wings
I feel him tickling my heartstrings

Leigh Hunt 17841859


SONG
From The Heir of Vironi

Oh say not womans love is bought
With vain and empty treasure
Oh say not womans heart is caught
By every idle pleasure
When first her gentle bosom knows
Loves flame it wanders never
Deep in her heart the passion glows
She loves and loves for ever

Oh say not womans false as fair
That like the bee she ranges
Still seeking flowers more sweet and rare
As fickle fancy changes
Ah no the love that first can warm
Will leave her bosom never
No second passion eer can charm
She loves and loves for ever

Isaac Pocock 17821835


IN THE DAYS OF OLD
From Crotchet Castle

In the days of old
Lovers felt true passion
Deeming years of sorrow
By a smile repaid
Now the charms of gold
Spells of pride and fashion
Bid them say Goodmorrow
To the bestloved Maid

Through the forests wild
Oer the mountains lonely
They were never weary
Honor to pursue
If the damsel smiled
Once in seven years only
All their wanderings dreary
Ample guerdon knew

Now one days caprice
Weighs down years of smiling
Youthful hearts are rovers
Love is bought and sold
Fortunes gifts may cease
Love is less beguiling
Wiser were the lovers
In the days of old

Thomas Love Peacock 17851866


SONG

How delicious is the winning
Of a kiss at Loves beginning
When two mutual hearts are sighing
For the knot theres no untying

Yet remember midst your wooing
Love has bliss but Love has ruing
Other smiles may make you fickle
Tears for other charms may trickle

Love he comes and Love he tarries
Just as fate or fancy carries
Longest stays when sorest chidden
Laughs and flies when pressed and bidden

Bind the sea to slumber stilly
Bind its odor to the lily
Bind the aspen neer to quiver
Then bind Love to last forever

Loves a fire that needs renewal
Of fresh beauty for its fuel
Loves wing moults when caged and captured
Only free he soars enraptured

Can you keep the bee from ranging
Or the ringdoves neck from changing
No nor fettered Love from dying
In the knot theres no untying

Thomas Campbell 17771844


STANZAS

Could Love for ever
Run like a river
And Times endeavor
Be tried in vain 
No other pleasure
With this could measure
And like a treasure
Wed hug the chain
But since our sighing
Ends not in dying
And formed for flying
Love plumes his wing
Then for this reason
Lets love a season
But let that season
Be only Spring

When lovers parted
Feel brokenhearted
And all hopes thwarted
Expect to die
A few years older
Ah how much colder
They might behold her
For whom they sigh
When linked together
In every weather
They pluck Loves feather
From out his wing 
Hell stay for ever
But sadly shiver
Without his plumage
When past the Spring

Like Chiefs of Faction
His life is action 
A formal paction
That curbs his reign
Obscures his glory
Despot no more he
Such territory
Quits with disdain
Still still advancing
With banners glancing
His power enhancing
He must move on 
Repose but cloys him
Retreat destroys him
Love brooks not a
Degraded throne

Wait not fond lover
Till years are over
And then recover
As from a dream
While each bewailing
The others failing
With wrath and railing
All hideous seem 
While first decreasing
Yet not quite ceasing
Wait not till teasing
All passion blight
If once diminished
Loves reign is finished 
Then part in friendship 
And bid goodnight

So shall Affection
To recollection
The dear connection
Bring back with joy
You had not waited
Till tired or hated
Your passions sated
Began to cloy
Your last embraces
Leave no cold traces 
The same fond faces
As through the past
And eyes the mirrors
Of your sweet errors
Reflect but rapture 
Not least though last

True separations
Ask more than patience
What desperations
From such have risen
But yet remaining
What ist but chaining
Hearts which once waning
Beat gainst their prison
Time can but cloy love
And use destroy love
The winged boy Love
Is but for boys 
Youll find it torture
Though sharper shorter
To wean and not
Wear out your joys

George Gordon Byron 17881824

But mind ye this the halftaen kiss
The first fond fain tear
Is heaven kens fu sweet amends
An tints o heaven here

When two leal hearts in fondness meet
Lifes tempests howl in vain
The very tears o love are sweet
When paid with tears again

Shall hapless prudence shake its pow
Shall cauldrife caution fear
Oh dinna dinna droun the lowe
That lights a heaven here

William Thom 17981848


LOVE WILL FIND OUT THE WAY

Over the mountains
And over the waves
Under the fountains
And under the graves
Under floods that are deepest
Which Neptune obey
Over rocks that are steepest
Love will find out the way

Where there is no place
For the glowworm to lie
Where there is no space
For receipt of a fly
Where the midge dares not venture
Lest herself fast she lay
If Love come he will enter
And find out the way

You may esteem him
A child for his might
Or you may deem him
A coward from his flight
But if she whom Love doth honor
Be concealed from the day
Set a thousand guards upon her
Love will find out the way

Some think to lose him
By having him confined
And some do suppose him
Poor thing to be blind
But if neer so close ye wall him
Do the best that you may
Blind Love if so ye call him
Will find out the way

You may train the eagle
To stoop to your fist
Or you may inveigle
The phoenix of the east
The tiger ye may move her
To give over her prey
But youll neer stop a lover 
He will find out the way

A WOMANS SHORTCOMINGS

She has laughed as softly as if she sighed
She has counted six and over
Of a purse well filled and a heart well tried 
Oh each a worthy lover
They give her time for her soul must slip
Where the world has set the grooving
She will lie to none with her fair red lip
But love seeks truer loving

She trembles her fan in a sweetness dumb
As her thoughts were beyond recalling
With a glance for one and a glance for some
From her eyelids rising and falling
Speaks common words with a blushful air
Hears bold words unreproving
But her silence says  what she never will swear 
And love seeks better loving

Go lady lean to the nightguitar
And drop a smile to the bringer
Then smile as sweetly when he is far
At the voice of an indoor singer
Bask tenderly beneath tender eyes
Glance lightly on their removing
And join new vows to old perjuries 
But dare not call it loving

Unless you can think when the song is done
No other is soft in the rhythm
Unless you can feel when left by One
That all men else go with him
Unless you can know when unpraised by his breath
That your beauty itself wants proving
Unless you can swear For life for death 
Oh fear to call it loving

Unless you can muse in a crowd all day
On the absent face that fixed you
Unless you can love as the angels may
With the breadth of heaven betwixt you
Unless you can dream that his faith is fast
Through behoving and unbehoving
Unless you can die when the dream is past 
Oh never call it loving

Elizabeth Barrett Browning 18061861


LOVE HATH A LANGUAGE
From To My Son

Love hath a language for all years 
Fond hieroglyphs obscure and old 
Wherein the heart reads writ in tears
The tale which never yet was told

Love hath his meter too to trace
Those bounds which never yet were given 
To measure that which mocks at space
Is deep as death and high as heaven

Love hath his treasure hoards to pay
True faith or goodly service done 
Dear priceless nothings which outweigh
All riches that the sun shines on

Helen Selina Sheridan 18071867


SONG
From Maud

O let the solid ground
Not fail beneath my feet
Before my life has found
What some have found so sweet
Then let come what come may
What matter if I go mad
I shall have had my day

Let the sweet heavens endure
Not close and darken above me
Before I am quite quite sure
That there is one to love me
Then let come what come may
To a life that has been so sad
I shall have had my day

Alfred Tennyson 18091892


AMATURUS

Somewhere beneath the sun
These quivering heartstrings prove it
Somewhere there must be one
Made for this soul to move it
Some one that hides her sweetness
From neighbors whom she slights
Nor can attain completeness
Nor give her heart its rights
Some one whom I could court
With no great change of manner
Still holding reasons fort
Though waving fancys banner
A lady not so queenly
As to disdain my hand
Yet born to smile serenely
Like those that rule the land
Noble but not too proud
With soft hair simply folded
And bright face crescentbrowed
And throat by Muses moulded
And eyelids lightly falling
On little glistening seas
Deepcalm when gales are brawling
Though stirred by every breeze
Swift voice like flight of dove
Through minsterarches floating
With sudden turns when love
Gets overnear to doting
Keen lips that shape soft sayings
Like crystals of the snow
With pretty halfbetrayings
Of things one may not know
Fair hand whose touches thrill
Like golden rod of wonder
Which Hermes wields at will
Spirit and flesh to sunder
Light foot to press the stirrup
In fearlessness and glee
Or dance till finches chirrup
And stars sink to the sea

Forth Love and find this maid
Wherever she be hidden
Speak Love be not afraid
But plead as thou art bidden
And say that he who taught thee
His yearning want and pain
Too dearly dearly bought thee
To part with thee in vain

William JohnsonCory 18231892


THE SURFACE AND THE DEPTHS

Love took my life and thrilled it
Through all its strings
Played round my mind and filled it
With sound of wings
But to my heart he never came
To touch it with his golden flame

Therefore it is that singing
I do rejoice
Nor heed the slow years bringing
A harsher voice
Because the songs which he has sung
Still leave the untouched singer young

But whom in fuller fashion
The Master sways
For him swiftwinged with passion
Fleet the brief days
Betimes the enforced accents come
And leave him ever after dumb

Lewis Morris 18331907


A BALLAD OF DREAMLAND

I hid my heart in a nest of roses
Out of the suns way hidden apart
In a softer bed then the soft white snows is
Under the roses I hid my heart
Why would it sleep not why should it start
When never a leaf of the rosetree stirred
What made sleep flutter his wings and part
Only the song of a secret bird

Lie still I said for the winds wing closes
And mild leaves muffle the keen suns dart
Lie still for the wind on the warm seas dozes
And the wind is unquieter yet than thou art
Does a thought in thee still as a thorns wound smart
Does the fang still fret thee of hope deferred
What bids the lips of thy sleep dispart
Only the song of a secret bird

The green lands name that a charm encloses
It never was writ in the travellers chart
And sweet on its trees as the fruit that grows is
It never was sold in the merchants mart
The swallows of dreams through its dim fields dart
And sleeps are the tunes in its treetops heard
No hounds note wakens the wildwood hart
Only the song of a secret bird

ENVOI
In the world of dreams I have chosen my part
To sleep for a season and hear no word
Of true loves truth or of light loves art
Only the song of a secret bird

Algernon Charles Swinburne 18371909


ENDYMION

The rising moon has hid the stars
Her level rays like golden bars
Lie on the landscape green
With shadows brown between

And silver white the river gleams
As if Diana in her dreams
Had dropped her silver bow
Upon the meadows low

On such a tranquil night as this
She woke Endymion with a kiss
When sleeping in the grove
He dreamed not of her love

Like Dians kiss unasked unsought
Love gives itself but is not bought
Nor voice nor sound betrays
Its deep impassioned gaze

It comes  the beautiful the free
The crown of all humanity 
In silence and alone
To seek the elected one

It lifts the boughs whose shadows deep
Are lifes oblivion the souls sleep
And kisses the closed eyes
Of him who slumbering lies

O weary hearts O slumbering eyes
O drooping souls whose destinies
Are fraught with fear and pain
Ye shall be loved again

No one is so accursed by fate
No one so utterly desolate
But some heart though unknown
Responds unto his own

Responds  as if with unseen wings
An angel touched its quivering strings
And whispers in its song
Where hast thou stayed so long

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow 18071882


FATE

Two shall be born the whole wide world apart
And speak in different tongues and have no thought
Each of the others being and no heed
And these oer unknown seas to unknown lands
Shall cross escaping wreck defying death
And all unconsciously shape every act
And bend each wandering step to this one end 
That one day out of darkness they shall meet
And read lifes meaning in each others eyes

And two shall walk some narrow way of life
So nearly side by side that should one turn
Ever so little space to left or right
They needs must stand acknowledged face to face
And yet with wistful eyes that never meet
And groping hands that never clasp and lips
Calling in vain to ears that never hear
They seek each other all their weary days
And die unsatisfied  and this is Fate

Susan Marr Spalding 18411908


GIVE ALL TO LOVE

Give all to love
Obey thy heart
Friends kindred days
Estate good fame
Plans credit and the Muse 
Nothing refuse

Tis a brave master
Let it have scope
Follow it utterly
Hope beyond hope
High and more high
It dives into noon
With wing unspent

Untold intent
But it is a god
Knows its own path
And the outlets of the sky

It was never for the mean
It requireth courage stout
Souls above doubt
Valor unbending
It will reward 
They shall return
More than they were
And ever ascending

Leave all for love
Yet hear me yet
One word more thy heart behoved
One pulse more of firm endeavor 
Keep thee today
Tomorrow forever
Free as an Arab
Of thy beloved

Cling with life to the maid
But when the surprise
First vague shadow of surmise
Flits across her bosom young
Of a joy apart from thee
Free be she fancyfree
Nor thou detain her vestures hem
Nor the palest rose she flung
From her summer diadem

Though thou loved her as thyself
As a self of purer clay
Though her parting dims the day
Stealing grace from all alive
Heartily know
When halfgods go
The gods arrive

Ralph Waldo Emerson 18031882


O LOVE IS NOT A SUMMER MOOD

O love is not a summer mood
Nor flying phantom of the brain
Nor youthful fever of the blood
Nor dream nor fate nor circumstance
Love is not born of blinded chance
Nor bred in simple ignorance

Love is the flower of maidenhood
Love is the fruit of mortal pain
And she hath winter in her blood
True love is steadfast as the skies
And once alight she never flies
And love is strong and love is wise

Richard Watson Gilder 18441909


WHEN WILL LOVE COME

Some find Love late some find him soon
Some with the rose in May
Some with the nightingale in June
And some when skies are gray
Love comes to some with smiling eyes
And comes with tears to some
For some Love sings for some Love sighs
For some Loves lips are dumb

How will you come to me fair Love
Will you come late or soon
With sad or smiling skies above
By light of sun or moon
Will you be sad will you be sweet
Sing sigh Love or be dumb
Will it be summer when we meet
Or autumn ere you come

Pakenham Beatty 1855


AWAKE MY HEART

Awake my heart to be loved awake awake

The darkness silvers away the morn doth break
It leaps in the sky unrisen lustres slake
The oertaken moon Awake O heart awake

She too that loveth awaketh and hopes for thee
Her eyes already have sped the shades that flee
Already they watch the path thy feet shall take
Awake O heart to be loved awake awake

And if thou tarry from her  if this could be 
She cometh herself O heart to be loved to thee
For thee would unashamed herself forsake
Awake to be loved my heart awake awake

Awake The land is scattered with light and see
Uncanopied sleep is flying from field and tree
And blossoming boughs of April in laughter shake
Awake O heart to be loved awake awake

Lo all things wake and tarry and look for thee
She looketh and saith O sun now bring him to me
Come more adored O adored for his comings sake
And awake my heart to be loved awake awake

Robert Bridges 18441930


THE SECRET

Nightingales warble about it
All night under blossom and star
The wild swan is dying without it
And the eagle crieth afar
The sun he doth mount but to find it
Searching the green earth oer
But more doth a mans heart mind it 
O more more more

Over the gray leagues of ocean
The infinite yearneth alone
The forests with wandering emotion
The thing they know not intone
Creation arose but to see it
A million lamps in the blue
But a lover he shall be it
If one sweet maid is true

George Edward Woodberry 18551930


THE ROSE OF STARS

When Love our great Immortal
Put on mortality
And down from Edens portal
Brought this sweet life to be
At the sublime archangel
He laughed with veiled eyes
For he bore within his bosom
The seed of Paradise

He hid it in his bosom
And there such warmth it found
It brake in bud and blossom
And the rose fell on the ground
As the green light on the prairie
As the red light on the sea
Through fragrant belts of summer
Came this sweet life to be

And the grave archangel seeing
Spread his mighty wings for flight
But the glow hung round him fleeing
Like the rose of an Arctic night
And sadly moving heavenward
By Venus and by Mars
He heard the joyful planets
Hail Earth the Rose of Stars

George Edward Woodberry 18551930


SONG OF EROS
From Agathon

When love in the faint heart trembles
And the eyes with tears are wet
O tell me what resembles
Thee young Regret
Violets with dewdrops drooping
Lilies oerfull of gold
Roses in June rains stooping
That weep for the cold
Are like thee young Regret

Bloom violets lilies and roses
But what young Desire
Like thee when love discloses
Thy heart of fire
The wild swan unreturning
The eagle alone with the sun
The longwinged stormgulls burning
Seaward when day is done
Are like thee young Desire

George Edward Woodberry 18551930


LOVE IS STRONG

A viewless thing is the wind
But its strength is mightier far
Than a phalanxed host in battle line
Than the limbs of a Samson are

And a viewless thing is Love
And a name that vanisheth
But her strength is the winds wild strength above
For she conquers shame and Death

Richard Burton 1861


LOVE ONCE WAS LIKE AN APRIL DAWN

Love once was like an April dawn
Song throbbed within the heart by rote
And every tint of rose or fawn
Was greeted by a joyous note
How eager was my thought to see
Into that morning mystery

Love now is like an August noon
No spot is empty of its shine
The sun makes silence seem a boon
And not a voice so dumb as mine
Yet with what words Id welcome thee 
Couldst thou return dear mystery

Robert Underwood Johnson 1853


THE GARDEN OF SHADOW

Love heeds no more the sighing of the wind
Against the perfect flowers thy gardens close
Is grown a wilderness where none shall find
One strayed last petal of one last years rose

O bright bright hair O mouth like a ripe fruit
Can famine be so nigh to harvesting
Love that was songful with a broken lute
In grass of graveyards goeth murmuring

Let the wind blow against the perfect flowers
And all thy garden change and glow with spring
Love is grown blind with no more count of hours
Nor part in seedtime nor in harvesting

Ernest Dowson 18671900


THE CALL

Love comes laughing up the valleys
Hand in hand with hoyden Spring
All the FlowerPeople nodding
All the FeatheredFolk awing

Higher Higher call the thrushes
Wilder Freer breathe the trees
And the purple mountains beckon
Upward to their mysteries

Always farther leagues to wander
Peak to peak and slope to slope
Lips to sing and feet to follow
Eyes to dream and heart to hope

Tarry Nay but who can tarry
All the world is on the wing
Love comes laughing up the valleys
Hand in hand with hoyden Spring

Reginald Wright Kauffman 1877


THE HIGHWAY

All day long on the highway
The Kings fleet couriers ride
You may hear the tread of their horses sped
Over the country side
They ride for life and they ride for death
And they override who tarrieth
With show of color and flush of pride
They stir the dust on the highway

Let them ride on the highway wide
Love walks in little paths aside

All day long on the highway
Is a tramp of an armys feet
You may see them go in a marshaled row
With the tale of their arms complete
They march for war and they march for peace
For the lust of gold and fames increase
For victories sadder than defeat
They raise the dust on the highway

All the armies of earth defied
Love dwells in little paths aside

All day long on the highway
Rushes an eager band
With straining eyes for a worthless prize
That slips from the grasp like sand
And men leave blood where their feet have stood
And bow them down unto brass and wood 
Idols fashioned by their own hand 
Blind in the dust of the highway

Power and gold and fame denied
Love laughs glad in the paths aside

Louise Driscoll 1875


SONG

Take it love
Twill soon be over
With the thickening of the clover
With the calling of the plover
Take it take it lover

Take it boy
The blossoms falling
And the farewell cuckoos calling
While the sun and showers are one
Take your love out in the sun

Take it girl
And fear no after
Take your fill of all this laughter
Laugh or not the tears will fall
Take the laughter first of all

Richard Le Gallienne 1866


NEVER GIVE ALL THE HEART

Never give all the heart for love
Will hardly seem worth thinking of
To passionate women if it seem
Certain and they never dream
That it fades out from kiss to kiss
For everything thats lovely is
But a brief dreamy kind delight
O never give the heart outright
For they for all smooth lips can say
Have given their hearts up to the play
And who can play it well enough
If deaf and dumb and blind with love
He that made this knows all the cost
For he gave all his heart and lost

William Butler Yeats 1865


SONG

I came to the door of the House of Love
And knocked as the starry night went by
And my true love cried Who knocks and I said
It is I

And Love looked down from a lattice above
Where the roses were dry as the lips of the dead
There is not room in the House of Love
For you both he said

I plucked a leaf from the porch and crept
Away through a desert of scoffs and scorns
To a lonely place where I prayed and wept
And wove me a crown of thorns

I came once more to the House of Love
And knocked ah softly and wistfully
And my true love cried Who knocks and I said
None now but thee

And the great doors opened wide apart
And a voice rang out from a glory of light
Make room make room for a faithful heart
In the House of Love tonight

Alfred Noyes 1880


CHILD CHILD

Child child love while you can
The voice and the eyes and the soul of a man
Never fear though it break your heart 
Out of the wound new joy will start
Only love proudly and gladly and well
Though love be heaven or love be hell

Child child love while you may
For life is short as a happy day
Never fear the thing you feel 
Only by love is life made real
Love for the deadly sins are seven
Only through love will you enter heaven

Sara Teasdale 18841933


WISDOM

The young girl questions Whether were it better
To lie for ever a warm slugabed
Or to rise up and bide by Fate and Chance
The rawness of the morning
The gibing and the scorning
Of the stern Teacher of my ignorance
I know not Wisdom said

The young girl questions Friend shall I die calmer
If Ive lain for ever sheets above the head
Warm in a dream or rise to take the worst
Of peril in the highways
Of straying in the byways
Of hunger for the truth of drought and thirst
We do not know he said
Nor may till we be dead

Ford Madox Ford 1873


EPILOGUE
From Emblems Of Love

What shall we do for Love these days
How shall we make an altarblaze
To smite the horny eyes of men
With the renown of our Heaven
And to the unbelievers prove
Our service to our dear god Love
What torches shall we lift above
The crowd that pushes through the mire
To amaze the dark heads with strange fire
I should think I were much to blame
If never I held some fragrant flame
Above the noises of the world
And openly mid mens hurrying stares
Worshipped before the sacred fears
That are like flashing curtains furled
Across the presence of our lord Love
Nay would that I could fill the gaze
Of the whole earth with some great praise
Made in a marvel for mens eyes
Some tower of glittering masonries
Therein such a spirit flourishing
Men should see what my heart can sing
All that Love hath done to me
Built into stone a visible glee
Marble carried to gleaming height
As moved aloft by inward delight
Not as with toil of chisels hewn
But seeming poised in a mighty tune
For of all those who have been known
To lodge with our kind host the sun
I envy one for just one thing
In Cordova of the Moors
There dwelt a passionminded King
Who set great bands of marblehewers
To fashion his hearts thanksgiving
In a tall palace shapen so
All the wondering world might know
The joy he had of his Moorish lass
His love that brighter and larger was
Than the starry places into firm stone
He sent as if the stone were glass
Fired and into beauty blown
Solemn and invented gravely
In its bulk the fabric stood
Even as Love that trusteth bravely
In its own exceeding good
To be better than the waste
Of times devices grandly spaced
Seriously the fabric stood
But over it all a pleasure went
Of carven delicate ornament
Wreathing up like ravishment
Mentioning in sculptures twined
The blitheness Love hath in his mind
And like delighted senses were
The windows and the columns there
Made the following sight to ache
As the heart that did them make
Well I can see that shining song
Flowering there the upward throng
Of porches pillars and windowed walls
Spires like piercing panpipe calls
Up to the roofs snowcloud flight
All glancing in the Spanish light
White as water of arctic tides
Save an amber dazzle on sunny sides
You had said the radiant sheen
Of that palace might have been
A young gods fantasy ere he came
His serious worlds and suns to frame
Such an immortal passion
Quivered among the slim hewn stone
And in the nights it seemed a jar
Cut in the substance of a star
Wherein a wine that will be poured
Some time for feasting Heaven was stored
But within this fretted shell
The wonder of Love made visible
The King a private gentle mood
There placed of pleasant quietude
For right amidst there was a court
Where always musked silences
Listened to water and to trees
And herbage of all fragrant sort 
Lavender ladslove rosemary
Basil tansy centaury 
Was the grass of that orchard hid
Loves amazements all amid
Jarring the air with rumor cool
Small fountains played into a pool
With sound as soft as the barleys hiss
When its beard just sprouting is
Whence a young stream that trod on moss
Prettily rimpled the court across
And in the pools clear idleness
Moving like dreams through happiness
Shoals of small bright fishes were
In and out weedthickets bent
Perch and carp and sauntering went
With mounching jaws and eyes astare
Or on a lotus leaf would crawl
A brindled loach to bask and sprawl
Tasting the warm sun ere it dipped
Into the water but quick as fear
Back his shining brown head slipped
To crouch on the gravel of his lair
Where the cooled sunbeams broke in wrack
Spilt shattered gold about his back
So within that greenveiled air
Within that whitewalled quiet where
Innocent water thought aloud 
Childish prattle that must make
The wise sunlight with laughter shake
On the leafage overbowed 
Often the King and his lovelass
Let the delicious hours pass
All the outer world could see
Graved and sawn amazingly
Their loves delighted riotise
Fixed in marble for all mens eyes
But only these twain could abide
In the cool peace that withinside
Thrilling desire and passion dwelt
They only knew the still meaning spelt
By Loves flaming script which is
Gods word written in ecstasies
And where is now that palace gone
All the magical skilled stone
All the dreaming towers wrought
By Love as if no more than thought
The unresisting marble was
How could such a wonder pass
Ah it was but built in vain
Against the stupid horns of Rome
That pushed down into the common loam
The loveliness that shone in Spain
But we have raised it up again
A loftier palace fairer far
Is ours and one that fears no war
Safe in marvellous walls we are
Wondering sense like builded fires
High amazement of desires
Delight and certainty of love
Closing around roofing above
Our unapproached and perfect hour
Within the splendors of loves power

Lascelles Abercrombie 1881


ON HAMPSTEAD HEATH

Against the green flame of the hawthorntree
His scarlet tunic burns
And livelier than the green saps mantling glee
The Spring fire tingles through him headily
As quivering he turns
And stammers out the old amazing tale
Of youth and April weather
While she with halfbreathed jests that sobbing fail
Sits tightlipped quaking eagereyed and pale
Beneath her purple feather

Wilfrid Wilson Gibson 1878


ONCE ON A TIME

Once on a time once on a time
Before the Dawn began
There was a nymph of Dians train
Who was beloved of Pan
Once on a time a peasant lad
Who loved a lass at home
Once on a time a Saxon king
Who loved a queen of Rome

The world has but one song to sing
And it is ever new
The first and last of all the songs
For it is ever true 
A little song a tender song
The only song it hath
There was a youth of Ascalon
Who loved a girl of Gath

A thousand thousand years have gone
And aeons still shall pass
Yet shall the world forever sing
Of him who loved a lass 
An olden song a golden song
And sing it unafraid
There was a youth once on a time
Who dearly loved a maid

Kendall Banning 1879






IN PRAISE OF HER






FIRST SONG
From Astrophel and Stella

Doubt you to whom my Muse these notes intendeth
Which now my breast oercharged to music lendeth
To you to you all song of praise is due
Only in you my song begins and endeth

Who hath the eyes which marry state with pleasure
Who keeps the key of Natures chiefest treasure
To you to you all song of praise is due
Only for you the heaven forgat all measure

Who hath the lips where wit in fairness reigneth
Who womankind at once both decks and staineth
To you to you all song of praise is due
Only by you Cupid his crown maintaineth

Who hath the feet whose step all sweetness planteth
Who else for whom Fame worthy trumpets wanteth
To you to you all song of praise is due
Only to you her sceptre Venus granteth

Who hath the breast whose milk doth passions nourish
Whose grace is such that when it chides doth cherish
To you to you all song of praise is due
Only through you the tree of life doth flourish

Who hath the hand which without stroke subdueth
Who longdead beauty with increase reneweth
To you to you all song of praise is due
Only at you all envy hopeless rueth

Who hath the hair which loosest fastest tieth
Who makes a man live then glad when he dieth
To you to you all song of praise is due
Only of you the flatterer never lieth

Who hath the voice which soul from senses sunders
Whose force but yours the bolts of beauty thunders
To you to you all song of praise is due
Only with you not miracles are wonders

Doubt you to whom my Muse these notes intendeth
Which now my breast oercharged to music lendeth
To you to you all song of praise is due
Only in you my song begins and endeth

Philip Sidney 15541586


SILVIA
From The Two Gentlemen of Verona

Who is Silvia What is she
That all our swains commend her
Holy fair and wise is she
The heaven such grace did lend her
That she might admired be

Is she kind as she is fair
For beauty lives with kindness
Love doth to her eyes repair
To help him of his blindness
And being helped inhabits there

Then to Silvia let us sing
That Silvia is excelling
She excels each mortal thing
Upon the dull earth dwelling
To her let us garlands bring

William Shakespeare 15641616


CUPID AND CAMPASPE
From Alexander and Campaspe

Cupid and my Campaspe played
At cards for kisses Cupid paid
He stakes his quiver bow and arrows
His mothers doves and team of sparrows
Loses them too then down he throws
The coral of his lip the rose
Growing ons cheek but none knows how
With these the crystal of his brow
And then the dimple on his chin
All these did my Campaspe win
And last he set her both his eyes 
She won and Cupid blind did rise

O Love has she done this to thee
What shall alas become of me

John Lyly 15541606


APOLLOS SONG
From Midas

My Daphnes hair is twisted gold
Bright stars apiece her eyes do hold
My Daphnes brow enthrones the Graces
My Daphnes beauty stains all faces
On Daphnes cheek grow rose and cherry
On Daphnes lip a sweeter berry
Daphnes snowy hand but touched does melt
And then no heavenlier warmth is felt
My Daphnes voice tunes all the spheres
My Daphnes music charms all ears
Fond am I thus to sing her praise
These glories now are turned to bays

John Lyly 15541606


FAIR IS MY LOVE FOR APRILS IN HER FACE
From Perimedes

Fair is my love for Aprils in her face
Her lovely breasts September claims his part
And lordly July in her eyes takes place
But cold December dwelleth in her heart
Blest be the months that set my thoughts on fire
Accurst that month that hindereth my desire

Like Phoebus fire so sparkle both her eyes
As air perfumed with amber is her breath
Like swelling waves her lovely breasts do rise
As earth her heart cold dateth me to death
Aye me poor man that on the earth do live
When unkind earth death and despair doth give

In pomp sits mercy seated in her face
Love twixt her breasts his trophies doth imprint
Her eyes shine favor courtesy and grace
But touch her heart ah that is framed of flint
Therefore my harvest in the grass bears grain
The rock will wear washed with a winters rain

Robert Greene 15601592


SAMELA
From Menaphon

Like to Diana in her summer weed
Girt with a crimson robe of brightest dye
Goes fair Samela
Whiter than be the flocks that straggling feed
When washed by Arethusas Fount they lie
Is fair Samela

As fair Aurora in her morninggray
Decked with the ruddy glister of her love
Is fair Samela
Like lovely Thetis on a calmed day
Whenas her brightness Neptunes fancy move
Shines fair Samela

Her tresses gold her eyes like glassy streams
Her teeth are pearl the breasts are ivory
Of fair Samela
Her cheeks like rose and lily yield forth gleams
Her brows bright arches framed of ebony
Thus fair Samela

Passeth fair Venus in her bravest hue
And Juno in the show of majesty
For shes Samela
Pallas in wit  all three if you well view
For beauty wit and matchless dignity
Yield to Samela

Robert Greene 15601592


DAMELUS SONG OF HIS DIAPHENIA

Diaphenia like the daffadowndilly
White as the sun fair as the lily
Heigh ho how I do love thee
I do love thee as my lambs
Are beloved of their dams 
How blest were I if thou wouldst prove me

Diaphenia like the spreading roses
That in thy sweets all sweets encloses
Fair sweet how I do love thee
I do love thee as each flower
Loves the suns lifegiving power
For dead thy breath to life might move me

Diaphenia like to all things blessed
When all thy praises are expressed
Dear joy how I do love thee
As the birds do love the spring
Or the bees their careful king
Then in requite sweet virgin love me

Henry Constable 15621613


MADRIGAL

My love in her attire doth show her wit
It doth so well become her
For every season she hath dressings fit
For Winter Spring and Summer

No beauty she doth miss
When all her robes are on
But Beautys self she is
When all her robes are gone

ON CHLORIS WALKING IN THE SNOW

I saw fair Chloris walk alone
Whilst feathered rain came softly down
As Jove descended from his tower
To court her in a silver shower
The wanton snow flew on her breast
Like little birds unto their nest
But overcome with whiteness there
For grief it thawed into a tear
Thence falling on her garments hem
To deck her froze into a gem

William Strode 16021645


THERE IS A LADY SWEET AND KIND

There is a lady sweet and kind
Was never face so pleased my mind
I did but see her passing by
And yet I love her till I die

Her gesture motion and her smiles
Her wit her voice my heart beguiles
Beguiles my heart I know not why
And yet I love her till I die

Cupid is winged and doth range
Her country so my love doth change
But change she earth or change she sky
Yet I will love her till I die

Unknown


CHERRYRIPE

There is a garden in her face
Where roses and white lilies blow
A heavenly paradise is that place
Wherein all pleasant fruits do flow
There cherries grow which none may buy
Till Cherryripe themselves do cry

Those cherries fairly do enclose
Of orient pearl a double row
Which when her lovely laughter shows
They look like rosebuds filled with snow
Yet them nor peer nor prince can buy
Till Cherryripe themselves do cry

Her eyes like angels watch them still
Her brows like bended bows do stand
Threatening with piercing frowns to kill
All that attempt with eye or hand
Those sacred cherries to come nigh
Till Cherryripe themselves do cry

Thomas Campion   1619


AMARILLIS

I care not for these ladies
That must be wooed and prayed
Give me kind Amarillis
The wanton countrymaid
Nature art disdaineth
Her beauty is her own
Her when we court and kiss
She cries Forsooth let go
But when we come where comfort is
She never will say No

If I love Amarillis
She gives me fruit and flowers
But if we love these ladies
We must give golden showers
Give them gold that sell love
Give me the Nutbrown lass
Who when we court and kiss
She cries Forsooth let go
But when we come where comfort is
She never will say No

These ladies must have pillows
And beds by strangers wrought
Give me a bower of willows
Of moss and leaves unbought
And fresh Amarillis
With milk and honey fed
Who when we court and kiss
She cries Forsooth let go
But when we come where comfort is
She never will say No

Thomas Campion   1619


ELIZABETH OF BOHEMIA

You meaner beauties of the night
That poorly satisfy our eyes
More by your number than your light
You common people of the skies
What are you when the moon shall rise

You curious chanters of the wood
That warble forth Dame Natures lays
Thinking your passions understood
By your weak accents whats your praise
When Philomel her voice shall raise

You violets that first appear
By your pure purple mantles known
Like the proud virgins of the year
As if the spring were all your own
What are you when the rose is blown

So when my mistress shall be seen
In form and beauty of her mind
By virtue first then choice a Queen
Tell me if she were not designed
Th eclipse and glory of her kind

Henry Walton 15681639


HER TRIUMPH
From A Celebration of Charis

See the Chariot at hand here of Love
Wherein my Lady rideth
Each that draws is a swan or a dove
And well the car Love guideth
As she goes all hearts do duty
Unto her beauty
And enamored do wish so they might
But enjoy such a sight
That they still were to run by her side
Through swords through seas whither she would ride

Do but look on her eyes they do light
All that Loves world compriseth
Do but look on her hair it is bright
As Loves star when it riseth
Do but mark her foreheads smoother
Than Words that soothe her
And from her arched brows such a grace
Sheds itself through the face
As alone there triumphs to the life
All the gain all the good of the elements strife

Have you seen but a bright lily grow
Before rude hands have touched it
Have you marked but the fall o the snow
Before the soil hath smutched it
Have you felt the wool of beaver
Or swans down ever
Or have smelt o the bud o the brier
Or the nard in the fire
Or have tasted the bag o the bee
O so white O so soft O so sweet is she

Ben Jonson 15731637


OF PHYLLIS

In petticoat of green
Her hair about her eyne
Phyllis beneath an oak
Sat milking her fair flock
Among that sweetstrained moisture rare delight
Her hand seemed milk in milk it was so white

William Drummond 15851649


A WELCOME

Welcome welcome do I sing
Far more welcome than the spring
He that parteth from you never
Shall enjoy a spring forever

He that to the voice is near
Breaking from your ivory pale
Need not walk abroad to hear
The delightful nightingale

He that looks still on your eyes
Though the winter have begun
To benumb our arteries
Shall not want the summers sun

He that still may see your cheeks
Where all rareness still reposes
Is a fool if eer he seeks
Other lilies other roses

He to whom your soft lip yields
And perceives your breath in kissing
All the odors of the fields
Never never shall be missing

He that question would anew
What fair Eden was of old
Let him rightly study you
And a brief of that behold

Welcome welcome then I sing
Far more welcome than the spring
He that parteth from you never
Shall enjoy a spring forever

William Browne 15911643


THE COMPLETE LOVER

For her gait if she be walking
Be she sitting I desire her
For her states sake and admire her
For her wit if she be talking
Gait and state and wit approve her
For which all and each I love her

Be she sullen I commend her
For a modest Be she merry
For a kind one her prefer I
Briefly everything doth lend her
So much grace and so approve her
That for everything I love her

William Browne 15911643


RUBIES AND PEARLS

Some asked me where the rubies grew
And nothing I did say
But with my finger pointed to
The lips of Julia

Some asked how pearls did grow and where
Then spoke I to my girl
To part her lips and showed them there
The quarrelets of pearl

Robert Herrick 15911674


UPON JULIAS CLOTHES

Whenas in silks my Julia goes
Then then methinks how sweetly flows
The liquefaction of her clothes
Next when I cast mine eyes and see
That brave vibration each way free
 O how that glittering taketh me

Robert Herrick 15911674


TO CYNTHIA ON CONCEALMENT OF HER BEAUTY

Do not conceal those radiant eyes
The starlight of serenest skies
Lest wanting of their heavenly light
They turn to chaos endless night

Do not conceal those tresses fair
The silken snares of thy curled hair
Lest finding neither gold nor ore
The curious silkworm work no more

Do not conceal those breasts of thine
More snowwhite than the Apennine
Lest if there be like cold and frost
The lily be for ever lost

Do not conceal that fragrant scent
Thy breath which to all flowers hath lent
Perfumes lest it being suppressed
No spices grow in all the East

Do not conceal thy heavenly voice
Which makes the hearts of gods rejoice
Lest music hearing no such thing
The nightingale forget to sing

Do not conceal nor yet eclipse
Thy pearly teeth with coral lips
Lest that the seas cease to bring forth
Gems which from thee have all their worth

Do not conceal no beauty grace
Thats either in thy mind or face
Lest virtue overcome by vice
Make men believe no Paradise

Francis Kynaston 15871642


SONG

Ask me no more where Jove bestows
When June is past the fading rose
For in your beautys orient deep
These flowers as in their causes sleep

Ask me no more whither do stray
The golden atoms of the day
For in pure love heaven did prepare
Those powders to enrich your hair

Ask me no more whither doth haste
The nightingale when May is past
For in your sweet dividing throat
She winters and keeps warm her note

Ask me no more where those stars light
That downwards fall in dead of night
For in your eyes they sit and there
Fixed become as in their sphere

Ask me no more if east or west
The Phoenix builds her spicy nest
For unto you at last she flies
And in your fragrant bosom dies

Thomas Carew 15981639


A DEVOUT LOVER

I have a mistress for perfections rare
In every eye but in my thoughts most fair
Like tapers on the altar shine her eyes
Her breath is the perfume of sacrifice
And wheresoeer my fancy would begin
Still her perfection lets religion in
We sit and talk and kiss away the hours
As chastely as the morning dews kiss flowers
I touch her like my beads with devout care
And come unto my courtship as my prayer

Thomas Randolph 16051635


ON A GIRDLE

That which her slender waist confined
Shall now my joyful temples bind
No monarch but would give his crown
His arms might do what this has done

It was my Heavens extremest sphere
The pale which held that lovely deer
My joy my grief my hope my love
Did all within this circle move

A narrow compass and yet there
Dwelt all thats good and all thats fair
Give me but what this ribbon bound
Take all the rest the sun goes round

Edmund Waller 16061687


CASTARA

Like the violet which alone
Prospers in some happy shade
My Castara lives unknown
To no looser eye betrayed
For shes to herself untrue
Who delights i the public view

Such is her beauty as no arts
Have enriched with borrowed grace
Her high birth no pride imparts
For she blushes in her place
Folly boasts a glorious blood
She is noblest being good

Cautious she knew never yet
What a wanton courtship meant
Nor speaks loud to boast her wit
In her silence eloquent
Of herself survey she takes
But tween men no difference makes

She obeys with speedy will
Her grave parents wise commands
And so innocent that ill
She nor acts nor understands
Womens feet run still astray
If to ill they know the way

She sails by that rock the court
Where oft virtue splits her mast
And retiredness thinks the port
Where her fame may anchor cast
Virtue safely cannot sit
Where vice is enthroned for wit

She holds that days pleasure best
Where sin waits not on delight
Without mask or ball or feast
Sweetly spends a winters night
Oer that darkness whence is thrust
Prayer and sleep oft governs lust

She her throne makes reason climb
While wild passions captive lie
And each article of time
Her pure thoughts to heaven fly
All her vows religious be
And she vows her love to me

William Habington 16051654


TO ARAMANTHA
That She Would Dishevel Her Hair

Aramantha sweet and fair
Ah braid no more that shining hair
As my curious hand or eye
Hovering round thee let it fly

Let it fly as unconfined
As its calm ravisher the wind
Who hath left his darling th east
To wanton in that spicy nest

Every tress must be confessed
But neatly tangled at the best
Like a clew of golden thread
Most excellently ravelled

Do not then wind up that light
In ribbons and oercloud in night
Like the sun ins early ray
But shake your head and scatter day

Richard Lovelace 16181658


CHLOE DIVINE

Chloes a Nymph in flowery groves
A Nereid in the streams
Saintlike she in the temple moves
A woman in my dreams

Love steals artillery from her eyes
The Graces point her charms
Orpheus is rivalled in her voice
And Venus in her arms

Never so happily in one
Did heaven and earth combine
And yet tis flesh and blood alone
That makes her so divine

Thomas DUrfey 16531723


MY PEGGY

My Peggy is a young thing
Just entered in her teens
Fair as the day and sweet as May
Fair as the day and always gay
My Peggy is a young thing
And Im na very auld
Yet weel I like to meet her at
The wauking o the fauld

My Peggy speaks sae sweetly
Wheneer we meet alane
I wish nae mair to lay my care
I wish nae mair o a thats rare
My Peggy speaks sae sweetly
To a the lave Im cauld
But she gars a my spirits glow
At wauking o the fauld

My Peggy smiles sae kindly
Wheneer I whisper love
That I look doun on a the toun
That I look doun upon a croun
My Peggy smiles sae kindly
It makes me blithe and bauld
And naething gies me sic delight
As waulking o the fauld

My Peggy sings sae saftly
When on my pipe I play
By a the rest it is confessed
By a the rest that she sings best
My Peggy sings sae saftly
And in her sangs are tauld
Wi innocence the wale o sense
At wauking o the fauld

Allan Ramsay 16861758


SONG
From Acis and Galatea

O ruddier than the cherry
O sweeter than the berry
O nymph more bright
Than moonshine night
Like kidlings blithe and merry
Ripe as the melting luster
Yet hard to tame
As raging flame
And fierce as storms that bluster

John Gay 16851732


TELL ME MY HEART IF THIS BE LOVE

When Delia on the plain appears
Awed by a thousand tender fears
I would approach but dare not move
Tell me my heart if this be love

Wheneer she speaks my ravished ear
No other voice than hers can hear
No other wit but hers approve
Tell me my heart if this be love

If she some other youth commend
Though I was once his fondest friend
His instant enemy I prove
Tell me my heart if this be love

When she is absent I no more
Delight in all that pleased before 
The clearest spring or shadiest grove
Tell me my heart if this be love

When fond of power of beauty vain
Her nets she spread for every swain
I strove to hate but vainly strove
Tell me my heart if this be love

George Lyttleton 17091773


THE FAIR THIEF

Before the urchin well could go
She stole the whiteness of the snow
And more that whiteness to adorn
She stole the blushes of the morn
Stole all the sweetness ether sheds
On primrose buds and violet beds

Still to reveal her artful wiles
She stole the Graces silken smiles
She stole Auroras balmy breath
And pilfered orient pearl for teeth
The cherry dipped in morning dew
Gave moisture to her lips and hue

These were her infant spoils a store
And she in time still pilfered more
At twelve she stole from Cyprus queen
Her air and lovecommanding mien
Stole Junos dignity and stole
From Pallas sense to charm the soul

Apollos wit was next her prey
Her next the beam that lights the day
She sang  amazed the Sirens heard
And to assert their voice appeared
She played  the Muses from their hill
Wondered who thus had stole their skill

Great Jove approved her crimes and art
And tother day she stole my heart
If lovers Cupid are thy care
Exert thy vengeance on this Fair
To trial bring her stolen charms
And let her prison be my arms

Charles Wyndham 17101763


AMORET

If rightly tuneful bards decide
If it be fixed in Loves decrees
That Beauty ought not to be tried
But by its native power to please
Then tell me youths and lovers tell 
What fair can Amoret excel

Behold that bright unsullied smile
And wisdom speaking in her mien
Yet  she so artless all the while
So little studious to be seen 
We naught but instant gladness know
Nor think to whom the gift we owe

But neither music nor the powers
Of youth and mirth and frolic cheer
Add half the sunshine to the hours
Or make lifes prospect half so clear
As memory brings it to the eye
From scenes where Amoret was by

This sure is Beautys happiest part
This gives the most unbounded sway
This shall enchant the subject heart
When rose and lily fade away
And she be still in spite of Time
Sweet Amoret in all her prime

Mark Akenside 17211770


SONG

The shape alone let others prize
The features of the fair
I look for spirit in her eyes
And meaning in her air

A damask cheek an ivory arm
Shall neer my wishes win
Give me an animated form
That speaks a mind within

A face where awful honor shines
Where sense and sweetness move
And angel innocence refines
The tenderness of love

These are the soul of beautys frame
Without whose vital aid
Unfinished all her features seem
And all her roses dead

But ah where both their charms unite
How perfect is the view
With every image of delight
With graces ever new

Of power to charm the greatest woe
The wildest rage control
Diffusing mildness oer the brow
And rapture through the soul

Their power but faintly to express
All language must despair
But go behold Arpasias face
And read it perfect there

Mark Akenside 17211770


KATE OF ABERDEEN

The silver moons enamored beam
Steals softly through the night
To wanton with the winding stream
And kiss reflected light
To beds of state go balmy sleep
Tis where youve seldom been
Mays vigil while the shepherds keep
With Kate of Aberdeen

Upon the green the virgins wait
In rosy chaplets gay
Till morn unbar her golden gate
And give the promised May
Methinks I hear the maids declare
The promised May when seen
Not half so fragrant half so fair
As Kate of Aberdeen

Strike up the tabors boldest notes
Well rouse the nodding grove
The nested birds shall raise their throats
And hail the maid of love
And see  the matin lark mistakes
He quits the tufted green
Fond bird tis not the morning breaks 
Tis Kate of Aberdeen

Now lightsome oer the level mead
Where midnight fairies rove
Like them the jocund dance well lead
Or tune the reed to love
For see the rosy May draws nigh
She claims a virgin Queen
And hark the happy shepherds cry
Tis Kate of Aberdeen

John Cunningham 17291773


SONG

Who has robbed the ocean cave
To tinge thy lips with coral hue
Who from Indias distant wave
For thee those pearly treasures drew
Who from yonder orient sky
Stole the morning of thine eye

A thousand charms thy form to deck
From sea and earth and air are torn
Roses bloom upon thy cheek
On thy breath their fragrance borne
Guard thy bosom from the day
Lest thy snows should melt away

But one charm remains behind
Which mute earth can neer impart
Nor in ocean wilt thou find
Nor in the circling air a heart
Fairest wouldst thou perfect be
Take oh take that heart from me

John Shaw 15591625


CHLOE

It was the charming month of May
When all the flowers were fresh and gay
One morning by the break of day
The youthful charming Chloe
From peaceful slumber she arose
Girt on her mantle and her hose
And oer the flowery mead she goes
The youthful charming Chloe
Lovely was she by the dawn
Youthful Chloe charming Chloe
Tripping oer the pearly lawn
The youthful charming Chloe

The feathered people you might see
Perched all around on every tree
In notes of sweetest melody
They hail the charming Chloe
Till painting gay the eastern skies
The glorious sun began to rise
Outrivalled by the radiant eyes
Of youthful charming Chloe
Lovely was she by the dawn
Youthful Chloe charming Chloe
Tripping oer the pearly lawn
The youthful charming Chloe

Robert Burns 17591796


O MALLYS MEEK MALLYS SWEET

As I was walking up the street
A barefit maid I chanced to meet
But O the road was very hard
For that fair maidens tender feet
O Mallys meek Mallys sweet
Mallys modest and discreet
Mallys rare Mallys fair
Mallys every way complete

It were more meet that those fine feet
Were weel laced up in silken shoon
And twere more fit that she should sit
Within yon chariot gilt aboon

Her yellow hair beyond compare
Comes trinkling down her swanwhite neck
And her two eyes like stars in skies
Would keep a sinking ship frae wreck
O Mallys meek Mallys sweet
Mallys modest and discreet
Mallys rare Mallys fair
Mallys every way complete

Robert Burns 17591796


THE LOVERS CHOICE

You Damon covet to possess
The nymph that sparkles in her dress
Would rustling silks and hoops invade
And clasp an armful of brocade

Such raise the price of your delight
Who purchase both their red and white
And piratelike surprise your heart
With colors of adulterate art

Me Damon me the maid enchants
Whose cheeks the hand of nature paints
A modest blush adorns her face
Her air an unaffected grace

No art she knows or seeks to know
No charm to wealthy pride will owe
No gems no gold she needs to wear
She shines intrinsically fair

Thomas Bedingfield   1613


RONDEAU REDOUBLE

My day and night are in my ladys hand
I have no other sunrise than her sight
For me her favor glorifies the land
Her anger darkens all the cheerful light
Her face is fairer than the hawthorn white
When all aflower in May the hedgerows stand
While she is kind I know of no affright
My day and night are in my ladys hand

All heaven in her glorious eyes is spanned
Her smile is softer than the summers night
Gladder than daybreak on the Faery strand
I have no other sunrise than her sight
Her silver speech is like the singing flight
Of runnels rippling oer the jewelled sand
Her kiss a dream of delicate delight
For me her favor glorifies the land

What if the Winter chase the Summer bland
The gold sun in her hair burns ever bright
If she be sad straightway all joy is banned
Her anger darkens all the cheerful light
Come weal or woe I am my ladys knight
And in her service every ill withstand
Love is my Lord in all the worlds despite
And holdeth in the hollow of his hand
My day and night

John Payne 18421916


MY LOVE SHES BUT A LASSIE YET

My love shes but a lassie yet
A lightsome lovely lassie yet
It scarce wad do
To sit an woo
Down by the stream sae glassy yet

But theres a braw time coming yet
When we may gang aroaming yet
An hint wi glee
O joys to be
When fas the modest gloaming yet

Shes neither proud nor saucy yet
Shes neither plump nor gaucy yet
But just a jinking
Bonny blinking
Hiltyskilty lassie yet

But O her artless smiles mair sweet
Than hinny or than marmalete
An right or wrang
Ere it be lang
Ill bring her to a parley yet

Im jealous o what blesses her
The very breeze that kisses her
The flowery beds
On which she treads
Though wae for ane that misses her

Then O to meet my lassie yet
Up in yon glen sae grassy yet
For all I see
Are naught to me
Save her thats but a lassie yet

James Hogg 17701835


JESSIE THE FLOWER O DUNBLANE

The sun has gane down oer the lofty Benlomond
And left the red clouds to preside oer the scene
While lanely I stray in the calm simmer gloamin
To muse on sweet Jessie the Flower o Dunblane

How sweet is the brier wi its saft fauldin blossom
And sweet is the birk wi its mantle o green
Yet sweeter and fairer and dear to this bosom
Is lovely young Jessie the Flower o Dunblane

Shes modest as ony and blithe as shes bonnie
For guileless simplicity marks her its ain
And far be the villain divested of feeling
Whad blight in its bloom the sweet Flower o Dunblane

Sing on thou sweet mavis thy hymn to the eening
Thourt dear to the echoes of Calderwood glen
Sae dear to this bosom sae artless and winning
Is charming young Jessie the Flower o Dunblane

How lost were my days till I met wi my Jessie
The sports o the city seemed foolish and vain
I neer saw a nymph I would ca my dear lassie
Till charmed wi sweet Jessie the Flower o Dunblane

Though mine were the station o loftiest grandeur
Amidst its profusion Id languish in pain
And reckon as naething the height o its splendor
If wanting sweet Jessie the Flower o Dunblane

Robert Tannahill 17741810


MARGARET AND DORA

Margarets beauteous  Grecian arts
Neer drew form completer
Yet why in my hearts of hearts
Hold I Doras sweeter

Doras eyes of heavenly blue
Pass all paintings reach
Ringdoves notes are discord to
The music of her speech

Artists Margarets smile receive
And on canvas show it
But for perfect worship leave
Dora to her poet

Thomas Campbell 17771844


DAGONETS CANZONET

A queen lived in the South
And music was her mouth
And sunshine was her hair
By day and all the night
The drowsy embers there
Remembered still the light
My soul was she not fair

But for her eyes  they made
An iron man afraid
Like skyblue pools they were
Watching the sky that knew
Itself transmuted there
Light blue or deeper blue
My soul was she not fair

The lifting of her hands
Made laughter in the lands
Where the sun is in the South
But my soul learnt sorrow there
In the secrets of her mouth
Her eyes her hands her hair
O soul was she not fair

Ernest Rhys 1859


STANZAS FOR MUSIC

There be none of Beautys daughters
With a magic like thee
And like music on the waters
Is thy sweet voice to me
When as if its sound were causing
The charmed oceans pausing
The waves lie still and gleaming
And the lulled winds seem dreaming

And the midnight moon is weaving
Her bright chain oer the deep
Whose breast is gently heaving
As an infants asleep
So the spirit bows before thee
To listen and adore thee
With a full but soft emotion
Like the swell of Summers ocean

George Gordon Byron 17881824


FLOWERS I WOULD BRING

Flowers I would bring if flowers could make thee fairer
And music if the Muse were dear to thee
For loving these would make thee love the bearer
But sweetest songs forget their melody
And loveliest flowers would but conceal the wearer 
A rose I marked and might have plucked but she
Blushed as she bent imploring me to spare her
Nor spoil her beauty by such rivalry
Alas and with what gifts shall I pursue thee
What offerings bring what treasures lay before thee
When earth with all her floral train doth woo thee
And all old poets and old songs adore thee
And love to thee is naught from passionate mood
Secured by joys complacent plenitude

Aubrey Thomas de Vere 18141902


IT IS NOT BEAUTY I DEMAND

It is not Beauty I demand
A crystal brow the moons despair
Nor the snows daughter a white hand
Nor mermaids yellow pride of hair

Tell me not of your starry eyes
Your lips that seem on roses fed
Your breasts where Cupid tumbling lies
Nor sleeps for kissing of his bed 

A bloomy pair of vermeil cheeks
Like Hebes in her ruddiest hours
A breath that softer music speaks
Than summer winds awooing flowers 

These are but gauds nay what are lips
Coral beneath the oceanstream
Whose brink when your adventurer sips
Full oft he perisheth on them

And what are cheeks but ensigns oft
That wave hot youth to fields of blood
Did Helens breast though neer so soft
Do Greece or Ilium any good

Eyes can with baleful ardor burn
Poison can breathe that erst perfumed
Theres many a white hand holds an urn
With lovers hearts to dust consumed

For crystal brows  theres naught within
They are but empty cells for pride
He who the Sirens hair would win
Is mostly strangled in the tide

Give me instead of Beautys bust
A tender heart a loyal mind
Which with temptation I could trust
Yet never linked with error find 

One in whose gentle bosom I
Could pour my secret heart of woes
Like the careburthened honeyfly
That hides his murmurs in the rose 

My earthly Comforter whose love
So indefeasible might be
That when my spirit won above
Hers could not stay for sympathy

George Darley 17951846


SONG

She is not fair to outward view
As many maidens be
Her loveliness I never knew
Until she smiled on me
Oh then I saw her eye was bright
A well of love a spring of light

But now her looks are coy and cold
To mine they neer reply
And yet I cease not to behold
The lovelight in her eye
Her very frowns are fairer far
Than smiles of other maidens are

Hartley Coleridge 17961849


SONG

A violet in her lovely hair
A rose upon her bosom fair
But O her eyes
A lovelier violet disclose
And her ripe lips the sweetest rose
Thats neath the skies

A lute beneath her graceful hand
Breathes music forth at her command
But still her tongue
Far richer music calls to birth
Than all the minstrel power on earth
Can give to song

And thus she moves in tender light
The purest ray where all is bright
Serene and sweet
And sheds a graceful influence round
That hallows een the very ground
Beneath her feet

Charles Swain 18011874


EILEEN AROON

When like the early rose
Eileen Aroon
Beauty in childhood blows
Eileen Aroon
When like a diadem
Buds blush around the stem
Which is the fairest gem

Is it the laughing eye
Eileen Aroon
Is it the timid sigh
Eileen Aroon
Is it the tender tone
Soft as the stringed harps moan
O it is truth alone 
Eileen Aroon

When like the rising day
Eileen Aroon
Love sends his early ray
Eileen Aroon
What makes his dawning glow
Changeless through joy or woe
Only the constant know 
Eileen Aroon

I know a valley fair
Eileen Aroon
I knew a cottage there
Eileen Aroon
Far in that valleys shade
I knew a gentle maid
Flower of a hazel glade 
Eileen Aroon

Who in the song so sweet
Eileen Aroon
Who in the dance so fleet
Eileen Aroon
Dear were her charms to me
Dearer her laughter free
Dearest her constancy 
Eileen Aroon

Were she no longer true
Eileen Aroon
What should her lover do
Eileen Aroon
Fly with his broken chain
Far oer the sounding main
Never to love again 
Eileen Aroon

Youth must with time decay
Eileen Aroon
Beauty must fade away
Eileen Aroon
Castles are sacked in war
Chieftains are scattered far
Truth is a fixed star 
Eileen Aroon

ANNIE LAURIE

Maxwelton braes are bonnie
Where early fas the dew
And its there that Annie Laurie
Gied me her promise true 
Gied me her promise true
Which neer forgot will be
And for bonnie Annie Laurie
Id lay me doun and dee

Her brow is like the snawdrift
Her throat is like the swan
Her face it is the fairest
That eer the sun shone on 
That eer the sun shone on 
And dark blue is her ee
And for bonnie Annie Laurie
Id lay me doun and dee

Like dew on the gowan lying
Is the fa o her fairy feet
And like the winds in summer sighing
Her voice is low and sweet 
Her voice is low and sweet 
And shes a the world to me
And for bonnie Annie Laurie
Id lay me doun and dee

William Douglas 16721748


TO HELEN

Helen thy beauty is to me
Like those Nicaean barks of yore
That gently oer a perfumed sea
The weary wayworn wanderer bore
To his own native shore

On desperate seas long wont to roam
Thy hyacinth hair thy classic face
Thy Naiad airs have brought me home
To the glory that was Greece
And the grandeur that was Rome

Lo in yon brilliant windowniche
How statuelike I see thee stand
The agate lamp within thy hand
Ah Psyche from the regions which
Are Holy Land

Edgar Allan Poe 18091849


A VOICE BY THE CEDAR TREE
From Maud

I
A voice by the cedar tree
In the meadow under the Hall
She is singing an air that is known to me
A passionate ballad gallant and gay
A martial song like a trumpets call
Singing alone in the morning of life
In the happy morning of life and of May
Singing of men that in battle array
Ready in heart and ready in hand
March with banner and bugle and fife
To the death for their native land

II
Maud with her exquisite face
And wild voice pealing up to the sunny sky
And feet like sunny gems on an English green
Maud in the light of her youth and her grace
Singing of Death and of Honor that cannot die
Till I well could weep for a time so sordid and mean
And myself so languid and base

III
Silence beautiful voice
Be still for you only trouble the mind
With a joy in which I cannot rejoice
A glory I shall not find
Still I will hear you no more
For your sweetness hardly leaves me a choice
But to move to the meadow and fall before
Her feet on the meadow grass and adore
Not her who is neither courtly nor kind
Not her not her but a voice

Alfred Tennyson 18091892


SONG

Nay but you who do not love her
Is she not pure gold my mistress
Holds earth aught  speak truth  above her
Aught like this tress see and this tress
And this last fairest tress of all
So fair see ere I let it fall

Because you spend your lives in praising
To praise you search the wide world over
Then why not witness calmly gazing
If earth holds aught  speak truth  above her
Above this tress and this I touch
But cannot praise I love so much

Robert Browning 18121889


THE HENCHMAN

My lady walks her morning round
My ladys page her fleet greyhound
My ladys hair the fond winds stir
And all the birds make songs for her

Her thrushes sing in Rathburn bowers
And Rathburn side is gay with flowers
But neer like hers in flower or bird
Was beauty seen or music heard

The distance of the stars is hers
The least of all her worshipers
The dust beneath her dainty heel
She knows not that I see or feel

Oh proud and calm  she cannot know
Whereer she goes with her I go
Oh cold and fair  she cannot guess
I kneel to share her hounds caress

Gay knights beside her hunt and hawk
I rob their ears of her sweet talk
Her suitors come from east and west
I steal her smiles from every guest

Unheard of her in loving words
I greet her with the song of birds
I reach her with her greenarmed bowers
I kiss her with the lips of flowers

The hound and I are on her trail
The wind and I uplift her veil
As if the calm cold moon she were
And I the tide I follow her

As unrebuked as they I share
The license of the sun and air
And in a common homage hide
My worship from her scorn and pride

Worldwide apart and yet so near
I breathe her charmed atmosphere
Wherein to her my service brings
The reverence due to holy things

Her maiden pride her haughty name
My dumb devotion shall not shame
The love that no return doth crave
To knightly levels lifts the slave

No lance have I in joust or fight
To splinter in my ladys sight
But at her feet how blest were I
For any need of hers to die

John Greenleaf Whittier 18071892


LOVELY MARY DONNELLY

Oh lovely Mary Donnelly its you I love the best
If fifty girls were round you Id hardly see the rest
Be what it may the time of day the place be where it will
Sweet looks of Mary Donnelly they bloom before me still

Her eyes like mountain water thats flowing on a rock
How clear they are how dark they are they give me many a shock
Red rowans warm in sunshine and wetted with a shower
Could neer express the charming lip that has me in its power

Her nose is straight and handsome her eyebrows lifted up
Her chin is very neat and pert and smooth like a china cup
Her hairs the brag of Ireland so weighty and so fine
Its rolling down upon her neck and gathered in a twine

The dance o last WhitMonday night exceeded all before
No pretty girl for miles about was missing from the floor
But Mary kept the belt of love and O but she was gay
She danced a jig she sung a song that took my heart away

When she stood up for dancing her steps were so complete
The music nearly killed itself to listen to her feet
The fiddler moaned his blindness he heard her so much praised
But blessed his luck he wasnt deaf when once her voice she raised

And evermore Im whistling or lilting what you sung
Your smile is always in my heart your name beside my tongue
But youve as many sweethearts as youd count on both your hands
And for myself theres not a thumb or little finger stands

Oh youre the flower o womankind in country or in town
The higher I exalt you the lower Im cast down
If some great lord should come this way and see your beauty bright
And you to be his lady Id own it was but right

O might we live together in a lofty palace hall
Where joyful music rises and where scarlet curtains fall
O might we live together in a cottage mean and small
With sods of grass the only roof and mud the only wall

O lovely Mary Donnelly your beautys my distress
Its far too beauteous to be mine but Ill never wish it less
The proudest place would fit your face and I am poor and low
But blessings be about you dear wherever you may go

William Allingham 18241889


LOVE IN THE VALLEY

Under yonder beechtree single on the greensward
Couched with her arms behind her golden head
Knees and tresses folded to slip and ripple idly
Lies my young love sleeping in the shade
Had I the heart to slide an arm beneath her
Press her parting lips as her waist I gather slow
Waking in amazement she could not but embrace me
Then would she hold me and never let me go

Shy as the squirrel and wayward as the swallow
Swift as the swallow along the rivers light
Circleting the surface to meet his mirrored winglets
Fleeter she seems in her stay than in her flight
Shy as the squirrel that leaps among the pinetops
Wayward as the swallow overhead at set of sun
She whom I love is hard to catch and conquer
Hard but O the glory of the winning were she won

When her mother tends her before the laughing mirror
Tying up her laces looping up her hair
Often she thinks were this wild thing wedded
More love should I have and much less care
When her mother tends her before the lighted mirror
Loosening her laces combing down her curls
Often she thinks were this wild thing wedded
I should miss but one for many boys and girls

Heartless she is as the shadow in the meadows
Flying to the hills on a blue and breezy noon
No she is athirst and drinking up her wonder
Earth to her is young as the slip of the new moon
Deals she an unkindness tis but her rapid measure
Even as in a dance and her smile can heal no less
Like the swinging Maycloud that pelts the flowers with hailstones
Off a sunny border she was made to bruise and bless

Lovely are the curves of the white owl sweeping
Wavy in the dusk lit by one large star
Lone on the firbranch his rattlenote unvaried
Brooding oer the gloom spins the brown evejar
Darker grows the valley more and more forgetting
So were it with me if forgetting could be willed
Tell the grassy hollow that holds the bubbling wellspring
Tell it to forget the source that keeps it filled

Stepping down the hill with her fair companions
Arm in arm all against the raying West
Boldly she sings to the merry tune she marches
Brave in her shape and sweeter unpossessed
Sweeter for she is what my heart first awaking
Whispered the world was morning light is she
Love that so desires would fain keep her changeless
Fain would fling the net and fain have her free

Happy happy time when the white star hovers
Low over dim fields fresh with bloomy dew
Near the face of dawn that draws athwart the darkness
Threading it with color like yewberries the yew
Thicker crowd the shades as the grave East deepens
Glowing and with crimson a long cloud swells
Maiden still the morn is and strange she is and secret
Strange her eyes her cheeks are cold as cold seashells

Sunrays leaning on our southern hills and lighting
Wild cloudmountains that drag the hills along
Oft ends the day of your shifting brilliant laughter
Chill as a dull face frowning on a song
Ay but shows the Southwest a ripplefeathered bosom
Blown to silver while the clouds are shaken and ascend
Scaling the midheavens as they stream there comes a sunset
Rich deep like love in beauty without end

When at dawn she sighs and like an infant to the window
Turns grave eyes craving light released from dreams
Beautiful she looks like a white waterlily
Bursting out of bud in havens of the streams
When from bed she rises clothed from neck to ankle
In her long nightgown sweet as boughs of May
Beautiful she looks like a tall gardenlily
Pure from the night and splendid for the day

Mother of the dews dark eyelashed twilight
Lowlidded twilight oer the valleys brim
Rounding on thy breast sings the dewdelighted skylark
Clear as though the dewdrops had their voice in him
Hidden where the roseflush drinks the rayless planet
Fountainfull he pours the spraying fountainshowers
Let me hear her laughter I would have her ever
Cool as dew in twilight the lark above the flowers

All the girls are out with their baskets for the primrose
Up lanes woods through they troop in joyful bands
My sweet leads she knows not why but now she loiters
Eyes the bent anemones and hangs her hands
Such a look will tell that the violets are peeping
Coming the rose and unaware a cry
Springs in her bosom for odors and for color
Covert and the nightingale she knows not why

Kerchiefed head and chin she darts between her tulips
Streaming like a willow gray in arrowy rain
Some bend beaten cheek to gravel and their angel
She will be she lifts them and on she speeds again
Black the driving rain cloud breasts the iron gateway
She is forth to cheer a neighbor lacking mirth
So when sky and grass met rolling dumb for thunder
Saw I once a white dove sole light of earth

Prim little scholars are the flowers of her garden
Trained to stand in rows and asking if they please
I might love them well but for loving more the wild ones
O my wild ones they tell me more than these
You my wild one you tell of honied fieldrose
Violet blushing eglantine in life and even as they
They by the wayside are earnest of your goodness
You are of lifes on the banks that line the way

Peering at her chamber the white crowns the red rose
Jasmine winds the porch with stars two and three
Parted is the window she sleeps the starry jasmine
Breathes a falling breath that carries thoughts of me
Sweeter unpossessed have I said of her my sweetest
Not while she sleeps while she sleeps the jasmine breathes
Luring her to love she sleeps the starry jasmine
Bears me to her pillow under white rosewreaths

Yellow with birdfoottrefoil are the grassglades
Yellow with cinquefoil of the dewgray leaf
Yellow with stonecrop the mossmounds are yellow
Bluenecked the wheat sways yellowing to the sheaf
Greenyellow bursts from the copse the laughing yaffle
Sharp as a sickle is the edge of shade and shine
Earth in her heart laughs looking at the heavens
Thinking of the harvest I look and think of mine

This I may know her dressing and undressing
Such a change of light shows as when the skies in sport
Shift from cloud to moonlight or edging over thunder
Slips a ray of sun or sweeping into port
White sails furl or on the ocean borders
White sails lean along the waves leaping green
Visions of her shower before me but from eyesight
Guarded she would be like the sun were she seen

Front door and back of the mossed old farmhouse
Open with the morn and in a breezy link
Freshly sparkles garden to stripeshadowed orchard
Green across a rill where on sand the minnows wink
Busy in the grass the early sun of summer
Swarms and the blackbirds mellow fluting notes
Call my darling up with round and roguish challenge
Quaintest richest carol of all the singing throats

Cool was the woodside cool as her white dairy
Keeping sweet the creampan and there the boys from school
Cricketing below rushed brown and red with sunshine
O the dark translucence of the deepeyed cool
Spying from the farm herself she fetched a pitcher
Full of milk and tilted for each in turn the beak
Then a little fellow mouth up and on tiptoe
Said I will kiss you she laughed and leaned her cheek

Doves of the firwood walling high our red roof
Through the long noon coo crooning through the coo
Loose droop the leaves and down the sleepy roadway
Sometimes pipes a chaffinch loose droops the blue
Cows flap a slow tail kneedeep in the river
Breathless given up to sun and gnat and fly
Nowhere is she seen and if I see her nowhere
Lightning may come straight rains and tiger sky

O the golden sheaf the rustling treasurearmful
O the nutbrown tresses nodding interlaced
O the treasuretresses one another over
Nodding O the girdle slack about the waist
Slain are the poppies that shot their random scarlet
Quick amid the wheatears wound about the waist
Gathered see these brides of Earth one blush of ripeness
O the nutbrown tresses nodding interlaced

Large and smoky red the suns cold disk drops
Clipped by naked hills on violet shaded snow
Eastward large and still lights up a bower of moonrise
Whence at her leisure steps the moon aglow
Nightlong on black printbranches our beechtree
Gazes in this whiteness nightlong could I
Here may life on death or death on life be painted
Let me clasp her soul to know she cannot die

Gossips count her faults they scour a narrow chamber
Where there is no window read not heaven or her
When she was a tiny one aged woman quavers
Plucks at my heart and leads me by the ear
Faults she had once as she learned to run and tumbled
Faults of feature some see beauty not complete
Yet good gossips beauty that makes holy
Earth and air may have faults from head to feet

Hither she comes she comes to me she lingers
Deepens her brown eyebrows while in new surprise
High rise the lashes in wonder of a stranger
Yet am I the light and living of her eyes
Something friends have told her fills her heart to brimming
Nets her in her blushes and wounds her and tames 
Sure of her haven O like a dove alighting
Arms up she dropped our souls were in our names

Soon will she lie like a white frost sunrise
Yellow oats and brown wheat barley pale as rye
Long since your sheaves have yielded to the thresher
Felt the girdle loosened seen the tresses fly
Soon will she lie like a bloodred sunset
Swift with the tomorrow greenwinged Spring
Sing from the Southwest bring her back the truants
Nightingale and swallow song and dipping wing

Soft new beechleaves up to beamy April
Spreading bough on bough a primrose mountain you
Lucid in the moon raise lilies to the skyfields
Youngest green transfused in silver shining through
Fairer than the lily than the wild white cherry
Fair as in image my seraph love appears
Borne to me by dreams when dawn is at my eyelids
Fair as in the flesh she swims to me on tears

Could I find a place to be alone with heaven
I would speak my heart out heaven is my need
Every woodland tree is flushing like the dogwood
Flashing like the whitebeam swaying like the reed
Flushing like the dogwood crimson in October
Streaming like the flagreed Southwest blown
Flashing as in gusts the suddenlighted whitebeam
All seem to know what is for heaven alone

George Meredith 18281909


MARIAN

She can be as wise as we
And wiser when she wishes
She can knit with cunning wit
And dress the homely dishes
She can flourish staff or pen
And deal a wound that lingers
She can talk the talk of men
And touch with thrilling fingers

Match her ye across the sea
Natures fond and fiery
Ye who zest the turtles nest
With the eagles eyrie
Soft and loving is her soul
Swift and lofty soaring
Mixing with its dovelike dole
Passionate adoring

Such a she wholl match with me
In flying or pursuing
Subtle wiles are in her smiles
To set the world awooing
She is steadfast as a star
And yet the maddest maiden
She can wage a gallant war
And give the peace of Eden

George Meredith 18281909


PRAISE OF MY LADY

My lady seems of ivory
Forehead straight nose and cheeks that be
Hollowed a little mournfully
Beata mea Domina

Her forehead overshadowed much
By bows of hair has a wave such
As God was good to make for me
Beata mea Domina

Not greatly long my ladys hair
Nor yet with yellow color fair
But thick and crisped wonderfully
Beata mea Domina

Heavy to make the pale face sad
And dark but dead as though it had
Been forged by God most wonderfully
Beata mea Domina

Of some strange metal thread by thread
To stand out from my ladys head
Not moving much to tangle me
Beata mea Domina

Beneath her brows the lids fall slow
The lashes a clear shadow throw
Where I would wish my lips to be
Beata mea Domina

Her great eyes standing far apart
Draw up some memory from her heart
And gaze out very mournfully
Beata mea Domina

So beautiful and kind they are
But most times looking out afar
Waiting for something not for me
Beata mea Domina

I wonder if the lashes long
Are those that do her bright eyes wrong
For always half tears seem to be
Beata mea Domina

Lurking below the underlid
Darkening the place where they lie hid
If they should rise and flow for me
Beata mea Domina

Her full lips being made to kiss
Curled up and pensive each one is
This makes me faint to stand and see
Beata mea Domina

Her lips are not contented now
Because the hours pass so slow
Towards a sweet time pray for me
Beata mea Domina

Nay hold thy peace for who can tell
But this at least I know full well
Her lips are parted longingly
Beata mea Domina

So passionate and swift to move
To pluck at any flying love
That I grow faint to stand and see
Beata mea Domina

Yea there beneath them is her chin
So fine and round it were a sin
To feel no weaker when I see
Beata mea Domina

Gods dealings for with so much care
And troublous faint lines wrought in there
He finishes her face for me
Beata mea Domina

Of her long neck what shall I say
What things about her bodys sway
Like a knights pennon or slim tree
Beata mea Domina

Set gently waving in the wind
Or her long hands that I may find
On some day sweet to move oer me
Beata mea Domina

God pity me though if I missed
The telling how along her wrist
The veins creep dying languidly
Beata mea Domina

Inside her tender palm and thin
Now give me pardon dear wherein
My voice is weak and vexes thee
Beata mea Domina

All men that see her any time
I charge you straightly in this rhyme
What and wherever you may be
Beata mea Domina

To kneel before her as for me
I choke and grow quite faint to see
My lady moving graciously
Beata mea Domina

William Morris 18341896


MADONNA MIA

Under green apple boughs
That never a storm will rouse
My lady hath her house
Between two bowers
In either of the twain
Red roses full of rain
She hath for bondwomen
All kind of flowers

She hath no handmaid fair
To draw her curled gold hair
Through rings of gold that bear
Her whole hairs weight
She hath no maids to stand
Goldclothed on either hand
In all that great green land
None is so great

She hath no more to wear
But one white hood of vair
Drawn over eyes and hair
Wrought with strange gold
Made for some great queens head
Some fair great queen since dead
And one strait gown of red
Against the cold

Beneath her eyelids deep
Love lying seems asleep
Love swift to wake to weep
To laugh to gaze
Her breasts are like white birds
And all her gracious words
As watergrass to herds
In the Junedays

To her all dews that fall
And rains are musical
Her flowers are fed from all
Her joys from these
In the deepfeathered firs
Their gift of joy is hers
In the least breath that stirs
Across the trees

She grows with greenest leaves
Ripens with reddest sheaves
Forgets remembers grieves
And is not sad
The quiet lands and skies
Leave light upon her eyes
None knows her weak or wise
Or tired or glad

None knows none understands
What flowers are like her hands
Though you should search all lands
Wherein time grows
What snows are like her feet
Though his eyes burn with heat
Through gazing on my sweet 
Yet no man knows

Only this thing is said
That white and gold and red
Gods three chief words mans bread
And oil and wine
Were given her for dowers
And kingdom of all hours
And grace of goodly flowers
And various vine

This is my ladys praise
God after many days
Wrought her in unknown ways
In sunset lands
This is my ladys birth
God gave her might and mirth
And laid his whole sweet earth
Between her hands

Under deep apple boughs
My lady hath her house
She wears upon her brows
The flower thereof
All saying but what God saith
To her is as vain breath
She is more strong than death
Being strong as love

Algernon Charles Swinburne 18371909


MEET WE NO ANGELS PANSIE

Came on a Sabbath morn my sweet
In white to find her lover
The grass grew proud beneath her feet
The green elmleaves above her 
Meet we no angels Pansie

She said We meet no angels now
And soft lights streamed upon her
And with white hand she touched a bough
She did it that great honor 
What meet no angels Pansie

O sweet brown hat brown hair brown eyes
Downdropped brown eyes so tender
Then what said I  gallant replies
Seem flattery and offend her 
But  meet we no angels Pansie

Thomas Ashe 18361889


TO DAPHNE

Like appleblossoms white and red
Like hues of dawn which fly too soon
Like bloom of peach so softly spread
Like thorn of May and rose of June 
Oh sweet oh fair beyond compare
Are Daphnes cheeks
Are Daphnes blushing cheeks I swear

That pretty rose which comes and goes
Like April sunshine in the sky
I can command it when I choose 
See how it rises if I cry
Oh sweet oh fair beyond compare
Are Daphnes cheeks
Are Daphnes blushing cheeks I swear

Ah when it lies round lips and eyes
And fades away again to spring
No lover sure could ask for more
Than still to cry and still to sing
Oh sweet oh fair beyond compare
Are Daphnes cheeks
Are Daphnes blushing cheeks I swear

Walter Besant 18361901


GIRL OF THE RED MOUTH

Girl of the red mouth
Love me Love me
Girl of the red mouth
Love me
Tis by its curve I know
Love fashioneth his bow
And bends it  ah even so
Oh girl of the red mouth love me

Girl of the blue eye
Love me Love me
Girl of the dew eye
Love me
Worlds hang for lamps on high
And thoughts world lives in thy
Lustrous and tender eye 
Oh girl of the blue eye love me

Girl of the swans neck
Love me Love me
Girl of the swans neck
Love me
As a marble Greek doth grow
To his steeds back of snow
Thy white neck sits thy shoulder so 
Oh girl of the swans neck love me

Girl of the low voice
Love me Love me
Girl of the sweet voice
Love me
Like the echo of a bell 
Like the bubbling of a well 
Sweeter Love within doth dwell 
Oh girl of the low voice love me

Martin MacDermott 18231905


THE DAUGHTER OF MENDOZA

O lend to me sweet nightingale
Your music by the fountain
And lend to me your cadences
O river of the mountain
That I may sing my gay brunette
A diamond spark in coral set
Gem for a princes coronet 
The daughter of Mendoza

How brilliant is the morning star
The evening star how tender 
The light of both is in her eyes
Their softness and their splendor
But for the lash that shades their light
They were too dazzling for the sight
And when she shuts them all is night 
The daughter of Mendoza

O ever bright and beauteous one
Bewildering and beguiling
The lute is in thy silvery tones
The rainbow in thy smiling
And thine is too oer hill and dell
The bounding of the young gazelle
The arrows flight and oceans swell 
Sweet daughter of Mendoza

What though perchance we no more meet 
What though too soon we sever
Thy form will float like emerald light
Before my vision ever
For who can see and then forget
The glories of my gay brunette 
Thou art too bright a star to set
Sweet daughter of Mendoza

Mirabeau Bonaparte Lamar 17981859


IF SHE BE MADE OF WHITE AND RED

If she be made of white and red
As all transcendent beauty shows
If heaven be blue above her head
And earth be golden as she goes
Nay then thy deftest words restrain
Tell not that beauty it is vain

If she be filled with love and scorn
As all divinest natures are
If twixt her lips such words are born
As can but Heaven or Hell confer
Bid Love be still nor ever speak
Lest he his own rejection seek

Herbert P Horne 1864


THE LOVERS SONG

Lend me thy fillet Love
I would no longer see
Cover mine eyelids close awhile
And make me blind like thee

Then might I pass her sunny face
And know not it was fair
Then might I hear her voice nor guess
Her starry eyes were there

Ah banished so from stars and sun 
Why need it be my fate
If only she might dream me good
And wise and be my mate

Lend her thy fillet Love
Let her no longer see
If there is hope for me at all
She must be blind like thee

Edward Rowland Sill 18411887


WHEN FIRST I SAW HER

When first I saw her at the stroke
The heart of nature in me spoke
The very landscape smiled more sweet
Lit by her eyes pressed by her feet
She made the stars of heaven more bright
By sleeping under them at night
And fairer made the flowers of May
By being lovelier than they

O soft soft where the sunshine spread
Dark in the grass I laid my head
And let the lights of earth depart
To find her image in my heart
Then through my being came and went
Tones of some heavenly instrument
As if where its blind motions roll
The world should wake and be a soul

George Edward Woodberry 18551930


MY APRIL LADY

When down the stair at morning
The sunbeams round her float
Sweet rivulets of laughter
Are rippling in her throat
The gladness of her greeting
Is gold without alloy
And in the morning sunlight
I think her name is Joy

When in the evening twilight
The quiet bookroom lies
We read the sad old ballads
While from her hidden eyes
The tears are falling falling
That give her heart relief
And in the evening twilight
I think her name is Grief

My little April lady
Of sunshine and of showers
She weaves the old spring magic
And breaks my heart in flowers
But when her moods are ended
She nestles like a dove
Then by the pain and rapture
I know her name is Love

Henry Van Dyke 18521933


THE MILKMAID
A New Song To An Old Tune

Across the grass I see her pass
She comes with tripping pace 
A maid I know  and March winds blow
Her hair across her face 
With a hey Dolly ho Dolly
Dolly shall be mine
Before the spray is white with May
Or blooms the eglantine

The March winds blow I watch her go
Her eye is brown and clear
Her cheek is brown and soft as down
To those who see it near 
With a hey Dolly ho Dolly
Dolly shall be mine
Before the spray is white with May
Or blooms the eglantine

What has she not that those have got 
The dames that walk in silk
If she undo her kerchief blue
Her neck is white as milk
With a hey Dolly ho Dolly
Dolly shall be mine
Before the spray is white with May
Or blooms the eglantine

Let those who will be proud and chill
For me from June to June
My Dollys words are sweet as curds 
Her laugh is like a tune 
With a hey Dolly ho Dolly
Dolly shall be mine
Before the spray is white with May
Or blooms the eglantine

Break break to hear O crocusspear
O tall Lentlilies flame
Therell be a bride at Eastertide
And Dolly is her name
With a hey Dolly ho Dolly
Dolly shall be mine
Before the spray is white with May
Or blooms the eglantine

Austin Dobson 18401921


SONG

This peach is pink with such a pink
As suits the peach divinely
The cunning color rarely spread
Fades to the yellow finely
But where to spy the truest pink
Is in my Loves soft cheek I think

The snowdrop child of windy March
Doth glory in her whiteness
Her golden neighbors crocuses
Unenvious praise her brightness
But I do know where out of sight
My sweetheart keeps a warmer white

Norman Gale 1862


IN FEBRUARY

My Ladys birthday crowns the growing year
A flower of Spring before the Spring is here
To sing of her and this fair day to keep
The very Loves forsake their Winter sleep
Whereer she goes their circling wings they spread
And shower celestial roses oer her head
I too would chant her worth and dare to raise
A hymn to whats beyond immortal praise
Go little verse and lay in vesture meet
Of poesy my homage at her feet

Henry Simpson 1868


LOVE I MARVEL WHAT YOU ARE

Love I marvel what you are
Heaven in a pearl of dew
Lilies hearted with a star 
All are you

Spring along your forehead shines
And the summer blooms your breast
Graces of autumnal vines
Round you rest

Birds about a limpid rose
Making song and light of wing
While the warm wind sunny blows 
So you sing

Darling if the little dust
That I know is merely I
Have availed to win your trust
Let me die

Trumbull Stickney 18741904


BALLADE OF MY LADYS BEAUTY

Squire Adam had two wives they say
Two wives had he for his delight
He kissed and clypt them all the day
And clypt and kissed them all the night
Now Eve like ocean foam was white
And Lilith roses dipped in wine
But though they were a goodly sight
No lady is so fair as mine

To Venus some folk tribute pay
And Queen of Beauty she is hight
And Sainte Marie the world doth sway
In cerule napery bedight
My wonderment these twain invite
Their comeliness it is divine
And yet I say in their despite
No lady is so fair as mine

Dame Helen caused a grievous fray
For love of her brave men did fight
The eyes of her made sages fey
And put their hearts in woeful plight
To her no rhymes will I indite
For her no garlands will I twine
Though she be made of flowers and light
No lady is so fair as mine

LENVOI
Prince Eros Lord of lovely might
Who on Olympus doth recline
Do I not tell the truth aright
No lady is so fair as mine

Joyce Kilmer 18861918


URSULA

I see her in the festal warmth tonight
Her rest all grace her motion all delight
Endowed with all the womans arts that please
In her soft gown she seems a thing of ease
Whom sorrow may not reach or evil blight

Tomorrow she will toil from floor to floor
To smile upon the unreplying poor
To stay the tears of widows and to be
Confessor to mens erring hearts    ah me
She knows not I am beggar at her door

Robert Underwood Johnson 1853


VILLANELLE OF HIS LADYS TREASURES

I took her dainty eyes as well
As silken tendrils of her hair
And so I made a Villanelle

I took her voice a silver bell
As clear as song as soft as prayer
I took her dainty eyes as well

It may be said I who can tell
These things shall be my less despair
And so I made a Villanelle

I took her whiteness virginal
And from her cheeks two roses rare
I took her dainty eyes as well

I said It may be possible
Her image from my heart to tear
And so I made a Villanelle

I stole her laugh most musical
I wrought it in with artful care
I took her dainty eyes as well
And so I made a Villanelle

Ernest Dowson 18671900


SONG

Love by that loosened hair
Well now I know
Where the lost Lilith went
So long ago

Love by those starry eyes
I understand
How the sea maidens lure
Mortals from land

Love by that welling laugh
Joy claims his own
Seaborn and windwayward
Child of the sun

Bliss Carman 18611929


SONG

O like a queens her happy tread
And like a queens her golden head
But O at last when all is said
Her womans heart for me

We wandered where the river gleamed
Neath oaks that mused and pines that dreamed
A wild thing of the woods she seemed
So proud and pure and free

All heaven drew nigh to hear her sing
When from her lips her soul took wing
The oaks forgot their pondering
The pines their reverie

And O her happy queenly tread
And O her queenly golden head
But O her heart when all is said
Her womans heart for me

William Watson 18581935


ANY LOVER ANY LASS

Why are her eyes so bright so bright
Why do her lips control
The kisses of a summer night
When I would love her soul

God set her brave eyes wide apart
And painted them with fire
They stir the ashes of my heart
To embers of desire

Her lips so tenderly are wrought
In so divine a shape
That I am servant to my thought
And can no wise escape

Her body is a flower her hair
About her neck doth play
I find her colors everywhere
They are the pride of day

Her little hands are soft and when
I see her fingers move
I know in very truth that men
Have died for less than love

Ah dear live lovely thing my eyes
Have sought her like a prayer
It is my better self that cries
Would she were not so fair

Would I might forfeit ecstasy
And find a calmer place
Where I might undesirous see
Her too desired face

Nor find her eyes so bright so bright
Nor hear her lips unroll
Dream after dream the lifelong night
When I would love her soul

Richard Middleton 18821911


SONGS ASCENDING

Love has been sung a thousand ways 
So let it be
The songs ascending in your praise
Through all my days
Are three

Your cloudwhite body first I sing
Your love was heavens blue
And I a bird flew carolling
In ring on ring
Of you

Your nearness is the second song
When God began to be
And bound you strongly right or wrong
With his own thong
To me

But oh the song eternal high
That tops these two 
You live forever you who die
I am not I
But you

Witter Bynner 1881


SONG

Oh Love they said is King of Kings
And Triumph is his crown
Earth fades in flame before his wings
And Sun and Moon bow down 
But that I knew would never do
And Heaven is all too high
So whenever I meet a Queen I said
I will not catch her eye

Oh Love they said and Love they said
The gift of Love is this
A crown of thorns about thy head
And vinegar to thy kiss 
But Tragedy is not for me
And Im content to be gay
So whenever I spied a Tragic Lady
I went another way

And so I never feared to see
You wander down the street
Or come across the fields to me
On ordinary feet
For what theyd never told me of
And what I never knew
It was that all the time my love
Love would be merely you

Rupert Brooke 18871915


SONG

How do I love you
I do not know
Only because of you
Gladly I go

Only because of you
Labor is sweet
And all the song of you
Sings in my feet

Only the thought of you
Trembles and lies
Just where the world begins 
Under my eyes

Irene Rutherford McLeod 1891


TO   IN CHURCH

If I was drawn here from a distant place
Twas not to pray nor hear our friends address
But gazing once more on your winsome face
To worship there Ideal Loveliness
On that pure shrine that has too long ignored
The gifts that once I brought so frequently
I lay this votive offering to record
How sweet your quiet beauty seemed to me
Enchanting girl my faith is not a thing
By futile prayers and vapid psalmsinging
To vent in crowded nave and public pew
My creed is simple that the world is fair
And beauty the best thing to worship there
And I confess it by adoring you

Alan Seeger 18881916


AFTER TWO YEARS

She is all so slight
And tender and white
As a May morning
She walks without hood
At dusk It is good
To hear her sing

It is Gods will
That I shall love her still
As He loves Mary
And night and day
I will go forth to pray
That she love me

She is as gold
Lovely and far more cold
Do thou pray with me
For if I win grace
To kiss twice her face
God has done well to me

Richard Aldington 1892


PRAISE

Dear they are praising your beauty
The grass and the sky
The sky in a silence of wonder
The grass in a sigh

I too would sing for your praising
Dearest had I
Speech as the whispering grass
Or the silent sky

These have an art for the praising
Beauty so high
Sweet you are praised in a silence
Sung in a sigh

Seumas OSullivan 1879







PLAINTS AND PROTESTATIONS






FORGET NOT YET
 The Lover Beseecheth His Mistress
 Not To Forget His Steadfast Faith
 And True Intent

Forget not yet the tried intent
Of such a truth as I have meant
My great travail so gladly spent
Forget not yet

Forget not yet when first began
The weary life ye know since when
The suit the service none tell can
Forget not yet

Forget not yet the great assays
The cruel wrong the scornful ways
The painful patience in delays
Forget not yet

Forget not O forget not this 
How long ago hath been and is
The mind that never meant amiss 
Forget not yet

Forget not then thine own approved
The which so long hath thee so loved
Whose steadfast faith yet never moved
Forget not this

Thomas Wyatt 15031542


FAWNIA
From Pandosto

Ah were she pitiful as she is fair
Or but as mild as she is seeming so
Then were my hopes greater than my despair
Then all the world were heaven nothing woe

Ah were her heart relenting as her hand
That seems to melt even with the mildest touch
Then knew I where to seat me in a land
Under wide heavens but yet there is not such
So as she shows she seems the budding rose
Yet sweeter far than is an earthly flower
Sovereign of beauty like the spray she grows
Compassed she is with thorns and cankered flower
Yet were she willing to be plucked and worn
She would be gathered though she grew on thorn

Ah when she sings all music else be still
For none must be compared to her note
Neer breathed such glee from Philomelas bill
Nor from the morningsingers swelling throat
Ah when she riseth from her blissful bed
She comforts all the world as doth the sun
And at her sight the nights foul vapors fled
When she is set the gladsome day is done
O glorious sun imagine me the west
Shine in my arms and set thou in my breast

Robert Greene 15601592


THE PASSIONATE SHEPHERD TO HIS LOVE

Come live with me and be my Love
And we will all the pleasures prove
That hills and valleys dales and fields
Or woods or steepy mountain yields

And we will sit upon the rocks
And see the shepherds feed their flocks
By shallow rivers to whose falls
Melodious birds sing madrigals

And I will make thee beds of roses
And a thousand fragrant posies
A cap of flowers and a kirtle
Embroidered all with leaves of myrtle

A gown made of the finest wool
Which from our pretty lambs we pull
Fairlined slippers for the cold
With buckles of the purest gold

A belt of straw and ivybuds
With coral clasps and amber studs
And if these pleasures may thee move
Come live with me and be my Love

The shepherd swains shall dance and sing
For thy delight each May morning
If these delights thy mind may move
Then live with me and be my Love

Christopher Marlowe 15641593


THE NYMPHS REPLY TO THE PASSIONATE SHEPHERD

If all the world and love were young
And truth in every shepherds tongue
These pretty pleasures might me move
To live with thee and be thy Love

But Time drives flocks from field to fold
When rivers rage and rocks grow cold
And Philomel becometh dumb
The rest complains of cares to come

The flowers do fade and wanton fields
To wayward Winter reckoning yields
A honey tongue a heart of gall
Is fancys spring but sorrows fall

Thy gowns thy shoes thy beds of roses
Thy cap thy kirtle and thy posies
Soon break soon wither  soon forgotten
In folly ripe in reason rotten

Thy belt of straw and ivybuds
Thy coral clasps and amber studs 
All these in me no means can move
To come to thee and be thy Love

But could youth last and love still breed
Had joys no date nor age no need
Then these delights my mind might move
To live with thee and be thy Love

Walter Raleigh 15521618


WRONG NOT SWEET EMPRESS OF MY HEART

Wrong not sweet empress of my heart
The merit of true passion
With thinking that he feels no smart
That sues for no compassion

Silence in love bewrays more woe
Than words though neer so witty
A beggar that is dumb you know
May challenge double pity

Then wrong not dearest to my heart
My true though secret passion
He smarteth most that hides his smart
And sues for no compassion

Walter Raleigh 15521618


TO HIS COY LOVE

I pray thee leave love me no more
Call home the heart you gave me
I but in vain that saint adore
That can but will not save me
These poor halfkisses kill me quite 
Was ever man thus served
Amidst an ocean of delight
For pleasure to be starved

Show me no more those snowy breasts
With azure riverets branched
Where whilst mine eye with plenty feasts
Yet is my thirst not stanched
O Tantalus thy pains neer tell
By me thou art prevented
Tis nothing to be plagued in Hell
But thus in Heaven tormented

Clip me no more in those dear arms
Nor thy lifes comfort call me
O these are but too powerful charms
And do but more enthral me
But see how patient I am grown
In all this coil about thee
Come nice thing let my heart alone
I cannot live without thee

Michael Drayton 15631631


HER SACRED BOWER

Where she her sacred bower adorns
The rivers clearly flow
The groves and meadows swell with flowers
The winds all gently blow
Her sunlike beauty shines so fair
Her spring can never fade
Who then can blame the life that strives
To harbor in her shade

Her grace I sought her love I wooed
Her love thought to obtain
No time no toil no vow no faith
Her wished grace can gain
Yet truth can tell my heart is hers
And her will I adore
And from that love when I depart
Let heaven view me no more

Her roses with my prayers shall spring
And when her trees I praise
Their boughs shall blossom mellow fruit
Shall strew her pleasant ways
The words of hearty zeal have power
High wonders to effect
O why should then her princely ear
My words or zeal neglect

If she my faith misdeems or worth
Woe worth my hapless fate
For though time can my truth reveal
That time will come too late
And who can glory in the worth
That cannot yield him grace
Content in everything is not
Nor joy in every place

But from her Bower of Joy since I
Must now excluded be
And she will not relieve my cares
Which none can help but she
My comfort in her love shall dwell
Her love lodge in my breast
And though not in her bower yet I
Shall in her temple rest

Thomas Campion   1619


TO LESBIA
After Catullus

My sweetest Lesbia let us live and love
And though the sager sort our deeds reprove
Let us not weigh them Heavens great lamps do dive
Into their west and straight again revive
But soon as once set is our little light
Then must we sleep one everduring night

If all would lead their lives in love like me
Then bloody swords and armor should not be
No drum nor trumpet peaceful sleeps should move
Unless alarm came from the Camp of Love
But fools do live and waste their little light
And seek with pain their everduring night

When timely death my life and fortune ends
Let not my hearse be vexed with mourning friends
But let all lovers rich in triumph come
And with sweet pastimes grace my happy tomb
And Lesbia close up thou my little light
And crown with love my everduring night

Thomas Campion   1619


LOVE ME OR NOT

Love me or not love her I must or die
Leave her or not follow her needs must I
O that her grace would my wished comforts give
How rich in her how happy should I live

All my desire all my delight should be
Her to enjoy her to unite to me
Envy should cease her would I love alone
Who loves by looks is seldom true to one

Could I enchant and that it lawful were
Her would I charm softly that none should hear
But love enforced rarely yields firm content
So would I love that neither should repent

Thomas Campion   1619


THERE IS NONE O NONE BUT YOU

There is none O none but you
That from me estrange the sight
Whom mine eyes affect to view
And chained ears hear with delight

Other beauties others move
In you I all graces find
Such is the effect of Love
To make them happy that are kind

Women in frail beauty trust
Only seem you fair to me
Still prove truly kind and just
For that may not dissembled be

Sweet afford me then your sight
That surveying all your looks
Endless volumes I may write
And fill the world with envied books

Which when afterages view
All shall wonder and despair 
Woman to find a man so true
Or man a woman half so fair

Thomas Campion   1619


OF CORINNAS SINGING

When to her lute Corinna sings
Her voice revives the leaden strings
And doth in highest notes appear
As any challenged echo clear
But when she doth of mourning speak
Een with her sighs the strings do break

And as her lute doth live or die
Led by her passion so must I
For when of pleasure she doth sing
My thoughts enjoy a sudden spring
But if she doth of sorrow speak
Een from my heart the strings do break

Thomas Campion   1619


WERE MY HEART AS SOME MENS ARE

Were my heart as some mens are thy errors would not move me
But thy faults I curious find and speak because I love thee
Patience is a thing divine and far I grant above me

Foes sometimes befriend us more our blacker deeds objecting
Than the obsequious bosomguest with false respect affecting
Friendship is the Glass of Truth our hidden stains detecting

When I use of eyes enjoy and inward light of reason
Thy observer will I be and censor but in season
Hidden mischief to conceal in State and Love is treason

Thomas Campion   1619


KIND ARE HER ANSWERS

Kind are her answers
But her performance keeps no day
Breaks time as dancers
From their own music when they stray
All her free favors
And smooth words wing my hopes in vain
O did ever voice so sweet but only feign
Can true love yield such delay
Converting joy to pain

Lost is our freedom
When we submit to women so
Why do we need em
When in their best they work our woe
There is no wisdom
Can alter ends by fate prefixed
O why is the good of man with evil mixed
Never were days yet called two
But one night went betwixt

Thomas Campion   1619


TO CELIA
From The Forest

Drink to me only with thine eyes
And I will pledge with mine
Or leave a kiss but in the cup
And Ill not look for wine
The thirst that from the soul doth rise
Doth ask a drink divine
But might I of Joves nectar sup
I would not change for thine

I sent thee late a rosy wreath
Not so much honoring thee
As giving it a hope that there
It could not withered be
But thou thereon didst only breathe
And sentst it back to me
Since when it grows and smells I swear
Not of itself but thee

Ben Jonson 15731637


SONG
From The Forest

O do not wanton with those eyes
Lest I be sick with seeing
Nor cast them down but let them rise
Lest shame destroy their being

O be not angry with those fires
For then their threats will kill me
Nor look too kind on my desires
For then my hopes will spill me

O do not steep them in thy tears
For so will sorrow slay me
Nor spread them as distract with fears
Mine own enough betray me

Ben Jonson 15731637


SONG

Go and catch a falling star
Get with child a mandrake root
Tell me where all past years are
Or who cleft the Devils foot
Teach me to hear mermaids singing
Or to keep off envys stinging
And find
What wind
Serves to advance an honest mind

If thou best born to strange sights
Things invisible go see
Ride ten thousand days and nights
Till Age snow white hairs on thee
Thou when thou returnst wilt tell me
All strange wonders that befell thee
And swear
No where
Lives a woman true and fair

If thou findst one let me know
Such a pilgrimage were sweet
Yet do not I would not go
Though at next door we might meet
Though she were true when you met her
And last till you write your letter
Yet she
Will be
False ere I come to two or three

John Donne 15731631


THE MESSAGE

Send home my longstrayed eyes to me
Which O too long have dwelt on thee
But if from you theyve learned such ill
To sweetly smile
And then beguile
Keep the deceivers keep them still

Send home my harmless heart again
Which no unworthy thought could stain
But if it has been taught by thine
To forfeit both
Its word and oath
Keep it for then tis none of mine

Yet send me back my heart and eyes
For Ill know all thy falsities
That I one day may laugh when thou
Shalt grieve and mourn 
Of one the scorn
Who proves as false as thou art now

John Donne 15731631


SONG

Ladies though to your conquering eyes
Love owes his chiefest victories
And borrows those bright arms from you
With which he does the world subdue
Yet you yourselves are not above
The empire nor the griefs of love

Then rack not lovers with disdain
Lest Love on you revenge their pain
You are not free because youre fair
The Boy did not his Mother spare
Beautys but an offensive dart
It is no armor for the heart

George Etherege 16351691


TO A LADY ASKING HIM HOW LONG HE WOULD LOVE HER

It is not Celia in our power
To say how long our love will last
It may be we within this hour
May lose those joys we now do taste
The Blessed that immortal be
From change in love are only free

Then since we mortal lovers are
Ask not how long our love will last
But while it does let us take care
Each minute be with pleasure passed
Were it not madness to deny
To live because were sure to die

George Etherege 16351691


TO AENONE

What conscience say is it in thee
When I a heart had one
To take away that heart from me
And to retain thy own

For shame or pity now incline
To play a loving part
Either to send me kindly thine
Or give me back my heart

Covet not both but if thou dost
Resolve to part with neither
Why yet to show that thou art just
Take me and mine together

Robert Herrick 15911674


TO ANTHEA WHO MAY COMMAND HIM ANYTHING

Bid me to live and I will live
Thy Protestant to be
Or bid me love and I will give
A loving heart to thee

A heart as soft a heart as kind
A heart as sound and free
As in the whole world thou canst find
That heart Ill give to thee

Bid that heart stay and it will stay
To honor thy decree
Or bid it languish quite away
And t shall do so for thee

Bid me to weep and I will weep
While I have eyes to see
And having none yet will I keep
A heart to weep for thee

Bid me despair and Ill despair
Under that cypress tree
Or bid me die and I will dare
Een death to die for thee

Thou art my life my love my heart
The very eyes of me
And hast command of every part
To live and die for thee

Robert Herrick 15911674


THE BRACELET TO JULIA

Why I tie about thy wrist
Julia this silken twist
For what other reason ist
But to show thee how in part
Thou my pretty captive art
But thy bondslave is my heart
Tis but silk that bindeth thee
Snap the thread and thou art free
But tis otherwise with me
I am bound and fast bound so
That from thee I cannot go
If I could I would not so

Robert Herrick 15911674


TO THE WESTERN WIND

Sweet western wind whose luck it is
Made rival with the air
To give Perennas lip a kiss
And fan her wanton hair

Bring me but one Ill promise thee
Instead of common showers
Thy wings shall be embalmed by me
And all beset with flowers

Robert Herrick 15911674


TO MY INCONSTANT MISTRESS

When thou poor Excommunicate
From all the joys of Love shalt see
The full reward and glorious fate
Which my strong faith shall purchase me
Then curse thine own Inconstancy

A fairer hand than thine shall cure
That heart which thy false oaths did wound
And to my soul a soul more pure
Than thine shall by Loves hand be bound
And both with equal glory crowned

Then shalt thou weep entreat complain
To Love as I did once to thee
When all thy tears shall be as vain
As mine were then for thou shalt be
Damned for thy false Apostasy

Thomas Carew 15981639


PERSUASIONS TO ENJOY

If the quick spirits in your eye
Now languish and anon must die
If every sweet and every grace
Must fly from that forsaken face
Then Celia let us reap our joys
Ere Time such goodly fruit destroys

Or if that golden fleece must grow
For ever free from aged snow
If those bright suns must know no shade
Nor your fresh beauties ever fade
Then fear not Celia to bestow
What still being gathered still must grow

Thus either Time his sickle brings
In vain or else in vain his wings

Thomas Carew 15981639


MEDIOCRITY IN LOVE REJECTED

Give me more love or more disdain
The torrid or the frozen zone
Bring equal ease unto my pain
The temperate affords me none
Either extreme of love or hate
Is sweeter than a calm estate

Give me a storm if it be love
Like Danae in that golden shower
Ill swim in pleasure if it prove
Disdain that torrent will devour
My vulturehopes and hes possessed
Of heaven thats but from hell released

Then crown my joys or cure my pain
Give me more love or more disdain

Thomas Carew 15981639


THE MESSAGE

Ye little birds that sit and sing
Amidst the shady valleys
And see how Phillis sweetly walks
Within her gardenalleys
Go pretty birds about her bower
Sing pretty birds she may not lower
Ah me methinks I see her frown
Ye pretty wantons warble

Go tell her through your chirping bills
As you by me are bidden
To her is only known my love
Which from the world is hidden
Go pretty birds and tell her so
See that your notes strain not too low
For still methinks I see her frown
Ye pretty wantons warble

Go tune your voices harmony
And sing I am her lover
Strain loud and sweet that every note
With sweet content may move her
And she that hath the sweetest voice
Tell her I will not change my choice
 Yet still methinks I see her frown
Ye pretty wantons warble

O fly make haste see see she falls
Into a pretty slumber
Sing round about her rosy bed
That waking she may wonder
Say to her tis her lover true
That sendeth love to you to you
And when you hear her kind reply
Return with pleasant warblings

Thomas Heywood   1650


HOW CAN THE HEART FORGET HER

At her fair hands how have I grace entreated
With prayers oft repeated
Yet still my love is thwarted
Heart let her go for shell not be converted 
Say shall she go
O no no no no no
She is most fair though she be marblehearted

How often have my sighs declared my anguish
Wherein I daily languish
Yet still she doth procure it
Heart let her go for I cannot endure it 
Say shall she go
O no no no no no
She gave the wound and she alone must cure it

But shall I still a true affection owe her
Which prayers sighs tears do show her
And shall she still disdain me
Heart let her go if they no grace can gain me 
Say shall she go
O no no no no no
She made me hers and hers she will retain me

But if the love that hath and still doth burn me
No love at length return me
Out of my thoughts Ill set her
Heart let her go O heart I pray thee let her
Say shall she go
O no no no no no
Fixed in the heart how can the heart forget her

Francis Davison fl 1602


TO ROSES IN THE BOSOM OF CASTARA

Ye blushing virgins happy are
In the chaste nunnery of her breasts 
For hed profane so chaste a fair
Whoeer should call them Cupids nests

Transplanted thus how bright ye grow
How rich a perfume do ye yield
In some close garden cowslips so
Are sweeter than in the open field

In those white cloisters live secure
From the rude blasts of wanton breath 
Each hour more innocent and pure
Till you shall wither into death

Then that which living gave you room
Your glorious sepulcher shall be
There wants no marble for a tomb
Whose breast hath marble been to me

William Habington 16051654


TO FLAVIA

Tis not your beauty can engage
My wary heart
The sun in all his pride and rage
Has not that art
And yet he shines as bright as you
If brightness could our souls subdue

Tis not the pretty things you say
Nor those you write
Which can make Thyrsis heart your prey
For that delight
The graces of a welltaught mind
In some of our own sex we find

No Flavia tis your love I fear
Loves surest darts
Those which so seldom fail him are
Headed with hearts
Their very shadows make us yield
Dissemble well and win the field

Edmund Waller 16061687


LOVE NOT ME FOR COMELY GRACE

Love not me for comely grace
For my pleasing eye or face
Nor for any outward part
No nor for a constant heart
For these may fail or turn to ill
So thou and I shall sever
Keep therefore a true womans eye
And love me still but know not why
So hast thou the same reason still
To doat upon me ever

Unknown


WHEN DEAREST I BUT THINK OF THEE

When dearest I but think of thee
Methinks all things that lovely be
Are present and my soul delighted
For beauties that from worth arise
Are like the grace of deities
Still present with us though unsighted

Thus while I sit and sigh the day
With all his borrowed lights away
Till nights black wings do overtake me
Thinking on thee thy beauties then
As sudden lights do sleepy men
So they by their bright rays awake me

Thus absence dies and dying proves
No absence can subsist with loves
That do partake of fair perfection
Since in the darkest night they may
By their quick motion find a way
To see each other by reflection

The waving sea can with each flood
Bathe some high promont that hath stood
Far from the main up in the river
O think not then but love can do
As much for thats an ocean too
Which flows not every day but ever

John Suckling 16091642
or Owen Felltham 16021668


A DOUBT OF MARTYRDOM

O for some honest lovers ghost
Some kind unbodied post
Sent from the shades below
I strangely long to know
Whether the noble chaplets wear
Those that their mistress scorn did bear
Or those that were used kindly

For whatsoeer they tell us here
To make those sufferings dear
Twill there I fear be found
That to the being crowned
To have loved alone will not suffice
Unless we also have been wise
And have our loves enjoyed

What posture can we think him in
That here unloved again
Departs ands thither gone
Where each sits by his own
Or how can that Elysium be
Where I my mistress still must see
Circled in others arms

For there the judges all are just
And Sophonisba must
Be his whom she held dear
Not his who loved her here
The sweet Philoclea since she died
Lies by her Pirocles his side
Not by Amphialus

Some bays perchance or myrtle bough
For difference crowns the brow
Of those kind souls that were
The noble martyrs here
And if that be the only odds
As who can tell ye kinder gods
Give me the woman here

John Suckling 16091642


TO CHLOE
Who For His Sake Wished Herself Younger

Chloe why wish you that your years
Would backwards run till they meet mine
That perfect likeness which endears
Things unto things might us combine
Our ages so in date agree
That twins do differ more than we

There are two births the one when light
First strikes the new awakened sense
The other when two souls unite
And we must count our life from thence
When you loved me and I loved you
Then both of us were born anew

Love then to us new souls did give
And in those souls did plant new powers
Since when another life we live
The breath we breathe is his not ours
Love makes those young whom age doth chill
And whom he finds young keeps young still

Love like that angel that shall call
Our bodies from the silent grave
Unto one age doth raise us all
None too much none too little have
Nay that the difference may be none
He makes two not alike but one

And now since you and I are such
Tell me whats yours and what is mine
Our eyes our ears our taste smell touch
Do like our souls in one combine
So by this I as well may be
Too old for you as you for me

William Cartwright 16111643


Ill NEVER LOVE THEE MORE

My dear and only Love I pray
This little world of thee
Be governed by no other sway
Than purest monarchy
For if confusion have a part
Which virtuous souls abhor
And hold a synod in thy heart
Ill never love thee more

Like Alexander I will reign
And I will reign alone
My thoughts did evermore disdain
A rival on my throne
He either fears his fate too much
Or his deserts are small
That dares not put it to the touch
To gain or lose it all

But I must rule and govern still
And always give the law
And have each subject at my will
And all to stand in awe
But gainst my batteries if I find
Thou kick or vex me sore
As that thou set me up a blind
Ill never love thee more

Or in the empire of thy heart
Where I should solely be
If others do pretend a part
And dare to vie with me
Or if committees thou erect
And go on such a score
Ill laugh and sing at thy neglect
And never love thee more

But if thou wilt be faithful then
And constant of thy word
Ill make thee glorious by my pen
And famous by my sword
Ill serve thee in such noble ways
Were never heard before
Ill crown and deck thee all with bays
And love thee evermore

James Graham 16121650


TO ALTHEA FROM PRISON

When Love with unconfined wings
Hovers within my gates
And my divine Althea brings
To whisper at the grates
When I lie tangled in her hair
And fettered to her eye
The birds that wanton in the air
Know no such liberty

When flowing cups run swiftly round
With no allaying Thames
Our careless heads with roses bound
Our hearts with loyal flames
When thirsty grief in wine we steep
When healths and draughts go free 
Fishes that tipple in the deep
Know no such liberty

When like committed linnets I
With shriller throat shall sing
The sweetness mercy majesty
And glories of my King
When I shall voice aloud how good
He is how great should be
Enlarged winds that curl the flood
Know no such liberty

Stone walls do not a prison make
Nor iron bars a cage
Minds innocent and quiet take
That for an hermitage
If I have freedom in my love
And in my soul am free
Angels alone that soar above
Enjoy such liberty

Richard Lovelace 16181658


WHY I LOVE HER

Tis not her birth her friends nor yet her treasure
Nor do I covet her for sensual pleasure
Nor for that old morality
Do I love her cause she loves me

Sure he that loves his lady cause shes fair
Delights his eye so loves himself not her
Something there is moves me to love and I
Do know I love but know not how nor why

Alexander Brome 16201666


TO HIS COY MISTRESS

Had we but world enough and time
This coyness Lady were no crime
We would sit down and think which way
To walk and pass our long loves day
Thou by the Indian Ganges side
Shouldst rubies find I by the tide
Of Humber would complain I would
Love you ten years before the Flood
And you should if you please refuse
Till the conversion of the Jews
My vegetable love should grow
Vaster than empires and more slow
An hundred years should go to praise
Thine eyes and on thy forehead gaze
Two hundred to adore each breast
But thirty thousand to the rest
An age at least to every part
And the last age should show your heart
For Lady you deserve this state
Nor would I love at lower rate
But at my back I always hear
Times winged chariot hurrying near
And yonder all before us lie
Deserts of vast eternity
Thy beauty shall no more be found
Nor in thy marble vault shall sound
My echoing song then worms shall try
That long preserved virginity
And your quaint honor turn to dust
And into ashes all my lust
The graves a fine and private place
But none I think do there embrace
Now therefore while the youthful hue
Sits on thy skin like morning dew
And while thy willing soul transpires
At every pore with instant fires
Now let us sport us while we may
And now like amorous birds of prey
Rather at once our time devour
Than languish in his slowchapt power
Let us roll all our strength and all
Our sweetness up into one ball
And tear our pleasures with rough strife
Through the iron gates of life
Thus though we cannot make our sun
Stand still yet we will make him run

Andrew Marvell 16211678


A DEPOSITION FROM BEAUTY

Though when I loved thee thou wert fair
Thou art no longer so
These glories all the pride they wear
Unto opinion owe
Beauties like stars in borrowed luster shine
And twas my love that gave thee thine

The flames that dwelt within thine eye
Do now with mine expire
Thy brightest graces fade and die
At once with my desire
Loves fires thus mutual influence return
Thine cease to shine when mine to burn

Then proud Celinda hope no more
To be implored or wooed
Since by thy scorn thou dost restore
Thy wealth my love bestowed
And thy despised disdain too late shall find
That none are fair but who are kind

Thomas Stanley 16251678


LOVE IN THY YOUTH FAIR MAID

Love in thy youth fair maid be wise
Old Time will make thee colder
And though each morning new arise
Yet we each day grow older

Thou as heaven art fair and young
Thine eyes like twin stars shining
But ere another day be sprung
All these will be declining

Then winter comes with all his fears
And all thy sweets shall borrow
Too late then wilt thou shower thy tears
And I too late shall sorrow

Unknown


TO CELIA

When Celia must my old day set
And my young morning rise
In beams of joy so bright as yet
Neer blessed a lovers eyes
My state is more advanced than when
I first attempted thee
I sued to be a servant then
But now to be made free

Ive served my time faithful and true
Expecting to be placed
In happy freedom as my due
To all the joys thou hast
Ill husbandry in love is such
A scandal to loves power
We ought not to misspend so much
As one poor shortlived hour

Yet think not sweet Im weary grown
That I pretend such haste
Since none to surfeit eer was known
Before he had a taste
My infant love could humbly wait
When young it scarce knew how
To plead but grown to mans estate
He is impatient now

Charles Cotton 16301687


TO CELIA

Not Celia that I juster am
Or better than the rest
For I would change each hour like them
Were not my heart at rest

But I am tied to very thee
By every thought I have
Thy face I only care to see
Thy heart I only crave

All that in woman is adored
In thy dear self I find 
For the whole sex can but afford
The handsome and the kind

Why then should I seek further store
And still make love anew
When change itself can give no more
Tis easy to be true

Charles Sedley 16391701


A SONG

My dear mistress has a heart
Soft as those kind looks she gave me
When with loves restless art
And her eyes she did enslave me
But her constancys so weak
Shes so wild and apt to wander
That my jealous heart would break
Should we live one day asunder

Melting joys about her move
Killing pleasures wounding blisses
She can dress her eyes in love
And her lips can arm with kisses
Angels listen when she speaks
Shes my delight all mankinds wonder
But my jealous heart would break
Should we live one day asunder

John Wilmot 16471680


LOVE AND LIFE

All my past life is mine no more
The flying hours are gone
Like transitory dreams given oer
Whose images are kept in store
By memory alone

The time that is to come is not
How can it then be mine
The present moments all my lot
And that as fast as it is got
Phillis is only thine

Then talk not of inconstancy
False hearts and broken vows
If I by miracle can be
This livelong minute true to thee
Tis all that Heaven allows

John Wilmot 16471680


CONSTANCY

I cannot change as others do
Though you unjustly scorn
Since that poor swain that sighs for you
For you alone was born
No Phillis no your heart to move
A surer way Ill try
And to revenge my slighted love
Will still live on will still live on and die

When killed with grief Amyntas lies
And you to mind shall call
The sighs that now unpitied rise
The tears that vainly fall 
That welcome hour that ends this smart
Will then begin your pain
For such a faithful tender heart
Can never break can never break in vain

John Wilmot 16471680


SONG

Too late alas I must confess
You need not arts to move me
Such charms by nature you possess
Twere madness not to love ye

Then spare a heart you may surprise
And give my tongue the glory
To boast though my unfaithful eyes
Betray a tender story

John Wilmot 16471680


SONG

Come Celia lets agree at last
To love and live in quiet
Lets tie the knot so very fast
That time shall neer untie it
Loves dearest joys they never prove
Who free from quarrels live
Tis sure a god like part of love
Each other to forgive

When least I seemed concerned I took
No pleasure nor had rest
And when I feigned an angry look
Alas I loved you best
Say but the same to me youll find
How blest will be our fate
Sure to be grateful to be kind
Can never be too late

John Sheffield 16481721


THE ENCHANTMENT

I did but look and love awhile
Twas but for one halfhour
Then to resist I had no will
And now I have no power

To sigh and wish is all my ease
Sighs which do heat impart
Enough to melt the coldest ice
Yet cannot warm your heart

O would your pity give my heart
One corner of your breast
Twould learn of yours the winning art
And quickly steal the rest

Thomas Otway 16521685


SONG

Only tell her that I love
Leave the rest to her and Fate
Some kind planet from above
May perhaps her pity move
Lovers on their stars must wait 
Only tell her that I love

Why O why should I despair
Mercys pictured in her eye
If she once vouchsafe to hear
Welcome Hope and farewell Fear
Shes too good to let me die 
Why O why should I despair

John Cutts 16611707


FALSE THOUGH SHE BE

False though she be to me and love
Ill neer pursue revenge
For still the charmer I approve
Though I deplore her change

In hours of bliss we oft have met
They could not always last
And though the present I regret
Im grateful for the past

William Congreve 16701729


TO SILVIA
From The Cautious Lovers

Silvia let us from the crowd retire
For what to you and me
Who but each other do desire
Is all that here we see

Apart well live though not alone
For who alone can call
Those who in deserts live with one
If in that one theyve all

The world a vast meander is
Where hearts confusedly stray
Where few do hit whilst thousands miss
The happy mutual way

Anne Finch  1720


WHY LOVELY CHARMER

Why lovely charmer tell me why
So very kind and yet so shy
Why does that cold forbidding air
Give damps of sorrow and despair
Or why that smile my soul subdue
And kindle up my flames anew

In vain you strive with all your art
By turns to fire and freeze my heart
When I behold a face so fair
So sweet a look so soft an air
My ravished soul is charmed all oer
I cannot love thee less or more

Unknown


AGAINST INDIFFERENCE

More love or more disdain I crave
Sweet be not still indifferent
O send me quickly to my grave
Or else afford me more content
Or love or hate me more or less
For love abhors all lukewarmness

Give me a tempest if twill drive
Me to the place where I would be
Or if youll have me still alive
Confess you will be kind to me
Give hopes of bliss or dig my grave
More love or more disdain I crave

Charles Webbe c 1678


A SONG TO AMORET

If I were dead and in my place
Some fresher youth designed
To warm thee with new fires and grace
Those arms I left behind

Were he as faithful as the Sun
Thats wedded to the Sphere
His blood as chaste and temperate run
As Aprils mildest tear

Or were he rich and with his heap
And spacious share of earth
Could make divine affection cheap
And court his golden birth

For all these arts Id not believe
No though he should be thine
The mighty Amorist could give
So rich a heart as mine

Fortune and beauty thou mightst find
And greater men than I
But my true resolved mind
They never shall come nigh

For I not for an hour did love
Or for a day desire
But with my soul had from above
This endless holy fire

Henry Vaughan 16221695


THE LASS OF RICHMOND HILL

On Richmond Hill there lives a lass
More bright than Mayday morn
Whose charms all other maids surpass 
A rose without a thorn

This lass so neat with smiles so sweet
Has won my right goodwill
Id crowns resign to call her mine
Sweet lass of Richmond Hill

Ye zephyrs gay that fan the air
And wanton through the grove
O whisper to my charming fair
I die for her I love

How happy will the shepherd be
Who calls this nymph his own
O may her choice be fixed on me
Mines fixed on her alone

James Upton 16701749


SONG
From Sunday Up the River

Let my voice ring out and over the earth
Through all the grief and strife
With a golden joy in a silver mirth
Thank God for life

Let my voice swell out through the great abyss
To the azure dome above
With a chord of faith in the harp of bliss
Thank God for Love

Let my voice thrill out beneath and above
The whole world through
O my Love and Life O my Life and Love
Thank God for you

James Thomson 18341882


GIFTS
From Sunday Up the River

Give a man a horse he can ride
Give a man a boat he can sail
And his rank and wealth his strength and health
On sea nor shore shall fail

Give a man a pipe he can smoke
Give a man a book he can read
And his home is bright with a calm delight
Though the room be poor indeed

Give a man a girl he can love
As I O my love love thee
And his heart is great with the pulse of Fate
At home on land on sea

James Thomson 18341882


AMYNTA

My sheep I neglected I broke my sheepcrook
And all the gay haunts of my youth I forsook
No more for Amynta fresh garlands I wove
For ambition I said would soon cure me of love

Oh what had my youth with ambition to do
Why left I Amynta Why broke I my vow
Oh give me my sheep and my sheephook restore
And Ill wander from love and Amynta no more

Through regions remote in vain do I rove
And bid the wide ocean secure me from love
O fool to imagine that aught could subdue
A love so well founded a passion so true

Alas tis too late at thy fate to repine
Poor shepherd Amynta can never be thine
Thy tears are all fruitless thy wishes are vain
The moments neglected return not again

Gilbert Elliot 17221777


O NANCY WILT THOU GO WITH ME

O Nancy wilt thou go with me
Nor sigh to leave the flaunting town
Can silent glens have charms for thee
The lowly cot the russet gown
No longer dressed in silken sheen
No longer decked with jewels rare
Say canst thou quit each courtly scene
Where thou wert fairest of the fair

O Nancy when thourt far away
Wilt thou not cast a wish behind
Say canst thou face the parching ray
Nor shrink before the wintry wind
O can that soft and gentle mien
Extremes of hardship learn to bear
Nor sad regret each courtly scene
Where thou wert fairest of the fair

O Nancy canst thou love so true
Through perils keen with me to go
Or when thy swain mishap shall rue
To share with him the pang of woe
Say should disease or pain befall
Wilt thou assume the nurses care
Nor wistful those gay scenes recall
Where thou wert fairest of the fair

And when at last thy love shall die
Wilt thou receive his parting breath
Wilt thou repress each struggling sigh
And cheer with smiles the bed of death
And wilt thou oer his breathless clay
Strew flowers and drop the tender tear
Nor then regret those scenes so gay
Where thou wert fairest of the fair

Thomas Percy 17291811


CAVALIERS SONG

If doughty deeds my lady please
Right soon Ill mount my steed
And strong his arm and fast his seat
That bears frae me the meed
Ill wear thy colors in my cap
Thy picture in my heart
And he that bends not to thine eye
Shall rue it to his smart
Then tell me how to woo thee Love
O tell me how to woo thee
For thy dear sake nae care Ill take
Though neer another trow me

If gay attire delight thine eye
Ill dight me in array
Ill tend thy chamber door all night
And squire thee all the day
If sweetest sounds can win thine ear
These sounds Ill strive to catch
Thy voice Ill steal to woo thysel
That voice that nane can match
Then tell me how to woo thee Love
O tell me how to woo thee
For thy dear sake nae care Ill take
Though neer another trow me

But if fond love thy heart can gain
I never broke a vow
Nae maiden lays her skaith to me
I never loved but you
For you alone I ride the ring
For you I wear the blue
For you alone I strive to sing
O tell me how to woo
Then tell me how to woo thee Love
O tell me how to woo thee
For thy dear sake nae care Ill take
Though neer another trow me

Robert CunninghameGraham  1797


MY HEART IS A LUTE

Alas that my heart is a lute
Whereon you have learned to play
For a many years it was mute
Until one summers day
You took it and touched it and made it thrill
And it thrills and throbs and quivers still

I had known you dear so long
Yet my heart did not tell me why
It should burst one morn into song
And wake to new life with a cry
Like a babe that sees the light of the sun
And for whom this great world has just begun

Your lute is enshrined cased in
Kept close with loves magic key
So no hand but yours can win
And wake it to minstrelsy
Yet leave it not silent too long nor alone
Lest the strings should break and the music be done

Anne Barnard 17501825


SONG
From The Duenna

Had I a heart for falsehood framed
I neer could injure you
For though your tongue no promise claimed
Your charms would make me true
Then lady dread not here deceit
Nor fear to suffer wrong
For friends in all the aged youll meet
And lovers in the young

But when they find that you have blessed
Another with your heart
Theyll bid aspiring passion rest
And act a brothers part
Then lady dread not here deceit
Nor fear to suffer wrong
For friends in all the aged youll meet
And brothers in the young

Richard Brinsley Sheridan 17511816


MEETING

My Damon was the first to wake
The gentle flame that cannot die
My Damon is the last to take
The faithful bosoms softest sigh
The life between is nothing worth
O cast it from thy thought away
Think of the day that gave it birth
And this its sweet returning day

Buried be all that has been done
Or say that naught is done amiss
For who the dangerous path can shun
In such bewildering world as this
But love can every fault forgive
Or with a tender look reprove
And now let naught in memory live
But that we meet and that we love

George Crabbe 17541832


O WERE MY LOVE YON LILAC FAIR

O were my Love yon lilac fair
Wi purple blossoms to the spring
And I a bird to shelter there
When wearied on my little wing
How I wad mourn when it was torn
By autumn wild and winter rude
But I wad sing on wanton wing
When youthfu May its bloom renewed

O gin my Love were yon red rose
That grows upon the castle wa
And I mysel a drap o dew
Into her bonnie breast to fa
O there beyond expression blest
Id feast on beauty a the night
Sealed on her silksaft faulds to rest
Till fleyed awa by Phoebus light

Robert Burns 17591796


BONNIE WEE THING

Bonnie wee thing cannie wee thing
Lovely wee thing wert thou mine
I wad wear thee in my bosom
Lest my jewel I should tine
Wishfully I look and languish
In that bonnie face o thine
And my heart it stounds wi anguish
Lest my wee thing be na mine

Wit and grace and love and beauty
In ae constellation shine
To adore thee is my duty
Goddess o this soul o mine
Bonnie wee thing cannie wee thing
Lovely wee thing wert thou mine
I wad wear thee in my bosom
Lest my jewel I should tine

Robert Burns 17591796


ROSE AYLMER

Ah what avails the sceptered race
Ah what the form divine
What every virtue every grace
Rose Aylmer all were thine

Rose Aylmer whom these wakeful eyes
May weep but never see
A night of memories and sighs
I consecrate to thee

Walter Savage Landor 17751864


TAKE BACK THE VIRGIN PAGE
Written On Returning A Blank Book

Take back the Virgin Page
White and unwritten still
Some hand more calm and sage
The leaf must fill
Thoughts came as pure as light 
Pure as even you require
But oh each word I write
Love turns to fire

Yet let me keep the book
Oft shall my heart renew
When on its leaves I look
Dear thoughts of you
Like you tis fair and bright
Like you too bright and fair
To let wild passion write
One wrong wish there

Haply when from those eyes
Far far away I roam
Should calmer thoughts arise
Towards you and home
Fancy may trace some line
Worthy those eyes to meet
Thoughts that not burn but shine
Pure calm and sweet

And as oer ocean far
Seamen their records keep
Led by some hidden star
Through the cold deep
So may the words I write
Tell through what storms I stray
You still the unseen light
Guiding my way

Thomas Moore 17791852


BELIEVE ME IF ALL THOSE ENDEARING YOUNG CHARMS

Believe me if all those endearing young charms
Which I gaze on so fondly today
Were to change by tomorrow and fleet in my arms
Like fairygifts fading away
Thou wouldst still be adored as this moment thou art
Let thy loveliness fade as it will
And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart
Would entwine itself verdantly still

It is not while beauty and youth are thine own
And thy cheeks unprofaned by a tear
That the fervor and faith of a soul may be known
To which time will but make thee more dear
No the heart that has truly loved never forgets
But as truly loves on to the close
As the sunflower turns to her god when he sets
The same look which she turned when he rose

Thomas Moore 17791852


THE NUN

If you become a nun dear
A friar I will be
In any cell you run dear
Pray look behind for me
The roses all turn pale too
The doves all take the veil too
The blind will see the show
What you become a nun my dear
Ill not believe it no

If you become a nun dear
The bishop Love will be
The Cupids every one dear
Will chant We trust in thee
The incense will go sighing
The candles fall adying
The water turn to wine
What you go take the vows my dear
You may  but theyll be mine

Leigh Hunt 17841859


ONLY OF THEE AND ME

Only of thee and me the night wind sings
Only of us the sailors speak at sea
The earth is filled with wondered whisperings
Only of thee and me

Only of thee and me the breakers chant
Only of us the stir in bush and tree
The rain and sunshine tell the eager plant
Only of thee and me

Only of thee and me till all shall fade
Only of us the whole worlds thoughts can be 
For we are Love and God Himself is made
Only of thee and me

Louis Untermeyer 1885


TO 

One word is too often profaned
For me to profane it
One feeling too falsely disdained
For thee to disdain it
One hope is too like despair
For prudence to smother
And Pity from thee more dear
Than that from another

I can give not what men call love
But wilt thou accept not
The worship the heart lifts above
And the Heavens reject not
The desire of the moth for the star
Of the night for the morrow
The devotion to something afar
From the sphere of our sorrow

Percy Bysshe Shelley 17921822


FROM THE ARABIC

My faint spirit was sitting in the light
Of thy looks my love
It panted for thee like the hind at noon
For the brooks my love
Thy barb whose hoofs outspeed the tempests flight
Bore thee far from me
My heart for my weak feet were weary soon
Did companion thee

Ah fleeter far than fleetest storm or steed
Or the death they bear
The heart which tender thought clothes like a dove
With the wings of care
In the battle in the darkness in the need
Shall mine cling to thee
Nor claim one smile for all the comfort love
It may bring to thee

Percy Bysshe Shelley 17921822


THE WANDERING KNIGHTS SONG

My ornaments are arms
My pastime is in war
My bed is cold upon the wold
My lamp yon star

My journeyings are long
My slumbers short and broken
From hill to hill I wander still
Kissing thy token

I ride from land to land
I sail from sea to sea
Some day more kind I fate may find
Some night kiss thee

John Gibson Lockhart 17941854


SONG

Loves on the highroad
Loves in the byroad 
Loves on the meadow and Loves in the mart
And down every byway
Where Ive taken my way
Ive met Love asmiling  for Loves in my heart

Dana Burnet 1888


THE SECRET LOVE

You and I have found the secret way
None can bar our love or say us nay
All the world may stare and never know
You and I are twined together so

You and I for all his vaunted width
Know the giant Space is but a myth
Over miles and miles of pure deceit
You and I have found our lips can meet

You and I have laughed the leagues apart
In the soft delight of heart to heart
If theres a gulf to meet or limit set
You and I have never found it yet

You and I have trod the backward way
To the happy heart of yesterday
To the love we felt in ages past
You and I have found it still to last

You and I have found the joy had birth
In the angel childhood of the earth
Hid within the heart of man and maid
You and I of Time are not afraid

You and I can mock his fabled wing
For a kiss is an immortal thing
And the throb wherein those old lips met
Is a living music in us yet

A E George William Russell 18671935


THE FLOWER OF BEAUTY

Sweet in her green dell the flower of beauty slumbers
Lulled by the faint breezes sighing through her hair
Sleeps she and hears not the melancholy numbers
Breathed to my sad lute amid the lonely air

Down from the high cliffs the rivulet is teeming
To wind round the willowbanks that lure him from above
Oh that in tears from my rocky prison streaming
I too could glide to the bower of my love

Ah where the woodbines with sleepy arms have wound her
Opes she her eyelids at the dream of my lay
Listening like the dove while the fountains echo round her
To her lost mates call in the forest far away

Come then my bird for the peace thou ever bearest
Still Heavens messenger of comfort be to me
Come this fond bosom my faithfulest my fairest
Bleeds with its deathwound  but deeper yet for thee

George Darley 17951846


MY SHARE OF THE WORLD

I am jealous I am true
Sick at heart for love of you
O my share of the world
I am cold O cold as stone
To all men save you alone

Seven times slower creeps the day
When your face is far away
O my share of the world
Seven times darker falls the night
When you gladden not my sight

Measureless my joy and pride
Would you choose me for your bride
O my share of the world
For your face is my delight
Morn and even noon and night

To the dance and to the wake
Still I go but for your sake
O my share of the world
Just to see your face awhile
Meet your eyes and win your smile

And the gay word on my lip
Never lets my secret slip
To my share of the world
Light my feet trip over the green 
But my heart cries in the keen

My poor mother sighs anew
When my looks go after you
O my share of the world
And my fathers brow grows black
When you smile and turn your back

I would part with wealth and ease
I would go beyond the seas
For my share of the world
I would leave my hearth and home
If he only whispered Come

Houseless under sun and dew
I would beg my bread with you
O my share of the world
Houseless in the snow and storm
Your hearts love would keep me warm

I would pray and I would crave
To be with you in the grave
O my share of the world
I would go through fire and flood
I would give up all but God
For my share of the world

Alice Furlong 1875


SONG

A lake and a fairy boat
To sail in the moonlight clear 
And merrily we would float
From the dragons that watch us here

Thy gown should be snowwhite silk
And strings of orient pearls
Like gossamers dipped in milk
Should twine with thy raven curls

Red rubies should deck thy hands
And diamonds be thy dower 
But fairies have broke their wands
And wishing has lost its power

Thomas Hood 17991845


SMILE AND NEVER HEED ME

Though when other maids stand by
I may deign thee no reply
Turn not then away and sigh 
Smile and never heed me

If our love indeed be such
As must thrill at every touch
Why should others learn as much 
Smile and never heed me

Even if with maiden pride
I should bid thee quit my side
Take this lesson for thy guide 
Smile and never heed me

But when stars and twilight meet
And the dew is falling sweet
And thou hearst my coming feet 
Then  thou then  mayst heed me

Charles Swain 18011874


ARE THEY NOT ALL MINISTERING SPIRITS

We see them not  we cannot hear
The music of their wing 
Yet know we that they sojourn near
The Angels of the spring

They glide along this lovely ground
When the first violet grows
Their graceful hands have just unbound
The zone of yonder rose

I gather it for thy dear breast
From stain and shadow free
That which an Angels touch hath blest
Is meet my love for thee

Robert Stephen Hawker 18031875


MAIDEN EYES

You never bade me hope tis true
I asked you not to swear
But I looked in those eyes of blue
And read a promise there

The vow should bind with maiden sighs
That maiden lips have spoken
But that which looks from maiden eyes
Should last of all be broken

Gerald Griffin 18031840


HALLOWED PLACES

I pass my days among the quiet places
Made sacred by your feet
The air is cool in the fresh woodland spaces
The meadows very sweet

The sunset fills the wide sky with its splendor
The glad birds greet the night
I stop and listen for a voice strong tender
I wait those dear eyes light

You are the heart of every gleam of glory
Your presence fills the air
About you gathers all the fair years story
I read you everywhere

Alice Freeman Palmer 18551902


THE LADYS YES

Yes I answered you last night
No this morning sir I say
Colors seen by candlelight
Will not look the same by day

When the viols played their best
Lamps above and laughs below
Love me sounded like a jest
Fit for yes or fit for no

Call me false or call me free
Vow whatever light may shine 
No man on your face shall see
Any grief for change on mine

Yet the sin is on us both
Time to dance is not to woo
Wooing light makes fickle troth
Scorn of me recoils on you

Learn to win a ladys faith
Nobly as the thing is high
Bravely as for life and death
With a loyal gravity

Lead her from the festive boards
Point her to the starry skies
Guard her by your truthful words
Pure from courtships flatteries

By your truth she shall be true
Ever true as wives of yore
And her yes once said to you
SHALL be Yes for evermore

Elizabeth Barrett Browning 18061861


SONG
From The Millers Daughter

It is the millers daughter
And she is grown so dear so dear
That I would be the jewel
That trembles in her ear
For hid in ringlets day and night
Id touch her neck so warm and white

And I would be the girdle
About her dainty dainty waist
And her heart would beat against me
In sorrow and in rest
And I should know if it beat right
Id clasp it round so close and tight

And I would be the necklace
And all day long to fall and rise
Upon her balmy bosom
With her laughter or her sighs
And I would lie so light so light
I scarce should be unclasped at night

Alfred Tennyson 18091892


LILIAN

Airy fairy Lilian
Flitting fairy Lilian
When I ask her if she love me
Clasps her tiny hand above me
Laughing all she can
Shell not tell me if she love me
Cruel little Lilian

When my passion seeks
Pleasance in lovesighs
She looking through and through me
Thoroughly to undo me
Smiling never speaks
So innocentarch so cunningsimple
From beneath her gathered wimple
Glancing with blackbeaded eyes
Till the lightning laughters dimple
The babyroses in her cheeks
Then away she flies

Prithee weep May Lilian
Gaiety without eclipse
Wearieth me May Lilian
Through my very heart it thrilleth
When from crimsonthreaded lips
Silvertreble laughter thrilleth
Prithee weep May Lilian

Praying all I can
If prayers will not hush thee
Airy Lilian
Like a roseleaf I will crush thee
Fairy Lilian

Alfred Tennyson 18091892


BUGLE SONG
From The Princess

The splendor falls on castle walls
And snowy summits old in story
The long light shakes across the lakes
And the wild cataract leaps in glory
Blow bugle blow set the wild echoes flying
Blow bugle answer echoes dying dying dying

O hark O hear how thin and clear
And thinner clearer farther going
O sweet and far from cliff and scar
The horns of Elfland faintly blowing
Blow let us hear the purple glens replying
Blow bugle answer echoes dying dying dying

O love they die in yon rich sky
They faint on hill or field or river
Our echoes roll from soul to soul
And grow for ever and for ever
Blow bugle blow set the wild echoes flying
And answer echoes answer dying dying dying

Alfred Tennyson 18091892


RONSARD TO HIS MISTRESS

Quand vous serez bien vieille le soir a la chandelle
Assise aupres du feu devisant et filant
Direz chantant mes vers en vous esmerveillant
Ronsard ma celebre du temps que jetois belle

Some winter night shut snugly in
Beside the fagot in the hall
I think I see you sit and spin
Surrounded by your maidens all
Old tales are told old songs are sung
Old days come back to memory
You say When I was fair and young
A poet sang of me

Theres not a maiden in your hall
Though tired and sleepy ever so
But wakes as you my name recall
And longs the history to know
And as the piteous tale is said
Of lady cold and lover true
Each musing carries it to bed
And sighs and envies you

Our ladys old and feeble now
Theyll say she once was fresh and fair
And yet she spurned her lovers vow
And heartless left him to despair
The lover lies in silent earth
No kindly mate the lady cheers
She sits beside a lonely hearth
With threescore and ten years

Ah dreary thoughts and dreams are those
But wherefore yield me to despair
While yet the poets bosom glows
While yet the dame is peerless fair
Sweet lady mine while yet tis time
Requite my passion and my truth
And gather in their blushing prime
The roses of your youth

William Makepeace Thackeray 18111863


WHEN YOU ARE OLD
After Pierre de Ronsard

When you are old and gray and full of sleep
And nodding by the fire take down this book
And slowly read and dream of the soft look
Your eyes had once and of their shadows deep

How many loved your moments of glad grace
And loved your beauty with love false or true
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you
And loved the sorrows of your changing face

And bending down beside the glowing bars
Murmur a little sadly how love fled
And paced upon the mountains overhead
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars

William Butler Yeats 1865


SONG
From Pippa Passes

Youll love me yet  and I can tarry
Your loves protracted growing
June reared that bunch of flowers you carry
From seeds of Aprils sowing

I plant a heartfull now some seed
At least is sure to strike
And yield  what youll not pluck indeed
Not love but may be like

Youll look at least on loves remains
A graves one violet
Your look  that pays a thousand pains
Whats death Youll love me yet

Robert Browning 18121889


LOVE IN A LIFE

Room after room
I hunt the house through
We inhabit together
Heart fear nothing for heart thou shalt find her 
Next time herself  not the trouble behind her
Left in the curtain the couchs perfume
As she brushed it the cornicewreath blossomed anew
Yon lookingglass gleamed at the wave of her feather

Yet the day wears
And door succeeds door
I try the fresh fortune 
Range the wide house from the wing to the center
Still the same chance she goes out as I enter
Spend my whole day in the quest  who cares
But tis twilight you see  with such suites to explore
Such closets to search such alcoves to importune

Robert Browning 18121889


LIFE IN A LOVE

Escape me
Never 
Beloved
While I am I and you are you
So long as the world contains us both
Me the loving and you the loth
While the one eludes must the other pursue
My life is a fault at last I fear
It seems too much like a fate indeed
Though I do my best I shall scarce succeed
But what if I fail of my purpose here
It is but to keep the nerves at strain
To dry ones eyes and laugh at a fall
And baffled get up and begin again 
So the chase takes up ones life thats all
While look but once from your farthest bound
At me so deep in the dust and dark
No sooner the old hope drops to ground
Than a new one straight to the selfsame mark
I shape me 
Ever
Removed

Robert Browning 18121889


THE WELCOME

Come in the evening or come in the morning
Come when youre looked for or come without warning
Kisses and welcome youll find here before you
And the oftener you come here the more Ill adore you
Light is my heart since the day we were plighted
Red is my cheek that they told me was blighted
The green of the trees looks far greener than ever
And the linnets are singing True lovers dont sever

Ill pull you sweet flowers to wear if you choose them 
Or after youve kissed them theyll lie on my bosom
Ill fetch from the mountain its breeze to inspire you
Ill fetch from my fancy a tale that wont tire you
Oh your steps like the rain to the summervexed farmer
Or saber and shield to a knight without armor
Ill sing you sweet songs till the stars rise above me
Then wandering Ill wish you in silence to love me

Well look through the trees at the cliff and the eyrie
Well tread round the rath on the track of the fairy
Well look on the stars and well list to the river
Till you ask of your darling what gift you can give her
Oh shell whisper you  Love as unchangeably beaming
And trust when in secret most tunefully streaming
Till the starlight of heaven above us shall quiver
As our souls flow in one down eternitys river

So come in the evening or come in the morning
Come when youre looked for or come without warning
Kisses and welcome youll find here before you
And the oftener you come here the more Ill adore you
Light is my heart since the day we were plighted
Red is my cheek that they told me was blighted
The green of the trees looks far greener than ever
And the linnets are singing True lovers dont sever

Thomas Osborne Davis 18141845


URANIA

She smiles and smiles and will not sigh
While we for hopeless passion die
Yet she could love those eyes declare
Were but men nobler than they are

Eagerly once her gracious ken
Was turned upon the sons of men
But light the serious visage grew 
She looked and smiled and saw them through

Our petty souls cur strutting wits
Our labored puny passionfits 
Ah may she scorn them still till we
Scorn them as bitterly as she

Yet show her once ye heavenly Powers
One of some worthier race than ours
One for whose sake she once might prove
How deeply she who scorns can love

His eyes be like the starry lights
His voice like sounds of summer nights
In all his lovely mien let pierce
The magic of the universe

And she to him will reach her hand
And gazing in his eyes will stand
And know her friend and weep for glee
And cry Long long Ive looked for thee

Then will she weep  with smiles till then
Coldly she mocks the sons of men
Till then her lovely eyes maintain
Their pure unwavering deep disdain

Matthew Arnold 18221888


THREE SHADOWS

I looked and saw your eyes in the shadow of your hair
As a traveler sees the stream in the shadow of the wood 
And I said My faint heart sighs ah me to linger there
To drink deep and to dream in that sweet solitude

I looked and saw your heart in the shadow of your eyes
As a seeker sees the gold in the shadow of the stream
And I said Ah me what art should win the immortal prize
Whose want must make life cold and Heaven a hollow dream

I looked and saw your love in the shadow of your heart
As a diver sees the pearl in the shadow of the sea
And I murmured not above my breath but all apart 
Ah you can love true girl and is your love for me

Dante Gabriel Rossetti 18281882


SINCE WE PARTED

Since we parted yester eve
I do love thee love believe
Twelve times dearer twelve hours longer 
One dream deeper one night stronger
One sun surer  thus much more
Than I loved thee love before

Edward Robert Bulwer Lytton 18311891


A MATCH

If love were what the rose is
And I were like the leaf
Our lives would grow together
In sad or singing weather
Blown fields or flowerful closes
Green pleasure or gray grief
If love were what the rose is
And I were like the leaf

If I were what the words are
And love were like the tune
With double sound and single
Delight our lips would mingle
With kisses glad as birds are
That get sweet rain at noon
If I were what the words are
And love were like the tune

If you were life my darling
And I your love were death
Wed shine and snow together
Ere March made sweet the weather
With daffodil and starling
And hours of fruitful breath
If you were life my darling
And I your love were death

If you were thrall to sorrow
And I were page to joy
Wed play for lives and seasons
With loving looks and treasons
And tears of night and morrow
And laughs of maid and boy
If you were thrall to sorrow
And I were page to joy

If you were Aprils lady
And I were lord in May
Wed throw with leaves for hours
And draw for days with flowers
Till day like night were shady
And night were bright like day
If you were Aprils lady
And I were lord in May

If you were queen of pleasure
And I were king of pain
Wed hunt down love together
Pluck out his flyingfeather
And teach his feet a measure
And find his mouth a rein
If you were queen of pleasure
And I were king of pain

Algernon Charles Swinburne 18371909


A BALLAD OF LIFE

I found in dreams a place of wind and flowers
Full of sweet trees and color of glad grass
In midst whereof there was
A lady clothed like summer with sweet hours
Her beauty fervent as a fiery moon
Made my blood burn and swoon
Like a flame rained upon
Sorrow had filled her shaken eyelids blue
And her mouths sad red heavy rose all through
Seemed sad with glad things gone

She held a little cithern by the strings
Shaped heartwise strung with subtlecolored hair
Of some dead lute player
That in dead years had done delicious things
The seven strings were named accordingly
The first string charity
The second tenderness
The rest were pleasure sorrow sleep and sin
And loving kindness that is pitys kin
And is most pitiless

There were three men with her each garmented
With gold and shod with gold upon the feet
And with plucked ears of wheat
The first mans hair was wound upon his head
His face was red and his mouth curled and sad
All his gold garment had
Pale stains of dust and rust
A riven hood was pulled across his eyes
The token of him being upon this wise
Made for a sign of Lust

The next was Shame with hollow heavy face
Colored like green wood when flame kindles it
He hath such feeble feet
They may not well endure in any place
His face was full of gray old miseries
And all his bloods increase
Was even increase of pain
The last was Fear that is akin to Death
He is Shames friend and always as Shame saith
Fear answers him again

My soul said in me This is marvelous
Seeing the airs face is not so delicate
Nor the suns grace so great
If sin and she be kin or amorous
And seeing where maidens served her on their knees
I bade one crave of these
To know the cause thereof
Then Fear said I am Pity that was dead
And Shame said I am Sorrow comforted
And Lust said I am Love

Thereat her hands began a luteplaying
And her sweet mouth a song in a strange tongue
And all the while she sung
There was no sound but long tears following
Long tears upon mens faces waxen white
With extreme sad delight
But those three following men
Became as men raised up among the dead
Great glad mouths open and fair cheeks made red
With childs blood come again

Then I said Now assuredly I see
My lady is perfect and transfigureth
All sin and sorrow and death
Making them fair as her own eyelids be
Or lips wherein my whole souls life abides
Or as her sweet white sides
And bosom carved to kiss
Now therefore if her pity further me
Doubtless for her sake all my days shall be
As righteous as she is

Forth ballad and take roses in both arms
Even till the top rose touch thee in the throat
Where the least thornprick harms
And girdled in thy golden singingcoat
Come thou before my lady and say this
Borgia thy gold hairs color burns in me
Thy mouth makes beat my blood in feverish rhymes
Therefore so many as these roses be
Kiss me so many times
Then it may be seeing how sweet she is
That she will stoop herself none otherwise
Than a blown vinebranch doth
And kiss thee with soft laughter on thine eyes
Ballad and on thy mouth

Algernon Charles Swinburne 18371909


A LEAVETAKING

Let us go hence my songs she will not hear
Let us go hence together without fear
Keep silence now for singing time is over
And over all old things and all things dear
She loves not you nor me as all we love her
Yea though we sang as angels in her ear
She would not hear

Let us rise up and part she will not know
Let us go seaward as the great winds go
Full of blown sand and foam what help is there
There is no help for all these things are so
And all the world is bitter as a tear
And how these things are though ye strove to show
She would not know

Let us go home and hence she will not weep
We gave love many dreams and days to keep
Flowers without scent and fruits that would not grow
Saying If thou wilt thrust in thy sickle and reap
All is reaped now no grass is left to mow
And we that sowed though all we fell on sleep
She would not weep

Let us go hence and rest she will not love
She shall not hear us if we sing hereof
Nor see loves ways how sore they are and steep
Come hence let be lie still it is enough
Love is a barren sea bitter and deep
And though she saw all heaven in flower above
She would not love

Let us give up go down she will not care
Though all the stars made gold of all the air
And the sea moving saw before it move
One moonflower making all the foamflowers fair
Though all those waves went over us and drove
Deep down the stifling lips and drowning hair
She would not care

Let us go hence go hence she will not see
Sing all once more together surely she
She too remembering days and words that were
Will turn a little towards us sighing but we
We are hence we are gone as though we had not been there
Nay and though all men seeing had pity on me
She would not see

Algernon Charles Swinburne 18371909


A LYRIC

Theres nae lark loves the lift my dear
Theres nae ship loves the sea
Theres nae bee loves the heatherbells
That loves as I love thee my love
That loves as I love thee

The whin shines fair upon the fell
The blithe broom on the lea
The muirside wind is merry at heart
Its a for love of thee my love
Its a for love of thee

Algernon Charles Swinburne 18371909


MAUREEN

O you plant the pain in my heart with your wistful eyes
Girl of my choice Maureen
Will you drive me mad for the kisses your shy sweet mouth denies
Maureen

Like a walking ghost I am and no words to woo
White rose of the West Maureen
For its pale you are and the fear on you is over me too
Maureen

Sure its one complaint thats on us asthore this day
Bride of my dreams Maureen
The smart of the bee that stung us his honey must cure they say
Maureen

Ill coax the light to your eyes and the rose to your face
Mavourneen my own Maureen
When I feel the warmth of your breast and your nest is my arms embrace
Maureen

O where was the King o the World that day  only me
My one true love Maureen
And you the Queen with me there and your throne in my heart machree
Maureen

John Todhunter 1839


A LOVE SYMPHONY

Along the garden ways just now
I heard the flowers speak
The white rose told me of your brow
The red rose of your cheek
The lily of your bended head
The bindweed of your hair
Each looked its loveliest and said
You were more fair

I went into the wood anon
And heard the wild birds sing
How sweet you were they warbled on
Piped trilled the selfsame thing
Thrush blackbird linnet without pause
The burden did repeat
And still began again because
You were more sweet

And then I went down to the sea
And heard it murmuring too
Part of an ancient mystery
All made of me and you
How many a thousand years ago
I loved and you were sweet 
Longer I could not stay and so
I fled back to your feet

Arthur OShaughnessy 18441881


LOVE ON THE MOUNTAIN

My love comes down from the mountain
Through the mists of dawn
I look and the star of the morning
From the sky is gone

My love comes down from the mountain
At dawn dewy sweet
Did you step from the star to the mountain
O little white feet

O whence came your twining tresses
And your shining eyes
But out of the gold of the morning
And the blue of the skies

The misty mountain is burning
In the suns red fire
And the heart in my breast is burning
And lost in desire

I follow you into the valley
But no word can I say
To the East or the West I will follow
Till the dusk of my day

Thomas Boyd 1867


KATE TEMPLES SONG

Only a touch and nothing more
Ah but never so touched before
Touch of lip was it Touch of hand
Either is easy to understand
Earth may be smitten with fire or frost 
Never the touch of true love lost

Only a word was it Scarce a word
Musical whisper softly heard
Syllabled nothing  just a breath 
Twill outlast life and twill laugh at death
Love with so little can do so much 
Only a word sweet Only a touch

Mortimer Collins 18271876


MY QUEEN

When and how shall I earliest meet her
What are the words she first will say
By what name shall I learn to greet her
I know not now it will come some day
With the selfsame sunlight shining upon her
Shining down on her ringlets sheen
She is standing somewhere  she I shall honor
She that I wait for my queen my queen

Whether her hair be golden or raven
Whether her eyes be hazel or blue
I know not now but twill be engraven
Some day hence as my loveliest hue
Many a girl I have loved for a minute
Worshipped many a face I have seen
Ever and aye there was something in it
Something that could not be hers my queen

I will not dream of her tall and stately
She that I love may be fairy light
I will not say she must move sedately 
Whatever she does it will then be right
She may be humble or proud my lady
Or that sweet calm which is just between
And whenever she comes she will find me ready
To do her homage my queen my queen

But she must be courteous she must be holy
Pure in her spirit this maiden I love
Whether her birth be noble or lowly
I care no more than the spirits above
But Ill give my heart to my ladys keeping
And ever her strength on mine shall lean
And the stars may fall and the saints be weeping
Ere I cease to love her my queen my queen

Unknown


DARLING TELL ME YES

One little minute more Maud
One little whisper more
I have a word to speak Maud
I never breathed before
What can it be but love Maud
And do I rightly guess
Tis pleasant to your ear Maud
O darling tell me yes

The burden of my heart Maud
Theres little need to tell
Theres little need to say Maud
Ive loved you long and well
Theres language in a sigh Maud
Ones meaning to express
And yours  was it for me Maud
O darling tell me yes

My eyes have told my love Maud
And on my burning cheek
Youve read the tender thought Maud
My lips refused to speak
I gave you all my heart Maud
Tis needless to confess
And did you give me yours Maud
O darling tell me yes

Tis sad to starve a love Maud
So worshipful and true
I know a little cot Maud
Quite large enough for two
And you will be my wife Maud
So may you ever bless
Through all your sunny life Maud
The day you answered yes

John Godfrey Saxe 18161877


DO I LOVE THEE

Do I love thee Ask the bee
If she loves the flowery lea
Where the honeysuckle blows
And the fragrant clover grows
As she answers Yes or No
Darling take my answer so

Do I love thee Ask the bird
When her matin song is heard
If she loves the sky so fair
Fleecy cloud and liquid air
As she answers Yes or No
Darling take my answer so

Do I love thee Ask the flower
If she loves the vernal shower
Or the kisses of the sun
Or the dew when day is done
As she answers Yes or No
Darling take my answer so

John Godfrey Saxe 18161887


O WORLD BE NOBLER

O world be nobler for her sake
If she but knew thee what thou art
What wrongs are borne what deeds are done
In thee beneath thy daily sun
Knowst thou not that her tender heart
For pain and very shame would break
O World be nobler for her sake

Laurence Binyon 1869


IN THE DARK IN THE DEW

In the dark in the dew
I am smiling back at you
But you cannot see the smile
And youre thinking all the while
How I turn my face from you
In the dark in the dew

In the dark in the dew
All my love goes out to you
Flutters like a bird in pain
Dies and comes to life again
While you whisper Sweetest hark
Someones sighing in the dark
In the dark in the dew

In the dark in the dew
All my heart cries out to you
As I cast it at your feet
Sweet indeed but not too sweet
Wondering will you hear it beat
Beat for you and bleed for you
In the dark in the dew

Mary Newmarch Prescott 18491888


NANNY

Oh for an hour when the day is breaking
Down by the shore where the tide is making
Fair as white cloud thou love near me
None but the waves and thyself to hear me
Oh to my breast how these arms would press thee
Wildly my heart in its joy would bless thee
Oh how the soul thou has won would woo thee
Girl of the snow neck closer to me

Oh for an hour as the day advances
Out where the breeze on the broombush dances
Watching the lark with the sunray oer us
Winging the notes of his Heaventaught chorus
Oh to be there and my love before me
Soft as a moonbeam smiling oer me
Thou wouldst but love and I would woo thee
Girl of the dark eye closer to me

Oh for an hour where the sun first found us
Out in the eve with its red sheets round us
Brushing the dew from the gales soft winglets
Pearly and sweet with thy long dark ringlets
Oh to be there on the sward beside thee
Telling my tale though I know youd chide me
Sweet were thy voice though it should undo me 
Girl of the dark locks closer to me

Oh for an hour by night or by day love
Just as the Heavens and thou might say love
Far from the stare of the coldeyed many
Bound in the breath of my dovesouled Nanny
Oh for the pure chains that have bound me
Warm from thy red lips circling round me
Oh in my soul as the light above me
Queen of the pure hearts do I love thee

Francis Davis 18101885


A TRIFLE

I know not why but even to me
My songs seem sweet when read to thee

Perhaps in this the pleasure lies 
I read my thoughts within thine eyes

And so dare fancy that my art
May sink as deeply as thy heart

Perhaps I love to make my words
Sing round thee like so many birds

Or maybe they are only sweet
As they seem offerings at thy feet

Or haply Lily when I speak
I think perchance they touch thy cheek

Or with a yet more precious bliss
Die on thy red lips in a kiss

Each reason here  I cannot tell 
Or all perhaps may solve the spell

But if she watch when I am by
Lily may deeper see than I

Henry Timrod 18291867


ROMANCE

I will make you brooches and toys for your delight
Of birdsong at morning and starshine at night
I will make a palace fit for you and me
Of green days in forests and blue days at sea

I will make my kitchen and you shall keep your room
Where white flows the river and bright blows the broom
And you shall wash your linen and keep your body white
In rainfall at morning and dewfall at night

And this shall be for music when no one else is near
The fine song for singing the rare song to hear
That only I remember that only you admire
Of the broad road that stretches and the roadside fire

Robert Louis Stevenson 18501894


OR EVER THE KNIGHTLY YEARS WERE GONE

Or ever the knightly years were gone
With the old world to the grave
I was a King in Babylon
And you were a Christian Slave

I saw I took I cast you by
I bent and broke your pride
You loved me well or I heard them lie
But your longing was denied
Surely I knew that by and by
You cursed your gods and died

And a myriad suns have set and shone
Since then upon the grave
Decreed by the King in Babylon
To her that had been his Slave

The pride I trampled is now my scathe
For it tramples me again
The old resentment lasts like death
For you love yet you refrain
I break my heart on your hard unfaith
And I break my heart in vain

Yet not for an hour do I wish undone
The deed beyond the grave
When I was a King in Babylon
And you were a Virgin Slave

William Ernest Henley 18491903


RUS IN URBE

Poets are singing the whole world over
Of May in melody joys for June
Dusting their feet in the careless clover
And filling their hearts with the blackbirds tune
The brown bright nightingale strikes with pity
The Sensitive heart of a count or clown
But where is the song for our leafy city
And where the rhymes for our lovely town

O for the Thames and its rippling reaches
Where almond rushes and breezes sport
Take me a walk under Burnham Beeches
Give me dinner at Hampton Court
Poets be still though your hearts I harden
Weve flowers by day and have scents at dark
The limes are in leaf in the cockney garden
And lilacs blossom in Regents Park

Come for a blow says a reckless fellow
Burned red and brown by passionate sun
Come to the downs where the gorse is yellow
The season of kisses has just begun
Come to the fields where bluebells shiver
Hear cuckoos carol or plaint of dove
Come for a row on the silent river
Come to the meadows and learn to love

Yes I will come when this wealth is over
Of softened color and perfect tone 
The lilacs better than fields of clover
Ill come when blossoming May has flown
When dust and dirt of a trampled city
Have dragged the yellow laburnum down
Ill take my holiday  mores the pity 
And turn my back upon London town

Margaret am I so wrong to love it
This misty town that your face shines through
A crown of blossom is waved above it
But heart and life of the whirl  tis you
Margaret pearl I have sought and found you
And though the paths of the wind are free
Ill follow the ways of the world around you
And build my nest on the nearest tree

Clement Scott 18411904


MY ROAD

Theres a road to heaven a road to hell
A road for the sick and one for the well
Theres a road for the false and a road for the true
But the road for me is the road to you

Theres a road through prairie and forest and glen
A road to each place in human ken
Theres a road over earth and a road over sea
But the road to you is the road for me

Theres a road for animal bird and beast
A road for the greatest a road for the least
Theres a road that is old and a road that is new
But the road for me is the road to you

Theres a road for the heart and a road for the soul
Theres a road for a part and a road for the whole
Theres a road for love  which few ever see 
Tis the road to you and the road for me

Oliver Opdyke 1878


A WHITE ROSE

The red rose whispers of passion
And the white rose breathes of love
Oh the red rose is a falcon
And the white rose is a dove

But I send you a cream white rosebud
With a flush on its petal tips
For the love that is purest and sweetest
Has a kiss of desire on the lips

John Boyle OReilly 18441890


SOME DAY OF DAYS

Some day some day of days threading the street
With idle heedless pace
Unlooking for such grace
I shall behold your face
Some day some day of days thus may we meet

Perchance the sun may shine from skies of May
Or winters icy chill
Touch whitely vale and hill
What matter I shall thrill
Through every vein with summer on that day

Once more lifes perfect youth will all come back
And for a moment there
I shall stand fresh and fair
And drop the garment care
Once more my perfect youth will nothing lack

I shut my eyes now thinking how twill be 
How face to face each soul
Will slip its long control
Forget the dismal dole
Of dreary Fates dark separating sea

And glance to glance and hand to hand in greeting
The past with all its fears
Its silences and tears
Its lonely yearning years
Shall vanish in the moment of that meeting

Nora Perry 18321896


THE TELEPHONE

When I was just as far as I could walk
From here today
There was an hour
All still
When leaning with my head against a flower
I heard you talk
Dont say I didnt for I heard you say 
You spoke from that flower on the window sill 
Do you remember what it was you said

First tell me what it was you thought you heard

Having found the flower and driven a bee away
I leaned my head
And holding by the stalk
I listened and I thought I caught the word 
What was it Did you call me by my name
Or did you say 
Someone said Come  I heard it as I bowed

I may have thought as much but not aloud

Well so I came

Robert Frost 1875


WHERE LOVE IS

By the rosy cliffs of Devon on a green hills crest
I would build me a house as a swallow builds its nest
I would curtain it with roses and the wind should breathe to me
The sweetness of the roses and the saltness of the sea

Where the Tuscan olives whiten in the hot blue day
I would hide me from the heat in a little hut of gray
While the singing of the husbandmen should scale my lattice green
From the golden rows of barley that the poppies blaze between

Narrow is the street Dear and dingy are the walls
Wherein you wait my coming as the twilight falls
All day with dreams I gild the grime till at your step I start 
Ah Love my country in your arms  my home upon your heart

Amelia Josephine Burr 1878


THAT DAY YOU CAME

Such special sweetness was about
That day God sent you here
I knew the lavender was out
And it was mid of year

Their common way the great winds blew
The ships sailed out to sea
Yet ere that day was spent I knew
Mine own had come to me

As after song some snatch of tune
Lurks still in grass or bough
So somewhat of the end o June
Lurks in each weather now

The young year sets the buds astir
The old year strips the trees
But ever in my lavender
I hear the brawling bees

Lizette Woodworth Reese 18561935


AMANTIUM IRAE

When this our rose is faded
And these our days are done
In lands profoundly shaded
From tempest and from sun
Ah once more come together
Shall we forgive the past
And safe from worldly weather
Possess our souls at last

Or in our place of shadows
Shall still we stretch a hand
To green remembered meadows
Of that old pleasant land
And vainly there foregathered
Shall we regret the sun
The rose of love ungathered
The bay we have not won

Ah child the worlds dark marges
May lead to Nevermore
The stately funeral barges
Sail for an unknown shore
And love we vow tomorrow
And pride we serve today
What if they both should borrow
Sad hues of yesterday

Our pride Ah should we miss it
Or will it serve at last
Our anger if we kiss it
Is like a sorrow past
While roses deck the garden
While yet the sun is high
Doff sorry pride for pardon
Or ever love go by

Ernest Dowson 18671900


IN A ROSE GARDEN

A hundred years from now dear heart
We shall not care at all
It will not matter then a whit
The honey or the gall
The summer days that we have known
Will all forgotten be and flown
The garden will be overgrown
Where now the roses fall

A hundred years from now dear heart
We shall not mind the pain
The throbbing crimson tide of life
Will not have left a stain
The song we sing together dear
The dream we dream together here
Will mean no more than means a tear
Amid a summer rain

A hundred years from now dear heart
The grief will all be oer
The sea of care will surge in vain
Upon a careless shore
These glasses we turn down today
Here at the parting of the way 
We shall be wineless then as they
And shall not mind it more

A hundred years from now dear heart
Well neither know nor care
What came of all lifes bitterness
Or followed loves despair
Then fill the glasses up again
And kiss me through the roseleaf rain
Well build one castle more in Spain
And dream one more dream there

John Bennett 1865


GOD BLESS YOU DEAR TODAY

If there be graveyards in the heart
From which no roses spring
A place of wrecks and old gray tombs
From which no birds take wing
Where linger buried hopes and dreams
Like ghosts among the graves
Why buried hopes are dismal things
And lonely ghosts are knaves

If there come dreary winter days
When summer roses fall
And lie forgot in withered drifts
Along the garden wall
If all the wreaths a lover weaves
Turn thorns upon the brow 
Then out upon the silly fool
Who makes not merry now

For if we cannot keep the past
Why care for whats to come
The instants prick is all that stings
And then the place is numb
If Lifes a lie and Loves a cheat
As I have heard men say
Then heres a health to fond deceit 
God bless you dear today

John Bennett 1865


TODAY

I bring you all my olden days
My childhoods morning glow
I love you down the meadow ways
Where early blossoms blow
And up deep lanes of longgoneby
Shining with dewdrops yet 
I wander still till you and I
Over the world are met

I bring you all my lonely days
My heart that hungered so
I love you through the wistful haze
Of autumns burning low
And on pale seas beneath wan sky
By weary tides beset
I voyage still till you and I
Over the world are met

I bring you all my happy days 
Armfuls of flowers  oh
I love you as the sunlight stays
On mountains heaped with snow
And where the dearest dreambuds lie
With tears and dewdrops wet
I toss today for you and I
Over the world are met

Benjamin R C Low 1880


TO ARCADY

Across the hills of Arcady
Into the Land of Song 
Ah dear if you will go with me
The way will not be long

It will not lead through solitudes
Of windblown woods or sea
Dear no the citys weariest moods
May scarce veil Arcady

Tis in no unfamiliar land
Lit by some distant star
No Arcady is where you stand
And Song is where you are

So walk but hand in hand with me 
No road can lead us wrong
These are the hills of Arcady 
Here is the Land of Song

Charles Buxton Going 1863


WILD WISHES

I wish because the sweetness of your passing
Makes all the earth a garden where you tread
That I might be the meanest of your roses
To pave your path with petals passionred

I wish because the softness of your breathing
Stirs the white jasmine at your window frame
That I might be the fragrance of a flower
To stir the night breeze with your dearest name

I wish because the glory of your dreaming
Strews all the field of heaven with throbbing stars
That I might storm the portals of your slumber
And soar with you beyond nights golden bars

I wish to be the day you die Beloved
Though at its close my foolish heart must break
But most of all I wish my dearest darling
To be the Blessed Morning when you wake

Ethel M Hewitt 18 


BECAUSE OF YOU

Sweet have I known the blossoms of the morning
Tenderly tinted to their hearts of dew
But now my flowers have found a fuller fragrance
Because of you

Long have I worshiped in my souls enshrining
High visions of the noble and the true 
Now all my aims and all my prayers are purer
Because of you

Wise have I seen the uses of lifes labor
To all its puzzles found some answering clue
But now my life has learned a nobler meaning
Because of you

In the past days I chafed at pain and waiting
Grasping at gladness as the children do
Now it is sweet to wait and joy to suffer
Because of you

In the long years of silences that part us
Dimmed by my tears and darkened to my view
Close shall I hold my memories and my madness
Because of you

Whether our lips shall touch or hands shall hunger
Whether our love be fed or joys be few
Life will be sweeter and more worth the living
Because of you

Sophia Almon Hensley 1866


THEN

I give thee treasures hour by hour
That oldtime princes asked in vain
And pined for in their useless power
Or died of passions eager pain

I give thee love as God gives light
Aside from merit or from prayer
Rejoicing in its own delight
And freer than the lavish air

I give thee prayers like jewels strung
On golden threads of hope and fear
And tenderer thoughts than ever hung
In a sad angels pitying tear

As earth pours freely to the sea
Her thousand streams of wealth untold
So flows my silent life to thee
Glad that its very sands are gold

What care I for thy carelessness
I give from depths that overflow
Regardless that their power to bless
Thy spirit cannot sound or know

Far lingering on a distant dawn
My triumph shines more sweet than late
When from these mortal mists withdrawn
Thy heart shall know me  I can wait

Rose Terry Cooke 18271892


THE MISSIVE

I that tremble at your feet
Am a rose
Nothing dewier or more sweet
Buds or blows
He that plucked me he that threw me
Breathed in fire his whole soul through me

How the cold air is infused
With the scent
See this satin leaf is bruised 
Bruised and bent
Lift me lift the wounded blossom
Soothe it at your rosier bosom

Frown not with averted eyes
Joys a flower
That is born a god and dies
In an hour
Take me for the Summer closes
And your life is but a roses

Edmund Gosse 18491928


PLYMOUTH HARBOR

Oh what know they of harbors
Who toss not on the sea
They tell of fairer havens
But none so fair there be

As Plymouth town outstretching
Her quiet arms to me
Her breasts broad welcome spreading
From Mewstone to Penlee

Ah with this homethought darling
Come crowding thoughts of thee
Oh what know they of harbors
Who toss not on the sea

Mrs Ernest Radford 1858


THE SERFS SECRET

I know a secret such a one
The hawthorn blossoms spiderspun
The dewdamp daisies in the grass
Laugh up to greet me as I pass
To meet the upland sun

It is that I would rather be
The little page on bended knee
Who stoops to gather up her train
Beneath the porchlamps ruby rain
Than hold a realm in fee

It is that in her scornful eye
Too hid for courtly sneer to spy
I saw one day a look which said
That I and only I might shed
Lovelight across her sky

I know a secret such a one
The hawthorn blossoms spiderspun
The dewdamp daisies in the grass
Laugh up to greet me as I pass
To meet the upland sun

William Vaughn Moody 18691910


O INEXPRESSIBLE AS SWEET

O inexpressible as sweet
Love takes my voice away
I cannot tell thee when we meet
What most I long to say

But hadst thou hearing in thy heart
To know what beats in mine
Then shouldst thou walk whereer thou art
In melodies divine

So warbling birds lift higher notes
Than to our ears belong
The music fills their throbbing throats
But silence steals the song

George Edward Woodberry 18551930


THE CYCLAMEN

Over the plains where Persian hosts
Laid down their lives for glory
Flutter the cyclamens like ghosts
That witness to their story
Oh fair Oh white Oh pure as snow
On countless graves how sweet they grow

Or crimson like the cruel wounds
From which the lifeblood flowing
Poured out where now on grassy mounds
The low soft winds are blowing
Oh fair Oh red Like blood of slain
Not even time can cleanse that stain

But when my dear these blossoms holds
All loveliness her dower
All woe and joy the past enfolds
In her find fullest flower
Oh fair Oh pure Oh white and red
If she but live what are the dead

Arlo Bates 18501918


THE WESTCOUNTRY LOVER

Then lady at last thou art sick of my sighing
Goodbye
So long as I sue thou wilt still be denying
Goodbye
Ah well shall I vow then to serve thee forever
And swear no unkindness our kinship can sever
Nay nay dear my lass heres an end of endeavor
Goodbye

Yet let no sweet ruth for my misery grieve thee
Goodbye
The man who has loved knows as well how to leave thee
Goodbye
The gorse is enkindled theres bloom on the heather
And love is my joy and so too is fair weather
I still ride abroad though we ride not together
Goodbye

My horse is my mate let the wind be my master
Goodbye
Though Care may pursue yet my hound follows faster
Goodbye
The red deers atremble in coverts unbroken
He hears the hoofthunder he scents the deathtoken
Shall I mope at home under vows never spoken
Goodbye

The brown earths my book and I ride forth to read it
Goodbye
The stream runneth fast but my will shall outspeed it
Goodbye
I love thee dear lass but I hate the hag Sorrow
As sun follows rain and tonight has its morrow
So Ill taste of joy though I steal beg or borrow
Goodbye

Alice Brown 1857


BE YE IN LOVE WITH APRILTIDE

Be ye in love with Apriltide
I faith in love am I
For now tis sun and now tis shower
And now tis frost and now tis flower
And now tis Laura laughingeyed
And now tis Laura shy

Ye doubtful days O slower glide
Still smile and frown O sky
Some beauty unforeseen I trace
In every change of Lauras face 
Be ye in love with Apriltide
I faith in love am I

Clinton Scollard 18601932


UNITY

Heart of my heart the world is young
Love lies hidden in every rose
Every song that the skylark sung
Once we thought must come to a close
Now we know the spirit of song
Song that is merged in the chant of the whole
Hand in hand as we wander along
What should we doubt of the years that roll

Heart of my heart we can not die
Love triumphant in flower and tree
Every life that laughs at the sky
Tells us nothing can cease to be
One we are one with a song today
One with the clover that scents the wold
One with the Unknown far away
One with the stars when earth grows old

Heart of my heart we are one with the wind
One with the clouds that are whirled oer the lea
One in many O broken and blind
One as the waves are at one with the sea
Ay when life seems scattered apart
Darkens ends as a tale that is told
One we are one O heart of my heart
One still one while the world grows old

Alfred Noyes 1880


THE QUEEN

He loves not well whose love is bold
I would not have thee come too nigh
The suns gold would not seem pure gold
Unless the sun were in the sky
To take him thence and chain him near
Would make his glory disappear

He keeps his state  keep thou in thine
And shine upon me from afar
So shall I bask in light divine
That falls from loves own guiding star
So shall thy eminence be high
And so my passion shall not die

But all my life shall reach its hands
Of lofty longing toward thy face
And be as one who speechless stands
In rapture at some perfect grace
My love my hope my all shall be
To look to heaven and look to thee

Thy eyes shall be the heavenly lights
Thy voice the gentle summer breeze 
What time it sways on moonlit nights
The murmuring tops of leafy trees
And I shall touch thy beauteous form
In Junes red roses rich and warm

But thou thyself shall come not down
From that pure region far above
But keep thy throne and wear thy crown
Queen of my heart and queen of love
A monarch in thy realm complete
And I a monarch  at thy feet

William Winter 18361917


A LOVERS ENVY

I envy every flower that blows
Beside the pathway where she goes
And every bird that sings to her
And every breeze that brings to her
The fragrance of the rose

I envy every poets rhyme
That moves her heart at eventime
And every tree that wears for her
Its brightest bloom and bears for her
The fruitage of its prime

I envy every Southern night
That paves her path with moonbeams white
And silvers all the leaves for her
And in their shadow weaves for her
A dream of dear delight

I envy none whose love requires
Of her a gift a task that tires
I only long to live to her
I only ask to give to her
All that her heart desires

Henry Van Dyke 18521933


STAR SONG

When sunset flows into golden glows
And the breath of the night is new
Love find afar eves eager star 
That is my thought of you

O tearwet eye that scans the sky
Your lonely lattice through
Choose any one from sun to sun 
That is my thought of you

And when you wake at the mornings break
To rival rose and dew
The star that stays till the leaping rays 
That is my thought of you

Ay though by day they seem away
Beyond or cloud or blue
From dawn to night unquenched their light 
As are my thoughts of you

Robert Underwood Johnson 1853


MY HEART SHALL BE THY GARDEN

My heart shall be thy garden Come my own
Into thy garden thine be happy hours
Among my fairest thoughts my tallest flowers
From root to crowning petal thine alone
Thine is the place from where the seeds are sown
Up to the sky inclosed with all its showers
But ah the birds the birds Who shall build bowers
To keep these thine O friend the birds have flown

For as these come and go and quit our pine
To follow the sweet season or newcorners
Sing one song only from our aldertrees
My heart has thoughts which though thine eyes hold mine
Flit to the silent world and other summers
With wings that dip beyond the silver seas

Alice Meynell 18531922


AT NIGHT

Home home from the horizon far and clear
Hither the soft wings sweep
Flocks of the memories of the day draw near
The dovecote doors of sleep

Oh which are they that come through sweetest light
Of all these homing birds
Which with the straightest and the swiftest flight
Your words to me your words

Alice Meynell 18501922


SONG

Song is so old
Love is so new 
Let me be still
And kneel to you

Let me be still
And breathe no word
Save what my warm blood
Sings unheard

Let my warm blood
Sing low of you 
Song is so fair
Love is so new

Hermann Hagedorn 1882


ALL LAST NIGHT

All last night I had quiet
In a fragrant dream and warm
She had become my Sabbath
And round my neck her arm

I knew the warmth in my dreaming
The fragrance I suppose
Was her hair about me
Or else she wore a rose

Her hair I think for likest
Woodruffe twas when Spring
Loitering down wet woodways
Treads it sauntering

No light nor any speaking
Fragrant only and warm
Enough to know my lodging
The white Sabbath of her arm

Lascelles Abercrombie 1881


THE LAST WORD

When I have folded up this tent
And laid the soiled thing by
I shall go forth neath different stars
Under an unknown sky

And yet whatever house I find
Beneath the grass or snow
Will neer be tenantless of love
Or lack the face I know

O lips  wild roses wet with rain
Blown hair of drifted brown
O passionate eyes O panting heart 
When in that colder town

I lie the one inhabitant
My hands across my breast
How warm through all eternity
The summer of my rest

To each frail root beneath the ground
That thrusts its flower above
I shall impart a fiercer sap 
I who have known your love

And growing things will lean to me
To learn what love hath won
Till I shall whisper to the dust
That secret of the Sun

Yea though my spirit never wake
To hear the voice I knew
Even an endless sleep would be
Stirred by the dreams of You

Frederic Lawrence Knowles 18691905


HEART OF MY HEART

Heart of my heart my life my light
If you were lost what should I do
I dare not let you from my sight
Lest Death should fall in love with you

Such countless terrors lie in wait
The gods know well how dear you are
What if they left me desolate
And plucked and set you for their star

Then hold me close the gods are strong
And perfect joy so rare a flower
No man may hope to keep it long 
And I may lose you any hour

Then kiss me close my star my flower
So shall the future grant me this
That there was not a single hour
We might have kissed and did not kiss

Unknown

Amelie Rives 1863


THE SHADED POOL

A laughing knot of village maids
Goes gaily tripping to the brook
For waternymphs they mean to be
And seek some still secluded nook
Here Laura goes my own delight
And Colins love the madcap Jane
And half a score of goddesses
Trip over daisies in the plain
Already now they loose their hair
And peep from out the tangled gold
Or speed the flying foot to reach
The brook thats only summercold
The lovely locks stream out behind
The shepherdesses on the wing
And Lauras is the wealth I love
And Lauras is the gold I sing

Arow upon the bank they pant
And all unlace the country shoe
Their fingers tug the garterknots
To loose the hose of varied hue
The flashing knee at last appears
The lower curves of youth and grace
Whereat the girls intently scan
The mazy thickets of the place
But whos to see except the thrush
Upon the wild crabapple tree
Within his branchy haunt he sits 
A very Peeping Tom is he
Now music bubbles in his throat
And now he pipes the scene in song 
The virgins slipping from their robes
The cheated stockings lean and long
The swiftdescending petticoat
The breasts that heave because they ran
The rounded arms the brilliant limbs
The pretty necklaces of tan
Did ever amorous God in Greece
In search of some young mouth to kiss
By any river chance upon
A sylvan scene as bright as this
But though each maid is pure and fair
For one alone my heart I bring
And Lauras is the shape I love
And Lauras is the snow I sing

And now upon the brooks green brink
A milkwhite bevy lo they stand
Half shy half frightened reaching back
The beauty of a poising hand
How musical their little screams
When ripples kiss their shrinking feet
And then the brook embraces all
Till gold and white and water meet
Within the streamlets soft cool arms
Delight and love and gracefulness
Sport till a flock of tiny waves
Swamps all the beds of floating cress
And on his shining face are seen
Great yellow lilies drifting down
Beyond the ringing appletree
Beyond the empty homespun gown
Did ever Orpheus with his lute
When making melody of old
Eer find a stream in Attica
So ripely full of pink and gold

At last they climb the sloping bank
And shake upon the thirsty soil
A treasury of diamonddrops
Not gained by aught of grimy toil
Again the garters clasp the hose
Again the velvet knee is hid
Again the breathless babble tells
What Colin said what Colin did
In grace upon the grass they lie
And spread their tresses to the sun
And rival musical as they
The blackbirds alto shake and run
Did ever Love on hunting bent
Come idly humming through the hay
And to his sudden joyfulness
Find fairer game at close of day
Though every maids a lilyrose
And meet to sway a sceptred king
Yet Lauras is the face I love
And Lauras are the lips I sing

Norman Gale 1862

GOODNIGHT

Goodnight Goodnight Ah good the night
That wraps thee in its silver light
Goodnight No night is good for me
That does not hold a thought of thee
Goodnight

Goodnight Be every night as sweet
As that which made our love complete
Till that last night when death shall be
One brief Goodnight for thee and me
Goodnight

S Weir Mitchell 18291914


THE MYSTIC

By seven vineyards on one hill
We walked The native wine
In clusters grew beside us two
For your lips and for mine

When Hark you said  Was that a bell
Or a bubbling spring we heard
But I was wise and closed my eyes
And listened to a bird

For as summer leaves are bent and shake
With singers passing through
So moves in me continually
The winged breath of you

You tasted from a single vine
And took from that your fill 
But I inclined to every kind
All seven on one hill

Witter Bynner 1881


I AM THE WIND

I am the wind that wavers
You are the certain land
I am the shadow that passes
Over the sand

I am the leaf that quivers
You the unshaken tree
You are the stars that are steadfast
I am the sea

You are the light eternal
Like a torch I shall die
You are the surge of deep music
I  but a cry

Zoe Akins 1886


I LOVE MY LIFE BUT NOT TOO WELL

I love my life but not too well
To give it to thee like a flower
So it may pleasure thee to dwell
Deep in its perfume but an hour
I love my life but not too well

I love my life but not too well
To sing it note by note away
So to thy soul the song may tell
The beauty of the desolate day
I love my life but not too well

I love my life but not too well
To cast it like a cloak on thine
Against the storms that sound and swell
Between thy lonely heart and mine
I love my life but not too well

Harriet Monroe 18601936


THIS IS MY LOVE FOR YOU

I have brought the wine
And the folded raiment fine
Pilgrim staff and shoe 
This is my love for you

I will smooth your bed
Lay away your coverlid
Sing the whole day through
This is my love for you

Mayhap in the night
When the dark beats back the light
I shall struggle too   
This is my love for you

In your dream once more
Will a star lead to my door
To stars and dreams be true
This is my love for you   

Grace Fallow Norton 1876







MY LADYS LIPS






LIPS AND EYES
From Blurt Master Constable

Love for such a cherry lip
Would be glad to pawn his arrows
Venus here to take a sip
Would sell her doves and team of sparrows
But they shall not so
Hey nonny nonny no
None but I this lip must owe
Hey nonny nonny no

Did Jove see this wanton eye
Ganymede must wait no longer
Phoebe here one night did lie
Would change her face and look much younger
But they shall not so
Hey nonny nonny no
None but I this lip must owe
Hey nonny nonny no

Thomas Middleton 15701627


THE KISS
From Cynthias Revels

O that joy so soon should waste
Or so sweet a bliss
As a kiss
Might not for ever last
So sugared so melting so soft so delicious
The dew that lies on roses
When the morn herself discloses
Is not so precious
O rather than I would it smother
Were I to taste such another
It should be my wishing
That I might die with kissing

Ben Jonson 15731637


TAKE O TAKE THOSE LIPS AWAY

Take O take those lips away
That so sweetly were forsworn
And those eyes the break of day
Lights that do mislead the morn
But my kisses bring again
Seals of love but sealed in vain

Hide O hide those hills of snow
Which thy frozen bosom bears
On whose tops the pinks that grow
Are of those that April wears
But first set my poor heart free
Bound in those icy chains by thee

The first stanza from  Measure for Measure by
William Shakespeare 15641616
The second stanza from The Bloody Brothers by
John Fletcher 15791625


A STOLEN KISS

Now gentle sleep hath closed up those eyes
Which waking kept my boldest thoughts in awe
And free access unto that sweet lip lies
From which I long the rosy breath to draw
Methinks no wrong it were if I should steal
From those two melting rubies one poor kiss
None sees the theft that would the thief reveal
Nor rob I her of aught that she can miss
Nay should I twenty kisses take away
There would be little sign I had done so
Why then should I this robbery delay
O she may wake and therewith angry grow
Well if she do Ill back restore that one
And twenty hundred thousand more for loan

George Wither 15881667


SONG

My Love bound me with a kiss
That I should no longer stay
When I felt so sweet a bliss
I had less power to part away
Alas that women do not know
Kisses make men loath to go

Yes she knows it but too well
For I heard when Venus dove
In her ear did softly tell
That kisses were the seals of love
O muse not then though it be so
Kisses make men loath to go

Wherefore did she thus inflame
My desires heat my blood
Instantly to quench the same
And starve whom she had given food
Ay ay the common sense can show
Kisses make men loath to go

Had she bid me go at first
I would neer have grieved my heart
Hope delayed had been the worst
But ah to kiss and then to part
How deep it struck speak gods you know
Kisses make men loath to go

TO ELECTRA

I dare not ask a kiss
I dare not beg a smile
Lest having that or this
I might grow proud the while

No no the utmost share
Of my desire shall be
Only to kiss that air
That lately kissed thee

Robert Herrick 15911674


COME CHLOE AND GIVE ME SWEET KISSES

Come Chloe and give me sweet kisses
For sweeter sure never girl gave
But why in the midst of my blisses
Do you ask me how many Id have
Im not to be stinted in pleasure
Then prithee my charmer be kind
For whilst I love thee above measure
To numbers Ill neer be confined

Count the bees that on Hybla are playing
Count the flowers that enamel its fields
Count the flocks that on Tempe are straying
Or the grain that rich Sicily yields
Go number the stars in the heaven
Count how many sands on the shore
When so many kisses youve given
I still shall be craving for more

To a heart full of love let me hold thee
To a heart that dear Chloe is thine
In my arms Ill for ever enfold thee
And twist round thy limbs like a vine
What joy can be greater than this is
My life on thy lips shall be spent
But the wretch that can number his kisses
With few will be ever content

Charles Hanbury Williams 17081759


A RIDDLE

I am just two and two I am warm I am cold
And the parent of numbers that cannot be told
I am lawful unlawful  a duty a fault 
I am often sold dear good for nothing when bought
An extraordinary boon and a matter of course
And yielded with pleasure when taken by force

William Cowper 17311800


TO A KISS

Soft child of love thou balmy bliss
Inform me O delicious kiss
Why thou so suddenly art gone
Lost in the moment thou art won

Yet go For wherefore should I sigh
On Delias lips with raptured eye
On Delias blushing lips I see
A thousand full as sweet as thee

John Wolcot 17381819


SONG

Often I have heard it said
That her lips are rubyred
Little heed I what they say
I have seen as red as they
Ere she smiled on other men
Real rubies were they then

When she kissed me once in play
Rubies were less bright than they
And less bright than those which shone
In the palace of the Sun
Will they be as bright again
Not if kissed by other men

Walter Savage Landor 17751864


THE FIRST KISS OF LOVE

Away with your fictions of flimsy romance
Those tissues of falsehood which folly has wove
Give me the mild beam of the soulbreathing glance
Or the rapture which dwells on the first kiss of love

Ye rhymers whose bosoms with phantasy glow
Whose pastoral passions are made for the grove
From what blest inspiration your sonnets would flow
Could you ever have tasted the first kiss of love

If Apollo should eer his assistance refuse
Or the Nine be disposed from your service to rove
Invoke them no more bid adieu to the muse
And try the effect of the first kiss of love

I hate you ye cold compositions of art
Though prudes may condemn me and bigots reprove
I court the effusions that spring from the heart
Which throbs with delight to the first kiss of love

Your shepherds your flocks those fantastical themes
Perhaps may amuse yet they never can move
Arcadia displays but a region of dreams
What are visions like these to the first kiss of love

Oh cease to affirm that man since his birth
From Adam till now has with wretchedness strove
Some portion of Paradise still is on earth
And Eden revives in the first kiss of love

When age chills the blood when our pleasures are past 
For years fleet away with the wings of the dove 
The dearest remembrance will still be the last
Our sweetest memorial the first kiss of love

George Gordon Byron 17881824


JENNY KISSED ME

Jenny kissed me when we met
Jumping from the chair she sat in
Time you thief who love to get
Sweets into your list put that in
Say Im weary say Im sad
Say that health and wealth have missed me
Say Im growing old but add
Jenny kissed me

Leigh Hunt 17841859


I FEAR THY KISSES GENTLE MAIDEN

I fear thy kisses gentle maiden
Thou needest not fear mine
My spirit is too deeply laden
Ever to burthen thine

I fear thy mien thy tones thy motion
Thou needest not fear mine
Innocent is the hearts devotion
With which I worship thine

Percy Bysshe Shelley 17921822


LOVES PHILOSOPHY

The fountains mingle with the river
And the rivers with the ocean
The winds of heaven mix forever
With a sweet emotion
Nothing in the world is single
All things by a law divine
In one anothers being mingle 
Why not I with thine

See the mountains kiss high heaven
And the waves clasp one another
No sister flower would be forgiven
If it disdained its brother
And the sunlight clasps the earth
And the moonbeams kiss the sea
What are all these kissings worth
If thou kiss not me

Percy Bysshe Shelley 17921822


SONG
From In a Gondola

The moths kiss first
Kiss me as if you made believe
You were not sure this eve
How my face your flower had pursed
Its petals up so here and there
You brush it till I grow aware
Who wants me and wide ope I burst

The bees kiss now
Kiss me as if you entered gay
My heart at some noonday
A bud that dares not disallow
The claim so all is rendered up
And passively its shattered cup
Over your head to sleep I bow

Robert Browning 18121889


SUMMUM BONUM

All the breath and the bloom of the year in the bag of one bee
All the wonder and wealth of the mine in the heart of one gem
In the core of one pearl all the shade and the shine of the sea
Breath and bloom shade and shine  wonder wealth
 and  how far above them 
Truth thats brighter than gem
Trust thats purer than pearl 
Brightest truth purest trust in the universe  all were for me
In the kiss of one girl

Robert Browning 18121889


THE FIRST KISS

If only in dreams may man be fully blest
Is heaven a dream Is she I clasped a dream
Or stood she here even now where dewdrops gleam
And miles of furze shine golden down the West
I seem to clasp her still  still on my breast
Her bosom beats  I see the blue eyes beam 
I think she kissed these lips for now they seem
Scarce mine so hallowed of the lips they pressed
Yon thickets breath  can that be eglantine
Those birds  can they be mornings choristers
Can this be earth Can these be banks of furze
Like burning bushes fired of God they shine
I seem to know them though this body of mine
Passed into spirit at the touch of hers

Theodore WattsDunton 18361914


TO MY LOVE

Kiss me softly and speak to me low
Malice has ever a vigilant ear
What if Malice were lurking near
Kiss me dear
Kiss me softly and speak to me low

Kiss me softly and speak to me low
Envy too has a watchful ear
What if Envy should chance to hear
Kiss me dear
Kiss me softly and speak to me low

Kiss me softly and speak to me low
Trust me darling the time is near
When lovers may love with never a fear
Kiss me dear
Kiss me softly and speak to me low

John Godfrey Saxe 18161887


TO LESBIA

Give me kisses Do not stay
Counting in that careful way
All the coins your lips can print
Never will exhaust the mint
Kiss me then
Every moment  and again

Give me kisses Do not stop
Measuring nectar by the drop
Though to millions they amount
They will never drain the fount
Kiss me then
Every moment  and again

Give me kisses All is waste
Save the luxury we taste
And for kissing  kisses live
Only when we take or give
Kiss me then
Every moment  and again

Give me kisses Though their worth
Far exceeds the gems of earth
Never pearls so rich and pure
Cost so little I am sure
Kiss me then
Every moment  and again

Give me kisses Nay tis true
I am just as rich as you
And for every kiss I owe
I can pay you back you know
Kiss me then
Every moment  and again

John Godfrey Saxe 18161887


MAKE BELIEVE

Kiss me though you make believe
Kiss me though I almost know
You are kissing to deceive
Let the tide one moment flow
Backward ere it rise and break
Only for poor pitys sake

Give me of your flowers one leaf
Give me of your smiles one smile
Backward roll this tide of grief
Just a moment though the while
I should feel and almost know
You are trifling with my woe

Whisper to me sweet and low
Tell me how you sit and weave
Dreams about me though I know
It is only make believe
Just a moment though tis plain
You are jesting with my pain

Alice Cary 18201871


KISSINGS NO SIN

Some say that kissings a sin
But I think its nane ava
For kissing has wonnd in this warld
Since ever that there was twa

O if it wasna lawfu
Lawyers wadna allow it
If it wasna holy
Ministers wadna do it

If it wasna modest
Maidens wadna tak it
If it wasna plenty
Puir folk wadna get it

Unknown


TO ANNE

How many kisses do I ask
Now you set me to my task
First sweet Anne will you tell me
How many waves are in the sea
How many stars are in the sky
How many lovers you make sigh
How many sands are on the shore
I shall want just one kiss more

William StirlingMaxwell 18181878


SONG

There is many a love in the land my love
But never a love like this is
Then kill me dead with your love my love
And cover me up with kisses

So kill me dead and cover me deep
Where never a soul discovers
Deep in your heart to sleep to sleep
In the darlingest tomb of lovers

Joaquin Miller 18391913


PHILLIS AND CORYDON

Phillis took a red rose from the tangles of her hair 
Time the Golden Age the place Arcadia anywhere 

Phillis laughed the saucy jade Sir Shepherd wilt have this
Or  Bashful god of skipping lambs and oaten reeds  a kiss

Bethink thee gentle Corydon A rose lasts all night long
A kiss but slips from off your lips like a thrushs evening song

A kiss that goes where no one knows A rose a crimson rose
Corydon made his choice and took  Well which do you suppose

Arthur Colton 1868







AT HER WINDOW






HARK HARK THE LARK
From Cymbeline

Hark hark the lark at heavens gate sings
And Phoebus gins arise
His steeds to water at those springs
On chaliced flowers that lies
And winking Marybuds begin
To ope their golden eyes
With everything that pretty bin
My lady sweet arise
Arise arise

William Shakespeare 15641616


SLEEP ANGRY BEAUTY

Sleep angry beauty sleep and fear not me
For who a sleeping lion dares provoke
It shall suffice me here to sit and see
Those lips shut up that never kindly spoke
What sight can more content a lovers mind
Than beauty seeming harmless if not kind

My words have charmed her for secure she sleeps
Though guilty much of wrong done to my love

And in her slumber see she closeeyed weeps
Dreams often more than waking passions move
Plead Sleep my cause and make her soft like thee
That she is peace may wake and pity me

Thomas Campion  1619


MATIN SONG

Rise Lady Mistress rise
The night hath tedious been
No sleep hath fallen into mine eyes
Nor slumbers made me sin
Is not she a saint then say
Thoughts of whom keep sin away

Rise Madam rise and give me light
Whom darkness still will cover
And ignorance darker than night
Till thou smile on thy lover
All want day till thy beauty rise
For the gray morn breaks from thine eyes

Nathaniel Field 15871633


THE NIGHTPIECE TO JULIA

Her eyes the glowworm lend thee
The shooting stars attend thee
And the elves also
Whose little eyes glow
Like the sparks of fire befriend thee

No Willothewisp mislight thee
Nor snake or slowworm bite thee
But on on thy way
Not making a stay
Since ghost theres none to affright thee

Let not the dark thee cumber
What though the moon does slumber
The stars of the night
Will lend thee their light
Like tapers clear without number

Then Julia let me woo thee
Thus thus to come unto me
And when I shall meet
Thy silvery feet
My soul Ill pour into thee


Robert Herrick 15911674


MORNING

The lark now leaves his watery nest
And climbing shakes his dewy wings
He takes your window for the east
And to implore your light he sings
Awake awake the morn will never rise
Till she can dress her beauty at your eyes

The merchant bows unto the seamans star
The ploughman from the sun his season takes
But still the lover wonders what they are
Who look for day before his mistress wakes
Awake awake break through your veils of lawn
Then draw your curtains and begin the dawn

William DAvenant 16061668


MATINSONG
From The Rape of Lucrece

Pack clouds away and welcome day
With night we banish sorrow
Sweet air blow soft mount lark aloft
To give my Love goodmorrow
Wings from the wind to please her mind
Notes from the lark Ill borrow
Bird prune thy wing nightingale sing
To give my Love goodmorrow
To give my Love goodmorrow
Notes from them both Ill borrow

Wake from thy nest Robinredbreast
Sing birds in every furrow
And from each hill let music shrill
Give my fair Love goodmorrow
Blackbird and thrush in every bush
Stare linnet and cocksparrow
You pretty elves amongst yourselves
Sing my fair Love goodmorrow
To give my Love goodmorrow
Sing birds in every furrow

Thomas Heywood  1650


THE ROSE

Sweet serene skylike flower
Haste to adorn her bower
From thy longcloudy bed
Shoot forth thy damask head

Newstartled blush of Flora
The grief of pale Aurora
Who will contest no more
Haste haste to strew her floor

Vermilion ball thats given
From lip to lip in Heaven
Loves couchs coverled
Haste haste to make her bed

Dear offspring of pleased Venus
And jolly plump Silenus
Haste haste to deck the hair
Of the only sweetly fair

See rosy is her bower
Her floor is all this flower
Her bed a rosy nest
By a bed of roses pressed

But early as she dresses
Why fly you her bright tresses
Ah I have found I fear 
Because her cheeks are near

Richard Lovelace 16181658


SONG

See see she wakes Sabina wakes
And now the sun begins to rise
Less glorious is the morn that breaks
From his bright beams than her fair eyes

With light united day they give
But different fates ere night fulfil
How many by his warmth will live
How many will her coldness kill

William Congreve 16701729


MARY MORISON

O Mary at thy window be
It is the wished the trysted hour
Those smiles and glances let me see
That make the misers treasure poor
How blithely wad I bide the stour
A weary slave frae sun to sun
Could I the rich reward secure
The lovely Mary Morison

Yestreen when to the trembling string
The dance gaed through the lighted ha
To thee my fancy took its wing
I sat but neither heard nor saw
Though this was fair and that was braw
And yon the toast of a the town
I sighed and said amang them a
Ye arena Mary Morison

O Mary canst thou wreck his peace
Wha for thy sake wad gladly die
Or canst thou break that heart of his
Whase only faut is loving thee
If love for love thou wiltna gie
At least be pity to me shown
A thought ungentle canna be
The thought o Mary Morison

Robert Burns 17591796


WAKE LADY

Up quit thy bower late wears the hour
Long have the rooks cawed round the tower
Oer flower and tree loud hums the bee
And the wild kid sports merrily
The sun is bright the sky is clear
Wake lady wake and hasten here

Up maiden fair and bind thy hair
And rouse thee in the breezy air
The lulling stream that soothed thy dream
Is dancing in the sunny beam
Waste not these hours so fresh and gay
Leave thy soft couch and haste away

Up Time will tell the morning bell
Its servicesound has chimed well
The aged crone keeps house alone
The reapers to the fields are gone
Lose not these hours so cool and gay
Lo while thou sleepst they haste away

Joanna Baillie 17621851


THE SLEEPING BEAUTY

Sleep on and dream of Heaven awhile 
Though shut so close thy laughing eyes
Thy rosy lips still wear a smile
And move and breathe delicious sighs

Ah now soft blushes tinge her cheeks
And mantle oer her neck of snow
Ah now she murmurs now she speaks
What most I wish  and fear to know

She starts she trembles and she weeps
Her fair hands folded on her breast
 And now how like a saint she sleeps
A seraph in the realms of rest

Sleep on secure Above control
Thy thoughts belong to Heaven and thee
And may the secret of thy soul
Remain within its sanctuary

Samuel Rogers 17631855


THE YOUNG MAY MOON

The young May moon is beaming love
The glowworms lamp is gleaming love
How sweet to rove
Through Mornas grove
When the drowsy world is dreaming love
Then awake  the heavens look bright my dear
Tis never too late for delight my dear
And the best of all ways
To lengthen our days
Is to steal a few hours from the night my dear

Now all the world is sleeping love
But the Sage his starwatch keeping love
And I whose star
More glorious far
Is the eye from that casement peeping love
Then awake  till rise of sun my dear
The Sages glass well shun my dear
Or in watching the flight
Of bodies of light
He might happen to take thee for one my dear

Thomas Moore 17791852


ROW GENTLY HERE

Row gently here
My gondolier
So softly wake the tide
That not an ear
On earth may hear
But hers to whom we glide
Had Heaven but tongues to speak as well
As starry eyes to see
Oh think what tales twould have to tell
Of wandering youths like me

Now rest thee here
My gondolier
Hush hush for up I go
To climb yon light
Balconys height
While thou keepst watch below
Ah did we take for Heaven above
But half such pains as we
Take day and night for womans love
What angels we should be

Thomas Moore 17791852


MORNING SERENADE

Awake the dawn is on the hills
Behold at her cool throat a rose
Blueeyed and beautiful she goes
Leaving her steps in daffodils 
Awake arise and let me see
Thine eyes whose deeps epitomize
All dawns that were or are to be
O love all Heaven in thine eyes 
Awake arise come down to me

Behold the dawn is up behold
How all the birds around her float
Wild rills of music note on note
Spilling the air with mellow gold 
Arise awake and drawing near
Let me but hear thee and rejoice
Thou who keepst captive sweet and clear
All song O love within thy voice
Arise awake and let me hear

See where she comes with limbs of day
The dawn with wildrose hands and feet
Within whose veins the sunbeams beat
And laughters meet of wind and ray
Arise come down and heart to heart
Love let me clasp in thee all these 
The sunbeam of which thou art part
And all the rapture of the breeze 
Arise come down loved that thou art

Madison Cawein 18651914


SERENADE

Softly O midnight Hours
Move softly oer the bowers
Where lies in happy sleep a girl so fair
For ye have power men say
Our hearts in sleep to sway
And cage cold fancies in a moonlight snare
Round ivory neck and arm
Enclasp a separate charm
Hang oer her poised but breathe nor sigh nor prayer
Silently ye may smile
But hold your breath the while
And let the wind sweep back your cloudy hair

Bend down your glittering urns
Ere yet the dawn returns
And star with dew the lawn her feet shall tread
Upon the air rain balm
Bid all the woods be calm
Ambrosial dreams with healthful slumbers wed
That so the Maiden may
With smiles your care repay
When from her couch she lifts her golden head
Waking with earliest birds
Ere yet the misty herds
Leave warm mid the gray grass their dusky bed

Aubrey Thomas De Vere 18141902


LINES TO AN INDIAN AIR

I arise from dreams of thee
In the first sweet sleep of night
When the winds are breathing low
And the stars are shining bright
I arise from dreams of thee
And a spirit in my feet
Has led me  who knows how
To thy chamber window sweet

The wandering airs they faint
On the dark the silent stream
The champak odors fail
Like sweet thoughts in a dream
The nightingales complaint
It dies upon her heart
As I must die on thine
O beloved as thou art

O lift me from the grass
I die I faint I fail
Let thy love in kisses rain
On my lips and eyelids pale
My cheek is cold and white alas
My heart beats loud and fast
Oh press it close to thine again
Where it must break at last

Percy Bysshe Shelley 17921822


GOODNIGHT

Goodnight ah no the hour is ill
Which severs those it should unite
Let us remain together still
Then it will be good night

How can I call the lone night good
Though thy sweet wishes wing its flight
Be it not said thought understood
Then it will be good night

To hearts which near each other move
From evening close to morning light
The night is good because my love
They never say goodnight

Percy Bysshe Shelley 17921822


SERENADE
From Sylvia

Awake thee my ladylove
Wake thee and rise
The sun through the bower peeps
Into thine eyes

Behold how the early lark
Springs from the corn
Hark hark how the flowerbird
Winds her wee horn

The swallows glad shriek is heard
All through the air
The stockdove is murmuring
Loud as she dare

Apollos winged bugleman
Cannot contain
But peals his loud trumpetcall
Once and again

Then wake thee my ladylove 
Bird of my bower
The sweetest and sleepiest
Bird at this hour

George Darley 17951846


SERENADE

Ah sweet thou little knowest how
I wake and passionate watches keep
And yet while I address thee now
Methinks thou smilest in thy sleep
Tis sweet enough to make me weep
That tender thought of love and thee
That while the world is hushed so deep
Thy souls perhaps awake to me

Sleep on sleep on sweet bride of sleep
With golden visions for thy dower
While I this midnight vigil keep
And bless thee in thy silent bower
To me tis sweeter than the power
Of sleep and fairy dreams unfurled
That I alone at this still hour
In patient love outwatch the world

Thomas Hood 17991845


SERENADE

Look out upon the stars my love
And shame them with thine eyes
On which than on the lights above
There hang more destinies
Nights beauty is the harmony
Of blending shades and light
Then lady up  look out and be
A sister to the night

Sleep not  thine image wakes for aye
Within my watching breast
Sleep not  from her soft sleep should fly
Who robs all hearts of rest
Nay lady from thy slumbers break
And make this darkness gay
With looks whose brightness well might make
Of darker nights a day

Edward Coote Pinkney 18021828


SERENADE

Hide happy damask from the stars
What sleep enfolds behind your veil
But open to the fairy cars
On which the dreams of midnight sail
And let the zephyrs rise and fall
About her in the curtained gloom
And then return to tell me all
The silken secrets of the room

Ah dearest may the elves that sway
Thy fancies come from emerald plots
Where they have dozed and dreamed all day
In hearts of blue forgetmenots
And one perhaps shall whisper thus
Awake and light the darkness Sweet
While thou art reveling with us
He watches in the lonely street

Henry Timrod 18291867


SERENADE
From The Spanish Student

Stars of the summer night
Far in yon azure deeps
Hide hide your golden light
She sleeps
My lady sleeps
Sleeps

Moon of the summer night
Far down yon western steeps
Sink sink in silver light
She sleeps
My lady sleeps
Sleeps

Wind of the summer night
Where yonder woodbine creeps
Fold fold thy pinions light
She sleeps
My lady sleeps
Sleeps

Dreams of the summer night
Tell her her lover keeps
Watch while in slumbers light
She sleeps
My lady sleeps
Sleeps

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow 18071882


COME INTO THE GARDEN MAUD
From Maud

Come into the garden Maud
For the black bat night has flown
Come into the garden Maud
I am here at the gate alone
And the woodbine spices are wafted abroad
And the musk of the rose is blown

For a breeze of morning moves
And the planet of Love is on high
Beginning to faint in the light that she loves
On a bed of daffodil sky
To faint in the light of the sun she loves
To faint in his light and to die

All night have the roses heard
The flute violin bassoon
All night has the casement jessamine stirred
To the dancers dancing in tune
Till a silence fell with the waking bird
And a hush with the setting moon

I said to the lily There is but one
With whom she has heart to be gay
When will the dancers leave her alone
She is weary of dance and play
Now half to the setting moon are gone
And half to the rising day
Low on the sand and loud on the stone
The last wheel echoes away

I said to the rose The brief night goes
In babble and revel and wine
O young lordlover what sighs are those
For one that will never be thine
But mine but mine so I sware to the rose
For ever and ever mine

And the soul of the rose went into my blood
As the music clashed in the hall
And long by the garden lake I stood
For I heard your rivulet fall
From the lake to the meadow and on to the wood
Our wood that is dearer than all

From the meadow your walks have left so sweet
That whenever a Marchwind sighs
He sets the jewelprint of your feet
In violets blue as your eyes
To the woody hollows in which we meet
And the valleys of Paradise

The slender acacia would not shake
One long milkbloom on the tree
The white lakeblossom fell into the lake
As the pimpernel dozed on the lea
But the rose was awake all night for your sake
Knowing your promise to me
The lilies and roses were all awake
They sighed for the dawn and thee

Queen rose of the rosebud garden of girls
Come hither the dances are done
In gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls
Queen lily and rose in one
Shine out little head sunning over with curls
To the flowers and be their sun

There has fallen a splendid tear
From the passionflower at the gate
She is coming my dove my dear
She is coming my life my fate
The red rose cries She is near she is near
And the white rose weeps She is late
The larkspur listens I hear I hear
And the lily whispers I wait

She is coming my own my sweet
Were it ever so airy a tread
My heart would hear her and beat
Were it earth in an earthy bed
My dust would hear her and beat
Had I lain for a century dead
Would start and tremble under her feet
And blossom in purple and red

Alfred Tennyson 18091892


AT HER WINDOW

Ah Minstrel how strange is
The carol you sing
Let Psyche who ranges
The garden of spring
Remember the changes
December will bring

Beating Heart we come again
Where my Love reposes
This is Mabels windowpane
These are Mabels roses

Is she nested Does she kneel
In the twilight stilly
Lily clad from throat to heel
She my virgin Lily

Soon the wan the wistful stars
Fading will forsake her
Elves of light on beamy bars
Whisper then and wake her

Let this friendly pebble plead
At her flowery grating
If she hear me will she heed
Mabel I am waiting

Mabel will be decked anon
Zoned in brides apparel
Happy zone Oh hark to yon
Passionshaken carol

Sing thy song thou tranced thrush
Pipe thy best thy clearest 
Hush her lattice moves oh hush 
Dearest Mabel  dearest

Frederick LockerLampson 18211895


BEDOUIN SONG

From the Desert I come to thee
On a stallion shod with fire
And the winds are left behind
In the speed of my desire
Under thy window I stand
And the midnight hears my cry
I love thee I love but thee
With a love that shall not die
Till the sun grows cold
And the stars are old
And the leaves of the Judgment
Book unfold

Look from thy window and see
My passion and my pain
I lie on the sands below
And I faint in thy disdain
Let the nightwinds touch thy brow
With the heat of my burning sigh
And melt thee to hear the vow
Of a love that shall not die
Till the sun grows cold
And the stars are old
And the leaves of the Judgment
Book unfold

My steps are nightly driven
By the fever in my breast
To hear from thy lattice breathed
The word that shall give me rest
Open the door of thy heart
And open thy chamber door
And my kisses shall teach thy lips
The love that shall fade no more
Till the sun grows cold
And the stars are old
And the leaves of the Judgment
Book unfold

Bayard Taylor 18251878


NIGHT AND LOVE
From Ernest Maltravers

When stars are in the quiet skies
Then most I pine for thee
Bend on me then thy tender eyes
As stars look on the sea

For thoughts like waves that glide by night
Are stillest when they shine
Mine earthly love lies hushed in light
Beneath the heaven of thine

There is an hour when angels keep
Familiar watch oer men
When coarser souls are wrapped in sleep 
Sweet spirit meet me then

There is an hour when holy dreams
Through slumber fairest glide
And in that mystic hour it seems
Thou shouldst be by my side

My thoughts of thee too sacred are
For daylights common beam
I can but know thee as my star
My angel and my dream

Edward George Earle Bulwer Lytton 18031873


NOCTURNE

Up to her chamber window
A slight wire trellis goes
And up this Romeos ladder
Clambers a bold white rose

I lounge in the ilex shadows
I see the lady lean
Unclasping her silken girdle
The curtains folds between

She smiles on her whiterose lover
She reaches out her hand
And helps him in at the window 
I see it where I stand

To her scarlet lip she holds him
And kisses him many a time 
Ah me it was he that won her
Because he dared to climb

Thomas Bailey Aldrich 18371907


PALABRAS CARINOSAS
Spanish Air

Goodnight I have to say goodnight
To such a host of peerless things
Goodnight unto the slender hand
All queenly with its weight of rings
Goodnight to fond uplifted eyes
Goodnight to chestnut braids of hair
Goodnight unto the perfect mouth
And all the sweetness nestled there 
The snowy hand detains me then
Ill have to say Goodnight again

But there will come a time my love
When if I read our stars aright
I shall not linger by this porch
With my farewells Till then goodnight
You wish the time were now And I
You do not blush to wish it so
You would have blushed yourself to death
To own so much a year ago 
What both these snowy hands ah then
Ill have to say Goodnight again

Thomas Bailey Aldrich 18371907


SERENADE

The western wind is blowing fair
Across the dark Aegean sea
And at the secret marble stair
My Tyrian galley waits for thee
Come down the purple sail is spread
The watchman sleeps within the town
O leave thy lilyflowered bed
O Lady mine come down come down

She will not come I know her well
Of lovers vows she hath no care
And little good a man can tell
Of one so cruel and so fair
True love is but a womans toy
They never know the lovers pain
And I who love as loves a boy
Must love in vain must love in vain

O noble pilot tell me true
Is that the sheen of golden hair
Or is it but the tangled dew
That binds the passionflowers there
Good sailor come and tell me now
Is that my Ladys lily hand
Or is it but the gleaming prow
Or is it but the silver sand

No no tis not the tangled dew
Tis not the silverfretted sand
It is my own dear Lady true
With golden hair and lily hand
O noble pilot steer for Troy
Good sailor ply the laboring oar
This is the Queen of life and joy
Whom we must bear from Grecian shore

The waning sky grows faint and blue
It wants an hour still of day
Aboard aboard my gallant crew
O Lady mine away away
O noble pilot steer for Troy
Good sailor ply the laboring oar
O loved as only loves a boy
O loved for ever evermore

Oscar Wilde 18561900


THE LITTLE RED LARK

O swan of slenderness
Dove of tenderness
Jewel of joys arise
The little red lark
Like a soaring spark
Of song to his sunburst flies
But till thou art arisen
Earth is a prison
Full of my lonesome sighs
Then awake and discover
To thy fond lover
The morn of thy matchless eyes
The dawn is dark to me
Hark oh hark to me

Pulse of my heart I pray
And out of thy hiding
With blushes gliding
Dazzle me with thy day
Ah then once more to thee
Flying Ill pour to thee
Passion so sweet and gay
The larks shall listen
And dewdrops glisten
Laughing on every spray


Alfred Perceval Graves 18461931


SERENADE

By day my timid passions stand
Like begging children at your gate
Each with a mute appealing hand
To ask a dole of Fate
But when night comes released from doubt
Like merry minstrels they appear
The stars ring out their hopeful shout
Beloved can you hear

They dare not sing to you by day
Their alldesirous song or take
The world with their adventurous lay
For your enchanted sake
But when the nightwind wakes and thrills
The shadows that the night unbars
Their music fills the dreamy hills
And folds the friendly stars

Beloved can you hear They sing
Words that no mortal lips can sound
Love through the world has taken wing
My passions are unbound
And now and now my lips my eyes
Are stricken dumb with hope and fear
It is my burning soul that cries
Beloved can you hear

Richard Middleton 18821911







THE COMEDY OF LOVE





A LOVERS LULLABY

Sing lullaby as women do
Wherewith they bring their babes to rest
And lullaby can I sing too
As womanly as can the best
With lullaby they still the child
And if I be not much beguiled
Full many a wanton babe have I
Which must be stilled with lullaby

First lullaby my youthful years
It is now time to go to bed
For crooked age and hoary hairs
Have won the haven within my head
With lullaby then youth be still
With lullaby content thy will
Since courage quails and comes behind
Go sleep and so beguile thy mind

Next lullaby my gazing eyes
Which wonted were to glance apace
For every glass may now suffice
To show the furrows in thy face
With lullaby then wink awhile
With lullaby your looks beguile
Let no fair face nor beauty bright
Entice you eft with vain delight

And lullaby my wanton will
Let reasons rule now reign thy thought
Since all too late I find by skill
How dear I have thy fancies bought
With lullaby now take thine ease
With lullaby thy doubts appease
For trust to this if thou be still
My body shall obey thy will

Thus lullaby my youth mine eyes
My will my ware and all that was
I can no more delays devise
But welcome pain let pleasure pass
With lullaby now take your leave
With lullaby your dreams deceive
And when you rise with waking eye
Remember then this lullaby

George Gascoigne 15251577


PHILLIDA AND CORIDON

In the merry month of May
In a morn by break of day
Forth I walked by the woodside
When as May was in his pride
There I spied all alone
Phillida and Coridon
Much ado there was God wot
He would love and she would not
She said Never man was true
He said None was false to you
He said He had loved her long
She said Love should have no wrong
Coridon would kiss her then
She said Maids must kiss no men
Till they did for good and all
Then she made the shepherd call
All the heavens to witness truth
Never loved a truer youth
Thus with many a pretty oath
Yea and nay and faith and troth
Such as silly shepherds use
When they will not Love abuse
Love which had been long deluded
Was with kisses sweet concluded
And Phillida with garlands gay
Was made the Lady of the May

Nicholas Breton 15451626


CRABBED AGE AND YOUTH
From The Passionate Pilgrim

Crabbed Age and Youth
Cannot live together
Youth is full of pleasance
Age is full of care
Youth like summer morn
Age like winter weather
Youth like summer brave
Age like winter bare
Youth is full of sport
Ages breath is short
Youth is nimble Age is lame
Youth is hot and bold
Age is weak and cold
Youth is wild and Age is tame
Age I do abhor thee
Youth I do adore thee
O my Love my Love is young
Age I do defy thee
O sweet shepherd hie thee
For methinks thou stayst too long

William Shakespeare 15641616


IT WAS A LOVER AND HIS LASS
From As You Like It

It was a lover and his lass
With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
That oer the green cornfield did pass
In the spring time the only pretty ring time
When birds do sing hey ding a ding ding
Sweet lovers love the spring

Between the acres of the rye
With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
These pretty country folks would lie
In the spring time the only pretty ring time
When birds do sing hey ding a ding ding
Sweet lovers love the spring

This carol they began that hour
With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
How that life was but a flower
In the spring time the only pretty ring time
When birds do sing hey ding a ding ding
Sweet lovers love the spring

And therefore take the present time
With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
For love is crowned with the prime
In the spring time the only pretty ring time
When birds do sing hey ding a ding ding
Sweet lovers love the spring

William Shakespeare 15641616


I LOVED A LASS


I loved a lass a fair one
As fair as eer was seen
She was indeed a rare one
Another Sheba Queen
But fool as then I was
I thought she loved me too
But now alas shes left me
Falero lero loo

Her hair like gold did glister
Each eye was like a star
She did surpass her sister
Which passed all others far
She would me honey call
Shed  O shed kiss me too
But now alas shes left me
Falero lero loo

Many a merry meeting
My love and I have had
She was my only sweeting
She made my heart full glad
The tears stood in her eyes
Like to the morning dew
But now alas shes left me
Falero lero loo

Her cheeks were like the cherry
Her skin was white as snow
When she was blithe and merry
She angellike did show
Her waist exceeding small
The fives did fit her shoe
But now alas shes left me
Falero lero loo

In summer time or winter
She had her hearts desire
I still did scorn to stint her
From sugar sack or fire
The world went round about
No cares we ever knew
But now alas shes left me
Falero lero loo

To maidens vows and swearing
Henceforth no credit give
You may give them the hearing
But never them believe
They are as false as fair
Unconstant frail untrue
For mine alas hath left me
Falero lero loo

George Wither 15881667


TO CHLORIS

Ah Chloris that I now could sit
As unconcerned as when
Your infant beauty could beget
No pleasure nor no pain
When I the dawn used to admire
And praised the coming day
I little thought the growing fire
Must take my rest away

Your charms in harmless childhood lay
Like metals in the mine
Age from no face took more away
Than youth concealed in thine
But as your charms insensibly
To their perfection pressed
Fond love as unperceived did fly
And in my bosom rest

My passion with your beauty grew
And Cupid at my heart
Still as his mother favored you
Threw a new flaming dart
Each gloried in their wanton part
To make a lover he
Employed the utmost of his art 
To make a beauty she

Charles Sedley 16391701


SONG

The merchant to secure his treasure
Conveys it in a borrowed name
Euphelia serves to grace my measure
But Chloe is my real flame

My softest verse my darling lyre
Upon Euphelias toilet lay
When Chloe noted her desire
That I should sing that I should play

My lyre I tune my voice I raise
But with my numbers mix my sighs
And while I sing Euphelias praise
I fix my soul on Chloes eyes

Fair Chloe blushed Euphelia frowned
I sung and gazed I played and trembled
And Venus to the Loves around
Remarked how ill we all dissembled

Matthew Prior 16641721


PIOUS SELINDA

Pious Selinda goes to prayers
If I but ask her favor
And yet the silly fools in tears
If she believes Ill leave her
Would I were free from this restraint
Or else had hopes to win her
Would she could make of me a saint
Or I of her a sinner

William Congreve 16701729


FAIR HEBE

Fair Hebe I left with a cautious design
To escape from her charms and to drown them in wine
I tried it but found when I came to depart
The wine in my head and still love in my heart

I repaired to my Reason entreated her aid
Who paused on my case and each circumstance weighed
Then gravely pronounced in return to my prayer
That Hebe was fairest of all that was fair

Thats a truth replied I Ive no need to be taught
I came for your counsel to find out a fault
If thats all quoth Reason return as you came
To find fault with Hebe would forfeit my name

What hopes then alas of relief from my pain
While like lightning she darts through each throbbing vein
My Senses surprised in her favor took arms
And Reason confirms me a slave to her charms

John West 16931766


A MAIDENS IDEAL OF A HUSBAND
From The Contrivances

Genteel in personage
Conduct and equipage
Noble by heritage
Generous and free
Brave not romantic
Learned not pedantic
Frolic not frantic
This must he be

Honor maintaining
Meanness disdaining
Still entertaining
Engaging and new
Neat but not finical
Sage but not cynical
Never tyrannical
But ever true

Henry Carey  1743


PHILLADA FLOUTS ME

O what a plague is love
How shall I bear it
She will inconstant prove
I greatly fear it
She so torments my mind
That my strength faileth
And wavers with the wind
As a ship saileth
Please her the best I may
She loves still to gainsay
Alack and welladay
Phillada flouts me

At the fair yesterday
She did pass by me
She looked another way
And would not spy me
I wooed her for to dine
But could not get her
Will had her to the wine 
He might entreat her
With Daniel she did dance
On me she looked askance
O thrice unhappy chance
Phillada flouts me

Fair maid be not so coy
Do not disdain me
I am my mothers joy
Sweet entertain me
Shell give me when she dies
All that is fitting
Her poultry and her bees
And her goose sitting
A pair of mattress beds
And a bag full of shreds
And yet for all this guedes
Phillada flouts me

She hath a clout of mine
Wrought with blue coventry
Which she keeps for a sign
Of my fidelity
But i faith if she flinch
She shall not wear it
To Tib my tother wench
I mean to bear it
And yet it grieves my heart
So soon from her to part
Death strike me with his dart
Phillada flouts me

Thou shalt eat crudded cream
All the year lasting
And drink the crystal stream
Pleasant in tasting
Whig and whey whilst thou lust
And brambleberries
Pielid and pastrycrust
Pears plums and cherries
Thy raiment shall be thin
Made of a weevils skin 
Yet alls not worth a pin
Phillada flouts me

In the last month of May
I made her posies
I heard her often say
That she loved roses
Cowslips and gillyflowers
And the white lily
I brought to deck the bowers
For my sweet Philly
But she did all disdain
And threw them back again
Therefore tis flat and plain
Phillada flouts me

Fair maiden have a care
And in time take me
I can have those as fair
If you forsake me
For Doll the dairymaid
Laughed at me lately
And wanton Winifred
Favors me greatly
One throws milk on my clothes
Tother plays with my nose
What wanting signs are those
Phillada flouts me

I cannot work nor sleep
At all in season
Love wounds my heart so deep
Without all reason
I gin to pine away
In my loves shadow
Like as a fat beast may
Penned in a meadow
I shall be dead I fear
Within this thousand year
And all for that my dear
Phillada flouts me

WHEN MOLLY SMILES

When Molly smiles beneath her cow
I feel my heart  I cant tell how
When Molly is on Sunday dressed
On Sundays I can take no rest

What can I do On worky days
I leave my work on her to gaze
What shall I say At sermons I
Forget the text when Mollys by

Good master curate teach me how
To mind your preaching and my plow
And if for this youll raise a spell
A good fat goose shall thank you well

CONTENTIONS

It was a lordlings daughter the fairest one of three
That liked of her master as well as well might be
Till looking on an Englishman the fairst that eye could see
Her fancy fell aturning

Long was the combat doubtful that love with love did fight
To leave the master loveless or kill the gallant knight
To put in practice either alas it was a spite
Unto the silly damsel

But one must be refused more mickle was the pain
That nothing could be used to turn them both to gain
For of the two the trusty knight was wounded with disdain
Alas she could not help it

Thus art with arms contending was victor of the day
Which by a gift of learning did bear the maid away
Then lullaby the learned man hath got the lady gays
For now my song is ended

Unknown


I ASKED MY FAIR ONE HAPPY DAY
After Lessing

I asked my fair one happy day
What I should call her in my lay
By what sweet name from Rome or Greece
Lalage Neaera Chloris
Sappho Lesbia or Doris
Arethusa or Lucrece

Ah replied my gentle fair
Beloved what are names but air
Choose thou whatever suits the line
Call me Sappho call me Chloris
Call me Lalage or Doris
Only  only call me thine

Samuel Taylor Coleridge 17721834


THE EXCHANGE

We pledged our hearts my love and I 
I in my arms the maiden clasping
I could not tell the reason why
But oh I trembled like an aspen

Her fathers love she bade me gain
I went and shook like any reed
I strove to act the man  in vain
We had exchanged our hearts indeed

Samuel Taylor Coleridge 17721834


COMIN THROUGH THE RYE

Comin through the rye poor body
Comin through the rye
She draiglet a her petticoatie
Comin through the rye

Oh Jennys a wat poor body
Jennys seldom dry
She draiglet a her petticoatie
Comin through the rye

Gin a body meet a body
Comin through the rye
Gin a body kiss a body
Need a body cry

Gin a body meet a body
Comin through the glen
Gin a body kiss a body
Need the warld ken

Robert Burns 17591796


GREEN GROW THE RASHES O

Theres naught but care on every han
In every hour that passes O
What signifies the life o man
An twere na for the lasses O

Green grow the rashes O
Green grow the rashes O
The sweetest hours that eer I spend
Are spent amang the lasses O

The warlly race may riches chase
An riches still may fly them O
An though at last they catch them fast
Their hearts can neer enjoy them O

Gie me a canny hour at een
My arms about my dearie O
An warlly cares an warlly men
May a gae tapsalteerie O

For you sae douce ye sneer at this
Yeer naught but senseless asses O
The wisest man the warl eer saw
He dearly loved the lasses O

Auld Nature swears the lovely dears
Her noblest work she classes O
Her prentice han she tried on man
An then she made the lasses O

Robert Burns 17591796


DEFIANCE

Catch her and hold her if you can 
See she defies you with her fan
Shuts opens and then holds it spread
In threatening guise above your head
Ah why did you not start before
She reached the porch and closed the door
Simpleton will you never learn
That girls and time will not return
Of each you should have made the most
Once gone they are forever lost
In vain your knuckles knock your brow
In vain will you remember how
Like a slim brook the gamesome maid
Sparkled and ran into the shade

Walter Savage Landor 17751864


OF CLEMENTINA

In Clementinas artless mien
Lucilla asks me what I see
And are the roses of sixteen
Enough for me

Lucilla asks if that be all
Have I not culled as sweet before
Ah yes Lucilla and their fall
I still deplore

I now behold another scene
Where Pleasure beams with Heavens own light
More pure more constant more serene
And not less bright

Faith on whose breast the Loves repose
Whose chain of flowers no force can sever
And Modesty who when she goes
Is gone for ever

Walter Savage Landor 17751864


THE TIME IVE LOST IN WOOING

The time Ive lost in wooing
In watching and pursuing
The light that lies
In womans eyes
Has been my hearts undoing
Though Wisdom oft has sought me
I scorned the lore she brought me 
My only books
Were womens looks
And follys all they taught me

Her smile when Beauty granted
I hung with gaze enchanted
Like him the sprite
Whom maids by night
Oft meet in glen thats haunted
Like him too Beauty won me
But when the spell was on me
If once their ray
Was turned away
O winds could not outrun me

And are those follies going
And is my proud heart growing
Too cold or wise
For brilliant eyes
Again to set it glowing
No  vain alas th endeavor
From bonds so sweet to sever 
Poor Wisdoms chance
Against a glance
Is now as weak as ever

Thomas Moore 17791852


DEAR FANNY

She has beauty but you must keep your heart cool
She has wit but you mustnt be caught so
Thus Reason advises but Reasons a fool
And tis not the first time I have thought so
Dear Fanny
Tis not the first time I have thought so

She is lovely then love her nor let the bliss fly
Tis the charm of youths vanishing season
Thus Love has advised me and who will deny
That Love reasons better than Reason
Dear Fanny
Love reasons much better than Reason

Thomas Moore 17791852


A CERTAIN YOUNG LADY

Theres a certain young lady
Whos just in her heyday
And full of all mischief I ween
So teasing so pleasing
Capricious delicious
And you know very well whom I mean

With an eye dark as night
Yet than noonday more bright
Was ever a black eye so keen
It can thrill with a glance
With a beam can entrance
And you know very well whom I mean

With a stately step  such as
Youd expect in a duchess 
And a brow might distinguish a queen
With a mighty proud air
That says touch me who dare
And you know very well whom I mean

With a toss of the head
That strikes one quite dead
But a smile to revive one again
That toss so appalling
That smile so enthralling
And you know very well whom I mean

Confound her deil take her 
A cruel heartbreaker 
But hold see that smile so serene
God love her God bless her
May nothing distress her
You know very well whom I mean

Heaven help the adorer
Who happens to bore her
The lover who wakens her spleen
But too blest for a sinner
Is he who shall win her
And you know very well whom I mean

Washington Irving 17831859


WHERE BE YOU GOING YOU DEVON MAID

Where be you going you Devon maid
And what have ye there in the basket
Ye tight little fairy just fresh from the dairy
Will ye give me some cream if I ask it

I love your hills and I love your dales
And I love your flocks ableating
But oh on the heather to lie together
With both our hearts abeating

Ill put your basket all safe in a nook
Your shawl Ill hang on a willow
And we will sigh in the daisys eye
And kiss on a grassgreen pillow

John Keats 17951821


LOVE IN A COTTAGE

They may talk of love in a cottage
And bowers of trellised vine 
Of nature bewitchingly simple
And milkmaids half divine
They may talk of the pleasure of sleeping
In the shade of a spreading tree
And a walk in the fields at morning
By the side of a footstep free

But give me a sly flirtation
By the light of a chandelier 
With music to play in the pauses
And nobody very near
Or a seat on a silken sofa
With a glass of pure old wine
And mamma too blind to discover
The small white hand in mine

Your love in a cottage is hungry
Your vine is a nest for flies 
Your milkmaid shocks the Graces
And simplicity talks of pies
You lie down to your shady slumber
And wake with a bug in your ear
And your damsel that walks in the morning
Is shod like a mountaineer

True love is at home on a carpet
And mightily likes his ease 
And true love has an eye for a dinner
And starves beneath shady trees
His wing is the fan of a lady
His foots an invisible thing
And his arrow is tipped with a jewel
And shot from a silver string

Nathaniel Parker Willis 18061867


SONG OF THE MILKMAID
From Queen Mary

Shame upon you Robin
Shame upon you now
Kiss me would you with my hands
Milking the cow
Daisies grow again
Kingcups blow again
And you came and kissed me milking the cow

Robin came behind me
Kissed me well I vow
Cuff him could I with my hands
Milking the cow
Swallows fly again
Cuckoos cry again
And you came and kissed me milking the cow

Come Robin Robin
Come and kiss me now
Help it can I with my hands
Milking the cow
Ringdoves coo again
All things woo again
Come behind and kiss me milking the cow

Alfred Tennyson 18091892


WOULDNT YOU LIKE TO KNOW

I know a girl with teeth of pearl
And shoulders white as snow
She lives  ah well
I must not tell 
Wouldnt you like to know

Her sunny hair is wondrous fair
And wavy in its flow
Who made it less
One little tress 
Wouldnt you like to know

Her eyes are blue celestial hue
And dazzling in their glow
On whom they beam
With melting gleam 
Wouldnt you like to know

Her lips are red and finely wed
Like roses ere they blow
What lover sips
Those dewy lips 
Wouldnt you like to know

Her fingers are like lilies fair
When lilies fairest grow
Whose hand they press
With fond caress 
Wouldnt you like to know

Her foot is small and has a fall
Like snowflakes on the snow
And where it goes
Beneath the rose 
Wouldnt you like to know

She has a name the sweetest name
That language can bestow
Twould break the spell
If I should tell 
Wouldnt you like to know

John Godfrey Saxe 18161887


SING HEIGHHO

There sits a bird on every tree
Sing heighho
There sits a bird on every tree
And courts his love as I do thee
Sing heighho and heighho
Young maids must marry

There grows a flower on every bough
Sing heighho
There grows a flower on every bough
Its petals kiss  Ill show you how
Sing heighho and heighho
Young maids must marry

From sea to stream the salmon roam
Sing heighho
From sea to stream the salmon roam
Each finds a mate and leads her home
Sing heighho and heighho
Young maids must marry

The suns a bridegroom earth a bride
Sing heighho
They court from morn till eventide
The earth shall pass but love abide
Sing heighho and heighho
Young maids must marry

Charles Kingsley 18191875


THE GOLDEN FISH

Love is a little golden fish
Wondrous shy    ah wondrous shy   
You may catch him if you wish
He might make a dainty dish   
But I   
Ah Ive other fish to fry

For when I try to snare this prize
Earnestly and patiently
All my skill the rogue defies
Lurking safe in Aimees eyes   
So you see
I am caught and Love goes free

George Arnold 18341865


THE COURTIN

God makes sech nights all white an still
Fur z you can look or listen
Moonshine an snow on field an hill
All silence an all glisten

Zekle crep up quite unbeknown
An peeked in thru the winder
An there sot Huldy all alone
ith no one nigh to hender

A fireplace filled the rooms one side
With half a cord o wood in 
There warnt no stoves tell comfort died
To bake ye to a puddin

The wanut logs shot sparkles out
Towards the pootiest bless her
An leetle flames danced all about
The chiny on the dresser

Agin the chimbley crooknecks hung
An in amongst em rusted
The ole queensarm thet granther Young
Fetched back fom Concord busted

The very room coz she was in
Seemed warm fom floor to ceilin
An she looked full ez rosy agin
Ez the apples she was peelin

Twas kin o kingdomcome to look
On sech a blessed cretur
A dogrose blushin to a brook
Aint modester nor sweeter

He was six foot o man A I
Clear grit an human natur
None couldnt quicker pitch a ton
Nor dror a furrer straighter

Hed sparked it with full twenty gals
Hed squired em danced em druv em
Fust this one an then thet by spells 
All is he couldnt love em

But long o her his veins ould run
All crinkly like curled maple
The side she breshed felt full o sun
Ez a south slope in Apil

She thought no vice hed sech a swing
Ez hisn in the choir
My when he made Ole Hundred ring
She knowed the Lord was nigher

An shed blush scarlit right in prayer
When her new meetinbunnet
Felt somehow thru its crown a pair
O blue eyes sot upun it

Thet night I tell ye she looked some
She seemed tove gut a new soul
For she felt sartinsure hed come
Down to her very shoesole

She heered a foot an knowed it tu
Araspin on the scraper 
All ways to once her feelins flew
Like sparks in burntup paper

He kin o litered on the mat
Some doubtfle o the sekle
His heart kep goin pittypat
But hern went pity Zekle

An yit she gin her cheer a jerk
Ez though she wished him furder
An on her apples kep to work
Parin away like murder

You want to see my Pa I spose
Wal    no    I come dasignin
To see my Ma Shes sprinklin cloes
Agin tomorrers inin

To say why gals acts so or so
Or dont ould be presumin
Mebby to mean yes an say no
Comes nateral to women

He stood a spell on one foot fust
Then stood a spell on tother
An on which one he felt the wust
He couldnt ha told ye nuther

Says he Id better call agin
Says she Think likely Mister
Thet last word pricked him like a pin
An    Wal he up an kissed her

When Ma bimeby upon em slips
Huldy sot pale ez ashes
All kin o smily roun the lips
An teary roun the lashes

For she was jes the quiet kind
Whose naturs never vary
Like streams that keep a summer mind
Snowhid in Jenooary

The blood clost roun her heart felt glued
Too tight for all expressin
Tell mother see how metters stood
And gin em both her blessin

Then her red come back like the tide
Down to the Bay o Fundy
An all I know is they was cried
In meetin come nex Sunday

James Russell Lowell 18191891


LEAU DORMANTE

Curled up and sitting on her feet
Within the windows deep embrasure
Is Lydia and across the street
A lad with eyes of roguish azure
Watches her buried in her book
In vain he tries to win a look
And from the trellis over there
Blows sundry kisses through the air
Which miss the mark and fall unseen
Uncared for Lydia is thirteen

My lad if you without abuse
Will take advice from one whos wiser
And put his wisdom to more use
Than ever yet did your adviser
If you will let as none will do
Anothers heartbreak serve for two
Youll have a care some four years hence
How you lounge there by yonder fence
And blow those kisses through that screen 
For Lydia will be seventeen

Thomas Bailey Aldrich 18371907


A PRIMROSE DAME

She has a primrose at her breast
I almost wish I were a Tory
I like the Radicals the best
She has a primrose at her breast
Now is it chance she so is dressed
Or must I tell a story
She has a primrose at her breast
I almost wish I were a Tory

Gleeson White 18511898


IF

Oh if the world were mine Love
Id give the world for thee
Alas there is no sign Love
Of that contingency

Were I a king  which isnt
To be considered now 
A diadem had glistened
Upon that lovely brow

Had fame with laurels crowned me 
She hasnt up to date 
Nor time nor change had found me
To love and thee ingrate

If Death threw down his gage Love
Though life is dear to me
Id die een of old age Love
To win a smile from thee

But being poor we part dear
And love sweet love must die
Thou wilt not break thy heart dear
No more I think shall I

James Jeffrey Roche 18471908


DONT

Your eyes were made for laughter
Sorrow befits them not
Would you be blithe hereafter
Avoid the lovers lot

The rose and lily blended
Possess your cheeks so fair
Care never was intended
To leave his furrows there

Your heart was not created
To fret itself away
By being unduly mated
To common human clay

But hearts were made for loving 
Confound philosophy
Forget what Ive been proving
Sweet Phyllis and love me

James Jeffrey Roche 18471908


AN IRISH LOVESONG

In the years about twenty
When kisses are plenty
The love of an Irish lass fell to my fate 
So winsome and sightly
So saucy and sprightly
The priest was a prophet that christened her Kate

Soft gray of the dawning
Bright blue of the morning
The sweet of her eye there was nothing to mate
A nose like a fairys
A cheek like a cherrys
And a smile  well her smile was like  nothing but Kate

To see her was passion
To love her the fashion
What wonder my heart was unwilling to wait
And daring to love her
I soon did discover
A Katherine masking in mischievous Kate

No Katy unruly
But Katherine truly 
Fond serious patient and even sedate
With a glow in her gladness
That banishes sadness 
Yet stay Should I credit the sunshine to Kate

Love cannot outlive it
Wealth cannot oergive it 
The saucy surrender she made at the gate
O Time be but human
Spare the girl in the woman
You gave me my Katherine  leave me my Kate

Robert Underwood Johnson 1853


GROWING OLD

Sweet sixteen is shy and cold
Calls me sir and thinks me old
Hears in an embarrassed way
All the compliments I pay

Finds my homage quite a bore
Will not smile on me and more
To her taste she finds the noise
And the chat of callow boys

Not the lines around my eye
Deepening as the years go by
Not white hairs that strew my head
Nor my less elastic tread

Cares I find nor joys I miss
Make me feel my years like this 
Sweet sixteen is shy and cold
Calls me sir and thinks me old

Walter Learned 18471915


TIMES REVENGE

When I was ten and she fifteen 
Ah me how fair I thought her
She treated with disdainful mien
The homage that I brought her
And in a patronizing way
Would of my shy advances say
Its really quite absurd you see
Hes very much too young for me

Im twenty now she twentyfive 
Well well how old shes growing
I fancy that my suit might thrive
If pressed again but owing
To great discrepancy in age
Her marked attentions dont engage
My young affections for you see
Shes really quite too old for me

Walter Learned 18471915


IN EXPLANATION

Her lips were so near
That  what else could I do
Youll be angry I fear
But her lips were so near 
Well I cant make it clear
Or explain it to you
But  her lips were so near
That  what else could I do

Walter Learned 18471915


OMNIA VINCIT

Long from the lists of love I stood aloof
My heart was steeled and I was beautyproof
Yet I unscathed in many a peril past
Lo here am I defeated at the last

My practice was in easychair reclined
Superiorwise to speak of womankind
Waving away the wornout creed of love
To join the smoke that wreathed itself above

Love I said in my wisdom Love is dead
For all his fabled triumphs  and instead
We find a calm affectionate respect
Doled forth by Intellect to Intellect

Yet when Love taking vengeance smote me sore
My Siren called me from no classic shore
It was no Girton trumpet that laid low
The walls of this Platonic Jericho

For when my peace of mind at length was stole
I thought no whit of Intellect or Soul
Nay I was cast in pitiful distress
By brown eyes wide with truth and tenderness

Alfred Cochrane 1865


A PASTORAL

Along the lane beside the mead
Where cowslipgold is in the grass
I matched the milkmaids easy speed
A tall and springing country lass
But though she had a merry plan
To shield her from my soft replies
Love played at CatchmeifyouCan
In Marys eyes

A mile or twain from Varley bridge
I plucked a dockleaf for a fan
And drove away the constant midge
And cooled her foreheads strip of tan
But though the maiden would not spare
My hand her pretty fingertips
Love played at KissmeifyouDare
On Marys lips

Since time was short and blood was bold
I drew me closer to her side
And watched her freckles change from gold
To pink beneath a blushing tide
But though she turned her face away
How much her panting heart confessed
Love played at FindmeforyouMay
In Marys breast

Norman Gale 1862


A ROSE

Twas a Jacqueminot rose
That she gave me at parting
Sweetest flower that blows
Twas a Jacqueminot rose
In the love garden close
With the swift blushes starting
Twas a Jacqueminot rose
That she gave me at parting

If she kissed it who knows 
Since I will not discover
And love is that close
If she kissed it who knows
Or if not the red rose
Perhaps then the lover
If she kissed it who knows
Since I will not discover

Yet at least with the rose
Went a kiss that Im wearing
More I will not disclose
Yet at least with the rose
Went whose kiss no one knows 
Since Im only declaring
Yet at least with the rose
Went a kiss that Im wearing

Arlo Bates 18501918


WOOED AND MARRIED AND A

The bride cam out o the byre
And oh as she dighted her cheeks
Sirs Im to be married the night
And hae neither blankets nor sheets
Hae neither blankets nor sheets
Nor scarce a coverlet too
The bride that has a thing to borrow
Has een right muckle ado
Wooed and married and a
Married and wooed and a
And was she nae very weel aff
That was wooed and married and a

Out spake the brides father
As he cam in frae the pleugh
Oh haud your tongue my dochter
And yese get gear eneugh
The stirk stands i the tether
And our braw bawsint yaud
Will carry ye hame your corn 
What wad ye be at ye jaud

Out spake the brides mither
What deil needs a this pride
I had nae a plack in my pouch
That night I was a bride
My gown was linsey woolsey
And neer a sark ava
And ye hae ribbons and buskins
Mair than ane or twa

Out spake the brides brither
As he cam in wi the kye
Poor Willie wad neer hae taen ye
Had he kent ye as weel as I
For yere baith proud and saucy
And no for a puir mans wife
Gin I canna get a better
Ise neer tak ane i my life

Out spake the brides sister
As she cam in frae the byre
O gin I were but married
Its a that I desire
But we puir folk maun live single
And do the best we can
I dinna ken what I should want
If I could get but a man

Alexander Ross 16991784


OWRE THE MUIR AMANG THE HEATHER

Comin though the craigs o Kyle
Amang the bonnie bloomin heather
There I met a bonnie lassie
Keepin a her ewes thegither

Owre the muir amang the heather
Owre the muir amang the heather
There I met a bonnie lassie
Keepin a her ewes thegither

Says I My dear where is thy hame 
In muir or dale pray tell me whether
She says I tent the fleecy flocks
That feed amang the bloomin heather

We laid us down upon a bank
Sae warm and sunny was the weather
She left her flocks at large to rove
Amang the bonnie bloomin heather

While thus we lay she sung a sang
Till echo rang a mile and farther
And aye the burden of the sang
Was Owre the muir amang the heather

She charmed my heart and aye sinsyne
I couldna think on ony ither
By sea and sky she shall be mine
The bonnie lass amang the heather

THE WOMEN FOLK

O sairly may I rue the day
I fancied first the womenkind
For aye sinsyne I neer can hae
Ae quiet thought or peace o mind
They hae plagued my heart an pleased my ee
An teased an flattered me at will
But aye for a their witchery
The pawky things I loe them still
O the women folk O the women folk
But they hae been the wreck o me
O weary fa the women folk
For they winna let a body be

I hae thought an thought but darena tell
Ive studied them wi a my skill
Ive loed them better than mysel
Ive tried again to like them ill
Wha sairest strives will sairest rue
To comprehend what nae man can
When he has done what man can do
Hell end at last where he began
That they hae gentle forms an meet
A man wi half a look may see
An gracefu airs an faces sweet
An waving curls aboon the bree
An smiles as saft as the young rosebud
An een sae pawky bright an rare
Wad lure the laverock frae the clud 
But laddie seek to ken nae mair

James Hogg 17701835


LOVE IS LIKE A DIZZINESS

I lately lived in quiet ease
An never wished to marry O
But when I saw my Peggys face
I felt a sad quandary O
Though wild as ony Athol deer
She has trepanned me fairly O
Her cherry cheeks an een sae clear
Torment me late an early O
O love love love
Love is like a dizziness
It winna let a poor body
Gang about his biziness

To tell my feats this single week
Wad mak a daftlike diary O
I drave my cart out owre a dike
My horses in a miry O
I wear my stockings white an blue
My loves sae fierce an fiery O
I drill the land that I should pleugh
An pleugh the drills entirely O

Ae morning by the dawn o day
I rase to theek the stable O
I cuist my coat an plied away
As fast as I was able O
I wrought that morning out an out
As Id been redding fire O
When I had done an looked about
Gudefaith it was the byre O

Her wily glance Ill neer forget
The dear the lovely blinkin ot
Has pierced me through an through the heart
An plagues me wi the prinkling ot
I tried to sing I tried to pray
I tried to drown t wi drinkin ot
I tried wi sport to drive t away
But neer can sleep for thinkin ot

Nae man can tell what pains I prove
Or how severe my pliskie O
I swear Im sairer drunk wi love
Than ever I was wi whiskey O
For love has raked me fore an aft
I scarce can lift a leggie O
I first grew dizzy then gaed daft
An soon Ill dee for Peggy O

James Hogg 17701835


BEHAVE YOURSEL BEFORE FOLK

Behave yoursel before folk
Behave yoursel before folk
And dinna be sae rude to me
As kiss me sae before folk

It wadna gie me meikle pain
Gin we were seen and heard by nane
To tak a kiss or grant you ane
But guidsake no before folk
Behave yoursel before folk
Behave yoursel before folk
Whateer ye do when out o view
Be cautious aye before folk

Consider lad how folk will crack
And what a great affair theyll mak
O naething but a simple smack
Thats gien or taen before folk
Behave yoursel before folk
Behave yoursel before folk
Nor gie the tongue o auld or young
Occasion to come oer folk

Its no through hatred o a kiss
That I sae plainly tell you this
But losh I tak it sair amiss
To be sae teased before folk
Behave yoursel before folk
Behave yoursel before folk
When were our lane ye may tak ane
But fient a ane before folk

Im sure wi you Ive been as free
As ony modest lass should be
But yet it doesna do to see
Sic freedom used before folk
Behave yoursel before folk
Behave yoursel before folk
Ill neer submit again to it 
So mind you that  before folk

Ye tell me that my face is fair
It may be sae  I dinna care 
But neer again gart blush sae sair
As ye hae done before folk
Behave yoursel before folk
Behave yoursel before folk
Nor heat my cheeks wi your mad freaks
But aye be douce before folk

Ye tell me that my lips are sweet
Sic tales I doubt are a deceit
At ony rate its hardly meet
To pree their sweets before folk
Behave yoursel before folk
Behave yoursel before folk
Gin thats the case theres time and place
But surely no before folk

But gin you really do insist
That I should suffer to be kissed
Gae get a license frae the priest
And mak me yours before folk
Behave yoursel before folk
Behave yoursel before folk
And when were ane baith flesh and bane
Ye may tak ten  before folk

Alexander Rodger 17841846


RORY OMORE OR GOOD OMENS

Young Rory OMore courted Kathleen bawn
He was bold as a hawk  she as soft as the dawn
He wished in his heart pretty Kathleen to please
And he thought the best way to do that was to tease
Now Rory be aisy sweet Kathleen would cry
Reproof on her lip but a smile in her eye
With your tricks I dont know in troth what Im about
Faith youve teased till Ive put on my cloak inside out
Och jewel says Rory that same is the way
Youve thrated my heart for this many a day
And tis plazed that I am and why not to be sure
For tis all for good luck says bold Rory OMore

Indeed then says Kathleen dont think of the like
For I half gave a promise to soothering Mike
The ground that I walk on he loves Ill be bound
Faith says Rory Id rather love you than the ground
Now Rory Ill cry if you dont let me go
Sure I drame evry night that Im hating you so
Oh says Rory that same Im delighted to hear
For drames always go by conthrairies my dear
So jewel keep draming that same till you die
And bright mornin will give dirty night the black lie
And tis plazed that I am and why not to be sure
Since tis all for good luck says bold Rory OMore

Arrah Kathleen my darlint youve teased me enough
Sure Ive thrashed for your sake Dinny Grimes and Jim Duff
And Ive made myself drinkin your health quite a baste
So I think after that I may talk to the praste
Then Rory the rogue stole his arm round her neck
So soft and so white without freckle or speck
And he looked in her eyes that were beaming with light
And he kissed her sweet lips  dont you think he was right
Now Rory leave off sir youll hug me no more
Thats eight times today that youve kissed me before
Then here goes another says he to make sure
For theres luck in odd numbers says Rory OMore

Samuel Lover 17971868


ASK AND HAVE

Oh tis time I should talk to your mother
Sweet Mary says I
Oh dont talk to my mother says Mary
Beginning to cry
For my mother says men are deceivers
And never I know will consent
She says girls in a hurry to marry
At leisure repent

Then suppose I would talk to your father
Sweet Mary says I
Oh dont talk to my father says Mary
Beginning to cry
For my father he loves me so dearly
Hell never consent I should go 
If you talk to my father says Mary
Hell surely say No

Then how shall I get you my jewel
Sweet Mary says I
If your father and mothers so cruel
Most surely Ill die
Oh never say die dear says Mary
A way now to save you I see
Since my parents are both so contrary 
Youd better ask me

Samuel Lover 17971868


KITTY OF COLERAINE

As beautiful Kitty one morning was tripping
With a pitcher of milk from the fair of Coleraine
When she saw me she stumbled the pitcher down tumbled
And all the sweet buttermilk watered the plain

Oh what shall I do now  twas looking at you now
Sure sure such a pitcher Ill neer meet again
Twas the pride of my dairy Oh Barney MacCleary
Youre sent as a plague to the girls of Coleraine

I sat down beside her and gently did chide her
That such a misfortune should give her such pain
A kiss then I gave her and ere I did leave her
She vowed for such pleasure shed break it again

Twas haymaking season  I cant tell the reason 
Misfortunes will never come single tis plain
For very soon after poor Kittys disaster
The devil a pitcher was whole in Coleraine

Charles Dawson Shanly 18111875


THE PLAIDIE

Upon ane stormy Sunday
Coming adoon the lane
Were a score of bonnie lassies 
And the sweetest I maintain
Was Caddie
That I took unneath my plaidie
To shield her from the rain

She said the daisies blushed
For the kiss that I had taen
I wadna hae thought the lassie
Wad sae of a kiss complain
Now laddie
I winna stay under your plaidie
If I gang hame in the rain

But on an after Sunday
When cloud there was not ane
This selfsame winsome lassie
We chanced to meet in the lane
Said Laddie
Why dinna ye wear your plaidie
Wha kens but it may rain

Charles Sibley   


KITTY NEIL

Ah sweet Kitty Neil rise up from that wheel
Your neat little foot will be weary from spinning
Come trip down with me to the sycamoretree
Half the parish is there and the dance is beginning
The sun is gone down but the full harvestmoon
Shines sweetly and cool on the dewwhitened valley
While all the air rings with the soft loving things
Each little bird sings in the green shaded alley

With a blush and a smile Kitty rose up the while
Her eye in the glass as she bound her hair glancing
Tis hard to refuse when a young lover sues
So she couldnt but choose to go off to the dancing
And now on the green the glad groups are seen
Each gayhearted lad with the lass of his choosing
And Pat without fail leads out sweet Kitty Neil 
Somehow when he asked she neer thought of refusing

Now Felix Magee puts his pipes to his knee
And with flourish so free sets each couple in motion
With a cheer and a bound the lads patter the ground
The maids move around just like swans on the ocean
Cheeks bright as the rose  feet light as the does
Now coyly retiring now boldly advancing 
Search the world all around from the sky to the ground
No such sight can be found as an Irish lass dancing

Sweet Kate who could view your bright eyes of deep blue
Beaming humidly through their dark lashes so mildly
Your fairturned arm heaving breast rounded form
Nor feel his heart warm and his pulses throb wildly
Young Pat feels his heart as he gazes depart
Subdued by the smart of such painful yet sweet love
The sight leaves his eye as he cries with a sigh
Dance light for my heart it lies under your feet love

John Francis Waller 18101894

THE OULD PLAID SHAWL

Not far from old Kinvara in the merry month of May
When birds were singing cheerily there came across my way
As if from out the sky above an angel chanced to fall
A little Irish cailin in an ould plaid shawl

She tripped along right joyously a basket on her arm
And oh her face and oh her grace the soul of saint would charm
Her brown hair rippled oer her brow but greatest charm of all
Was her modest blue eyes beaming neath her ould plaid shawl

I courteously saluted her  God save you miss says I
God save you kindly sir said she and shyly passed me by
Off went my heart along with her a captive in her thrall
Imprisoned in the corner of her ould plaid shawl

Enchanted with her beauty rare I gazed in pure delight
Till round an angle of the road she vanished from my sight
But ever since I sighing say as I that scene recall
The grace of God about you and your ould plaid shawl

Ive heard of highway robbers that with pistols and with knives
Make trembling travelers yield them up their money or their lives
But think of me that handed out my heart and head and all
To a simple little cailin in an ould plaid shawl

Oh graceful the mantillas that the signorinas wear
And tasteful are the bonnets of Parisian ladies fair
But never cloak or hood or robe in palace bower or hall
Clad half such witching beauty as that ould plaid shawl

Oh some men sigh for riches and some men live for fame
And some on historys pages hope to win a glorious name
My aims are not ambitious and my wishes are but small 
You might wrap them all together in an ould plaid shawl

Ill seek her all through Galway and Ill seek her all through Clare
Ill search for tale or tidings of my traveler everywhere
For peace of mind Ill never find until my own I call
That little Irish cailin in her ould plaid shawl

Francis A Fahy 1854


LITTLE MARY CASSIDY

Oh tis little Mary Cassidys the cause of all my misery
And the raison that I am not now the boy I used to be
Oh she bates the beauties all that we read about in history
And sure half the countryside is as hot for her as me
Travel Ireland up and down hill village vale and town 
Fairer than the Cailin Donn youre looking for in vain
Oh Id rather live in poverty with little Mary Cassidy
Than emperor without her be of Germany or Spain

Twas at the dance at Darmodys that first I caught a sight of her
And heard her sing the Droighnean Donn till tears came in my eyes
And ever since that blessed hour Im dreaming day and night of her
The devil a wink of sleep at all I get from bed to rise
Cheeks like the rose in June song like the lark in tune
Working resting night or noon she never leaves my mind
Oh till singing by my cabin fire sits little Mary Cassidy
Tis little aise or happiness Im sure Ill ever find

What is wealth what is fame what is all that people fight about
To a kind word from her lips or a loveglance from her eye
Oh though troubles throng my breast sure theyd soon go to the rightabout
If I thought the curly head of her would rest there by and by
Take all I own today kith kin and care away
Ship them all across the say or to the frozen zone
Lave me an orphan bare  but lave me Mary Cassidy
I never would feel lonesome with the two of us alone

Francis A Fahy 1854


THE ROAD

Now where are ye goin ses I wid the shawl
An cotton umbrella an basket an all
Would ye not wait for McMullens machine
Wid that iligant instep befittin a queen
Oh you wid the windsoft gray eye wid a wile in it
You wid the lip wid the troublesome smile in it
Sure the roads wet ivery rainmuddied mile in it 
Ah the Saintsll be kapin me petticoats clean

But ses I would ye like it to meet Clancys bull
Or the tinks poachin rabbits above Slievenacoul
An the ford at Kilmaddy is big wid the snows
An the whisht Little People that wear the green close
Theyd run from the bog to be makin a catch o ye
The king o thems wishful o weddin the match o ye
Twould be long if they did ere ye lifted the latch o ye 
What fairys to touch her that sings as she goes

Ah where are ye goin ses I wid the shawl
An the gray eyes adreamin beneath it an all
The road by the mountains a long one depend
Yell be done for alannah ere reachin the end
Yell be bate wid the wind on each backbreakin bit on it
Wet wid the puddles and lamed wid the grit on it 
Since lonesome yere layin yer delicut fit on it 
Sure whins a road lonesome thats stepped wid a friend

Thats stepped wid a friend
Who did Bridgy intend
Still twas me that went wid her right on to the end

TWICKENHAM FERRY

Ahoy and Oho and its whos for the ferry
The briars in bud and the sun going down
And Ill row ye so quick and Ill row ye so steady
And tis but a penny to Twickenham Town
The ferrymans slim and the ferrymans young
With just a soft tang in the turn of his tongue
And hes fresh as a pippin and brown as a berry
And tis but a penny to Twickenham Town

Ahoy and Oho and its Im for the ferry
The briars in bud and the sun going down
And its late as it is and I havent a penny 
Oh how can I get me to Twickenham Town
Shed a rose in her bonnet and oh she looked sweet
As the little pink flower that grows in the wheat
With her cheeks like a rose and her lips like a cherry 
Its sure but youre welcome to Twickenham Town

Ahoy and Oho Youre too late for the ferry
The briars in bud and the sun has gone down
And hes not rowing quick and hes not rowing steady
It seems quite a journey to Twickenham Town
Ahoy and Oho you may call as you will
The young moon is rising oer Petersham Hill
And with Love like a rose in the stern of the wherry
Theres danger in crossing to Twickenham Town

Theophile Marzials 1850







THE HUMOR OF LOVE






SONG

I prithee send me back my heart
Since I cannot have thine
For if from yours you will not part
Why then shouldst thou have mine

Yet now I think ont let it lie
To find it were in vain
For thou hast a thief in either eye
Would steal it back again

Why should two hearts in one breast lie
And yet not lodge together
O love where is thy sympathy
If thus our breasts thou sever

But love is such a mystery
I cannot find it out
For when I think Im best resolved
I then am most in doubt

Then farewell care and farewell woe
I will no longer pine
For Ill believe I have her heart
As much as she hath mine

John Suckling 16091642


A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING

I tell thee Dick where I have been
Where I the rarest things have seen
Oh things without compare
Such sights again cannot be found
In any place on English ground
Be it at wake or fair

At Charing Cross hard by the way
Where we thou knowst do sell our hay
There is a house with stairs
And there did I see coming down
Such folk as are not in our town
Forty at least in pairs

Amongst the rest one pestlent fine
His beard no bigger though than thine
Walked on before the rest
Our landlord looks like nothing to him
The king God bless him twould undo him
Should he go still so drest

At Courseapark without all doubt
He should have first been taken out
By all the maids i th town
Though lusty Roger there had been
Or little George upon the green
Or Vincent of the Crown

But wot you what The youth was going
To make an end of all his wooing
The parson for him staid
Yet by his leave for all his haste
He did not so much wish all past
Perchance as did the maid

The maid and thereby hangs a tale
For such a maid no Whitsunale
Could ever yet produce
No grape thats kindly ripe could be
So round so plump so soft as she
Nor half so full of juice

Her finger was so small the ring
Would not stay on which they did bring
It was too wide a peck
And to say truth for out it must
It looked like the great collar just
About our young colts neck

Her feet beneath her petticoat
Like little mice stole in and out
As if they feared the light
But oh she dances such a way
No sun upon an Easterday
Is half so fine a sight

Her cheeks so rare a white was on
No daisy makes comparison
Who sees them is undone
For streaks of red were mingled there
Such as are on a Cathrine pear
The side thats next the sun

Her lips were red and one was thin
Compared to that was next her chin
Some bee had stung it newly
But Dick her eyes so guard her face
I durst no more upon them gaze
Than on the sun in July

Her mouth so small when she does speak
Thoudst swear her teeth her words did break
That they might passage get
But she so handled still the matter
They came as good as ours or better
And are not spent a whit

Passion o me how I run on
Theres that that would be thought upon
I trow besides the bride
The business of the kitchens great
For it is fit that men should eat
Nor was it there denied

Just in the nick the cook knocked thrice
And all the waiters in a trice
His summons did obey
Each servingman with dish in hand
Marched boldly up like our trainedband
Presented and away

When all the meat was on the table
What man of knife or teeth was able
To stay to be intreated
And this the very reason was
Before the parson could say grace
The company was seated

Now hats fly off and youths carouse
Healths first go round and then the house
The brides come thick and thick
And when twas named anothers health
Perhaps he made it hers by stealth
And who could help it Dick

O th sudden up they rise and dance
Then sit again and sigh and glance
Then dance again and kiss
Thus sevral ways the time did pass
Till evry woman wished her place
And evry man wished his

By this time all were stoln aside
To counsel and undress the bride
But that he must not know
But yet twas thought he guessed her mind
And did not mean to stay behind
Above an hour or so

John Suckling 16091642


TO CHLOE JEALOUS

Dear Chloe how blubbered is that pretty face
Thy cheek all on fire and thy hair all uncurled
Prithee quit this caprice and as old Falstaff says
Let us een talk a little like folks of this world

How canst thou presume thou hast leave to destroy
The beauties which Venus but lent to thy keeping
Those looks were designed to inspire love and joy
More ordinary eyes may serve people for weeping

To be vexed at a trifle or two that I writ
Your judgment at once and my passion you wrong
You take that for fact which will scarce be found wit
Ods life must one swear to the truth of a song

What I speak my fair Chloe and what I write shows
The difference there is betwixt nature and art
I court others in verse but I love thee in prose
And they have my whimsies but thou hast my heart

The god of us versemen you know Child the sun
How after his journeys he sets up his rest
If at morning oer earth tis his fancy to run
At night he reclines on his Thetiss breast

So when I am wearied with wandering all day
To thee my delight in the evening I come
No matter what beauties I saw in my way
They were but my visits but thou art my home

Then finish dear Chloe this pastoral war
And let us like Horace and Lydia agree
For thou art a girl as much brighter than her
As he was a poet sublimer than me

Matthew Prior 16641721


JACK AND JOAN

Jack and Joan they think no ill
But loving live and merry still
Do their weekdays work and pray
Devoutly on the holy day
Skip and trip it on the green
And help to choose the Summer Queen
Lash out at a country feast
Their silver penny with the best

Well can they judge of nappy ale
And tell at large a winter tale
Climb up to the apple loft
And turn the crabs till they be soft
Tib is all the fathers joy
And little Tom the mothers boy
All their pleasure is content
And care to pay their yearly rent

Joan can call by name her cows
And deck her windows with green boughs
She can wreaths and tuttyes make
And trim with plums a bridal cake
Jack knows what brings gain or loss
And his long flail can stoutly toss
Makes the hedge which others break
And ever thinks what he doth speak

Now you courtly dames and knights
That study only strange delights
Though you scorn the homespun gray
And revel in your rich array
Though your tongues dissemble deep
And can your heads from danger keep
Yet for all your pomp and train
Securer lives the silly swain

Thomas Campion   1619


PHILLIS AND CORYDON

Phillis kept sheep along the western plains
And Corydon did feed his flocks hard by
This shepherd was the flower of all the swains
That traced the downs of fruitful Thessaly
And Phillis that did far her flocks surpass
In silver hue was thought a bonny lass

A bonny lass quaint in her country tire
Was lovely Phillis  Corydon swore so
Her locks her looks did set the swain on fire
He left his lambs and he began to woo
He looked he sighed he courted with a kiss
No better could the silly swad than this

He little knew to paint a tale of love
Shepherds can fancy but they cannot say
Phillis gan smile and wily thought to prove
What uncouth grief poor Corydon did pay
She asked him how his flocks or he did fare
Yet pensive thus his sighs did tell his care

The shepherd blushed when Phillis questioned so
And swore by Pan it was not for his flocks
Tis love fair Phillis breedeth all this woe
My thoughts are trapped within thy lovely locks
Thine eye hath pierced thy face hath set on fire
Fair Phillis kindleth Corydons desire

Can shepherds love said Phillis to the swain
Such saints as Phillis Corydon replied
Men when they lust can many fancies feign
Said Phillis This not Corydon denied
That lust had lies But love quoth he says truth
Thy shepherd loves then Phillis what ensuth

Phillis was won she blushed and hung her head
The swain stepped to and cheered her with a kiss
With faith with troth they struck the matter dead
So used they when men thought not amiss
Thus love begun and ended both in one
Phillis was loved and she liked Corydon

Robert Greene 15601592


SALLY IN OUR ALLEY

Of all the girls that are so smart
Theres none like pretty Sally
She is the darling of my heart
And she lives in our alley
There is no lady in the land
Is half so sweet as Sally
She is the darling of my heart
And she lives in our alley

Her father he makes cabbagenets
And through the streets does cry em
Her mother she sells laces long
To such as please to buy em
But sure such folks could neer beget
So sweet a girl as Sally
She is the darling of my heart
And she lives in our alley

When she is by I leave my work
I love her so sincerely
My master comes like any Turk
And bangs me most severely
But let him bang his bellyful
Ill bear it all for Sally
She is the darling of my heart
And she lives in our alley

Of all the days thats in the week
I dearly love but one day 
And thats the day that comes betwixt
A Saturday and Monday
For then Im dressed all in my best
To walk abroad with Sally
She is the darling of my heart
And she lives in our alley

My master carries me to church
And often am I blamed
Because I leave him in the lurch
As soon as text is named
I leave the church in sermontime
And slink away to Sally
She is the darling of my heart
And she lives in our alley

When Christmas comes about again
O then I shall have money
Ill hoard it up and box it all
Ill give it to my honey
I would it were ten thousand pound
Id give it all to Sally
She is the darling of my heart
And she lives in our alley

My master and the neighbors all
Make game of me and Sally
And but for her Id better be
A slave and row a galley
But when my seven long years are out
O then Ill marry Sally
O then well wed and then well bed 
But not in our alley

Henry Carey  1743


THE COUNTRY WEDDING

Well met pretty nymph says a jolly young swain
To a lovely young shepherdess crossing the plain
Why so much in haste  now the month it was May 
May I venture to ask you fair maiden which way
Then straight to this question the nymph did reply
With a blush on her cheek and a smile in her eye
I came from the village and homeward I go
And now gentle shepherd pray why would you know

I hope pretty maid you wont take it amiss
If I tell you my reason for asking you this
I would see you safe home  now the swain was in love
Of such a companion if you would approve
Your offer kind shepherd is civil I own
But I see no great danger in going alone
Nor yet can I hinder the road being free
For one as another for you as for me

No danger in going alone it is true
But yet a companion is pleasanter too
And if you could like  now the swain he took heart 
Such a sweetheart as me why we never would part
O thats a long word said the shepherdess then
Ive often heard say theres no minding you men
Youll say and unsay and youll flatter tis true
Then to leave a young maidens the first thing you do

O judge not so harshly the shepherd replied
To prove what I say I will make you my bride
Tomorrow the parson  wellsaid little swain 
Shall join both our hands and make one of us twain
Then what the nymph answered to this isnt said
The very next morn to be sure they were wed
Sing heydiddle  hodiddle  heydiddledown 
Now when shall we see such a wedding in town

O MERRY MAY THE MAID BE

O merry may the maid be
That marries wi the miller
For foul day and fair day
Hes aye bringing till her 
Has aye a penny in his purse
For dinner or for supper
And gin she please a good fat cheese
And lumps of yellow butter

When Jamie first did woo me
I speired what was his calling
Fair maid says he O come and see
Yere welcome to my dwalling
Though I was shy yet could I spy
The truth o what he told me
And that his house was warm and couth
And room in it to hold me

Behind the door a bag o meal
And in the kist was plenty
O guid hard cakes his mither bakes
And bannocks werena scanty
A guid fat sow a sleeky cow
Was standing in the byre
Whilst lazy puss with mealy mouse
Was playing at the fire

Guid signs are these my mither says
And bids me tak the miller
For fair day and foul day
Hes aye bringing till her
For meal and maut she doesna want
Nor anything thats dainty
And now and then a kecking hen
To lay her eggs in plenty

In winter when the wind and rain
Blaws oer the house and byre
He sits beside a clean hearthstane
Before a rousing fire
With nutbrown ale he tells his tale
Which rows him oer fu nappy 
Whad be a king  a petty thing
When a miller lives so happy

John Clerk 16841755


THE LASS O GOWRIE

Twas on a simmers afternoon
A wee afore the sun gaed doun
A lassie wi a braw new goun
Cam owre the hills to Gowrie
The rosebud washed in simmers shower
Bloomed fresh within the sunny bower
But Kitty was the fairest flower
That eer was seen in Gowrie

To see her cousin she cam there
And oh the scene was passing fair
For what in Scotland can compare
Wi the Carse o Gowrie
The sun was setting on the Tay
The blue hills melting into gray
The mavis and the blackbirds lay
Were sweetly heard in Gowrie

O lang the lassie I had wooed
And truth and constancy had vowed
But could nae speed wi her I loed
Until she saw fair Gowrie
I pointed to my faithers ha 
Yon bonnie bield ayont the shaw
Sae loun that there nae blast could blaw 
Wad she no bide in Gowrie

Her faither was baith glad and wae
Her mither she wad naething say
The bairnies thocht they wad get play
If Kitty gaed to Gowrie
She whiles did smile she whiles did greet

The blush and tear were on her cheek
She naething said and hung her head 
But now shes Leddy Gowrie

THE CONSTANT SWAIN AND VIRTUOUS MAID

Soon as the day begins to waste
Straight to the wellknown door I haste
And rapping there Im forced to stay
While Molly hides her work with care
Adjusts her tucker and her hair
And nimble Becky scours away

Entering I see in Mollys eyes
A sudden smiling joy arise
As quickly checked by virgin shame
She drops a curtsey steals a glance
Receives a kiss one step advance 
If such I love am I to blame

I sit and talk of twenty things
Of South Sea stock or death of kings
While only Yes or No says Molly
As cautious she conceals her thoughts
As others do their private faults 
Is this her prudence or her folly

Parting I kiss her lip and cheek
I hang about her snowy neck
And cry Farewell my dearest Molly
Yet still I hang and still I kiss
Ye learned sages say is this
In me the effect of love or folly

No  both by sober reason move 
She prudence shows and I true love 
No charge of folly can be laid
Then till the marriagerites proclaimed
Shall join our hands let us be named
The constant swain the virtuous maid

WHEN THE KYE COMES HAME

Come all ye jolly shepherds
That whistle through the glen
Ill tell ye of a secret
That courtiers dinna ken
What is the greatest bliss
That the tongue o man can name
Tis to woo a bonnie lassie
When the kye comes hame
When the kye comes hame
When the kye comes hame
Tween the gloamin and the mirk
When the kye comes hame

Tis not beneath the coronet
Nor canopy of state
Tis not on couch of velvet
Nor arbor of the great 
Tis beneath the spreading birk
In the glen without the name
Wi a bonnie bonnie lassie
When the kye comes hame

There the blackbird bigs his nest
For the mate he loes to see
And on the topmost bough
O a happy bird is he
Then he pours his melting ditty
And love is a the theme
And hell woo his bonnie lassie
When the kye comes hame

When the blewart bears a pearl
And the daisy turns a pea
And the bonnie lucken gowan
Has fauldit up her ee
Then the laverock frae the blue lift
Draps down and thinks nae shame
To woo his bonnie lassie
When the kye comes hame

See yonder pawkie shepherd
That lingers on the hill 
His ewes are in the fauld
And his lambs are lying still
Yet he downa gang to bed
For his heart is in a flame
To meet his bonnie lassie
When the kye comes hame

When the little wee bit heart
Rises high in the breast
And the little wee bit starn
Rises red in the east
O theres a joy sae dear
That the heart can hardly frame
Wi a bonnie bonnie lassie
When the kye comes hame

Then since all nature joins
In this love without alloy
O wha wad prove a traitor
To Natures dearest joy
Or wha wad choose a crown
Wi its perils and its fame
And miss his bonnie lassie
When the kye comes hame
When the kye comes hame
When the kye comes hame
Tween the gloamin and the mirk
When the kye comes hame

James Hogg 17701835


THE LOWBACKED CAR

When first I saw sweet Peggy
Twas on a market day
A lowbacked car she drove and sat
Upon a truss of hay
But when that hay was blooming grass
And decked with flowers of Spring
No flower was there that could compare
With the blooming girl I sing
As she sat in the lowbacked car
The man at the turnpike bar
Never asked for the toll
But just rubbed his ould poll
And looked after the lowbacked car

In battles wild commotion
The proud and mighty Mars
With hostile scythes demands his tithes
Of death  in warlike cars
While Peggy peaceful goddess
Has darts in her bright eye
That knock men down in the market town
As right and left they fly 
While she sits in her lowbacked car
Than battle more dangerous far 
For the doctors art
Cannot cure the heart
That is hit from that lowbacked car

Sweet Peggy round her car sir
Has strings of ducks and geese
But the scores of hearts she slaughters
By far outnumber these
While she among her poultry sits
Just like a turtledove
Well worth the cage I do engage
Of the blooming god of Love
While she sits in her lowbacked car
The lovers come near and far
And envy the chicken
That Peggy is pickin
As she sits in her lowbacked car

O Id rather own that car sir
With Peggy by my side
Than a coachandfour and goold galore
And a lady for my bride
For the lady would sit forninst me
On a cushion made with taste
While Peggy would sit beside me
With my arm around her waist 
While we drove in the lowbacked car
To be married by Father Mahar
O my heart would beat high
At her glance and her sigh 
Though it beat in a lowbacked car

Samuel Lover 17971868


THE PRETTY GIRL OF LOCH DAN

The shades of eve had crossed the glen
That frowns oer infant Avonmore
When nigh Loch Dan two weary men
We stopped before a cottage door

God save all here my comrade cries
And rattles on the raised latchpin
God save you kindly quick replies
A clear sweet voice and asks us in

We enter from the wheel she starts
A rosy girl with soil black eyes
Her fluttering curtsey takes our hearts
Her blushing grace and pleased surprise

Poor Mary she was quite alone
For all the way to Glenmalure
Her mother had that morning gone
And left the house in charge with her

But neither household cares nor yet
The shame that startled virgins feel
Could make the generous girl forget
Her wonted hospitable zeal

She brought us in a beechen bowl
Sweet milk that smacked of mountain thyme
Oat cake and such a yellow roll
Of butter  it gilds all my rhyme

And while we ate the grateful food
With weary limbs on bench reclined
Considerate and discreet she stood
Apart and listened to the wind

Kind wishes both our souls engaged
From breast to breast spontaneous ran
The mutual thought  we stood and pledged
The modest rose above Loch Dan

The milk we drink is not more pure
Sweet Mary  bless those budding charms 
Than your own generous heart Im sure
Nor whiter than the breast it warms

She turned and gazed unused to hear
Such language in that homely glen
But Mary you have naught to fear
Though smiled on by two strangermen

Not for a crown would I alarm
Your virgin pride by word or sign
Nor need a painful blush disarm
My friend of thoughts as pure as mine

Her simple heart could not but feel
The words we spoke were free from guile
She stooped she blushed she fixed her wheel 
Tis all in vain  she cant but smile

Just like sweet Aprils dawn appears
Her modest face  I see it yet 
And though I lived a hundred years
Methinks I never could forget

The pleasure that despite her heart
Fills all her downcast eyes with light
The lips reluctantly apart
The white teeth struggling into sight

The dimples eddying oer her cheek 
The rosy cheek that wont be still 
O who could blame what flatterers speak
Did smiles like this reward their skill

For such another smile I vow
Though loudly beats the midnight rain
Id take the mountainside een now
And walk to Luggelaw again

Samuel Ferguson 18101886


MUCKLEMOUTH MEG

Frowned the Laird on the Lord So redhanded I catch thee
Deathdoomed by our Law of the Border
Weve a gallows outside and a chiel to dispatch thee
Who trespasses  hangs alls in order

He met frown with smile did the young English gallant
Then the Lairds dame Nay Husband I beg
Hes comely be merciful Grace for the callant
 If he marries our Mucklemouth Meg

No milewidemouthed monster of yours do I marry
Grant rather the gallows laughed he
Foul fare kith and kin of you  why do you tarry
To tame your fierce temper quoth she

Shove him quick in the Hole shut him fast for a week
Cold darkness and hunger work wonders
Who lionlike roars now mousefashion will squeak
And it rains soon succeed to it thunders

A week did he bide in the cold and dark
 Not hunger for duly at morning
In flitted a lass and a voice like a lark
Chirped Mucklemouth Meg still yere scorning

Go hang but heres parritch to hearten ye first
Did Megs mucklemouth boast within some
Such music as yours mine should match it or burst
No frogjaws So tell folk my Winsome

Soon week came to end and from Holes door set wide
Out he marched and there waited the lassie
Yon gallows or Mucklemouth Meg for a bride
Consider Skys blue and turfs grassy

Lifes sweet shall I say ye wed Mucklemouth Meg
Not I quoth the stout heart too eerie
The mouth that can swallow a bubblyjocks egg
Shall I let it munch mine Never Dearie

Not Mucklemouth Meg Wow the obstinate man
Perhaps he would rather wed me
Ay would he  with just for a dowry your can
Im Mucklemouth Meg chirruped she

Then so  so  so  so  as he kissed her apace 
Will I widen thee out till thou turnest
From Margaret Minnikinmou by Gods grace
To Mucklemouth Meg in good earnest

Robert Browning 18121889

Neer saddle nor munt again harness nor dunt again
Wat neer shall hunt again neer see his hame

Syne mucklemoud Meg pressed in close to his side
An blinkit fu sleely and kind
But aye as Wat glowered at his braw proffered bride
He shook like a leaf in the wind
A bride or a gallows a rope or a wife
The morning dawned sunny and clear 
Wat boldly strode forward to part wi his life
Till he saw Meggy shedding a tear
Then saddle an munt again harness an dunt again
Fain wad Wat hunt again fain wad be hame

Megs tear touched his bosom the gibbet frowned high
An slowly Wat strode to his doom
He gae a glance round wi a tear in his eye
Meg shone like a star through the gloom
She rushed to his arms they were wed on the spot
An loed ither muckle and lang
Nae bauld border laird had a wife like Wat Scott
Twas better to marry than hang
So saddle an munt again harness an dunt again
Elibank hunt again Wats snug at hame

LOCHINVAR
From Marmion

O young Lochinvar is come out of the west
Through all the wide Border his steed was the best
And save his good broadsword he weapon had none
He rode all unarmed and he rode all alone
So faithful in love and so dauntless in war
There never was knight like the young Lochinvar

He stayed not for brake and he stopped not for stone
He swam the Eske river where ford there was none
But ere he alighted at Netherby gate
The bride had consented the gallant came late
For a laggard in love and a dastard in war
Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar

So boldly he entered the Netherby Hall
Among bridesmen and kinsmen and brothers and all
Then spoke the brides father his hand on his sword
For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word
O come ye in peace here or come ye in war
Or to dance at our bridal young Lord Lochinvar

I long wooed your daughter my suit you denied 
Love swells like the Solway but ebbs like its tide 
And now am I come with this lost love of mine
To lead but one measure drink one cup of wine
There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far
That would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar

The bride kissed the goblet the knight took it up
He quaffed off the wine and he threw down the cup
She looked down to blush and she looked up to sigh
With a smile on her lips and a tear in her eye
He took her soft hand era her mother could bar 
Now tread we a measure said young Lochinvar

So stately his form and so lovely her face
That never a hall such a galliard did grace
While her mother did fret and her father did fume
And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume
And the bridemaidens whispered Twere better by far
To have matched our fair cousin with young Lochinvar

One touch to her hand and one word in her ear
When they reached the halldoor and the charger stood near
So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung
So light to the saddle before her he sprung
She is won we are gone over bank bush and scaur
Theyll have fleet steeds that follow quoth young Lochinvar

There was mounting mong Graemes of the Netherby clan
Forsters Fenwicks and Musgraves they rode and they ran
There was racing and chasing on Cannobie Lee
But the lost bride of Netherby neer did they see
So daring in love and so dauntless in war
Have ye eer heard of gallant like young Lochinvar

JOCK OF HAZELDEAN

Why weep ye by the tide ladie
Why weep ye by the tide
Ill wed ye to my youngest son
And ye sall be his bride
And ye sall be his bride ladie
Sae comely to be seen 
But aye she loot the tears down fa
For Jock of Hazeldean

Now let this wilfu grief be done
And dry that cheek so pale
Young Frank is chief of Errington
And lord of Langleydale
His step is first in peaceful ha
His sword in battle keen 
But aye she loot the tears down fa
For Jock of Hazeldean

A chain of gold ye sall not lack
Nor braid to bind your hair
Nor mettled hound nor managed hawk
Nor palfrey fresh and fair
And you the foremost o them a
Shall ride our forestqueen 
But aye she loot the tears down fa
For Jock of Hazeldean

The kirk was decked at morningtide
The tapers glimmered fair
The priest and bridegroom wait the bride
And dame and knight are there
They sought her baith by bower and ha
The ladie was not seen
Shes oer the Border and awa
Wi Jock of Hazeldean

CANDOR
October  A Wood

I know what youre going to say she said
And she stood up looking uncommonly tall
You are going to speak of the hectic fall
And say youre sorry the summers dead
And no other summer was like it you know
And can I imagine what made it so
Now arent you honestly Yes I said

I know what youre going to say she said
You are going to ask if I forget
That day in June when the woods were wet
And you carried me  here she drooped her head 
Over the creek you are going to say
Do I remember that horrid day
Now arent you honestly Yes I said

I know what youre going to say she said
You are going to say that since that time
You have rather tended to run to rhyme
And  her clear glance fell and her cheek grew red 
And have I noticed your tone was queer
Why everybody has seen it here
Now arent you honestly Yes I said

I know what youre going to say I said
Youre going to say youve been much annoyed
And Im short of tact  you will say devoid 
And Im clumsy and awkward and call me Ted
And I bear abuse like a dear old lamb
And youll have me anyway just as I am
Now arent you honestly Yees she said

Do you remember when you heard
My lips breathe loves first faltering word
You do sweet  dont you
When having wandered all the day
Linked arm in arm I dared to say
Youll love me  wont you

And when you blushed and could not speak
I fondly kissed your glowing cheek
Did that affront you
Oh surely not  your eye expressed
No wrath  but said perhaps in jest
Youll love me  wont you

Im sure my eyes replied I will
And you believe that promise still
You do sweet  dont you
Yes yes when age has made our eyes
Unfit for questions or replies
Youll love me  wont you

Thomas Haynes Bayly 17971839


BECAUSE

Sweet Nea  for your lovely sake
I weave these rambling numbers
Because Ive lain an hour awake
And cant compose my slumbers
Because your beautys gentle light
Is round my pillow beaming
And flings I know not why tonight
Some witchery oer my dreaming

Because weve passed some joyous days
And danced some merry dances
Because we love old Beaumonts plays
And old Froissarts romances
Because wheneer I hear your words
Some pleasant feeling lingers
Because I think your heart has cords
That vibrate to your fingers

Because youve got those long soft curls
Ive sworn should deck my goddess
Because youre not like other girls
All bustle blush and bodice
Because your eyes are deep and blue
Your fingers long and rosy
Because a little child and you
Would make ones home so cosy

Because your little tiny nose
Turns up so pert and funny
Because I know you choose your beaux
More for their mirth than money
Because I think youd rather twirl
A waltz with me to guide you
Than talk small nonsense with an earl
And a coronet beside you

Because you dont object to walk
And are not given to fainting
Because you have not learned to talk
Of flowers and Poonahpainting
Because I think youd scarce refuse
To sew one on a button
Because I know you sometimes choose
To dine on simple mutton

Because I think Im just so weak
As some of those fine morrows
To ask you if youll let me speak
My story  and my sorrows
Because the rests a simple thing
A matter quickly over
A church  a priest  a sigh  a ring 
And a chaiseandfour to Dover

Edward Fitzgerald 18091883


LOVE AND AGE
From Gryll Grange

I played with you mid cowslips blowing
When I was six and you were four
When garlands weaving flowerballs throwing
Were pleasures soon to please no more
Through groves and meads oer grass and heather
With little playmates to and fro
We wandered hand in hand together
But that was sixty years ago

You grew a lovely roseate maiden
And still our early love was strong
Still with no care our days were laden
They glided joyously along
And I did love you very dearly 
How dearly words want power to show
I thought your heart was touched as nearly
But that was fifty years ago

Then other lovers came around you
Your beauty grew from year to year
And many a splendid circle found you
The center of its glittering sphere
I saw you then first vows forsaking
On rank and wealth your hand bestow
O then I thought my heart was breaking 
But that was forty years ago

And I lived on to wed another
No cause she gave me to repine
And when I heard you were a mother
I did not wish the children mine
My own young flock in fair progression
Made up a pleasant Christmas row
My joy in them was past expression 
But that was thirty years ago

You grew a matron plump and comely
You dwelt in fashions brightest blaze
My earthly lot was far more homely
But I too had my festal days
No merrier eyes have ever glistened
Around the hearthstones wintry glow
Than when my youngest child was christened 
But that was twenty years ago

Time passed My eldest girl was married
And I am now a grandsire gray
One pet of four years old Ive carried
Among the wildflowered meads to play
In our old fields of childish pleasure
Where now as then the cowslips blow
She fills her baskets ample measure 
And that is not ten years ago

But though first loves impassioned blindness
Has passed away in colder light
I still have thought of you with kindness
And shall do till our last goodnight
The everrolling silent hours
Will bring a time we shall not know
When our young days of gathering flowers
Will be an hundred years ago

Thomas Love Peacock 17851866


TO HELEN

If wandering in a wizards car
Through yon blue ether I were able
To fashion of a little star
A taper for my Helens table 
What then she asks me with a laugh 
Why then with all heavens luster glowing
It would not gild her path with half
The light her love oer mine is throwing

Winthrop Mackworth Praed 18021839


AT THE CHURCH GATE
From Pendennis

Although I enter not
Yet round about the spot
Ofttimes I hover
And near the sacred gate
With longing eyes I wait
Expectant of her

The Minster bell tolls out
Above the citys rout
And noise and humming
Theyve hushed the Minster bell
The organ gins to swell
Shes coming shes coming

My lady comes at last
Timid and stepping fast
And hastening hither
With modest eyes downcast
She comes  shes here  shes past
May heaven go with her

Kneel undisturbed fair Saint
Pour out your praise or plaint
Meekly and duly
I will not enter there
To sully your pure prayer
With thoughts unruly

But suffer me to pace
Round the forbidden place
Lingering a minute
Like outcast spirits who wait
And see through heavens gate
Angels within it

William Makepeace Thackeray 18111863


MABEL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

Fairest of the fairest rival of the rose
That is Mabel of the Hills as everybody knows

Do you ask me near what stream this sweet floweret grows
Thats an ignorant question sir as everybody knows

Ask you what her age is reckoned as time goes
Just the age of beauty as everybody knows

Is she tall as Rosalind standing on her toes
She is just the perfect height as everybody knows

Whats the color of her eyes when they ope or close
Just the color they should be as everybody knows

Is she lovelier dancing or resting in repose
Both are radiant pictures as everybody knows

Do her ships go sailing on every wind that blows
She is richer far than that as everybody knows

Has she scores of lovers heaps of bleeding beaux
That questions quite superfluous as everybody knows

I could tell you something if I only chose 
But whats the use of telling what everybody knows

James Thomas Fields 18161881


TOUJOURS AMOUR

Prithee tell me DimpleChin
At what age does Love begin
Your blue eyes have scarcely seen
Summers three my fairy queen
But a miracle of sweets
Soft approaches sly retreats
Show the little archer there
Hidden in your pretty hair
When didst learn a heart to win
Prithee tell me DimpleChin

Oh the rosy lips reply
I cant tell you if I try
Tis so long I cant remember
Ask some younger lass than I

Tell O tell me GrizzledFace
Do your heart and head keep pace
When does hoary Love expire
When do frosts put out the fire
Can its embers burn below
All that chill December snow
Care you still soft hands to press
Bonny heads to smooth and bless
When does Love give up the chase
Tell O tell me GrizzledFace

Ah the wise old lips reply
Youth may pass and strength may die
But of Love I cant foretoken
Ask some older sage than I

Edmund Clarence Stedman 18331908


THE DOORSTEP

The conferencemeeting through at last
We boys around the vestry waited
To see the girls come tripping past
Like snowbirds willing to be mated

Not braver he that leaps the wall
By level musketflashes bitten
Than I that stepped before them all
Who longed to see me get the mitten

But no she blushed and took my arm
We let the old folks have the highway
And started toward the Maple Farm
Along a kind of lovers byway

I cant remember what we said 
Twas nothing worth a song or story
Yet that rude path by which we sped
Seemed all transformed and in a glory

The snow was crisp beneath our feet
The moon was full the fields were gleaming
By hood and tippet sheltered sweet
Her face with youth and health was beaming

The little hand outside her muff
O sculptor if you could but mold it
So lightly touched my jacketcuff
To keep it warm I had to hold it

To have her with me there alone 
Twas love and fear and triumph blended
At last we reached the footworn stone
Where that delicious journey ended

The old folks too were almost home
Her dimpled hand the latches fingered
We heard the voices nearer come
Yet on the doorstep still we lingered

She shook her ringlets from her hood
And with a Thank you Ned dissembled
But yet I knew she understood
With what a daring wish I trembled

A cloud passed kindly overhead
The moon was slyly peeping through it
Yet hid its face as if it said 
Come now or never do it do it

My lips till then had only known
The kiss of mother and of sister 
But somehow full upon her own
Sweet rosy darling mouth  I kissed her

Perhaps twas boyish love yet still
O listless woman weary lover
To feel once more that fresh wild thrill
Id give  but who can live youth over

Edmund Clarence Stedman 18331908


THE WHITE FLAG

I sent my love two roses  one
As white as driven snow
And one a blushing royal red
A flaming Jacqueminot

I meant to touch and test my fate
That night I should divine
The moment I should see my love
If her true heart were mine

For if she holds me dear I said
Shell wear my blushing rose
If not shell wear my cold Lamarque
As white as winters snows

My heart sank when I met her sure
I had been overbold
For on her breast my pale rose lay
In virgin whiteness cold

Yet with low words she greeted me
With smiles divinely tender
Upon her cheek the red rose dawned 
The white rose meant surrender

John Hay 18381905


A SONG OF THE FOUR SEASONS

When Spring comes laughing
By vale and hill
By windflower walking
And daffodil 
Sing stars of morning
Sing morning skies
Sing blue of speedwell 
And my Loves eyes

When comes the Summer
Fullleaved and strong
And gay birds gossip
The orchard long 
Sing hid sweet honey
That no bee sips
Sing red red roses 
And my Loves lips

When Autumn scatters
The leaves again
And piled sheaves bury
The broadwheeled wain 
Sing flutes of harvest
Where men rejoice
Sing rounds of reapers 
And my Loves voice

But when comes Winter
With hail and storm
And red fire roaring
And ingle warm 
Sing first sad going
Of friends that part
Then sing glad meeting 
And my Loves heart

Austin Dobson 18401921


THE LOVEKNOT

Tying her bonnet under her chin
She tied her raven ringlets in
But not alone in the silken snare
Did she catch her lovely floating hair
For tying her bonnet under her chin
She tied a young mans heart within

They were strolling together up the hill
Where the wind came blowing merry and chill
And it blew the curls a frolicsome race
All over the happy peachcolored face
Till scolding and laughing she tied them in
Under her beautiful dimpled chin

And it blew a color bright as the bloom
Of the pinkest fuchsias tossing plume
All over the cheeks of the prettiest girl
That ever imprisoned a romping curl
Or in tying her bonnet under her chin
Tied a young mans heart within

Steeper and steeper grew the hill
Madder merrier chillier still
The western wind blew down and played
The wildest tricks with the little maid
As tying her bonnet under her chin
She tied a young mans heart within

O western wind do you think it was fair
To play such tricks with her floating hair
To gladly gleefully do your best
To blow her against the young mans breast
Where he as gladly folded her in
And kissed her mouth and her dimpled chin

Ah Ellery Vane you little thought
An hour ago when you besought
This country lass to walk with you
After the sun had dried the dew
What terrible danger youd be in
As she tied her bonnet under her chin

Nora Perry 18321896


RIDING DOWN

Oh did you see him riding down
And riding down while all the town
Came out to see came out to see
And all the bells rang mad with glee

Oh did you hear those bells ring out
The bells ring out the people shout
And did you hear that cheer on cheer
That over all the bells rang clear

And did you see the waving flags
The fluttering flags the tattered flags
Red white and blue shot through and through
Baptized with battles deadly dew

And did you hear the drums gay beat
The drums gay beat the bugles sweet
The cymbals clash the cannons crash
That rent the sky with sound and flash

And did you see me waiting there
Just waiting there and watching there
One little lass amid the mass
That pressed to see the hero pass

And did you see him smiling down
And smiling down as riding down
With slowest pace with stately grace
He caught the vision of a face 

My face uplifted red and white
Turned red and white with sheer delight
To meet the eyes the smiling eyes
Outflashing in their swift surprise

Oh did you see how swift it came
How swift it came like sudden flame
That smile to me to only me
The little lass who blushed to see

And at the windows all along
Oh all along a lovely throng
Of faces fair beyond compare
Beamed out upon him riding there

Each face was like a radiant gem
A sparkling gem and yet for them
No swift smile came like sudden flame
No arrowy glance took certain aim

He turned away from all their grace
From all that grace of perfect face
He turned to me to only me
The little lass who blushed to see

Nora Perry 18321896


FORGETTIN

The night when last I saw my lad
His eyes were bright an wet
He took my two hands in his own
Tis well says he were met
Asthore machree the likes o me
I bid ye now forget

Ah sure the sames a thriflin thing
Tis more Id do for him
I mind the night I promised well
Away on Ballindim 
An every little while or so
I thry forgettin Jim

It shouldnt take that long to do
An him not very tall
Tis quare the way Ill hear his voice
A boy thats out o call 
An whiles Ill see him stand as plain
As eer a sixfut wall

Och never fear my jewel
Id forget ye now this minute
If I only had a notion
O the way I should begin it
But first an last it isnt known
The heap o throubles in it

Meself began the night ye went
An hasnt done it yet
Im nearly fit to give it up
For wheres the use to fret 
An the memorys fairly spoilt on me
Wid mindin to forget

Moira ONeill 18


ACROSS THE FIELDS TO ANNE

How often in the summertide
His graver business set aside
Has stripling Will the thoughtfuleyed
As to the pipe of Pan
Stepped blithesomely with lovers pride
Across the fields to Anne

It must have been a merry mile
This summer stroll by hedge and stile
With sweet foreknowledge all the while
How sure the pathway ran
To dear delights of kiss and smile
Across the fields to Anne

The silly sheep that graze today
I wot they let him go his way
Nor once looked up as who would say
It is a seemly man
For many lads went wooing aye
Across the fields to Anne

The oaks they have a wiser look
Mayhap they whispered to the brook
The world by him shall yet be shook
It is in natures plan
Though now he fleets like any rook
Across the fields to Anne

And I am sure that on some hour
Coquetting soft twixt sun and shower
He stooped and broke a daisyflower
With heart of tiny span
And bore it as a lovers dower
Across the fields to Anne

While from her cottage gardenbed
She plucked a jasmins goodlihede
To scent his jerkins brown instead
Now since that love began
What luckier swain than he who sped
Across the fields to Anne

The winding path whereon I pace
The hedgerows green the summers grace
Are still before me face to face
Methinks I almost can
Turn port and join the singing race
Across the fields to Anne

Richard Burton 1861


PAMELA IN TOWN

The fair Pamela came to town
To London town in early summer
And up and down and round about
The beaux discussed the bright newcomer
With Gadzooks sir and Maam my duty
And Odds my life but tis a Beauty

To Ranelagh went Mistress Pam
Sweet Mistress Pam so fair and merry
With cheeks of cream and roses blent
With voice of lark and lip of cherry
Then all the beaux vowed twas their duty
To win and wear this country Beauty

And first Frank Lovelace tried his wit
With whispers bold and eyes still bolder
The warmer grew his saucy flame
Cold grew the charming fair and colder
Twas icy bosom  cruel beauty 
To love sweet Mistress tis a duty

Then Jack Carew his arts essayed
With honeyed sighs and feigned weeping
Good lack his billets bound the curls
That pretty Pam she wore asleeping
Next day these curls had richer beauty
So well Jacks fervor did its duty

Then Cousin Will came up to view
The way Pamela ruled the fashion
He watched the gallants crowd about
And flew into a rustic passion 
Left Squire his mark on divers faces
And pinked Carew beneath his laces

Alack one night at Ranelagh
The pretty Slyboots fell ablushing
And all the mettled bloods looked round
To see what caused that telltale flushing
Up stepped a grizzled Poet Fellow
To dance with Pam a saltarello

Then Jack and Frank and Will resolved
With hand on sword and cutting glances
That they would lead that Graybeard forth
To livelier tunes and other dances
But who that saw Pams eyes ashining
With love and joy would see her pining

And  oons Their wrath cooled as they looked 
That Poet stared as fierce as any
He was a mighty proper man
With blade on hip and inches many
The beaux all vowed it was their duty
To toast some newer softer Beauty

Sweet Pam she bridled blushed and smiled 
The wild thing loved and could but show it
Mayhap some day youll see in town
Pamela and her grizzled Poet
Forsooth he taught the rogue her duty
And won her faith her love her beauty

Ellen Mackay Hutchinson Cortissoz 1933


YES

Is it true then my girl that you mean it 
The word spoken yesterday night
Does that hour seem so sweet now between it
And this has come days sober light
Have you woke from a moment of rapture
To remember regret and repent
And to hate perchance him who has trapped your
Unthinking consent

Who was he last evening  this fellow
Whose audacity lent him a charm
Have you promised to wed Pulchinello
For life taking Figaros arm
Will you have the Court fool of the papers
The clown in the journalists ring
Who earns his scant bread by his capers
To be your hearts king

When we met quite by chance at the theatre
And I saw you home under the moon
Id no thought love that mischief would be at her
Tricks with my tongue quite so soon
That I should forget fate and fortune
Make a difference twixt Sevres and delf 
That Id have the calm nerve to importune
You sweet for yourself

Its appalling by Jove the audacious
Effrontery of that request
But you  you grew suddenly gracious
And hid your sweet face on my breast
Why you did it I cannot conjecture
I surprised you poor child I dare say
Or perhaps  does the moonlight affect your
Head often that way

          

Youre released With some wooer replace me
More worthy to be your lifes light
From the tablet of memory efface me
If you dont mean your Yes of last night
But  unless you are anxious to see me a
Wreck of the pipe and the cup
In my birthplace and graveyard Bohemia 
Love dont give me up

Henry Cuyler Bunner 18551896


THE PRIME OF LIFE

Just as I thought I was growing old
Ready to sit in my easy chair
To watch the world with a heart grown cold
And smile at a folly I would not share

Rose came by with a smile for me
And I am thinking that forty year
Isnt the age that it seems to be
When two pretty brown eyes are near

Bless me of life it is just the prime
A fact that I hope she will understand
And forty year is a perfect rhyme
To dark brown eyes and a pretty hand

These gray hairs are by chance you see 
Boys are sometimes gray I am told
Rose came by with a smile for me
Just as I thought I was getting old

Walter Learned 18471915


THOUGHTS ON THE COMMANDMENTS

Love your neighbor as yourself 
So the parson preaches
Thats one half the Decalogue 
So the prayerbook teaches
Half my duty I can do
With but little labor
For with all my heart and soul
I do love my neighbor

Mighty little credit that
To my selfdenial
Not to love her though might be
Something of a trial
Why the rosy light that peeps
Through the glass above her
Lingers round her lips  you see
Een the sunbeams love her

So to make my merit more
Ill go beyond the letter 
Love my neighbor as myself
Yes and ten times better
For shes sweeter than the breath
Of the Spring that passes
Through the fragrant budding woods
Oer the meadowgrasses

And Ive preached the word I know
For it was my duty
To convert the stubborn heart
Of the little beauty
Once again success has crowned
Missionary labor
For her sweet eyes own that she
Also loves her neighbor

George Augustus Baker 18491906







THE IRONY OF LOVE






SIGH NO MORE LADIES
From Much Ado About Nothing

Sigh no more ladies sigh no more
Men were deceivers ever
One foot in sea and one on shore
To one thing constant never
Then sigh not so
But let them go
And be you blithe and bonny
Converting all your sounds of woe
Into Hey nonny nonny

Sing no more ditties sing no moe
Of dumps so dull and heavy
The fraud of men was ever so
Since summer first was leavy
Then sigh not so
But let them go
And be you blithe and bonny
Converting all your sounds of woe
Into Hey nonny nonny

William Shakespeare 15641616


A RENUNCIATION

If women could be fair and yet not fond
Or that their love were firm not fickle still
I would not marvel that they make men bond
By service long to purchase their good will
But when I see how frail those creatures are
I muse that men forget themselves so far

To mark the choice they make and how they change
How oft from Phoebus they do flee to Pan
Unsettled still like haggards wild they range
These gentle birds that fly from man to man
Who would not scorn and shake them from the fist
And let them fly fair fools which way they list

Yet for disport we fawn and flatter both
To pass the time when nothing else can please
And train them to our lure with subtle oath
Till weary of their wiles ourselves we ease
And then we say when we their fancy try
To play with fools O what a fool was I

Edward Vere 15501604


A SONG

Ye happy swains whose hearts are free
From Loves imperial chain
Take warning and be taught by me
To avoid the enchanting pain
Fatal the wolves to trembling flocks
Fierce winds to blossoms prove
To careless seamen hidden rocks
To human quiet love

Fly the fair sex if bliss you prize
The snakes beneath the flower
Who ever gazed on beauteous eyes
That tasted quiet more
How faithless is the lovers joy
How constant is their care
The kind with falsehood to destroy
The cruel with despair

George Etherege 16351691


TO HIS FORSAKEN MISTRESS

I do confess thourt smooth and fair
And I might have gone near to love thee
Had I not found the slightest prayer
That lips could speak had power to move thee
But I can let thee now alone
As worthy to be loved by none

I do confess thourt sweet yet find
Thee such an unthrift of thy sweets
Thy favors are but like the wind
That kisseth everything it meets
And since thou canst with more than one
Thourt worthy to be kissed by none

The morning rose that untouched stands
Armed with her briers how sweet her smell
But plucked and strained through ruder hands
Her sweets no longer with her dwell
But scent and beauty both are gone
And leaves fall from her one by one

Such fate ere long will thee betide
When thou hast handled been awhile
With sere flowers to be thrown aside
And I shall sigh while some will smile
To see thy love to every one
Hath brought thee to be loved by none

Robert Ayton 15701638


TO AN INCONSTANT

I loved thee once Ill love no more 
Thine be the grief as is the blame
Thou art not what thou wast before
What reason I should be the same
He that can love unloved again
Hath better store of love than brain
God send me love my debts to pay
While unthrifts fool their love away

Nothing could have my love oerthrown
If thou hadst still continued mine
Yea if thou hadst remained thy own
I might perchance have yet been thine
But thou thy freedom didst recall
That it thou might elsewhere enthrall
And then how could I but disdain
A captives captive to remain

When new desires had conquered thee
And changed the object of thy will
It had been lethargy in me
Not constancy to love thee still
Yea it had been a sin to go
And prostitute affection so
Since we are taught no prayers to say
To such as must to others pray

Yet do thou glory in thy choice 
Thy choice of his good fortune boast
Ill neither grieve nor yet rejoice
To see him gain what I have lost
The height of my disdain shall be
To laugh at him to blush for thee
To love thee still but go no more
Abegging at a beggars door

Robert Ayton 15701638


ADVICE TO A GIRL

Never love unless you can
Bear with all the faults of man
Men sometimes will jealous be
Though but little cause they see
And hang the head as discontent
And speak what straight they will repent

Men that but one Saint adore
Make a show of love to more
Beauty must be scorned in none
Though but truly served in one
For what is courtship but disguise
True hearts may have dissembling eyes

Men when their affairs require
Must awhile themselves retire
Sometimes hunt and sometimes hawk
And not ever sit and talk 
If these and suchlike you can bear
Then like and love and never fear

Thomas Campion  1619


SONG
That Women Are But Mens Shadows
From The Forest

Follow a shadow it still flies you
Seem to fly it it will pursue
So court a mistress she denies you
Let her alone she will court you
Say are not women truly then
Styled but the shadows of us men

At morn and even shades are longest
At noon they are or short or none
So men at weakest they are strongest
But grant us perfect theyre not known
Say are not women truly then
Styled but the shadows of us men

Ben Johnson 15731637


TRUE BEAUTY

May I find a woman fair
And her mind as clear as air
If her beauty go alone
Tis to me as if twere none

May I find a woman rich
And not of too high a pitch
If that pride should cause disdain
Tell me Lover wheres thy gain

May I find a woman wise
And her falsehood not disguise
Hath she wit as she hath will
Doublearmed she is to ill

May I find a woman kind
And not wavering like the wind
How should I call that love mine
When tis his and his and thine

May I find a woman true
There is beautys fairest hue
There is beauty love and wit
Happy he can compass it

Francis Beaumont 15841616


THE INDIFFERENT

Never more will I protest
To love a woman but in jest
For as they cannot be true
So to give each man his due
When the wooing fit is past
Their affection cannot last

Therefore if I chance to meet
With a mistress fair and sweet
She my service shall obtain
Loving her for love again
Thus much liberty I crave
Not to be a constant slave

But when we have tried each other
If she better like another
Let her quickly change for me
Then to change am I as free
He or she that loves too long
Sell their freedom for a song

Francis Beaumont 15841616


THE LOVERS RESOLUTION

Shall I wasting in despair
Die because a womans fair
Or make pale my cheeks with care
Cause anothers rosy are
Be she fairer than the day
Or the flowery meads in May
If she think not well of me
What care I how fair she be

Shall my silly heart be pined
Cause I see a woman kind
Or a well disposed nature
Joined with a lovely feature
Be she meeker kinder than
Turtledove or pelican
If she be not so to me
What care I how kind she be

Shall a womans virtues move
Me to perish for her love
Or her welldeservings known
Make me quite forget my own
Be she with that goodness blest
Which may merit name of Best
If she be not such to me
What care I how good she be

Cause her fortune seems too high
Shall I play the fool and die
She that bears a noble mind
If not outward helps she find
Thinks what with them he would do
That without them dares her woo
And unless that mind I see
What care I how great she be

Great or good or kind or fair
I will neer the more despair
If she love me this believe
I will die ere she shall grieve
If she slight me when I woo
I can scorn and let her go
For if she be not for me
What care I for whom she be

George Wither 15881667


HIS FURTHER RESOLUTION

Shall I like a hermit dwell
On a rock or in a cell
Calling home the smallest part
That is missing of my heart
To bestow it where I may
Meet a rival every day
If she undervalue me
What care I how fair she be

Were her tresses angelgold
If a stranger may be bold
Unrebuked and unafraid
To convert them to a braid
And with little more ado
Work them into bracelets too
If the mine be grown so free
What care I how rich it be

Were her hands as rich a prize
As her hair or precious eyes
If she lay them out to take
Kisses for good manners sake
And let every lover slip
From her hand unto her lip
If she seem not chaste to me
What care I how chaste she be

No She must be perfect snow
In effect as well as show
Warming but as snowballs do
Not like fire by burning too
But when she by change hath got
To her heart a second lot
Then if others share with me
Farewell her whateer she be

Unknown


SONG
From Britannias Pastorals

Shall I tell you whom I love
Hearken then awhile to me
And if such a woman move
As I now shall versify
Be assured tis she or none
That I love and love alone

Nature did her so much right
As she scorns the help of art
In as many virtues dight
As eer yet embraced a heart
So much good so truly tried
Some for less were deified

Wit she hath without desire
To make known how much she hath
And her anger flames no higher
Than may fitly sweeten wrath
Full of pity as may be
Though perhaps not so to me

Reason masters every sense
And her virtues grace her birth
Lovely as all excellence
Modest in her most of mirth
Likelihood enough to prove
Only worth could kindle love

Such she is and if you know
Such a one as I have sung
Be she brown or fair or so
That she be but somewhat young
Be assured tis she or none
That I love and love alone

William Browne 15911643


TO DIANEME

Sweet be not proud of those two eyes
Which starlike sparkle in their skies
Nor be you proud that you can see
All hearts your captives yours yet free
Be you not proud of that rich hair
Which wantons with the lovesick air
Whenas that ruby which you wear
Sunk from the tip of your soft ear
Will last to be a precious stone
When all your world of beautys gone

Robert Herrick 15911674


INGRATEFUL BEAUTY THREATENED

Know Celia since thou art so proud
Twas I that gave thee thy renown
Thou hadst in the forgotten crowd
Of common beauties lived unknown
Had not my verse extolled thy name
And with it imped the wings of Fame

That killing power is none of thine
I gave it to thy voice and eyes
Thy sweets thy graces all are mine
Thou art my star shinst in my skies
Then dart not from thy borrowed sphere
Lightning on him that fixed thee there

Tempt me with such affrights no more
Lest what I made I uncreate
Let fools thy mystic form adore
I know thee in thy mortal state
Wise poets that wrapped Truth in tales
Knew her themselves through all her veils

Thomas Carew 15981639


DISDAIN RETURNED

He that loves a rosy cheek
Or a coral lip admires
Or from starlike eyes doth seek
Fuel to maintain his fires
As old Time makes these decay
So his flames must waste away

But a smooth and steadfast mind
Gentle thoughts and calm desires
Hearts with equal love combined
Kindle neverdying fires 
Where these are not I despise
Lovely cheeks or lips or eyes

No tears Celia now shall win
My resolved heart to return
I have searched thy soul within
And find naught but pride and scorn
I have learned thy arts and now
Can disdain as much as thou

Some power in my revenge convey
That love to her I cast away

Thomas Carew 15981639


LOVE WHO WILL FOR ILL LOVE NONE

Love who will for Ill love none
Theres fools enough beside me
Yet if each woman have not one
Come to me where I hide me
And if she can the place attain
For once Ill be her fool again

It is an easy place to find
And women sure should know it
Yet thither serves not every wind
Nor many men can show it
It is the storehouse where doth lie
All womans truth and constancy

If the journey be so long
No woman will adventer
But dreading her weak vessels wrong
The voyage will not enter
Then may she sigh and lie alone
In love with all yet loved of none

William Browne 15911643


VALERIUS ON WOMEN

She that denies me I would have
Who craves me I despise
Venus hath power to rule mine heart
But not to please mine eyes

Temptations offered I still scorn
Denied I cling them still
Ill neither glut mine appetite
Nor seek to starve my will

Diana doubleclothed offends
So Venus naked quite
The last begets a surfeit and
The other no delight

That crafty girl shall please me best
That no for yea can say
And every wanton willing kiss
Can season with a nay

Thomas Heywood 1650


DISPRAISE OF LOVE AND LOVERS FOLLIES

If love be life I long to die
Live they that list for me
And he that gains the most thereby
A fool at least shall be
But he that feels the sorest fits
Scapes with no less than loss of wits
Unhappy life they gain
Which love do entertain

In day by feigned looks they live
By lying dreams in night
Each frown a deadly wound doth give
Each smile a false delight
Ift hap their lady pleasant seem
It is for others love they deem
If void she seem of joy
Disdain doth make her coy

Such is the peace that lovers find
Such is the life they lead
Blown here and there with every wind
Like flowers in the mead
Now war now peace now war again
Desire despair delight disdain
Though dead in midst of life
In peace and yet at strife

Francis Davison fl 1602


THE CONSTANT LOVER

Out upon it I have loved
Three whole days together
And am like to love three more
If it prove fair weather

Time shall moult away his wings
Ere he shall discover
In the whole wide world again
Such a constant lover

But the spite ont is no praise
Is due at all to me
Love with me had made no stays
Had it any been but she

Had it any been but she
And that very face
There had been at least ere this
A dozen in her place

John Suckling 16091642


SONG
From Aglaura

Why so pale and wan fond lover
Prithee why so pale
Will when looking well cant move her
Looking ill prevail
Prithee why so pale

Why so dull and mute young sinner
Prithee why so mute
Will when speaking well cant win her
Saying nothing dot
Prithee why so mute

Quit quit for shame this will not move
This cannot take her
If of herself she will not love
Nothing can make her
The devil take her

John Suckling 16091642


WISHES TO HIS SUPPOSED MISTRESS

Whoeer she be
That not impossible She
That shall command my heart and me

Whereer she lie
Locked up from mortal eye
In shady leaves of destiny

Till that ripe birth
Of studied Fate stand forth
And teach her fair steps tread our earth

Till that divine
Idea take a shrine
Of crystal flesh through which to shine

Meet you her my Wishes
Bespeak her to my blisses
And be ye called my absent kisses

I wish her Beauty
That owes not all its duty
To gaudy tire or glistering shoetie

Something more than
Taffeta or tissue can
Or rampant feather or rich fan

More than the spoil
Of shop or silkworms toil
Or a bought blush or a set smile

A Face thats best
By its own beauty dressed
And can alone commend the rest

A Face made up
Out of no other shop
Than what Natures white hand sets ope

A Cheek where youth
And blood with pen of truth
Write what the reader sweetly ruth

A Cheek where grows
More than a morning rose
Which to no box its being owes

Lips where all day
A lovers kiss may play
Yet carry nothing thence away

Looks that oppress
Their richest tires but dress
And clothe their simplest nakedness

Eyes that displace
The neighbor diamond and outface
That sunshine by their own sweet grace

Tresses that wear
Jewels but to declare
How much themselves more precious are

Whose native ray
Can tame the wanton day
Of gems that in their bright shades play

Each ruby there
Or pearl that dare appear
Be its own blush be its own tear

A welltamed Heart
For whose more noble smart
Love may be long choosing a dart

Eyes that bestow
Full quivers on Loves bow
Yet pay less arrows than they owe

Smiles that can warm
The blood yet teach a charm
That chastity shall take no harm

Blushes that bin
The burnish of no sin
Nor flames of aught too hot within

Joys that confess
Virtue their mistress
And have no other head to dress

Fears fond and slight
As the coy brides when night
First does the longing lover right

Days that need borrow
No part of their goodmorrow
From a forespent night of sorrow

Days that in spite
Of darkness by the light
Of a clear mind are day all night

Nights sweet as they
Made short by lovers play
Yet long by the absence of the day

Life that dares send
A challenge to his end
And when it comes say Welcome friend

Sydneian showers
Of sweet discourse whose powers
Can crown old Winters head with flowers

Soft silken hours
Open suns shady bowers
Bove all nothing within that lowers

Whateer delight
Can make Days forehead bright
Or give down to the wings of Night

In her whole frame
Have Nature all the name
Art and Ornament the shame

Her flattery
Picture and Poesy
Her counsel her own virtue be

I wish her store
Of worth may leave her poor
Of wishes and I wish  no more

Now if Time knows
That Her whose radiant brows
Weave them a garland of my vows

Her whose just bays
My future hopes can raise
A trophy to her present praise

Her that dares be
What these lines wish to see
I seek no further it is She

Tis She and here
Lo I unclothe and clear
My Wishes cloudy character

May She enjoy it
Whose merit dare apply it
But modesty dares still deny it

Such worth as this is
Shall fix my flying Wishes
And determine them to kisses

Let her full glory
My fancies fly before ye
Be ye my fictions  but her Story

Richard Crashaw 16131649


SONG
From Abdelazer

Love in fantastic triumph sate
Whilst bleeding hearts around him flowed
For whom fresh pains he did create
And strange tyrannic power he showed
From thy bright eyes he took his fires
Which round about in sport he hurled
But twas from mine he took desires
Enough t undo the amorous world

From me he took his sighs and tears
From thee his pride and cruelty
From me his languishments and fears
And every killing dart from thee
Thus thou and I the god have armed
And set him up a deity
But my poor heart alone is harmed
Whilst thine the victor is and free

Aphra Behn 16401689


LES AMOURS

She that I pursue still flies me
Her that follows me I fly
She that I still court denies me
Her that courts me I deny
Thus in one web were subtly wove
And yet we mutiny in love

She that can save me must not do it
She that cannot fain would do
Her love is bound yet I still woo it
Hers by love is bound in woe
Yet how can I of love complain
Since I have love for love again

This is thy work imperious Child
Thines this labyrinth of love
That thus hast our desires beguiled
Nor seest how thine arrows rove
Then prithee to compose this stir
Make her love me or me love her

But if irrevocable are
Those keen shafts that wound us so
Let me prevail with thee thus far
That thou once more take thy bow
Wound her hard heart and by my troth
Ill be content to take them both

Charles Cotton 16301687


RIVALS

Of all the torments all the cares
With which our lives are cursed
Of all the plagues a lover bears
Sure rivals are the worst
By partners in each other kind
Afflictions easier grow
In love alone we hate to find
Companions of our woe

Sylvia for all the pangs you see
Are laboring in my breast
I beg not you would favor me
Would you but slight the rest
How great soeer your rigors are
With them alone Ill cope
I can endure my own despair
But not anothers hope

William Walsh 16631708


I LATELY VOWED BUT TWAS IN HASTE

I lately vowed but twas in haste
That I no more would court
The joys which seem when they are past
As dull as they are short

I oft to hate my mistress swear
But soon my weakness find
I make my oaths when shes severe
But break them when shes kind

John Oldmixon 16731742


THE TOUCHSTONE

A fool and knave with different views
For Julias hand apply
The knave to mend his fortune sues
The fool to please his eye

Ask you how Julia will behave
Depend ont for a rule
If shes a fool shell wed the knave 
If shes a knave the fool

Samuel Bishop 17311795


AIR
From The Duenna

I neer could any luster see
In eyes that would not look on me
I neer saw nectar on a lip
But where my own did hope to sip
Has the maid who seeks my heart
Cheeks of rose untouched by art
I will own the color true
When yielding blushes aid their hue

Is her hand so soft and pure
I must press it to be sure
Nor can I be certain then
Till it grateful press again
Must I with attentive eye
Watch her heaving bosom sigh
I will do so when I see
That heaving bosom sigh for me

Richard Brinsley Sheridan 17511816


I TOOK A HANSOM ON TODAY

I took a hansom on today
For a round I used to know 
That I used to take for a womans sake
In a fever of toandfro

There were the landmarks one and all 
What did they stand to show
Street and square and river were there 
Where was the ancient woe

Never a hint of a challenging hope
Nor a hope laid sick and low
But a longing dead as its kindred sped
A thousand years ago

William Ernest Henley 18491903


DA CAPO

Short and sweet and weve come to the end of it 
Our poor little love lying cold
Shall no sonnet then ever be penned of it
Nor the joys and pains of it told
How fair was its face in the morning
How close its caresses at noon
How its evening grew chill without warning
Unpleasantly soon

I cant say just how we began it 
In a blush or a smile or a sigh
Fate took but an instant to plan it
It needs but a moment to die
Yet  remember that first conversation
When the flowers you had dropped at your feet
I restored The familiar quotation
Was  Sweets to the sweet

Oh their delicate perfume has haunted
My senses a whole season through
If there was one soft charm that you wanted
The violets lent it to you
I whispered you life was but lonely
A cue which you graciously took
And your eyes learned a look for me only 
A very nice look

And sometimes your hand would touch my hand
With a sweetly particular touch
You said many things in a sigh and
Made a look express wondrously much
We smiled for the mere sake of smiling
And laughed for no reason but fun
Irrational joys but beguiling 
And all that is done

We were idle and played for a moment
At a game that now neither will press
I cared not to find out what No meant
Nor your lips to grow yielding with Yes
Love is done with and dead if there lingers
A faint and indefinite ghost
It is laid with this kiss on your fingers 
A jest at the most

Tis a commonplace stale situation
Now the curtain comes down from above
On the end of our little flirtation 
A travesty romance for Love
If he climbed in disguise to your lattice
Fell dead of the first kisses pain
But one thing is left us now that is 
Begin it again

Henry Cuyler Bunner 18551896


SONG AGAINST WOMEN

Why should I sing of women
And the softness of night
When the dawn is loud with battle
And the days teeth bite
And theres a sword to lay my hand to
And a mans fight

Why should I sing of women   
Theres life in the sun
And red adventure calling
Where the roads run
And cheery brews at the tavern
When the days done

Ive sung of a hundred women
In a hundred lands
But all their love is nothing
But drifting sands
Im sick of their tears and kisses
And their pale hands

Ive sung of a hundred women
And their bought lips
But out on the clean horizon
I can hear the whips
Of the white waves lashing the bulwarks
Of great strong ships

And the trails that run to the westward
Are shot with fire
And the winds hurl from the headland
With ancient ire
And all my body itches
With an old desire

So Ill deal no more in women
And the softness of night
But Ill follow the red adventure
And the winds flight
And Ill sing of the sea and of battle
And of mens might

Willard Huntington Wright 18


SONG OF THYRSIS

The turtle on yon withered bough
That lately mourned her murdered mate
Has found another comrade now 
Such changes all await
Again her drooping plume is drest
Again shes willing to be blest
And takes her lover to her nest

If nature has decreed it so
With all above and all below
Let us like them forget our woe
And not be killed with sorrow
If I should quit your arms tonight
And chance to die before twas light
I would advise you  and you might 
Love again tomorrow

Philip Freneau 17521832


THE TEST

I held her hand the pledge of bliss
Her hand that trembled and withdrew
She bent her head before my kiss   
My heart was sure that hers was true
Now I have told her I must part
She shakes my hand she bids adieu
Nor shuns the kiss Alas my heart
Hers never was the heart for you

Walter Savage Landor 17751864


THE FAULT IS NOT MINE

The fault is not mine if I love you too much
I loved you too little too long
Such ever your graces your tenderness such
And the music the heart gave the tongue

A time is now coming when Love must be gone
Though he never abandoned me yet
Acknowledge our friendship our passion disown
Our follies ah can you forget

Walter Savage Lander 17751864


THE SNAKE

My love and I the other day
Within a myrtle arbor lay
When near us from a rosy bed
A little Snake put forth its head

See said the maid with laughing eyes 
Yonder the fatal emblem lies
Who could expect such hidden harm
Beneath the roses velvet charm

Never did moral thought occur
In more unlucky hour than this
For oh I just was leading her
To talk of love and think of bliss

I rose to kill the snake but she
In pity prayed it might not be
No said the girl  and many a spark
Flashed from her eyelid as she said it 
Under the rose or in the dark
One might perhaps have cause to dread it
But when its wicked eyes appear
And when we know for what they wink so
One must be very simple dear
To let it sting one  dont you think so

Thomas Moore 17791852


WHEN I LOVED YOU

When I loved you I cant but allow
I had many an exquisite minute
But the scorn that I feel for you now
Hath even more luxury in it

Thus whether were on or were off
Some witchery seems to await you
To love you is pleasant enough
And oh tis delicious to hate you

Thomas Moore 17791852


A TEMPLE TO FRIENDSHIP

A temple to Friendship said Laura enchanted
Ill build in this garden  the thought is divine
Her temple was built and she now only wanted
An image of Friendship to place on the shrine
She flew to a sculptor who set down before her
A Friendship the fairest his art could invent
But so cold and so dull that the youthful adorer
Saw plainly this was not the idol she meant

O never she cried could I think of enshrining
An image whose looks are so joyless and dim 
But yon little god upon roses reclining
Well make if you please sir a Friendship of him
So the bargain was struck With the little god laden
She joyfully flew to her shrine in the grove
Farewell said the sculptor youre not the first maiden
Who came but for Friendship and took away Love

Thomas Moore 17791852


THE GLOVE AND THE LIONS

King Francis was a hearty king and loved a royal sport
And one day as his lions fought sat looking on the court
The nobles filled the benches and the ladies in their pride
And mongst them sat the Count de Lorge with one for whom he sighed
And truly twas a gallant thing to see that crowning show
Valor and love and a king above and the royal beasts below

Ramped and roared the lions with horrid laughing jaws
They bit they glared gave blows like beams a wind went with their paws
With wallowing might and stifled roar they rolled on one another
Till all the pit with sand and mane was in a thunderous smother
The bloody foam above the bars came whisking through the air
Said Francis then Faith gentlemen were better here than there

De Lorges love oerheard the King a beauteous lively dame
With smiling lips and sharp bright eyes which always seemed the same
She thought The Count my lover is brave as brave can be
He surely would do wondrous things to show his love of me
King ladies lovers all look on the occasion is divine
Ill drop my glove to prove his love great glory will be mine

She dropped her glove to prove his love then looked at him and smiled
He bowed and in a moment leaped among the lions wild
The leap was quick return was quick he has regained his place
Then threw the glove but not with love right in the ladys face
By Heaven said Francis rightly done and he rose from where he sat
No love quoth he but vanity sets love a task like that

Leigh Hunt 17841859


TO WOMAN

Woman experience might have told me
That all must love thee who behold thee
Surely experience might have taught
Thy firmest promises are naught
But placed in all thy charms before me
All I forget but to adore thee
Oh Memory thou choicest blessing
When joined with hope when still possessing
But how much cursed by every lover
When hope is fled and passions over
Woman that fair and fond deceiver
How prompt are striplings to believe her
How throbs the pulse when first we view
The eye that rolls in glossy blue
Or sparkles black or mildly throws
A beam from under hazel brows
How quick we credit every oath
And hear her plight the willing troth
Fondly we hope twill last for aye
When lo she changes in a day
This record will forever stand
Woman thy vows are traced in sand

George Gordon Byron 17881824


LOVES SPITE

You take a town you cannot keep
And forced in turn to fly
Oer ruins you have made shall leap
Your deadliest enemy
Her love is yours  and be it so 
But can you keep it No no no

Upon her brow we gazed with awe
And loved and wished to love in vain
But when the snow begins to thaw
We shun with scorn the miry plain
Women with grace may yield but she
Appeared some Virgin Deity

Bright was her soul as Dians crest
Whitening on Vestas fane its sheen
Cold looked she as the waveless breast
Of some stone Dian at thirteen
Men loved but hope they deemed to be
A sweet Impossibility

Aubrey Thomas De Vere 18141902


LADY CLARA VERE DE VERE

Lady Clara Vere de Vere
Of me you shall not win renown
You thought to break a country heart
For pastime ere you went to town
At me you smiled but unbeguiled
I saw the snare and I retired
The daughter of a hundred earls
You are not one to be desired

Lady Clara Vere de Vere
I know you proud to bear your name
Your pride is yet no mate for mine
Too proud to care from whence I came
Nor would I break for your sweet sake
A heart that dotes on truer charms
A simple maiden in her flower
Is worth a hundred coatsofarms

Lady Clara Vere de Vere
Some meeker pupil you must find
For were you queen of all that is
I could not stoop to such a mind
You sought to prove how I could love
And my disdain is my reply
The lion on your old stone gates
Is not more cold to you than I

Lady Clara Vere de Vere
You put strange memories in my head
Not thrice your branching limes have blown
Since I beheld young Laurence dead
O your sweet eyes your low replies
A great enchantress you may be
But there was that across his throat
Which you had hardly cared to see

Lady Clara Vere de Vere
When thus he met his mothers view
She had the passions of her kind
She spake some certain truths of you
Indeed I heard one bitter word
That scarce is fit for you to hear
Her manners had not that repose
Which stamps the caste of Vere de Vere

Lady Clara Vere de Vere
There stands a specter in your hall
The guilt of blood is at your door
You changed a wholesome heart to gall
You held your course without remorse
To make him trust his modest worth
And last you fixed a vacant stare
And slew him with your noble birth

Trust me Clara Vere de Vere
From yon blue heavens above us bent
The gardener Adam and his wife
Smile at the claims of long descent
Howeer it be it seems to me
Tis only noble to be good
Kind hearts are more than coronets
And simple faith than Norman blood

I know you Clara Vere de Vere
You pine among your halls and towers
The languid light of your proud eyes
Is wearied of the rolling hours
In glowing health with boundless wealth
But sickening of a vague disease
You know so ill to deal with time
You needs must play such pranks as these

Clara Clara Vere de Vere
If time be heavy on your hands
Are there no beggars at your gate
Nor any poor about your lands
O teach the orphanboy to read
Or teach the orphangirl to sew
Pray Heaven for a human heart
And let the foolish yeoman go

Alfred Tennyson 18091892


SHADOWS

They seemed to those who saw them meet
The casual friends of every day
Her smile was undisturbed and sweet
His courtesy was free and gay

But yet if one the others name
In some unguarded moment heard
The heart you thought so calm and tame
Would struggle like a captured bird

And letters of mere formal phrase
Were blistered with repeated tears 
And this was not the work of days
But had gone on for years and years

Alas that love was not too strong
For maiden shame and manly pride
Alas that they delayed so long
The goal of mutual bliss beside

Yet what no chance could then reveal
And neither would be first to own
Let fate and courage now conceal
When truth could bring remorse alone

Richard Monckton Milnes 18091885


SORROWS OF WERTHER

Werther had a love for Charlotte
Such as words could never utter
Would you know how first he met her
She was cutting bread and butter

Charlotte was a married lady
And a moral man was Werther
And for all the wealth of Indies
Would do nothing for to hurt her

So he sighed and pined and ogled
And his passion boiled and bubbled
Till he blew his silly brains out
And no more was by it troubled

Charlotte having seen his body
Borne before her on a shutter
Like a wellconducted person
Went on cutting bread and butter

William Makepeace Thackeray 18111863


THE AGE OF WISDOM

Ho pretty page with the dimpled chin
That never has known the barbers shear
All your wish is woman to win
This is the way that boys begin 
Wait till you come to Forty Year

Curly gold locks cover foolish brains
Billing and cooing is all your cheer
Sighing and singing of midnight strains
Under Bonnybells windowpanes 
Wait till you come to Forty Year

Forty times over let Michaelmas pass
Grizzling hair the brain does clear 
Then you know a boy is an ass
Then you know the worth of a lass
Once you have come to Forty Year

Pledge me round I bid ye declare
All good fellows whose beards are gray
Did not the fairest of the fair
Common grow and wearisome ere
Ever a month was passed away

The reddest lips that ever have kissed
The brightest eyes that ever have shone
May pray and whisper and we not list
Or look away and never be missed
Ere yet ever a month is gone

Gillians dead God rest her bier
How I loved her twenty years syne
Marians married but I sit here
Alone and merry at Forty Year
Dipping my nose in the Gascon wine

William Makepeace Thackeray 18111863


ANDREA DEL SARTO
Called The Faultless Painter

But do not let us quarrel any more
No my Lucrezia bear with me for once
Sit down and all shall happen as you wish
You turn your face but does it bring your heart
Ill work then for your friends friend never fear
Treat his own subject after his own way
Fix his own time accept too his own price
And shut the money into this small hand
When next it takes mine Will it tenderly
Oh Ill content him  but tomorrow Love
I often am much wearier than you think
This evening more than usual and it seems
As if  forgive now  should you let me sit
Here by the window with your hand in mine
And look a halfhour forth on Fiesole
Both of one mind as married people use
Quietly quietly the evening through
I might get up tomorrow to my work
Cheerful and fresh as ever Let us try
Tomorrow how you shall be glad for this
Your soft hand is a woman of itself
And mine the mans bared breast she curls inside
Dont count the time lost neither you must serve
For each of the five pictures we require
It saves a model So keep looking so
My serpentining beauty rounds on rounds
 How could you ever prick those perfect ears
Even to put the pearl there oh so sweet 
My face my moon my everybodys moon
Which everybody looks on and calls his
And I suppose is looked on by in turn
While she looks  no ones very dear no less
You smile why theres my picture ready made
Theres what we painters call our harmony
A common grayness silvers everything 
All in a twilight you and I alike
 You at the point of your first pride in me
Thats gone you know  but I at every point
My youth my hope my art being all toned down
To yonder sober pleasant Fiesole
Theres the bell clinking from the chapeltop
That length of convent wall across the way
Holds the trees safer huddled more inside
The last monk leaves the garden days decrease
And autumn grows autumn in everything
Eh the whole seems to fall into a shape
As if I saw alike my work and self
And all that I was born to be and do
A twilightpiece Love we are in Gods hand
How strange now looks the life he makes us lead
So free we seem so fettered fast we are
I feel he laid the fetter let it lie
This chamber for example  turn your head 
All thats behind us You dont understand
Nor care to understand about my art
But you can hear at least when people speak
And that cartoon the second from the door
 It is the thing Love so such thing should be 
Behold Madonna  I am bold to say
I can do with my pencil what I know
What I see what at bottom of my heart
I wish for if I ever wish so deep 
Do easily too  when I say perfectly
I do not boast perhaps yourself are judge
Who listened to the Legates talk last week
And just as much they used to say in France
At any rate tis easy all of it
No sketches first no studies thats long past
I do what many dream of all their lives
 Dream strive to do and agonize to do
And fail in doing I could count twenty such
On twice your fingers and not leave this town
Who strive  you dont know how the others strive
To paint a little thing like that you smeared
Carelessly passing with your robes afloat 
Yet do much less so much less Someone says
I know his name no matter  so much less
Well less is more Lucrezia I am judged
There burns a truer light of God in them
In their vexed beating stuffed and stoppedup brain
Heart or whateer else than goes on to prompt
This lowpulsed forthright craftsmans hand of mine
Their works drop groundward but themselves I know
Reach many a time a heaven thats shut to me
Enter and take their place there sure enough
Though they come back and cannot tell the world
My works are nearer heaven but I sit here
The sudden blood of these men at a word 
Praise them it boils or blame them it boils too
I painting from myself and to myself
Know what I do am unmoved by mens blame
Or their praise either Somebody remarks
Morellos outline there is wrongly traced
His hue mistaken what of that or else
Rightly traced and well ordered what of that
Speak as they please what does the mountain care
Ah but a mans reach should exceed his grasp
Or whats a heaven for All is silvergray
Placid and perfect with my art the worse
I know both what I want and what might gain
And yet how profitless to know to sigh
Had I been two another and myself
Our head would have oerlooked the world No doubt
Yonders a work now of that famous youth
The Urbinate who died five years ago
Tis copied George Vasari sent it me
Well I can fancy how he did it all
Pouring his soul with kings and popes to see
Reaching that heaven might so replenish him
Above and through his art  for it gives way
That arm is wrongly put  and there again 
A fault to pardon in the drawings lines
Its body so to speak its soul is right
He means right  that a child may understand
Still what an arm and I could alter it
But all the play the insight and the stretch 
Out of me out of me And wherefore out
Had you enjoined them on me given me soul
We might have risen to Rafael I and you
Nay Love you did give all I asked I think 
More than I merit yes by many times
But had you  oh with the same perfect brow
And perfect eyes and more than perfect mouth
And the low voice my soul hears as a bird
The fowlers pipe and follows to the snare 
Had you with these the same but brought a mind
Some women do so Had the mouth there urged
God and the glory never care for gain
The present by the future what is that
Live for fame side by side with Agnolo
Rafael is waiting up to God all three
I might have done it for you So it seems
Perhaps not All is as God overrules
Beside incentives come from the souls self
The rest avail not Why do I need you
What wife had Rafael or has Agnolo
In this world who can do a thing will not
And who would do it cannot I perceive
Yet the wills somewhat  somewhat too the power 
And thus we halfmen struggle At the end
God I conclude compensates punishes
Tis safer for me if the award be strict
That I am something underrated here
Poor this long while despised to speak the truth
I dared not do you know leave home all day
For fear of chancing on the Paris lords
The best is when they pass and look aside
But they speak sometimes I must bear it all
Well may they speak That Francis that first time
And that long festal year at Fontainebleau
I surely then could sometimes leave the ground
Put on the glory Rafaels daily wear
In that humane great monarchs golden look 
One finger in his beard or twisted curl
Over his mouths good mark that made the smile
One arm about my shoulder round my neck
The jingle of his gold chain in my ear
I painting proudly with his breath on me
All his court round him seeing with his eyes
Such frank French eyes and such a fire of souls
Profuse my hand kept plying by those hearts 
And best of all this this this face beyond
This in the background waiting on my work
To crown the issue with a last reward
A good time was it not my kingly days
And had you not grown restless    but I know 
Tis done and past twas right my instinct said
Too live the life grew golden and not gray
And Im the weakeyed bat no sun should tempt
Out of the grange whose four walls make his world
How could it end in any other way
You called me and I came home to your heart
The triumph was  to reach and stay there since
I reached it ere the triumph what is lost
Let my hands frame your face in your hairs gold
You beautiful Lucrezia that are mine
Rafael did this Andrea painted that
The Romans is the better when you pray
But still the others Virgin was his wife 
Men will excuse me I am glad to judge
Both pictures in your presence clearer grows
My better fortune I resolve to think
For do you know Lucrezia as God lives
Said one day Agnolo his very self
To Rafael    I have known it all these years   
When the young man was flaming out his thoughts
Upon a palacewall for Rome to see
Too lifted up in heart because of it
Friend theres a certain sorry little scrub
Goes up and down our Florence none cares how
Who were he set to plan and execute
As you are pricked on by your popes and kings
Would bring the sweat into that brow of yours
To Rafaels And indeed the arm is wrong
I hardly dare    yet only you to see
Give the chalk here  quick thus the line should go
Ay but the soul hes Rafael rub it out
Still all I care for if he spoke the truth
What he why who but Michel Agnolo
Do you forget already words like those
If really there was such a chance so lost 
Is whether youre  not grateful  but more pleased
Well let me think so And you smile indeed
This hour has been an hour Another smile
If you would sit thus by me every night
I should work better do you comprehend
I mean that I should earn more give you more
See it is settled dusk now theres a star
Morellos gone the watchlights show the wall
The cueowls speak the name we call them by
Come from the window love  come in at last
Inside the melancholy little house
We built to be so gay with God is just
King Francis may forgive me oft at nights
When I look up from painting eyes tired out
The walls become illumined brick from brick
Distinct instead of mortar fierce bright gold
That gold of his I did cement them with
Let us but love each other Must you go
That Cousin here again he waits outside
Must see you  you and not with me Those loans
More gaming debts to pay you smiled for that
Well let smiles buy me have you more to spend
While hand and eye and something of a heart
Are left me works my ware and whats it worth
Ill pay my fancy Only let me sit
The gray remainder of the evening out
Idle you call it and muse perfectly
How I could paint were I but back in France
One picture just one more  the Virgins face
Not yours this time I want you at my side
To hear them  that is Michel Agnolo 
Judge all I do and tell you of its worth
Will you Tomorrow satisfy your friend
I take the subjects for his corridor
Finish the portrait out of hand  there there
And throw him in another thing or two
If he demurs the whole should prove enough
To pay for this same Cousins freak Beside
Whats better and whats all I care about
Get you the thirteen scudi for the ruff
Love does that please you Ah but what does he
The Cousin what does he to please you more

I am grown peaceful as old age tonight
I regret little I would change still less
Since there my past life lies why alter it
The very wrong to Francis  it is true
I took his coin was tempted and complied
And built this house and sinned and all is said
My father and my mother died of want
Well had I riches of my own you see
How one gets rich Let each one bear his lot
They were born poor lived poor and poor they died
And I have labored somewhat in my time
And not been paid profusely Some good son
Paint my two hundred pictures  let him try
No doubt theres something strikes a balance Yes
You loved me quite enough it seems tonight
This must suffice me here What would one have
In heaven perhaps new chances one more chance 
Four great walls in the New Jerusalem
Meted on each side by the angels reed
For Leonard Rafael Agnolo and me
To cover  the three first without a wife
While I have mine So  still they overcome
Because theres still Lucrezia  as I choose

Again the Cousins whistle Go my love

Robert Browning 18121889


MY LAST DUCHESS
Ferrara

Thats my last Duchess painted on the wall
Looking as if she were alive I call
That piece a wonder now Fra Pandolfs hands
Worked busily a day and there she stands
Willt please you sit and look at her I said
Fra Pandolf by design for never read
Strangers like you that pictured countenance
The depth and passion of its earnest glance
But to myself they turned since none puts by
The curtain I have drawn for you but I
And seemed as they would ask me if they durst
How such a glance came there so not the first
Are you to turn and ask thus Sir twas not
Her husbands presence only called that spot
Of joy into the Duchess cheek perhaps
Fra Pandolf chanced to say Her mantle laps
Over my ladys wrist too much or Paint
Must never hope to reproduce the faint
Halfflush that dies along her throat such stuff
Was courtesy she thought and cause enough
For calling up that spot of joy She had
A heart  how shall I say  too soon made glad
Too easily impressed she liked whateer
She looked on and her looks went everywhere
Sir twas all one My favor at her breast
The dropping of the daylight in the West
The bough of cherries some officious fool
Broke in the orchard for her the white mule
She rode with round the terrace  all and each
Would draw from her alike the approving speech
Or blush at least She thanked men  good but thanked
Somehow  I know not how  as if she ranked
My gift of a nine hundredyearsold name
With anybodys gift Whod stoop to blame
This sort of trifling Even had you skill
In speech  which I have not  to make your will
Quite clear to such an one and say Just this
Or that in you disgusts me here you miss
Or there exceed the mark  and if she let
Herself be lessoned so nor plainly set
Her wits to yours forsooth and made excuse
 Een then would be some stooping and I choose
Never to stoop Oh sir she smiled no doubt
Wheneer I passed her but who passed without
Much the same smile This grew I gave commands
Then all smiles stopped together There she stands
As if alive Willt please you rise Well meet
The company below then I repeat
The Count your masters known munificence
Is ample warrant that no just pretense
Of mine for dowry will be disallowed
Though his fair daughters self as I avowed
At starting is my object Nay well go
Together down sir Notice Neptune though
Taming a seahorse thought a rarity
Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me

Robert Browning 18121889


ADAM LILITH AND EVE

One day it thundered and lightened
Two women fairly frightened
Sank to their knees transformed transfixed
At the feet of the man who sat betwixt
And Mercy cried each  if I tell the truth
Of a passage in my youth

Said This Do you mind the morning
I met your love with scorning
As the worst of the venom left my lips
I thought If despite this lie he strips
The mask from my soul with a kiss  I crawl
His slave  soul body and all

Said That We stood to be married
The priest or some one tarried
If Paradisedoor prove locked smiled you
I thought as I nodded smiling too
Did one thats away arrive  nor late
Nor soon should unlock Hells gate

It ceased to lighten and thunder
Up started both in wonder
Looked around and saw that the sky was clear
Then laughed Confess you believed us Dear
I saw through the joke the man replied
They reseated themselves beside

Robert Browning 18121889


THE LOST MISTRESS

Alls over then does truth sound bitter
As one at first believes
Hark tis the sparrows goodnight twitter
About your cottage eaves

And the leafbuds on the vine are woolly
I noticed that today
One day more bursts them open fully
 You know the red turns gray

Tomorrow we meet the same then dearest
May I take your hand in mine
Mere friends are we  well friends the merest
Keep much that I resign

For each glance of the eye so bright and black
Though I keep with hearts endeavor 
Your voice when you wish the snowdrops back
Though it stay in my soul forever 

Yet I will but say what mere friends say
Or only a thought stronger
I will hold your hand but as long as all may
Or so very little longer

Robert Browning 18121889


FRIEND AND LOVER

When Psyches friend becomes her lover
How sweetly these conditions blend
But oh what anguish to discover
Her lover has become  her friend

Mary Ainge de Vere 18441920


LOST LOVE

Who wins his Love shall lose her
Who loses her shall gain
For still the spirit wooes her
A soul without a stain
And Memory still pursues her
With longings not in vain

He loses her who gains her
Who watches day by day
The dust of time that stains her
The griefs that leave her gray
The flesh that yet enchains her
Whose grace hath passed away

Oh happier he who gains not
The Love some seem to gain
The joy that custom stains not
Shall still with him remain
The loveliness that wanes not
The Love that neer can wane

In dreams she grows not older
The lands of Dream among
Though all the world wax colder
Though all the songs be sung
In dreams doth he behold her
Still fair and kind and young

Andrew Lang 18441912


VOBISCUM EST IOPE

When thou must home to shades of underground
And there arrived a new admired guest
The beauteous spirits do engirt thee round
White Iope blithe Helen and the rest
To hear the stories of thy finished love
From that smooth tongue whose music hell can move

Then wilt thou speak of banqueting delights
Of masques and revels which sweet youth did make
Of tourneys and great challenges of knights
And all these triumphs for thy beautys sake
When thou hast told these honors done to thee
Then tell O tell how thou didst murder me

Thomas Campion  1619


FOUR WINDS

Four winds blowing through the sky
You have seen poor maidens die
Tell me then what I shall do
That my lover may be true
Said the wind from out the south
Lay no kiss upon his mouth
And the wind from out the west
Wound the heart within his breast
And the wind from out the east
Send him empty from the feast
And the wind from out the north
In the tempest thrust him forth
When thou art more cruel than he
Then will Love be kind to thee

Sara Teasdale 18841933


TO MANON
As To His Choice Of Her

If I had chosen thee thou shouldst have been
A virgin proud untamed immaculate
Chaste as the morning star a saint a queen
Scarred by no wars no violence of hate
Thou shouldst have been of soul commensurate
With thy fair body brave and virtuous
And kind and just and if of poor estate
At least an honest woman for my house
I would have had thee come of honored blood
And honorable nurture Thou shouldst bear
Sons to my pride and daughters to my heart
And men should hold thee happy wise and good
Lo thou art none of this but only fair
Yet must I love thee dear and as thou art

Wilfrid Scawen Blunt 18401922


CROWNED

You came to me bearing bright roses
Red like the wine of your heart
You twisted them into a garland
To set me aside from the mart
Red roses to crown me your lover
And I walked aureoled and apart

Enslaved and encircled I bore it
Proud token of my gift to you
The petals waned paler and shriveled
And dropped and the thorns started through
Bitter thorns to proclaim me your lover
A diadem woven with rue

Amy Lowell 18741925


HEBE

I saw the twinkle of white feet
I saw the flash of robes descending
Before her ran an influence fleet
That bowed my heart like barley bending

As in bare fields the searching bees
Pilot to blooms beyond our finding
It led me on by sweet degrees
Joys simple honeycells unbinding

Those Graces were that seemed grim Fates
With nearer love the sky leaned oer me
The longsought Secrets golden gates
On musical hinges swung before me

I saw the brimmed bowl in her grasp
Thrilling with godhood like a lover
I sprang the proffered life to clasp 
The beaker fell the luck was over

The Earth has drunk the vintage up
What boots it patch the goblets splinters
Can Summer fill the icy cup
Whose treacherous crystal is but Winters

O spendthrift haste await the Gods
Their nectar crowns the lips of Patience
Haste scatters on unthankful sods
The immortal gift in vain libations

Coy Hebe flies from those that woo
And shuns the hands would seize upon her
Follow thy life and she will sue
To pour for thee the cup of honor

James Russell Lowell 18191891


JUSTINE YOU LOVE ME NOT
Helas vous ne maimez pas  Piron

I know Justine you speak me fair
As often as we meet
And tis a luxury I swear
To hear a voice so sweet
And yet it does not please me quite
The civil way youve got
For me youre something too polite 
Justine you love me not

I know Justine you never scold
At aught that I may do
If I am passionate or cold
Tis all the same to you
A charming temper say the men
To smooth a husbands lot
I wish twere ruffled now and then 
Justine you love me not

I know Justine you wear a smile
As beaming as the sun
But who supposes all the while
It shines for only one
Though azure skies are fair to see
A transient cloudy spot
In yours would promise more to me 
Justine you love me not

I know Justine you make my name
Your eulogistic theme
And say  if any chance to blame 
You hold me in esteem
Such words for all their kindly scope
Delight me not a jot
Just as you would have praised the Pope 
Justine you love me not

I know Justine  for I have heard
What friendly voices tell 
You do not blush to say the word
You like me passing well
And thus the fatal sound I hear
That seals my lonely lot
Theres nothing now to hope or fear 
Justine you love me not

John Godfrey Saxe 18161887


SNOWDROP

When full of warm and eager love
I clasp you in my fond embrace
You gently push me back and say
Take care my dear youll spoil my lace

You kiss me just as you would kiss
Some woman friend you chanced to see
You call me dearest  All loves forms
Are yours not its reality

Oh Annie cry and storm and rave
Do anything with passion in it
Hate me an hour and then turn round
And love me truly just one minute

William Wetmore Story 18191895


WHEN THE SULTAN GOES TO ISPAHAN

When the Sultan ShahZaman
Goes to the city Ispahan
Even before he gets so far
As the place where the clustered palmtrees are
At the last of the thirty palacegates
The flower of the harem RoseinBloom
Orders a feast in his favorite room 
Glittering squares of colored ice
Sweetened with syrop tinctured with spice
Creams and cordials and sugared dates
Syrian apples Othmanee quinces
Limes and citrons and apricots
And wines that are known to Eastern princes
And Nubian slaves with smoking pots
Of spiced meats and costliest fish
And all that the curious palate could wish
Pass in and out of the cedarn doors
Scattered over mosaic floors
Are anemones myrtles and violets
And a musical fountain throws its jets
Of a hundred colors into the air
The dusk Sultana loosens her hair
And stains with the hennaplant the tips
Of her pointed nails and bites her lips
Till they bloom again but alas that rose
Not for the Sultan buds and blows
Not for the Sultan ShahZaman
When he goes to the city Ispahan

Then at a wave of her sunny hand
The dancinggirls of Samarcand
Glide in like shapes from fairyland
Making a sudden mist in air
Of fleecy veils and floating hair
And white arms lifted Orient blood
Runs in their veins shines in their eyes
And there in this Eastern Paradise
Filled with the breath of sandalwood
And Khoten musk and aloes and myrrh
Sits RoseinBloom on a silk divan
Sipping the wines of Astrakhan
And her Arab lover sits with her
Thats when the Sultan ShahZaman
Goes to the city Ispahan

Now when I see an extra light
Flaming flickering on the night
From my neighbors casement opposite
I know as well as I know to pray
I know as well as a tongue can say
That the innocent Sultan ShahZaman
Has gone to the city Ispahan

Thomas Bailey Aldrich 18371907


THE SHADOW DANCE

She sees her image in the glass 
How fair a thing to gaze upon
She lingers while the moments run
With happy thoughts that come and pass

Like winds across the meadow grass
When the young June is just begun
She sees her image in the glass 
How fair a thing to gaze upon

What wealth of gold the skies amass
How glad are all things neath the sun
How true the love her love has won
She recks not that this hour will pass 
She sees her image in the glass

Louise Chandler Moulton 18351908


ALONG THE FIELD AS WE CAME BY

Along the field as we came by
A year ago my love and I
The aspen over stile and stone
Was talking to itself alone
Oh who are these that kiss and pass
A country lover and his lass
Two lovers looking to be wed
And time shall put them both to bed
But she shall lie with earth above
And he beside another love

And sure enough beneath the tree
There walks another love with me
And overhead the aspen heaves
Its rainysounding silver leaves
And I spell nothing in their stir
But now perhaps they speak to her
And plain for her to understand
They talk about a time at hand
When I shall sleep with clover clad
And she beside another lad

Alfred Edward Housman 18591936


WHEN I WAS ONEANDTWENTY

When I was oneandtwenty
I heard a wise man say
Give crowns and pounds and guineas
But not your heart away
Give pearls away and rubies
But keep your fancy free
But I was oneandtwenty
No use to talk to me

When I was oneandtwenty
I heard him say again
The heart out of the bosom
Was never given in vain
Tis paid with sighs a plenty
And sold for endless rue
And I am twoandtwenty
And oh tis true tis true

Alfred Edward Housman 18591936


GRIEVE NOT LADIES

Oh grieve not Ladies if at night
Ye wake to feel your beauty going
It was a web of frail delight
Inconstant as an April snowing

In other eyes in other lands
In deep fair pools new beauty lingers
But like spent water in your hands
It runs from your reluctant fingers

You shall not keep the singing lark
That owes to earlier skies its duty
Weep not to hear along the dark
The sound of your departing beauty

The fine and anguished ear of night
Is tuned to hear the smallest sorrow
Oh wait until the morning light
It may not seem so gone tomorrow

But honeypale and rosyred
Brief lights that make a little shining
Beautiful looks about us shed 
They leave us to the old repining

Think not the watchful dim despair
Has come to you the first sweethearted
For oh the gold in Helens hair
And how she cried when that departed

Perhaps that one that took the most
The swiftest borrower wildest spender
May count as we would not the cost 
And grow more true to us and tender

Happy are we if in his eyes
We see no shadow of forgetting
Nay  if our star sinks in those skies
We shall not wholly see its setting

Then let us laugh as do the brooks
That such immortal youth is ours
If memory keeps for them our looks
As fresh as are the springtime flowers

So grieve not Ladies if at night
Ye wake to feel the cold December
Rather recall the early light
And in your loved ones arms remember

Anna Hempstead Branch 18


SUBURB

Dull and hard the low wind creaks
Among the rustling pampas plumes
Drearily the year consumes
Its fiftytwo insipid weeks

Most of the graygreen meadow land
Was sold in parsimonious lots
The dingy houses stand
Pressed by some stout contractors hand
Tightly together in their plots

Through builded banks the sullen river
Gropes where its houses crouch and shiver
Over the bridge the tyrant train
Shrieks and emerges on the plain

In all the better gardens you may pass
Product of many careful Saturdays
Large red geraniums and tall pampas grass
Adorn the plots and mark the gravelled ways

Sometimes in the background may be seen
A private summerhouse in white or green
Here on warm nights the daughter brings
Her vacillating clerk
To talk of small exciting things
And touch his fingers through the dark

He in the uncomfortable breach
Between her trilling laughters
Promises in halting speech
Hopeless immense Hereafters

She trembles like the pampas plumes
Her strained lips haggle He assumes
The serious quest   

Now as the train is whistling past
He takes her in his arms at last

Its done She blushes at his side
Across the lawn  a bride a bride

       

The stout contractor will design
The lazy laborers will prepare
Another villa on the line
In the little gardensquare
Pampas grass will rustle there

Harold Monro 18791932


THE BETROTHED
You must choose between me and your cigar 
Breach of Promise case circa 1885

Open the old cigarbox get me a Cuba stout
For things are running crossways and Maggie and I are out

We quarreled about Havanas  we fought oer a good cheroot 
And I know she is exacting and she says I am a brute

Open the old cigarbox  let me consider a space
In the soft blue veil of the vapor musing on Maggies face

Maggie is pretty to look at  Maggies a loving lass
But the prettiest cheeks must wrinkle the truest of loves must pass

Theres peace in a Laranaga theres calm in a Henry Clay
But the best cigar in an hour is finished and thrown away 

Thrown away for another as perfect and ripe and brown 
But I never could throw away Maggie for fear o the talk o the town

Maggie my wife at fifty  gray and dour and old 
With never another Maggie to purchase for love or gold

And the light of Days that have Been the dark of the Days that Are
And Loves torch stinking and stale like the butt of a dead cigar 

The butt of a dead cigar you are bound to keep in your pocket 
With never a new one to light though its charred and black to the socket

Open the old cigarbox  let me consider awhile
Here is a mild Manilla  there is a wifely smile

Which is the better portion  bondage bought with a ring
Or a harem of dusky beauties fifty tied in a string

Counselors cunning and silent  comforters true and tried
And never a one of the fifty to sneer at a rival bride

Thought in the early morning solace in time of woes
Peace in the hush of the twilight balm ere my eyelids close

This will the fifty give me asking naught in return
With only a Suttees passion  to do their duty and burn

This will the fifty give me When they are spent and dead
Five times other fifties shall be my servants instead

The furrows of faroff Java the isles of the Spanish Main
When they hear that my harem is empty will send me my brides again

I will take no heed to their raiment nor food for their mouths withal
So long as the gulls are nesting so long as the showers fall

I will scentem with best vanilla with tea will I temper their hides
And the Moor and the Mormon shall envy who read of the tale of my brides

For Maggie has written a letter to give me my choice between
The wee little whimpering Love and the great god Nick o Teen

And I have been servant of Love for barely a twelvemonth clear
But I have been Priest of Partagas a matter of seven year

And the gloom of my bachelor days is flecked with the cheery light
Of stumps that I burned to Friendship and Pleasure and Work and Fight

And I turn my eyes to the future that Maggie and I must prove
But the only light on the marshes is the WillotheWisp of Love

Will it see me safe through my journey or leave me bogged in the mire
Since a puff of tobacco can cloud it shall I follow the fitful fire

Open the old cigarbox  let me consider anew 
Old friends and who is Maggie that I should abandon you

A million surplus Maggies are willing to bear the yoke
And a woman is only a woman but a good cigar is a Smoke

Light me another Cuba  I hold to my firstsworn vows
If Maggie will have no rival Ill have no Maggie for spouse

Rudyard Kipling 18651936







LOVES SADNESS






THE NIGHT HAS A THOUSAND EYES

The night has a thousand eyes
And the day but one
Yet the light of the bright world dies
With the dying sun

The mind has a thousand eyes
And the heart but one
Yet the light of a whole life dies
When love is done

Francis William Bourdillon 18521921


I SAW MY LADY WEEP

I saw my Lady weep
And Sorrow proud to be advanced so
In those fair eyes where all perfections keep
Her face was full of Woe
But such a Woe believe me as wins more hearts
Than Mirth can do with her enticing parts

Sorrow was there made fair
And Passion wise Tears a delightful thing
Silence beyond all speech a wisdom rare
She made her sighs to sing
And all things with so sweet a sadness move
As made my heart at once both grieve and love

O fairer than aught else
The world can show leave off in time to grieve
Enough enough your joyful look excels
Tears kill the heart believe
O strive not to be excellent in Woe
Which only breeds your beautys overthrow

LOVES YOUNG DREAM

Oh the days are gone when Beauty bright
My hearts chain wove
When my dream of life from morn till night
Was love still love
New hope may bloom
And days may come
Of milder calmer beam
But theres nothing half so sweet in life
As loves young dream
No theres nothing half so sweet in life
As loves young dream

Though the bard to purer fame may soar
When wild youths past
Though he win the wise who frowned before
To smile at last
Hell never meet
A joy so sweet
In all his noon of fame
As when first he sung to womans ear
His soulfelt flame
And at every close she blushed to hear
The one loved name

No  that hallowed form is neer forgot
Which first love traced
Still it lingering haunts the greenest spot
On memorys waste
Twas odor fled
As soon as shed
Twas mornings winged dream
Twas a light that neer can shine again
On lifes dull stream
Oh twas light that neer can shine again
On lifes dull stream

Thomas Moore 17791852


NOT OURS THE VOWS

Not ours the vows of such as plight
Their troth in sunny weather
While leaves are green and skies are bright
To walk on flowers together

But we have loved as those who tread
The thorny path of sorrow
With clouds above and cause to dread
Yet deeper gloom tomorrow

That thorny path those stormy skies
Have drawn our spirits nearer
And rendered us by sorrows ties
Each to the other dearer

Love born in hours of joy and mirth
With mirth and joy may perish
That to which darker hours gave birth
Still more and more we cherish

It looks beyond the clouds of time
And through deaths shadowy portal
Made by adversity sublime
By faith and hope immortal

Bernard Barton 17841849


THE GRAVE OF LOVE

I dug beneath the cypress shade
What well might seem an elfins grave
And every pledge in earth I laid
That erst thy false affection gave

I pressed them down the sod beneath
I placed one mossy stone above
And twined the roses fading wreath
Around the sepulcher of love

Frail as thy love the flowers were dead
Ere yet the evening sun was set
But years shall see the cypress spread
Immutable as my regret

Thomas Love Peacock 17851866


WELL GO NO MORE A ROVING

So well go no more a roving
So late into the night
Though the heart be still as loving
And the moon be still as bright

For the sword outwears its sheath
And the soul wears out the breast
And the heart must pause to breathe
And Love itself have rest

Though the night was made for loving
And the day returns too soon
Yet well go no more a roving
By the light of the moon

George Gordon Byron 17881824


SONG

Sing the old song amid the sounds dispersing
That burden treasured in your hearts too long
Sing it with voice lowbreathed but never name her
She will not hear you in her turrets nursing
High thoughts too high to mate with mortal song 
Bend oer her gentle Heaven but do not claim her

In twilight caves and secret lonelinesses
She shades the bloom of her unearthly days
And the soft winds alone have power to woo her
Far off we catch the dark gleam of her tresses
And wild birds haunt the woodwalks where she strays
Intelligible music warbling to her

That Spirit charged to follow and defend her 
He also doubtless suffers this lovepain
And she perhaps is sad hearing his sighing
And yet that face is not so sad as tender
Like some sweet singers when her sweetest strain
From the heaved heart is gradually dying

Aubrey Thomas De Vere 18141902


THE QUESTION

I dreamed that as I wandered by the way
Bare Winter suddenly was changed to Spring
And gentle odors led my steps astray
Mixed with a sound of waters murmuring
Along a shelving bank of turf which lay
Under a copse and hardly dared to fling
Its green arms round the bosom of the stream
But kissed it and then fled as thou mightest in dream

There grew pied windflowers and violets
Daisies those pearled Arcturi of the earth
The constellated flower that never sets
Faint oxlips tender bluebells at whose birth
The sod scarce heaved and that tall flower that wets 
Like a child half in tenderness and mirth 
Its mothers face with heavencollected tears
When the low wind its playmates voice it hears

And in the warm hedge grew lush eglantine
Green cowbind and the moonlightcolored may
And cherryblossoms and white cups whose wine
Was the bright dew yet drained not by the day
And wild roses and ivy serpentine
With its dark buds and leaves wandering astray
And flowers azure black and streaked with gold
Fairer than any wakened eyes behold

And nearer to the rivers trembling edge
There grew broad flagflowers purple pranked with white
And starry riverbuds among the sedge
And floating waterlilies broad and bright
Which lit the oak that overhung the hedge
With moonlight beams of their own watery light
And bulrushes and reeds of such deep green
As soothed the dazzled eye with sober sheen

Methought that of these visionary flowers
I made a nosegay bound in such a way
That the same hues which in their natural bowers
Were mingled or opposed the like array
Kept these imprisoned children of the Hours
Within my hand  and then elate and gay
I hastened to the spot whence I had come
That I might there present it  O to whom

Percy Bysshe Shelley 17921822


THE WANDERER

Love comes back to his vacant dwelling 
The old old Love that we knew of yore
We see him stand by the open door
With his great eyes sad and his bosom swelling

He makes as though in our arms repelling
He fain would lie as he lay before 
Love comes back to his vacant dwelling 
The old old Love that we knew of yore

Ah who shall keep us from overspelling
That sweet forgotten forbidden lore
Een as we doubt in our hearts once more
With a rush of tears to our eyelids welling
Love comes back to his vacant dwelling

Austin Dobson 18401921


EGYPTIAN SERENADE

Sing again the song you sung
When we were together young 
When there were but you and I
Underneath the summer sky

Sing the song and oer and oer
Though I know that nevermore
Will it seem the song you sung
When we were together young

George William Curtis 18241892


THE WATER LADY

Alas the moon should ever beam
To show what man should never see
I saw a maiden on a stream
And fair was she

I stayed awhile to see her throw
Her tresses back that all beset
The fair horizon of her brow
With clouds of jet

I stayed a little while to view
Her cheek that wore in place of red
The bloom of water tender blue
Daintily spread

I stayed to watch a little space
Her parted lips if she would sing
The waters closed above her face
With many a ring

And still I stayed a little more
Alas she never comes again
I throw my flowers from the shore
And watch in vain

I know my life will fade away
I know that I must vainly pine
For I am made of mortal clay
But shes divine

Thomas Hood 17991845


TRIPPING DOWN THE FIELDPATH

Tripping down the fieldpath
Early in the morn
There I met my own love
Midst the golden corn
Autumn winds were blowing
As in frolic chase
All her silken ringlets
Backward from her face
Little time for speaking
Had she for the wind
Bonnet scarf or ribbon
Ever swept behind

Still some sweet improvement
In her beauty shone
Every graceful movement
Won me  one by one
As the breath of Venus
Seemed the breeze of morn
Blowing thus between us
Midst the golden corn
Little time for wooing
Had we for the wind
Still kept on undoing
What we sought to bind

Oh that autumn morning
In my heart it beams
Loves last look adorning
With its dream of dreams
Still like waters flowing
In the ocean shell
Sounds of breezes blowing
In my spirit dwell
Still I see the fieldpath 
Would that I could see
Her whose graceful beauty
Lost is now to me

Charles Swain 18011874


LOVE NOT

Love not love not ye hapless sons of clay
Hopes gayest wreaths are made of earthly flowers 
Things that are made to fade and fall away
When they have blossomed but a few short hours
Love not love not

Love not love not The thing you love may die 
May perish from the gay and gladsome earth
The silent stars the blue and smiling sky
Beam on its grave as once upon its birth
Love not love not

Love not love not The thing you love may change
The rosy lip may cease to smile on you
The kindly beaming eye grow cold and strange
The heart still warmly beat yet not be true
Love not love not

Love not love not O warning vainly said
In present years as in the years gone by
Love flings a halo round the dear ones head
Faultless immortal  till they change or die
Love not love not

Caroline Elizabeth Sarah Norton 18081877


A PLACE IN THY MEMORY

A place in thy memory Dearest
Is all that I claim
To pause and look back when thou hearest
The sound of my name
Another may woo thee nearer
Another may win and wear
I care not though he be dearer
If I am remembered there

Remember me not as a lover
Whose hope was crossed
Whose bosom can never recover
The light it hath lost
As the young bride remembers the mother
She loves though she never may see
As a sister remembers a brother
O Dearest remember me

Could I be thy true lover Dearest
Couldst thou smile on me
I would be the fondest and nearest
That ever loved thee
But a cloud on my pathway is glooming
That never must burst upon thine
And heaven that made thee all blooming
Neer made thee to wither on mine

Remember me then O remember
My calm light love
Though bleak as the blasts of November
My life may prove
That life will though lonely be sweet
If its brightest enjoyment should be
A smile and kind word when we meet
And a place in thy memory

Gerald Griffin 18031840


INCLUSIONS

Oh wilt thou have my hand Dear to lie along in thine
As a little stone in a running stream it seems to lie and pine
Now drop the poor pale hand Dear unfit to plight with thine

Oh wilt thou have my cheek Dear drawn closer to thine own
My cheek is white my check is worn by many a tear run down
Now leave a little space Dear lest it should wet thine own

Oh must thou have my soul Dear commingled with thy soul 
Red grows the cheek and warm the hand the part is in the whole
Nor hands nor cheeks keep separate when soul is joined to soul


Elizabeth Barrett Browning 18061861


MARIANA
Mariana in the moated grange  Measure For Measure

With blackest moss the flowerplots
Were thickly crusted one and all
The rusted nails fell from the knots
That held the pear to the gablewall
The broken sheds looked sad and strange
Unlifted was the clinking latch
Weeded and worn the ancient thatch
Upon the lonely moated grange
She only said My life is dreary
He cometh not she said
She said I am aweary aweary
I would that I were dead

Her tears fell with the dews at even
Her tears fell ere the dews were dried
She could not look on the sweet heaven
Either at morn or eventide
After the flitting of the bats
When thickest dark did trance the sky
She drew her casementcurtain by
And glanced athwart the glooming flats
She only said The night is dreary
He cometh not she said
She said I am aweary aweary
I would that I were dead

Upon the middle of the night
Waking she heard the nightfowl crow
The cock sung out an hour ere light
From the dark fen the oxens low
Came to her without hope of change
In sleep she seemed to walk forlorn
Till cold winds woke the grayeyed morn
About the lonely moated grange
She only said The day is dreary
He cometh not she said
She said I am aweary aweary
I would that I were dead

About a stonecast from the wall
A sluice with blackened waters slept
And oer it many round and small
The clustered marishmosses crept
Hard by a poplar shook alway
All silvergreen with gnarled bark
For leagues no other tree did mark
The level waste the rounding gray
She only said My life is dreary
He cometh not she said
She said I am aweary aweary
I would that I were dead

And ever when the moon was low
And the shrill winds were up and away
In the white curtain to and fro
She saw the gusty shadow sway
But when the moon was very low
And wild winds bound within their cell
The shadow of the poplar fell
Upon her bed across her brow
She only said The night is dreary
He cometh not she said
She said I am aweary aweary
I would that I were dead

All day within the dreamy house
The doors upon their hinges creaked
The blue fly sung in the pane the mouse
Behind the moldering wainscot shrieked
Or from the crevice peered about
Old faces glimmered through the doors
Old footsteps trod the upper floors
Old voices called her from without
She only said My life is dreary
He cometh not she said
She said I am aweary aweary
I would that I were dead

The sparrows chirrup on the roof
The slow clock ticking and the sound
Which to the wooing wind aloof
The poplar made did all confound
Her sense but most she loathed the hour
When the thickmoted sunbeam lay
Athwart the chambers and the day
Was sloping toward his western bower
Then said she I am very dreary
He will not come she said
She wept I am aweary aweary
O God that I were dead

Alfred Tennyson 18091892


ASK ME NO MORE
From The Princess

Ask me no more the moon may draw the sea
The cloud may stoop from heaven and take the shape
With fold to fold of mountain or of cape
But O too fond when have I answered thee
Ask me no more

Ask me no more what answer should I give
I love not hollow cheek or faded eye
Yet O my friend I will not have thee die
Ask me no more lest I should bid thee live
Ask me no more

Ask me no more thy fate and mine are sealed
I strove against the stream and all in vain
Let the great river take me to the main
No more dear love for at a touch I yield
Ask me no more

Alfred Tennyson 18091892


A WOMANS LAST WORD

Lets contend no more Love
Strive nor weep
All be as before Love
 Only sleep

What so wild as words are
I and thou
In debate as birds are
Hawk on bough

See the creature stalking
While we speak
Hush and hide the talking
Cheek on cheek

What so false as truth is
False to thee
Where the serpents tooth is
Shun the tree 

Where the apple reddens
Never pry 
Lest we lose our Edens
Eve and I

Be a god and hold me
With a charm
Be a man and fold me
With thine arm

Teach me only teach Love
As I ought
I will speak thy speech Love
Think thy thought 

Meet if thou require it
Both demands
Laying flesh and spirit
In thy hands

That shall be tomorrow
Not tonight
I must bury sorrow
Out of sight

 Must a little weep Love
Foolish me
And so fall asleep Love
Loved by thee

Robert Browning 18121889


THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER

I said  Then dearest since tis so
Since now at length my fate I know
Since nothing all my love avails
Since all my life seemed meant for fails
Since this was written and needs must be 
My whole heart rises up to bless
Your name in pride and thankfulness
Take back the hope you gave  I claim
Only a memory of the same
 And this beside if you will not blame
Your leave for one more last ride with me

My mistress bent that brow of hers
Those deep dark eyes where pride demurs
When pity would be softening through
Fixed me a breathingwhile or two
With life or death in the balance right
The blood replenished me again
My last thought was at least not vain
I and my mistress side by side
Shall be together breathe and ride
So one day more am I deified
Who knows but the world may end tonight

Hush if you saw some western cloud
All billowybosomed overbowed
By many benedictions  suns
And moons and eveningstars at once 
And so you looking and loving best
Conscious grew your passion drew
Cloud sunset moonrise starshine too
Down on you near and yet more near
Till flesh must fade for heaven was here 
Thus leant she and lingeredjoy and fear
Thus lay she a moment on my breast

Then we began to ride My soul
Smoothed itself out a longcramped scroll
Freshening and fluttering in the wind
Past hopes already lay behind
What need to strive with a life awry
Had I said that had I done this
So might I gain so might I miss
Might she have loved me just as well
She might have hated who can tell
Where had I been now if the worst befell
And here we are riding she and I

Fail I alone in words and deeds
Why all men strive and who succeeds
We rode it seemed my spirit flew
Saw other regions cities new
As the world rushed by on either side
I thought  All labor yet no less
Bear up beneath their unsuccess
Look at the end of work contrast
The petty done the undone vast
This present of theirs with the hopeful past
I hoped she would love me here we ride

What hand and brain went ever paired
What heart alike conceived and dared
What act proved all its thought had been
What will but felt the fleshly screen
We ride and I see her bosom heave
Theres many a crown for who can reach
Ten lines a statesmans life in each
The flag stuck on a heap of bones
A soldiers doing what atones
They scratch his name on the Abbeystones
My riding is better by their leave

What does it all mean poet Well
Your brains beat into rhythm you tell
What we felt only you expressed
You hold things beautiful the best
And place them in rhyme so side by side
Tis something nay tis much but then
Have you yourself whats best for men
Are you  poor sick old ere your time 
Nearer one whit your own sublime
Than we who never have turned a rhyme
Sing ridings a joy For me I ride

And you great sculptor  so you gave
A score of years to Art her slave
And thats your Venus whence we turn
To yonder girl that fords the burn
You acquiesce and shall I repine
What man of music you grown gray
With notes and nothing else to say
Is this your sole praise from a friend
Greatly his operas strains intend
But in music we know how fashions end
I gave my youth but we ride in fine

Who knows whats fit for us Had fate
Proposed bliss here should sublimate
My being  had I signed the bond 
Still one must lead some life beyond
Have a bliss to die with dimdescried
This foot once planted on the goal
This glorygarland round my soul
Could I descry such Try and test
I sink back shuddering from the quest
Earth being so good would heaven seem best
Now heaven and she are beyond this ride

And yet  she has not spoke so long
What if heaven be that fair and strong
At lifes best with our eyes upturned
Whither lifes flower is first discerned
We fixed so ever should so abide
What if we still ride on we two
With life forever old yet new
Changed not in kind but in degree
The instant made eternity 
And heaven just prove that I and she
Ride ride together forever ride

Robert Browning 18121889


YOUTH AND ART

It once might have been once only
We lodged in a street together
You a sparrow on the housetop lonely
I a lone shebird of his feather

Your trade was with sticks and clay
You thumbed thrust patted and polished
Then laughed They will see some day
Smith made and Gibson demolished

My business was song song song
I chirped cheeped trilled and twittered
Kate Browns on the boards ere long
And Grisis existence embittered

I earned no more by a warble
Than you by a sketch in plaster
You wanted a piece of marble
I needed a musicmaster

We studied hard in our styles
Chipped each at a crust like Hindoos
For air looked out on the tiles
For fun watched each others windows

You lounged like a boy of the South
Cap and blouse  nay a bit of beard too
Or you got it rubbing your mouth
With fingers the clay adhered to

And I  soon managed to find
Weak points in the flowerfence facing
Was forced to put up a blind
And be safe in my corsetlacing

No harm It was not my fault
If you never turned your eyes tail up
As I shook upon E in alt
Or ran the chromatic scale up

For spring bade the sparrows pair
And the boys and girls gave guesses
And stalls in our street looked rare
With bulrush and watercresses

Why did not you pinch a flower
In a pellet of clay and fling it
Why did not I put a power
Of thanks in a look or sing it

I did look sharp as a lynx
And yet the memory rankles
When models arrived some minx
Tripped upstairs she and her ankles

But I think I gave you as good
That foreign fellow  who can know
How she pays in a playful mood
For his tuning her that piano

Could you say so and never say
Suppose we join hands and fortunes
And I fetch her from over the way
Her piano and long tunes and short tunes

No no you would not be rash
Nor I rasher and something over
Youve to settle yet Gibsons hash
And Grisi yet lives in clover

But you meet the Prince at the Board
Im queen myself at balspare
Ive married a rich old lord
And youre dubbed knight and an R A

Each life unfulfilled you see
It hangs still patchy and scrappy
We have not sighed deep laughed free
Starved feasted despaired  been happy

And nobody calls you a dunce
And people suppose me clever
This could but have happened once
And we missed it lost it forever

Robert Browning 18121889


TWO IN THE CAMPAGNA

I wonder do you feel today
As I have felt since hand in hand
We sat down on the grass to stray
In spirit better through the land
This morn of Rome and May

For me I touched a thought I know
Has tantalized me many times
Like turns of thread the spiders throw
Mocking across our path for rhymes
To catch at and let go

Help me to hold it First it left
The yellowing fennel run to seed
There branching from the brickworks cleft
Some old tombs ruin yonder weed
Took up the floating weft

Where one small orange cup amassed
Five beetles  blind and green they grope
Among the honeymeal and last
Everywhere on the grassy slope
I traced it Hold it fast

The champaign with its endless fleece
Of feathery grasses everywhere
Silence and passion joy and peace
And everlasting wash of air 
Romes ghost since her decease

Such life here through such lengths of hours
Such miracles performed in play
Such primal naked forms of flowers
Such letting Nature have her way
While Heaven looks from its towers

How say you Let us O my dove
Let us be unashamed of soul
As earth lies bare to heaven above
How is it under our control
To love or not to love

I would that you were all to me
You that are just so much no more
Nor yours nor mine  nor slave nor free
Where does the fault lie What the core
Of the wound since wound must be

I would I could adopt your will
See with your eyes and set my heart
Beating by yours and drink my fill
At your souls springs  your part my part
In life for good and ill

No I yearn upward touch you close
Then stand away I kiss your cheek
Catch your souls warmth  I pluck the rose
And love it more than tongue can speak 
Then the good minute goes

Already how am I so far
Out of that minute Must I go
Still like the thistleball no bar
Onward whenever light winds blow
Fixed by no friendly star

Just when I seemed about to learn
Where is the thread now Off again
The old trick Only I discern 
Infinite passion and the pain
Of finite hearts that yearn

Robert Browning 18121889


ONE WAY OF LOVE

All June I bound the rose in sheaves
Now rose by rose I strip the leaves
And strew them where Pauline may pass
She will not turn aside Alas
Let them lie Suppose they die
The chance was they might take her eye

How many a month I strove to suit
These stubborn fingers to the lute
Today I venture all I know
She will not hear my music So
Break the string fold musics wing
Suppose Pauline had bade me sing

My whole life long I learned to love
This hour my utmost art I prove
And speak my passion  heaven or hell
She will not give me heaven Tis well
Lose who may  I still can say
Those who win heaven blest are they

Robert Browning 18121889


NEVER THE TIME AND THE PLACE

Never the time and the place
And the loved one all together
This path  how soft to pace
This May  what magic weather
Where is the loved ones face
In a dream that loved ones face meets mine
But the house is narrow the place is bleak
Where outside rain and wind combine
With a furtive ear if I strive to speak
With a hostile eye at my flushing cheek
With a malice that marks each word each sign
O enemy sly and serpentine
Uncoil thee from the waking man
Do I hold the Past
Thus firm and fast
Yet doubt if the Future hold I can
This path so soft to pace shall lead
Through the magic of May to herself indeed
Or narrow if needs the house must be
Outside are the storms and strangers we 
Oh close safe warm sleep I and she
 I and she

Robert Browning 18121889


SONG
From The Saints Tragedy

Oh that we two were Maying
Down the stream of the soft spring breeze
Like children with violets playing
In the shade of the whispering trees

Oh that we two sat dreaming
On the sward of some sheeptrimmed down
Watching the white mist steaming
Over river and mead and town

Oh that we two lay sleeping
In our nest in the churchyard sod
With our limbs at rest on the quiet earths breast
And our souls at home with God

Charles Kingsley 18191875


FOR HE HAD GREAT POSSESSIONS

Ah marvel not if when I come to die
And follow Death the way my fancies went
Year after fading year the last mad sky
Finds me impenitent
For though my heart went doubting through the night
With many a backward glance at heavens face
Yet found I many treasures of delight
Within this pleasant place

I shall not grieve because the girls were fair
And kinder than the world nor shall I weep
Because with crying lips and clinging hair
They stole away my sleep
For lacking this I might not yet have known
How high the heart could climb or waking seen
The mountains bare their silver breasts of stone
From their chaste robes of green

Though it were all a sin within the mirth
And pain of life I found a song above
Our songs in her who scattered on the earth
Her glad largesse of love
And though she held some dream that was not ours
In some far place that was not for our feet
Where blew across the gladder madder flowers
A wind more bittersweet

Ah who shall hearten when the music stops
For joy of silence While they dreamed above
She showed me love upon the mountain tops
And in the valleys love
And while the wise found heaven with their charts
And lore of souls she made an earth for me
More sweet than all and from our beating hearts
She called the pulsing sea

So marvel not if in the days when death
Shall make my body mine I do not cry
For hours and treasure lost but with my breath
Praise my mortality
For lo this place is fair and losing all
That I have won and dreamed beneath her kiss
I would not see the light of morning fall
On any world but this

Richard Middleton 18821911


WINDLESTRAWS

She kissed me on the forehead
She spoke not any word
The silence flowed between us
And I nor spoke nor stirred

So hopeless for my sake it was
So full of ruth so sweet
My whole heart rose and blessed her
 Then died before her feet

Edward Dowden 18431913


JESSIE

When Jessie comes with her soft breast
And yields the golden keys
Then is it as if God caressed
Twin babes upon His knees 
Twin babes that each to other pressed
Just feel the Fathers arms wherewith they both are blessed

But when I think if we must part
And all this personal dream be fled 
O then my heart O then my useless heart
Would God that thou wert dead 
A clod insensible to joys and ills 
A stone remote in some bleak gully of the hills

Thomas Edward Brown 18301897


THE CHESSBOARD

My little love do you remember
Ere we were grown so sadly wise
Those evenings in the bleak December
Curtained warm from the snowy weather
When you and I played chess together
Checkmated by each others eyes

Ah still I see your soft white hand
Hovering warm oer Queen and Knight
Brave Pawns in valiant battle stand
The double Castles guard the wings
The Bishop bent on distant things
Moves sliding through the fight

Our fingers touch our glances meet
And falter falls your golden hair
Against my cheek your bosom sweet
Is heaving Down the field your Queen
Rides slow her soldiery all between
And checks me unaware

Ah me the little battles done
Dispersed is all its chivalry
Full many a move since then have we
Mid Lifes perplexing chequers made
And many a game with Fortune played 
What is it we have won
This this at least  if this alone

That never never never more
As in those old still nights of yore
Ere we were grown so sadly wise
Can you and I shut out the skies
Shut out the world and wintry weather
And eyes exchanging warmth with eyes
Play chess as then we played together

Edward Robert Bulwer Lytton 18311891


AUX ITALIENS

At Paris it was at the Opera there 
And she looked like a queen in a book that night
With the wreath of pearl in her raven hair
And the brooch on her breast so bright

Of all the operas that Verdi wrote
The best to my taste is the Trovatore
And Mario can soothe with a tenor note
The souls in Purgatory

The moon on the tower slept soft as snow
And who was not thrilled in the strangest way
As we heard him sing while the gas burned low
Non ti scordar di me

The Emperor there in his box of state
Looked grave as if he had just then seen
The red flag wave from the citygate
Where his eagles in bronze had been

The Empress too had a tear in her eye
Youd have said that her fancy had gone back again
For one moment under the old blue sky
To the old glad life in Spain

Well there in our frontrow box we sat
Together my bridebetrothed and I
My gaze was fixed on my operahat
And hers on the stage hard by

And both were silent and both were sad
Like a queen she leaned on her full white arm
With that regal indolent air she had
So confident of her charm

I have not a doubt she was thinking then
Of her former lord good soul that he was
Who died the richest and roundest of men
The Marquis of Carabas

I hope that to get to the kingdom of heaven
Through a needles eye he had not to pass
I wish him well for the jointure given
To my lady of Carabas

Meanwhile I was thinking of my first love
As I had not been thinking of aught for years
Till over my eyes there began to move
Something that felt like tears

I thought of the dress that she wore last time
When we stood neath the cypresstrees together
In that lost land in that soft clime
In the crimson evening weather

Of that muslin dress for the eve was hot
And her warm white neck in its golden chain
And her full soft hair just tied in a knot
And falling loose again

And the jasmineflower in her fair young breast
O the faint sweet smell of that jasmineflower
And the one bird singing alone to his nest
And the one star over the tower

I thought of our little quarrels and strife
And the letter that brought me back my ring
And it all seemed then in the waste of life
Such a very little thing

For I thought of her grave below the hill
Which the sentinel cypresstree stands over
And I thought    were she only living still
How I could forgive her and love her

And I swear as I thought of her thus in that hour
And of how after all old things were best
That I smelt the smell of that jasmineflower
Which she used to wear in her breast

It smelt so faint and it smelt so sweet
It made me creep and it made me cold
Like the scent that steals from the crumbling sheet
Where a mummy is half unrolled

And I turned and looked She was sitting there
In a dim box over the stage and dressed
In that muslin dress with that full soft hair
And that jasmine in her breast

I was here and she was there
And the glittering horseshoe curved between 
From my bridebetrothed with her raven hair
And her sumptuous scornful mien

To my early love with her eyes downcast
And over her primrose face the shade
In short from the Future back to the Past
There was but a step to be made

To my early love from my future bride
One moment I looked Then I stole to the door
I traversed the passage and down at her side
I was sitting a moment more

My thinking of her or the musics strain
Or something which never will be expressed
Had brought her back from the grave again
With the jasmine in her breast

She is not dead and she is not wed
But she loves me now and she loved me then
And the very first word that her sweet lips said
My heart grew youthful again

The Marchioness there of Carabas
She is wealthy and young and handsome still
And but for her    well well let that pass
She may marry whomever she will

But I will marry my own first love
With her primrose face for old things are best
And the flower in her bosom I prize it above
The brooch in my ladys breast

The world is filled with folly and sin
And Love must cling where it can I say
For Beauty is easy enough to win
But one isnt loved every day

And I think in the lives of most women and men
Theres a moment when all would go smooth and even
If only the dead could find out when
To come back and be forgiven

But O the smell of that jasmineflower
And O that music and O the way
That voice rang out from the donjon tower
Non ti scordar di me
Non ti scordar di me

Edward Robert Bulwer Lytton 18311891


SONG

I saw the days white rapture
Die in the sunsets flame
But all her shining beauty
Lives like a deathless name

Our lamps of joy are wasted
Gone is Loves hallowed light
But you and I remember
Through every starlit night

Charles Hanson Towne 1877


THE LONELY ROAD

I think thou waitest Love beyond the Gate 
Eager with windstirred ripples in thy hair
I have not found thee and the hour is late
And harsh the weight I bear

Far have I sought and flung my wealth of years
Like a young traveler gay at careless inns 
See how the winestain whitens neath the tears
My burden wins

And wilt thou know me Love with bended back
Or wilt thou scorn me in so drear a guise
I have a wealth of sorrows in my pack
One lonely prize 

Thy dream  and dross of sin    O dim the fields 
I may not find thee in so dark a land 
Yet I await what hope the turning yields
And beg with empty hand

Kenneth Rand 1891


EVENSONG

Beauty calls and gives no warning
Shadows rise and wander on the day
In the twilight in the quiet evening
We shall rise and smile and go away
Over the flaming leaves
Freezes the sky
It is the season grieves
Not you not I
All our springtimes all our summers
We have kept the longing warm within
Now we leave the aftercomers
To attain the dreams we did not win
Oh we have wakened Sweet and had our birth
And thats the end of earth
And we have toiled and smiled and kept the light
And thats the end of night

Ridgely Torrence 1875


THE NYMPHS SONG TO HYLAS
From The Life and Death of Jason

I know a little gardenclose
Set thick with lily and red rose
Where I would wander if I might
From dewy dawn to dewy night
And have one with me wandering

And though within it no birds sing
And though no pillared house is there
And though the apple boughs are bare
Of fruit and blossom would to God
Her feet upon the green grass trod
And I beheld them as before

There comes a murmur from the shore
And in the close two fair streams are
Drawn from the purple hills afar
Drawn down unto the restless sea
Dark hills whose heathbloom feeds no bee
Dark shore no ship has ever seen
Tormented by the billows green
Whose murmur comes unceasingly
Unto the place for which I cry

For which I cry both day and night
For which I let slip all delight
Whereby I grow both deaf and blind
Careless to win unskilled to find
And quick to lose what all men seek

Yet tottering as I am and weak
Still have I left a little breath
To seek within the jaws of death
An entrance to that happy place
To seek the unforgotten face
Once seen once kissed once reft from me
Anigh the murmuring of the sea

William Morris 18341896


NO AND YES

If I could choose my paradise
And please myself with choice of bliss
Then I would have your soft blue eyes
And rosy little mouth to kiss
Your lips as smooth and tender child
As roseleaves in a coppice wild

If fate bade choose some sweet unrest
To weave my troubled life a snare
Then I would say her maiden breast
And golden ripple of her hair
And weep amid those tresses child
Contented to be thus beguiled

Thomas Ashe 18361889


LOVE IN DREAMS

Love hath his poppywreath
Not Night alone
I laid my head beneath
Loves lilied throne
Then to my sleep he brought
This anodyne 
The flower of many a thought
And fancy fine
A form a face no more
Fairer than truth
A dream from deaths pale shore
The soul of youth
A dream so dear so deep
All dreams above
That still I pray to sleep 
Bring Love back Love

John Addington Symonds 18401893


A LITTLE WHILE I FAIN WOULD LINGER YET

A little while my life is almost set
I fain would pause along the downward way
Musing an hour in this sad sunsetray
While Sweet our eyes with tender tears are wet
A little hour I fain would linger yet

A little while I fain would linger yet
All for loves sake for love that cannot tire
Though fervid youth be dead with youths desire
And hope has faded to a vague regret
A little while I fain would linger yet

A little while I fain would linger here
Behold who knows what strange mysterious bars
Twixt souls that love may rise in other stars
Nor can love deem the face of death is fair
A little while I still would linger here

A little while I yearn to hold thee fast
Hand locked in hand and loyal heart to heart
O pitying Christ those woeful words We part
So ere the darkness fall the light be past
A little while I fain would hold thee fast

A little while when light and twilight meet 
Behind our broken years before the deep
Weird wonder of the last unfathomed sleep 
A little while I still would clasp thee Sweet
A little while when night and twilight meet

A little while I fain would linger here
Behold who knows what souldividing bars
Earths faithful loves may part in other stars
Nor can love deem the face of death is fair
A little while I still would linger here

Paul Hamilton Hayne 18301886


SONG

I made another garden yea
For my new Love
I left the dead rose where it lay
And set the new above
Why did my Summer not begin
Why did my heart not haste
My old Love came and walked therein
And laid the garden waste

She entered with her weary smile
Just as of old
She looked around a little while
And shivered with the cold
Her passing touch was death to all
Her passing look a blight
She made the white rosepetals fall
And turned the red rose white

Her pale robe clinging to the grass
Seemed like a snake
That bit the grass and ground alas
And a sad trail did make
She went up slowly to the gate
And there just as of yore
She turned back at the last to wait
And say farewell once more

Arthur OShaughnessy 18441881


SONG

Has summer come without the rose
Or left the bird behind
Is the blue changed above thee
O world or am I blind
Will you change every flower that grows
Or only change this spot
Where she who said I love thee
Now says I love thee not

The skies seemed true above thee
The rose true on the tree
The bird seemed true the summer through
But all proved false to me
World is there one good thing in you
Life love or death  or what
Since lips that sang I love thee
Have said I love thee not

I think the suns kiss will scarce fall
Into one flowers gold cup
I think the bird will miss me
And give the summer up
O sweet place desolate in tall
Wild grass have you forgot
How her lips loved to kiss me
Now that they kiss me not

Be false or fair above me
Come back with any face
Summer  do I care what you do
You cannot change one place 
The grass the leaves the earth the dew
The grave I make the spot 
Here where she used to love me
Here where she loves me not

Arthur OShaughnessy 18441881


AFTER

A little time for laughter
A little time to sing
A little time to kiss and cling
And no more kissing after

A little while for scheming
Loves unperfected schemes
A little time for golden dreams
Then no more any dreaming

A little while twas given
To me to have thy love
Now like a ghost alone I move
About a ruined heaven

A little time for speaking
Things sweet to say and hear
A time to seek and find thee near
Then no more any seeking

A little time for saying
Words the heart breaks to say
A short sharp time wherein to pray
Then no more need of praying

But long long years to weep in
And comprehend the whole
Great grief that desolates the soul
And eternity to sleep in

Philip Bourke Marston 18501887


AFTER SUMMER

Well not weep for summer over 
No not we
Strew above his head the clover 
Let him be

Other eyes may weep his dying
Shed their tears
There upon him where hes lying
With his peers

Unto some of them he proffered
Gifts most sweet
For our hearts a grave he offered 
Was this meet

All our fond hopes praying perished
In his wrath 
All the lovely dreams we cherished
Strewed his path

Shall we in our tombs I wonder
Far apart
Sundered wide as seas can sunder
Heart from heart

Dream at all of all the sorrows
That were ours 
Bitter nights more bitter morrows
Poisonflowers

Summer gathered as in madness
Saying See
These are yours in place of gladness 
Gifts from me

Nay the rest that will be ours
Is supreme 
And below the poppy flowers
Steals no dream

Philip Bourke Marston 18501887


ROCOCO

Take hand and part with laughter
Touch lips and part with tears
Once more and no more after
Whatever comes with years
We twain shall not remeasure
The ways that left us twain
Nor crush the lees of pleasure
From sanguine grapes of pain

We twain once well in sunder
What will the mad gods do
For hate with me I wonder
Or what for love with you
Forget them till November
And dream theres April yet
Forget that I remember
And dream that I forget

Time found our tired love sleeping
And kissed away his breath
But what should we do weeping
Though light love sleep to death
We have drained his lips at leisure
Till theres not left to drain
A single sob of pleasure
A single pulse of pain

Dream that the lips once breathless
Might quicken if they would
Say that the soul is deathless
Dream that the gods are good
Say March may wed September
And time divorce regret
But not that you remember
And not that I forget

We have heard from hidden places
What love scarce lives and hears
We have seen on fervent faces
The pallor of strange tears
We have trod the winevats treasure
Whence ripe to steam and stain
Foams round the feet of pleasure
The bloodred must of pain

Remembrance may recover
And time bring back to time
The name of your first lover
The ring of my first rhyme
But roseleaves of December
The frosts of June shall fret
The day that you remember
The day that I forget

The snake that hides and hisses
In heaven we twain have known
The grief of cruel kisses
The joy whose mouth makes moan
The pulses pause and measure
Where in one furtive vein
Throbs through the heart of pleasure
The purpler blood of pain

We have done with tears and treasons
And love for treasons sake
Room for the swift new seasons
The years that burn and break
Dismantle and dismember
Mens days and dreams Juliette
For love may not remember
But time will not forget

Life treads down love in flying
Time withers him at root
Bring all dead things and dying
Reaped sheaf and ruined fruit
Where crushed by three days pressure
Our three days love lies slain
And earlier leaf of pleasure
And latter flower of pain

Breathe close upon the ashes
It may be flame will leap
Unclose the soft close lashes
Lift up the lids and weep
Light loves extinguished ember
Let one tear leave it wet
For one that you remember
And ten that you forget

Algernon Charles Swinburne 18371909


RONDEL

These many years since we began to be
What have the Gods done with us what with me
What with my love They have shown me fates and fears
Harsh springs and fountains bitterer than the sea
Grief a fixed star and joy a vane that veers
These many years

With her my Love  with her have they done well
But who shall answer for her who shall tell
Sweet things or sad such things as no man hears
May no tears fall if no tears ever fell
From eyes more dear to me than starriest spheres
These many years

But if tears ever touched for any grief
Those eyelids folded like a whiterose leaf
Deep double shells where through the eyeflower peers
Let them weep once more only sweet and brief
Brief tears and bright for one who gave her tears
These many years

Algernon Charles Swinburne 18371909


THE OBLATION

Ask nothing more of me sweet
All I can give you I give
Heart of my heart were it more
More would be laid at your feet
Love that should help you to live
Song that should spur you to soar

All things were nothing to give
Once to have sense of you more
Touch you and taste of you sweet
Think you and breathe you and live
Swept of your wings as they soar
Trodden by chance of your feet

I that have love and no more
Give you but love of you sweet
He that hath more let him give
He that hath wings let him soar
Mine is the heart at your feet
Here that must love you to live

Algernon Charles Swinburne 18371909


THE SONG OF THE BOWER
From The House of Life

Say is it day is it dusk in thy bower
Thou whom I long for who longest for me
Oh be it light be it night tis Loves hour
Loves that is fettered as Loves that is free
Free Love has leaped to that innermost chamber
Oh the last time and the hundred before
Fettered Love motionless can but remember
Yet something that sighs from him passes the door

Nay but my heart when it flies to thy bower
What does it find there that knows it again
There it must droop like a showerbeaten flower
Red at the rent core and dark with the rain
Ah yet what shelter is still shed above it 
What waters still image its leaves torn apart
Thy soul is the shade that clings round it to love it
And tears are its mirror deep down in thy heart

What were my prize could I enter thy bower
This day tomorrow at eve or at morn
Large lovely arms and a neck like a tower
Bosom then heaving that now lies forlorn
Kindled with lovebreath the suns kiss is colder
Thy sweetness all near me so distant today
My hand round thy neck and thy hand on my shoulder
My mouth to thy mouth as the world melts away

What is it keeps me afar from thy bower 
My spirit my body so fain to be there
Waters engulfing or fires that devour 
Earth heaped against me or death in the air
Nay but in daydreams for terror for pity
The trees wave their heads with an omen to tell
Nay but in nightdreams throughout the dark city
The hours clashed together lose count in the bell

Shall I not one day remember thy bower
One day when all days are one day to me 
Thinking I stirred not and yet had the power
Yearning Ah God if again it might be
Peace peace such a small lamp illumes on this highway
So dimly so few steps in front of my feet 
Yet shows me that her way is parted from my way   
Out of sight beyond light at what goal may we meet

Dante Gabriel Rossetti 18281882


SONG

We break the glass whose sacred wine
To some beloved health we drain
Lest future pledges less divine
Should eer the hallowed toy profane
And thus I broke a heart that poured
Its tide of feelings out for thee
In draughts by aftertimes deplored
Yet dear to memory

But still the old impassioned ways
And habits of my mind remain
And still unhappy light displays
Thine image chambered in my brain
And still it looks as when the hours
Went by like flights of singing birds
Or that soft chain of spoken flowers
And airy gems  thy words

Edward Coote Pinkney 18021828


MAUD MULLER

Maud Muller on a summers day
Raked the meadow sweet with hay

Beneath her torn hat glowed the wealth
Of simple beauty and rustic health

Singing she wrought and her merry glee
The mockbird echoed from his tree

But when she glanced to the faroff town
White from its hillslope looking down

The sweet song died and a vague unrest
And a nameless longing filled her breast 

A wish that she hardly dared to own
For something better than she had known

The Judge rode slowly down the lane
Smoothing his horses chestnut mane

He drew his bridle in the shade
Of the appletrees to greet the maid

And asked a draught from the spring that flowed
Through the meadow across the road

She stooped where the cool spring bubbled up
And filled for him her small tin cup

And blushed as she gave it looking down
On her feet so bare and her tattered gown

Thanks said the Judge a sweeter draught
From a fairer hand was never quaffed

He spoke of the grass and flowers and trees
Of the singing birds and the humming bees

Then talked of the haying and wondered whether
The cloud in the west would bring foul weather

And Maud forgot her briertorn gown
And her graceful ankles bare and brown

And listened while a pleased surprise
Looked from her longlashed hazel eyes

At last like one who for delay
Seeks a vain excuse he rode away

Maud Muller looked and sighed Ah me
That I the Judges bride might be

He would dress me up in silks so fine
And praise and toast me at his wine

My father should wear a broadcloth coat
My brother should sail a painted boat

Id dress my mother so grand and gay
And the baby should have a new toy each day

And Id feed the hungry and clothe the poor
And all should bless me who left our door

The Judge looked back as he climbed the hill
And saw Maud Muller standing still

A form more fair a face more sweet
Neer hath it been my lot to meet

And her modest answer and graceful air
Show her wise and good as she is fair

Would she were mine and I today
Like her a harvester of hay

No doubtful balance of rights and wrongs
Nor weary lawyers with endless tongues

But low of cattle and song of birds
And health and quiet and loving words

But he thought of his sisters proud and cold
And his mother vain of her rank and gold

So closing his heart the Judge rode on
And Maud was left in the field alone

But the lawyers smiled that afternoon
When he hummed in court an old lovetune

And the young girl mused beside the well
Till the rain on the unraked clover fell

He wedded a wife of richest dower
Who lived for fashion as he for power

Yet oft in his marble hearths bright glow
He watched a picture come and go

And sweet Maud Mullers hazel eyes
Looked out in their innocent surprise

Oft when the wine in his glass was red
He longed for the wayside well instead

And closed his eyes on his garnished rooms
To dream of meadows and cloverblooms

And the proud man sighed with a secret pain
Ah that I were free again

Free as when I rode that day
Where the barefoot maiden raked her hay

She wedded a man unlearned and poor
And many children played round her door

But care and sorrow and childbirth pain
Left their traces on heart and brain

And oft when the summer sun shone hot
On the newmown hay in the meadow lot

And she heard the little spring brook fall
Over the roadside through the wall

In the shade of the appletree again
She saw a rider draw his rein

And gazing down with timid grace
She felt his pleased eyes read her face

Sometimes her narrow kitchen walls
Stretched away into stately halls

The weary wheel to a spinet turned
The tallow candle an astral burned

And for him who sat by the chimney lug
Dozing and grumbling oer pipe and mug

A manly form at her side she saw
And joy was duty and love was law

Then she took up her burden of life again
Saying only It might have been

Alas for maiden alas for Judge
For rich repiner and household drudge

God pity them both and pity us all
Who vainly the dreams of youth recall

For all sad words of tongue or pen
The saddest are these It might have been

Ah well for us all some sweet hope lies
Deeply buried from human eyes

And in the hereafter angels may
Roll the stone from its grave away

John Greenleaf Whittier 18071892


LA GRISETTE

Ah Clemence when I saw thee last
Trip down the Rue de Seine
And turning when thy form had passed
I said We meet again 
I dreamed not in that idle glance
Thy latest image came
And only left to memorys trance
A shadow and a name

The few strange words my lips had taught
Thy timid voice to speak
Their gentler signs which often brought
Fresh roses to thy cheek
The trailing of thy long loose hair
Bent oer my couch of pain
All all returned more sweet more fair
Oh had we met again

I walked where saint and virgin keep
The vigil lights of Heaven
I knew that thou hadst woes to weep
And sins to be forgiven
I watched where Genevieve was laid
I knelt by Marys shrine
Beside me low soft voices prayed
Alas but where was thine

And when the morning sun was bright
When wind and wave were calm
And flamed in thousandtinted light
The rose of Notre Dame
I wandered through the haunts of men
From Boulevard to Quai
Till frowning oer Saint Etienne
The Pantheons shadow lay

In vain in vain we meet no more
Nor dream what fates befall
And long upon the strangers shore
My voice on thee may call
When years have clothed the line in moss
That tells thy name and days
And withered on thy simple cross
The wreaths of PerelaChaise

Oliver Wendell Holmes 18091894


THE DARK MAN

Rose o the World she came to my bed
And changed the dreams of my heart and head
For joy of mine she left grief of hers
And garlanded me with a crown of furze

Rose o the World they go out and in
And watch me dream and my mother spin
And they pity the tears on my sleeping face
While my souls away in a fairy place

Rose o the World they have words galore
And wides the swing of my mothers door
And soft they speak of my darkened eyes 
But what do they know who are all so wise

Rose o the World the pain you give
Is worth all days that a man may live 
Worth all shy prayers that the colleens say
On the night that darkens the weddingday

Rose o the World what man would wed
When he might dream of your face instead
Might go to the grave with the blessed pain
Of hungering after your face again

Rose o the World they may talk their fill
For dreams are good and my life stands still
While their lives red ashes the gossips stir
But my fiddle knows  and I talk to her

Nora Hopper 18711906


EURYDICE

He came to call me back from death
To the bright world above
I hear him yet with trembling breath
Low calling O sweet love
Come back The earth is just as fair
The flowers the open skies are there
Come back to life and love

Oh all my heart went out to him
And the sweet air above
With happy tears my eyes were dim
I called him O sweet love
I come for thou art all to me
Go forth and I will follow thee
Right back to life and love

I followed through the cavern black
I saw the blue above
Some terror turned me to look back
I heard him wail O love
What hast thou done What hast thou done
And then I saw no more the sun
And lost were life and love

Francis William Bourdillon 18521921


A WOMANS THOUGHT

I am a woman  therefore I may not
Call to him cry to him
Fly to him
Bid him delay not

Then when he comes to me I must sit quiet
Still as a stone 
All silent and cold
If my heart riot 
Crush and defy it
Should I grow bold
Say one dear thing to him
All my life fling to him
Cling to him 
What to atone
Is enough for my sinning
This were the cost to me
This were my winning 
That he were lost to me

Not as a lover
At last if he part from me
Tearing my heart from me
Hurt beyond cure 
Calm and demure
Then must I hold me
In myself fold me
Lest he discover
Showing no sign to him
By look of mine to him
What he has been to me 
How my heart turns to him
Follows him yearns to him
Prays him to love me

Pity me lean to me
Thou God above me

Richard Watson Gilder 18441900


LAUS VENERIS
A Picture By BurneJones

Pallid with too much longing
White with passion and prayer
Goddess of love and beauty
She sits in the picture there 

Sits with her dark eyes seeking
Something more subtle still
Than the old delights of loving
Her measureless days to fill

She has loved and been loved so often
In her long immortal years
That she tires of the wornout rapture
Sickens of hopes and fears

No joys or sorrows move her
Done with her ancient pride
For her head she found too heavy
The crown she has cast aside

Clothed in her scarlet splendor
Bright with her glory of hair
Sad that she is not mortal 
Eternally sad and fair

Longing for joys she knows not
Athirst with a vain desire
There she sits in the picture
Daughter of foam and fire

Louise Chandler Moulton 18351908


ADONAIS

Shall we meet no more my love at the binding of the sheaves
In the happy harvestfields as the sun sinks low
When the orchard paths are dim with the drift of fallen leaves
And the reapers sing together in the mellow misty eves
O happy are the apples when the south winds blow

Love met us in the orchard ere the corn had gathered plume 
O happy are the apples when the south winds blow
Sweet as summer days that die when the months are in the bloom
And the peaks are ripe with sunset like the tassels of the broom
In the happy harvestfields as the sun sinks low

Sweet as summer days that die leafing sweeter each to each 
O happy are the apples when the south winds blow
All the heart was full of feeling love had ripened into speech
Like the sap that turns to nectar in the velvet of the peach
In the happy harvestfields as the sun sinks low

Sweet as summer days that die at the ripening of the corn 
O happy are the apples when the south winds blow
Sweet as lovers fickle oaths sworn to faithless maids forsworn
When the musty orchard breathes like a mellow drinkinghorn
Over happy harvestfields as the sun sinks low

Love left us at the dying of the mellow autumn eves 
O happy are the apples when the south winds blow
When the skies are ripe and fading like the colors of the leaves
And the reapers kiss and part at the binding of the sheaves
In the happy harvestfields as the sun sinks low

Then the reapers gather home from the gray and misty meres 
O happy are the apples when the south winds blow
Then the reapers gather home and they bear upon their spears
One whose face is like the moon fallen gray among the spheres
With the daylights curse upon it as the sun sinks low

Faint as faroff bugles blowing soft and low the reapers sung 
O happy are the apples when the south winds blow
Sweet as summer in the blood when the heart is ripe and young
Love is sweetest in the dying like the sheaves he lies among
In the happy harvestfields as the sun sinks low

William Wallace Harney 18311912


FACE TO FACE

If my face could only promise that its color would remain
If my heart were only certain it would hide the moments pain
I would meet you and would greet you in the old familiar tone
And naught should ever show you the wrong that you have done

If my trembling hand were steady if my smiles had not all fled
If my eyes spoke not so plainly of the tears they often shed
I would meet you and would greet you at the old trysting place
And perchance youd deem me happy if you met me face to face

If the melody of Springtime awoke no wild refrain
If the Autumns gold burthen awoke no living pain
I would meet you and would greet you as years ago we met
Before our hearts were shipwrecked on the ocean of regret

If my womans soul were stronger if my heart were not so true
I should long have ceased remembering the love I had for you
But I dare not meet or greet you in the old familiar way
Until we meet in Heaven where all tears have passed away

Frances Cochrane 18 


ASHORE

Out I came from the dancingplace
The nightwind met me face to face 

A wind off the harbor cold and keen
I know it whistled where thou hast been

A faint voice fell from the stars above 
Thou whom we lighted to shrines of Love

I found when I reached my lonely room
A faint sweet scent in the unlit gloom

And this was the worst of all to bear
For some one had left white lilac there

The flower you loved in times that were

Laurence Hope 18651904


KHRISTNA AND HIS FLUTE

Be still my heart and listen
For sweet and yet acute
I hear the wistful music
Of Khristna and his flute
Across the cool blue evenings
Throughout the burning days
Persuasive and beguiling
He plays and plays and plays

Ah none may hear such music
Resistant to its charms
The household work grows weary
And cold the husbands arms
I must arise and follow
To seek in vain pursuit
The blueness and the distance
The sweetness of that flute

In linked and liquid sequence
The plaintive notes dissolve
Divinely tender secrets
That none but he can solve
O Khristna I am coming
I can no more delay
My heart has flown to join thee
How shall my footsteps stay

Beloved such thoughts have peril
The wish is in my mind
That I had fired the jungle
And left no leaf behind 
Burnt all bamboos to ashes
And made their music mute 
To save thee from the magic
Of Khristna and his flute

Laurence Hope 18651904


IMPENITENTIA ULTIMA

Before my light goes out forever if God should give me choice of graces
I would not reck of length of days nor crave for things to be
But cry One day of the great lost days one face of all the faces
Grant me to see and touch once more and nothing more to see

For Lord I was free of all Thy flowers but I chose the worlds sad roses
And that is why my feet are torn and mine eyes are blind with sweat
But at Thy terrible judgment seat when this my tired life closes
I am ready to reap whereof I sowed and pay my righteous debt

But once before the sand is run and the silver thread is broken
Give me a grace and cast aside the veil of dolorous years
Grant me one hour of all mine hours and let me see for a token
Her pure and pitiful eyes shine out and bathe her feet with tears

Her pitiful hands should calm and her hair stream down and blind me
Out of the sight of night and out of the reach of fear
And her eyes should be my light whilst the sun went out behind me
And the viols in her voice be the last sound in mine ear

Before the ruining waters fall and my life be carried under
And Thine anger cleave me through as a child cuts down a flower
I will praise Thee Lord in hell while my limbs are racked asunder
For the last sad sight of her face and the little grace of an hour

Ernest Dowson 18671900


NON SUM QUALIS ERAM BONAE SUB REGNO CYNARAE

Last night ah yesternight betwixt her lips and mine
There fell thy shadow Cynara thy breath was shed
Upon my soul between the kisses and the wine
And I was desolate and sick of an old passion
Yea I was desolate and bowed my head
I have been faithful to thee Cynara in my fashion

All night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat
Nightlong within mine arms in love and sleep she lay
Surely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet
But I was desolate and sick of an old passion
When I awoke and found the dawn was gray
I have been faithful to thee Cynara in my fashion

I have forgot much Cynara gone with the wind
Flung roses roses riotously with the throng
Dancing to put thy pale lost lilies out of mind
But I was desolate and sick of an old passion
Yea all the time because the dance was long
I have been faithful to thee Cynara in my fashion

I cried for madder music and for stronger wine
But when the feast is finished and the lamps expire
Then falls thy shadow Cynara the night is thine
And I am desolate and sick of an old passion
Yea hungry for the lips of my desire
I have been faithful to thee Cynara in my fashion

Ernest Dowson 18671900


QUID NON SPEREMUS AMANTES

Why is there in the least touch of her hands
More grace than other womens lips bestow
If love is but a slave to fleshly bands
Of flesh to flesh wherever love may go

Why choose vain grief and heavyhearted hours
For her lost voice and dear remembered hair
If love may cull his honey from all flowers
And girls grow thick as violets everywhere

Nay She is gone and all things fall apart
Or she is cold and vainly have we prayed
And broken is the summers splendid heart
And hope within a deep dark grave is laid

As man aspires and falls yet a soul springs
Out of his agony of flesh at last
So love that flesh enthralls shall rise on wings
Soulcentered when the rule of flesh is past

Then most High Love or wreathed with myrtle sprays
Or crownless and forlorn nor less a star
Thee may I serve and follow all my days
Whose thorns are sweet as never roses are

Ernest Dowson 18671900


SO SWEET LOVE SEEMED

So sweet love seemed that April morn
When first we kissed beside the thorn
So strangely sweet it was not strange
We thought that love could never change

But I can tell  let truth be told 
That love will change in growing old
Though day by day is naught to see
So delicate his motions be

And in the end twill come to pass
Quite to forget what once he was
Nor even in fancy to recall
The pleasure that was all in all

His little spring that sweet we found
So deep in summer floods is drowned
I wonder bathed in joy complete
How love so young could be so sweet

Robert Bridges 18441930


AN OLD TUNE
After Gerard De Nerval

There is an air for which I would disown
Mozarts Rossinis Webers melodies 
A sweet sad air that languishes and sighs
And keeps its secret charm for me alone

Wheneer I hear that music vague and old
Two hundred years are mist that rolls away
The thirteenth Louis reigns and I behold
A green land golden in the dying day

An old red castle strong with stony towers
And windows gay with manycolored glass
Wide plains and rivers flowing among flowers
That bathe the castle basement as they pass

In antique weed with dark eyes and gold hair
A lady looks forth from her window high
It may be that I knew and found her fair
In some forgotten life long time gone by

Andrew Lang 18441912


REFUGE

Set your face to the sea fond lover 
Cold in darkness the seawinds blow
Waves and clouds and the night will cover
All your passion and all your woe
Sobbing waves and the death within them
Sweet as the lips that once you pressed 
Pray that your hopeless heart may win them
Pray that your weary life may rest

Set your face to the stars fond lover 
Calm and silent and bright and true 
They will pity you they will hover
Softly over the deep for you
Winds of heaven will sigh your dirges
Tears of heaven for you be spent
And sweet for you will the murmuring surges
Pour the wail of their low lament

Set your face to the lonely spaces
Vast and gaunt of the midnight sky
There with the drifting cloud your place is
There with the griefs that cannot die
Love is a mocking fiends derision
Peace a phantom and faith a snare
Make the hope of your heart a vision 
Look to heaven and find it there

William Winter 1836


MIDSUMMER

After the May time and after the June time
Rare with blossoms and perfume sweet
Cometh the round worlds royal noon time
The red midsummer of blazing heat
When the sun like an eye that never closes
Bends on the earth its fervid gaze
And the winds are still and the crimson roses
Droop and wither and die in its rays

Unto my heart has come this season
O my lady my worshiped one
When over the stars of Pride and Reason
Sails Loves cloudless noonday sun
Like a great red ball in my bosom burning
With fires that nothing can quench or tame
It glows till my heart itself seems turning
Into a liquid lake of flame

The hopes half shy and the sighs all tender
The dreams and fears of an earlier day
Under the noontides royal splendor
Droop like roses and wither away
From the hills of Doubt no winds are blowing
From the isles of Pain no breeze is sent 
Only the sun in a white heat glowing
Over an ocean of great content

Sink O my soul in this golden glory
Die O my heart in thy raptureswoon
For the Autumn must come with its mournful story
And Loves midsummer will fade too soon

Ella Wheeler Wilcox 18501919


ASHES OF ROSES

Soft on the sunset sky
Bright daylight closes
Leaving when light doth die
Pale hues that mingling lie 
Ashes of roses

When loves warm sun is set
Loves brightness closes
Eyes with hot tears are wet
In hearts there linger yet
Ashes of roses

Elaine Goodale Eastman 1863


SYMPATHY

The color gladdens all your heart
You call it Heaven dear but I 
Now Hope and I are far apart 
Call it the sky

I know that Natures tears have wet
The world with sympathy but you
Who know not any sorrow yet
Call it the dew

Althea Gyles   


THE LOOK

Strephon kissed me in the spring
Robin in the fall
But Colin only looked at me
And never kissed at all

Strephons kiss was lost in jest
Robins lost in play
But the kiss in Colins eyes
Haunts me night and day

Sara Teasdale 18841933


WHEN MY BELOVED SLEEPING LIES

When my beloved sleeping lies
I cannot look at him for tears
Such mournful peace is on his eyes

A look of lonely death he wears
And graven very calm and deep
Lie all the sorrows of old years

He is so passionless in sleep
With all his strength relaxed to rest
I cannot see him and not weep

For weakness life has not confessed
And shadowed scars of old mistakes
I take his head upon my breast
And hold my dearest till he wakes

Irene Rutherford McLeod 1891


LOVE AND LIFE

Give me a fillet Love quoth I
To bind my Sweetings heart to me
So neer a chance of earth or sky
Shall part us ruthlessly
A fillet Love but not to chafe
My Sweetings soul to cause her pain
But just to bind her close and safe
Through snow and blossom and sun and rain
A fillet boy
Love said Heres joy

Give me a fetter Life quoth I
To bind to mine my Sweetings heart
So Death himself must fail to pry
With Time the two apart
A fetter Life that each shall wear
Whose precious bondage each shall know
I prithee Life no more forbear 
Why dost thou wait and falter so
Haste Life  be brief
Said Life  Heres grief

Julie Mathilde Lippman 1864


LOVES PRISONER

Sweet love has twined his fingers in my hair
And laid his hand across my wondering eyes
I cannot move save in the narrow space
Of his strong arms embrace
Nor see but only in my own heart where
His image lies
How can I tell
Emprisoned so well
If in the outer world be sunset or sunrise
Sweet Love has laid his hand across my eyes

Sweet Love has loosed his fingers from my hair
His lifted hand has left my eyelids wet
I cannot move save to pursue his fleet
And unreturning feet
Nor see but in my ruined heart and there
His face lies yet
How should I know
Distraught and blinded so
If in the outer world be sunrise or sunset
Sweet Love has freed my eyes but they are wet

Mariana Griswold Van Rensselaer 18511934


ROSIES

Theres a rosieshow in Derry
An a rosieshow in Down
An tis like theres wan Im thinkin
ll be held in Randalstown
But if I had the choosin
Av a rosieprize the day
Twould be a pink wee rosie
Like he plucked whin rakin hay
Yon pink wee rosie in my hair 
He fixed it troth  an kissed it there
White gulls wor wheelin roun the sky
Down by  down by

Ay theres rosies sure in Derry
An theres famous wans in Down
Och theres rosies all ahawkin
Through the heart av London town
But if I had the liftin
Or the buyin av a few
Id choose jist pink wee rosies
Thats all drenchin wid the dew 
Yon pink wee rosies wid the tears
Och wet wet tears  ay troth tis years
Since we kep rakin in the hay
Thon day  thon day

Agnes I Hanrahan 18


AT THE COMEDY

Last night in snowy gown and glove
I saw you watch the play
Where each mock hero won his love
In the old unlifelike way

And oh were life their little scene
Where love so smoothly ran
How different Dear this world had been
Since this old world began

For you who saw them gayly win
Both hand and heart away
Knew well where dwelt the mockery in
That foolish little play

If love were all  if love were all
The viols sobbed and cried
Then love were best whateer befall
Low low the flutes replied

And you last night did you forget
So far from me so near
For watching there your eyes were wet
With just an idle tear

And down the great dark curtain fell
Upon their foolish play
But you and I knew  Oh too well 
Life went another way

Arthur Stringer 1874


SOMETIME IT MAY BE

Sometime it may be you and I
In that deserted yard shall lie
Where memories fade away
Caring no more for our old dreams
Busy with new and alien themes
The saints and sages say

But let our graves be side by side
So passersby at eventide
May pause a moments space
Ah they were lovers who lie here
Else why these low graves laid so near
In this forgotten place

Arthur Colton 1868


I HEARD A SOLDIER

I heard a soldier sing some trifle
Out in the sundried veldt alone
He lay and cleaned his grimy rifle
Idly behind a stone

If after death love comes a waking
And in their camp so dark and still
The men of dust hear bugles breaking
Their halt upon the hill

To me the slow and silver pealing
That then the last high trumpet pours
Shall softer than the dawn come stealing
For with its call comes yours

What grief of love had he to stifle
Basking so idly by his stone
That grimy soldier with his rifle
Out in the veldt alone

Herbert Trench 18651923


THE LAST MEMORY

When I am old and think of the old days
And warm my hands before a little blaze
Having forgotten love hope fear desire
I shall see smiling out of the pale fire
One face mysterious and exquisite
And I shall gaze and ponder over it
Wondering was it Leonardo wrought
That stealthy ardency where passionate thought
Burns inward a revealing flame and glows
To the last ecstasy which is repose
Was it Bronzino those Borghese eyes
And musing thus among my memories
O unforgotten you will come to seem
As pictures do remembered some old dream
And I shall think of you as something strange
And beautiful and full of helpless change
Which I beheld and carried in my heart
But you I loved will have become a part
Of the eternal mystery and love
Like a dim pain and I shall bend above
My little fire and shiver being cold
When you are no more young and I am old

Arthur Symons 1865


DOWN BY THE SALLEY GARDENS

Down by the salley gardens my love and I did meet
She passed the salley gardens with little snowwhite feet
She bid me take love easy as the leaves grow on the tree
But I being young and foolish with her would not agree
In a field by the river my love and I did stand
And on my leaning shoulder she laid her snowwhite hand
She bid me take life easy as the grass grows on the weirs
But I was young and foolish and now am full of tears

William Butler Yeats 1865


ASHES OF LIFE

Love has gone and left me and the days are all alike
Eat I must and sleep I will  and would that night were here
But ah to lie awake and hear the slow hours strike
Would that it were day again with twilight near

Love has gone and left me and I dont know what to do
This or that or what you will is all the same to me
But all the things that I begin I leave before Im through 
Theres little use in anything as far as I can see

Love has gone and left me and the neighbors knock and borrow
And life goes on forever like the gnawing of a mouse
And tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Theres this little street and this little house

Edna St Vincent Millay 1892


A FAREWELL

Thou wilt not look on me
Ah well the world is wide
The rivers still are rolling free
Song and the sword abide
And who sets forth to sail the sea
Shall follow with the tide

Thrall of my darkling day
I vassalage fulfil
Seeking the myrtle and the bay
They thrive when hearts are chill
The straitness of the narrowing way
The house where all is still

Alice Brown 1857







THE PARTED LOVERS






SONG
From Twelfth Night

O mistress mine where are you roaming
O stay and hear your true Loves coming
That can sing both high and low
Trip no further pretty Sweeting
Journeys end in lovers meeting
Every wise mans son doth know

What is love tis not hereafter
Present mirth hath present laughter
Whats to come is still unsure
In delay there lies no plenty
Then come kiss me Sweetandtwenty
Youths a stuff will not endure

William Shakespeare 15641616


GO LOVELY ROSE

Go lovely Rose 
Tell her that wastes her time and me
That now she knows
When I resemble her to thee
How sweet and fair she seems to be

Tell her thats young
And shuns to have her graces spied
That hadst thou sprung
In deserts where no men abide
Thou must have uncommended died

Small is the worth
Of beauty from the light retired
Bid her come forth
Suffer herself to be desired
And not blush so to be admired

Then die  that she
The common fate of all things rare
May read in thee
How small a part of time they share
That are so wondrous sweet and fair

Edmund Waller 16061687


TO THE ROSE A SONG

Go happy Rose and interwove
With other flowers bind my love
Tell her too she must not be
Longer flowing longer free
That so oft fettered me

Say if shes fretful I have bands
Of pearl and gold to bind her hands
Tell her if she struggle still
I have myrtle rods at will
For to tame though not to kill

Take thou my blessing thus and go
And tell her this  but do not so 
Lest a handsome anger fly
Like a lightning from her eye
And burn thee up as well as I

Robert Herrick 15911674


MEMORY
From Britannias Pastorals

Marinas gone and now sit I
As Philomela on a thorn
Turned out of natures livery
Mirthless alone and all forlorn
Only she sings not while my sorrows can
Breathe forth such notes as fit a dying swan

So shuts the marigold her leaves
At the departure of the sun
So from the honeysuckle sheaves
The bee goes when the day is done
So sits the turtle when she is but one
And so all woe as I since she is gone

To some few birds kind Nature hath
Made all the summer as one day
Which once enjoyed cold winters wrath
As night they sleeping pass away
Those happy creatures are that know not yet
The pain to be deprived or to forget

I oft have heard men say there be
Some that with confidence profess
The helpful Art of Memory
But could they teach Forgetfulness
Id learn and try what further art could do
To make me love her and forget her too

Sad melancholy that persuades
Men from themselves to think they be
Headless or other bodies shades
Hath long and bootless dwelt with me
For could I think she some idea were
I still might love forget and have her here

But such she is not nor would I
For twice as many torments more
As her bereaved company
Hath brought to those I felt before
For then no future time might hap to know
That she deserved or I did love her so

Ye hours then but as minutes be
Though so I shall be sooner old
Till I those lovely graces see
Which but in her can none behold
Then be an age that we may never try
More grief in parting but grow old and die

William Browne 15911643


TO LUCASTA GOING TO THE WARS

Tell me not Sweet I am unkind
That from the nunnery
Of thy chaste breast and quiet mind
To war and arms I fly

True a new mistress now I chase
The first foe in the field
And with a stronger faith embrace
A sword a horse a shield

Yet this inconstancy is such
As thou too shalt adore
I could not love thee Dear so much
Loved I not Honor more

Richard Lovelace 16181658


TO LUCASTA GOING BEYOND THE SEAS

If to be absent were to be
Away from thee
Or that when I am gone
You or I were alone
Then my Lucasta might I crave
Pity from blustering wind or swallowing wave

But Ill not sigh one blast or gale
To swell my sail
Or pay a tear to suage
The foaming blue gods rage
For whether he will let me pass
Or no Im still as happy as I was

Though seas and land be twixt us both
Our faith and troth
Like separated souls
All time and space controls
Above the highest sphere we meet
Unseen unknown and greet as Angels greet

So then we do anticipate
Our afterfate
And are alive in the skies
If thus our lips and eyes
Can speak like spirits unconfined
In Heaven their earthy bodies left behind

Richard Lovelace 16181658


SONG TO A FAIR YOUNG LADY GOING OUT OF THE TOWN IN THE SPRING

Ask not the cause why sullen Spring
So long delays her flowers to bear
Why warbling birds forget to sing
And winter storms invert the year
Chloris is gone and fate provides
To make it Spring where she resides

Chloris is gone the cruel fair
She cast not back a pitying eye
But left her lover in despair
To sigh to languish and to die
Ah how can those fair eyes endure
To give the wounds they will not cure

Great God of Love why hast thou made
A face that can all hearts command
That all religions can invade
And change the laws of every land
Where thou hadst placed such power before
Thou shouldst have made her mercy more

When Chloris to the temple comes
Adoring crowds before her fall
She can restore the dead from tombs
And every life but mine recall
I only am by Love designed
To be the victim for mankind

John Dryden 16311700


SONG
Written At Sea In The First Dutch War 1665
The Night Before An Engagement

To all you ladies now at land
We men at sea indite
But first would have you understand
How hard it is to write
The Muses now and Neptune too
We must implore to write to you 
With a fa la la la la

For though the Muses should prove kind
And fill our empty brain
Yet if rough Neptune rouse the wind
To wave the azure main
Our paper pen and ink and we
Roll up and down our ships at sea 
With a fa la la la la

Then if we write not by each post
Think not we are unkind
Nor yet conclude our ships are lost
By Dutchmen or by wind
Our tears well send a speedier way
The tide shall bring them twice a day 
With a fa la la la la

The King with wonder and surprise
Will swear the seas grow bold
Because the tides will higher rise
Than eer they did of old
But let him know it is our tears
Bring floods of grief to Whitehall stairs 
With a fa la la la la

Should foggy Opdam chance to know
Our sad and dismal story
The Dutch would scorn so weak a foe
And quit their fort at Goree
For what resistance can they find
From men whove left their hearts behind 
With a fa la la la la

Let wind and weather do its worst
Be you to us but kind
Let Dutchmen vapor Spaniards curse
No sorrow we shall find
Tis then no matter how things go
Or whos our friend or whos our foe 
With a fa la la la la

To pass our tedious hours away
We throw a merry main
Or else at serious ombre play
But why should we in vain
Each others ruin thus pursue
We were undone when we left you 
With a fa la la la la

But now our fears tempestuous grow
And cast our hopes away
Whilst you regardless of our woe
Sit careless at a play
Perhaps permit some happier man
To kiss your hand or flirt your fan 
With a fa la la la la

When any mournful tune you hear
That dies in every note
As if it sighed with each mans care
For being so remote
Think then how often love weve made
To you when all those tunes were played 
With a fa la la la la

In justice you cannot refuse
To think of our distress
When we for hopes of honor lose
Our certain happiness
All those designs are but to prove
Ourselves more worthy of your love 
With a fa la la la la

And now weve told you all our loves
And likewise all our fears
In hopes this declaration moves
Some pity for our tears
Lets hear of no inconstancy 
We have too much of that at sea 
With a fa la la la la

Charles Sackville 16381706


SONG

In vain you tell your parting lover
You wish fair winds may waft him over
Alas what winds can happy prove
That bear me far from what I love
Alas what dangers on the main
Can equal those that I sustain
From slighted vows and cold disdain

Be gentle and in pity choose
To wish the wildest tempests loose
That thrown again upon the coast
Where first my shipwrecked heart was lost
I may once more repeat my pain
Once more in dying notes complain
Of slighted vows and cold disdain

Matthew Prior 16641721


BLACKEYED SUSAN

All in the Downs the fleet was moored
The streamers waving in the wind
When blackeyed Susan came aboard
O where shall I my truelove find
Tell me ye jovial sailors tell me true
If my sweet William sails among the crew

William who high upon the yard
Rocked with the billow to and fro
Soon as her wellknown voice he heard
He sighed and cast his eyes below
The cord slides swiftly through his glowing hands
And quick as lightning on the deck he stands

So the sweet lark high poised in air
Shuts close his pinions to his breast
If chance his mates shrill call he hear
And drops at once into her nest 
The noblest captain in the British fleet
Might envy Williams lip those kisses sweet

O Susan Susan lovely dear
My vows shall ever true remain
Let me kiss off that falling tear
We only part to meet again
Change as ye list ye winds my heart shall be
The faithful compass that still points to thee

Believe not what the landmen say
Who tempt with doubts thy constant mind
Theyll tell thee sailors when away
In every port a mistress find
Yes yes believe them when they tell thee so
For Thou art present wheresoeer I go

If to far Indias coast we sail
Thy eyes are seen in diamonds bright
Thy breath is Africs spicy gale
Thy skin is ivory so white
Thus every beauteous object that I view
Wakes in my soul some charm of lovely Sue

Though battle call me from thy arms
Let not my pretty Susan mourn
Though cannons roar yet safe from harms
William shall to his Dear return
Love turns aside the balls that round me fly
Lest precious tears should drop from Susans eye

The boatswain gave the dreadful word
The sails their swelling bosom spread
No longer must she stay aboard
They kissed she sighed he hung his head
Her lessening boat unwilling rows to land
Adieu she cries and waved her lily hand

John Gay 16851732


IRISH MOLLY O

Oh who is that poor foreigner that lately came to town
And like a ghost that cannot rest still wanders up and down
A poor unhappy Scottish youth  if more you wish to know
His heart is breaking all for love of Irish Molly O

Shes modest mild and beautiful the fairest I have known 
The primrose of Ireland  all blooming here alone 
The primrose of Ireland for wheresoeer I go
The only one entices me is Irish Molly O

When Mollys father heard of it a solemn oath he swore
That if shed wed a foreigner hed never see her more
He sent for young MacDonald and he plainly told him so 
Ill never give to such as you my Irish Molly O

MacDonald heard the heavy news and grievously did say 
Farewell my lovely Molly since Im banished far away
A poor forlorn pilgrim I must wander to and fro
And all for the sake of my Irish Molly O

There is a rose in Ireland I thought it would be mine
But now that she is lost to me I must for ever pine
Till death shall come to comfort me for to the grave Ill go
And all for the sake of my Irish Molly O

And now that I am dying this one request I crave
To place a marble tombstone above my humble grave
And on the stone these simple words Id have engraven so 
MacDonald lost his life for love of Irish Molly O

Unknown


SONG

At setting day and rising morn
Wi soul that still shall love thee
Ill ask o Heaven thy safe return
Wi a that can improve thee
Ill visit aft the birken bush
Where first thou kindly tauld me
Sweet tales o love and hid my blush
Whilst round thou didst infauld me

To a our haunts I will repair
By greenwood shaw or fountain
Or where the summer day Id share
Wi thee upon yon mountain
There will I tell the trees an flooers
From thoughts unfeigned an tender
By vows youre mine by love is yours
A heart that cannot wander

Allan Ramsay 16861758


LOCHABER NO MORE

Farewell to Lochaber an farewell my Jean
Where heartsome wi thee I hae mony day been
For Lochaber no more Lochaber no more
Well maybe return to Lochaber no more
These tears that I shed they are a for my dear
An no for the dangers attending on weir
Though borne on rough seas to a far bloody shore
Maybe to return to Lochaber no more

Though hurricanes rise an rise every wind
Theyll neer mak a tempest like that in my mind
Though loudest o thunders on louder waves roar
Thats naething like leaving my love on the shore
To leave thee behind me my heart is sair pained
By ease thats inglorious no fame can be gained
An beauty an loves the reward o the brave
An I must deserve it before I can crave

Then glory my Jeanie maun plead my excuse
Since honor commands me how can I refuse
Without it I neer can have merit for thee
An without thy favor Id better not be
I gae then my lass to win honor an fame
An if I should luck to come gloriously hame
Ill bring a heart to thee wi love running oer
An then Ill leave thee an Lochaber no more

Allan Ramsay 16861758


WILLIE AND HELEN

Wharefore soud ye talk o love
Unless it be to pain us
Wharefore soud ye talk o love
Whan ye say the sea maun twain us

Its no because my love is light
Nor for your angry deddy
Its a to buy ye pearlins bright
An to busk ye like a leddy

O Willy I can caird an spin
Sae neer can want for cleedin
An gin I hae my Willys heart
I hae a the pearls Im heedin

Will it be time to praise this cheek
Whan years an tears hae blenched it
Will it be time to talk o love
Whan cauld an care hae quenched it

Hes laid ae han about her waist 
The ithers held to heaven
An his luik was like the luik o man
Whas heart in twa is riven

Hew Ainslie 17921878


ABSENCE

With leaden foot Time creeps along
While Delia is away
With her nor plaintive was the song
Nor tedious was the day

Ah envious Power reverse my doom
Now double thy career
Strain every nerve stretch every plume
And rest them when shes here

Richard Jago 17151781


MY MOTHER BIDS ME BIND MY HAIR

My mother bids me bind my hair
With bands of rosy hue
Tie up my sleeves with ribbons rare
And lace my bodice blue

For why she cries sit still and weep
While others dance and play
Alas I scarce can go or creep
While Lubin is away

Tis sad to think the days are gone
When those we love were near
I sit upon this mossy stone
And sigh when none can hear

And while I spin my flaxen thread
And sing my simple lay
The village seems asleep or dead
Now Lubin is away

Anne Hunter 17421821


BLOW HIGH BLOW LOW

Blow high blow low let tempest tear
The mainmast by the board
My heart with thoughts of thee my dear
And love well stored
Shall brave all danger scorn all fear
The roaring wind the raging sea
In hopes on shore
To be once more
Safe moored with thee

Aloft while mountainhigh we go
The whistling winds that scud along
And the surge roaring from below
Shall my signal be
To think on thee
And this shall be my Song
Blow high blow low let tempest tear   

And on that night when all the crew
The memory of their former lives
Oer flowing cans of flip renew
And drink their sweethearts and their wives
Ill heave a sigh
And think of thee
And as the ship toils through the sea
The burden of my Song shall be
Blow high blow low let tempest tear   

Charles Dibdin 17451814


THE SILLER CROUN

And ye sall walk in silk attire
And siller hae to spare
Gin yell consent to be his bride
Nor think o Donald mair

Oh wha wad buy a silken goun
Wi a puir broken heart
Or whats to me a siller croun
Gin frae my luve I part

The mind whas every wish is pure
Far dearer is to me
And ere Im forced to break my faith
Ill lay me doun and dee

For I hae pledged my virgin troth
Brave Donalds fate to share
And he has gien to me his heart
Wi a its virtues rare

His gentle manners wan my heart
He gratefu took the gift
Could I but think to tak it back
It wad be waur than theft

For langest life can neer repay
The love he bears to me
And ere Im forced to break my troth
Ill lay me doun and dee

Susanna Blamire 17471794


MY NANNIES AWA

Now in her green mantle blithe Nature arrays
An listens the lambkins that bleat oer the braes
While birds warble welcome in ilka green shaw
But to me its delightless  my Nannies awa

The snawdrap an primrose our woodlands adorn
An violets bathe in the weet o the morn
They pain my sad bosom sae sweetly they blaw
They mind me o Nannie  an Nannies awa

Thou laverock that springs frae the dews of the lawn
The shepherd to warn o the graybreaking dawn
An thou mellow mavis that hails the nightfa
Give over for pity  my Nannies awa

Come autumn sae pensive in yellow an gray
An soothe me wi tidings o Natures decay
The dark dreary winter an wilddriving snaw
Alane can delight me  now Nannies awa

Robert Burns 17591796


AE FOND KISS

Ae fond kiss and then we sever
Ae fareweel alas for ever
Deep in heartwrung tears Ill pledge thee
Warring sighs and groans Ill wage thee

Who shall say that Fortune grieves him
While the star of Hope she leaves him
Me nae cheerfu twinkle lights me
Dark despair around benights me

Ill neer blame my partial fancy
Naething could resist my Nancy
But to see her was to love her
Love but her and love for ever

Had we never loved sae kindly
Had we never loved sae blindly
Never met or never parted
We had neer been brokenhearted

Fare thee weel thou first and fairest
Fare thee weel thou best and dearest
Thine be ilka joy and treasure
Peace enjoyment love and pleasure

Ae fond kiss and then we sever
Ae fareweel alas for ever
Deep in heartwrung tears Ill pledge thee
Warring sighs and groans Ill wage thee

Robert Burns 17591796


THE DAY RETURNS

The day returns my bosom burns
The blissful day we twa did meet
Though winter wild in tempest toiled
Neer summer sun was half sae sweet
Than a the pride that loads the tide
And crosses oer the sultry line 
Than kingly robes and crowns and globes
Heaven gave me more  it made thee mine

While day and night can bring delight
Or Nature aught of pleasure give 
While joys above my mind can move
For thee and thee alone I live
When that grim foe of life below
Comes in between to make us part
The iron hand that breaks our band
It breaks my bliss  it breaks my heart

Robert Burns 17591796


MY BONNIE MARY

Go fetch to me a pint o wine
And fill it in a silver tassie
That I may drink before I go
A service to my bonnie lassie
The boat rocks at the pier o Leith
Fu loud the wind blaws frae the ferry
The ship rides by the Berwicklaw
And I maun leave my bonnie Mary

The trumpets sound the banners fly
The glittering spears are ranked ready
The shouts o war are heard afar
The battle closes thick and bloody
But its no the roar o sea or shore
Wad mak me langer wish to tarry
Nor shout o war thats heard afar 
Its leaving thee my bonnie Mary

Robert Burns 17591796


A RED RED ROSE

O my luves like a red red rose
Thats newly sprung in June
O my luves like the melodie
Thats sweetly played in tune

As fair thou art my bonnie lass
So deep in luve am I
And I will luve thee still my dear
Till a the seas gang dry

Till a the seas gang dry my dear
And the rocks melt wi the sun
I will luve thee still my dear
While the sands o life shall run

And faretheeweel my only luve
And faretheeweel a while
And I will come again my luve
Though it were ten thousand mile

Robert Burns 17591796


I LOVE MY JEAN

Of a the airts the wind can blaw
I dearly like the west
For there the bonnie lassie lives
The lassie I loe best
Theres wild woods grow and rivers row
And monie a hill between
But day and night my fancys flight
Is ever wi my Jean

I see her in the dewy flowers
I see her sweet and fair
I hear her in the tunefu birds
I hear her charm the air
Theres not a bonnie flower that springs
By fountain shaw or green
Theres not a bonnie bird that sings
But minds me o my Jean

O blaw ye westlin winds blaw saft
Amang the leafy trees
Wi balmy gale frae hill and dale
Bring hame the laden bees
And bring the lassie back to me
Thats aye sae neat and clean
Ae smile o her wad banish care
Sae charming is my Jean

What sighs and vows amang the knowes
Hae passed atween us twa
How fond to meet how wae to part
That night she gaed awa
The Powers aboon can only ken
To whom the heart is seen
That nane can be sae dear to me
As my sweet lovely Jean

THE ROVERS ADIEU
From Rokeby

A weary lot is thine fair maid
A weary lot is thine
To pull the thorn thy brow to braid
And press the rue for wine
A lightsome eye a soldiers mien
A feather of the blue
A doublet of the Lincoln green 
No more of me ye knew
My Love
No more of me ye knew

This morn is merry June I trow
The rose is budding fain
But she shall bloom in winter snow
Ere we two meet again
 He turned his charger as he spake
Upon the river shore
He gave the bridlereins a shake
Said Adieu for evermore
My Love
And adieu for evermore

Walter Scott 17711832


LOUDOUNS BONNIE WOODS AND BRAES

Loudouns bonnie woods and braes
I maun lea them a lassie
Wha can thole when Britains faes
Wad gie Britons law lassie
Wha wad shun the field o danger
Wha frae fame wad live a stranger
Now when freedom bids avenge her
Wha wad shun her ca lassie
Loudouns bonnie woods and braes
Hae seen our happy bridal days
And gentle Hope shall soothe thy waes
When I am far awa lassie

Hark the swelling bugle sings
Yielding joy to thee laddie
But the dolefu bugle brings
Waefu thoughts to me laddie
Lanely I maun climb the mountain
Lanely stray beside the fountain
Still the weary moments countin
Far frae love and thee laddie
Oer the gory fields of war
When Vengeance drives his crimson car
Thoult maybe fa frae me afar
And nane to close thy ee laddie

O resume thy wonted smile
O suppress thy fears lassie
Glorious honor crowns the toil
That the soldier shares lassie
Heaven will shield thy faithful lover
Till the vengeful strife is over
Then well meet nae mair to sever
Till the day we dee lassie
Midst our bonnie woods and braes
Well spend our peaceful happy days
As blithes yon lightsome lamb that plays
On Loudouns flowery lea lassie

Robert Tannahill 17741810


FARE THEE WELL

Fare thee well and if for ever
Still for ever fare thee well
Even though unforgiving never
Gainst thee shall my heart rebel

Would that breast were bared before thee
Where thy head so oft hath lain
While that placid sleep came oer thee
Which thou neer canst know again

Would that breast by thee glanced over
Every inmost thought could show
Then thou wouldst at last discover
Twas not well to spurn it so

Though the world for this commend thee 
Though it smile upon the blow
Even its praises must offend thee
Founded on anothers woe

Though my many faults defaced me
Could no other arm be found
Than the one which once embraced me
To inflict a cureless wound

Yet oh yet thyself deceive not
Love may sink by slow decay
But by sudden wrench believe not
Hearts can thus be torn away

Still thine own its life retaineth 
Still must mine though bleeding beat
And the undying thought which paineth
Is  that we no more may meet

These are words of deeper sorrow
Than the wail above the dead
Both shall live but every morrow
Wake us from a widowed bed

And when thou wouldst solace gather
When our childs first accents flow
Wilt thou teach her to say Father
Though his care she must forego

When her little hands shall press thee
When her lip to thine is pressed
Think of him whose prayer shall bless thee
Think of him thy love had blessed

Should her lineaments resemble
Those thou nevermore mayst see
Then thy heart will softly tremble
With a pulse yet true to me

All my faults perchance thou knowest
All my madness none can know
All my hopes whereer thou goest
Whither yet with thee they go

Every feeling hath been shaken
Pride which not a world could bow
Bows to thee  by thee forsaken
Even my soul forsakes me now

But tis done  all words are idle 
Words from me are vainer still
But the thoughts we cannot bridle
Force their way without the will

Fare thee well  thus disunited
Torn from every nearer tie
Seared in heart and lone and blighted
More than this I scarce can die

George Gordon Byron 17881824


MAID OF ATHENS ERE WE PART

Maid of Athens ere we part
Give oh give me back my heart
Or since that has left my breast
Keep it now and take the rest
Hear my vow before I go
Zoe mou sas agapo My life I love you

By those tresses unconfined
Wooed by each Aegean wind
By those lids whose jetty fringe
Kiss thy soft cheeks blooming tinge
By those wild eyes like the roe
Zoe mou sas agapo My life I love you

By that lip I long to taste
By that zoneencircled waist
By all the tokenflowers that tell
What words can never speak so well
By loves alternate joy and woe
Zoe mou sas agapo My life I love you

Maid of Athens I am gone
Think of me sweet when alone
Though I fly to Istambol
Athens holds my heart and soul
Can I cease to love thee No
Zoe mou sas agapo My life I love you

George Gordon Byron 17881824


WHEN WE TWO PARTED

When we two parted
In silence and tears
Half brokenhearted
To sever for years
Pale grew thy cheek and cold
Colder thy kiss
Truly that hour foretold
Sorrow to this

The dew of the morning
Sunk chill on my brow
It felt like the warning
Of what I feel now
Thy vows are all broken
And light is thy fame
I hear thy name spoken
And share in its shame

They name thee before me
A knell to mine ear
A shudder comes oer me 
Why wert thou so dear
They know not I knew thee
Who knew thee too well
Long long shall I rue thee
Too deeply to tell

In secret we met
In silence I grieve
That thy heart could forget
Thy spirit deceive
If I should meet thee
After long years
How should I greet thee 
With silence and tears

George Gordon Byron 17881824


GO FORGET ME

Go forget me Why should sorrow
Oer that brow a shadow fling
Go forget me  and tomorrow
Brightly smile and sweetly sing
Smile  though I shall not be near thee
Sing  though I shall never hear thee
May thy soul with pleasure shine
Lasting as the gloom of mine

Like the sun thy presence glowing
Clothes the meanest things in light
And when thou like him art going
Loveliest objects fade in night
All things looked so bright about thee
That they nothing seem without thee
By that pure and lucid mind
Earthly things are too refined

Go thou vision wildly gleaming
Softly on my soul that fell
Go for me no longer beaming 
Hope and Beauty fare ye well
Go and all that once delighted
Take  and leave me all benighted
Glorys burning generous swell
Fancy and the poets shell

Charles Wolfe 17911823


LAST NIGHT

I sat with one I love last night
She sang to me an olden strain
In former times it woke delight
Last night  but pain

Last night we saw the stars arise
But clouds soon dimmed the ether blue
And when we sought each others eyes
Tears dimmed them too

We paced along our favorite walk
But paced in silence brokenhearted
Of old we used to smile and talk
Last night  we parted

George Darley 17951846


ADIEU

Let time and chance combine combine
Let time and chance combine
The fairest love from heaven above
That love of yours was mine
My dear
That love of yours was mine

The past is fled and gone and gone
The past is fled and gone
If naught but pain to me remain
Ill fare in memory on
My dear
Ill fare in memory on

The saddest tears must fall must fall
The saddest tears must fall
In weal or woe in this world below
I love you ever and all
My dear
I love you ever and all

A long road full of pain of pain
A long road full of pain
One soul one heart sworn neer to part 
We neer can meet again
My dear
We neer can meet again

Hard fate will not allow allow
Hard fate will not allow
We blessed were as the angels are 
Adieu forever now
My dear
Adieu forever now

Thomas Carlyle 17951881


JEANIE MORRISON

Ive wandered east Ive wandered west
Through mony a weary way
But never never can forget
The luve o lifes young day
The fire thats blawn on Beltane een
May weel be black gin Yule
But blacker fa awaits the heart
Where first fond luve grows cule

O dear dear Jeanie Morrison
The thochts o bygane years
Still fling their shadows owre my path
And blind my een wi tears
They blind my een wi saut saut tears
And sair and sick I pine
As Memory idly summons up
The blithe blinks o langsyne

Twas then we luvit ilk ither weel
Twas then we twa did part
Sweet time sad time  twa bairns at schule
Twa bairns and but ae heart
Twas then we sat on ae laigh bink
To leir ilk ither lear
And tones and looks and smiles were shed
Remembered evermair

I wonder Jeanie aften yet
When sitting on that bink
Cheek touchin cheek loof locked in loof
What our wee heads could think
When baith bent doun owre ae braid page
Wi ae buik on our knee
Thy lips were on thy lesson but
My lesson was in thee

Oh mind ye how we hung our heads
How cheeks brent red wi shame
Wheneer the schuleweans laughin said
We cleekd thegither hame
And mind ye o the Saturdays
The schule then skailt at noon
When we ran aff to speel the braes 
The broomy braes o June

My head rins round and round about
My heart flows like a sea
As ane by ane the thochts rush back
O schuletime and o thee
Oh mornin life Oh mornin luve
Oh lichtsome days and lang
When hinnied hopes around our hearts
Like simmer blossoms sprang

Oh mind ye luve how aft we left
The deavin dinsome toun
To wander by the green burnside
And hear its waters croon
The simmer leaves hung owre our heads
The flowers burst round our feet
And in the gloamin o the wud
The throssil whusslit sweet

The throssil whusslit in the wud
The burn sung to the trees
And we with Natures heart in tune
Concerted harmonies
And on the knowe abune the burn
For hours thegither sat
In the silentness o joy till baith
Wi very gladness grat

Ay ay dear Jeanie Morrison
Tears trinkled doun your cheek
Like dewbeads on a rose yet nane
Had ony power to speak
That was a time a blessed time
When hearts were fresh and young
When freely gushed all feelings forth
Unsyllabled  unsung

I marvel Jeanie Morrison
Gin I hae been to thee
As closely twined wi earliest thochts
As ye hae been to me
Oh tell me gin their music fills
Thine ear as it does mine
Oh say gin eer your heart grows great
Wi dreamings o langsyne

Ive wandered east Ive wandered west
Ive borne a weary lot
But in my wanderings far or near
Ye never were forgot
The fount that first burst frae this heart
Still travels on its way
And channels deeper as it rins
The luve o lifes young day

O dear dear Jeanie Morrison
Since we were sindered young
Ive never seen your face nor heard
The music o your tongue
But I could hug all wretchedness
And happy could I dee
Did I but ken your heart still dreamed
O bygane days and me

William Motherwell 17971835


THE SEALANDS

Would I were on the sealands
Where winds know how to sting
And in the rocks at midnight
The lost long murmurs sing

Would I were with my first love
To hear the rush and roar
Of spume below the doorstep
And winds upon the door

My first love was a fair girl
With ways forever new
And hair a sunlight yellow
And eyes a morning blue

The roses have they tarried
Or are they dun and frayed
If we had stayed together
Would love indeed have stayed

Ah years are filled with learning
And days are leaves of change
And I have met so many
I knew    and found them strange

But on the sealands tumbled
By winds that sting and blind
The nights we watched so silent
Come back come back to mind   

I mind about my first love
And hear the rush and roar
Of spume below the doorstep
And winds upon the door

Orrick Johns 1887


FAIR INES

O saw ye not fair Ines
Shes gone into the West
To dazzle when the sun is down
And rob the world of rest
She took our daylight with her
The smiles that we love best
With morning blushes on her cheek
And pearls upon her breast

O turn again fair Ines
Before the fall of night
For fear the Moon should shine alone
And stars unrivaled bright
And blessed will the lover be
That walks beneath their light
And breathes the love against thy cheek
I dare not even write

Would I had been fair Ines
That gallant cavalier
Who rode so gaily by thy side
And whispered thee so near
Were there no bonny dames at home
Or no true lovers here
That he should cross the seas to win
The dearest of the dear

I saw thee lovely Ines
Descend along the shore
With bands of noble gentlemen
And banners waved before
And gentle youth and maidens gay
And snowy plumes they wore
It would have been a beauteous dream 
If it had been no more

Alas alas fair Ines
She went away with song
With Music waiting on her steps
And shoutings of the throng
But some were sad and felt no mirth
But only Musics wrong
In sounds that sang Farewell farewell
To her youve loved so long

Farewell farewell fair Ines
That vessel never bore
So fair a lady on its deck
Nor danced so light before 
Alas for pleasure on the sea
And sorrow on the shore
The smile that blessed one lovers heart
Has broken many more

Thomas Hood 17991845


A VALEDICTION

God be with thee my beloved  God be with thee
Else alone thou goest forth
Thy face unto the north
Moor and pleasance all around thee and beneath thee
Looking equal in one snow
While I who try to reach thee
Vainly follow vainly follow
With the farewell and the hollo
And cannot reach thee so
Alas I can but teach thee
God be with thee my beloved  God be with thee

Can I teach thee my beloved  can I teach thee
If I said Go left or right
The counsel would be light
The wisdom poor of all that could enrich thee
My right would show like left
My raising would depress thee
My choice of light would blind thee
Of way  would leave behind thee
Of end  would leave bereft
Alas I can but bless thee
May God teach thee my beloved  may God teach thee

Can I bless thee my beloved  can I bless thee
What blessing word can I
From mine own tears keep dry
What flowers grow in my field wherewith to dress thee
My good reverts to ill
My calmnesses would move thee
My softnesses would prick thee
My bindings up would break thee
My crownings curse and kill
Alas I can but love thee
May God bless thee my beloved  may God bless thee

Can I love thee my beloved  can I love thee
And is this like love to stand
With no help in my hand
When strong as death I fain would watch above thee
My lovekiss can deny
No tear that falls beneath it
Mine oath of love can swear thee
From no ill that comes near thee
And thou diest while I breathe it
And I  I can but die
May God love thee my beloved  may God love thee

Elizabeth Barrett Browning 18061861


FAREWELL

Thou goest to what distant place
Wilt thou thy sunlight carry
I stay with cold and clouded face
How long am I to tarry
Whereer thou goest morn will be
Thou leavest night and gloom to me

The night and gloom I can but take
I do not grudge thy splendor
Bid souls of eager men awake
Be kind and bright and tender
Give day to other worlds for me
It must suffice to dream of thee

John Addington Symonds 18401893


I DO NOT LOVE THEE

I do not love thee  no I do not love thee
And yet when thou art absent I am sad
And envy even the bright blue sky above thee
Whose quiet stars may see thee and be glad

I do not love thee  yet I know not why
Whateer thou dost seems still well done to me
And often in my solitude I sigh
That those I do love are not more like thee

I do not love thee  yet when thou art gone
I hate the sound though those who speak be near
Which breaks the lingering echo of the tone
Thy voice of music leaves upon my ear

I do not love thee  yet thy speaking eyes
With their deep bright and most expressive blue
Between me and the midnight heaven arise
Oftener than any eyes I ever knew

I know I do not love thee  yet alas
Others will scarcely trust my candid heart
And oft I catch them smiling as they pass
Because they see me gazing where thou art

Caroline Elizabeth Sarah Norton 18081870


THE PALMTREE AND THE PINE

Beneath an Indian palm a girl
Of other blood reposes
Her cheek is clear and pale as pearl
Amid that wild of roses

Beside a northern pine a boy
Is leaning fancybound
Nor listens where with noisy joy
Awaits the impatient hound

Cool grows the sick and feverish calm 
Relaxed the frosty twine 
The pinetree dreameth of the palm
The palmtree of the pine

As soon shall nature interlace
Those dimlyvisioned boughs
As these young lovers face to face
Renew their early vows

Richard Monckton Milnes 18091885


O SWALLOW SWALLOW FLYING SOUTH
From The Princess

O Swallow Swallow flying flying South
Fly to her and fall upon her gilded eaves
And tell her tell her what I tell to thee

O tell her Swallow thou that knowest each
That bright and fierce and fickle is the South
And dark and true and tender is the North

O Swallow Swallow if I could follow and light
Upon her lattice I would pipe and trill
And cheep and twitter twenty million loves

O were I thou that she might take me in
And lay me on her bosom and her heart
Would rock the snowy cradle till I died

Why lingereth she to clothe her heart with love
Delaying as the tender ash delays
To clothe herself when all the woods are green

O tell her Swallow that thy brood is flown
Say to her I do but wanton in the South
But in the North long since my nest is made

O tell her brief is life but love is long
And brief the sun of summer in the North
And brief the moon of beauty in the South

O Swallow flying from the golden woods
Fly to her and pipe and woo her and make her mine
And tell her tell her that I follow thee

Alfred Tennyson 18091892


THE FLOWERS NAME

Heres the garden she walked across
Arm in my arm such a short while since
Hark now I push its wicket the moss
Hinders the hinges and makes them wince
She must have reached this shrub ere she turned
As back with that murmur the wicket swung
For she laid the poor snail my chance foot spurned
To feed and forget it the leaves among

Down this side of the gravelwalk
She went while her robes edge brushed the box
And here she paused in her gracious talk
To point me a moth on the milkwhite phlox
Roses ranged in valiant row
I will never think that she passed you by
She loves you noble roses I know
But yonder see where the rockplants lie

This flower she stopped at finger on lip
Stooped over in doubt as settling its claim
Till she gave me with pride to make no slip
Its soft meandering Spanish name
What a name Was it love or praise
Speech halfasleep or song halfawake
I must learn Spanish one of these days
Only for that slow sweet names sake

Roses if I live and do well
I may bring her one of these days
To fix you fast with as fine a spell
Fit you each with his Spanish phrase
But do not detain me now for she lingers
There like sunshine over the ground
And ever I see her soft white fingers
Searching after the bud she found

Flower you Spaniard look that you grow not
Stay as you are and be loved forever
Bud if I kiss you tis that you blow not
Mind the shut pink mouth opens never
For while it pouts her fingers wrestle
Twinkling the audacious leaves between
Till round they turn and down they nestle 
Is not the dear mark still to be seen

Where I find her not beauties vanish
Whither I follow her beauties flee
Is there no method to tell her in Spanish
Junes twice June since she breathed it with me
Come bud show me the least of her traces
Treasure my ladys lightest footfall
 Ah you may flout and turn up your faces 
Roses you are not so fair after all

Robert Browning 18121889


TO MARGUERITE

Yes in the sea of life enisled
With echoing straits between us thrown
Dotting the shoreless watery wild
We mortal millions live alone
The islands feel the enclasping flow
And then their endless bounds they know

But when the moon their hollows lights
And they are swept by balms of spring
And in their glens on starry nights
The nightingales divinely sing
And lovely notes from shore to shore
Across the sounds and channels pour

O then a longing like despair
Is to their farthest caverns sent
For surely once they feel we were
Parts of a single continent
Now round us spreads the watery plain 
O might our marges meet again

Who ordered that their longings fire
Should be as soon as kindled cooled
Who renders vain their deep desire 
A God a God their severance ruled
And bade betwixt their shores to be
The unplumbed salt estranging sea

Matthew Arnold 18221888


SEPARATION

Stop  not to me at this bitter departing
Speak of the sure consolations of time
Fresh be the wound stillrenewed be its smarting
So but thy image endure in its prime

But if the steadfast commandment of Nature
Wills that remembrance should always decay 
If the loved form and the deepcherished feature
Must when unseen from the soul fade away 

Me let no halfeffaced memories cumber
Fled fled at once be all vestige of thee
Deep be the darkness and still be the slumber 
Dead be the past and its phantoms to me

Then when we meet and thy look strays towards me
Scanning my face and the changes wrought there
Who let me say is this stranger regards me
With the gray eyes and the lovely brown hair

Matthew Arnold 18221888


LONGING

Come to me in my dreams and then
By day I shall be well again
For then the night will more than pay
The hopeless longing of the day

Come as thou camst a thousand times
A messenger from radiant climes
And smile on thy new world and be
As kind to others as to me

Or as thou never camst in sooth
Come now and let me dream it truth
And part my hair and kiss my brow
And say My love why sufferest thou

Come to me in my dreams and then
By day I shall be well again
For then the night will more than pay
The hopeless longing of the day

Matthew Arnold 18221888


DIVIDED

I
An empty sky a world of heather
Purple of foxglove yellow of broom
We two among them wading together
Shaking out honey treading perfume

Crowds of bees are giddy with clover
Crowds of grasshoppers skip at our feet
Crowds of larks at their matins hang over
Thanking the Lord for a life so sweet

Flusheth the rise with her purple favor
Gloweth the cleft with her golden ring
Twixt the two brown butterflies waver
Lightly settle and sleepily swing

We two walk till the purple dieth
And short dry grass under foot is brown
But one little streak at a distance lieth
Green like a ribbon to prank the down

II
Over the grass we stepped unto it
And God He knoweth how blithe we were
Never a voice to bid us eschew it
Hey the green ribbon that showed so fair

Hey the green ribbon we kneeled beside it
We parted the grasses dewy and sheen
Drop over drop there filtered and slided
A tiny bright beck that trickled between

Tinkle tinkle sweetly it sung to us
Light was our talk as of fairy bells 
Fairy weddingbells faintly rung to us
Down in their fortunate parallels

Hand in hand while the sun peered over
We lapped the grass on that youngling spring
Swept back its rushes smoothed its clover
And said Let us follow it westering

III
A dappled sky a world of meadows
Circling above us the black rooks fly
Forward backward lo their dark shadows
Flit on the blossoming tapestry 

Flit on the beck for her long grass parteth
As hair from a maids bright eyes blown back
And lo the sun like a lover darteth
His flattering smile on her wayward track

Sing on we sing in the glorious weather
Till one steps over the tiny strand
So narrow in sooth that still together
On either brink we go hand in hand

The beck grows wider the hands must sever
On either margin our songs all done
We move apart while she singeth ever
Taking the course of the stooping sun

He prays Come over  I may not follow
I cry Return  but he cannot come
We speak we laugh but with voices hollow
Our hands are hanging our hearts are numb

IV
A breathing sigh a sigh for answer
A little talking of outward things
The careless beck is a merry dancer
Keeping sweet time to the air she sings

A little pain when the beck grows wider
Cross to me now for her wavelets swell
I may not cross  and the voice beside her
Faintly reacheth though heeded well

No backward path ah no returning
No second crossing that ripples flow
Come to me now for the west is burning
Come ere it darkens  Ah no ah no

Then cries of pain and arms outreaching 
The beck grows wider and swift and deep
Passionate words as of one beseeching
The loud beck drowns them we walk and weep

V
A yellow moon in splendor drooping
A tired queen with her state oppressed
Low by rushes and swordgrass stooping
Lies she soft on the waves at rest

The desert heavens have felt her sadness
Her earth will weep her some dewy tears
The wild beck ends her tune of gladness
And goeth stilly as soul that fears

We two walk on in our grassy places
On either marge of the moonlit flood
With the moons own sadness in our faces
Where joy is withered blossom and bud

VI
A shady freshness chafers whirring
A little piping of leafhid birds
A flutter of wings a fitful stirring
A cloud to the eastward snowy as curds

Bare grassy slopes where kids are tethered
Round valleys like nests all fernylined
Round hills with fluttering treetops feathered
Swell high in their freckled robes behind

A roseflush tender a thrill a quiver
When golden gleams to the treetops glide
A flashing edge for the milkwhite river
The beck a river  with still sleek tide

Broad and white and polished as silver
On she goes under fruitladen trees
Sunk in leafage cooeth the culver
And plaineth of loves disloyalties

Glitters the dew and shines the river
Up comes the lily and dries her bell
But two are walking apart forever
And wave their hands for a mute farewell

VII
A braver swell a swifter sliding
The river hasteth her banks recede
Winglike sails on her bosom gliding
Bear down the lily and drown the reed

Stately prows are rising and bowing
Shouts of mariners winnow the air
And level sands for banks endowing
The tiny green ribbon that showed so fair

While O my heart as white sails shiver
And clouds are passing and banks stretch wide
How hard to follow with lips that quiver
That moving speck on the faroff side

Farther farther I see it know it 
My eyes brim over it melts away
Only my heart to my heart shall show it
As I walk desolate day by day

VIII
And yet I know past all doubting truly 
A knowledge greater than grief can dim 
I know as he loved he will love me duly 
Yea better een better than I love him

And as I walk by the vast calm river
The awful river so dread to see
I say Thy breadth and thy depth forever
Are bridged by his thoughts that cross to me

Jean Ingelow 18201897


MY PLAYMATE

The pines were dark on Ramoth hill
Their song was soft and low
The blossoms in the sweet May wind
Were falling like the snow

The blossoms drifted at our feet
The orchard birds sang clear
The sweetest and the saddest day
It seemed of all the year

For more to me than birds or flowers
My playmate left her home
And took with her the laughing spring
The music and the bloom

She kissed the lips of kith and kin
She laid her hand in mine
What more could ask the bashful boy
Who fed her fathers kine

She left us in the bloom of May
The constant years told oer
Their seasons with as sweet May morns
But she came back no more

I walk with noiseless feet the round
Of uneventful years
Still oer and oer I sow the spring
And reap the autumn ears

She lives where all the golden year
Her summer roses blow
The dusky children of the sun
Before her come and go

There haply with her jeweled hands
She smooths her silken gown 
No more the homespun lap wherein
I shook the walnuts down

The wild grapes wait us by the brook
The brown nuts on the hill
And still the Mayday flowers make sweet
The woods of Follymill

The lilies blossom in the pond
The bird builds in the tree
The dark pines sing on Ramoth hill
The slow song of the sea

I wonder if she thinks of them
And how the old time seems 
If ever the pines of Ramoth wood
Are sounding in her dreams

I see her face I hear her voice
Does she remember mine
And what to her is now the boy
Who fed her fathers kine

What cares she that the orioles build
For other eyes than ours 
That other laps with nuts are filled
And other hands with flowers

O playmate in the golden time
Our mossy seat is green
Its fringing violets blossom yet
The old trees oer it lean

The winds so sweet with birch and fern
A sweeter memory blow
And there in spring the veeries sing
The song of long ago

And still the pines of Ramoth wood
Are moaning like the sea 
The moaning of the sea of change
Between myself and thee

John Greenleaf Whittier 18071892


A FAREWELL

With all my will but much against my heart
We two now part
My Very Dear
Our solace is the sad road lies so clear
It needs no art
With faint averted feet
And many a tear
In our opposed paths to persevere
Go thou to East I West
We will not say
Theres any hope it is so far away
But O my Best
When the one darling of our widowhead
The nursling Grief
Is dead
And no dews blur our eyes
To see the peachbloom come in evening skies
Perchance we may
Where now this night is day
And even through faith of still averted feet
Making full circle of our banishment
Amazed meet
The bitter journey to the bourne so sweet
Seasoning the termless feast of our content
With tears of recognition never dry

Coventry Patmore 18231896


DEPARTURE

It was not like your great and gracious ways
Do you that have naught other to lament
Never my Love repent
Of how that July afternoon
You went
With sudden unintelligible phrase
And frightened eye
Upon your journey of so many days
Without a single kiss or a goodbye
I knew indeed that you were parting soon
And so we sate within the low suns rays
You whispering to me for your voice was weak
Your harrowing praise
Well it was well
To hear you such things speak
And I could tell
What made your eyes a glowing gloom of love
As a warm Southwind sombers a March grove

And it was like your great and gracious ways
To turn your talk on daily things my Dear
Lifting the luminous pathetic lash
To let the laughter flash
Whilst I drew near
Because you spoke so low that I could scarcely hear
But all at once to leave me at the last
More at the wonder than the loss aghast
With huddled unintelligible phrase
And frightened eye
And go your journey of all days
With not one kiss or a goodbye
And the only loveless look the look with which you passed
Twas all unlike your great and gracious ways

Coventry Patmore 18231896


A SONG OF PARTING

My dear the time has come to say
Farewell to London town
Farewell to each familiar street
The room where we looked down
Upon the people going by
The river flowing fast
The innumerable shine of lamps
The bridges and  our past

Our past of London days and nights
When every night we dreamed
Of Love and Art and Happiness
And every day it seemed
Ah little room you held my life
In you I found my all
A white hand on the mantelpiece
A shadow on the wall

My dear what dinners we have had
What cigarettes and wine
In faded corners of Soho
Your fingers touching mine
And now the time has come to say
Farewell to London town
The prologue of our play is done
So ring the curtain down

There lies a crowded life ahead
In field and sleepy lane
A fairer picture than we saw
Framed in our windowpane
Therell be the stars on summer nights
The white moon through the trees
Moths and the song of nightingales
To float along the breeze

And in the morning we shall see
The swallows in the sun
And hear the cuckoo on the hill
Welcome a day begun
And life will open with the rose
For me sweet and for you
And on our life and on the rose
How soft the falling dew

So let us take this tranquil path
But drop a parting tear
For town whose greatest gift to us
Was to be lovers here

H C Compton Mackenzie 1833


SONG
From The Earthly Paradise

Fair is the night and fair the day
Now April is forgot of May
Now into June May falls away
Fair day fair night O give me back
The tide that all fair things did lack
Except my Love except my Sweet

Blow back O wind thou art not kind
Though thou art sweet thou hast no mind
Her hair about my Sweet to bind
O flowery sward though thou art bright
I praise thee not for thy delight 
Thou hast not kissed her silver feet

Thou knowst her not O rustling tree
What dost thou then to shadow me
Whose shade her breast did never see
O flowers in vain ye bow adown
Ye have not felt her odorous gown
Brush past your heads my lips to meet

Flow on great river thou mayst deem
That far away a summer stream
Thou sawst her limbs amidst the gleam
And kissed her foot and kissed her knee
Yet get thee swift unto the sea
With naught of true thou wilt me greet

And Thou that men call by my name
O helpless One hast thou no shame
That thou must even look the same
As while agone as while agone
When Thou and She were left alone
And hands and lips and tears did meet

Grow weak and pine lie down to die
O body in thy misery
Because short time and sweet goes by
O foolish heart how weak thou art
Break break because thou needs must part
From thine own Love from thine own Sweet

William Morris 18341896


AT PARTING

For a day and a night Love sang to us played with us
Folded us round from the dark and the light
And our hearts were fulfilled of the music he made with us
Made with our hearts and our lips while he stayed with us
Stayed in mid passage his pinions from flight
For a day and a night

From his foes that kept watch with his wings had he hidden us
Covered us close from the eyes that would smite
From the feet that had tracked and the tongues that had chidden us
Sheltering in shade of the myrtles forbidden us
Spirit and flesh growing one with delight
For a day and a night

But his wings will not rest and his feet will not stay for us
Morning is here in the joy of its might
With his breath has he sweetened a night and a day for us
Now let him pass and the myrtles make way for us
Love can but last in us here at his height
For a day and a night

Algernon Charles Swinburne 18371909


IF SHE BUT KNEW

If she but knew that I am weeping
Still for her sake
That love and sorrow grow with keeping
Till they must break
My heart that breaking will adore her
Be hers and die
If she might hear me once implore her
Would she not sigh

If she but knew that it would save me
Her voice to hear
Saying she pitied me forgave me
Must she forbear
If she were told that I was dying
Would she be dumb
Could she content herself with sighing
Would she not come

Arthur OShaughnessy 18441881


KATHLEEN MAVOURNEEN

Kathleen Mavourneen the gray dawn is breaking
The horn of the hunter is heard on the hill
The lark from her light wing the bright dew is shaking 
Kathleen Mavourneen what slumbering still
Oh hast thou forgotten how soon we must sever
Oh hast thou forgotten this day we must part
It may be for years and it may be forever
Oh why art thou silent thou voice of my heart
Oh why art thou silent Kathleen Mavourneen

Kathleen Mavourneen awake from thy slumbers
The blue mountains glow in the suns golden light
Ah where is the spell that once hung on my numbers
Arise in thy beauty thou star of my night
Mavourneen Mavourneen my sad tears are falling
To think that from Erin and thee I must part
It may be for years and it may be forever
Then why art thou silent thou voice of my heart
Then why art thou silent Kathleen Mavourneen

Louisa Macartney Crawford 17901858


ROBIN ADAIR

Whats this dull town to me
Robins not near 
He whom I wished to see
Wished for to hear
Wheres all the joy and mirth
Made life a heaven on earth
O theyre all fled with thee
Robin Adair

What made the assembly shine
Robin Adair
What made the ball so fine
Robin was there
What when the play was oer
What made my heart so sore
O it was parting with
Robin Adair

But now thou art far from me
Robin Adair
But now I never see
Robin Adair
Yet him I loved so well
Still in my heart shall dwell
O I can neer forget
Robin Adair

Welcome on shore again
Robin Adair
Welcome once more again
Robin Adair
I feel thy trembling hand
Tears in thy eyelids stand
To greet thy native land
Robin Adair

Long I neer saw thee love
Robin Adair
Still I prayed for thee love
Robin Adair
When thou wert far at sea
Many made love to me
But still I thought on thee
Robin Adair

Come to my heart again
Robin Adair
Never to part again
Robin Adair
And if thou still art true
I will be constant too
And will wed none but you
Robin Adair

Caroline Keppel 1735  


IF YOU WERE HERE
A Song In Winter

O love if you were here
This dreary weary day 
If your lips warm and dear
Found some sweet word to say 
Then hardly would seem drear
These skies of wintry gray

But you are far away 
How far from me my dear
What cheer can warm the day
My heart is chill with fear
Pierced through with swift dismay
A thought has turned Life sere

If you from far away
Should come not back my dear
If I no more might lay
My hand on yours nor hear
That voice now sad now gay
Caress my listening ear

If you from far away
Should come no more my dear 
Then with what dire dismay
Year joined to hostile year
Would frown if I should stay
Where memories mock and jeer

But I would come away
To dwell with you my dear
Through unknown worlds to stray 
Or sleep nor hope nor fear
Nor dream beneath the clay
Of all our days that were

Philip Bourke Marston 18501887


COME TO ME DEAREST

Come to me dearest Im lonely without thee
Daytime and nighttime Im thinking about thee
Nighttime and daytime in dreams I behold thee
Unwelcome the waking which ceases to fold thee
Come to me darling my sorrows to lighten
Come in thy beauty to bless and to brighten
Come in thy womanhood meekly and lowly
Come in thy lovingness queenly and holy

Swallows will flit round the desolate ruin
Telling of spring and its joyous renewing
And thoughts of thy love and its manifold treasure
Are circling my heart with a promise of pleasure
O Spring of my spirit O May of my bosom
Shine out on my soul till it bourgeon and blossom
The waste of my life has a roseroot within it
And thy fondness alone to the sunshine can win it

Figure that moves like a song through the even
Features lit up by a reflex of heaven
Eyes like the skies of poor Erin our mother
Where shadow and sunshine are chasing each other
Smiles coming seldom but childlike and simple
Planting in each rosy cheek a sweet dimple 
O thanks to the Saviour that even thy seeming
Is left to the exile to brighten his dreaming

You have been glad when you knew I was gladdened
Dear are you sad now to hear I am saddened
Our hearts ever answer in tune and in time love
As octave to octave and rhyme unto rhyme love
I cannot weep but your tears will be flowing
You cannot smile but my cheek will be glowing
I would not die without you at my side love
You will not linger when I shall have died love

Come to me dear ere I die of my sorrow
Rise on my gloom like the sun of tomorrow
Strong swift and fond are the words which I speak love
With a song on your lip and a smile on your cheek love
Come for my heart in your absence is weary 
Haste for my spirit is sickened and dreary 
Come to my arms which alone should caress thee
Come to the heart which is throbbing to press thee

Joseph Brenan 18291857


SONG

Tis said that absence conquers love
But oh believe it not
Ive tried alas its power to prove
But thou art not forgot
Lady though fate has bid us part
Yet still thou art as dear
As fixed in this devoted heart
As when I clasped thee here

I plunge into the busy crowd
And smile to hear thy name
And yet as if I thought aloud
They know me still the same
And when the winecup passes round
I toast some other fair 
But when I ask my heart the sound
Thy name is echoed there

And when some other name I learn
And try to whisper love
Still will my heart to thee return
Like the returning dove
In vain I never can forget
And would not be forgot
For I must bear the same regret
Whateer may be my lot

Een as the wounded bird will seek
Its favorite bower to die
So lady I would hear thee speak
And yield my parting sigh
Tis said that absence conquers love
But oh believe it not
Ive tried alas its power to prove
But thou art not forgot

Frederick William Thomas 18111864


PARTING

Too fair I may not call thee mine
Too dear I may not see
Those eyes with bridal beacons shine
Yet Darling keep for me 
Empty and hushed and safe apart 
One little corner of thy heart

Thou wilt be happy dear and bless
Thee happy mayst thou be
I would not make thy pleasure less
Yet Darling keep for me 
My life to light my lot to leaven 
One little corner of thy Heaven

Goodby dear heart I go to dwell
A weary way from thee
Our first kiss is our last farewell
Yet Darling keep for me 
Who wander outside in the night 
One little corner of thy light

Gerald Massey 18281907


THE PARTING HOUR

Not yet dear love not yet the sun is high
You said last night At sunset I will go
Come to the garden where when blossoms die
No word is spoken it is better so
Ah bitter word Farewell

Hark how the birds sing sunny songs of spring
Soon they will build and work will silence them
So we grow less lighthearted as years bring
Lifes grave responsibilities  and then
The bitter word Farewell

The violets fret to fragrance neath your feet
Heavens gold sunlight dreams aslant your hair
No flower for me your mouth is far more sweet
O let my lips forget while lingering there
Loves bitter word Farewell

Sunset already have we sat so long
The parting hour and so much left unsaid
The garden has grown silent  void of song
Our sorrow shakes us with a sudden dread
Ah bitter word Farewell

Olive Custance 1874


A SONG OF AUTUMN

All through the golden weather
Until the autumn fell
Our lives went by together
So wildly and so well

But autumns wind uncloses
The heart of all your flowers
I think as with the roses
So hath it been with ours

Like some divided river
Your ways and mine will be
To drift apart for ever
For ever till the sea

And yet for one word spoken
One whisper of regret
The dream had not been broken
And love were with us yet

Rennell Rodd 1858


THE GIRL I LEFT BEHIND ME

The dames of France are fond and free
And Flemish lips are willing
And soft the maids of Italy
And Spanish eyes are thrilling
Still though I bask beneath their smile
Their charms fail to bind me
And my heart falls back to Erins Isle
To the girl I left behind me

For shes as fair as Shannons side
And purer than its water
But she refused to be my bride
Though many a year I sought her
Yet since to France I sailed away
Her letters oft remind me
That I promised never to gainsay
The girl I left behind me

She says My own dear love come home
My friends are rich and many
Or else abroad with you Ill roam
A soldier stout as any
If youll not come nor let me go
Ill think you have resigned me 
My heart nigh broke when I answered No
To the girl I left behind me

For never shall my true love brave
A life of war and toiling
And never as a skulking slave
Ill tread my native soil on
But were it free or to be freed
The battles close would find me
To Ireland bound nor message need
From the girl I left behind me

Unknown


WHEN WE ARE PARTED

When we are parted let me lie
In some far corner of thy heart
Silent and from the world apart
Like a forgotten melody
Forgotten of the world beside
Cherished by one and one alone
For some loved memory of its own
So let me in thy heart abide
When we are parted

When we are parted keep for me
The sacred stillness of the night
That hour sweet Love is mine by right
Let others claim the day of thee
The cold world sleeping at our feet
My spirit shall discourse with thine 
When stars upon thy pillow shine
At thy hearts door I stand and beat
Though we are parted

Hamilton Aide 18261906


REMEMBER OR FORGET

I sat beside the streamlet
I watched the water flow
As we together watched it
One little year ago
The soft rain pattered on the leaves
The April grass was wet
Ah folly to remember
Tis wiser to forget

The nightingales made vocal
Junes palace paved with gold
I watched the rose you gave me
Its warm red heart unfold
But breath of rose and birds song
Were fraught with wild regret
Tis madness to remember
Twere wisdom to forget

I stood among the gold corn
Alas no more I knew
To gather gleaners measure
Of the love that fell from you
For me no gracious harvest 
Would God we neer had met
Tis hard Love to remember
But tis harder to forget

The streamlet now is frozen
The nightingales are fled
The cornfields are deserted
And every rose is dead
I sit beside my lonely fire
And pray for wisdom yet
For calmness to remember
Or courage to forget

Hamilton Aide 18261906


NANCY DAWSON

Nancy Dawson Nancy Dawson
Not so very long ago
Some one wronged you from sheer love dear
Little thinking it would crush dear
All I cherished in you so
But now whats the odds my Nancy
Wheres the guinea theres the fancy
Are you Nancy that old Nancy
Nancy Dawson

Nancy Dawson Nancy Dawson
I forget you what you were
Till I feel the sad hours creep dear
Oer my heart as oer my cheek dear
Once of old that old old hair
And then unawares my Nancy
I remember and I fancy
You are Nancy that old Nancy
Nancy Dawson

Herbert P Horne 1864


MY LITTLE LOVE

God keep you safe my little love
All through the night
Rest close in His encircling arms
Until the light
My heart is with you as I kneel to pray
Good night God keep you in His care alway

Thick shadows creep like silent ghosts
About my bed
I lose myself in tender dreams
While overhead
The moon comes stealing through the window bars
A silver sickle gleaming mid the stars

For I though I am far away
Feel safe and strong
To trust you thus dear love and yet
The night is long
I say with sobbing breath the old fond prayer
Good night Sweet dreams God keep you everywhere

Charles B Hawley 1858


FOR EVER

Thrice with her lips she touched my lips
Thrice with her hand my hand
And three times thrice looked towards the sea
But never to the land
Then Sweet she said no more delay
For Heaven forbids a longer stay

I with my passion in my heart
Could find no words to waste
But striving often to depart
I strained her to my breast
Her wet tears washed my weary cheek
I could have died but could not speak

The anchor swings the sheet flies loose
And bending to the breeze
The tall ship never to return
Flies through the foaming seas
Cheerily ho the sailors cry 
My sweet love lessening to my eye

O Love turn towards the land thy sight
No more peruse the sea
Our God who severs thus our hearts
Shall surely care for thee
For me let wastewide ocean swing
I too lie safe beneath His wing

William Caldwell Roscoe 18231859


AUF WIEDERSEHEN

The little gate was reached at last
Half hid in lilacs down the lane
She pushed it wide and as she passed
A wistful look she backward cast
And said  Auf wiedersehen

With hand on latch a vision white
Lingered reluctant and again
Half doubting if she did aright
Soft as the dews that fell that night
She said  Auf wiedersehen

The lamps clear gleam flits up the stair
I linger in delicious pain
Ah in that chamber whose rich air
To breathe in thought I scarcely dare
Thinks she  Auf wiedersehen   

Tis thirteen years once more I press
The turf that silences the lane
I hear the rustle of her dress
I smell the lilacs and  ah yes
I hear  Auf wiedersehen

Sweet piece of bashful maiden art
The English words had seemed too fain
But these  they drew us heart to heart
Yet held us tenderly apart
She said  Auf wiedersehen

James Russell Lowell 18191891


FOREVER AND A DAY

I little know or care
If the blackbird on the bough
Is filling all the air
With his soft crescendo now
For she is gone away
And when she went she took
The springtime in her look
The peachblow on her cheek
The laughter from the brook
The blue from out the May 
And what she calls a week
Is forever and a day

Its little that I mind
How the blossoms pink or white
At every touch of wind
Fall atrembling with delight
For in the leafy lane
Beneath the gardenboughs
And through the silent house
One thing alone I seek
Until she come again
The May is not the May
And what she calls a week
Is forever and a day

Thomas Bailey Aldrich 18371907


OLD GARDENS

The white rose tree that spent its musk
For lovers sweeter praise
The stately walks we sought at dusk
Have missed thee many days

Again with oncefamiliar feet
I tread the old parterre 
But ah its bloom is now less sweet
Than when thy face was there

I hear the birds of evening call
I take the wild perfume
I pluck a rose  to let it fall
And perish in the gloom

Arthur Upson 18771908


FERRY HINKSEY

Beyond the ferry water
That fast and silent flowed
She turned she gazed a moment
Then took her onward road

Between the winding willows
To a city white with spires
It seemed a path of pilgrims
To the home of earths desires

Blue shade of golden branches
Spread for her journeying
Till he that lingered lost her
Among the leaves of Spring

Laurence Binyon 1869 


WEARYIN FER YOU

Jest awearyin fer you 
All the time afeelin blue
Wishin fer you  wonderin when
Youll be comin home again
Restless  dont know what to do

Rooms so lonesome with your chair
Empty by the fireplace there
Jest cant stand the sight o it
Go outdoors an roam a bit
But the woods is lonesome too

Like the rustlin o your dress
An the dew on flower an tree
Tinkles like your steps to me
Violets like your eyes so blue 
Jest awearyin fer you

Mornin comes the birds awake
Them that sung so fer your sake
But theres sadness in the notes
That come thrillin from their throats
Seem to feel your absence too 
Jest awearyin fer you

Evenin comes I miss you more
When the dark is in the door
Pears jest like you orter be
There to open fer me
Latch goes tinklin  thrills me through
Sets me wearyin fer you

        

Jest awearyin fer you 
All the time afeelin blue
Wishin fer you  wonderin when
Youll be comin home again
Restless  dont know what to do 
Jest awearyin fer you

THE LOVERS OF MARCHAID

Dominic came riding down sworded straight and splendid
Drave his hilt against her door flung a golden chain
Said Ill teach your lips a song sweet as his thats ended
Ere the white rose call the bee the almond flower again

But he only saw her head bent within the gloom
Over heaps of bridal thread bright as applebloom
Silver silk like rain that spread across the driving loom

Dreaming Fanch the cobblers son took his tools and laces
Wrought her shoes of scarlet dye shoes as pale as snow
They shall lead her wildrose feet all the fairy paces
Danced along the road of love the road such feet should go 

But he only saw her eyes turning from his gift
Out towards the silver skies where the white clouds drift
Where the wild gerfalcon flies where the last sails lift

Bran has built his homestead high where the hills may shield her
Where the young bird waits the spring where the dawns are fair
Said Ill name my trees for her since I may not yield her
Stars of morning for her feet of evening for her hair

But he did not see them ride seven dim sail and more
All along the harborside white from shore to shore
Nor heard the voices of the tide crying at her door

JeanMarie has touched his pipe down beside the river
When the young fox bends the fern when the folds are still
Said I send her all the gifts that my love may give her 
Golden notes like golden birds to seek her at my will

But he only found the waves heard the seagulls cry
In and out the ocean caves underneath the sky
All above the windwashed graves where dead seamen lie

Marjorie L C Pickthall 18831922


SONG

Shes somewhere in the sunlight strong
Her tears are in the falling rain
She calls me in the winds soft song
And with the flowers she comes again

Yon bird is but her messenger
The moon is but her silver car
Yea sun and moon are sent by her
And every wistful waiting star

Richard Le Gallienne 1866


THE LOVER THINKS OF HIS LADY IN THE NORTH

Now many are the stately ships that northward steam away
And gray sails northward blow black hulls and many more are they
And myriads of viking gulls flap to the northern seas
But Oh my thoughts that go to you are more than all of these

The winds blow to the northward like a million eager wings
The driven sea a million whitecapped waves to northward flings
I send you thoughts more many than the waves that fleck the sea
More eager than tempestuous winds O Love long leagues from me

O Love long leagues from me I would I trod the drenched deck
Of some ship speeding to the North and staunch against all wreck
I would I were a seagull strong of wing and void of fear
Unfaltering and fleet Id fly the long way to my Dear

O if I were the sea upon your northern land Id beat
Until my waves flowed over all and kissed your wandering feet
And if I were the winds Id waft you perfumes from the South
And give my pleadings to your ears my kisses to your mouth

Though many ships are sailing never one will carry me
I may not hurry northward with the gulls the winds the sea
But fervid thoughts they say can flash across long leagues of blue 
Ah so my love and longing must be known Dear Heart to you

Shaemas O Sheel 1886


CHANSON DE ROSEMONDE

The dawn is lonely for the sun
And chill and drear
The one lone star is pale and wan
As one in fear

But when day strides across the hills
The warm blood rushes through
The bared soft bosom of the blue
And all the glad east thrills

Oh come my king The hounds of joy
Are waiting for thy horn
To chase the doe of hearts desire
Across the heights of morn

Oh come my Sun and let me know
The rapture of the day
Oh come my love Oh come my love
Thou art so long away

Richard Hovey 18641900


AD DOMNULAM SUAM

Little lady of my heart
Just a little longer
Love me we will pass and part
Ere this love grow stronger

I have loved thee Child too well
To do aught but leave thee
Nay my lips should never tell
Any tale to grieve thee

Little lady of my heart
Just a little longer
I may love thee we will part
Ere my love grow stronger

Soon thou leavest fairyland
Darker grow thy tresses
Soon no more of hand in hand
Soon no more caresses

Little lady of my heart
Just a little longer
Be a child then we will part
Ere this love grow stronger

Ernest Dowson 18671900


MARIAN DRURY

Marian Drury Marian Drury
How are the marshes full of the sea
Acadie dreams of your coming home
All year through and her heart gets free 

Free on the trail of the wind to travel
Search and course with the roving tide
All year long where his hands unravel
Blossom and berry the marshes hide

Marian Drury Marian Drury
How are the marshes full of the surge
April over the Norland now
Walks in the quiet from verge to verge

Burying brimming the building billows
Fret the long dikes with uneasy foam
Drenched with gold weather the idling willows
Kiss you a hand from the Norland home

Marian Drury Marian Drury
How are the marshes full of the sun
Blomidon waits for your coming home
All day long where the white wings run

All spring through they falter and follow
Wander and beckon the roving tide
Wheel and float with the veering swallow
Lift you a voice from the blue hillside

Marian Drury Marian Drury
How are the marshes full of the rain
April over the Norland now
Bugles for rapture and rouses pain 

Halts before the forsaken dwelling
Where in the twilight too spent to roam
Love whom the fingers of death are quelling
Cries you a cheer from the Norland home

Marian Drury Marian Drury
How are the marshes filled with you
Grand Pre dreams of your coming home 
Dreams while the rainbirds all night through

Far in the uplands calling to win you
Tease the brown dusk on the marshes wide
And never the burning heart within you
Stirs in your sleep by the roving tide

Bliss Carman 18611929


LOVES ROSARY

All day I tell my rosary
For now my loves away
Tomorrow he shall come to me
About the break of day
A rosary of twenty hours
And then a rose of May
A rosary of fettered flowers
And then a holyday

All day I tell my rosary
My rosary of hours
And heres a flower of memory
And heres a hope of flowers
And heres an hour that yearns with pain
For old forgotten years
An hour of loss an hour of gain
And then a shower of tears

All day I tell my rosary
Because my loves away
And never a whisper comes to me
And never a word to say
But if its parting more endears
God bring him back I pray
Or my heart will break in the darkness
Before the break of day

All day I tell my rosary
My rosary of hours
Until an hour shall bring to me
The hope of all the flowers   
I tell my rosary of hours
For O my loves away
And  a dream may bring him back to me
About the break of day

Alfred Noyes 1880


WHEN SHE COMES HOME

When she comes home again A thousand ways
I fashion to myself the tenderness
Of my glad welcome I shall tremble  yes
And touch her as when first in the old days
I touched her girlish hand nor dared upraise
Mine eyes such was my faint hearts sweet distress
Then silence and the perfume of her dress
The room will sway a little and a haze
Cloy eyesight  soulsight even  for a space
And tears  yes and the ache here in the throat
To know that I so ill deserve the place
Her arms make for me and the sobbing note
I stay with kisses ere the tearful face
Again is hidden in the old embrace

James Whitcomb Riley 18491916







THE TRAGEDY OF LOVE






SONG

My silks and fine array
My smiles and languished air
By Love are driven away
And mournful lean Despair
Brings me yew to deck my grave
Such end true lovers have

His face is fair as heaven
When springing buds unfold
O why to him wast given
Whose heart is wintry cold
His breast is Loves allworshipped tomb
Where all Loves pilgrims come

Bring me an ax and spade
Bring me a windingsheet
When I my grave have made
Let winds and tempests beat
Then down Ill lie as cold as clay
True love doth pass away

William Blake 17571827


THE FLIGHT OF LOVE

When the lamp is shattered
The light in the dust lies dead 
When the cloud is scattered
The rainbows glory is shed
When the lute is broken
Sweet tones are remembered not
When the lips have spoken
Loved accents are soon forgot

As music and splendor
Survive not the lamp and the lute
The hearts echoes render
No song when the spirit is mute 
No song but sad dirges
Like the wind through a ruined cell
Or the mournful surges
That ring the dead seamans knell

When hearts have once mingled
Love first leaves the wellbuilt nest
The weak one is singled
To endure what it once possessed
O Love who bewailest
The frailty of all things here
Why choose you the frailest
For your cradle your home and your bier

Its passions will rock thee
As the storms rock the ravens on high
Bright reason will mock thee
Like the sun from a wintry sky
From thy nest every rafter
Will rot and thine eagle home
Leave thee naked to laughter
When leaves fall and cold winds come

Percy Bysshe Shelley 17921822


FAREWELL IF EVER FONDEST PRAYER

Farewell if ever fondest prayer
For others weal availed on high
Mine will not all be lost in air
But waft thy name beyond the sky
Twere vain to speak to weep to sigh
Oh more than tears of blood can tell
When wrung from guilts expiring eye
Are in that word  Farewell  Farewell

These lips are mute these eyes are dry
But in my breast and in my brain
Awake the pangs that pass not by
The thought that neer shall sleep again
My soul nor deigns nor dares complain
Though grief and passion there rebel
I only know we loved in vain 
I only feel  Farewell  Farewell

George Gordon Byron 17881824


PORPHYRIAS LOVER

The rain set early in tonight
The sullen wind was soon awake
It tore the elmtops down for spite
And did its worst to vex the lake
I listened with heart fit to break
When glided in Porphyria straight
She shut the cold out and the storm
And kneeled and made the cheerless grate
Blaze up and all the cottage warm
Which done she rose and from her form
Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl
And laid her soiled gloves by untied
Her hat and let the damp hair fall
And last she sat down by my side
And called me When no voice replied
She put my arm about her waist
And made her smooth white shoulder bare
And all her yellow hair displaced
And stooping made my cheek lie there
And spread oer all her yellow hair
Murmuring how she loved me  she
Too weak for all her hearts endeavor
To set its struggling passion free
From pride and vainer ties dissever
And give herself to me for ever
But passion sometimes would prevail
Nor could tonights gay feast restrain
A sudden thought of one so pale
For love of her and all in vain
So she was come through wind and rain
Be sure I looked up at her eyes
Happy and proud at last I knew
Porphyria worshipped me surprise
Made my heart swell and still it grew
While I debated what to do
That moment she was mine mine fair
Perfectly pure and good I found
A thing to do and all her hair
In one long yellow string I wound
Three times her little throat around
And strangled her No pain felt she
I am quite sure she felt no pain
As a shut bud that holds a bee
I warily oped her lids again
Laughed the blue eyes without a stain
And I untightened next the tress
About her neck her cheek once more
Blushed bright beneath my burning kiss
I propped her head up as before
Only this time my shoulder bore
Her head which droops upon it still
The smiling rosy little head
So glad it has its utmost will
That all it scorned at once is fled
And I its love am gained instead
Porphyrias love she guessed not how
Her darling one wish would he heard
And thus we sit together now
And all night long we have not stirred
And yet God has not said a word

Robert Browning 18121889


MODERN BEAUTY

I am the torch she saith and what to me
If the moth die of me I am the flame
Of Beauty and I burn that all may see
Beauty and I have neither joy nor shame
But live with that clear light of perfect fire
Which is to men the death of their desire

I am Yseult and Helen I have seen
Troy burn and the most loving knight lies dead
The world has been my mirror time has been
My breath upon the glass and men have said
Age after age in rapture and despair
Loves poor few words before my image there

I live and am immortal in my eyes
The sorrow of the world and on my lips
The joy of life mingle to make me wise
Yet now the day is darkened with eclipse
Who is there lives for beauty Still am I
The torch but wheres the moth that still dares die

Arthur Symons 1865


LA BELLE DAME SANS MERCI

O what can ail thee knightatarms
Alone and palely loitering
The sedge has withered from the lake
And no birds sing

O what can ail thee knightatarms
So haggard and so woebegone
The squirrels granary is full
And the harvests done

I see a lily on thy brow
With anguish moist and feverdew
And on thy cheeks a fading rose
Fast withereth too

I met a lady in the meads
Full beautiful  a fairys child
Her hair was long her foot was light
And her eyes were wild

I made a garland for her head
And bracelets too and fragrant zone
She looked at me as she did love
And made sweet moan

I set her on my pacing steed
And nothing else saw all day long
For sidelong would she bend and sing
A fairys song

She found me roots of relish sweet
And honey wild and mannadew
And sure in language strange she said
I love thee true

She took me to her elfin grot
And there she wept and sighed full sore
And there I shut her wild wild eyes
With kisses four

And there she lulled me asleep
And there I dreamed  Ah woe betide
The latest dream I ever dreamed
On the cold hills side

I saw pale kings and princes too
Pale warriors deathpale were they all
They cried  La belle dame sans merci
Hath thee in thrall

I saw their starved lips in the gloam
With horrid warning gaped wide
And I awoke and found me here
On the cold hills side

And this is why I sojourn here
Alone and palely loitering
Though the sedge is withered from the lake
And no birds sing

John Keats 17951821


TANTALUS  TEXAS

If I may trust your love she cried
And you would have me for a bride
Ride over yonder plain and bring
Your flask full from the Mustang spring
Fly fast as western eagles wing
Oer the Llano Estacado

He heard and bowed without a word
His gallant steed he lightly spurred
He turned his face and rode away
Toward the grave of dying day
And vanished with its parting ray
On the Llano Estacado

Night came and found him riding on
Day came and still he rode alone
He spared not spur he drew not rein
Across that broad unchanging plain
Till he the Mustang spring might gain
On the Llano Estacado

A little rest a little draught
Hot from his hand and quickly quaffed
His flask was filled and then he turned
Once more his steed the maguey spurned
Once more the sky above him burned
On the Llano Estacado

How hot the quivering landscape glowed
His brain seemed boiling as he rode 
Was it a dream a drunken one
Or was he really riding on
Was that a skull that gleamed and shone
On the Llano Estacado

Brave steed of mine brave steed he cried
So often true so often tried
Bear up a little longer yet
His mouth was black with blood and sweat 
Heaven how he longed his lips to wet
On the Llano Estacado

And still within his breast he held
The precious flask so lately filled
Oh for a drink But well he knew
If empty it should meet her view
Her scorn  but still his longing grew
On the Llano Estacado

His horse went down He wandered on
Giddy blind beaten and alone
While upon cushioned couch you lie
Oh think how hard it is to die
Beneath the cruel cloudless sky
On the Llano Estacado

At last he staggered stumbled fell
His day was done he knew full well
And raising to his lips the flask
The end the object of his task
Drank to her  more she could not ask
Ah the Llano Estacado

That night in the Presidio
Beneath the torchlights wavy glow
She danced  and never thought of him
The victim of a womans whim
Lying with face upturned and grim
On the Llano Estacado

Joaquin Miller 18391913


ENCHAINMENT

I went to her who loveth me no more
And prayed her bear with me if so she might
For I had found day after day too sore
And tears that would not cease night after night
And so I prayed her weeping that she bore
To let me be with her a little yea
To soothe myself a little with her sight
Who loved me once ah many a night and day

Then she who loveth me no more maybe
She pitied somewhat and I took a chain
To bind myself to her and her to me
Yea so that I might call her mine again
Lo she forbade me not but I and she
Fettered her fair limbs and her neck more fair
Chained the fair wasted white of loves domain
And put gold fetters on her golden hair

Oh the vain joy it is to see her lie
Beside me once again beyond release
Her hair her hand her body till she die
All mine for me to do with what I please
For after all I find no chain whereby
To chain her heart to love me as before
Nor fetter for her lips to make them cease
From saying still she loveth me no more

Arthur OShaughnessy 18441881


AULD ROBIN GRAY

When the sheep are in the fauld and the kye at hame
And a the warld to rest are gane
The waes o my heart fa in showers frae my ee
While my gudeman lies sound by me

Young Jamie loed me weel and sought me for his bride
But saving a croun he had naething else beside
To make the croun a pund young Jamie gaed to sea
And the croun and the pund were baith for me

He hadna been awa a week but only twa
When my father brak his arm and the kye was stown awa
My mother she fell sick  and my Jamie at the sea 
And auld Robin Gray came acourtin me

My father couldna work and my mother couldna spin
I toiled day and night but their bread I couldna win
Auld Rob maintained them baith and wi tears in his ee
Said Jennie for their sakes O marry me

My heart it said nay I looked for Jamie back
But the wind it blew high and the ship it was a wrack
His ship it was a wrack  Why didna Jamie dee
Or why do I live to cry Waes me

My father urged me sair my mother didna speak
But she looked in my face till my heart was like to break
They gied him my hand though my heart was in the sea
Sae auld Robin Gray he was gudeman to me

I hadna been a wife a week but only four
When mournfu as I sat on the stane at the door
I saw my Jamies wraith  for I couldna think it he
Till he said Im come hame to marry thee

O sair sair did we greet and muckle did we say
We took but ae kiss and we tore ourselves away
I wish that I were dead but Im no like to dee
And why was I born to say Waes me

I gang like a ghaist and I carena to spin
I daurna think on Jamie for that wad be a sin
But Ill do my best a gude wife aye to be
For auld Robin Gray he is kind unto me

Anne Barnard 17501825


LOST LIGHT

My heart is chilled and my pulse is slow
But often and often will memory go
Like a blind child lost in a waste of snow
Back to the days when I loved you so 
The beautiful long ago

I sit here dreaming them through and through
The blissful moments I shared with you 
The sweet sweet days when our love was new
When I was trustful and you were true 
Beautiful days but few

Blest or wretched fettered or free
Why should I care how your life may be
Or whether you wander by land or sea
I only know you are dead to me
Ever and hopelessly

Oh how often at days decline
I pushed from my window the curtaining vine
To see from your lattice the lamplight shine 
Type of a message that half divine
Flashed from your heart to mine

Once more the starlight is silvering all
The roses sleep by the garden wall
The night bird warbles his madrigal
And I hear again through the sweet air fall
The evening buglecall

But summers will vanish and years will wane
And bring no light to your window pane
Nor gracious sunshine nor patient rain
Can bring dead love back to life again
I call up the past in vain

My heart is heavy my heart is old
And that proves dross which I counted gold
I watch no longer your curtains fold
The window is dark and the night is cold
And the story forever told

Elizabeth Akers 18321911


A SIGH

It was nothing but a rose I gave her 
Nothing but a rose
Any wind might rob of half its savor
Any wind that blows

When she took it from my trembling fingers
With a hand as chill 
Ah the flying touch upon them lingers
Stays and thrills them still

Withered faded pressed between the pages
Crumpled fold on fold 
Once it lay upon her breast and ages
Cannot make it old

Harriet Prescott Spofford 18351921


HEREAFTER

Love when all the years are silent vanished quite and laid to rest
When you and I are sleeping folded breathless breast to breast
When no morrow is before us and the long grass tosses oer us
And our grave remains forgotten or by alien footsteps pressed 

Still that love of ours will linger that great love enrich the earth
Sunshine in the heavenly azure breezes blowing joyous mirth
Fragrance fanning off from flowers melody of summer showers
Sparkle of the spicy woodfires round the happy autumn hearth

Thats our love But you and I dear  shall we linger with it yet
Mingled in one dewdrop tangled in one sunbeams golden net 
On the violets purple bosom I the sheen but you the blossom
Stream on sunset winds and be the haze with which some hill is wet

Or beloved  if ascending  when we have endowed the world
With the best bloom of our being whither will our way be whirled
Through what vast and starry spaces toward what awful holy places
With a white light on our faces spirit over spirit furled

Only this our yearning answers wheresoeer that way defile
Not a film shall part us through the eons of that mighty while
In the fair eternal weather even as phantoms still together
Floating floating one forever in the light of Gods great smile

Harriet Prescott Spofford 18351921


ENDYMION

The apple trees are hung with gold
And birds are loud in Arcady
The sheep lie bleating in the fold
The wild goat runs across the wold
But yesterday his love he told
I know he will come back to me
O rising moon O Lady moon
Be you my lovers sentinel
You cannot choose but know him well
For he is shod with purple shoon
You cannot choose but know my love
For he a shepherds crook doth bear
And he is soft as any dove
And brown and curly is his hair

The turtle now has ceased to call
Upon her crimsonfooted groom
The gray wolf prowls about the stall
The lilys singing seneschal
Sleeps in the lilybell and all
The violet hills are lost in gloom
O risen moon O holy moon
Stand on the top of Helice
And if my own true love you see
Ah if you see the purple shoon
The hazel crook the lads brown hair
The goatskin wrapped about his arm
Tell him that I am waiting where
The rushlight glimmers in the Farm

The falling dew is cold and chill
And no bird sings in Arcady
The little fauns have left the hill
Even the tired daffodil
Has closed its gilded doors and still
My lover comes not back to me
False moon False moon O waning moon
Where is my own true lover gone
Where are the lips vermilion
The shepherds crook the purple shoon
Why spread that silver pavilion
Why wear that veil of drifting mist
Ah thou hast young Endymion
Thou hast the lips that should be kissed

Oscar Wilde 18561900


LOVE IS A TERRIBLE THING

I went out to the farthest meadow
I lay down in the deepest shadow

And I said unto the earth Hold me
And unto the night O enfold me

And unto the wind petulantly
I cried You know not for you are free

And I begged the little leaves to lean
Low and together for a safe screen

Then to the stars I told my tale
That is my homelight there in the vale

And O I know that I shall return
But let me lie first mid the unfeeling fern

For there is a flame that has blown too near
And there is a name that has grown too dear
And there is a fear    

And to the still hills and cool earth and far sky I made moan
The heart in my bosom is not my own

O would I were free as the wind on wing
Love is a terrible thing

Grace Fallow Norton 1876


THE BALLAD OF THE ANGEL

Who is it knocking in the night
That fain would enter in
The ghost of Lost Delight am I
The sin you would not sin
Who comes to look in your two eyes
And see what might have been

Oh long ago and long ago
I cast you forth he said
For that your eyes were all too blue
Your laughing mouth too red
And my torn soul was tangled in
The tresses of your head

Now mind you with what bitter words
You cast me forth from you
I bade you back to that fair Hell
From whence your breath you drew
And with great blows I broke my heart
Lest it might follow too

Yea from the grasp of your white hands
I freed my hands that day
And have I not climbed near to God
As these His henchmen may
Ah man  ah man twas my two hands
That led you all the way

I hid my eyes from your two eyes
That they might see aright
Yet think you twas a star that led
Your feet from height to height
It was the flame of my two eyes
That drew you through the night

With trembling hands he threw the door
Then fell upon his knee
O Vision armed and cloaked in light
Why do you honor me
The Angel of your Strength am I
Who was your sin quoth she

For that you slew me long ago
My hands have raised you high
For that mine eyes you closed mine eyes
Are lights to lead you by
And tis my touch shall swing the gates
Of Heaven when you die

Theodosia Garrison 1874


LOVE CAME BACK AT FALL O DEW

Love came back at fall o dew
Playing his old part
But I had a word or two
That would break his heart

He who comes at candlelight
That should come before
Must betake him to the night
From a barred door

This the word that made us part
In the fall o dew
This the word that brake his heart 
Yet it brake mine too

Lizette Woodworth Reese 18561935


I SHALL NOT CARE

When I am dead and over me bright April
Shakes out her raindrenched hair
Though you should lean above me brokenhearted
I shall not care

I shall have peace as leafy trees are peaceful
When rain bends down the bough
And I shall be more silent and coldhearted
Than you are now

Sara Teasdale 18841933


OUTGROWN

Nay you wrong her my friend shes not fickle her love
 she has simply outgrown
One can read the whole matter translating her heart
 by the light of ones own

Can you bear me to talk with you frankly There is much that
 my heart would say
And you know we were children together have quarreled
 and made up in play

And so for the sake of old friendship I venture to tell you
 the truth 
As plainly perhaps and as bluntly as I might in our
 earlier youth

Five summers ago when you wooed her you stood on the
 selfsame plane
Face to face heart to heart never dreaming your souls
 should be parted again

She loved you at that time entirely in the bloom of her lifes
 early May
And it is not her fault I repeat it that she does not love you
 today

Nature never stands still nor souls either they ever go up
 or go down
And hers has been steadily soaring  but how has it been
 with your own

She has struggled and yearned and aspired grown purer and wiser each year
The stars are not farther above you in yon luminous atmosphere

For she whom you crowned with fresh roses down yonder five summers ago
Has learned that the first of our duties to God and ourselves is to grow

Her eyes they are sweeter and calmer but their vision is clearer as well
Her voice has a tender cadence but is pure as a silver bell

Her face has the look worn by those who with God and his angels have talked
The white robes she wears are less white than the spirits with whom she has walked

And you Have you aimed at the highest Have you too
 aspired and prayed
Have you looked upon evil unsullied Have you conquered it
 undismayed

Have you too grown purer and wiser as the months
 and the years have rolled on
Did you meet her this morning rejoicing in the triumph
 of victory won

Nay hear me The truth cannot harm you When today
 in her presence you stood
Was the hand that you gave her as white and clean as that
 of her womanhood

Go measure yourself by her standard look back on the years
 that have fled
Then ask if you need why she tells you that the love of her
 girlhood is dead

She cannot look down to her lover her love like her soul aspires
He must stand by her side or above her who would kindle its
 holy fires

Now farewell For the sake of old friendship I have ventured
 to tell you the truth
As plainly perhaps and as bluntly as I might in our earlier youth

Julia C R Dorr 18251913


A TRAGEDY

Among his books he sits all day
To think and read and write
He does not smell the newmown hay
The roses red and white

I walk among them all alone
His silly stupid wife
The world seems tasteless dead and done 
An empty thing is life

At night his window casts a square
Of light upon the lawn
I sometimes walk and watch it there
Until the chill of dawn

I have no brain to understand
The books he loves to read
I only have a heart and hand
He does not seem to need

He calls me Child  lays on my hair
Thin fingers cold and mild
Oh God of Love who answers prayer
I wish I were a child

And no one sees and no one knows
He least would know or see
That ere Love gathers next years rose
Death will have gathered me

Edith Nesbit 18581924


LEFT BEHIND

It was the autumn of the year
The strawberryleaves were red and sere
Octobers airs were fresh and chill
When pausing on the windy hill
The hill that overlooks the sea
You talked confidingly to me 
Me whom your keen artistic sight
Has not yet learned to read aright
Since I have veiled my heart from you
And loved you better than you knew

You told me of your toilsome past
The tardy honors won at last
The trials borne the conquests gained
The longedfor boon of Fame attained
I knew that every victory
But lifted you away from me
That every step of high emprise
But left me lowlier in your eyes
I watched the distance as it grew
And loved you better than you knew

You did not see the bitter trace
Of anguish sweep across my face
You did not hear my proud heart beat
Heavy and slow beneath your feet
You thought of triumphs still unwon
Of glorious deeds as yet undone
And I the while you talked to me
I watched the gulls float lonesomely
Till lost amid the hungry blue
And loved you better than you knew

You walk the sunny side of fate
The wise world smiles and calls you great
The golden fruitage of success
Drops at your feet in plenteousness
And you have blessings manifold 
Renown and power and friends and gold 
They build a wall between us twain
Which may not be thrown down again
Alas for I the long years through
Have loved you better than you knew

Your lifes proud aim your arts high truth
Have kept the promise of your youth
And while you won the crown which now
Breaks into bloom upon your brow
My soul cried strongly out to you
Across the oceans yearning blue
While unremembered and afar
I watched you as I watch a star
Through darkness struggling into view
And loved you better than you knew

I used to dream in all these years
Of patient faith and silent tears
That Loves strong hand would put aside
The barriers of place and pride
Would reach the pathless darkness through
And draw me softly up to you
But that is past If you should stray
Beside my grave some future day
Perchance the violets oer my dust
Will half betray their buried trust
And say their blue eyes full of dew
She loved you better than you knew

Elizabeth Akers 18321911


THE FORSAKEN MERMAN

Come dear children let us away
Down and away below
Now my brothers call from the bay
Now the great winds shoreward blow
Now the salt tides seaward flow
Now the wild white horses play
Champ and chafe and toss in the spray
Children dear let us away
This way this way

Call her once before you go 
Call once yet
In a voice that she will know
Margaret Margaret
Childrens voices should be dear
Call once more to a mothers ear
Childrens voices wild with pain 
Surely she will come again
Call her once and come away
This way this way
Mother dear we cannot stay
The wild white horses foam and fret
Margaret Margaret

Come dear children come away down
Call no more
One last look at the whitewalled town
And the little gray church on the windy shore
Then come down
She will not come though you call all day
Come away come away

Children dear was it yesterday
We heard the sweet bells over the bay
In the caverns where we lay
Through the surf and through the swell
The faroff sound of a silver bell
Sandstrewn caverns cool and deep
Where the winds are all asleep
Where the spent lights quiver and gleam
Where the salt weed sways in the stream
Where the seabeasts ranged all round
Feed in the ooze of their pastureground
Where the seasnakes coil and twine
Dry their mail and bask in the brine
Where great whales come sailing by
Sail and sail with unshut eye
Round the world for ever and aye
When did music come this way
Children dear was it yesterday

Children dear was it yesterday
Call yet once that she went away
Once she sate with you and me
On a red gold throne in the heart of the sea
And the youngest sate on her knee
She combed its bright hair and she tended it well
When down swung the sound of the faroff bell
She sighed she looked up through the clear green sea
She said I must go for my kinsfolk pray
In the little gray church on the shore today
Twill he Eastertime in the world  ah me
And I lose my poor soul Merman here with thee
I said Go up dear heart through the waves
Say thy prayer and come back to the kind seacaves
She smiled she went up through the surf in the bay
Children dear was it yesterday

Children dear were we long alone
The sea grows stormy the little ones moan
Long prayers I said in the world they say
Come I said and we rose through the surf in the bay
We went up the beach by the sandy down
Where the seastocks bloom to the whitewalled town
Through the narrow paved streets where all was still
To the little gray church on the windy hill
From the church came a murmur of folk at their prayers
But we stood without in the cold blowing airs
We climbed on the graves on the stones worn with rains
And we gazed up the aisle through the small leaded panes
She sate by the pillar we saw her clear
Margaret hist come quick we are here
Dear heart I said we are long alone
The sea grows stormy the little ones moan
But ah she gave me never a look
For her eyes were sealed to the holy book
Loud prays the priest shut stands the door
Come away children call no more
Come away come down call no more

Down down down
Down to the depths of the sea
She sits at her wheel in the humming town
Singing most joyfully
Hark what she sings O joy O joy
From the humming street and the child with its toy
From the priest and the bell and the holy well
From the wheel where I spun
And the blessed light of the sun
And so she sings her fill
Singing most joyfully
Till the spindle drops from her hand
And the whizzing wheel stands still
She steals to the window and looks at the sand
And over the sand at the sea
And her eyes are set in a stare
And anon there breaks a sigh
And anon there drops a tear
From a sorrowclouded eye
And a heart sorrowladen
A long long sigh
For the cold strange eyes of a little Mermaiden
And the gleam of her golden hair

Come away away children
Come children come down
The hoarse wind blows colder
Lights shine in the town
She will start from her slumber
When gusts shake the door
She will hear the winds howling
Will hear the waves roar
We shall see while above us
The waves roar and whirl
A ceiling of amber
A pavement of pearl
Singing Here came a mortal
But faithless was she
And alone dwell for ever
The kings of the sea

But children at midnight
When soft the winds blow
When clear falls the moonlight
When springtides are low
When sweet airs come seaward
From heaths starred with broom
And high rocks throw mildly
On the blanched sands a gloom
Up the still glistening beaches
Up the creeks we will hie
Over banks of bright seaweed
The ebbtide leaves dry
We will gaze from the sandhills
At the white sleeping town
At the church on the hillside 
And then come back down
Singing There dwells a loved one
But cruel is she
She left lonely for ever
The kings of the sea

Matthew Arnold 18221888


THE PORTRAIT

Midnight past Not a sound of aught
Through the silent house but the wind at his prayers
I sat by the dying fire and thought
Of the dear dead woman upstairs

A night of tears for the gusty rain
Had ceased but the eaves were dripping yet
And the moon looked forth as though in pain
With her face all white and wet

Nobody with me my watch to keep
But the friend of my bosom the man I love
And grief had sent him fast to sleep
In the chamber up above

Nobody else in the country place
All round that knew of my loss beside
But the good young Priest with the Raphaelface
Who confessed her when she died

That good young Priest is of gentle nerve
And my grief had moved him beyond control
For his lip grew white as I could observe
When he speeded her parting soul

I sat by the dreary hearth alone
I thought of the pleasant days of yore
I said The staff of my life is gone
The woman I loved is no more

On her cold dead bosom my portrait lies
Which next to her heart she used to wear 
Haunting it oer with her tender eyes
When my own face was not there

It is set all round with rubies red
And pearls which a Pen might have kept
For each ruby there my heart hath bled
For each pearl my eyes have wept

And I said  The thing is precious to me
They will bury her soon in the churchyard clay
It lies on her heart and lost must be
If I do not take it away

I lighted my lamp at the dying flame
And crept up the stairs that creaked for fright
Till into the chamber of death I came
Where she lay all in white

The moon shone over her windingsheet
There stark she lay on her carven bed
Seven burning tapers about her feet
And seven about her head

As I stretched my hand I held my breath
I turned as I drew the curtains apart
I dared not look on the face of death
I knew where to find her heart

I thought at first as my touch fell there
It had warmed that heart to life with love
For the thing I touched was warm I swear
And I could feel it move

Twas the hand of a man that was moving slow
Oer the heart of the dead  from the other side
And at once the sweat broke over my brow
Who is robbing the corpse I cried

Opposite me by the tapers light
The friend of my bosom the man I loved
Stood over the corpse and all as white
And neither of us moved

What do you here my friend  The man
Looked first at me and then at the dead
There is a portrait here he began
There is It is mine I said

Said the friend of my bosom Yours no doubt
The portrait was till a month ago
When this suffering angel took that out
And placed mine there I know

This woman she loved me well said I
A month ago said my friend to me
And in your throat I groaned you lie
He answered    Let us see

Enough I returned let the dead decide
And whosesoever the portrait prove
His shall it be when the cause is tried
Where Death is arraigned by Love

We found the portrait there in its place
We opened it by the tapers shine
The gems were all unchanged the face
Was  neither his nor mine

One nail drives out another at least
The face of the portrait there I cried
Is our friends the Raphaelfaced young Priest
Who confessed her when she died

The setting is all of rubies red
And pearls which a Peri might have kept
For each ruby there my heart hath bled
For each pearl my eyes have wept

Edward Robert Bulwer Lytton 18311891


THE ROSE AND THORN

Shes loveliest of the festal throng
In delicate form and Grecian face 
A beautiful incarnate song
A marvel of harmonious grace
And yet I know the truth I speak
From those gay groups she stands apart
A rose upon her tender cheek
A thorn within her heart

Though bright her eyes bewildering gleams
Fair tremulous lips and shining hair
A something born of mournful dreams
Breathes round her sad enchanted air
No blithesome thoughts at hide and seek
From out her dimples smiling start
If still the rose be on her cheek
A thorn is in her heart

Young lover tossed twixt hope and fear
Your whispered vow and yearning eyes
Yon marble Clytie pillared near
Could move as soon to soft replies
Or if she thrill at words you speak
Loves memory prompts the sudden start
The rose has paled upon her cheek
The thorn has pierced her heart

Paul Hamilton Hayne 18301886


TO HER  UNSPOKEN

Go to him ah go to him and lift your eyes aglow to him
Fear not royally to give whatever he may claim
All your spirits treasury scruple not to show to him
He is noble meet him with a pride too high for shame

Say to him ah say to him that soul and body sway to him
Cast away the cowardice that counsels you to flight
Lest you turn at last to find that you have lost the way to him
Lest you stretch your arms in vain across a starless night

Be to him ah be to him the key that sets joy free to him
Teach him all the tenderness that only love can know
And if ever there should come a memory of me to him
Bid him judge me gently for the sake of long ago

Amelia Josephine Burr 1878


A LIGHT WOMAN

So far as our story approaches the end
Which do you pity the most of us three 
My friend or the mistress of my friend
With her wanton eyes or me

My friend was already too good to lose
And seemed in the way of improvement yet
When she crossed his path with her huntingnoose
And over him drew her net

When I saw him tangled in her toils
A shame said I if she adds just him
To her nineandninety other spoils
The hundredth for a whim

And before my friend be wholly hers
How easy to prove to him I said
An eagles the game her pride prefers
Though she snaps at a wren instead

So I gave her eyes my own eyes to take
My hand sought hers as in earnest need
And round she turned for my noble sake
And gave me herself indeed

The eagle am I with my fame in the world
The wren is he with his maiden face
 You look away and your lip is curled
Patience a moments space

For see my friend goes shaking and white
He eyes me as the basilisk
I have turned it appears his day to night
Eclipsing his suns disk

And I did it he thinks as a very thief
Though I love her  that he comprehends 
One should master ones passions love in chief
And be loyal to ones friends

And she  she lies in my hand as tame
As a pear late basking over a wall
Just a touch to try and off it came
Tis mine  can I let it fall

With no mind to eat it thats the worst
Were it thrown in the road would the case assist
Twas quenching a dozen blueflies thirst
When I gave its stalk a twist

And I  what I seem to my friend you see
What I soon shall seem to his love you guess
What I seem to myself do you ask of me
No hero I confess

Tis an awkward thing to play with souls
And matter enough to save ones own
Yet think of my friend and the burning coals
He played with for bits of stone

One likes to show the truth for the truth
That the woman was light is very true
But suppose she says  Never mind that youth
What wrong have I done to you

Well anyhow here the story stays
So far at least as I understand
And Robert Browning you writer of plays
Heres a subject made to your hand

Robert Browning 18121889


FROM THE TURKISH

The chain I gave was fair to view
The lute I added sweet in sound
The heart that offered both was true
And ill deserved the fate it found

These gifts were charmed by secret spell
Thy truth in absence to divine
And they have done their duty well
Alas they could not teach thee thine

That chain was firm in every link
But not to bear a strangers touch
That lute was sweet  till thou couldst think
In other hands its notes were such

Let him who from thy neck unbound
The chain which shivered in his grasp
Who saw that lute refuse to sound
Restring the chords renew the clasp

When thou wert changed they altered too
The chain is broke the music mute
Tis past  to them and thee adieu 
False heart frail chain and silent lute

George Gordon Byron 17881824


A SUMMER WOOING

The wind went wooing the rose
For the rose was fair
How the rough wind won her who knows
But he left her there
Far away from her grave he blows
Does the free wind care

Louise Chandler Moulton 18351908


BUTTERFLIES

At sixteen years she knew no care
How could she sweet and pure as light
And there pursued her everywhere
Butterflies all white

A lover looked She dropped her eyes
That glowed like pansies wet with dew
And lo there came from out the skies
Butterflies all blue

Before she guessed her heart was gone
The tale of love was swiftly told
And all about her wheeled and shone
Butterflies all gold

Then he forsook her one sad morn
She wept and sobbed Oh love come back
There only came to her forlorn
Butterflies all black

John Davidson 18571909


UNSEEN SPIRITS

The shadows lay along Broadway
Twas near the twilighttide
And slowly there a lady fair
Was walking in her pride
Alone walked she but viewlessly
Walked spirits at her side

Peace charmed the street beneath her feet
And Honor charmed the air
And all astir looked kind on her
And called her good as fair 
For all God ever gave to her
She kept with chary care

She kept with care her beauties rare
From lovers warm and true
For her heart was cold to all but gold
And the rich came not to woo 
But honored well are charms to sell
If priests the selling do

Now walking there was one more fair 
A slight girl lilypale
And she had unseen company
To make the spirit quail
Twixt Want and Scorn she walked forlorn
And nothing could avail

No mercy now can clear her brow
For this worlds peace to pray
For as loves wild prayer dissolved in air
Her womans heart gave way 
But the sin forgiven by Christ in heaven
By man is cursed alway

Nathaniel Parker Willis 18061867


GRANDMITHER THINK NOT I FORGET

Grandmither think not I forget when I come back to town
An wander the old ways again an tread them up and down
I never smell the clover bloom nor see the swallows pass
Without I mind how good ye were unto a little lass
I never hear the winter rain apelting all night through
Without I think and mind me of how cold it falls on you
And if I come not often to your bed beneath the thyme
Mayhap tis that Id change wi ye and gie my bed for thine
Would like to sleep in thine

I never hear the summer winds among the roses blow
Without I wonder why it was ye loved the lassie so
Ye gave me cakes and lollipops and pretty toys a store 
I never thought I should come back and ask ye now for more
Grandmither gie me your still white hands that lie upon your breast
For mine do beat the dark all night and never find me rest
They grope among the shadows an they beat the cold black air
They go seekin in the darkness an they never find him there
They never find him there

Grandmither gie me your sightless eyes that I may never see
His own aburnin full o love that must not shine for me
Grandmither gie me your peaceful lips white as the kirkyard snow
For mine be tremblin wi the wish that he must never know
Grandmither gie me your claystopped ears that I may never hear
My lad asingin in the night when I am sick wi fear
Asingin when the moonlight over a the land is white 
Ah God Ill up an go to him asingin in the night
Acallin in the night

Grandmither gie me your claycold heart that has forgot to ache
For mine be fire within my breast and yet it cannot break
Wi every beat its callin for things that must not be 
An can ye not let me creep in an rest awhile by ye
A little lass afeard o dark slept by ye years agone 
Ah she has found what night can hold twixt sundown an the dawn
So when I plant the rose an rue above your grave for ye
Yell know its under rue an rose that I would like to be
That I would like to be

Willa Sibert Cather 1875


LITTLE WILD BABY

Through the fierce fever I nursed him and then he said
I was the woman  I  that he would wed
He sent a boat with men for his own white priest
And he gave my father horses and made a feast
I am his wife if he has forgotten me
I will not live for scorning eyes to see
Little wild baby that knowest not where thou art going
Lie still lie still Thy mother will do the rowing

Three moons ago  it was but three moons ago 
He took his gun and started across the snow
For the river was frozen the river that still goes down
Every day as I watch it to find the town
The town whose name I caught from his sleeping lips
A place of many people and many ships
Little wild baby that knowest not where thou art going
Lie still lie still Thy mother will do the rowing

I to that town am going to search the place
With his little white son in my arms till I see his face
Only once shall I need to look in his eyes
To see if his soul as I knew it lives or dies
If it lives we live and if it is dead we die
And the soul of my baby will never ask me why
Little wild baby that knowest not where thou art going
Lie still lie still Thy mother will do the rowing

I have asked about the river one answered me
That after the town it goes to find the sea
That great waves able to break the stoutest bark
Are there and the sea is very deep and dark
If he is happy without me so best so best
I will take his baby and go away to my rest
Little wild baby that knowest not where thou art going
Lie still lie still Thy mother will do the rowing
The river flows swiftly the sea is dark and deep
Little wild baby lie still Lie still and sleep

Margaret Thomson Janvier 18451913


A CRADLE SONG

Come little babe come silly soul
Thy fathers shame thy mothers grief
Born as I doubt to all our dole
And to thyself unhappy chief
Sing lullaby and lap it warm
Poor soul that thinks no creature harm

Thou little thinkst and less dost know
The cause of this thy mothers moan
Thou wantst the wit to wail her woe
And I myself am all alone
Why dost thou weep why dost thou wail
And knowst not yet what thou dost ail

Come little wretch  ah silly heart
Mine only joy what can I more
If there be any wrong thy smart
That may the destinies implore
Twas I I say against my will
I wail the time but be thou still

And dost thou smile O thy sweet face
Would God Himself He might thee see 
No doubt thou wouldst soon purchase grace
I know right well for thee and me
But come to mother babe and play
For father false is fled away

Sweet boy if it by fortune chance
Thy father home again to send
If death do strike me with his lance
Yet mayst thou me to him commend
If any ask thy mothers name
Tell how by love she purchased blame

Then will his gentle heart soon yield
I know him of a noble mind
Although a lion in the field
A lamb in town thou shalt him find
Ask blessing babe be not afraid
His sugared words hath me betrayed

Then mayst thou joy and be right glad
Although in woe I seem to moan
Thy father is no rascal lad
A noble youth of blood and bone
His glancing looks if he once smile
Right honest women may beguile

Come little boy and rock asleep
Sing lullaby and be thou still
I that can do naught else but weep
Will sit by thee and wail my fill
God bless my babe and lullaby
From this thy fathers quality

Nicholas Breton 15451626


LADY ANNE BOTHWELLS LAMENT

Balow my babe lie still and sleep
It grieves me sore to see thee weep
Wouldst thou be quiet Ise be glad
Thy mourning makes my sorrow sad
Balow my boy thy mothers joy
Thy father breeds me great annoy 
Balow lalow

When he began to court my love
And with his sugared words me move
His feignings false and flattering cheer
To me that time did not appear
But now I see most cruelly
He cares ne for my babe nor me 
Balow lalow

Lie still my darling sleep awhile
And when thou wakst thoull sweetly smile
But smile not as thy father did
To cozen maids nay God forbid
But yet I fear thou wilt go near
Thy fathers heart and face to bear 
Balow lalow

I cannot choose but ever will
Be loving to thy father still
Whereer he go whereer he ride
My love with him doth still abide
In weal or woe whereer he go
My heart shall neer depart him fro 
Balow lalow

But do not do not pretty mine
To feignings false thy heart incline
Be loyal to thy lover true
And never change her for a new
If good or fair of her have care
For womens bannings wondrous sair 
Balow lalow

Bairn by thy face I will beware
Like Sirens words Ill come not near
My babe and I together will live
Hell comfort me when cares do grieve
My babe and I right soft will lie
And neer respect mans cruelty 
Balow lalow

Farewell farewell the falsest youth
That ever kissed a womans mouth
I wish all maids be warned by me
Never to trust mans courtesy
For if we do but chance to bow
Theyll use us then they care not how 
Balow lalow

A WOMANS LOVE

A sentinel angel sitting high in glory
Heard this shrill wail ring out from Purgatory
Have mercy mighty angel hear my story

I loved  and blind with passionate love I fell
Love brought me down to death and death to Hell
For God is just and death for sin is well

I do not rage against His high decree
Nor for myself do ask that grace shall be
But for my love on earth who mourns for me

Great Spirit Let me see my love again
And comfort him one hour and I were fain
To pay a thousand years of fire and pain

Then said the pitying angel Nay repent
That wild vow Look the dialfingers bent
Down to the last hour of thy punishment

But still she wailed I pray thee let me go
I cannot rise to peace and leave him so
O let me soothe him in his bitter woe

The brazen gates ground sullenly ajar
And upwards joyous like a rising star
She rose and vanished in the ether far

But soon adown the dying sunset sailing
And like a wounded bird her pinions trailing
She fluttered back with brokenhearted wailing

She sobbed I found him by the summer sea
Reclined his head upon a maidens knee 
She curled his hair and kissed him Woe is me

She wept Now let my punishment begin
I have been fond and foolish Let me in
To expiate my sorrow and my sin

The angel answered Nay sad soul go higher
To be deceived in your true hearts desire
Was bitterer than a thousand years of fire

John Hay 18381905


A TRAGEDY

She was only a woman famished for loving
Mad with devotion and such slight things
And he was a very great musician
And used to finger his fiddlestrings

Her hearts sweet gamut is cracking and breaking
For a look for a touch  for such slight things
But hes such a very great musician
Grimacing and fingering his fiddlestrings

Theophile Marzials 1850


MOTHER I CANNOT MIND MY WHEEL

Mother I cannot mind my wheel
My fingers ache my lips are dry
O if you felt the pain I feel
But O who ever felt as I

No longer could I doubt him true 
All other men may use deceit
He always said my eyes were blue
And often swore my lips were sweet

Walter Savage Lander 17751864


AIRLY BEACON

Airly Beacon Airly Beacon
O the pleasant sight to see
Shires and towns from Airly Beacon
While my love climbed up to me

Airly Beacon Airly Beacon
O the happy hours we lay
Deep in fern on Airly Beacon
Courting through the summers day

Airly Beacon Airly Beacon
O the weary haunt for me
All alone on Airly Beacon
With his baby on my knee

Charles Kingsley 18191875


A SEA CHILD

The lover of child Marjory
Had one white hour of life brim full
Now the old nurse the rocking sea
Hath him to lull

The daughter of child Marjory
Hath in her veins to beat and run
The glad indomitable sea
The strong white sun

Bliss Carmen 18611929


FROM THE HARBOR HILL

Is it a sail she asked
No I said
Only a white seagull with its pinions spread

Is it a spar she asked
No said I
Only the slender lighthouse tower against the sky

Flutters a pennant there
No I said
Only a shred of cloud in the sunset red

Surely a hull a hull
Where I cried
Only a rock halfbared by the ebbing tide

Wait you a ship I asked
Aye quoth she
The Harbor Belle her mate comes home to marry me

Surely the good ship hath
Met no harm
Was it the west wind wailed or the babe on her arm

The Harbor Belle she urged
Naught said I 
For I knew oer the grave o the Harbor Belle the seagulls fly

Gustav Kobbe 18571918


ALLAN WATER

On the banks of Allan Water
When the sweet springtime did fall
Was the millers lovely daughter
Fairest of them all

For his bride a soldier sought her
And a winning tongue had he
On the banks of Allan Water
None so gay as she

On the banks of Allan Water
When brown autumn spread his store
There I saw the millers daughter
But she smiled no more

For the summer grief had brought her
And the soldier false was he
On the banks of Allan Water
None so sad as she

On the banks of Allan Water
When the winter snow fell fast
Still was seen the millers daughter
Chilling blew the blast

But the millers lovely daughter
Both from cold and care was free
On the banks of Allan Water
There a corse lay she

Matthew Gregory Lewis 17751818


FORSAKEN

O waly waly up the bank
And waly waly down the brae
And waly waly yon burnside
Where I and my Love wont to gae
I leaned my back unto an aik
I thought it was a trusty tree
But first it bowed and syne it brak
Sae my true Love did lichtly me

O waly waly but love be bonny
A little while when it is new
But when tis auld it waxeth cauld
And fades awa like morning dew
O wherefore should I busk my head
Or wherefore should I kame my hair
For my true Love has me forsook
And says hell never loe me mair

Now Arthurseat sall be my bed
The sheets shall neer be pressed by me
Saint Antons well sall be my drink
Since my true Love has forsaken me
Martinmas wind when wilt thou blaw
And shake the green leaves aff the tree
O gentle Death when wilt thou come
For of my life I am wearie

Tis not the frost that freezes fell
Nor blawing snaws inclemencie
Tis not sic cauld that makes me cry
But my Loves heart grown cauld to me
When we cam in by Glasgow town
We were a comely sight to see
My Love was clad in black velvet
And I mysel in cramasie

But had I wist before I kissed
That love had been sae ill to win
I had locked my heart in a case of gowd
And pinned it with a siller pin
And O if my young babe were born
And sat upon the nurses knee
And I mysel were dead and gane
And the green grass growing over me

BONNIE DOON

Ye banks and braes o bonnie Doon
How can ye bloom sae fair
How can ye chant ye little birds
And I sae fu o care

Thoull break my heart thou bonnie bird
That sings upon the bough
Thou minds me o the happy days
When my fause Luve was true

Thoull break my heart thou bonnie bird
That sings beside thy mate
For sae I sat and sae I sang
And wist na o my fate

Aft hae I roved by bonnie Doon
To see the woodbine twine
And ilka bird sang o its love
And sae did I o mine

Wi lightsome heart I pud a rose
Frae aff its thorny tree
And my fause luver staw the rose
But left the thorn wi me

Robert Burns 17591796


THE TWO LOVERS

The lover of her body said
She is more beautiful than night 
But like the kisses of the dead
Is my despair and my delight

The lover of her soul replied
She is more wonderful than death 
But bitter as the aching tide
Is all the speech of love she saith

The lover of her body said
To know one secret of her heart
For all the joy that I have had
Is past the reach of all my art

The lover of her soul replied
The secrets of her heart are mine 
Save how she lives a riven bride
Between the dust and the divine

The lover of her body sware
Though she should hate me wit you well
Rather than yield one kiss of her
I give my soul to burn in hell

The lover of her soul cried out
Rather than leave her to your greed
I would that I were walled about
With death  and death were death indeed

The lover of her body wept
And got no good of all his gain
Knowing that in her heart she kept
The penance of the others pain

The lover of her soul went mad
But when he did himself to death
Despite of all the woe he had
He smiled as one who vanquisheth

Richard Hovey 18641900


THE VAMPIRE
As suggested By The Painting By Philip BurneJones

A fool there was and he made his prayer
Even as you and I
To a rag and a bone and a hank of hair
We called her the woman who did not care
But the fool he called her his lady fair
Even as you and I

Oh the years we waste and the tears we waste
And the work of our head and hand
Belong to the woman who did not know
And now we know that she never could know
And did not understand

A fool there was and his goods he spent
Even as you and I
Honor and faith and a sure intent
And it wasnt the least what the lady meant
But a fool must follow his natural bent
Even as you and I

Oh the toil we lost and the spoil we lost
And the excellent things we planned
Belong to the woman who didnt know why
And now we know she never knew why
And did not understand

The fool was stripped to his foolish hide
Even as you and I
Which she might have seen when she threw him aside 
But it isnt on record the lady tried
So some of him lived but the most of him died 
Even as you and I

And it isnt the shame and it isnt the blame
That stings like a whitehot brand
Its coming to know that she never knew why
Seeing at last she could never know why
And never could understand

Rudyard Kipling 18651936


AGATHA

She wanders in the April woods
That glisten with the fallen shower
She leans her face against the buds
She stops she stoops she plucks a flower
She feels the ferment of the hour
She broodeth when the ringdove broods
The sun and flying clouds have power
Upon her cheek and changing moods
She cannot think she is alone
As oer her senses warmly steal
Floods of unrest she fears to own
And almost dreads to feel

Along the summer woodlands wide
Anew she roams no more alone
The joy she feared is at her side
Springs blushing secret now is known
The thrushs ringing note hath died
But glancing eye and glowing tone
Fall on her from her god her guide
She knows not asks not what the goal
She only feels she moves towards bliss
And yields her pure unquestioning soul
To touch and fondling kiss

And still she haunts those woodland ways
Though all fond fancy finds there now
To mind of spring or summer days
Are sodden trunk and songless bough
The past sits widowed on her brow
Homeward she wends with wintry gaze
To walls that house a hollow vow
To hearth where love hath ceased to blaze
Watches the clammy twilight wane
With grief too fixed for woe or tear
And with her forehead gainst the pane
Envies the dying year

Alfred Austin 18351913


A ROSE WILL FADE

You were always a dreamer Rose  red Rose
As you swung on your perfumed spray
Swinging and all the world was true
Swaying what did it trouble you
A rose will fade in a day

Why did you smile to his face red Rose
As he whistled across your way
And all the world went mad for you
All the world it knelt to woo
A rose will bloom in a day

I gather your petals Rose  red Rose
The petals he threw away
And all the world derided you
Ah the world how well it knew
A rose will fade in a day

Dora Sigerson Shorter 18621918


AFFAIRE DAMOUR

One pale November day
Flying Summer paused
They say
And growing bolder
Oer rosy shoulder
Threw her lover such a glance
That Autumns heart began to dance
O happy lover

A leafless peachtree bold
Thought for him she smiled
Im told
And stirred by love
His sleeping sap did move
Decking each naked branch with green
To show her that her look was seen
Alas poor lover

But Summer laughing fled
Nor knew he loved her
Tis said
The peachtree sighed
And soon he gladly died
And Autumn weary of the chase
Came on at Winters sober pace
O careless lover

Margaret Deland 1857


A CASUAL SONG

She sang of lovers met to play
Under the may bloom under the may
But when I sought her face so fair
I found the set face of Despair

She sang of woodland leaves in spring
And joy of young love dallying
But her young eyes were all one moan
And Death weighed on her heart like stone

I could not ask I know not now
The story of that mournful brow
It haunts me as it haunted then
A flash from fire of hellbound men

Roden Noel 18341894


THE WAY OF IT

The wind is awake pretty leaves pretty leaves
Heed not what he says he deceives he deceives
Over and over
To the lowly clover
He has lisped the same love and forgotten it too
He will soon be lisping and pledging to you

The boy is abroad pretty maid pretty maid
Beware his soft words Im afraid Im afraid
He has said them before
Times many a score
Ay he died for a dozen ere his beard pricked through
And the very same death he will die for you

The way of the boy is the way of the wind
As light as the leaves is dainty maidkind
One to deceive
And one to believe 
That is the way of it year to year
But I know you will learn it too late my dear

John Vance Cheney 18481922


WHEN LOVELY WOMAN STOOPS TO FOLLY
From The Vicar of Wakefield

When lovely woman stoops to folly
And finds too late that men betray 
What charm can soothe her melancholy
What art can wash her guilt away

The only art her guilt to cover
To hide her shame from every eye
To give repentance to her lover
And wring his bosom is  to die

Oliver Goldsmith 17281774


FOLKSONG

Back she came through the trembling dusk
And her mother spoke and said
What is it makes you late today
And why do you smile and sing as gay
As though you just were wed
Oh mother my hen that never had chicks
Has hatched out six

Back she came through the flaming dusk
And her mother spoke and said
What gives your eyes that dancing light
What makes your lips so strangely bright
And why are your cheeks so red
Oh mother the berries I ate in the lane
Have left a stain

Back she came through the faltering dusk
And her mother spoke and said
You are weeping your footstep is heavy with care 
What makes you totter and cling to the stair
And why do you hang your head
Oh mother  oh mother  you never can know 
I loved him so

Louis Untermeyer 1885


A VERY OLD SONG

Daughter thou art come to die
Sound be thy sleeping lass
Well without lament or cry
Mother let me pass

What things on mould were best of all
Soft be thy sleeping lass
The apples reddening till they fall
In the sun beside the convent wall
Let me pass

Whom on earth hast thou loved best
Sound be thy sleeping lass
Him that shared with me thy breast
Thee and a knight last year our guest
He hath an heron to his crest
Let me pass

What leavest thou of fame or hoard
Soft be thy sleeping lass
My farblown shame for thy reward
To my brother gold to get him a sword
Let me pass

But what wilt leave thy lover Grim
Sound be thy sleeping lass
The hair he kissed to strangle him
Mother let me pass

William Laird 1888


SHE WAS YOUNG AND BLITHE AND FAIR

She was young and blithe and fair
Firm of purpose sweet and strong
Perfect was her crown of hair
Perfect most of all her song

Yesterday beneath an oak
She was chanting in the wood
Wandering harmonies awoke
Sleeping echoes understood

Today without a song without a word
She seems to drag one piteous fallen wing
Along the ground and like a wounded bird
Move silent having lost the heart to sing

She was young and blithe and fair
Firm of purpose sweet and strong
Perfect was her crown of hair
Perfect most of all her song

Harold Monro 18791932


THE LASS THAT DIED OF LOVE

Life is not dear or gay
Till lovers kiss it
Love stole my life away
Ere I might miss it
In sober March I vowed
Id have no lover
Love laid me in my shroud
Ere June was over

I felt his body take
My body to it
And knew my heart would break
Ere I should rue it
June roses are not sad
When dewdrops steep them
My moments were so glad
I could not keep them

Proud was I love had made
Desire to fill me
I shut my eyes and prayed
That he might kill me
I saw new wonders wreathe
The stars above him
And oh I could not breathe
For kissing of him

Is love too sweet to last
Too fierce to cherish
Can kisses fall too fast
And lovers perish
Who heeds since love disarms
Death ere we near him
Within my lovers arms
I did not fear him

But since I died in sin
And all unshriven
They would not let me win
Into their heaven
They would not let my bier
Into Gods garden
But bade me tarry here
And pray for pardon

I lie and wait for grace
That shall surround me
His kisses on my face
His arms around me
And sinless maids draw near
To drop above me
A virginal sad tear
For envy of me

Richard Middleton 18821911


THE PASSIONFLOWER

My love gave me a passionflower
I nursed it well  so brief its hour
My eyelids ache my throat is dry
He told me that it would not die

My love and I are one and yet
Full oft my cheeks with tears are wet 
So sweet the night is and the bower
My love gave me a passionflower

So sweet Hold fast my hands Can God
Make all this joy revert to sod
And leave to me but this for dower 
My love gave me a passionflower

Margaret Fuller 1871


NORAH

I knew his house by the poplartrees
Green and silvery in the breeze

A heavenhigh hedge were the words he said
And hollyhocks pink and white and red   

It seemed so far from McChesneys Hall 
Where first he told me about it all

A long path runs inside from the gate 
He still can take it early or late

But where in the world is the path for me
Except the river that runs to the sea

Zoe Akins 1886


OF JOANS YOUTH

I would unto my fair restore
A simple thing
The flushing cheek she had before
Outvelveting
No more no more
On our sad shore
The carmine grape the moths auroral wing

Ah say how winds in flooding grass
Unmoor the rose
Or guileful ways the salmon pass
To sea disclose
For so alas
With Love alas
With fatal fatal Love a girlhood goes

Louise Imogen Guiney 18611920


THERES WISDOM IN WOMEN

On love is fair and love is rare my dear one she said
But love goes lightly over I bowed her foolish head
And kissed her hair and laughed at her Such a child was she
So new to love so true to love and she spoke so bitterly

But theres wisdom in women of more than they have known
And thoughts go blowing through them are wiser than their own
Or how should my dear one being ignorant and young
Have cried on love so bitterly with so true a tongue

Rupert Brooke 18871915


GOETHE AND FREDERIKA

Wander oh wander maiden sweet
In the fairy bower while yet you may
See in rapture he lies at your feet
Rest on the truth of the glorious youth
Rest  for a summer day
That great clear spirit of flickering fire
You have lulled awhile in magic sleep
But you cannot fill his wide desire
His heart is tender his eyes are deep
His words divinely flow
But his voice and his glance are not for you
He never can be to a maiden true
Soon will he wake and go
Well well twere a piteous thing
To chain forever that strong young wing
Let the butterfly break for his own sweet sake
The gossamer threads that have bound him
Let him shed in free flight his rainbow light
And gladden the world around him
Short is the struggle and slight is the strain
Such a web was made to be broken
And she that wove it may weave again
Or if no power of love to bless
Can heal the wound in her bosom true
It is but a lorn heart more or less
And hearts are many and poets few
So his pardon is lightly spoken

Henry Sidgwick 18381901


THE SONG OF THE KINGS MINSTREL

I sing no longer of the skies
And the swift clouds like driven ships
For there is earth upon my eyes
And earth between my singing lips
Because the King loved not my song
That he had found so sweet before
I lie at peace the whole night long
And sing no more
The King liked well my song that night
Upon the palace roof he lay
With his fair Queen and as I might
I sang until the mornings gray
Crept oer their faces and the King
Mocked by the breaking dawn above
Clutched at his youth and bade me sing
A song of love

Well it might be  the King was old
And though his Queen was passing fair
His dull eyes might not catch the gold
That tangled in her wayward hair
It had been much to see her smile
But with my song I made her weep
Our heavens last but a little while
So now I sleep

More than the pleasures that I had
I would have flung away to know
My song of love could make her sad
Her sweet eyes fill and tremble so
What were my paltry store of years
My bodys wretched life to stake
Against the treasure of her tears
For my loves sake

Not lightly is a King made wise
My body ached beneath his whips
And there is earth upon my eyes
And earth between my singing lips
But I sang once  and for that grace
I am content to lie and store
The vision of her dear wet face
And sing no more

Richard Middleton 18821911


ANNIE SHORE AND JOHNNIE DOON

Annie Shore twas sang last night
Down in South End saloon
A tawdry creature in the light
Painted cheeks eyes over bright
Singing a dancehall tune

Id be forgetting Annies singing 
Id not have thought again 
But for the thing that cried and fluttered
Through all the shrill refrain
Youth crying above foul words cheap music
And innocence in pain

They sentenced Johnnie Doon today
For murder stark and grim
Deaths none too dear a price they say
For suchlike men as him to pay
No need to pity him

And Johnnie Doon Id not be pitying 
I could forget him now 
But for the childish look of trouble
That fell across his brow
For the twisting hands he looked at dumbly
As if theyd sinned he knew not how

Patrick Orr 18


EMMY

Emmys exquisite youth and her virginal air
Eyes and teeth in the flash of a musical smile
Come to me out of the past and I see her there
As I saw her once for a while

Emmys laughter rings in my ears as bright
Fresh and sweet as the voice of a mountain brook
And still I hear her telling us tales that night
Out of Boccaccios book

There in the midst of the villainous dancinghall
Leaning across the table over the beer
While the music maddened the whirling skirts of the ball
As the midnight hour drew near

There with the women haggard painted and old
One fresh bud in a garland withered and stale
She with her innocent voice and her clear eyes told
Tale after shameless tale

And ever the witching smile to her face beguiled
Paused and broadened and broke in a ripple of fun
And the soul of a child looked out of the eyes of a child
Or ever the tale was done

O my child who wronged you first and began
First the dance of death that you dance so well
Soul for soul and I think the soul of a man
Shall answer for yours in hell

Arthur Symons 1865


THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN

I walked with Maisie long years back
The streets of Camden Town
I splendid in my suit of black
And she divine in brown

Hers was a proud and noble face
A secret heart and eyes
Like water in a lonely place
Beneath unclouded skies

A bed a chest a faded mat
And broken chairs a few
Were all we had to grace our flat
In Hazel Avenue

But I could walk to Hampstead Heath
And crown her head with daisies
And watch the streaming world beneath
And men with other Maisies

When I was ill and she was pale
And empty stood our store
She left the latchkey on its nail
And saw me nevermore

Perhaps she cast herself away
Lest both of us should drown
Perhaps she feared to die as they
Who die in Camden Town

What came of her The bitter nights
Destroy the rose and lily
And souls are lost among the lights
Of painted Piccadilly

What came of her The river flows
So deep and wide and stilly
And waits to catch the fallen rose
And clasp the broken lily

I dream she dwells in London still
And breathes the evening air
And often walk to Primrose Hill
And hope to meet her there

Once more together we will live
For I will find her yet
I have so little to forgive
So much I cant forget

James Elroy Flecker 18841915







LOVE AND DEATH






HELEN OF KIRCONNELL

I wish I were where Helen lies
Night and day on me she cries
O that I were where Helen lies
On fair Kirconnell lea

Cursed be the heart that thought the thought
And cursed the hand that fired the shot
When in my arms burd Helen dropped
And died to succor me

O think na ye my heart was sair
When my Love dropped and spak nae mair
There did she swoon wi meikle care
On fair Kirconnell lea

As I went down the water side
None but my foe to be my guide
None but my foe to be my guide
On fair Kirconnell lea

I lighted down my sword to draw
I hacked him in pieces sma
I hacked him in pieces sma
For her sake that died for me

O Helen fair beyond compare
Ill mak a garland o thy hair
Shall bind my heart for evermair
Until the day I dee

O that I were where Helen lies
 Night and day on me she cries
Out of my bed she bids me rise
Says Haste and come to me

O Helen fair O Helen chaste
If I were with thee Id be blest
Where thou lies low and taks thy rest
On fair Kirconnell lea

I wish my grave were growing green
A windingsheet drawn owre my een
And I in Helens arms lying
On fair Kirconnell lea

I wish I were where Helen lies
Night and day on me she cries
And I am weary of the skies
For her sake that died for me

WILLY DROWNED IN YARROW

Willys rare and Willys fair
And Willys wondrous bonny
And Willy hecht to marry me
Gin eer he married ony

Yestreen I made my bed fu braid
This night Ill make it narrow
Fpr a the livelang winter night
I lie twined of my marrow

Oh came you by yon waterside
Pud you the rose or lily
Or came you by yon meadow green
Or saw you my sweet Willy

She sought him east she sought him west
She sought him braid and narrow
Syne in the cleaving of a craig
She found him drowned in Yarrow

ANNAN WATER

Annan Waters wading deep
And my Love Annies wondrous bonny
And I am laith she should wet her feet
Because I love her best of ony

Hes loupen on his bonny gray
He rade the right gate and the ready
For all the storm he wadna stay
For seeking of his bonny lady

And he has ridden oer field and fell
Through moor and moss and many a mire
His spurs of steel were sair to bide
And from her four feet flew the fire

My bonny gray now play your part
If ye be the steed that wins my dearie
With corn and hay yell be fed for aye
And never spur shall make you wearie

The gray was a mare and a right gude mare
But when she wan the Annan Water
She could not have ridden the ford that night
Had a thousand merks been wadded at her

O boatman boatman put off your boat
Put off your boat for golden money
But for all the gold in fair Scotland
He dared not take him through to Annie

Oh I was sworn so late yestreen
Not by a single oath but mony
Ill cross the drumly stream tonight
Or never could I face my honey

The side was stey and the bottom deep
From bank to brae the water pouring
The bonny gray mare she swat for fear
For she heard the waterkelpy roaring

He spurred her forth into the flood
I wot she swam both strong and steady
But the stream was broad and her strength did fail
And he never saw his bonny lady

THE LAMENT OF THE BORDER WIDOW

My love he built me a bonnie bower
And clad it a wi lily flower
A brawer bower ye neer did see
Than my truelove he built for me

There came a man by middle day
He spied his sport and went away
And brought the king that very night
Who brake my bower and slew my knight

He slew my knight to me sae dear
He slew my knight and poind his gear
My servants all for life did flee
And left me in extremitie

I sewed his sheet making my mane
I watched the corpse mysel alane
I watched his body night and day
No living creature came that way

I took his body on my back
And whiles I gaed and whiles I sat
I digged a grave and laid him in
And happed him with the sod sae green

But think na ye my heart was sair
When I laid the moul on his yellow hair
O think na ye my heart was wae
When I turned about away to gae

Nae living man Ill love again
Since that my lovely knight is slain
Wi ae lock o his yellow hair
Ill chain my heart for evermair

Unknown


ASPATIAS SONG
From The Maids Tragedy

Lay a garland on my hearse
Of the dismal yew
Maidens willow branches bear
Say I died true

My love was false but I was firm
From my hour of birth
Upon my buried body lie
Lightly gentle earth

John Fletcher 15791625


A BALLAD
From the Whatdyecallit

Twas when the seas were roaring
With hollow blasts of wind
A damsel lay deploring
All on a rock reclined
Wide oer the foaming billows
She cast a wistful look
Her head was crowned with willows
That trembled oer the brook

Twelve months are gone and over
And nine long tedious days
Why didst thou venturous lover
Why didst thou trust the seas
Cease cease thou cruel ocean
And let my lover rest
Ah whats thy troubled motion
To that within my breast

The merchant robbed of pleasure
Sees tempests in despair
But whats the loss of treasure
To losing of my dear
Should you some coast be laid on
Where gold and diamonds grow
Youd find a richer maiden
But none that loves you so

How can they say that nature
Has nothing made in vain
Why then beneath the water
Should hideous rocks remain
No eyes the rocks discover
That lurk beneath the deep
To wreck the wandering lover
And leave the maid to weep

All melancholy lying
Thus wailed she for her dear
Repaid each blast with sighing
Each billow with a tear
When oer the white wave stooping
His floating corpse she spied
Then like a lily drooping
She bowed her head and died

John Gay 16851732


THE BRAES OF YARROW

Thy braes were bonnie Yarrow stream
When first on them I met my lover
Thy braes how dreary Yarrow stream
When now thy waves his body cover
Forever now O Yarrow stream
Thou art to me a stream of sorrow
For never on thy banks shall I
Behold my love the flower of Yarrow

He promised me a milkwhite steed
To bear me to his fathers bowers
He promised me a little page
To squire me to his fathers towers
He promised me a weddingring 
The weddingday was fixed tomorrow
Now he is wedded to his grave
Alas his watery grave in Yarrow

Sweet were his words when last we met
My passion I as freely told him
Clasped in his arms I little thought
That I should never more behold him
Scarce was he gone I saw his ghost
It vanished with a shriek of sorrow
Thrice did the waterwraith ascend
And gave a doleful groan through Yarrow

His mother from the window looked
With all the longing of a mother
His little sister weeping walked
The greenwood path to meet her brother
They sought him east they sought him west
They sought him all the forest thorough
They only saw the cloud of night
They only heard the roar of Yarrow

No longer from thy window look 
Thou hast no son thou tender mother
No longer walk thou little maid
Alas thou hast no more a brother
No longer seek him east or west
And search no more the forest thorough
For wandering in the night so dark
He fell a lifeless corse in Yarrow

The tear shall never leave my cheek
No other youth shall be my marrow
Ill seek thy body in the stream
And then with thee Ill sleep in Yarrow
The tear did never leave her cheek
No other youth became her marrow
She found his body in the stream
And now with him she sleeps in Yarrow

John Logan 17481788


THE CHURCHYARD ON THE SANDS

My love lies in the gates of foam
The last dear wreck of shore
The naked seamarsh binds her home
The sand her chamber door

The gray gull flaps the written stones
The oxbirds chase the tide
And near that narrow field of bones
Great ships at anchor ride

Black piers with crust of dripping green
One foreland like a hand
Oer intervals of grass between
Dim lonely dunes of sand

A church of silent weathered looks
A breezy reddish tower
A yard whose mounded restingnooks
Are tinged with sorrel flower

In peace the swallows eggs are laid
Along the belfry walls
The tempest does not reach her shade
The rain her silent halls

But sails are sweet in summer sky
The lark throws down a lay
The long salt levels steam and dry
The cloudheart melts away

But patches of the seapink shine
The pied crows poise and come
The mallow hangs the bindweeds twine
Where her sweet lips are dumb

The passion of the wave is mute
No sound or ocean shock
No music save the trilling flute
That marks the curlew flock

But yonder when the wind is keen
And rainy air is clear
The merchant citys spires are seen
The toil of men grows near

Along the coastway grind the wheels
Of endless carts of coal
And on the sides of giant keels
The shipyard hammers roll

The world creeps here upon the shout
And stirs my heart to pain
The mist descends and blots it out
And I am strong again

Strong and alone my dove with thee
And though mine eyes be wet
Theres nothing in the world to me
So dear as my regret

I would not change my sorrow sweet
For others nuptial hours
I love the daisies at thy feet
More than their orange flowers

My hand alone shall tend thy tomb
From leafbud to leaffall
And wreathe around each seasons bloom
Till autumn ruins all

Let snowdrops early in the year
Droop oer her silent breast
And bid the later cowslip rear
The amber of its crest

Come hither linnets tuftedred
Drift by O wailing tern
Set pure vale lilies at her head
At her feet ladyfern

Grow samphire at the tidal brink
Wave pansies of the shore
To whisper how alone I think
Of her for evermore

Bring blue seahollies thorny keen
Long lavender in flower
Gray wormwood like a hoary queen
Stanch mullein like a tower

O seawall mounded long and low
Let iron bounds be thine
Nor let the salt wave overflow
That breast I held divine

Nor float its seaweed to her hair
Nor dim her eyes with sands
No fluted cockle burrow where
Sleep folds her patient hands

Though thy crest feel the wild seas breath
Though tideweight tear thy root
Oh guard the treasurehouse where death
Has bound my Darling mute

Though cold her pale lips to reward
With loves own mysteries
Ah rob no daisy from her swand
Rough gale of eastern seas

Ah render sere no silken bent
That by her headstone waves
Let noon and golden summer blent
Pervade these ocean graves

And ah dear heart in thy still nest
Resign this earth of woes
Forget the ardors of the west
Neglect the morning glows

Sleep and forget all things but one
Heard in each wave of sea 
How lonely all the years will run
Until I rest by thee

John Byrne Leicester Warren 18351895


THE MINSTRELS SONG
From Aella

Oh sing unto my roundelay
Oh drop the briny tear with me
Dance no more at holiday
Like a running river be
My love is dead
Gone to his deathbed
All under the willow tree

Black his hair as the winter night
White his throat as the summer snow
Red his cheek as the morning light
Cold he lies in the grave below

Sweet his tongue as the throstles note
Quick in dance as thought can be
Deft his tabor cudgel stout
Oh he lies by the willow tree

Hark the raven flaps his wing
In the briery dell below
Hark the deathowl loud doth sing
To the nightmares as they go

See the white moon shines on high
Whiter is my true loves shroud
Whiter than the morning sky
Whiter than the evening cloud

Here upon my true loves grave
Shall the barren flowers be laid
Not one holy saint to save
All the coldness of a maid

With my hands Ill twist the briers
Round his holy corpse to gre
Elfin fairy light your fires
Here my body still shall be

Come with acorncup and thorn
Drain my heartes blood away
Life and all its good I scorn
Dance by night or feast by day

Waterwitches crowned with reeds
Bear me to your deadly tide
I die I come my true love waits
Thus the damsel spake and died

Thomas Chatterton 17521770


HIGHLAND MARY

Ye banks and braes and streams around
The castle o Montgomery
Green be your woods and fair your flowers
Your waters never drumlie
There simmer first unfauld her robes
And there the langest tarry
For there I took the last fareweel
O my sweet Highland Mary

How sweetly bloomed the gay green birk
How rich the hawthorns blossom
As underneath their fragrant shade
I clasped her to my bosom
The golden hours on angels wings
Flew oer me and my dearie
For dear to me as light and life
Was my sweet Highland Mary

Wi mony a vow and locked embrace
Our parting was fu tender
And pledging aft to meet again
We tore oursels asunder
But O fell Deaths untimely frost
That nipped my flower sae early
Now greens the sod and caulds the clay
That wraps my Highland Mary

O pale pale now those rosy lips
I aft hae kissed sae fondly
And closed for aye the sparkling glance
That dwelt on me sae kindly
And moldering now in silent dust
That heart that loed me dearly
But still within my bosoms core
Shall live my Highland Mary

Robert Burns 17591796


TO MARY IN HEAVEN

Thou lingering star with lessening ray
That lovst to greet the early morn
Again thou usherst in the day
My Mary from my soul was torn
O Mary dear departed shade
Where is thy place of blissful rest
Seest thou thy lover lowly laid
Hearst thou the groans that rend his breast

That sacred hour can I forget
Can I forget the hallowed grove
Where by the winding Ayr we met
To live one day of parting love
Eternity will not efface
Those records dear of transports past
Thy image at our last embrace 
Ah little thought we twas our last

Ayr gurgling kissed his pebbled shore
Oerhung with wild woods thickening green
The fragrant birch and hawthorn hoar
Twined amorous round the raptured scene
The flowers sprang wanton to be pressed
The birds sang love on every spray 
Till soon too soon the glowing west
Proclaimed the speed of winged day

Still oer these scenes my memory wakes
And fondly broods with miser care
Time but the impression stronger makes
As streams their channels deeper wear
My Mary dear departed shade
Where is thy place of blissful rest
Seest thou thy lover lowly laid
Hearst thou the groans that rend his breast

Robert Burns 17591796


LUCY

I
Strange fits of passion have I known
And I will dare to tell
But in the lovers ear alone
What once to me befell

When she I loved looked every day
Fresh as a rose in June
I to her cottage bent my way
Beneath an evening moon

Upon the moon I fixed my eye
All over the wide lea
With quickening pace my horse drew nigh
Those paths so dear to me

And now we reached the orchardplot
And as we climbed the hill
The sinking moon to Lucys cot
Came near and nearer still

In one of those sweet dreams I slept
Kind Natures gentlest boon
And all the while my eyes I kept
On the descending moon

My horse moved on hoof after hoof
He raised and never stopped
When down behind the cottage roof
At once the bright moon dropped

What fond and wayward thoughts will slide
Into a lovers head
O mercy to myself I cried
If Lucy should be dead

II
She dwelt among the untrodden ways
Beside the springs of Dove
A Maid whom there were none to praise
And very few to love

A violet by a mossy stone
Half hidden from the eye
Fair as a star when only one
Is shining in the sky

She lived unknown and few could know
When Lucy ceased to be
But she is in her grave and oh
The difference to me

III
I traveled among unknown men
In lands beyond the sea
Nor England did I know till then
What love I bore to thee

Tis past that melancholy dream
Nor will I quit thy shore
A second time for still I seem
To love thee more and more

Among thy mountains did I feel
The joy of my desire
And she I cherished turned her wheel
Beside an English fire

Thy mornings showed thy nights concealed
The bowers where Lucy played
And thine too is the last green field
That Lucys eyes surveyed

IV
Three years she grew in sun and shower
Then Nature said A lovelier flower
On earth was never sown
This child I to myself will take
She shall be mine and I will make
A lady of my own

Myself will to my darling be
Both law and impulse and with me
The girl in rock and plain
In earth and heaven in glade and bower
Shall feel an overseeing power
To kindle or restrain

She shall be sportive as the fawn
That wild with glee across the lawn
Or up the mountain springs
And hers shall be the breathing balm
And hers the silence and the calm
Of mute insensate things

The floating clouds their state shall lend
To her for her the willow bend
Nor shall she fail to see
Even in the motions of the storm
Grace that shall mold the maidens form
By silent sympathy

The stars of midnight shall be dear
To her and she shall lean her ear
In many a secret place
Where rivulets dance their wayward round
And beauty born of murmuring sound
Shall pass into her face

And vital feelings of delight
Shall rear her form to stately height
Her virgin bosom swell
Such thoughts to Lucy I will give
While she and I together live
Here in this happy dell

Thus Nature spake  The work was done 
How soon my Lucys race was run
She died and left to me
This heath this calm and quiet scene
The memory of what has been
And never more will be

V
A slumber did my spirit seal
I had no human fears
She seemed a thing that could not feel
The touch of earthly years

No motion has she now or force
She neither hears nor sees
Rolled round in earths diurnal course
With rocks and stones and trees

William Wordsworth 17701850


PROUD MAISIE
From The Heart of Midlothian

Proud Maisie is in the wood
Walking so early
Sweet Robin sits on the bush
Singing so rarely

Tell me thou bonny bird
When shall I marry me
 When six braw gentlemen
Kirkward shall carry ye

Who makes the bridal bed
Birdie say truly
 The grayheaded sexton
That delves the grave duly

The glowworm oer grave and stone
Shall light thee steady
The owl from the steeple sing
Welcome proud lady

Walter Scott 17711832


SONG

Earl March looked on his dying child
And smit with grief to view her 
The youth he cried whom I exiled
Shall be restored to woo her

Shes at the window many an hour
His coming to discover
And he looked up to Ellens bower
And she looked on her lover 

But ah so pale he knew her not
Though her smile on him was dwelling
And I am then forgot  forgot
It broke the heart of Ellen

In vain he weeps in vain he sighs
Her cheek is cold as ashes
Nor loves own kiss shall wake those eyes
To lift their silken lashes

Thomas Campbell 17771844


THE MAIDS LAMENT
From The Examination of Shakespeare

I loved him not and yet now he is gone
I feel I am alone
I checked him while he spoke yet could he speak
Alas I would not check
For reasons not to love him once I sought
And wearied all my thought
To vex myself and him I now would give
My love could he but live
Who lately lived for me and when he found
Twas vain in holy ground
He hid his face amid the shades of death
I waste for him my breath
Who wasted his for me but mine returns
And this lorn bosom burns
With stifling heat heaving it up in sleep
And waking me to weep
Tears that had melted his soft heart for years
Wept he as bitter tears
Merciful God Such was his latest prayer
These may she never share
Quieter is his breath his breast more cold
Than daisies in the mold
Where children spell athwart the churchyard gate
His name and lifes brief date
Pray for him gentle souls whoeer you be
And oh pray too for me

Walter Savage Landor 17751864


SHE IS FAR FROM THE LAND

She is far from the land where her young hero sleeps
And lovers are round her sighing
But coldly she turns from their gaze and weeps
For her heart in his grave is lying

She sings the wild songs of her dear native plains
Every note which he loved awaking 
Ah little they think who delight in her strains
How the heart of the minstrel is breaking

He had lived for his love for his country he died
They were all that to life had entwined him
Nor soon shall the tears of his country be dried
Nor long will his love stay behind him

Oh make her a grave where the sunbeams rest
When they promise a glorious morrow
Theyll shine oer her sleep like a smile from the West
From her own loved island of sorrow

Thomas Moore 17791852


AT THE MID HOUR OF NIGHT

At the mid hour of night when stars are weeping I fly
To the lone vale we loved when life shone warm in thine eye
And I think oft if spirits can steal from the regions of air
To revisit past scenes of delight thou wilt come to me there
And tell me our love is remembered even in the sky

Then I sing the wild song twas once such rapture to hear
When our voices commingling breathed like one on the ear
And as Echo far off through the vale my sad orison rolls
I think O my love tis thy voice from the Kingdom of Souls
Faintly answering still the notes that once were so dear

Thomas Moore 17791852


ON A PICTURE BY POUSSIN REPRESENTING
SHEPHERDS IN ARCADIA

Ah happy youths ah happy maid
Snatch present pleasure while ye may
Laugh dance and sing in sunny glade
Your limbs are light your hearts are gay
Ye little think there comes a day
Twill come to you it came to me
When love and life shall pass away
I too once dwelt in Arcady

Or listless lie by yonder stream
And muse and watch the ripples play
Or note their noiseless flow and deem
That life thus gently glides away 
That love is but a sunny ray
To make our years go smiling by
I knew that stream I too could dream
I too once dwelt in Arcady

Sing shepherds sing sweet lady listen
Sing to the music of the rill
With happy tears her bright eyes glisten
For as each pause the echoes fill
They waft her name from hill to hill 
So listened my lost love to me
The voice she loved has long been still
I too once dwelt in Arcady

John Addington Symonds 18401893


THRENODY

Theres a grassgrown road from the valley 
A winding road and steep 
That leads to the quiet hilltop
Where lies your love asleep   
While mine is lying God knows where
A hundred fathoms deep

I saw you kneel at a graveside 
How still a grave can be
Wrapped in the tender starlight
Far from the moaning sea
But through all dreams and starlight
The breakers call to me

Oh steep is your way to Silence 
But steeper the ways I roam
For never a road can take me
Beyond the wind and foam
And never a road can reach him
Who lies so far from home

Ruth Guthrie Harding 1882


STRONG AS DEATH

O death when thou shalt come to me
From out thy dark where she is now
Come not with graveyard smell on thee
Or withered roses on thy brow

Come not O Death with hollow tone
And soundless step and clammy hand 
Lo I am now no less alone
Than in thy desolate doubtful land

But with that sweet arid subtle scent
That ever clung about her such
As with all things she brushed was blent
And with her quick and tender touch

With the dim gold that lit her hair
Crown thyself Death let fall thy tread
So light that I may dream her there
And turn upon my dying bed

And through my chilling veins shall flame
My love as though beneath her breath
And in her voice but call my name
And I will follow thee O Death

Henry Cuyler Bunner 18551896


I SHALL NOT CRY RETURN

I shall not cry Return Return
Nor weep my years away
But just as long as sunsets burn
And dawns make no delay
I shall be lonesome  I shall miss
Your hand your voice your smile your kiss

Not often shall I speak your name
For what would strangers care
That once a sudden tempest came
And swept my gardens bare
And then you passed and in your place
Stood Silence with her lifted face

Not always shall this parting be
For though I travel slow
I too may claim eternity
And find the way you go
And so I do my task and wait
The opening of the outer gate

Ellen M H Gates 18351920


OH SNATCHED AWAY IN BEAUTYS BLOOM

Oh snatched away in beautys bloom
On thee shall press no ponderous tomb
But on thy turf shall roses rear
Their leaves the earliest of the year
And the wild cypress wave in tender gloom

And oft by yon blue gushing stream
Shall Sorrow lean her drooping head
And feed deep thought with many a dream
And lingering pause and lightly tread
Fond wretch as if her step disturbed the dead

Away we know that tears are vain
That Death nor heeds nor hears distress
Will this unteach us to complain
Or make one mourner weep the less
And thou  who tellst me to forget
Thy looks are wan thine eyes are wet

George Gordon Byron 17881824


TO MARY

If I had thought thou couldst have died
I might not weep for thee
But I forgot when by thy side
That thou couldst mortal be
It never through my mind had passed
The time would eer be oer
And I on thee should look my last
And thou shouldst smile no more

And still upon that face I look
And think twill smile again
And still the thought I will not brook
That I must look in vain
But when I speak  thou dost not say
What thou neer leftst unsaid
And now I feel as well I may
Sweet Mary thou art dead

If thou wouldst stay een as thou art
All cold and all serene
I still might press thy silent heart
And where thy smiles have been
While een thy chill bleak corse I have
Thou seemest still mine own
But there I lay thee in thy grave 
And I am now alone

I do not think whereer thou art
Thou hast forgotten me
And I perhaps may soothe this heart
In thinking too of thee
Yet there was round thee such a dawn
Of light neer seen before
As fancy never could have drawn
And never can restore

Charles Wolfe 17911823


MY HEART AND I

Enough were tired my heart and I
We sit beside the headstone thus
And wish that name were carved for us
The moss reprints more tenderly
The hard types of the masons knife
As Heavens sweet life renews earths life
With which were tired my heart and I

You see were tired my heart and I
We dealt with books we trusted men
And in our own blood drenched the pen
As if such colors could not fly
We walked too straight for fortunes end
We loved too true to keep a friend
At last were tired my heart and I

How tired we feel my heart and I
We seem of no use in the world
Our fancies hang gray and uncurled
About mens eyes indifferently
Our voice which thrilled you so will let
You sleep our tears are only wet
What do we here my heart and I

So tired so tired my heart and I
It was not thus in that old time
When Ralph sat with me neath the lime
To watch the sunset from the sky
Dear love youre looking tired he said
I smiling at him shook my head
Tis now were tired my heart and I

So tired so tired my heart and I
Though now none takes me on his arm
To fold me close and kiss me warm
Till each quick breath end in a sigh
Of happy languor Now alone
We lean upon this graveyard stone
Uncheered unkissed my heart and I

Tired out we are my heart and I
Suppose the world brought diadems
To tempt us crusted with loose gems
Of powers and pleasures Let it try
We scarcely care to look at even
A pretty child or Gods blue heaven
We feel so tired my heart and I

Yet who complains My heart and I
In this abundant earth no doubt
Is little room for things worn out
Disdain them break them throw them by
And if before the days grew rough
We once were loved used  well enough
I think weve fared my heart and I

Elizabeth Barrett Browning 18061861


ROSALINDS SCROLL
From The Poets Vow

I left thee last a child at heart
A woman scarce in years
I come to thee a solemn corpse
Which neither feels nor fears
I have no breath to use in sighs
They laid the deadweights on mine eyes
To seal them safe from tears

Look on me with thine own calm look
I meet it calm as thou
No look of thine can change this smile
Or break thy sinful vow
I tell thee that my poor scorned heart
Is of thine earth  thine earth a part
It cannot vex thee now

But out alas these words are writ
By a living loving one
Adown whose cheeks the proofs of life
The warm quick tears do run
Ah let the unloving corpse control
Thy scorn back from the loving soul
Whose place of rest is won

I have prayed for thee with bursting sob
When passions course was free
I have prayed for thee with silent lips
In the anguish none could see
They whispered oft She sleepeth soft 
But I only prayed for thee

Go to I pray for thee no more
The corpses tongue is still
Its folded fingers point to heaven
But point there stiff and chill
No farther wrong no farther woe
Hath license from the sin below
Its tranquil heart to thrill

I charge thee by the livings prayer
And the deads silentness
To wring from out thy soul a cry
Which God shall hear and bless
Lest Heavens own palm droop in my hand
And pale among the saints I stand
A saint companionless

Elizabeth Barrett Browning 18061861


LAMENT OF THE IRISH EMIGRANT

Im sittin on the stile Mary
Where we sat side by side
On a bright May mornin long ago
When first you were my bride
The corn was springin fresh and green
And the lark sang loud and high
And the red was on your lip Mary
And the lovelight in your eye

The place is little changed Mary
The day is bright as then
The larks loud song is in my ear
And the corn is green again
But I miss the soft clasp of your hand
And your breath warm on my cheek
And I still keep listnin for the words
You never more will speak

Tis but a step down yonder lane
And the little church stands near 
The church where we were wed Mary
I see the spire from here
But the graveyard lies between Mary
And my step might break your rest 
For Ive laid you darling down to sleep
With your baby on your breast

Im very lonely now Mary
For the poor make no new friends
But oh they love the better still
The few our Father sends
And you were all I had Mary
My blessin and my pride
Theres nothin left to care for now
Since my poor Mary died

Yours was the good brave heart Mary
That still kept hoping on
When the trust in God had left my soul
And my arms young strength was gone
There was comfort ever on your lip
And the kind look on your brow 
I bless you Mary for that same
Though you cannot hear me now

I thank you for the patient smile
When your heart was fit to break
When the hunger pain was gnawin there
And you hid it for my sake
I bless you for the pleasant word
When your heart was sad and sore 
Oh Im thankful you are gone Mary
Where grief cant reach you more

Im biddin you a long farewell
My Mary  kind and true
But Ill not forget you darling
In the land Im goin to
They say theres bread and work for all
And the sun shines always there
But Ill not forget old Ireland
Were it fifty times as fair

And often in those grand old woods
Ill sit and shut my eyes
And my heart will travel back again
To the place where Mary lies
And Ill think I see the little stile
Where we sat side by side
And the springin corn and the bright May morn
When first you were my bride

Helen Selina Sheridan 18071867


THE KING OF DENMARKS RIDE

Word was brought to the Danish king
Hurry
That the love of his heart lay suffering
And pined for the comfort his voice would bring
O ride as though you were flying
Better he loves each golden curl
On the brow of that Scandinavian girl
Than his rich crown jewels of ruby and pearl
And his rose of the isles is dying

Thirty nobles saddled with speed
Hurry
Each one mounting a gallant steed
Which he kept for battle and days of need
O ride as though you were flying
Spurs were struck in the foaming flank
Wornout chargers staggered and sank
Bridles were slackened and girths were burst
But ride as they would the king rode first
For his rose of the isles lay dying

His nobles are beaten one by one
Hurry
They have fainted and faltered and homeward gone
His little fair page now follows alone
For strength and for courage trying
The king looked back at that faithful child
Wan was the face that answering smiled
They passed the drawbridge with clattering din
Then he dropped and only the king rode in
Where his rose of the isles lay dying

The king blew a blast on his bugle horn
Silence
No answer came but faint and forlorn
An echo returned on the cold gray morn
Like the breath of a spirit sighing
The castle portal stood grimly wide
None welcomed the king from that weary ride
For dead in the light of the dawning day
The pale sweet form of the welcomer lay
Who had yearned for his voice while dying

The panting steed with a drooping crest
Stood weary
The king returned from her chamber of rest
The thick sobs choking in his breast
And that dumb companion eyeing
The tears gushed forth which he strove to check
He bowed his head on his chargers neck
O steed that every nerve didst strain
Dear steed our ride hath been in vain
To the halls where my love lay dying

Caroline Elizabeth Sarah Norton 18081870


THE WATCHER

A rose for a young head
A ring for a bride
Joy for the homestead
Clean and wide 
Whos that waiting
In the rain outside

A heart for an old friend
A hand for the new
Love can to earth lend
Heavens hue 
Whos that standing
In the silver dew

A smile for the parting
A tear as they go
Gods sweethearting
Ends just so 
Whos that watching
Where the black winds blow

He who is waiting
In the rain outside
He who is standing
Where the dew drops wide
He who is watching
In the wind must ride
Though the pale hands cling
With the rose
And the ring
And the bride
Must ride
With the red of the rose
And the gold of the ring
And the lips and the hair of the bride

James Stephens 1882


THE THREE SISTERS

Gone are those three those sisters rare
With wonderlips and eyes ashine
One was wise and one was fair
And one was mine

Ye mourners weave for the sleeping hair
Of only two your ivy vine
For one was wise and one was fair
But one was mine

Arthur Davison Ficke 1883


BALLAD

He said The shadows darken down
The night is near at hand
Now whos the friend will follow me
Into the sunless land

For I have vassals leal and true
And I have comrades kind
And wheresoeer my soul shall speed
They will not stay behind

He sought the brother young and blithe
Who bore his spear and shield
In the long chase youve followed me
And in the battlefield

Few vows you make but trues your heart
And you with me will win
He said God speed you brother mine
But I am next of kin

He sought the friar the gray old priest
Who loved his fathers board
The friar he turned him to the east
And reverently adored

He said A godless name you bear
A godless life youve led
And whoso wins along with you
His spirit shall have dread

Oh hasten get your guilty soul
From every burden shriven
Yet you are bound for flame and dole
But I am bound for heaven

He sought the lady bright and proud
Who sate at his right hand
Make haste O Love to follow me
Into the sunless land

She said And pass you in your prime
Heaven give me days of cheer
And keep me from the sunless clime
Many and many a year

All heavily the sun sank down
Among black clouds of fate
There came a woman fair and wan
Unto the castle gate

Through gazing vassals idle serfs
So silently she sped
The winding staircase echoed not
Unto her light light tread

His lady eyed her scornfully
She stood at his right hand
She said And I will follow you
Into the sunless land

There is no expiation none
A bitter load I bore
Now I shall love you nevermore
Never and nevermore

There is no touch or tone of yours
Can make the old love wake
She said But I will follow you
Even for the old loves sake

Oh he has kissed her on the brow
He took her by the hand
Into the sunless land they went
Into the starless land

May Kendall 1861


O THAT TWERE POSSIBLE
From Maud

O that twere possible
After long grief and pain
To find the arms of my true love
Round me once again

When I was wont to meet her
In the silent moody places
Of the land that gave me birth
We stood tranced in long embraces
Mixed with kisses sweeter sweeter
Than anything on earth

A shadow flits before me
Not thou but like to thee
Ah Christ that it were possible
For one short hour to see
The souls we loved that they might tell us
What and where they be

Alfred Tennyson 18091892


HOME THEY BROUGHT HER WARRIOR DEAD
From The Princess

Home they brought her warrior dead
She nor swooned nor uttered cry
All her maidens watching said
She must weep or she will die

Then they praised him soft and low
Called him worthy to be loved
Truest friend and noblest foe
Yet she neither spoke nor moved

Stole a maiden from her place
Lightly to the warrior stepped
Took the facecloth from the face
Yet she neither moved nor wept

Rose a nurse of ninety years
Set his child upon her knee 
Like summer tempest came her tears
Sweet my child I live for thee

Alfred Tennyson 18091892


EVELYN HOPE

Beautiful Evelyn Hope is dead
Sit and watch by her side an hour
That is her bookshelf this her bed
She plucked that piece of geraniumflower
Beginning to die too in the glass
Little has yet been changed I think
The shutters are shut no light may pass
Save two long rays through the hinges chink

Sixteen years old when she died
Perhaps she had scarcely heard my name
It was not her time to love beside
Her life had many a hope and aim
Duties enough and little cares
And now was quiet now astir
Till Gods hand beckoned unawares 
And the sweet white brow is all of her

Is it too late then Evelyn Hope
What your soul was pure and true
The good stars met in your horoscope
Made you of spirit fire and dew 
And just because I was thrice as old
And our paths in the world diverged so wide
Each was naught to each must I be told
We were fellow mortals naught beside

No indeed for God above
Is great to grant as mighty to make
And creates the love to reward the love
I claim you still for my own loves sake
Delayed it may be for more lives yet
Through worlds I shall traverse not a few
Much is to learn much to forget
Ere the time be come for taking you

But the time will come  at last it will
When Evelyn Hope what meant I shall say
In the lower earth in the years long still
That body and soul so pure and gay
Why your hair was amber I shall divine
And your mouth of your own geraniums red 
And what you would do with me in fine
In the new life come in the old ones stead

I have lived I shall say so much since then
Given up myself so many times
Gained me the gains of various men
Ransacked the ages spoiled the climes
Yet one thing one in my souls full scope
Either I missed or itself missed me
And I want and find you Evelyn Hope
What is the issue let us see

I loved you Evelyn all the while
My heart seemed full as it could hold
There was place and to spare for the frank young smile
And the red young mouth and the hairs young gold
So hush  I will give you this leaf to keep
See I shut it inside the sweet cold hand
There that is our secret go to sleep
You will wake and remember and understand

Robert Browning 18121889


REMEMBRANCE

Cold in the earth  and the deep snow piled above thee
Far far removed cold in the dreary grave
Have I forgot my only Love to love thee
Severed at last by Times allsevering wave

Now when alone do my thoughts no longer hover
Over the mountains on that northern shore
Resting their wings where heath and fernleaves cover
Thy noble heart for ever ever more

Cold in the earth  and fifteen wild Decembers
From those brown hills have melted into spring
Faithful indeed is the spirit that remembers
After such years of change and suffering

Sweet Love of youth forgive if I forget thee
While the worlds tide is bearing me along
Other desires and other hopes beset me
Hopes which obscure but cannot do thee wrong

No later light has lightened up my heaven
No second morn has ever shone for me
All my lifes bliss from thy dear life was given
All my lifes bliss is in the grave with thee

But when the days of golden dreams had perished
And even Despair was powerless to destroy
Then did I learn how existence could be cherished
Strengthened and fed without the aid of joy

Then did I check the tears of useless passion 
Weaned my young soul from yearning after thine
Sternly denied its burning wish to hasten
Down to that tomb already more than mine

And even yet I dare not let it languish
Dare not indulge in memorys rapturous pain
Once drinking deep of that divinest anguish
How could I seek the empty world again

Emily Bronte 18181848


SONG

The linnet in the rocky dells
The moorlark in the air
The bee among the heather bells
That hide my lady fair

The wild deer browse above her breast
The wild birds raise their brood
And they her smiles of love caressed
Have left her solitude

I ween that when the graves dark wall
Did first her form retain
They thought their hearts could neer recall
The light of joy again

They thought the tide of grief would flow
Unchecked through future years
But where is all their anguish now
And where are all their tears

Well let them fight for honors breath
Or pleasures shade pursue
The dweller in the land of death
Is changed and careless too

And if their eyes should watch and weep
Till sorrows source were dry
She would not in her tranquil sleep
Return a single sigh

Blow westwind by the lonely mound
And murmur summer streams
There is no need of other sound
To soothe my ladys dreams

Emily Bronte 18181848


SONG OF THE OLD LOVE
From Supper at the Mill

When sparrows build and the leaves break forth
My old sorrow wakes and cries
For I know there is dawn in the far far north
And a scarlet sun doth rise
Like a scarlet fleece the snowfield spreads
And the icy founts run free
And the bergs begin to bow their heads
And plunge and sail in the sea

O my lost love and my own own love
And my love that loved me so
Is there never a chink in the world above
Where they listen for words from below
Nay I spoke once and I grieved thee sore
I remember all that I said
And now thou wilt hear me no more  no more
Till the sea gives up her dead

Thou didst set thy foot on the ship and sail
To the icefields and the snow
Thou wert sad for thy love did naught avail
And the end I could not know
How could I tell I should love thee today
Whom that day I held not dear
How could I know I should love thee away
When I did not love thee anear

We shall walk no more through the sodden plain
With the faded bents oerspread
We shall stand no more by the seething main
While the dark wrack drives oerhead
We shall part no more in the wind and the rain
Where thy last farewell was said
But perhaps I shall meet thee and know thee again
When the sea gives up her dead

Jean Ingelow 18201897


REQUIESCAT

Strew on her roses roses
And never a spray of yew
In quiet she reposes
Ah would that I did too

Her mirth the world required
She bathed it in smiles of glee
But her heart was tired tired
And now they let her be

Her life was turning turning
In mazes of heat and sound
But for peace her soul was yearning
And now peace laps her round

Her cabined ample Spirit
It fluttered and failed for breath
Tonight it doth inherit
The vasty hall of Death

Matthew Arnold 18221888


TOO LATE
DOWGLAS DOWGLAS TENDIR AND TREU

Could ye come back to me Douglas Douglas
In the old likeness that I knew
I would be so faithful so loving Douglas
Douglas Douglas tender and true

Never a scornful word should grieve ye
Id smile on ye sweet as the angels do
Sweet as your smile on me shone ever
Douglas Douglas tender and true

Oh to call back the days that are not
My eyes were blinded your words were few
Do you know the truth now up in heaven
Douglas Douglas tender and true

I never was worthy of you Douglas
Not half worthy the like of you
Now all men beside seem to me like shadows 
I love you Douglas tender and true

Stretch out your hand to me Douglas Douglas
Drop forgiveness from heaven like dew
As I lay my heart on your dead heart Douglas
Douglas Douglas tender and true

Dinah Maria Mulock Craik 18261887


FOUR YEARS

At the Midsummer when the hay was down
Said I mournful  Though my life be in its prime
Bare lie my meadows all shorn before their time
Oer my sere woodlands the leaves are turning brown
It is the hot Midsummer when the hay is down

At the Midsummer when the hay was down
Stood she by the brooklet young and very fair
With the first white bindweed twisted in her hair 
Hair that drooped like birchboughs all in her simple gown 
That eve in high Midsummer when the hay was down

At the Midsummer when the hay was down
Crept she a willing bride close into my breast
Lowpiled the thunderclouds had sunk into the west
Redeyed the sun outglared like knight from leaguered town
It was the high Midsummer and the sun was down

It is Midsummer  all the hay is down
Close to her forehead press I dying eyes
Praying God shield her till we meet in Paradise
Bless her in loves name who was my joy and crown
And I go at Midsummer when the hay is down

Dinah Maria Mulock Craik 18261887


BARBARA

On the Sabbathday
Through the churchyard old and gray
Over the crisp and yellow leaves I held my rustling way
And amid the words of mercy falling on my soul like balms
Mid the gorgeous storms of music  in the mellow organ calms
Mid the upward streaming prayers and the rich and solemn psalms
I stood careless Barbara

My heart was otherwhere
While the organ shook the air
And the priest with outspread hands blessed the people with a prayer
But when rising to go homeward with a mild and saintlike shine
Gleamed a face of airy beauty with its heavenly eyes on mine 
Gleamed and vanished in a moment  O that face was surely thine
Out of heaven Barbara

O pallid pallid face
O earnest eyes of grace
When last I saw thee dearest it was in another place
You came running forth to meet me with my lovegift on your wrist
The flutter of a long white dress then all was lost in mist 
A purple stain of agony was on the mouth I kissed
That wild morning Barbara

I searched in my despair
Sunny noon and midnight air
I could not drive away the thought that you were lingering there
O many and many a winter night I sat when you were gone
My worn face buried in my hands beside the fire alone
Within the dripping churchyard the rain plashing on your stone
You were sleeping Barbara

Mong angels do you think
Of the precious golden link
I clasped around your happy arm while sitting by yon brink
Or when that night of gliding dance of laughter and guitars
Was emptied of its music and we watched through latticebars
The silent midnight heaven creeping oer us with its stars
Till the day broke Barbara

In the years Ive changed
Wild and far my heart has ranged
And many sins and errors now have been on me avenged
But to you I have been faithful whatsoever good I lacked
I loved you and above my life still hangs that love intact 
Your love the trembling rainbow I the reckless cataract
Still I love you Barbara

Yet love I am unblest
With many doubts oppressed
I wander like a desert wind without a place of rest
Could I but win you for an hour from off that starry shore
The hunger of my soul were stilled for Death hath told you more
Than the melancholy world doth know things deeper than all lore
Will you teach me Barbara

In vain in vain in vain
You will never come again
There droops upon the dreary hills a mournful fringe of rain
The gloaming closes slowly round loud winds are in the tree
Round selfish shores for ever moans the hurt and wounded sea
There is no rest upon the earth peace is with Death and thee
Barbara

Alexander Smith 18301867


SONG

When I am dead my dearest
Sing no sad songs for me
Plant thou no roses at my head
Nor shady cypresstree
Be the green grass above me
With showers and dewdrops wet
And if thou wilt remember
And if thou wilt forget

I shall not see the shadows
I shall not feel the rain
I shall not hear the nightingale
Sing on as if in pain
And dreaming through the twilight
That doth not rise nor set
Haply I may remember
And haply may forget

Christina Georgina Rossetti 18301894


SARRAZINES SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER
From Chaitivel

Hath any loved you well down there
Summer or winter through
Down there have you found any fair
Laid in the grave with you
Is deaths long kiss a richer kiss
Than mine was wont to be 
Or have you gone to some far bliss
And quite forgotten me

What soft enamoring of sleep
Hath you in some soft way
What charmed death holdeth you with deep
Strange lure by night and day
 A little space below the grass
Out of the sun and shade
But worlds away from me alas
Down there where you are laid

My bright hairs waved and wasted gold
What is it now to thee 
Whether the rosered life I hold
Or white death holdeth me
Down there you love the graves own green
And evermore you rave
Of some sweet seraph you have seen
Or dreamt of in the grave

There you shall lie as you have lain
Though in the world above
Another life you live again
Loving again your love
Is it not sweet beneath the palm
Is not the warm day rife
With some long mystic golden calm
Better than love and life

The broad quaint odorous leaves like hands
Weaving the fair day through
Weave sleep no burnished bird withstands
While death weaves sleep for you
And many a strange rich breathing sound
Ravishes morn and noon
And in that place you must have found
Death a delicious swoon

Hold me no longer for a word
I used to say or sing
Ah long ago you must have heard
So many a sweeter thing
For rich earth must have reached your heart
And turned the faith to flowers
And warm wind stolen part by part
Your soul through faithless hours

And many a soft seed must have won
Soil of some yielding thought
To bring a bloom up to the sun
That else had neer been brought
And doubtless many a passionate hue
Hath made that place more fair
Making some passionate part of you
Faithless to me down there

Arthur OShaughnessy 18441884


LOVE AND DEATH

In the wild autumn weather when the rain was on the sea
And the boughs sobbed together Death came and spake to me
Those red drops of thy heart I have come to take from thee
As the storm sheds the rose so thy love shall broken be
Said Death to me

Then I stood straight and fearless while the rain was in the wave
And I spake low and tearless When thou hast made my grave
Those red drops from my heart then thou shalt surely have
But the rose keeps its bloom as I my love will save
All for my grave

In the wild autumn weather a dread sword slipped from its sheath
While the boughs sobbed together I fought a fight with Death
And I vanquished him with prayer and I vanquished him by faith
Now the summer air is sweet with the roses fragrant breath
That conquered Death

Rosa Mulholland 18 1921


TO ONE IN PARADISE

Thou wast all that to me love
For which my soul did pine
A green isle in the sea love
A fountain and a shrine
All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers
And all the flowers were mine

Ah dream too bright to last
Ah starry Hope that didst arise
But to be overcast
A voice from out of the Future cries
On on  but oer the Past
Dim gulf my spirit hovering lies
Mute motionless aghast

For alas alas with me
The light of Life is oer
No more  no more  no more 
Such language holds the solemn sea
To the sands upon the shore
Shall bloom the thunderblasted tree
Or the stricken eagle soar

And all my days are trances
And all my nightly dreams
Are where thy dark eye glances
And where thy footstep gleams 
In what ethereal dances
By what eternal streams

Edgar Allan Poe 18091849


ANNABEL LEE

It was many and many a year ago
In a kingdom by the sea
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabel Lee
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me

I was a child and she was a child
In this kingdom by the sea
But we loved with a love that was more than love
I and my Annabel Lee
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me

And this was the reason that long ago
In this kingdom by the sea
A wind blew out of a cloud chilling
My beautiful Annabel Lee
So that her highborn kinsmen came
And bore her away from me
To shut her up in a sepulcher
In this kingdom by the sea

The angels not half so happy in heaven
Went envying her and me
Yes that was the reason as all men know
In this kingdom by the sea
That the wind came out of the cloud by night
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee

But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we
Of many far wiser than we
And neither the angels in heaven above
Nor the demons down under the sea
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee

For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee
And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee
And so all the nighttide I lie down by the side
Of my darling  my darling  my life and my bride
In the sepulcher there by the sea
In her tomb by the sounding sea

Edgar Allan Poe 18091849


FOR ANNIE

Thank Heaven the crisis 
The danger is past
And the lingering illness
Is over at last 
And the fever called Living
Is conquered at last

Sadly I know
I am shorn of my strength
And no muscle I move
As I lie at full length
But no matter  I feel
I am better at length

And I rest so composedly
Now in my bed
That any beholder
Might fancy me dead 
Might start at beholding me
Thinking me dead

The moaning and groaning
The sighing and sobbing
Are quieted now
With that horrible throbbing
At heart  ah that horrible
Horrible throbbing

The sickness  the nausea 
The pitiless pain 
Have ceased with the fever
That maddened my brain 
With the fever called Living
That burned in my brain

And O of all tortures
That torture the worst
Has abated  the terrible
Torture of thirst
For the naphthaline river
Of Passion accurst 
I have drunk of a water
That quenches all thirst

 Of a water that flows
With a lullaby sound
From a spring but a very few
Feet under ground 
From a cavern not very far
Down under ground

And ah let it never
Be foolishly said
That my room it is gloomy
And narrow my bed
For man never slept
In a different bed 
And to sleep you must slumber
In just such a bed

My tantalized spirit
Here blandly reposes
Forgetting or never
Regretting its roses 
Its old agitations
Of myrtles and roses

For now while so quietly
Lying it fancies
A holier odor
About it of pansies 
A rosemary odor
Commingled with pansies 
With rue and the beautiful
Puritan pansies

And so it lies happily
Bathing in many
A dream of the truth
And the beauty of Annie 
Drowned in a bath
Of the tresses of Annie

She tenderly kissed me
She fondly caressed
And then I fell gently
To sleep on her breast 
Deeply to sleep
From the heaven of her breast

When the light was extinguished
She covered me warm
And she prayed to the angels
To keep me from harm 
To the queen of the angels
To shield me from harm

And I lie so composedly
Now in my bed
Knowing her love
That you fancy me dead 
And I rest so contentedly
Now in my bed
With her love at my breast
That you fancy me dead 
That you shudder to look at me
Thinking me dead

But my heart it is brighter
Than all of the many
Stars in the sky
For it sparkles with Annie 
It glows with the light
Of the love of my Annie 
With the thought of the light
Of the eyes of my Annie

Edgar Allan Poe 18091849


TELLING THE BEES

Here is the place right over the hill
Runs the path I took
You can see the gap in the old wall still
And the steppingstones in the shallow brook

There is the house with the gate redbarred
And the poplars tall
And the barns brown length and the cattleyard
And the white horns tossing above the wall

There are the beehives ranged in the sun
And down by the brink
Of the brook are her poor flowers weedoerrun
Pansy and daffodil rose and pink

A year has gone as the tortoise goes
Heavy and slow
And the same rose blows and the same sun glows
And the same brook sings of a year ago

Theres the same sweet cloversmell in the breeze
And the June sun warm
Tangles his wings of fire in the trees
Setting as then over Fernside farm

I mind me how with a lovers care
From my Sunday coat
I brushed off the burrs and smoothed my hair
And cooled at the brookside my brow and throat

Since we parted a month had passed 
To love a year
Down through the beeches I looked at last
On the little red gate and the wellsweep near

I can see it all now  the slantwise rain
Of light through the leaves
The sundowns blaze on her windowpane
The bloom of her roses under the eaves

Just the same as a month before 
The house and the trees
The barns brown gable the vine by the door 
Nothing changed but the hives of bees

Before them under the garden wall
Forward and back
Went drearily singing the choregirl small
Draping each hive with a shred of black

Trembling I listened the summer sun
Had the chill of snow
For I knew she was telling the bees of one
Gone on the journey we all must go

Then I said to myself My Mary weeps
For the dead today
Haply her blind old grandsire sleeps
The fret and the pain of his age away

But her dog whined low on the doorway sill
With his cane to his chin
The old man sat and the choregirl still
Sung to the bees stealing out and in

And the song she was singing ever since
In my ears sounds on 
Stay at home pretty bees fly not hence
Mistress Mary is dead and gone

John Greenleaf Whittier 18071892


A TRYST

I will not break the tryst my dear
That we have kept so long
Though winter and its snows are here
And Ive no heart for song

You went into the voiceless night
Your path led far away
Did you forget me Hearts Delight
As night forgets the day

Sometimes I think that you would speak
If still you held me dear
But space is vast and I am weak 
Perchance I do not hear

Surely howeer remote the star
Your wandering feet may tread
When I shall pass the sundering bar
Our souls must still be wed

Louise Chandler Moulton 18351908


LOVES RESURRECTION DAY

Round among the quiet graves
When the sun was low
Love went grieving  Love who saves
Did the sleepers know

At his touch the flowers awoke
At his tender call
Birds into sweet singing broke
And it did befall

From the blooming bursting sod
All Loves dead arose
And went flying up to God
By a way Love knows

Louise Chandler Moulton 18351908


HEAVEN

Only to find Forever blest
By thine encircling arm
Only to lie beyond unrest
In passions dreamy calm

Only to meet and never part
To sleep and never wake 
Heart unto heart and soul to soul
Dead for each others sake

Martha Gilbert Dickinson 18 


JANETTES HAIR

Oh loosen the snood that you wear Janette
Let me tangle a hand in your hair  my pet
For the world to me had no daintier sight
Than your brown hair veiling your shoulders white
Your beautiful dark brown hair  my pet

It was brown with a golden gloss Janette
It was finer than silk of the floss  my pet
Twas a beautiful mist falling down to your wrist
Twas a thing to be braided and jewelled and kissed 
Twas the loveliest hair in the world  my pet

My arm was the arm of a clown Janette
It was sinewy bristled and brown  my pet
But warmly and softly it loved to caress
Your round white neck and your wealth of tress
Your beautiful plenty of hair  my pet

Your eyes had a swimming glory Janette
Revealing the old dear story  my pet
They were gray with that chastened tinge of the sky
When the trout leaps quickest to snap the fly
And they matched with your golden hair  my pet

Your lips  but I have no words Janette 
They were fresh as the twitter of birds  my pet
When the spring is young and the roses are wet
With the dewdrops in each red bosom set
And they suited your gold brown hair  my pet

Oh you tangled my life in your hair Janette
Twas a silken and golden snare  my pet
But so gentle the bondage my soul did implore
The right to continue your slave evermore
With my fingers enmeshed in your hair  my pet

Thus ever I dream what you were Janette
With your lips and your eyes and your hair  my pet
In the darkness of desolate years I moan
And my tears fall bitterly over the stone
That covers your golden hair  my pet

Charles Graham Halpine 18291868


THE DYING LOVER

The grass that is under me now
Will soon be over me Sweet
When you walk this way again
I shall not hear your feet

You may walk this way again
And shed your tears like dew
They will be no more to me then
Than mine are now to you

Richard Henry Stoddard 18251903


WHEN THE GRASS SHALL COVER ME

When the grass shall cover me
Head to foot where I am lying
When not any wind that blows
Summer blooms nor winter snows
Shall awake me to your sighing
Close above me as you pass
You will say How kind she was
You will say How true she was
When the grass grows over me

When the grass shall cover me
Holden close to earths warm bosom 
While I laugh or weep or sing
Nevermore for anything
You will find in blade and blossom
Sweet small voices odorous
Tender pleaders in my cause
That shall speak me as I was 
When the grass grows over me

When the grass shall cover me
Ah beloved in my sorrow
Very patient I can wait
Knowing that or soon or late
There will dawn a clearer morrow
When your heart will moan Alas
Now I know how true she was
Now I know how dear she was 
When the grass grows over me

Ina Donna Coolbrith 18421928


GIVE LOVE TODAY

When the lean gray grasses
Cover me bury me deep
No sea wind that passes
Shall break my sleep

When you come my lover
Sorrowfuleyed to me
Earth mine eyes will cover
I shall not see

Though with sad words splendid
Praising you call me dear
It will be all ended
I shall not hear

You may live loves riot
Laughingly over my head
But I shall lie quiet
With the gray dead

Love you will not wake me
With all your singing carouse
Nor your dancing shake me
In my dark house

Though you should go weeping
Sorrowful for my sake
Fain to break my sleeping
I could not wake

Now ere time destroy us 
Shadows beneath and above
Death has no song joyous
Nor dead men love 

Now while deepeyed golden
Love on the mountain sings
Let him be close holden
Fetter his wings

Love nor joy nor sorrow
Troubles the end of day
Leave the Fates tomorrow
Give Love today

Ethel Talbot 18 


UNTIL DEATH

Make me no vows of constancy dear friend
To love me though I die thy whole life long
And love no other till thy days shall end 
Nay it were rash and wrong

If thou canst love another be it so
I would not reach out of my quiet grave
To bind thy heart if it should choose to go 
Love should not be a slave

My placid ghost I trust will walk serene
In clearer light than gilds those earthly morns
Above the jealousies and envies keen
Which sow this life with thorns

Thou wouldst not feel my shadowy caress
If after death my soul should linger here
Mens hearts crave tangible close tenderness
Loves presence warm and near

It would not make me sleep more peacefully
That thou wert wasting all thy life in woe
For my poor sake what love thou hast for me
Bestow it ere I go

Carve not upon a stone when I am dead
The praises which remorseful mourners give
To womens graves  a tardy recompense 
But speak them while I live

Heap not the heavy marble oer my head
To shut away the sunshine and the dew
Let small blooms grow there and let grasses wave
And raindrops filter through

Thou wilt meet many fairer and more gay
Than I but trust me thou canst never find
One who will love and serve thee night and day
With a more single mind

Forget me when I die The violets
Above my breast will blossom just as blue
Nor miss thy tears een natures self forgets
But while I live be true

Elizabeth Akers 18321911


FLORENCE VANE

I loved thee long and dearly
Florence Vane
My lifes bright dream and early
Hath come again
I renew in my fond vision
My hearts dear pain 
My hopes and thy derision
Florence Vane

The ruin lone and hoary
The ruin old
Where thou didst hark my story
At even told 
That spot  the hues Elysian
Of sky and plain 
I treasure in my vision
Florence Vane

Thou wast lovelier than the roses
In their prime
Thy voice excelled the closes
Of sweetest rhyme
Thy heart was as a river
Without a main
Would I had loved thee never
Florence Vane

But fairest coldest wonder
Thy glorious clay
Lieth the green sod under 
Alas the day
And it boots not to remember
Thy disdain
To quicken loves pale ember
Florence Vane

The lilies of the valley
By young graves weep
The daisies love to dally
Where maidens sleep
May their bloom in beauty vying
Never wane
Where thine earthly part is lying
Florence Vane

Philip Pendleton Cooke 18161850


IF SPIRITS WALK

If spirits walk love when the night climbs slow
The slant footpath where we were wont to go
Be sure that I shall take the selfsame way
To the hillcrest and shoreward down the gray
Sheer graveled slope where vetches straggling grow
Look for me not when gusts of winter blow
When at thy pane beat hands of sleet and snow
I would not come thy dear eyes to affray
If spirits walk

But when in June the pines are whispering low
And when their breath plays with thy bright hair so
As some ones fingers once were used to play 
That hour when birds leave song and children pray
Keep the old tryst sweetheart and thou shalt know
If spirits walk

Sophie Jewett 18611909


REQUIESCAT

Tread lightly she is near
Under the snow
Speak gently she can hear
The daisies grow

All her bright golden hair
Tarnished with rust
She that was young and fair
Fallen to dust

Lilylike white as snow
She hardly knew
She was a woman so
Sweetly she grew

Coffinboard heavy stone
Lie on her breast
I vex my heart alone
She is at rest

Peace peace she cannot hear
Lyre or sonnet
All my lifes buried here 
Heap earth upon it

Oscar Wilde 18561900


LYRIC
Ah dans ces mornes sejours
Les jamais sont les toujours  Paul Verlaine

You would have understood me had you waited
I could have loved you dear as well as he
Had we not been impatient dear and fated
Always to disagree

What is the use of speech Silence were fitter
Lest we should still be wishing things unsaid
Though all the words we ever spake were bitter
Shall I reproach you dead

Nay let this earth your portion likewise cover
All the old anger setting us apart
Always in all in truth was I your lover
Always I held your heart

I have met other women who were tender
As you were cold dear with a grace as rare
Think you I turned to them or made surrender
I who had found you fair

Had we been patient dear ah had you waited
I had fought death for you better than he
But from the very first dear we were fated
Always to disagree

Late late I come to you now death discloses
Love that in life was not to be our part
On your lowlying mound between the roses
Sadly I cast my heart

I would not waken you nay this is fitter
Death and the darkness give you unto me
Here we who loved so were so cold and bitter
Hardly can disagree

Ernest Dowson 18671900


ROMANCE

My Love dwelt in a Northern land
A gray tower in a forest green
Was hers and far on either hand
The long wash of the waves was seen
And leagues and leagues of yellow sand
The woven forest boughs between

And through the silver Northern night
The sunset slowly died away
And herds of strange deer lilywhite
Stole forth among the branches gray
About the coming of the light
They fled like ghosts before the day

I know not if the forest green
Still girdles round that castle gray
I know not if the boughs between
The white deer vanish ere the day
Above my Love the grass is green
My heart is colder than the clay

Andrew Lang 18441912


GOODNIGHT

Goodnight dear friend I say goodnight to thee
Across the moonbeams tremulous and white
Bridging all space between us it may be
Lean low sweet friend it is the last goodnight

For lying low upon my couch and still
The fever flush evanished from my face
I heard them whisper softly Tis His will
Angels will give her happier restingplace

And so from sight of tears that fell like rain
And sounds of sobbing smothered close and low
I turned my white face to the windowpane
To say goodnight to thee before I go

Goodnight goodnight I do not fear the end
The conflict with the billows dark and high
And yet if I could touch thy hand my friend
I think it would be easier to die

If I could feel through all the quiet waves
Of my deep hair thy tender breath athrill
I could go downward to the place of graves
With eyes ashine and pale lips smiling still

Or it may be that if through all the strife
And pain of parting I should hear thy call
I would come singing back to sweet sweet life
And know no mystery of death at all

It may not be Goodnight dear friend goodnight
And when you see the violets again
And hear through boughs with swollen buds awhite
The gentle falling of the April rain

Remember her whose young life held thy name
With all things holy in its outward flight
And turn sometimes from busy haunts of men
To hear again her low goodnight goodnight

Hester A Benedict 18 


REQUIESCAT

Bury me deep when I am dead
Far from the woods where sweet birds sing
Lap me in sullen stone and lead
Lest my poor dust should feel the Spring

Never a flower be near me set
Nor starry cup nor slender stem
Anemone nor violet
Lest my poor dust remember them

And you  wherever you may fare 
Dearer than birds or flowers or dew 
Never ah me pass never there
Lest my poor dust should dream of you

Rosamund Marriott Watson 18631911


THE FOUR WINDS

Wind of the North
Wind of the Norland snows
Wind of the winnowed skies and sharp clear stars 
Blow cold and keen across the naked hills
And crisp the lowland pools with crystal films
And blur the casementsquares with glittering ice
But go not near my love

Wind of the West
Wind of the few far clouds
Wind of the gold and crimson sunset lands 
Blow fresh and pure across the peaks and plains
And broaden the blue spaces of the heavens
And sway the grasses and the mountain pines
But let my dear one rest

Wind of the East
Wind of the sunrise seas
Wind of the clinging mists and gray harsh rains 
Blow moist and chill across the wastes of brine
And shut the sun out and the moon and stars
And lash the boughs against the dripping eaves
Yet keep thou from my love

But thou sweet wind
Wind of the fragrant South
Wind from the bowers of jasmine and of rose 
Over magnolia glooms and lilied lakes
And flowering forests come with dewy wings
And stir the petals at her feet and kiss
The low mound where she lies

Charles Henry Luders 18581891


THE KINGS BALLAD

Good my King in your garden close
Hark to the thrushs trilling
Why so sad when the maiden rose
Love at your feet is spilling
Golden the air and honeysweet
Sapphire the sky it is not meet
Sorrowful faces should flowers greet
Hark to the thrushs trilling

All alone walks the King today
Hark to the thrushs trilling
Far from his throne he steals away
Loneness and quiet willing
Roses and tulips and lilies fair
Smile for his pleasure everywhere
Yet of their joyance he takes no share
Hark to the thrushs trilling

Ladies wait in the palace Sire
Hark to the thrushs trilling
Red and white for the kings desire
Lovewarm and sweet and thrilling
Breasts of moonshine and hair of night
Glances amorous soft and bright
Nothing is lacking for your delight
Hark to the thrushs trilling

Kneels the King in a grassy place
Hark to the thrushs trilling
Little flowers under his face
With his warm tears are filling
Says the King Here my heart lies dead
Where my fair love is buried
Would I were lying here instead
Hark to the thrushs trilling

Joyce Kilmer 18861918


HELIOTROPE

Amid the chapels chequered gloom
She laughed with Dora and with Flora
And chattered in the lectureroom 
That saucy little sophomora
Yet while as in her other schools
She was a privileged transgressor
She never broke the simple rules
Of one particular professor

But when he spoke of varied lore
Paroxytones and modes potential
She listened with a face that wore
A look half fond half reverential
To her that earnest voice was sweet
And though her love had no confessor
Her girlish heart lay at the feet
Of that particular professor

And he had learned among his books
That held the lore of ages olden
To watch those everchanging looks
The wistful eyes the tresses golden
That stirred his pulse with passions pain
And thrilled his soul with soft desire
And bade fond youth return again
Crowned with its coronet of fire

Her sunny smile her winsome ways
Were more to him than all his knowledge
And she preferred his words of praise
To all the honors of the college
Yet What am foolish I to him
She whispered to her hearts confessor
She thinks me old and gray and grim
In silence pondered the professor

Yet once when Christmas bells were rung
Above ten thousand solemn churches
And swelling anthems grandly sung
Pealed through the dim cathedral arches 
Ere home returning filled with hope
Softly she stole by gate and gable
And a sweet spray of heliotrope
Left on his littered studytable

Nor came she more from day to day
Like sunshine through the shadows rifting
Above her grave far far away
The eversilent snows were drifting
And those who mourned her winsome face
Found in its stead a swift successor
And loved another in her place 
All save the silent old professor

But in the tender twilight gray
Shut from the sight of carping critic
His lonely thoughts would often stray
From Vedic verse and tongues Semitic
Bidding the ghost of vanished hope
Mock with its past the sad possessor
Of the dead spray of heliotrope
That once she gave the old professor

Harry Thurston Peck 18561914


LYDIA IS GONE THIS MANY A YEAR

Lydia is gone this many a year
Yet when the lilacs stir
In the old gardens far or near
This house is full of her

They climb the twisted chamber stair
Her picture haunts the room
On the carved shelf beneath it there
They heap the purple bloom

A ghost so long has Lydia been
Her cloak upon the wall
Broidered and gilt and faded green
Seems not her cloak at all

The book the box on mantle laid
The shells in a pale row
Are those of some dim little maid
A thousand years ago

And yet the house is full of her
She goes and comes again
And longings thrill and memories stir
Like lilacs in the rain

Out in their yards the neighbors walk
Among the blossoms tall
Of Anne of Phyllis do they talk
Of Lydia not at all

Lizette Woodworth Reese 18561935


AFTER

Oh the littles that remain
Scent of mint out in the lane
Flare of window sound of bees 
These but these

Three times sitting down to bread
One time climbing up to bed
Tablesetting oer and oer
Drying herbs for winters store
This thing that thing  nothing more

But just now out in the lane
Oh the scent of mint was plain

Lizette Woodworth Reese 18561935


MEMORIES

Of my ould loves of their ould ways
I sit an think these bitther days

Ive kissed  gainst rason an gainst rhyme 
More mouths than one in my mad time

Of their soft ways an words I dream
But far off now in faith they seem

Wid betther lives wid betther men
Theyve all long taken up again

For me an mine theyre past an done 
Aye all but one  yes all but one

Since I kissed her neath Tullagh Hill
That one gerrl stays close wid me still

Och up to mine her face still lifts
An round us still the white May drifts

An her soft arm in some ould way
Is here beside me night an day

But faith twas her they buried deep
Wid all that love she couldnt keep

Aye deep an cold in Killinkere
This many a year  this many a year

Arthur Stringer 1874


TO DIANE

The ruddy poppies bend and bow
Diane do you remember
The sun you knew shines proudly now
The lake still lists the breezes vow
Your towers are fairer for their stains
Each stone you smiled upon remains
Sing low  where is Diane
Diane do you remember

I come to find you through the years
Diane do you remember
For none may rule my loves soft fears
The ladies now are not your peers
I seek you through your tarnished halls
Pale sorrow on my spirit falls
High low  where is Diane
Diane do you remember

I crush the poppies where I tread
Diane do you remember
Your flower of life so bright so red 
She does not hear  Diane is dead
I pace the sunny bowers alone
Where naught of her remains but stone
Sing low  where is Diane
Diane does not remember

Helen Hay Whitney 18 


MUSIC I HEARD

Music I heard with you was more than music
And bread I broke with you was more than bread
Now that I am without you all is desolate
All that was once so beautiful is dead

Your hands once touched this table and this silver
And I have seen your fingers hold this glass
These things do not remember you beloved
And yet your touch upon them will not pass

For it was in my heart you moved among them
And blessed them with your hands and with your eyes
And in my heart they will remember always
They knew you once O beautiful and wise

Conrad Aiken 1889


HER DWELLINGPLACE

Amid the fairest things that grow
My lady hath her dwellingplace
Where runnels flow and frail buds blow
As shy and pallid as her face

The wild bright creatures of the wood
About her fearless flit and spring
To light her dusky solitude
Comes Aprils earliest offering

The calm Night from her urn of rest
Pours downward an unbroken stream
All day upon her mothers breast
My lady lieth in a dream

Love could not chill her low soft bed
With any sad memorial stone
He put a red rose at her head 
A flame as fragrant as his own

Ada Foster Murray 18571936


THE WIFE FROM FAIRYLAND

Her talk was all of woodland things
Of little lives that pass
Away in one green afternoon
Deep in the haunted grass

For she had come from fairyland
The morning of a day
When the world that still was April
Was turning into May

Green leaves and silence and two eyes 
Twas so she seemed to me
A silver shadow of the woods
Whisper and mystery

I looked into her woodland eyes
And all my heart was hers
And then I led her by the hand
Home up my marble stairs

And all my granite and my gold
Was hers for her green eyes
And all my sinful heart was hers
From sunset to sunrise

I gave her all delight and ease
That God had given to me
I listened to fulfil her dreams
Rapt with expectancy

But all I gave and all I did
Brought but a weary smile
Of gratitude upon her face
As though a little while

She loitered in magnificence
Of marble and of gold
And waited to be home again
When the dull tale was told

Sometimes in the chill galleries
Unseen she deemed unheard
I found her dancing like a leaf
And singing like a bird

So lone a thing I never saw
In lonely earth or sky
So merry and so sad a thing
One sad one laughing eye

There came a day when on her heart
A wildwood blossom lay
And the world that still was April
Was turning into May

In the green eyes I saw a smile
That turned my heart to stone
My wife that came from fairyland
No longer was alone

For there had come a little hand
To show the green way home
Home through the leaves home through the dew
Home through the greenwood  home

Richard Le Gallienne 1866


IN THE FALL O YEAR

I went back an oldtime lane
In the fall o year
There was wind and bitter rain
And the leaves were sere

Once the birds were lilting high
In a faroff May 
I remember you and I
Were as glad as they

But the branches now are bare
And the lad you knew
Long ago was buried there 
Long ago with you

Thomas S Jones Jr 18821932


THE INVISIBLE BRIDE

The lowvoiced girls that go
In gardens of the Lord
Like flowers of the field they grow
In sisterly accord

Their whispering feet are white
Along the leafy ways
They go in whirls of light
Too beautiful for praise

And in their band forsooth
Is one to set me free 
The one that touched my youth 
The one God gave to me

She kindles the desire
Whereby the gods survive 
The white ideal fire
That keeps my soul alive

Now at the wondrous hour
She leaves her star supreme
And comes in the nights still power
To touch me with a dream

Sibyl of mystery
On roads beyond our ken
Softly she comes to me
And goes to God again

Edwin Markham 1852


RAIN ON A GRAVE

Clouds spout upon her
Their waters amain
In ruthless disdain 
Her who but lately
Had shivered with pain
As at touch of dishonor
If there had lit on her
So coldly so straightly
Such arrows of rain

She who to shelter
Her delicate head
Would quicken and quicken
Each tentative tread
If drops chanced to pelt her
That summertime spills
In dustpaven rills
When thunderclouds thicken
And birds close their bills

Would that I lay there
And she were housed here
Or better together
Were folded away there
Exposed to one weather
We both  who would stray there
When sunny the day there
Or evening was clear
At the prime of the year

Soon will be growing
Green blades from her mound
And daisies be showing
Like stars on the ground
Till she form part of them 
Ay  the sweet heart of them
Loved beyond measure
With a childs pleasure
All her lifes round

Thomas Hardy 18401928


PATTERNS

I walk down the garden paths
And all the daffodils
Are blowing and the bright blue squills
I walk down the patterned gardenpaths
In my stiff brocaded gown
With my powdered hair and jewelled fan
I too am a rare
Pattern As I wander down
The garden paths

My dress is richly figured
And the train
Makes a pink and silver stain
On the gravel and the thrift
Of the borders
Just a plate of current fashion
Tripping by in highheeled ribboned shoes
Not a softness anywhere about me
Only whalebone and brocade
And I sink on a seat in the shade
Of a limetree For my passion
Wars against the stiff brocade
The daffodils and squills
Flutter in the breeze
As they please
And I weep
For the limetree is in blossom
And one small flower has dropped upon my bosom

And the plashing of waterdrops
In the marble fountain
Comes down the gardenpaths
The dripping never stops
Underneath my stiffened gown
Is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble basin
A basin in the midst of hedges grown
So thick she cannot see her lover hiding
But she guesses he is near
And the sliding of the water
Seems the stroking of a dear
Hand upon her
What is Summer in a fine brocaded gown
I should like to see it lying in a heap upon the ground
All the pink and silver crumpled upon the ground

I would be the pink and silver as I ran along the paths
And he would stumble after
Bewildered by my laughter
I should see the sun flashing from his swordhilt and the buckles on his shoes
I would choose
To lead him in a maze along the patterned paths
A bright and laughing maze for my heavybooted lover
Till he caught me in the shade
And the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he clasped me
Aching melting unafraid
With the shadows of the leaves and the sundrops
And the plopping of the waterdrops
All about us in the open afternoon 
I am very like to swoon
With the weight of this brocade
For the sun sifts through the shade

Underneath the fallen blossom
In my bosom
Is a letter I have hid
It was brought to me this morning by a rider from the Duke
Madam we regret to inform you that Lord Hartwell
Died in action Thursday sennight
As I read it in the white morning sunlight
The letters squirmed like snakes
Any answer Madam said my footman
No I told him
See that the messenger takes some refreshment
No no answer
And I walked into the garden
Up and down the patterned paths
In my stiff correct brocade
The blue and yellow flowers stood up proudly in the sun
Each one
I stood upright too
Held rigid to the pattern
By the stiffness of my gown
Up and down I walked
Up and down

In a month he would have been my husband
In a month here underneath this lime
We would have broke the pattern
He for me and I for him
He as Colonel I as Lady
On this shady seat
He had a whim
That sunlight carried blessing
And I answered It shall be as you have said
Now he is dead

In Summer and in Winter I shall walk
Up and down
The patterned gardenpaths
In my stiff brocaded gown
The squills and daffodils
Will give place to pillared roses and to asters and to snow
I shall go
Up and down
In my gown
Gorgeously arrayed
Boned and stayed
And the softness of my body will be guarded from embrace
By each button hook and lace
For the man who should loose me is dead
Fighting with the Duke in Flanders
In a pattern called a war
Christ What are patterns for

Amy Lowell 18741925


DUST

When the white flame in us is gone
And we that lost the worlds delight
Stiffen in darkness left alone
To crumble in our separate night

When your swift hair is quiet in death
And through the lips corruption thrust
Has stilled the labor of my breath 
When we are dust when we are dust 

Not dead not undesirous yet
Still sentient still unsatisfied
Well ride the air and shine and flit
Around the places where we died

And dance as dust before the sun
And light of foot and unconfined
Hurry from road to road and run
About the errands of the wind

And every mote on earth or air
Will speed and gleam down later days
And like a secret pilgrim fare
By eager and invisible ways

Nor ever rest nor ever lie
Till beyond thinking out of view
One mote of all the dust thats I
Shall meet one atom that was you

Then in some garden hushed from wind
Warm in a sunsets afterglow
The lovers in the flowers will find
A sweet and strange unquiet grow

Upon the peace and past desiring
So high a beauty in the air
And such a light and such a quiring
And such a radiant ecstasy there

Theyll know not if its fire or dew
Or out of earth or in the height
Singing or flame or scent or hue
Or two that pass in light to light

Out of the garden higher higher   
But in that instant they shall learn
The shattering ecstasy of our fire
And the weak passionless hearts will burn

And faint in that amazing glow
Until the darkness close above
And they will know  poor fools theyll know 
One moment what it is to love

Rupert Brooke 18871915


BALLAD

The roses in my garden
Were white in the noonday sun
But they were dyed with crimson
Before the day was done

All clad in golden armor
To fight the Saladin
He left me in my garden
To weep to sing and spin

When fell the dewy twilight
I heard the wicket grate
There came a ghost who shivered
Beside my garden gate

All clad in golden armor
But dabbled with red dew
He did not lift his vizor
And yet his face I knew

And when he left my garden
The roses all were red
And dyed in a fresh crimson
Only my heart was dead

The roses in my garden
Were white in the noonday sun
But they were dyed with crimson
Before the day was done

Maurice Baring 1874


THE LITTLE ROSE IS DUST MY DEAR

The little rose is dust my dear
The elfin wind is gone
That sang a song of silver words
And cooled our hearts with dawn

And what is left to hope my dear
Or what is left to say
The rose the little wind and you
Have gone so far away

Grace Hazard Conkling 18


DIRGE

Never the nightingale
Oh my dear
Never again the lark
Thou wilt hear
Though dusk and the morning still
Tap at thy windowsill
Though ever love call and call
Thou wilt not hear at all
My dear my dear

Adelaide Crapsey 18781914


THE LITTLE RED RIBBON

The little red ribbon the ring and the rose
The summertime comes and the summertime goes 
And never a blossom in all of the land
As white as the gleam of her beckoning hand

The long winter months and the glare of the snows
The little red ribbon the ring and the rose
And never a glimmer of sun in the skies
As bright as the light of her glorious eyes

Dreams only are true but they fade and are gone 
For her face is not here when I waken at dawn
The little red ribbon the ring and the rose
Mine only hers only the dream and repose

I am weary of waiting and weary of tears
And my heart wearies too all these desolate years
Moaning over the one only song that it knows 
The little red ribbon the ring and the rose

James Whitcomb Riley 18491916


THE ROSARY

The hours I spent with thee dear heart
Are as a string of pearls to me
I count them over every one apart
My rosary

Each hour a pearl each pearl a prayer
To still a heart in absence wrung
I tell each bead unto the end and there
A cross is hung

Oh memories that bless  and burn
Oh barren gain  and bitter loss
I kiss each bead and strive at last to learn
To kiss the cross
Sweetheart
To kiss the cross

Robert Cameron Rogers 18621912







LOVES FULFILMENT






MY TRUELOVE HATH MY HEART
From the Arcadia

My truelove hath my heart and I have his
By just exchange one for the other given
I hold his dear and mine he cannot miss
There never was a better bargain driven
His heart in me keeps him and me in one
My heart in him his thoughts and senses guides
He loves my heart for once it was his own
I cherish his because in me it bides

His heart his wound received from my sight
My heart was wounded from his wounded heart
For as from me on him his hurt did light
So still me thought in me his heart did smart
Both equal hurt in this change sought our bliss
My true love hath my heart and I have his

Philip Sidney 15541586


SONG

O sweet delight O more than human bliss
With her to live that ever loving is
To hear her speak whose words are so well placed
That she by them as they in her are graced
Those looks to view that feast the viewers eye
How blest is he that may so live and die

Such love as this the Golden Times did know
When all did reap yet none took care to sow
Such love as this an endless summer makes
And all distaste from frail affection takes
So loved so blest in my beloved am I
Which till their eyes ache let iron men envy

Thomas Campion   1619


THE GOODMORROW

I wonder by my troth what thou and I
Did till we loved were we not weaned till then
But sucked on country pleasures childishly
Or snored we in the Seven Sleepers den
Twas so but this all pleasures fancies be
If ever any beauty I did see
Which I desired and got twas but a dream of thee

And now goodmorrow to our waking souls
Which watch not one another out of fear
For love all love of other sights controls
And makes one little room an everywhere
Let seadiscoverers to new worlds have gone
Let maps to other worlds on worlds have shown
Let us possess one world each hath one and is one

My face in thine eye thine in mine appears
And true plain hearts do in the faces rest
Where can we find two fitter hemispheres
Without sharp north without declining west
Whatever dies was not mixed equally
If our two loves be one or thou and I
Love just alike in all none of these loves can die

John Donne 15731631


THERES GOWD IN THE BREAST

Theres gowd in the breast of the primrose pale
An siller in every blossom
Theres riches galore in the breeze of the vale
And health in the wild woods bosom
Then come my love at the hour of joy
When warbling birds sing oer us
Sweet nature for us has no alloy
And the world is all before us

The courtier joys in hustle and power
The soldier in warsteeds bounding
The miser in hoards of treasured ore
The proud in their pomp surrounding
But we hae yon heaven sae bonnie and blue
And laverocks skimming oer us
The breezes of health and the valleys of dew 
Oh the world is all before us

James Hogg 17701835


THE BEGGAR MAID

Her arms across her breast she laid
She was more fair than words can say
Bare footed came the beggar maid
Before the king Cophetua
In robe and crown the king stepped down
To meet and greet her on her way
It is no wonder said the lords
She is more beautiful than day

As shines the moon in clouded skies
She in her poor attire was seen
One praised her ankles one her eyes
One her dark hair and lovesome mien
So sweet a face such angel grace
In all that land had never been
Cophetua sware a royal oath
This beggar maid shall be my queen

Alfred Tennyson 18091892


REFUGE

Twilight a timid fawn went glimmering by
And Night the darkblue hunter followed fast
Ceaseless pursuit and flight were in the sky
But the long chase had ceased for us at last

We watched together while the driven fawn
Hid in the golden thicket of the day
We from whose hearts pursuit and flight were gone
Knew on the hunters breast her refuge lay

A E George William Russell 18671935


AT SUNSET

Clasp her and hold her and love her
Here in the arching green
Of boughs that bend above her
With belts of blue between

Clasp her and hold her and love her
Swift Ere the splendor dies
The blue grows black above her
The earth in shadow lies

Flowers of dream enfold her
Soft Let me bend above
Clasp her and love her and hold her
Clasp her and hold and love

Louis V Ledoux 1880


ONE MORNING OH SO EARLY

One morning oh so early my beloved my beloved
All the birds were singing blithely as if never they would cease
Twas a thrush sang in my garden Hear the story hear the story
And the lark sang Give us glory
And the dove said Give us peace

Then I hearkened oh so early my beloved my beloved
To that murmur from the woodland of the dove my dear the dove
When the nightingale came after Give us fame to sweeten duty
When the wren sang Give us beauty
She made answer Give us love

Sweet is spring and sweet the morning my beloved my beloved
Now for us doth spring doth morning wait upon the years increase
And my prayer goes up Oh give us crowned in youth with marriage glory
Give for all our lifes dear story
Give us love and give us peace

Jean Ingelow 18201897


ACROSS THE DOOR

The fiddles were playing and playing
The couples were out on the floor
From converse and dancing he drew me
And across the door

Ah strange were the dim wide meadows
And strange was the cloudstrewn sky
And strange in the meadows the corncrakes
And they making cry

The hawthorn bloom was by us
Around us the breath of the south
White hawthorn strange in the nighttime 
His kiss on my mouth

Padraic Colum 1881


MAY MARGARET

If you be that May Margaret
That lived on Kendal Green
Then wheres that sunny hair of yours
That crowned you like a queen
That sunny hair is dim lad
They said was like a crown 
The red gold turned to gray lad
The night a ship went down

If you be yet May Margaret
May Margaret now as then
Then wheres that bonny smile of yours
That broke the hearts of men
The bonny smile is wan lad
That once was glad as day 
And oh tis weary smiling
To keep the tears away

If you be that May Margaret
As yet you swear to me
Then wheres that proud cold heart of yours
That sent your love to sea
Ah me that heart is broken
The proud cold heart has bled
For one light word outspoken
For all the love unsaid

Then Margaret my Margaret
If all you say be true
Your hair is yet the sunniest gold
Your eyes the sweetest blue
And dearer yet and fairer yet
For all the coming years 
The fairer for the waiting
The dearer for the tears

Theophile Marzials 1850


RONDEL

Kissing her hair I sat against her feet
Wove and unwove it wound and found it sweet
Made fast therewith her hands drew down her eyes
Deep as deep flowers and dreamy like dim skies
With her own tresses bound and found her fair
Kissing her hair

Sleep were no sweeter than her face to me
Sleep of cold seabloom under the cold sea
What pain could get between my face and hers
What new sweet thing would love not relish worse
Unless perhaps white death had kissed me there
Kissing her hair

Algernon Charles Swinburne 18371909


A SPRING JOURNEY

We journeyed through broad woodland ways
My Love and I
The maples set the shining fields ablaze
The blue May sky
Brought to us its great Spring surprise
While we saw all things through each others eyes

And sometimes from a steep hillside
Shone fair and bright
The shadhush like a young June bride
Fresh clothed in white
Sometimes came glimpses glad of the blue sea
But I smiled only on my Love he smiled on me

The violets made a field one mass of blue 
Even bluer than the sky
The little brook took on that color too
And sang more merrily
Your dress is blue he laughing said Your eyes
My heart sang sweeter than the bending skies

We spoke of poets dead so long ago
And their wise words
We glanced at appletrees like drifted snow
We watched the nesting birds 
Only a moment Ah how short the day
Yet all the winters cannot blow its sweetness quite away

Alice Freeman Palmer 18551902


THE BROOKSIDE

I wandered by the brookside
I wandered by the mill
I could not hear the brook flow 
The noisy wheel was still
There was no burr of grasshopper
No chirp of any bird
But the beating of my own heart
Was all the sound I heard

I sat beneath the elmtree
I watched the long long shade
And as it grew still longer
I did not feel afraid
For I listened for a footfall
I listened for a word 
But the beating of my own heart
Was all the sound I heard

He came not  no he came not 
The night came on alone 
The little stars sat one by one
Each on his golden throne
The evening wind passed by my cheek
The leaves above were stirred 
But the beating of my own heart
Was all the sound I heard

Fast silent tears were flowing
When something stood behind
A hand was on my shoulder 
I knew its touch was kind
It drew me nearer  nearer 
We did not speak one word
For the beating of our own hearts
Was all the sound we heard

Richard Monckton Milnes 18091885


SONG

For me the jasmine buds unfold
And silver daisies star the lea
The crocus hoards the sunset gold
And the wild rose breathes for me
I feel the sap through the bough returning
I share the skylarks transport fine
I know the fountains wayward yearning
I love and the world is mine

I love and thoughts that sometime grieved
Still well remembered grieve not me
From all that darkened and deceived
Upsoars my spirit free
For soft the hours repeat one story
Sings the sea one strain divine
My clouds arise all flushed with glory
I love and the world is mine

Florence Earle Coates 18501927


WHAT MY LOVER SAID

By the merest chance in the twilight gloom
In the orchard path he met me
In the tall wet grass with its faint perfume
And I tried to pass but he made no room
Oh I tried but he would not let me
So I stood and blushed till the grass grew red
With my face bent down above it
While he took my hand as he whispering said 
How the clover lifted each pink sweet head
To listen to all that my lover said
Oh the clover in bloom I love it

In the high wet grass went the path to hide
And the low wet leaves hung over
But I could not pass upon either side
For I found myself when I vainly tried
In the arms of my steadfast lover
And he held me there and he raised my head
While he closed the path before me
And he looked down into my eyes and said 
How the leaves bent down from the boughs oerhead
To listen to all that my lover said
Oh the leaves hanging lowly oer me

Had he moved aside but a little way
I could surely then have passed him
And he knew I never could wish to stay
And would not have heard what he had to say
Could I only aside have cast him
It was almost dark and the moments sped
And the searching night wind found us
But he drew me nearer and softly said 
How the pure sweet wind grew still instead
To listen to all that my lover said
Oh the whispering wind around us

I am sure he knew when he held me fast
That I must be all unwilling
For I tried to go and I would have passed
As the night was come with its dew at last
And the sky with its stars was filling
But he clasped me close when I would have fled
And he made me hear his story
And his soul came out from his lips and said 
How the stars crept out where the white moon led
To listen to all that my lover said
Oh the moon and the stars in glory

I know that the grass and the leaves will not tell
And Im sure that the wind precious rover
Will carry my secret so safely and well
That no being shall ever discover
One word of the many that rapidly fell
From the soulspeaking lips of my lover
And the moon and the stars that looked over
Shall never reveal what a fairylike spell
They wove round about us that night in the dell
In the path through the dewladen clover
Nor echo the whispers that made my heart swell
As they fell from the lips of my lover

Homer Greene 1853


MAYMUSIC

Oh lose the winter from thine heart the darkness from thine eyes
And from the low hearthchair of dreams my LoveoMay arise
And let the maidens robe thee like a white whitelilac tree
Oh hear the call of Spring fair Soul  and wilt thou come with me

Even so and even so
Whither thou goest I will go
I will follow thee

Then wilt thou see the orange trees starflowering over Spain
Or arched and mounded Kaisertowns that molder mid Almain
Or through the cypressgardens go of magic Italy
Oh East or West or South or North say wilt thou come with me

Even so or even so
Whither thou goest I will go
I will follow thee

But wilt thou farther come with me through hawthorn red and white
Until we find the wall that hides the Land of Hearts Delight
The gates all carved with olden things are strange and dread to see
But I will lift thee through fair Soul Arise and come with me

Even so Love even so
Whither thou goest I will go
Lo I follow thee

Rachel Annand Taylor 18 


SONG

Flame at the core of the world
And flame in the red rosetree
The one is the fire of the ancient spheres
The other is Junes to be
And oh theres a flame that is both their flames
Here at the heart of me

As strong as the fires of stars
As the prophet rosetree true
The fire of my life is tender and wild
Its beauty is old and new
For out of the infinite past it came
With the love in the eyes of you

Arthur Upson 18771908


A MEMORY

The night walked down the sky
With the moon in her hand
By the light of that yellow lantern
I saw you stand

The hair that swept your shoulders
Was yellow too
Your feet as they touched the grasses
Shamed the dew

The Night wore all her jewels
And you wore none
But your gown had the odor of lilies
Drenched with sun

And never was Eve of the Garden
Or Mary the Maid
More pure than you as you stood there
Bold yet afraid

And the sleeping birds woke trembling
And the folded flowers were aware
And my senses were faint with the fragrant
Gold of your hair

And our lips found ways of speaking
What words cannot say
Till a hundred nests gave music
And the East was gray

Frederic Lawrence Knowles 18691905


LOVE TRIUMPHANT

Helens lips are drifting dust
Ilion is consumed with rust
All the galleons of Greece
Drink the oceans dreamless peace
Lost was Solomons purple show
Restless centuries ago
Stately empires wax and wane 
Babylon Barbary and Spain 
Only one thing undefaced
Lasts though all the worlds lie waste
And the heavens are overturned
 Dear how long ago we learned

Theres a sight that blinds the sun
Sound that lives when sounds are done
Music that rebukes the birds
Language lovelier than words
Hue and scent that shame the rose
Wine no earthly vineyard knows
Silence stiller than the shore
Swept by Charons stealthy oar
Ocean more divinely free
Than Pacifics boundless sea 
Ye who love have learned it true
 Dear how long ago we knew

Frederic Lawrence Knowles 18691905


LINES

Love within the lovers breast
Burns like Hesper in the West
Oer the ashes of the sun
Till the day and night are done
Then when dawn drives up his car 
Lo it is the morning star

Love thy love pours down on mine
As the sunlight on the vine
As the snow rill on the vale
As the salt breeze on the sail
As the song unto the bird
On my lips thy name is heard

As a dewdrop on the rose
In thy heart my passion glows
As a skylark to the sky
Up into thy breast I fly
As a seashell of the sea
Ever shall I sing of thee

George Meredith 18281909


LOVE AMONG THE RUINS

Where the quietcolored end of evening smiles
Miles and miles
On the solitary pastures where our sheep
Halfasleep
Tinkle homeward through the twilight stray or stop
As they crop 
Was the site once of a city great and gay
So they say
Of our countrys very capital its prince
Ages since
Held his court in gathered councils wielding far
Peace or war

Now  the country does not even boast a tree
As you see
To distinguish slopes of verdure certain rills
From the hills
Intersect and give a name to else they run Into one
Where the domed and daring palace shot its spires
Up like fires
Oer the hundredgated circuit of a wall
Bounding all
Made of marble men might march on nor be pressed
Twelve abreast

And such plenty and perfection see of grass
Never was
Such a carpet as this summertime oerspreads
And embeds
Every vestige of the city guessed alone
Stock or stone 
Where a multitude of men breathed joy and woe
Long ago
Lust of glory pricked their hearts up dread of shame
Struck them tame
And that glory and that shame alike the gold
Bought and sold

Now  the single little turret that remains
On the plains
By the caper overrooted by the gourd
Overscored
While the patching houseleeks head of blossom winks
Through the chinks 
Marks the basement whence a tower in ancient time
Sprang sublime
And a burning ring all round the chariots traced
As they raced
And the monarch and his minions and his dames
Viewed the games

And I know while thus the quietcolored eve
Smiles to leave
To their folding all our manytinkling fleece
In such peace
And the slopes and rills in undistinguished gray
Melt away 
That a girl with eager eyes and yellow hair
Waits me there
In the turret whence the charioteers caught soul
For the goal
When the king looked where she looks now breathless dumb
Till I come

But he looked upon the city every side
Far and wide
All the mountains topped with temples all the glades
Colonnades
All the causeys bridges aqueducts  and then
All the men
When I do come she will speak not she will stand
Either hand
On my shoulder give her eyes the first embrace
Of my face
Ere we rush ere we extinguish sight and speech
Each on each

In one year they sent a million fighters forth
South and North
And they built their gods a brazen pillar high
As the sky
Yet reserved a thousand chariots in full force 
Gold of course
Oh heart oh blood that freezes blood that burns
Earths returns
For whole centuries of folly noise and sin
Shut them in
With their triumphs and their glories and the rest
Love is best

Robert Browning 18121889


EARL MERTOUNS SONG
From The Blot in the Scutcheon

Theres a woman like a dewdrop shes so purer than the purest
And her noble hearts the noblest yes and her sure faiths the surest
And her eyes are dark and humid like the depth on depth of luster
Hid i the harebell while her tresses sunnier than the wildgrape cluster
Gush in goldentinted plenty down her necks rosemisted marble
Then her voices music    call it the wells bubbling the birds warble
And this woman says My days were sunless and my nights were moonless
Parched the pleasant April herbage and the larks hearts outbreak tuneless
If you loved me not And I who ah for words of flame adore her
Who am mad to lay my spirit prostrate palpably before her 
I may enter at her portal soon as now her lattice takes me
And by noontide as by midnight make her mine as hers she makes me

Robert Browning 18121889


MEETING AT NIGHT

The gray sea and the long black land
And the yellow halfmoon large and low
And the startled little waves that leap
In fiery ringlets from their sleep
As I gain the cove with pushing prow
And quench its speed in the slushy sand

Then a mile of warm seascented beach
Three fields to cross till a farm appears
A tap at the pane the quick sharp scratch
And blue spirt of a lighted match
And a voice less loud through its joys and fears
Than the two hearts beating each to each

Robert Browning 18121889


PARTING AT MORNING

Round the cape of a sudden came the sea
And the sun looked over the mountains rim
And straight was a path of gold for him
And the need of a world of men for me

Robert Browning 18121889


THE TURN OF THE ROAD

Soft gray buds on the willow
Warm moist winds from the bay
Seagulls out on the sandy beach
And a road my eager feet would reach
That leads to the Faraway

Dust on the wayside flower
The meadowlarks luring tone
Is silent now from the grasses tipped
With dew at the dawn the pearls have slipped 
Far have I fared alone

And then by the alder thicket
The turn of the road  and you
Though the earth lie white in the noonday heat
Or the swift storm follow our hurrying feet
What do we care  we two

Alice Rollit Coe 18 


MY DELIGHT AND THY DELIGHT

My delight and thy delight
Walking like two angels white
In the gardens of the night

My desire and thy desire
Twining to a tongue of fire
Leaping live and laughing higher

Through the everlasting strife
In the mystery of life

Love from whom the world begun
Hath the secret of the sun

Love can tell and love alone
Whence the million stars were strown
Why each atom knows its own
How in spite of woe and death
Gay is life and sweet is breath

This he taught us this we knew
Happy in his science true
Hand in hand as we stood
Neath the shadows of the wood
Heart to heart as we lay
In the dawning of the day

Robert Bridges 18441930


O SAW YE THE LASS

O saw ye the lass wi the bonny blue een
Her smile is the sweetest that ever was seen
Her cheek like the rose is but fresher I ween
Shes the loveliest lassie that trips on the green
The home of my love is below in the valley
Where wildflowers welcome the wandering bee
But the sweetest of flowers in that spot that is seen
Is the maid that I love wi the bonny blue een

When night overshadows her cot in the glen
Shell steal out to meet her loved Donald again
And when the moon shines on the valley so green
Ill welcome the lass wi the bonny blue een
As the dove that has wandered away from his nest
Returns to the mate his fond heart loves the best
Ill fly from the worlds false and vanishing scene
To my dear one the lass wi the bonny blue een

Richard Ryan 17961849


LOVE AT SEA
Imitated From Theophile Gautier

We are in loves land today
Where shall we go
Love shall we start or stay
Or sail or row
Theres many a wind and way
And never a May but May
We are in loves hand today
Where shall we go

Our landwind is the breath
Of sorrows kissed to death
And joys that were
Our ballast is a rose
Our way lies where God knows
And love knows where
We are in loves hand today 

Our seamen are fledged Loves
Our masts are bills of doves
Our decks fine gold
Our ropes are dead maids hair
Our stores are loveshafts fair
And manifold
We are in loves land today 

Where shall we land you sweet
On fields of strange mens feet
Or fields near home
Or where the fireflowers blow
Or where the flowers of snow
Or flowers of foam
We are in loves hand today 

Land me she says where love
Shows but one shaft one dove
One heart one hand 
A shore like that my dear
Lies where no man will steer
No maiden land

Algernon Charles Swinburne 18371909


MARY BEATONS SONG
From Chastelard

Between the sunset and the sea
My love laid hands and lips on me
Of sweet came sour of day came night
Of long desire came brief delight
Ah love and what thing came of thee
Between the seadowns and the sea

Between the seamark and the sea
Joy grew to grief grief grew to me
Love turned to tears and tears to fire
And dead delight to new desire
Loves talk loves touch there seemed to be
Between the seasand and the sea

Between the sundown and the sea
Love watched one hour of love with me
Then down the allgolden waterways
His feet flew after yesterdays
I saw them come and saw them flee
Between the seafoam and the sea

Between the seastrand and the sea
Love fell on sleep sleep fell on me
The first star saw twain turn to one
Between the moonrise and the sun
The next that saw not love saw me
Between the seabanks and the sea

Algernon Charles Swinburne 18371909


PLIGHTED

Mine to the core of the heart my beauty
Mine all mine and for love not duty
Love given willingly full and free
Love for loves sake  as mine to thee
Dutys a slave that keeps the keys
But Love the master goes in and out
Of his goodly chambers with song and shout
Just as he please  just as he please

Mine from the dear heads crown browngolden
To the silken foot thats scarce beholden
Give to a few friends hand or smile
Like a generous lady now and awhile
But the sanctuary heart that none dare win
Keep holiest of holiest evermore
The crowd in the aisles may watch the door
The highpriest only enters in

Mine my own without doubts or terrors
With all thy goodnesses all thy errors
Unto me and to me alone revealed
A spring shut up a fountain sealed
Many may praise thee  praise mine as thine
Many may love thee  Ill love them too
But thy heart of hearts pure faithful and true
Must be mine mine wholly and only mine

Mine  God I thank Thee that Thou hast given
Something all mine on this side heaven
Something as much myself to be
As this my soul which I lift to Thee
Flesh of my flesh bone of my bone
Life of my life whom Thou dost make
Two to the world for the worlds works sake 
But each unto each as in Thy sight one

Dinah Maria Mulock Craik 18261887


A WOMANS QUESTION

Before I trust my fate to thee
Or place my hand in thine
Before I let thy future give
Color and form to mine
Before I peril all for thee question thy soul tonight for me

I break all slighter bonds nor feel
A shadow of regret
Is there one link within the past
That holds thy spirit yet
Or is thy faith as clear and free as that which I can pledge to thee

Does there within thy dimmest dreams
A possible future shine
Wherein thy life could henceforth breathe
Untouched unshared by mine
If so at any pain or cost O tell me before all is lost

Look deeper still If thou canst feel
Within thy inmost soul
That thou hast kept a portion back
While I have staked the whole
Let no false pity spare the blow but in true mercy tell me so

Is there within thy heart a need
That mine cannot fulfil
One chord that any other hand
Could better wake or still
Speak now  lest at some future day my whole life wither and decay

Lives there within thy nature hid
The demonspirit change
Shedding a passing glory still
On all things new and strange
It may not be thy fault alone  but shield my heart against thy own

Couldst thou withdraw thy hand one day
And answer to my claim
That Fate and that todays mistake 
Not thou  had been to blame
Some soothe their conscience thus but thou wilt surely warn and save me now

Nay answer not  I dare not hear
The words would come too late
Yet I would spare thee all remorse
So comfort thee my Fate 
Whatever on my heart may fall  remember I would risk it all

Adelaide Anne Procter 18251864


DINNA ASK ME

O dinna ask me gin I loe ye
Troth I daurna tell
Dinna ask me gin I loe ye
Ask it o yoursel

O dinna look sae sair at me
For weel ye ken me true
O gin ye look sae sair at me
I daurna look at you

When ye gang to yon braw braw town
And bonnier lassies see
O dinna Jamie look at them
Lest ye should mind na me

For I could never bide the lass
That yed loe mair than me
And O Im sure my heart wad brak
Gin yed prove fause to me

John Dunlop 17551820


A SONG

Sing me a sweet low song of night
Before the moon is risen
A song that tells of the stars delight
Escaped from days bright prison
A song that croons with the crickets voice
That sleeps with the shadowed trees
A song that shall bid my heart rejoice
At its tender mysteries

And then when the song is ended love
Bend down your head unto me
Whisper the word that was born above
Ere the moon had swayed the sea
Ere the oldest star began to shine
Or the farthest sun to burn 
The oldest of words O heart of mine
Yet newest and sweet to learn

Hildegarde Hawthorne 18 


THE REASON

Oh hark the pulses of the night
The crickets hidden in the field
That beat out music of delight
Till summoned dawn stands half revealed

Oh mark above the bearded corn
And the green wheat and bending rye
Tuned to the earth and calling morn
The stars vibrating in the sky

And know divided soul of me
Here in the meadow sweet in speech
This perfect night could never be
Were we not mated each to each

James Oppenheim 18821932


MY OWN CAILIN DONN

The blush is on the flower and the bloom is on the tree
And the bonnie bonnie sweet birds are caroling their glee
And the dews upon the grass are made diamonds by the sun
All to deck a path of glory for my own Cailin Donn

Oh fair she is Oh rare she is Oh dearer still to me
More welcome than the green leaf to winterstricken tree
More welcome than the blossom to the weary dusty bee
Is the coming of my true love  my own Cailin Donn

O sycamore O sycamore wave wave your banners green
Let all your pennons flutter O beech before my queen
Ye fleet and honeyed breezes to kiss her hand ye run
But my heart has passed before ye to my own Cailin Donn

Ring out ring out O linden your merry leafy bells
Unveil your brilliant torches O chestnut to the dells
Strew strew the glade with splendor for morn it cometh on
Oh the morn of all delight to me  my own Cailin Donn

She is coming where we parted where she wanders every day
Theres a gay surprise before her who thinks me far away
Oh like hearing bugles triumph when the fight of freedoms won
Is the joy around your footsteps my own Cailin Donn

George Sigerson 18391925


NOCTURNE

All the earth a hush of white
White with moonlight all the skies
Wonder of a winter night 
And    your eyes

Hues no palette dares to claim
Where the spoils of sunken ships
Leap to light in singing flame 
And    your lips

Darkness as the shadows creep
Where the embers sigh to rest
Silence of a world asleep 
And    your breast

Amelia Josephine Burr 1878


SURRENDER

As I look back upon your first embrace
I understand why from your sudden touch
Angered I sprang and struck you in the face
You asked at once too little and too much
But now that of my spirit you require
Loves very soul that unto death endures
Crown as you will the cup of your desire 
I am all yours

Amelia Josephine Burr 1878


BY YON BURN SIDE

Well meet beside the dusky glen on yon burn side
Where the bushes form a cosie den on yon burn side
Though the broomy knowes be green
And there we may be seen
Yet well meet  well meet at een down by yon burn side

Ill lead thee to the birken bower on yon burn side
Sae sweetly wove wi woodbine flower on yon burn side
There the busy prying eye
Neer disturbs the lovers joy
While in ithers arms they lie down by yon burn side

Awa ye rude unfeeling crew frae yon burn side
Those fairy scenes are no for you by yon burn side
There fancy smooths her theme
By the sweetly murmuring stream
And the rocklodged echoes skim down by yon burn side

Now the plantin taps are tinged wi goud on yon burn side
And gloamin draws her foggy shroud oer yon burn side
Far frae the noisy scene
Ill through the fields alane
There well meet my ain dear Jean down by yon burn side

Robert Tannahill 17741810


A PASTORAL

Flower of the medlar
Crimson of the quince
I saw her at the blossomtime
And loved her ever since
She swept the draughty pleasance
The blooms had left the trees
The whilst the birds sang canticles
In cherry symphonies

Whiteness of the white rose
Redness of the red
She went to cut the blushrose buds
To tie at the altarhead
And some she laid in her bosom
And some around her brows
And as she passed the lilyheads
All becked and made their bows

Scarlet of the poppy
Yellow of the corn
The men were at the garnering
Ashouting in the morn
I chased her to a pippintree 
The waking birds all whist 
And oh it was the sweetest kiss
That I have ever kissed

Marjorie mint and violets
Adrying round us set
Twas all done in the faienceroom
Aspicing marmalet
On one tile was a satyr
On one a nymph at bay
Methinks the birds will scarce be home
To wake our weddingday

Theophile Marzials 1850


WHEN DEATH TO EITHER SHALL COME

When Death to either shall come 
I pray it be first to me 
Be happy as ever at home
If so as I wish it be

Possess thy heart my own
And sing to thy child on thy knee
Or read to thyself alone
The songs that I made for thee

Robert Bridges 18441930


THE RECONCILIATION
From The Princess

As through the land at eve we went
And plucked the ripened ears
We fell out my wife and I
O we fell out I know not why
And kissed again with tears

And blessings on the falling out
That all the more endears
When we fall out with those we love
And kiss again with tears

For when we came where lies the child
We lost in other years
There above the little grave
O there above the little grave
We kissed again with tears

Alfred Tennyson 18091892


SONG

Wait but a little while 
The bird will bring
A heart in tune for melodies
Unto the spring
Till he whos in the cedar there
Is moved to trill a song so rare
And pipe her fair

Wait but a little while 
The bud will break
The inner rose will open and glow
For summers sake
Fond bees will lodge within her breast
Till she herself is plucked and pressed
Where I would rest

Wait but a little while 
The maid will grow
Gracious with lips and hands to thee
With breast of snow
Today Loves mute but time hath sown
A soul in her to match thine own
Though yet ungrown

Norman Gale 1862


CONTENT

Though singing but the shy and sweet
Untrod by multitudes of feet
Songs bounded by the brook and wheat
I have not failed in this
The only lure my woodland note
To win all Englands whitest throat
O bards in gold and fire who wrote
Be yours all other bliss

Norman Gale 1862


CHE SARA SARA

Preach wisdom unto him who understands
When theres such lovely longing in thine eyes
And such a pulse in thy small clinging hands
What is the good of being great or wise

What is the good of beating up the dust
On the worlds highway vexed with droughty heat
Oh I grow fatalist  what must be must
Seeing that thou beloved art so sweet

Victor Plarr 1863


BID ADIEU TO GIRLISH DAYS

Bid adieu adieu adieu
Bid adieu to girlish days
Happy Love is come to woo
Thee and woo thy girlish ways 
The zone that doth become thee fair
The snood upon thy yellow hair

When thou hast heard his name upon
The bugles of the cherubim
Begin thou softly to unzone
Thy girlish bosom unto him
And softly to undo the snood
That is the sign of maidenhood

James Joyce 1882


TO F C

Fast falls the snow O lady mine
Sprinkling the lawn with crystals fine
But by the gods we wont repine
While were together
Well chat and rhyme and kiss and dine
Defying weather

So stir the fire and pour the wine
And let those seagreen eyes divine
Pour their lovemadness into mine
I dont care whether
Tis snow or sun or rain or shine
If were together

Mortimer Collins 18271876


SPRING PASSION

Blue sky green fields and lazy yellow sun
Why should I hunger for the burning South
Where beauty needs no travail to be won
Now I may kiss her pure impassioned mouth

Winds rippling with the rich delight of spring
Why should I yearn for myriadcolored skies
Lit by auroral suns when I may sing
The flame and rapture of her starry eyes

Oh song of birds and flowers fair to see
Why should I thirst for faroff Edenisles
When I may hear her discourse melody
And bask a dreamer in her dreamy smiles

Joel Elias Spingarn 1875


ADVICE TO A LOVER

Oh if you love her
Show her the best of you
So will you move her
To bear with the rest of you
Coldness and jealousy
Cannot but seem to her
Signs that a tempest lurks
Where was sunbeam to her
Patience and tenderness
Still will awake in her
Hopes of new sunshine
Though the storm break for her
Love she will know for her
Like the blue firmament
Under the tempest lies
Gentle and permanent
Nor will she ever
Gentleness find the less
When the storm overblown
Leaveth clear kindliness
Deal with her tenderly
Skylike above her
Smile on her waywardness
Oh if you love her

S Charles Jellicoe 18 


YES

They stood above the world
In a world apart
And she dropped her happy eyes
And stilled the throbbing pulses
Of her happy heart
And the moonlight fell above her
Her secret to discover
And the moonbeams kissed her hair
As though no human lovers
Had laid his kisses there

Look up brown eyes he said
And answer mine
Lift up those silken fringes
That hide a happy light
Almost divine
The jealous moonlight drifted
To the finger halfuplifted
Where shone the opal ring 
Where the colors danced and shifted
On the pretty changeful thing

Just the old old story
Of light and shade
Love like the opal tender
Like it may be to vary 
May be to fade
Just the old tender story
Just a glimpse of morning glory
In an earthly Paradise
With shadowy reflections
In a pair of sweet brown eyes

Brown eyes a man might well
Be proud to win
Open to hold his image
Shut under silken lashes
Only to shut him in
O glad eyes look together
For lifes dark stormy weather
Grows to a fairer thing
When young eyes look upon it
Through a slender wedding ring

Richard Doddridge Blackmore 18251900


LOVE

All thoughts all passions all delights
Whatever stirs this mortal frame
All are but ministers of Love
And feed his sacred flame

Oft in my waking dreams do I
Live oer again that happy hour
When midway on the mount I lay
Beside the ruined tower

The moonshine stealing oer the scene
Had blended with the lights of eve
And she was there my hope my joy
My own dear Genevieve

She leaned against the armed man
The statue of the armed Knight
She stood and listened to my lay
Amid the lingering light

Few sorrows hath she of her own
My hope my joy my Genevieve
She loves me best wheneer I sing
The songs that make her grieve

I played a soft and doleful air
I sang an old and moving story 
An old rude song that suited well
That ruin wild and hoary

She listened with a flitting blush
With downcast eyes and modest grace
For well she knew I could not choose
But gaze upon her face

I told her of the Knight that wore
Upon his shield a burning brand
And that for ten long years he wooed
The Lady of the Land

I told her how he pined and ah
The deep the low the pleading tone
With which I sang anothers love
Interpreted my own

She listened with a flitting blush
With downcast eyes and modest grace
And she forgave me that I gazed
Too fondly on her face

But when I told the cruel scorn
That crazed that bold and lovely Knight
And that he crossed the mountainwoods
Nor rested day nor night

That sometimes from the savage den
And sometimes from the darksome shade
And sometimes starting up at once
In green and sunny glade 

There came and looked him in the face
An angel beautiful and bright
And that he knew it was a Fiend
This miserable Knight

And that unknowing what he did
He leaped amid a murderous band
And saved from outrage worse than death
The Lady of the Land 

And how she wept and clasped his knees
And how she tended him in vain 
And ever strove to expiate
The scorn that crazed his brain 

And that she nursed him in a cave
And how his madness went away
When on the yellow forestleaves
A dying man he lay 

His dying words  but when I reached
That tenderest strain of all the ditty
My faltering voice and pausing harp
Disturbed her soul with pity

All impulses of soul and sense
Had thrilled my guileless Genevieve
The music and the doleful tale
The rich and balmy eve

And hopes and fears that kindle hope
An undistinguishable throng
And gentle wishes long subdued
Subdued and cherished long

She wept with pity and delight
She blushed with love and virginshame
And like the murmur of a dream
I heard her breathe my name

Her bosom heaved  she stepped aside
As conscious of my look she stepped 
Then suddenly with timorous eye
She fled to me and wept

She half enclosed me with her arms
She pressed me with a meek embrace
And bending back her head looked up
And gazed upon my face

Twas partly love and partly fear
And partly twas a bashful art
That I might rather feel than see
The swelling of her heart

I calmed her fears and she was calm
And told her love with virgin pride
And so I won my Genevieve
My bright and beauteous Bride

Samuel Taylor Coleridge 17721834


NESTED
On The Sussex Downs

Lured little one Nay youve but heard
Love oer your wild downs roaming
Not lured my bird my light swift bird
But homing  homing

Caught does she feel Nay no net stirred
To catch the heart forefated
Not caught my bird my bright wild bird
But mated  mated

And caged she fears Nay never that word
Of where your brown head rested
Not caged my bird my shy sweet bird
But nested  nested

Habberton Lulham 18 


THE LETTERS

Still on the tower stood the vane
A black yew gloomed the stagnant air
I peered athwart the chancel pane
And saw the altar cold and bare
A clog of lead was round my feet
A band of pain across my brow
Cold altar heaven and earth shall meet
Before you hear my marriage vow

I turned and hummed a bitter song
That mocked the wholesome human heart
And then we met in wrath and wrong
We met but only meant to part
Full cold my greeting was and dry
She faintly smiled she hardly moved
I saw with halfunconscious eye
She wore the colors I approved

She took the little ivory chest
With half a sigh she turned the key
Then raised her head with lips compressed
And gave my letters back to me
And gave the trinkets and the rings
My gifts when gifts of mine could please
As looks a father on the things
Of his dead son I looked on these

She told me all her friends had said
I raged against the public liar
She talked as if her love were dead
But in my words were seeds of fire
No more of love your sex is known
I never will be twice deceived
Henceforth I trust the man alone
The woman cannot be believed

Through slander meanest spawn of hell 
And womans slander is the worst 
And you whom once I loved so well
Through you my life will be accursed
I spoke with heart and heat and force
I shook her breast with vague alarms 
Like torrents from a mountain source
We rushed into each others arms

We parted sweetly gleamed the stars
And sweet the vaporbraided blue
Low breezes fanned the belfry bars
As homeward by the church I drew
The very graves appeared to smile
So fresh they rose in shadowed swells
Dark porch I said and silent aisle
There comes a sound of marriage bells

Alfred Tennyson 18091892


PROTHALAMION

Calm was the day and through the trembling air
Sweetbreathing Zephyrus did softly play
A gentle spirit that lightly did delay
Hot Titans beams which then did glister fair
When I whom sullen care
Through discontent of my long fruitless stay
In Princes Court and expectation vain
Of idle hopes which still do fly away
Like empty shadows did afflict my brain
Walked forth to ease my pain
Along the shore of silver streaming Thames
Whose rutty bank the which his river hems
Was painted all with variable flowers
And all the meads adorned with dainty gems
Fit to deck maidens bowers
And crown their paramours
Against the bridal day which is not long
Sweet Thames run softly till I end my song

There in a meadow by the rivers side
A flock of nymphs I chanced to espy
All lovely daughters of the flood thereby
With goodly greenish locks all loose untied
As each had been a bride
And each one had a little wicker basket
Made of fine twigs entrailed curiously
In which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket
And with fine fingers cropped full feateously
The tender stalks on high
Of every sort which in that meadow grew
They gathered some the violet pallid blue
The little daisy that at evening closes
The virgin lily and the primrose true
With store of vermeil roses
To deck their bridegrooms posies
Against the bridal day which was not long
Sweet Thames run softly till I end my song

With that I saw two swans of goodly hue
Come softly swimming down along the Lee
Two fairer birds I yet did never see
The snow which doth the top of Pindus strew
Did never whiter shew
Nor Jove himself when he a swan would be
For love of Leda whiter did appear
Yet Leda was they say as white as he
Yet not so white as these nor nothing near
So purely white they were
That even the gentle stream the which them bare
Seemed foul to them and bade his billows spare
To wet their silken feathers lest they might
Soil their fair plumes with water not so fair
And mar their beauties bright
That shone as heavens light
Against their bridal day which was not long
Sweet Thames run softly till I end my song

Eftsoons the nymphs which now had flowers their fill
Ran all in haste to see that silver brood
As they came floating on the crystal flood
Whom when they saw they stood amazed still
Their wondering eyes to fill
Them seemed they never saw a sight so fair
Of fowls so lovely that they sure did deem
Them heavenly born or to be that same pair
Which through the sky draw Venus silver team
For sure they did not seem
To be begot of any earthly seed
But rather angels or of angels breed
Yet were they bred of summers heat they say
In sweetest season when each flower and weed
The earth did fresh array
So fresh they seemed as day
Even as their bridal day which was not long
Sweet Thames run softly till I end my song

Then forth they all out of their baskets drew
Great store of flowers the honor of the field
That to the sense did fragrant odors yield
All which upon those goodly birds they threw
And all the waves did strew
That like old Peneus waters they did seem
When down along by pleasant Tempes shore
Scattered with flowers through Thessaly they stream
That they appear through lilies plenteous store
Like a brides chamber floor
Two of those nymphs meanwhile two garlands bound
Of freshest flowers which in that mead they found
The which presenting all in trim array
Their snowy foreheads therewithal they crowned
Whilst one did sing this lay
Prepared against that day
Against their bridal day which was not long
Sweet Thames run softly till I end my song

Ye gentle birds the worlds fair ornament
And heavens glory whom this happy hour
Doth lead unto your lovers blissful bower
Joy may you have and gentle hearts content
Of your loves couplement
And let fair Venus that is queen of love
With her heartquelling son upon you smile
Whose smile they say hath virtue to remove
All loves dislike and friendships faulty guile
For ever to assoil
Let endless peace your steadfast hearts accord
And blessed plenty wait upon your board
And let your bed with pleasures chaste abound
That fruitful issue may to you afford
Which may your foes confound
And make your joys redound
Upon your bridal day which is not long
Sweet Thames run softly till I end my song

So ended she and all the rest around
To her redoubled that her undersong
Which said their bridal day should not be long
And gentle Echo from the neighborground
Their accents did resound
So forth those joyous birds did pass along
Adown the Lee that to them murmured low
As he would speak but that he lacked a tongue
Yet did by signs his glad affection show
Making his stream run slow
And all the fowl which in his flood did dwell
Gan flock about these twain that did excel
The rest so far as Cynthia doth shend
The lesser stars So they enranged well
Did on those two attend
And their best service lend
Against their wedding day which was not long
Sweet Thames run softly till I end my song

At length they all to merry London came
To merry London my most kindly nurse
That to me gave this lifes first native source
Though from another place I take my name
An house of ancient fame
There when they came whereas those bricky towers
The which on Thames broad aged back do ride
Where now the studious lawyers have their bowers
There whilom wont the Templar Knights to bide
Till they decayed through pride
Next whereunto there stands a stately place
Where oft I gained gifts and goodly grace
Of that great lord which therein wont to dwell
Whose want too well now feels my friendless case
But ah here fits not well
Old woes but joys to tell
Against the bridal day which is not long
Sweet Thames run softly till I end my song

Yet therein now doth lodge a noble peer
Great Englands glory and the worlds wide wonder
Whose dreadful name late through all Spain did thunder
And Hercules two pillars standing near
Did make to quake and fear
Fair branch of honor flower of chivalry
That fillest England with thy triumphs fame
Joy have thou of thy noble victory
And endless happiness of thine own name
That promiseth the same
That through thy prowess and victorious arms
Thy country may be freed from foreign harms
And great Elisas glorious name may ring
Through all the world filled with thy wide alarms
Which some brave muse may sing
To ages following
Upon the bridal day which is not long
Sweet Thames run softly till I end my song

From those high towers this noble lord issuing
Like radiant Hesper when his golden hair
In the ocean billows he hath bathed fair
Descended to the rivers open viewing
With a great train ensuing
Above the rest were goodly to be seen
Two gentle knights of lovely face and feature
Beseeming well the bower of any queen
With gifts of wit and ornaments of nature
Fit for so goodly stature
That like the twins of Jove they seemed in sight
Which deck the baldrick of the heavens bright
They two forth pacing to the rivers side
Received those two fair brides their loves delight
Which at the appointed tide
Each one did make his bride
Against their bridal day which is not long
Sweet Thames run softly till I end my song

Edmund Spenser 15521599


EPITHALAMION

Ye learned sisters which have oftentimes
Been to me aiding others to adorn
Whom ye thought worthy of your graceful rhymes
That even the greatest did not greatly scorn
To hear their names sung in your simple lays
But joyed in their praise
And when ye list your own mishaps to mourn
Which death or love or fortunes wreck did raise
Your string could soon to sadder tenor turn
And teach the woods and waters to lament
Your doleful dreariment
Now lay those sorrowful complaints aside
And having all your heads with garlands crowned
Help me mine own loves praises to resound
Nor let the same of any be envide
So Orpheus did for his own bride
So I unto myself alone will sing
The woods shall to me answer and my echo ring

Early before the worlds lightgiving lamp
His golden beam upon the hills doth spread
Having dispersed the nights uncheerful damp
Do ye awake and with fresh lustyhed
Go to the bower of my beloved love
My truest turtle dove
Bid her awake for Hymen is awake
And long since ready forth his mask to move
With his bright Tead that flames with many a flake
And many a bachelor to wait on him
In their fresh garments trim
Bid her awake therefore and soon her dight
For lo the wished day is come at last
That shall for all the pains and sorrows past
Pay to her usury of long delight
And whilst she doth her dight
Do ye to her of joy and solace sing
That all the woods may answer and your echo ring

Bring with you all the Nymphs that you can hear
Both of the rivers and the forests green
And of the sea that neighbors to her near
All with gay garlands goodly well beseen
And let them also with them bring in hand
Another gay garland
For my fair love of lilies and of roses
Bound truelove wise with a blue silk riband
And let them make great store of bridal posies
And let them eke bring store of other flowers
To deck the bridal bowers
And let the ground whereas her foot shall tread
For fear the stones her tender foot should wrong
Be strewed with fragrant flowers all along
And diapered like the discolored mead
Which done do at her chamber door await
For she will waken straight
The whiles do ye this song unto her sing
The woods shall to you answer and your echo ring

Ye Nymphs of Mulla which with careful heed
The silver scaly trouts do tend full well
And greedy pikes which use therein to feed
Those trouts and pikes all others do excel
And ye likewise which keep the rushy lake
Where none do fishes take
Bind up the locks the which hang scattered light
And in his waters which your mirror make
Behold your faces as the crystal bright
That when you come whereas my love doth lie
No blemish she may spy
And eke ye lightfoot maids which keep the deer
That on the hoary mountain used to tower
And the wild wolves which seek them to devour
With your steel darts do chase from coming near
Be also present here
To help to deck her and to help to sing
That all the woods may answer and your echo ring

Wake now my love awake for it is time
The rosy mom long since left Tithons bed
All ready to her silver coach to climb
And Phoebus gins to show his glorious head
Hark how the cheerful birds do chant their lays
And carol of loves praise
The merry lark her matins sings aloft
The thrush replies the mavis descant plays
The ouzel shrills the ruddock warbles soft
So goodly all agree with sweet consent
To this days merriment
Ah my dear love why do ye sleep thus long
When meeter were that ye should now awake
To await the coming of your joyous mate
And hearken to the birds lovelearned song
The dewy leaves among
For they of joy and pleasance to you sing
That all the woods them answer and their echo ring

My love is now awake out of her dreams
And her fair eyes like stars that dimmed were
With darksome cloud now show their goodly beams
More bright than Hesperus his head doth rear
Come now ye damsels daughters of delight
Help quickly her to dight
But first come ye fair hours which were begot
In Joves sweet paradise of Day and Night
Which do the seasons of the year allot
And all that ever in this world is fair
Do make and still repair
And ye three handmaids of the Cyprian queen
The which do still adorn her beautys pride
Help to adorn my beautifulest bride
And as ye her array still throw between
Some graces to be seen
And as ye use to Venus to her sing
The whiles the woods shall answer and your echo ring

Now is my love all ready forth to come
Let all the virgins therefore well await
And ye fresh boys that tend upon her groom
Prepare yourselves for he is coming straight
Set all your things in seemly good array
Fit for so joyful day
The joyfulest day that ever sun did see
Fair Sun show forth thy favorable ray
And let thy lifefull heat not fervent be
For fear of burning her sunshiny face
Her beauty to disgrace
O fairest Phoebus father of the Muse
If ever I did honor thee aright
Or sing the thing that might thy mind delight
Do not thy servants simple boon refuse
But let this day let this one day be mine
Let all the rest be thine
Then I thy sovereign praises loud will sing
That all the woods shall answer and their echo ring

Hark how the Minstrels gin to shrill aloud
Their merry music that resounds from far
The pipe the tabor and the trembling croud
That well agree withouten breach or jar
But most of all the Damsels do delight
When they their timbrels smite
And thereunto do dance and carol sweet
That all the senses they do ravish quite
The whiles the boys run up and down the street
Crying aloud with strong confused noise
As if it were one voice
Hymen io Hymen Hymen they do shout
That even to the heavens their shouting shrill
Doth reach and all the firmament doth fill
To which the people standing all about
As in approvance do thereto applaud
And loud advance her laud
And evermore they Hymen Hymen sing
That all the woods them answer and their echo ring

Lo where she comes along with portly pace
Like Phoebe from her chamber of the East
Arising forth to run her mighty race
Clad all in white that seems a virgin best
So well it her beseems that ye would ween
Some angel she had been
Her long loose yellow locks like golden wire
Sprinkled with pearl and pearling flowers atween
Do like a golden mantle her attire
And being crowned with a garland green
Seem like some maiden queen
Her modest eyes abashed to behold
So many gazers as on her do stare
Upon the lowly ground affixed are
Nor dare lift up her countenance too bold
But blush to hear her praises sung so loud
So far from being proud
Nathless do ye still loud her praises sing
That all the woods may answer and your echo ring

Tell me ye merchants daughters did ye see
So fair a creature in your town before
So sweet so lovely and so mild as she
Adorned with beautys grace and virtues store
Her goodly eyes like sapphires shining bright
Her forehead ivory white
Her cheeks like apples which the sun hath ruddied
Her lips like cherries charming men to bite
Her breast like to a bowl of cream uncrudded
Her paps like lilies budded
Her snowy neck like to a marble tower
And all her body like a palace fair
Ascending up with many a stately stair
To honors seat and chastitys sweet bower
Why stand ye still ye virgins in amaze
Upon her so to gaze
Whiles ye forget your former lay to sing
To which the woods did answer and your echo ring

But if ye saw that which no eyes can see
The inward beauty of her lively spright
Garnished with heavenly gifts of high degree
Much more then would ye wonder at that sight
And stand astonished like to those which read
Medusas mazeful head
There dwells sweet love and constant chastity
Unspotted faith and comely womanhood
Regard of honor and mild modesty
There virtue reigns as queen in royal throne
And giveth laws alone
The which the base affections do obey
And yield their services unto her will
Nor thought of thing uncomely ever may
Thereto approach to tempt her mind to ill
Had ye once seen these her celestial treasures
And unrevealed pleasures
Then would ye wonder and her praises sing
That all the woods should answer and your echo ring

Open the temple gates unto my love
Open them wide that she may enter in
And all the posts adorn as doth behove
And all the pillars deck with garlands trim
For to receive this Saint with honor due
That cometh in to you
With trembling steps and humble reverence
She cometh in before the Almightys view
Of her ye virgins learn obedience
When so ye come into those holy places
To humble your proud faces
Bring her up to the high altar that she may
The sacred ceremonies there partake
The which do endless matrimony make
And let the roaring organs loudly play
The praises of the Lord in lively notes
The whiles with hollow throats
The Choristers the joyous Anthems sing
That all the woods may answer and their echo ring

Behold whiles she before the altar stands
Hearing the holy priest that to her speaks
And blesseth her with his two happy hands
How the red roses flush up in her cheeks
And the pure snow with goodly vermill stain
Like crimson dyed in grain
That even the Angels which continually
About the sacred altar do remain
Forget their service and about her fly
Oft peeping in her face that seems more fair
The more they on it stare
But her sad eyes still fastened on the ground
Are governed with goodly modesty
That suffers not one look to glance awry
Which may let in a little thought unsound
Why blush ye love to give to me your hand
The pledge of all our band
Sing ye sweet Angels Alleluja sing
That all the woods may answer and your echo ring

Now all is done bring home the bride again
Bring home the triumph of our victory
Bring home with you the glory of her gain
With joyance bring her and with jollity
Never had man more joyful day than this
Whom heaven would heap with bliss
Make feast therefore now all this livelong day
This day for ever to me holy is
Pour out the wine without restraint or stay
Pour not by cups but by the belly full
Pour out to all that will
And sprinkle all the posts and walls with wine
That they may sweat and drunken be withal
Crown ye God Bacchus with a coronal
And Hymen also crown with wreaths of vine
And let the Graces dance unto the rest
For they can do it best
The whiles the maidens do their carol sing
To which the woods shall answer and their echo ring

Ring ye the bells ye young men of the town
And leave your wonted labors for this day
This day is holy do ye write it down
That ye for ever it remember may
This day the sun is in his chiefest height
With Barnaby the bright
From whence declining daily by degrees
He somewhat loseth of his heat and light
When once the Crab behind his back he sees
But for this time it ill ordained was
To choose the longest day in all the year
And shortest night when longest fitter were
Yet never day so long but late would pass
Ring ye the bells to make it wear away
And bonfires make all day
And dance about them and about them sing
That all the woods may answer and your echo ring

Ah when will this long weary day have end
And lend me leave to come unto my love
How slowly do the hours their numbers spend
How slowly does sad Time his feathers move
Haste thee O fairest Planet to thy home
Within the Western foam
Thy tired steeds long since have need of rest
Long though it be at last I see it gloom
And the bright eveningstar with golden crest
Appear out of the East
Fair child of beauty glorious lamp of love
That all the host of heaven in ranks dost lead
And guidest lovers through the nights sad dread
How cheerfully thou lookest from above
And seems to laugh atween thy twinkling light
As joying in the sight
Of these glad many which for joy do sing
That all the woods them answer and their echo ring

Now cease ye damsels your delights forepast
Enough is it that all the day was yours
Now day is done and night is nighing fast
Now bring the bride into the bridal bowers
The night is come now soon her disarray
And in her bed her lay
Lay her in lilies and in violets
And silken curtains over her display
And odored sheets and Arras coverlets
Behold how goodly my fair love does lie
In proud humility
Like unto Maia when as Jove her took
In Tempe lying on the flowery grass
Twixt sleep and wake after she weary was
With bathing in the Acidalian brook
Now it is night ye damsels may be gone
And leave my love alone
And leave likewise your former lay to sing
The woods no more shall answer nor your echo ring

Now welcome night thou night so long expected
That long days labor dost at last defray
And all my cares which cruel Love collected
Hast summed in one and cancelled for aye
Spread thy broad wing over my love and me
That no man may us see
And in thy sable mantle us enwrap
From fear of peril and foul horror free
Let no false treason seek us to entrap
Nor any dread disquiet once annoy
The safety of our joy
But let the night be calm and quietsome
Without tempestuous storms or sad affray
Like as when Jove with fair Alcmena lay
When he begot the great Tirynthian groom
Or like as when he with thyself did lie
And begot Majesty
And let the maids and young men cease to sing
Nor let the woods them answer nor their echo ring

Let no lamenting cries nor doleful tears
Be heard all night within nor yet without
Nor let false whispers breeding hidden fears
Break gentle sleep with misconceived doubt
Let no deluding dreams nor dreadful sights
Make sudden sad affrights
Nor let housefires nor lightnings helpless harms
Nor let the Puck nor other evil sprites
Nor let mischievous witches with their charms
Nor let hobgoblins names whose sense we see not
Fray us with things that be not
Let not the screechowl nor the stork be heard
Nor the night raven that still deadly yells
Nor damned ghosts called up with mighty spells
Nor grizzly vultures make us once afraid
Nor let the unpleasant choir of frogs still croaking
Make us to wish their choking
Let none of these their dreary accents sing
Nor let the woods them answer nor their echo ring

But let still Silence true nightwatches keep
That sacred Peace may in assurance reign
And timely Sleep when it is time to sleep
May pour his limbs forth on your pleasant plain
The whiles an hundred little winged loves
Like diversfeathered doves
Shall fly and flutter round about your bed
And in the secret dark that none reproves
Their pretty stealths shall work and snares shall spread
To filch away sweet snatches of delight
Concealed through covert night
Ye sons of Venus play your sports at will
For greedy pleasure careless of your toys
Thinks more upon her paradise of joys
Then what ye do albeit good or ill
All night therefore attend your merry play
For it will soon be day
Now none doth hinder you that say or sing
Nor will the woods now answer nor your echo ring

Who is the same which at my window peeps
Or whose is that fair face that shines so bright
Is it not Cynthia she that never sleeps
But walks about high heaven all the night
O fairest goddess do thou not envy
My love with me to spy
For thou likewise didst love though now unthought
And for a fleece of wool which privily
The Latmian shepherd once unto thee brought
His pleasures with thee wrought
Therefore to us be favorable now
And since of womens labors thou hast charge
And generation goodly dost enlarge
Incline thy will to effect our wishful vow
And the chaste womb inform with timely seed
That may our comfort breed
Till which we cease our hopeful hap to sing
Nor let the woods us answer nor our echo ring

And thou great Juno which with awful might
The laws of wedlock still dost patronize
And the religion of the faith first plight
With sacred rites hast taught to solemnize
And eke for comfort often called art
Of women in their smart
Eternally bind thou this lovely band
And all thy blessings unto us impart
And thou glad Genius in whose gentle hand
The bridal bower and genial bed remain
Without blemish or stain
And the sweet pleasures of their loves delight
With secret aid dost succor and supply
Till they bring forth the fruitful progeny
Send us the timely fruit of this same night
And thou fair Hebe and thou Hymen free
Grant that it may so be
Till which we cease your further praise to sing
Nor any woods shall answer nor your echo ring

And ye high heavens the temple of the gods
In which a thousand torches flaming bright
Do burn that to us wretched earthly clods
In dreadful darkness lend desired light
And all ye powers which in the same remain
More than we men can feign
Pour out your blessing on us plenteously
And happy influence upon us rain
Thatwe may raise a large posterity
Which from the earth which they may long possess
With lasting happiness
Up to your haughty palaces may mount
And for the guerdon of their glorious merit
May heavenly tabernacles there inherit
Of blessed Saints for to increase the count
So let us rest sweet love in hope of this
And cease till then our timely joys to sing
The woods no more us answer nor our echo ring

Song made in lieu of many ornaments
With which my love should duly have been decked
Which cutting off through hasty accidents
Ye would not stay your due time to expect
But promised both to recompense
Be unto her a goodly ornament
And for short time an endless monument

Edmund Spenser 15521599


THE KISS

Before you kissed me only winds of heaven
Had kissed me and the tenderness of rain 
Now you have come how can I care for kisses
Like theirs again

I sought the sea she sent her winds to meet me
They surged about me singing of the south 
I turned my head away to keep still holy
Your kiss upon my mouth

And swift sweet rains of shining April weather
Found not my lips where living kisses are
I bowed my head lest they put out my glory
As rain puts out a star

I am my loves and he is mine forever
Sealed with a seal and safe forevermore 
Think you that I could let a beggar enter
Where a king stood before

Sara Teasdale 18841933


MARRIAGE

Going my way of old
Contented more or less
I dreamt not life could hold
Such happiness

I dreamt not that loves way
Could keep the golden height
Day after happy day
Night after night

Wilfrid Wilson Gibson 1878


THE NEWLYWEDDED

Now the rite is duly done
Now the word is spoken
And the spell has made us one
Which may neer be broken
Rest we dearest in our home
Roam we oer the heather
We shall rest and we shall roam
Shall we not together

From this hour the summer rose
Sweeter breathes to charm us
From this hour the winter snows
Lighter fall to harm us
Fair or foul  on land or sea 
Come the wind or weather
Best and worst whateer they be
We shall share together

Death who friend from friend can part
Brother rend from brother
Shall but link us heart and heart
Closer to each other
We will call his anger play
Deem his dart a feather
When we meet him on our way
Hand in hand together

Winthrop Mackworth Praed 18021839


I SAW TWO CLOUDS AT MORNING

I saw two clouds at morning
Tinged by the rising sun
And in the dawn they floated on
And mingled into one
I thought that morning cloud was blest
It moved so sweetly to the west

I saw two summer currents
Flow smoothly to their meeting
And join their course with silent force
In peace each other greeting
Calm was their course through banks of green
While dimpling eddies played between

Such be your gentle motion
Till lifes last pulse shall beat
Like summers beam and summers stream
Float on in joy to meet
A calmer sea where storms shall cease
A purer sky where all is peace

John Gardiner Calkins Brainard 17961828


HOLY MATRIMONY

The voice that breathed oer Eden
That earliest weddingday
The primal marriage blessing
It hath not passed away

Still in the pure espousal
Of Christian man and maid
The holy Three are with us
The threefold grace is said

For dower of blessed children
For love and faiths sweet sake
For high mysterious union
Which naught on earth may break

Be present awful Father
To give away this bride
As Eve thou gavst to Adam
Out of his own pierced side

Be present Son of Mary
To join their loving hands
As thou didst bind two natures
In thine eternal bands

Be present Holiest Spirit
To bless them as they kneel
As thou for Christ the Bridegroom
The heavenly Spouse dost seal

Oh spread thy pure wing oer them
Let no ill power find place
When onward to thine altar
The hallowed path they trace

To cast their crowns before thee
In perfect sacrifice
Till to the home of gladness
With Christs own Bride they rise Amen

John Keble 17921866


THE BRIDE

Beat on the Tomtoms and scatter the flowers
Jasmine hibiscus vermilion and white
This is the day and the Hour of Hours
Bring forth the Bride for her Lovers delight
Maidens no more as a maiden shall claim her
Near in his Mystery draweth Desire
Who if she waver a moment shall blame her
She is a flower and love is a fire

Give her the anklets the ring and the necklace
Darken her eyelids with delicate art
Heighten the beauty so youthful and fleckless
By the Gods favored oh Bridegroom thou art
Twine in thy fingers her fingers so slender
Circle together the Mystical Fire
Bridegroom  a whisper  be gentle and tender
Choti Tinchaurya knows not desire

Bring forth the silks and the veil that shall cover
Beauty till yesterday careless and wild
Red are her lips for the kiss of a lover
Ripe are her breasts for the lips of a child
Center and Shrine of Mysterious Power
Chalice of Pleasure and Rose of Delight
Shyly aware of the swiftcoming hour
Waiting the shade and the silence of night

Still must the Bridegroom his longing dissemble
Longing to loosen the silkwoven cord
Ah how his fingers will flutter and tremble
Fingers well skilled with the bridle and sword
Thine is his valor oh Bride and his beauty
Thine to possess and reissue again
Such is thy tender and passionate duty
Licit thy pleasure and honored thy pain

Choti Tinchaurya lovely and tender
Still all unbroken to sorrow and strife
Come to the Bridegroom who silkclad and slender
Brings thee the Honor and Burden of Life
Bidding farewell to thy lighthearted playtime
Worship thy Lover with fear and delight
Art thou not ever though slave of his daytime
Choti Tinchaurya queen of his night

Laurence Hope 18651904


A MARRIAGE CHARM

I set a charm upon your hurrying breath
I set a charm upon your wandering feet
You shall not leave me  not for life nor death
Not even though you cease to love me Sweet

A womans love nine Angels cannot bind
Nor any rune that wind or water knows
My heart were all as well set on the wind
Or bound to live or die upon a rose

I set a charm upon you foot and hand
That you and Knowledge love may never meet
That you may never chance to understand
How strong you are how weak your lover Sweet

I set my charm upon your kindly arm
I set it as a seal upon your breast
That you may never hear anothers charm
Nor guess anothers gift outruns my best

I bid your wandering footsteps me to follow
Your thoughts to travel after in my track
I am the sky that waits you dear gray swallow
No wind of mine shall ever blow you back

I am your dream Sweet so no more of dreaming
Your lips to mine must end this chanted charm
Your heart to mine neath nutbrown tresses streaming
I set my love a seal upon your arm

Nora Hopper 18711906


LIKE A LAVEROCK IN THE LIFT

Its we two its we two its we two for aye
All the world and we two and Heaven be our stay
Like a laverock in the lift sing O bonny bride
All the world was Adam once with Eve by his side

Whats the world my lass my love  what can it do
I am thine and thou art mine life is sweet and new
If the world have missed the mark let it stand by
For we two have gotten leave and once more well try

Like a laverock in the lift sing O bonny bride
Its we two its we two happy side by side
Take a kiss from me thy man now the song begins
All is made afresh for us and the brave heart wins

When the darker days come and no sun will shine
Thou shalt dry my tears lass and Ill dry thine
Its we two its we two while the worlds away
Sitting by the golden sheaves on our weddingday

Jean Ingelow 18201897


MY OWEN

Proud of you fond of you clinging so near to you
Light is my heart now I know I am dear to you
Glad is my voice now so free it may sing for you
All the wild love that is burning within for you
Tell me once more tell it over and over
The tale of that eve which first saw you my lover
Now I need never blush
At my hearts hottest gush 
The wife of my Owen her heart may discover

Proud of you fond of you having all right in you
Quitting all else through my love and delight in you
Glad is my heart since tis beating so nigh to you
Light is my step for it always may fly to you
Clasped in your arms where no sorrow can reach to me
Reading your eyes till new love they shall teach to me
Though wild and weak till now
By that blest marriage vow
More than the wisest know your heart shall preach to me

Ellen Mary Patrick Downing 18281869


DORIS A PASTORAL

I sat with Doris the shepherd maiden
Her crook was laden with wreathed flowers
I sat and wooed her through sunlight wheeling
And shadows stealing for hours and hours

And she my Doris whose lap incloses
Wild summer roses of faint perfume
The while I sued her kept hushed and harkened
Till shades had darkened from gloss to gloom

She touched my shoulder with fearful finger
She said We linger we must not stay
My flocks in danger my sheep will wander
Behold them yonder how far they stray

I answered bolder Nay let me hear you
And still be near you and still adore
No wolf nor stranger will touch one yearling 
Ah stay my darling a moment more

She whispered sighing There will be sorrow
Beyond tomorrow if I lose today
My fold unguarded my flock unfolded 
I shall be scolded and sent away

Said I denying If they do miss you
They ought to kiss you when you get home
And well rewarded by friend and neighbor
Should be the labor from which you come

They might remember she answered meekly
That lambs are weakly and sheep are wild
But if they love me its none so fervent 
I am a servant and not a child

Then each hot ember glowed quick within me
And love did win me to swift reply
Ah do but prove me and none shall bind you
Nor fray nor find you until I die

She blushed and started and stood awaiting
As if debating in dreams divine
But I did brave them  I told her plainly
She doubted vainly she must be mine

So we twinhearted from all the valley
Did rouse and rally her nibbling ewes
And homeward drove them we two together
Through blooming heather and gleaming dews

That simple duty such grace did lend her
My Doris tender my Doris true
That I her warder did always bless her
And often press her to take her due

And now in beauty she fills my dwelling
With love excelling and undefiled
And love doth guard her both fast and fervent
No more a servant nor yet a child

Arthur Joseph Munby 18281910


HED NOTHING BUT HIS VIOLIN

Hed nothing but his violin
Id nothing but my song
But we were wed when skies were blue
And summer days were long
And when we rested by the hedge
The robins came and told
How they had dared to woo and win
When early Spring was cold

We sometimes supped on dewberries
Or slept among the hay
But oft the farmers wives at eve
Came out to hear us play
The rare old songs the dear old tunes 
We could not starve for long
While my man had his violin
And I my sweet lovesong

The world has aye gone well with us
Old man since we were one 
Our homeless wandering down the lanes
It long ago was done
But those who wait for gold or gear
For houses or for kine
Till youths sweet spring grows brown and sere
And love and beauty tine
Will never know the joy of hearts
That met without a fear
When you had but your violin
And I a song my dear

Mary Kyle Dallas 18301897


LOVES CALENDAR

That gusty spring each afternoon
By the ivied cot I passed
And noted at that lattice soon
Her fair face downward cast
Still in the same place seated there
So diligent so very fair

Ofttimes I said I knew her not
Yet that way round would go
Until when evenings lengthened out
And bloomed the mayhedge row
I met her by the wayside well
Whose waters maybe broke the spell

For leaning on her pail she prayed
Id lift it to her head
So did I but Im much afraid
Some wasteful drops were shed
And that we blushed as face to face
Needs must we stand the shortest space

Then when the sunset mellowed through
The ears of rustling grain
When lattices wide open flew
When ashleaves fell like rain
As well as I she knew the hour
At morn or eve I neared her bower

And now that snow oerlays the thatch
Each starlit eve within
The door she waits I raise the latch
And kiss her lifted chin
Nor do I think weve blushed again
For Love hath made but one of twain

William Bell Scott 18111890


HOME

Two birds within one nest
Two hearts within one breast
Two spirits in one fair
Firm league of love and prayer
Together bound for aye together blest

An ear that waits to catch
A hand upon the latch
A step that hastens its sweet rest to win
A world of care without
A world of strife shut out
A world of love shut in

Dora Greenwell 18211882


TWO LOVERS

Two lovers by a mossgrown spring
They leaned soft cheeks together there
Mingled the dark and sunny hair
And heard the wooing thrashes sing
O budding time
O loves blest prime

Two wedded from the portal stept
The bells made happy carolings
The air was soft as fanning wings
White petals on the pathway slept
O pureeyed bride
O tender pride

Two faces oer a cradle bent
Two hands above the head were locked
These pressed each other while they rocked
Those watched a life that love had sent
O solemn hour
O hidden power

Two parents by the evening fire
The red light fell about their knees
On heads that rose by slow degrees
Like buds upon the lily spire
O patient life
O tender strife

The two still sat together there
The red light shone about their knees
But all the heads by slow degrees
Had gone and left that lonely pair
O voyage fast
O vanished past

The red light shone upon the floor
And made the space between them wide
They drew their chairs up side by side
Their pale cheeks joined and said Once more
O memories
O past that is

George Eliot 18191880


THE LAND OF HEARTS DESIRE

Somewhere he mused its dear enchantments wait
That land so heavenly sweet
Yet all the paths we follow soon or late
End in the deserts heat

And still it lures us to the eager quest
And calls us day by day 
But I she said her babe upon her breast
But I have found the way

Some time he sighed when youth and joy are spent
Our feet the gates may win 
But I she smiled with eyes of deep content
But I have entered in

Emily Huntington Miller 18331913


MY AIN WIFE

I wadna gie my ain wife
For ony wife I see
I wadna gie my ain wife
For ony wife I see
A bonnier yet Ive never seen
A better canna be 
I wadna gie my ain wife

O couthie is my inglecheek

Nor hear her word on ane
Shes gude wi a the neebors roun
An aye gude wi me 
I wadna gie my ain wife
For ony wife I see

An O her looks sae kindlie
They melt my heart outright
When oer the baby at her breast
She hangs wi fond delight
She looks intill its bonnie face
An syne looks to me 
I wadna gie my ain wife
For ony wife I see

Alexander Laing 17871857


THE IRISH WIFE

I would not give my Irish wife
For all the dames of the Saxon land
I would not give my Irish wife
For the Queen of Frances hand
For she to me is dearer
Than castles strong or lands or life
An outlaw  so Im near her
To love till death my Irish wife

O what would be this home of mine
A ruined hermithaunted place
But for the light that nightly shines
Upon its walls from Kathleens face
What comfort in a mine of gold
What pleasure in a royal life
If the heart within lay dead and cold
If I could not wed my Irish wife

I knew the law forbade the banns
I knew my king abhorred her race
Who never bent before their clans
Must bow before their ladies grace
Take all my forfeited domain
I cannot wage with kinsmen strife
Take knightly gear and noble name
And I will keep my Irish wife

My Irish wife has clear blue eyes
My heaven by day my stars by night
And twinlike truth and fondness lies
Within her swelling bosom white
My Irish wife has golden hair
Apollos harp had once such strings
Apollos self might pause to hear
Her birdlike carol when she sings

I would not give my Irish wife
For all the dames of the Saxon land
I would not give my Irish wife
For the Queen of Frances hand
For she to me is dearer
Than castles strong or lands or life
In death I would be near her
And rise beside my Irish wife

Thomas DArcy McGee 18251868

The warlds wrack we share ot
The warsle and the care ot

And think my lot divine

Robert Burns 17591796


LETTICE

I said to Lettice our sister Lettice
While drooped and glistened her eyelash brown
Your mans a poor man a cold and dour man
Theres many a better about our town
She smiled securely  He loves me purely
A true hearts safe both in smile or frown
And nothing harms me while his love warms me
Whether the world go up or down

He comes of strangers and they are rangers
And ill to trust girl when out of sight
Fremd folk may blame ye and een defame ye
A gown oft handled looks seldom white
She raised serenely her eyelids queenly 
My innocence is my whitest gown
No harsh tongue grieves me while he believes me
Whether the world go up or down

Your mans a frail man was neer a hale man
And sickness knocketh at every door
And death comes making bold hearts cower breaking 
Our Lettice trembled  but once no more
If death should enter smite to the center
Our poor home palace all crumbling down
He cannot fright us nor disunite us
Life bears Loves cross death brings Loves crown

Dinah Maria Mulock Craik 18261887


IF THOU WERT BY MY SIDE MY LOVE

If thou wert by my side my love
How fast would evening fail
In green Bengalas palmy grove
Listening the nightingale

If thou my love wert by my side
My babies at my knee
How gayly would our pinnace glide
Oer Gungas mimic sea

I miss thee at the dawning gray
When on our deck reclined
In careless ease my limbs I lay
And woo the cooler wind

I miss thee when by Gungas stream
My twilight steps I guide
But most beneath the lamps pale beam
I miss thee from my side

I spread my books my pencil try
The lingering noon to cheer
But miss thy kind approving eye
Thy meek attentive ear

But when at morn and eve the star
Beholds me on my knee
I feel though thou art distant far
Thy prayers ascend for me

Then on then on where duty leads
My course be onward still
Oer broad Hindostans sultry meads
Oer bleak Almorahs hill

That course nor Delhis kingly gates
Nor mild Malwah detain
For sweet the bliss us both awaits
By yonder western main

Thy towers Bombay gleam bright they say
Across the dark blue sea
But neer were hearts so light and gay
As then shall meet in thee

Reginald Heber 17831826


THE SHEPHERDS WIFES SONG
From The Mourning Garment

Ah what is love It is a pretty thing
As sweet unto a shepherd as a king
And sweeter too
For kings have cares that wait upon a crown
And cares can make the sweetest love to frown
Ah then ah then
If country loves such sweet desires do gain
What lady would not love a shepherd swain

His flocks are folded he comes home at night
As merry as a king in his delight
And merrier too
For kings bethink them what the state require
Where shepherds careless carol by the fire

He kisseth first then sits as blithe to eat
His cream and curds as doth a king his meat
And blither too
For kings have often fears when they do sup
Where shepherds dread no poison in their cup

To bed he goes as wanton then I ween
As is a king in dalliance with a queen
More wanton too
For kings have many griefs affects to move
Where shepherds have no greater grief than love

Upon his couch of straw he sleeps as sound
As doth the king upon his bed of down
More sounder too
For cares cause kings full oft their sleep to spill
Where weary shepherds lie and snort their fill

Thus with his wife he spends the year as blithe
As doth the king at every tide or sithe
And blither too
For kings have wars and broils to take in hand
Where shepherds laugh and love upon the land
Ah then ah then
Since country loves such sweet desires do gain
What lady would not love a shepherd swain

Robert Greene 15601592


TRUTH DOTH TRUTH DESERVE
From the Arcadia

Who doth desire that chaste his wife should be
First be he true for truth doth truth deserve
Then such be he as she his worth may see
And one man still credit with her preserve
Not toying kind nor causelessly unkind
Not stirring thoughts nor yet denying right
Not spying faults nor in plain errors blind
Never hard hand nor ever reins too light
As far from want as far from vain expense
The one doth force the latter doth entice
Allow good company but keep from thence
All filthy mouths that glory in their vice
This done thou hast no more but leave the rest
To virtue fortune time and womans breast

Philip Sidney 15541586


THE MARRIED LOVER
From The Angel in the House

Why having won her do I woo
Because her spirits vestal grace
Provokes me always to pursue
But spiritlike eludes embrace
Because her womanhood is such
That as on courtdays subjects kiss
The Queens hand yet so near a touch
Affirms no mean familiarness
Nay rather marks more fair the height
Which can with safety so neglect
To dread as lower ladies might
That grace could meet with disrespect
Thus she with happy favor feeds
Allegiance from a love so high
That thence no false conceit proceeds
Of difference bridged or state put by
Because although in act and word
As lowly as a wife can be
Her manners when they call me lord
Remind me tis by courtesy
Not with her least consent of will
Which would my proud affection hurt
But by the noble style that still
Imputes an unattained desert
Because her gay and lofty brows
When all is won which hope can ask
Reflect a light of hopeless snows
That bright in virgin ether bask
Because though free of the outer court
I am this Temple keeps its shrine
Sacred to heaven because in short
Shes not and never can be mine

Coventry Patmore 18231896


MY LOVE

Not as all other women are
Is she that to my soul is dear
Her glorious fancies come from far
Beneath the silver eveningstar
And yet her heart is ever near

Great feelings hath she of her own
Which lesser souls may never know
God giveth them to her alone
And sweet they are as any tone
Wherewith the wind may choose to blow

Yet in herself she dwelleth not
Although no home were half so fair
No simplest duty is forgot
Life hath no dim and lowly spot
That doth not in her sunshine share

She doeth little kindnesses
Which most leave undone or despise
For naught that sets one heart at ease
And giveth happiness or peace
Is lowesteemed in her eyes

She hath no scorn of common things
And though she seem of other birth
Round us her heart intwines and clings
And patiently she folds her wings
To tread the humble paths of earth

Blessing she is God made her so
And deeds of weekday holiness
Fall from her noiseless as the snow
Nor hath she ever chanced to know
That aught were easier than to bless

She is most fair and thereunto
Her life doth rightly harmonize
Feeling or thought that was not true
Neer made less beautiful the blue
Unclouded heaven of her eyes

She is a woman one in whom
The springtime of her childish years
Hath never lost its fresh perfume
Though knowing well that life hath room
For many blights and many tears

I love her with a love as still
As a broad rivers peaceful might
Which by high tower and lowly mill
Seems following its own wayward will
And yet doth ever flow aright

And on its full deep breast serene
Like quiet isles my duties lie
It flows around them and between
And makes them fresh and fair and green
Sweet homes wherein to live and die

James Russell Lowell 18191891


MARGARET TO DOLCINO

Ask if I love thee Oh smiles cannot tell
Plainer what tears are now showing too well
Had I not loved thee my sky had been clear
Had I not loved thee I had not been here
Weeping by thee

Ask if I love thee How else could I borrow
Pride from mans slander and strength from my sorrow
Laugh when they sneer at the fanatics bride
Knowing no bliss save to toil and abide
Weeping by thee

Charles Kingsley 18191875


DOLCINO TO MARGARET

The world goes up and the world goes down
And the sunshine follows the rain
And yesterdays sneer and yesterdays frown
Can never come over again
Sweet wife
No never come over again

For woman is warm though man be cold
And the night will hallow the day
Till the heart which at even was weary and old
Can rise in the morning gay
Sweet wife
To its work in the morning gay

Charles Kingsley 18191875


AT LAST

When first the bride and bridegroom wed
They love their single selves the best
A sword is in the marriage bed
Their separate slumbers are not rest
They quarrel and make up again
They give and suffer worlds of pain
Both right and wrong
They struggle long
Till some good day when they are old
Some dark day when the bells are tolled
Death having taken their best of life
They lose themselves and find each other
They know that they are husband wife
For weeping they are Father Mother

Richard Henry Stoddard 18251903


THE WIFE TO HER HUSBAND

Linger not long Home is not home without thee
Its dearest tokens do but make me mourn
O let its memory like a chain about thee
Gently compel and hasten thy return

Linger not long Though crowds should woo thy staying
Bethink thee can the mirth of thy friends though dear
Compensate for the grief thy long delaying
Costs the fond heart that sighs to have thee here

Linger not long How shall I watch thy coming
As evening shadows stretch oer moor and dell
When the wild bee hath ceased her busy humming
And silence hangs on all things like a spell

How shall I watch for thee when fears grow stronger
As night grows dark and darker on the hill
How shall I weep when I can watch no longer
Ah art thou absent art thou absent still

Yet I shall grieve not though the eye that seeth me
Gazeth through tears that make its splendor dull
For oh I sometimes fear when thou art with me
My cup of happiness is all too full

Haste haste thee home unto thy mountain dwelling
Haste as a bird unto its peaceful nest
Haste as a skiff through tempests wide and swelling
Flies to its haven of securest rest

Unknown


A WIFES SONG

O well I love the Spring
When the sweet sweet hawthorn blows
And well I love the Summer
And the coming of the rose
But dearer are the changing leaf
And the year upon the wane
For O they bring the blessed time
That brings him home again

November may be dreary
Decembers days may be
As full of gloom to others
As once they were to me
But O to hear the tempest
Beat loud against the pane
For the roaring wind and the blessed time
That brings him home again

William Cox Bennett 18201895


THE SAILORS WIFE

And are ye sure the news is true
And are ye sure hes weel
Is this a time to talk o wark
Ye jauds fling by your wheel
Is this a time to spin a thread
When Colins at the door
Rax down my cloak  Ill to the quay
And see him come ashore
For theres nae luck aboot the house
Theres nae luck ava
Theres little pleasure in the house
When our gudemans awa

And gie to me my bigonet
My bishops satin gown
For I maun tell the baillies wife
That Colins in the town
My Turkey slippers maun gae on
My stockins pearly blue
Its a to pleasure our gudeman
For hes baith leal and true

Rise lass and mak a clean fireside
Put on the muckle pot
Gie little Kate her button gown
And Jock his Sunday coat
And mak their shoon as black as slaes
Their hose as white as snaw
Its a to please my own gudeman
He likes to see them braw

Theres twa hens upon the bauk
Hae fed this month and mair
Mak haste and thraw their necks about
That Colin weel may fare
And spread the table neat and clean
Gar ilka thing look braw
For wha can tell how Colin fared
When he was far awa

Sae true his heart sae smooth his speech
His breath like caller air
His very foot has music int
As he comes up the stair
And will I see his face again
And will I hear him speak
Im downright dizzy wi the thought
In troth Im like to greet

If Colins weel and weel content
I hae nae mair to crave
And gin I live to keep him sae
Im blest abune the lave
And will I see his face again
And will I hear him speak
Im downright dizzy wi the thought
In troth Im like to greet
For theres nae luck aboot the house
Theres nae luck ava
Theres little pleasure in the house
When our gudemans awa

JERRY AN ME

No matter how the chances are
Nor when the winds may blow
My Jerry there has left the sea
With all its luck an woe
For who would try the sea at all
Must try it luck or no

They told him  Lor men take no care
How words they speak may fall 
They told him blunt he was too old
Too slow with oar an trawl
An this is how he left the sea
An luck an woe an all

Take any man on sea or land
Out of his beaten way
If he is young twill do but then
If he is old an gray
A month will be a year to him
Be all to him you may

He sits by me but most he walks
The dooryard for a deck
An scans the boat agoin out
Till she becomes a speck
Then turns away his face as wet
As if she were a wreck

I cannot bring him back again
The days when we were wed
But he shall never know  my man 
The lack o love or bread
While I can cast a stitch or fill
A needleful o thread

God pity me Id most forgot
How many yet there be
Whose goodmen full as old as mine
Are somewhere on the sea
Who hear the breakin bar an think
O Jerry home an  me

Hiram Rich 18321901


DONT BE SORROWFUL DARLING

O dont be sorrowful darling
And dont be sorrowful pray
Taking the year together my dear
There isnt more night than day

Tis rainy weather my darling
Times waves they heavily run
But taking the year together my dear
There isnt more cloud than sun

We are old folks now my darling
Our heads are growing gray
But taking the year all round my dear
You will always find the May

We have had our May my darling
And our roses long ago
And the time of the year is coming my dear
For the silent night and the snow

But God is God my darling
Of the night as well as the day
And we feel and know that we can go
Wherever He leads the way

A God of the night my darling
Of the night of death so grim
The gate that leads out of life good wife
Is the gate that leads to Him

Rembrandt Peale 17781860


WINIFREDA

Away let naught to love displeasing
My Winifreda move your care
Let naught delay the heavenly blessing
Nor squeamish pride nor gloomy fear

What though no grants of royal donors
With pompous titles grace our blood
Well shine in more substantial honors
And to be noble well be good

Our name while virtue thus we tender
Will sweetly sound whereer tis spoke
And all the great ones they shall wonder
How they respect such little folk

What though from fortunes lavish bounty
No mighty treasures we possess
Well find within our pittance plenty
And be content without excess

Still shall each kind returning season
Sufficient for our wishes give
For we will live life of reason
And thats the only life to live

Through youth and age in love excelling
Well hand in hand together tread
Sweet smiling peace shall crown our dwelling
And babes sweet smiling babes our bed

How should I love the pretty creatures
While round my knees they fondly clung
To see them look their mothers features
To hear them lisp their mothers tongue

And when with envy time transported
Shall think to rob us of our joys
Youll in your girls again be courted
And Ill go wooing in my boys

Unknown


AN OLD MANS IDYL

By the waters of Life we sat together
Hand in hand in the golden days
Of the beautiful early summer weather
When skies were purple and breath was praise
When the heart kept tune to the carol of birds
And the birds kept tune to the songs which ran
Through shimmer of flowers on grassy swards
And trees with voices aeolian

By the rivers of Life we walked together
I and my darling unafraid
And lighter than any linnets feather
The burdens of being on us weighed
And Loves sweet miracles oer us threw
Mantles of joy outlasting Time
And up from the rosy morrows grew
A sound that seemed like a marriage chime

In the gardens of Life we strayed together
And the luscious apples were ripe and red
And the languid lilac and honeyed heather
Swooned with the fragrance which they shed
And under the trees the angels walked
And up in the air a sense of wings
Awed us tenderly while we talked
Softly in sacred communings

In the meadows of Life we strayed together
Watching the waving harvests grow
And under the benison of the Father
Our hearts like the lambs skipped to and fro
And the cowslip hearing our low replies
Broidered fairer the emerald banks
And glad tears shone in the daisys eyes
And the timid violet glistened thanks

Who was with us and what was round us
Neither myself nor my darling guessed
Only we knew that something crowned us
Out from the heavens with crowns of rest
Only we knew that something bright
Lingered lovingly where we stood
Clothed with the incandescent light
Of something higher than humanhood

Oh the riches Love doth inherit
Oh the alchemy which doth change
Dross of body and dregs of spirit
Into sanctities rare and strange
My flesh is feeble and dry and old
My darlings beautiful hair is gray
But our elixir and precious gold
Laugh at the footsteps of decay

Harms of the world have come unto us
Cups of sorrow we yet shall drain
But we have a secret which doth show us
Wonderful rainbows in the rain
And we hear the tread of the years move by
And the sun is setting behind the hills
But my darling does not fear to die
And I am happy in what God wills

So we sit by our household fires together
Dreaming the dreams of long ago
Then it was balmy sunny weather
And now the valleys are laid in snow
Icicles hang from the slippery eaves
The wind blows cold  tis growing late
Well well we have garnered all our sheaves
I and my darling and we wait

Richard Realf 18341878


THE POETS SONG TO HIS WIFE

How many summers love
Have I been thine
How many days thou dove
Hast thou been mine
Time like the winged wind
When it bends the flowers
Hath left no mark behind
To count the hours

Some weight of thought though loth
On thee he leaves
Some lines of care round both
Perhaps he weaves
Some fears  a soft regret
For joys scarce known
Sweet looks we half forget 
All else is flown

Ah  With what thankless heart
I mourn and sing
Look where our children start
Like sudden Spring
With tongues all sweet and low
Like a pleasant rhyme
They tell how much I owe
To thee and Time

Bryan Waller Procter 17871874


JOHN ANDERSON

John Anderson my jo John
When we were first acquent
Your locks were like the raven
Your bonnie brow was brent
But now your brow is bald John
Your locks are like the snow
But blessings on your frosty pow

John Anderson my jo John
We clamb the hill thegither
And mony a canty day John
Weve had wi ane anither
Now we maun totter down John
But hand in hand well go
And sleep thegither at the foot

TO MARY

Thee Mary with this ring I wed
So fourteen years ago I said 
Behold another ring  For what
To wed thee oer again  why not

With that first ring I married Youth
Grace Beauty Innocence and Truth
Taste long admired sense long revered
And all my Molly then appeared
If she by merit since disclosed
Prove twice the woman I supposed
I plead that double merit now
To justify a double vow

Here then today with faith as sure
With ardor as intense and pure
As when amidst the rites divine
I took thy troth and plighted mine
To thee sweet girl my second ring
A token and a pledge I bring
With this I wed till death us part
Thy riper virtues to my heart
Those virtues which before untried
The wife has added to the bride
Those virtues whose progessive claim
Endearing wedlocks very name
My soul enjoys my song approves
For Conscience sake as well as Loves

For why  They show me every hour
Honors high thought Affections power
Discretions deed sound Judgments sentence
And teach me all things  but Repentance

Samuel Bishop 17311795


THE GOLDEN WEDDING

O Love whose patient pilgrim feet
Lifes longest path have trod
Whose ministry hath symbolled sweet
The dearer love of God
The sacred myrtle wreathes again
Thine altar as of old
And what was green with summer then
Is mellowed now to gold

Not now as then the futures face
Is flushed with fancys light
But memory with a milder grace
Shall rule the feast tonight
Blest was the sun of joy that shone
Nor less the blinding shower
The bud of fifty years agone
Is loves perfected flower

O memory ope thy mystic door
O dream of youth return
And let the light that gleamed of yore
Beside this altar burn
The past is plain twas love designed
Een sorrows iron chain
And mercys shining thread has twined
With the dark warp of pain

So be it still O Thou who hast
That younger bridal blest
Till the Maymorn of love has passed
To evenings golden west
Come to this later Cana Lord
And at thy touch divine
The water of that earlier board
Tonight shall turn to wine

David Gray 18371888


MOGGY AND ME

Oh wha are sae happy as me an my Moggy
Oh wha are sae happy as Moggy an me
Were baith turnin auld an our walth is soon tauld
But contentment bides aye in our cottage sae wee
She toils a the day when Im out wi the hirsel
An chants to the bairns while I sing on the brae
An aye her blithe smile welcomes me frae my toil
When down the glen I come weary an wae

Aboon our auld heads weve a nice little biggin
That keeps out the cauld when the simmers awa
Weve twa webs o linen o Moggys ain spinnin
As thick as silk velvet and white as the snaw
Weve kye in the byre an yauds in the stable
A grumphie sae fat that she hardly can stand
An something I guess in yon auld painted press
To cheer up the speerits an steady the hand

Tis true we hae had mony sorrows an crosses
Our pouches oft toom an our hearts fu o care
But wi a our crosses our sorrows an losses
Contentment thank heaven has aye been our share
Ive an auld roostit sword that was left by my father
Whilk aye has been drawn when my king had a fae
We hae friends ane or twa that aft gie us a ca
To laugh when were happy or grieve when were wae

Our duke may hae gowd mair than schoolmen can reckon
An flunkies to watch ilka glance o his ee
His lady aye braw sittin prim in her ha
But are they sae happy as Moggy an me
A ye wha neer fand the straight road to be happy
Wha are nae content wi the lot that ye dree
Come down to the dwellin o whilk Ive been tellin
Youll learn it by lookin at Moggy an me

James Hogg 17701835


O LAY THY HAND IN MINE DEAR

O lay thy hand in mine dear
Were growing old
But Time hath brought no sign dear
That hearts grow cold
Tis long long since our new love
Made life divine
But age enricheth true love
Like noble wine

And lay thy cheek to mine dear
And take thy rest
Mine arms around thee twine dear
And make thy nest
A many cares are pressing
On this dear head
But Sorrows hands in blessing
Are surely laid

O lean thy life on mine dear
Twill shelter thee
Thou wert a winsome vine dear
On my young tree
And so till boughs are leafless
And songbirds flown
Well twine then lay us griefless
Together down

Gerald Massey 18281907


THE EXEQUY

Accept thou shrine of my dead saint
Instead of dirges this complaint
And for sweet flowers to crown thy hearse
Receive a strew of weeping verse
From thy grieved friend whom thou mightst see
Quite melted into tears for thee
Dear loss since thy untimely fate
My task hath been to meditate
On thee on thee thou art the book
The library whereon I look
Though almost blind For thee loved clay
I languish out not live the day
Using no other exercise
But which I practise with mine eyes
By which wet glasses I find out
How lazily time creeps about
To one that mourns this only this
My exercise and business is
So I compute the weary hours
With sighs dissolved into showers

Nor wonder if my time go thus
Backward and most preposterous
Thou hast benighted me thy set
This eve of blackness did beget
Who wast my day though overcast
Before thou hadst thy noontide passed
And I remember must in tears
Thou scarce hadst seen so many years
As day tells hours By thy clear sun
My love and fortune first did run
But thou wilt never more appear
Folded within my hemisphere
Since both thy light and motion
Like a fled star is fallen and gone
And twixt me and my souls dear wish
The earth now interposed is
Which such a strange eclipse doth make
As neer was read in almanac

I could allow thee for a time
To darken me and my sad clime
Were it a month a year or ten
I would thy exile live till then
And all that space my mirth adjourn
So thou wouldst promise to return
And putting off thy ashy shroud
At length disperse this sorrows cloud
But woe is me the longest date
Too narrow is to calculate
These empty hopes never shall I
Be so much blest as to descry
A glimpse of thee till that day come
Which shall the earth to cinders doom
And a fierce fever must calcine
The body of this world  like thine
My little world That fit of fire
Once off our bodies shall aspire
To our souls bliss then we shall rise
And view ourselves with clearer eyes
In that calm region where no night
Can hide us from each others sight

Meantime thou hast her earth much good
May my harm do thee Since it stood
With Heavens will I might not call
Her longer mine I give thee all
My shortlived right and interest
In her whom living I loved best
With a most free and bounteous grief
I give thee what I could not keep
Be kind to her and prithee look
Thou write into thy Doomsday book
Each parcel of this rarity
Which in thy casket shrined doth lie
See that thou make thy reckoning straight
And yield her back again by weight
For thou must audit on thy trust
Each grain and atom of this dust
As thou wilt answer Him that lent 
Not gave  thee my dear monument
So close the ground and bout her shade
Black curtains draw my bride is laid

Sleep on my Love in thy cold bed
Never to be disquieted
My last goodnight Thou wilt not wake
Till I thy fate shall overtake
Till age or grief or sickness must
Marry my body to that dust
It so much loves and fill the room
My heart keeps empty in thy tomb
Stay for me there I will not fail
To meet thee in that hollow vale
And think not much of my delay
I am already on the way
And follow thee with all the speed
Desire can make or sorrows breed
Each minute is a short degree
And every hour a step towards thee
At night when I betake to rest
Next morn I rise nearer my west
Of life almost by eight hours sail
Than when sleep breathed his drowsy gale

Thus from the Sun my bottom steers
And my days compass downward bears
Nor labor I to stem the tide
Through which to thee I swiftly glide
Tis true with shame and grief I yield
Thou like the van first tookst the field
And gotten hast the victory
In thus adventuring to die
Before me whose more years might crave
A just precedence in the grave
But hark my pulse like a soft drum
Beats my approach tells thee I come
And slow howeer my marches be
I shall at last sit down by thee

The thought of this bids me go on
And wait my dissolution
With hope and comfort Dear forgive
The crime I am content to live
Divided with but half a heart
Till we shall meet and never part

Henry King 15921669







LOVE SONNETS






SONNETS
From Amoretti

 III
The sovereign beauty which I do admire
Witness the world how worthy to be praised
The light whereof hath kindled heavenly fire
In my frail spirit by her from baseness raised
That being now with her huge brightness dazed
Base thing I can no more endure to view
But looking still on her I stand amazed
At wondrous sight of so celestial hue
So when my tongue would speak her praises due
It stopped is with thoughts astonishment
And when my pen would write her titles true
It ravished is with fancys wonderment
Yet in my heart I then both speak and write
The wonder that my wit cannot indite

 VIII
More than most fair full of the living fire
Kindled above unto the Maker near
No eyes but joys in which all powers conspire
That to the world naught else be counted dear
Through your bright beams doth not the blinded guest
Shoot out his darts to base affections wound
But angels come to lead frail minds to rest
In chaste desires on heavenly beauty bound
You frame my thoughts and fashion me within
You stop my tongue and teach my heart to speak
You calm the storm that passion did begin
Strong through your cause but by your virtue weak
Dark is the world where your light shined never
Well is he born that may behold you ever

 XXIV
When I behold that beautys wonderment
And rare perfection of each goodly part
Of Natures still the only complement
I honor and admire the Makers art
But when I feel the bitter baleful smart
Which her fair eyes unwares do work in me
That death out of their shiny beams do dart
I think that I a new Pandora see
Whom all the gods in council did agree
Into this sinful world from heaven to send
That she to wicked men a scourge should be
For all their faults with which they did offend
But since ye are my scourge I will entreat
That for my faults ye will me gently beat

 XXXIV
Like as a ship that through the ocean wide
By conduct of some star doth make her way
Whenas a storm hath dimmed her trusty guide
Out of her course doth wander far astray
So I whose star that wont with her bright ray
Me to direct with clouds is overcast
Do wander now in darkness and dismay
Through hidden perils round about me placed
Yet hope I well that when this storm is past
My Helice the lodestar of my life
Will shine again and look on me at last
With lovely light to clear my cloudy grief
Till then I wander carefull comfortless
In secret sorrow and sad pensiveness

 LV
So oft as I her beauty do behold
And therewith do her cruelty compare
I marvel of what substance was the mould
The which her made at once so cruel fair
Not earth for her high thoughts more heavenly are
Not water for her love doth burn like fire
Not air for she is not so light or rare
Not fire for she doth freeze with faint desire
Then needs another element inquire
Whereof she might be made  that is the sky
For to the heaven her haughty looks aspire
And eke her mind is pure immortal high
Then since to heaven ye likened are the best
Be like in mercy as in all the rest

 LXVIII
Most glorious Lord of Life that on this day
Didst make thy triumph over death and sin
And having harrowed hell didst bring away
Captivity thence captive us to win
This joyous day dear Lord with joy begin
And grant that we for whom thou diddest die
Being with thy dear blood clean washed from sin
May live forever in felicity
And that thy love we weighing worthily
May likewise love thee for the same again
And for thy sake that all like dear didst buy
With love may one another entertain
So let us love dear Love like as we ought
Love is the lesson which the Lord us taught

 LXX
Fresh Spring the herald of loves mighty king
In whose coatarmor richly are displayed
All sorts of flowers the which on earth do spring
In goodly colors gloriously arrayed
Go to my love where she is careless laid
Yet in her winters bower not well awake
Tell her the joyous time will not be stayed
Unless she do him by the forelock take
Bid her therefore herself soon ready make
To wait on Love amongst his lovely crew
Where everyone that misseth then her mate
Shall be by him amerced with penance due
Make haste therefore sweet love whilst it is prime
For none can call again the passed time

 LXXV
One day I wrote her name upon the strand
But came the waves and washed it away
Again I wrote it with a second hand
But came the tide and made my pains his prey
Vain man said she that dost in vain essay
A mortal thing so to immortalize
For I myself shall like to this decay
And eke my name be wiped out likewise
Not so quoth I let baser things devise
To die in dust but you shall live by fame
My verse your virtues rare shall eternize
And in the heavens write your glorious name
Where whenas Death shall all the world subdue
Our love shall live and later life renew

 LXXIX
Men call you fair and you do credit it
For that yourself ye daily such do see
But the true fair that is the gentle wit
And virtuous mind is much more praised of me
For all the rest however fair it be
Shall turn to naught and lose that glorious hue
But only that is permanent and free
From frail corruption that doth flesh ensue
That is true beauty that doth argue you
To be divine and born of heavenly seed
Derived from that fair Spirit from whom all true
And perfect beauty did at first proceed
He only fair and what he fair hath made
All other fair like flowers untimely fade

Edmund Spenser 15521599


SONNETS
From Astrophel and Stella

 I
Loving in truth and fain in verse my love to show
That She dear She might take some pleasure of my pain
Pleasure might cause her read reading might make her know
Knowledge might pity win and pity grace obtain
I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe
Studying inventions fine her wits to entertain
Oft turning others leaves to see if thence would flow
Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburnt brain
But words came halting forth wanting Inventions stay
Invention Natures child fled stepdame Studys blows
And others feet still seemed but strangers in my way
Thus great with child to speak and helpless in my throes
Biting my truant pen beating myself for spite
Fool said my Muse to me look in thy heart and write

 XXXI
With how sad steps O Moon thou climbst the skies
How silently and with how wan a face
What may it be that even in heavenly place
That busy archer his sharp arrows tries
Sure if that longwithloveacquainted eyes
Can judge of love thou feelst a lovers case
I read it in thy looks Thy languished grace
To me that feel the like thy state descries
Then even of fellowship O Moon tell me
Is constant love deemed there but want of wit
Are beauties there as proud as here they be
Do they above love to be loved and yet
Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess
Do they call virtue there ungratefulness

 XXXIX
Come Sleep O Sleep the certain knot of peace
The baitingplace of wit the balm of woe
The poor mans wealth the prisoners release
The indifferent judge between the high and low
With shield of proof shield me from out the press
Of those fierce darts Despair at me doth throw
O make in me those civil wars to cease
I will good tribute pay if thou do so
Take thou of me smooth pillows sweetest bed
A chamber deaf to noise and blind to light
A rosy garland and a weary head
And if these things as being thine in right
Move not thy heavy grace thou shalt in me
Livelier than elsewhere Stellas image see

 LXII
Late tired with woe even ready for to pine
With rage of love I called my Love unkind
She in whose eyes love though unfelt doth shine
Sweet said that I true love in her should find
I joyed but straight thus watered was my wine
That love she did but loved a love not blind
Which would not let me whom she loved decline
From nobler cause fit for my birth and mind
And therefore by her loves authority
Willed me these tempests of vain love to fly
And anchor fast myself on Virtues shore
Alas if this the only metal be
Of love newcoined to help my beggary
Dear love me not that ye may love me more

 LXIV
No more my Dear no more these counsels try
O give my passions leave to run their race
Let Fortune lay on me her worst disgrace
Let folk oercharged with brain against me cry
Let clouds bedim my face break in mine eye
Let me no steps but of lost labor trace
Let all the earth with scorn recount my case
But do not will me from my love to fly
I do not envy Aristotles wit
Nor do aspire to Caesars bleeding fame
Nor aught do care though some above me sit
Nor hope nor wish another course to frame
But that which once may win thy cruel heart
Thou art my Wit and thou my Virtue art

 LXXIII
Love still a boy and oft a wanton is
Schooled only by his mothers tender eye
What wonder then if he his lesson miss
When for so soft a rod dear play he try
And yet my Star because a sugared kiss
In sport I sucked while she asleep did lie
Doth lower nay chide nay threat for only this 
Sweet it was saucy Love not humble I
But no scuse serves she makes her wrath appear
In Beautys throne see now who dares come near
Those scarlet judges threatening bloody pain
O heavenly fool thy most kissworthy face
Anger invests with such a lovely grace
That Angers self I needs must kiss again

 CIII
O happy Thames that didst my Stella bear
I saw thee with full many a smiling line
Upon thy cheerful face Joys livery wear
While those fair planets on thy streams did shine
The boat for joy could not to dance forbear
While wanton winds with beauties so divine
Ravished stayed not till in her golden hair
They did themselves O sweetest prison twine
And fain those Aeols youths there would their stay
Have made but forced by Nature still to fly
First did with puffing kiss those locks display
She so dishevelled blushed From window I
With sight thereof cried out O fair disgrace
Let Honors self to thee grant highest place

 CVII
Stella since thou so right a Princess art
Of all the powers which life bestows on me
That ere by them aught undertaken be
They first resort unto that sovereign part
Sweet for a while give respite to my heart
Which pants as though it still should leap to thee
And on my thoughts give thy lieutenancy
To this great cause which needs both use and art
And as a Queen who from her presence sends
Whom she employs dismiss from thee my wit
Till it have wrought what thy own will attends
On servants shame oft masters blame doth sit
O let not fools in me thy works reprove
And scorning say See what it is to love

Philip Sidney 15541586


SONNETS
From To Delia

 VI
Fair is my Love and cruel as shes fair
Her brow shades frowns although her eyes are sunny
Her smiles are lightning though her pride despair
And her disdains are gall her favors honey
A modest maid decked with a blush of honor
Whose feet do tread green paths of youth and love
The wonder of all eyes that look upon her
Sacred on earth designed a Saint above
Chastity and Beauty which were deadly foes
Live reconciled friends within her brow
And had she Pity to conjoin with those
Then who had heard the plaints I utter now
O had she not been fair and thus unkind
My Muse had slept and none had known my mind

 XII
My spotless love hovers with purest wings
About the temple of the proudest frame
Where blaze those lights fairest of earthly things
Which clear our clouded world with brightest flame
My ambitious thoughts confined in her face
Affect no honor but what she can give
My hopes do rest in limits of her grace
I weigh no comfort unless she relieve
For she that can my heart imparadise
Holds in her fairest hand what dearest is
My Fortunes Wheels the Circle of her Eyes
Whose rolling grace deign once a turn of bliss
All my lifes sweet consists in her alone
So much I love the most unloving one

 XXX
And yet I cannot reprehend the flight
Or blame the attempt presuming so to soar
The mounting venture for a high delight
Did make the honor of the fall the more
For who gets wealth that puts not from the shore
Danger hath honor great designs their fame
Glory doth follow courage goes before
And though the event oft answers not the same
Suffice that high attempts have never shame
The Meanobserver whom base safety keeps
Lives without honor dies without a name
And in eternal darkness ever sleeps
And therefore Delia tis to me no blot
To have attempted though attained thee not

 XXXVI
When men shall find thy flower thy glory pass
And thou with careful brow sitting alone
Received hast this message from thy glass
That tells the truth and says that All is gone
Fresh shalt thou see in me the wounds thou madest
Though spent thy flame in me the heat remaining
I that have loved thee thus before thou fadest
My faith shall wax when thou art in thy waning
The world shall find this miracle in me
That fire can burn when all the matters spent
Then what my faith hath been thyself shalt see
And that thou wast unkind thou mayst repent
Thou mayst repent that thou hast scorned my tears
When Winter snows upon thy golden hairs

 XXXIX
Look Delia how we esteem the halfblown rose
The image of thy blush and Summers honor
Whilst yet her tender bud doth undisclose
That full of beauty Time bestows upon her
No sooner spreads her glory in the air
But straight her wideblown pomp comes to decline
She then is scorned that late adorned the fair
So fade the roses of those cheeks of thine
No April can revive thy withered flowers
Whose springing grace adorns thy glory now
Swift speedy Time feathered with flying hours
Dissolves the beauty of the fairest brow
Then do not thou such treasure waste in vain
But love now whilst thou mayst be loved again

 XLV
Beauty sweet Love is like the morning dew
Whose short refresh upon the tender green
Cheers for a time but till the sun doth show
And straight tis gone as it had never been
Soon doth it fade that makes the fairest flourish
Short is the glory of the blushing rose
The hue which thou so carefully dost nourish
Yet which at length thou must be forced to lose
When thou surcharged with burthen of thy years
Shalt bend thy wrinkles homeward to the earth
When Time hath made a passport for thy fears
Dated in Age the Calends of our Death
But ah no more This hath been often told
And women grieve to think they must be old

 XLVI
I must not grieve my Love whose eyes would read
Lines of delight whereon her youth might smile
Flowers have a time before they come to seed
And she is young and now must sport the while
And sport Sweet Maid in season of these years
And learn to gather flowers before they wither
And where the sweetest blossom first appears
Let Love and Youth conduct thy pleasures thither
Lighten forth smiles to clear the clouded air
And calm the tempest which my sighs do raise
Pity and smiles do best become the fair
Pity and smiles shall yield thee lasting praise
I hope to say when all my griefs are gone
Happy the heart that sighed for such a one

 L
Let others sing of Knights and Paladines
In aged accents and untimely words
Paint shadows in imaginary lines
Which well the reach of their high wit records
But I must sing of Thee and those fair eyes
Authentic shall my verse in time to come
When the yet unborn shall say Lo where she lies
Whose beauty made him speak that else was dumb
These are the arks the trophies I erect
That fortify thy name against old age
And these thy sacred virtues must protect
Against the Dark and Times consuming rage
Though the error of my youth in them appear
Suffice they showed I lived and loved thee dear

 LI
Carecharmer Sleep son of the sable Night
Brother to Death in silent darkness born
Relieve my languish and restore the light
With dark forgetting of my care return
And let the day be time enough to mourn
The shipwreck of my illadventured youth
Let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn
Without the torment of the nights untruth
Cease dreams the images of daydesires
To model forth the passions of the morrow
Never let rising sun approve you liars
To add more grief to aggravate my sorrow
Still let me sleep embracing clouds in vain
And never wake to feel the days disdain

Samuel Daniel 15621619


SONNETS
From Idea
To The Reader Of These Sonnets

Into these Loves who but for Passion looks
At this first sight here let him lay them by
And seek elsewhere in turning other books
Which better may his labor satisfy
No farfetched sigh shall ever wound my breast
Love from mine eye a tear shall never wring
Nor in Ah mes my whining sonnets dressed
A libertine fantasticly I sing
My verse is the true image of my mind
Ever in motion still desiring change
And as thus to variety inclined
So in all humors sportively I range
My Muse is rightly of the English strain
That cannot long one fashion entertain

 IV
Bright Star of Beauty on whose eyelids sit
A thousand nymphlike and enamored Graces
The Goddesses of Memory and Wit
Which there in order take their several places
In whose dear bosom sweet delicious Love
Lays down his quiver which he once did bear
Since he that blessed paradise did prove
And leaves his mothers lap to sport him there
Let others strive to entertain with words
My soul is of a braver mettle made
I hold that vile which vulgar wit affords
In mes that faith which Time cannot invade
Let what I praise be still made good by you
Be you most worthy whilst I am most true

 XX
An evil Spirit your Beauty haunts me still
Wherewith alas I have been long possessed
Which ceaseth not to attempt me to each ill
Nor give me once but one poor minutes rest
In me it speaks whether I sleep or wake
And when by means to drive it out I try
With greater torments then it me doth take
And tortures me in most extremity
Before my face it lays down my despairs
And hastes me on unto a sudden death
Now tempting me to drown myself in tears
And then in sighing to give up my breath
Thus am I still provoked to every evil
By this goodwicked Spirit sweet AngelDevil

 XXXVII
Dear why should you command me to my rest
When now the night doth summon all to sleep
Methinks this time becometh lovers best
Night was ordained together friends to keep
How happy are all other living things
Which through the day disjoined by several flight
The quiet evening yet together brings
And each returns unto his Love at night
O thou that art so courteous else to all
Why shouldst thou Night abuse me only thus
That every creature to his kind doth call
And yet tis thou dost only sever us
Well could I wish it would be ever day
If when night comes you bid me go away

 XL
My heart the Anvil where my thoughts do beat
My words the Hammers fashioning my Desire
My breast the Forge including all the heat
Love is the Fuel which maintains the fire
My sighs the Bellows which the flame increaseth
Filling mine ears with noise and nightly groaning
Toiling with pain my labor never ceaseth
In grievous Passions my woes still bemoaning
My eyes with tears against the fire striving
Whose scorching glede my heart to cinders turneth
But with those drops the flame again reviving
Still more and more it to my torment burneth
With Sisyphus thus do I roll the stone
And turn the wheel with damned Ixion

 XLII
How many paltry foolish painted things
That now in coaches trouble every street
Shall be forgotten whom no poet sings
Ere they be well wrapped in their windingsheet
Where I to thee eternity shall give
When nothing else remaineth of these days
And queens hereafter shall be glad to live
Upon the alms of thy superfluous praise
Virgins and matrons reading these my rhymes
Shall be so much delighted with thy story
That they shall grieve they lived not in these times
To have seen thee their sexs only glory
So shalt thou fly above the vulgar throng
Still to survive in my immortal song

 LXI
Since theres no help come let us kiss and part
Nay I have done You get no more of me
And I am glad yea glad with all my heart
That thus so cleanly I myself can free
Shake hands for ever Cancel all our vows
And when we meet at any time again
Be it not seen in either of our brows
That we one jot of former love retain
Now at the last gasp of Loves latest breath
When his pulse failing Passion speechless lies
When Faith is kneeling by his bed of death
And Innocence is closing up his eyes
Now if thou wouldst when all have given him over
From death to life thou mightst him yet recover

Michael Drayton 15631631


SONNETS
From Diana

 IX
My Ladys presence makes the Roses red
Because to see her lips they blush for shame
The Lilys leaves for envy pale became
And her white hands in them this envy bred
The Marigold the leaves abroad doth spread
Because the suns and her power is the same
The Violet of purple color came
Dyed in the blood she made my heart to shed
In brief all flowers from her their virtue take
From her sweet breath their sweet smells do proceed
The living heat which her eyebeams doth make
Warmeth the ground and quickeneth the seed
The rain wherewith she watereth the flowers
Falls from mine eyes which she dissolves in showers

 LXII
To live in hell and heaven to behold
To welcome life and die a living death
To sweat with heat and yet be freezing cold
To grasp at stars and lie the earth beneath
To tread a maze that never shall have end
To burn in sighs and starve in daily tears
To climb a hill and never to descend
Giants to kill and quake at childish fears
To pine for food and watch the Hesperian tree
To thirst for drink and nectar still to draw
To live accurst whom men hold blest to be
And weep those wrongs which never creature saw
If this be love if love in these be founded
My heart is love for these in it are grounded

Henry Constable  15621613


SONNETS

 XVIII
Shall I compare thee to a Summers day
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
And Summers lease hath all too short a date
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
And often is his gold complexion dimmed
And every fair from fair sometime declines
By chance or natures changing course untrimmed
But thy eternal Summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest
Nor shall Death brag thou wanderest in his shade
When in eternal lines to time thou growest
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see
So long lives this and this gives life to thee

 XXIII
As an unperfect actor on the stage
Who with his fear is put besides his part
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
Whose strengths abundance weakens his own heart
So I for fear of trust forget to say
The perfect ceremony of loves rite
And in mine own loves strength seem to decay
Oercharged with burden of mine own loves might
O let my books be then the eloquence
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast
Who plead for love and look for recompense
More than that tongue that more hath more expressed
O learn to read what silent love hath writ
To hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit

 XXIX
When in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes
I all alone beweep my outcast state
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
And look upon myself and curse my fate
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope
Featured like him like him with friends possessed
Desiring this mans art and that mans scope
With what I most enjoy contented least
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising
Haply I think on thee and then my state
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings

 XXX
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
I summon up remembrance of things past
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought
And with old woes new wail my dear times waste
Then can I drown an eye unused to flow
For precious friends hid in deaths dateless night
And weep afresh loves longsince cancelled woe
And moan the expense of many a vanished sight
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone
And heavily from woe to woe tell oer
The sad account of forebemoaned moan
Which I new pay as if not paid before
But if the while I think on thee dear friend
All losses are restored and sorrows end

 XXXII
If thou survive my wellcontented day
When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover
And shalt by fortune once more resurvey
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover
Compare them with the bettering of the time
And though they be outstripped by every pen
Reserve them for my love not for their rhyme
Exceeded by the height of happier men
O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought
Had my friends Muse grown with this growing age
A dearer birth than this his love had brought
To march in ranks of better equipage
But since he died and poets better prove
Theirs for their style Ill read his for his love

 XXXIII
Full many a glorious morning have I seen
Flatter the mountaintops with sovereign eye
Kissing with golden lace the meadows green
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
With ugly rack on his celestial face
And from the forlorn world his visage hide
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
Even so my sun one early morn did shine
With alltriumphant splendor on my brow
But out alack he was but one hour mine
The region cloud hath masked him from me now
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
Suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth

 LX
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
So do our minutes hasten to their end
Each changing place with that which goes before
In sequent toil all forwards do contend
Nativity once in the main of light
Crawls to maturity wherewith being crowned
Crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
And delves the parallels in beautys brow
Feeds on the rarities of natures truth
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
Praising thy worth despite his cruel hand

 LXXI
No longer mourn for me when I am dead
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
Give warning to the world that I am fled
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell
Nay if you read this line remember not
The hand that writ it for I love you so
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
If thinking on me then should make you woe
O if I say you look upon this verse
When I perhaps compounded am with clay
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse
But let your love even with my life decay
Lest the wise world should look into your moan
And mock you with me after I am gone

 LXXIII
That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves or none or few do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold
Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang
In me thou seest the twilight of such day
As after sunset fadeth in the west
Which by and by black night doth take away
Deaths second self that seals up all in rest
In me thou seest the glowing of such fire
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie
As the deathbed whereon it must expire
Consumed with that which it was nourished by
This thou perceivst which makes thy love more strong
To love that well which thou must leave ere long

 CIV
To me fair friend you never can be old
For as you were when first your eye I eyed
Such seems your beauty still Three Winters cold
Have from the forests shook three Summers pride
Three beauteous Springs to yellow Autumn turned
In process of the seasons have I seen
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned
Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green
Ah yet doth beauty like a dialhand
Steal from his figure and no pace perceived
So your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand
Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived
For fear of which hear this thou age unbred
Ere you were born was beautys Summer dead

 CVI
When in the chronicle of wasted time
I see descriptions of the fairest wights
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights
Then in the blazon of sweet beautys best
Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow
I see their antique pen would have expressed
Even such a beauty as you master now
So all their praises are but prophecies
Of this our time all you prefiguring
And for they looked but with divining eyes
They had not skill enough your worth to sing
For we which now behold these present days
Have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise

 CIX
O never say that I was false of heart
Though absence seemed my flame to qualify
As easy might I from myself depart
As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
That is my home of love if I have ranged
Like him that travels I return again
Just to the time not with the time exchanged
So that myself bring water for my stain
Never believe though in my nature reigned
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
That it could so preposterously be stained
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good
For nothing this wide universe I call
Save thou my rose in it thou art my all

 CXVI
Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds
Or bends with the remover to remove
O no it is an everfixed mark
That looks on tempests and is never shaken
It is the star to every wandering bark
Whose worths unknown although his height be taken
Loves not Times fool though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickles compass come
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
But bears it out even to the edge of doom
If this be error and upon me proved
I never writ nor no man ever loved

 CXXX
My mistress eyes are nothing like the sun
Coral is far more red than her lips red
If snow be white why then her breasts are dun
If hairs be wires black wires grow on her head
I have seen roses damasked red and white
But no such roses see I in her cheeks
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
I love to hear her speak  yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound
I grant I never saw a goddess go 
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground
And yet by heaven I think my love as rare
As any she belied with false compare

 CXLVI
Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
Pressed by these rebel powers that thee array
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay
Why so large cost having so short a lease
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
Shall worms inheritors of this excess
Eat up thy charge Is this thy bodys end
Then soul live thou upon thy servants loss
And let that pine to aggravate thy store
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
Within be fed without be rich no more
So shalt thou feed on Death that feeds on men
And Death once dead theres no more dying then

William Shakespeare 15641616


ALEXIS HERE SHE STAYED

Alexis here she stayed among these pines
Sweet hermitress she did alone repair
Here did she spread the treasure of her hair
More rich than that brought from the Colchian mines
She set her by these musked eglantines
The happy place the print seems yet to bear
Her voice did sweeten here thy sugared lines
To which winds trees beasts birds did lend their ear
Me here she first perceived and here a morn
Of bright carnations did oerspread her face
Here did she sigh here first my hopes were born
And I first got a pledge of promised grace
But ah what served it to be happy so
Since passed pleasures double but new woe

William Drummond 15851649


WERE I AS BASE AS IS THE LOWLY PLAIN

Were I as base as is the lowly plain
And you my love as high as heaven above
Yet should the thoughts of me your humble swain
Ascend to heaven in honor of my love
Were I as high as heaven above the plain
And you my love as humble and as low
As are the deepest bottoms of the main
Wheresoeer you were with you my love should go
Were you the earth dear love and I the skies
My love should shine on you like to the sun
And look upon you with ten thousand eyes
Till heaven waxed blind and till the world were done
Wheresoeer I am  below or else above you 
Wheresoeer you are my heart shall truly love you

Joshua Sylvester 15631618


A SONNET OF THE MOON

Look how the pale Queen of the silent night
Doth cause the ocean to attend upon her
And he as long as she is in his sight
With his full tide is ready her to honor
But when the silver wagon of the Moon
Is mounted up so high he cannot follow
The sea calls home his crystal waves to moan
And with low ebb doth manifest his sorrow
So you that are the sovereign of my heart
Have all my joys attending on your will
My joys lowebbing when you do depart
When you return their tide my heart doth fill
So as you come and as you do depart
Joys ebb and flow within my tender heart

Charles Best fl 1602


TO MARY UNWIN

Mary I want a lyre with other strings
Such aid from Heaven as some have feigned they drew
An eloquence scarce given to mortals new
And undebased by praise of meaner things
That ere through age or woe I shed my wings
I may record thy worth with honor due
In verse as musical as thou art true
And that immortalizes whom it sings
But thou hast little need There is a Book
By seraphs writ with beams of heavenly light
On which the eyes of God not rarely look
A chronicle of actions just and bright
There all thy deeds my faithful Mary shine
And since thou ownst that praise I spare thee mine

William Cowper 17311800


WHY ART THOU SILENT

Why art thou silent Is thy love a plant
Of such weak fibre that the treacherous air
Of absence withers what was once so fair
Is there no debt to pay no boon to grant
Yet have my thoughts for thee been vigilant
Bound to thy service with unceasing care 
The minds least generous wish a mendicant
For naught but what thy happiness could spare
Speak  though this soft warm heart once free to hold
A thousand tender pleasures thine and mine
Be left more desolate more dreary cold
Than a forsaken birdsnest filled with snow
Mid its own bush of leafless eglantine 
Speak that my torturing doubts their end may know

William Wordsworth 17701850


SONNETS
From The House of Life

 IV
LOVESIGHT
When do I see thee most beloved one
When in the light the spirits of mine eyes
Before thy face their altar solemnize
The worship of that Love through thee made known
Or when in the dusk hours we two alone
Closekissed and eloquent of still replies
Thy twilighthidden glimmering visage lies
And my soul only sees thy soul its own
O love my love if I no more should see
Thyself nor on the earth the shadow of thee
Nor image of thine eyes in any spring 
How then should sound upon Lifes darkening slope
The groundwhirl of the perished leaves of Hope
The wind of Deaths imperishable wing

 V
HEARTS HOPE
By what words power the key of paths untrod
Shall I the difficult deeps of Love explore
Till parted waves of Song yield up the shore
Even as that sea which Israel crossed dryshod
For lo in some poor rhythmic period
Lady I fain would tell how evermore
Thy soul I know not from thy body nor
Thee from myself neither our love from God
Yea in Gods name and Loves and thine would I
Draw from one loving heart such evidence
As to all hearts all things shall signify
Tender as dawns first lullfire and intense
As instantaneous penetrating sense
In Springs birthhour of other Springs gone by

 XV
THE BIRTHBOND
Have you not noted in some family
Where two were born of a first marriagebed
How still they own their gracious bond though fed
And nursed on the forgotten breast and knee 
How to their fathers children they shall be
In act and thought of one goodwill but each
Shall for the other have in silence speech
And in a word complete community
Even so when first I saw you seemed it love
That among souls allied to mine was yet
One nearer kindred than life hinted of
O born with me somewhere that men forget
And though in years of sight and sound unmet
Known for my souls birthpartner well enough

 XIX
SILENT NOON
Your hands lie open in the long fresh grass 
The fingerpoints look through like rosy blooms
Your eyes smile peace The pasture gleams and glooms
Neath billowing skies that scatter and amass
All round our nest far as the eye can pass
Are golden kingcupfields with silver edge
Where the cowparsley skirts the hawthornhedge
Tis visible silence still as the hourglass
Deep in the sunsearched growths the dragonfly
Hangs like a blue thread loosened from the sky 
So this winged hour is dropped to us from above
Oh clasp we to our hearts for deathless dower
This closecompanioned inarticulate hour
When twofold silence was the song of love

 XXVI
MIDRAPTURE
Thou lovely and beloved thou my love
Whose kiss seems still the first whose summoning eyes
Even now as for our loveworlds new sunrise
Shed very dawn whose voice attuned above
All modulation of the deepbowered dove
Is like a hand laid softly on the soul
Whose hand is like a sweet voice to control
Those worn tired brows it hath the keeping of 
What word can answer to thy word  what gaze
To thine which now absorbs within its sphere
My worshipping face till I am mirrored there
Lightcircled in a heaven of deepdrawn rays
What clasp what kiss mine inmost heart can prove
O lovely and beloved O my love

 XXXI
HER GIFTS
High grace the dower of queens and therewithal
Some woodborn wonders sweet simplicity
A glance like water brimming with the sky
Or hyacinthlight where forestshadows fall
Such thrilling pallor of cheek as doth enthrall
The heart a mouth whose passionate forms imply
All music and all silence held thereby
Deep golden locks her sovereign coronal
A round reared neck meet column of Loves shrine
To cling to when the heart takes sanctuary
Hands which for ever at Loves bidding be
And softstirred feet still answering to his sign 
These are her gifts as tongue may tell them oer
Breathe low her name my soul for that means more

 XXXIV
THE DARK GLASS
Not I myself know all my love for thee
How should I reach so far who cannot weigh
Tomorrows dower by gage of yesterday
Shall birth and death and all dark names that be
As doors and windows bared to some loud sea
Lash deaf mine ears and blind my face with spray
And shall my sense pierce love  the last relay
And ultimate outpost of eternity
Lo what am I to Love the lord of all
One murmuring shell he gathers from the sand 
One little heartflame sheltered in his hand
Yet through thine eyes he grants me clearest call
And veriest touch of powers primordial
That any hourgirt life may understand

 XLIX
WILLOWWOOD
I sat with Love upon a woodside well
Leaning across the water I and he
Nor ever did he speak nor looked at me
But touched his lute wherein was audible
The certain secret thing he had to tell
Only our mirrored eyes met silently
In the low wave and that sound came to be
The passionate voice I knew and my tears fell
And at their fall his eyes beneath grew hers
And with his foot and with his wingfeathers
He swept the spring that watered my hearts drouth
Then the dark ripples spread to waving hair
And as I stooped her own lips rising there
Bubbled with brimming kisses at my mouth

 LXXVIII
BODYS BEAUTY
Or Adams first wife Lilith it is told
The witch he loved before the gift of Eve
That ere the snakes her sweet tongue could deceive
And her enchanted hair was the first gold
And still she sits young while the earth is old
And subtly of herself contemplative
Draws men to watch the bright web she can weave
Till heart and body and life are in its hold
The rose and poppy are her flowers for where
Is he not found O Lilith whom shed scent
And softshed kisses and soft sleep shall snare
Lo as that youths eyes burned at thine so went
Thy spell through him and left his straight neck bent
And round his heart one strangling golden hair

Dante Gabriel Rossetti 18281882


SONNETS

MEETING
They made the chamber sweet with flowers and leaves
And the bed sweet with flowers on which I lay
While my soul lovebound loitered on its way
I did not hear the birds about the eaves
Nor hear the reapers talk among the sheaves
Only my soul kept watch from day to day
My thirsty soul kept watch for one away 
Perhaps he loves I thought remembers grieves
At length there came the step upon the stair
Upon the lock the old familiar hand
Then first my spirit seemed to scent the air
Of Paradise then first the tardy sand
Of time ran golden and I felt my hair
Put on a glory and my soul expand

THE FIRST DAY
I wish I could remember the first day
First hour first moment of your meeting me
If bright or dim the season it might be
Summer or Winter for aught I can say
So unrecorded did it slip away
So blind was I to see and to foresee
So dull to mark the budding of my tree
That would not blossom yet for many a May
If only I could recollect it such
A day of days I let it come and go
As traceless as a thaw of bygone snow
It seemed to mean so little meant so much
If only now I could recall that touch
First touch of hand in hand  Did one but know

REMEMBER
Remember me when I am gone away
Gone far away into the silent land
When you can no more hold me by the hand
Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay
Remember me when no more day by day
You tell me of our future that you planned
Only remember me you understand
It will be late to counsel then or pray
Yet if you should forget me for a while
And afterwards remember do not grieve
For if the darkness and corruption leave
A vestige of the thoughts that once I had
Better by far you should forget and smile
Than that you should remember and be sad

REST
O earth lie heavily upon her eyes
Seal her sweet eyes weary of watching Earth
Lie close around her leave no room for mirth
With its harsh laughter nor for sound of sighs
She hath no questions she hath no replies
Hushed in and curtained with a blessed dearth
Of all that irked her from the hour of birth
With stillness that is almost Paradise
Darkness more clear than noonday holdeth her
Silence more musical than any song
Even her very heart has ceased to stir
Until the morning of Eternity
Her rest shall not begin nor end but be
And when she wakes she will not think it long

Christina Georgina Rossetti 18301894


HOW MY SONGS OF HER BEGAN

God made my lady lovely to behold 
Above the painters dream he set her face
And wrought her body in divinest grace
He touched the brown hair with a sense of gold
And in the perfect form He did enfold
What was alone as perfect the sweet heart
Knowledge most rare to her He did impart
And filled with love and worship all her days
And then God thought Him how it would be well
To give her music and to Love He said
Bring thou some minstrel now that he may tell
How fair and sweet a thing My hands have made
Then at Loves call I came bowed down my head
And at His will my lyre grew audible

Philip Bourke Marston 18501887


AT THE LAST

Because the shadows deepened verily 
Because the end of all seemed near forsooth 
Her gracious spirit ever quick to ruth
Had pity on her bondslave even on me
She came in with the twilight noiselessly
Fair as a rose immaculate as Truth
She leaned above my wrecked and wasted youth
I felt her presence which I could not see
God keep you my poor friend I heard her say
And then she kissed my dry hot lips and eyes
Kiss thou the next kiss quiet Death I pray
Be instant on this hour and so surprise
My spirit while the vision seems to stay
Take thou the heart with the hearts Paradise

Philip Bourke Marston 18501887


TO ONE WHO WOULD MAKE A CONFESSION

On leave the past to bury its own dead
The past is naught to us the present all
What need of last years leaves to strew Loves bed
What need of ghosts to grace a festival
I would not if I could those days recall
Those days not ours For us the feast is spread
The lamps are lit and music plays withal
Then let us love and leave the rest unsaid
This island is our home Around it roar
Great gulfs and oceans channels straits and seas
What matter in what wreck we reached the shore
So we both reached it We can mock at these
Oh leave the past if past indeed there be
I would not know it I would know but thee

Wilfrid Scawen Blunt 18401922


THE PLEASURES OF LOVE

I do not care for kisses Tis a debt
We paid for the first privilege of love
These are the rains of April which have wet
Our fallow hearts and forced their germs to move
Now the green corn has sprouted Each new day
Brings better pleasures a more dear surprise
The blade the ear the harvest  and our way
Leads through a region wealthy grown and wise
We now compare our fortunes Each his store
Displays to kindred eyes of garnered grain
Two happy farmers learned in loves lore
Who weigh and touch and argue and complain 
Dear endless argument Yet sometimes we
Even as we argue kiss There Let it be

Wilfrid Scawen Blunt 18401922


WERE BUT MY SPIRIT LOOSED UPON THE AIR

Were but my spirit loosed upon the air 
By some High Power who could Lifes chains unbind
Set free to seek what most it longs to find 
To no proud Court of Kings would I repair
I would but climb once more a narrow stair
When day was wearing late and dusk was kind
And one should greet me to my failings blind
Content so I but shared his twilight there
Nay well I know he waits not as of old 
I could not find him in the oldtime place 
I must pursue him made by sorrow bold
Through worlds unknown in strange celestial race
Whose mystic round no traveller has told
From star to star until I see his face

Louise Chandler Moulton 18351908


RENOUNCEMENT

I must not think of thee and tired yet strong
I shun the thought that lurks in all delight 
The thought of thee  and in the blue heavens height
And in the dearest passage of a song
Oh just beyond the fairest thoughts that throng
This breast the thought of thee waits hidden yet bright
But it must never never come in sight
I must stop short of thee the whole day long
But when sleep comes to close each difficult day
When night gives pause to the long watch I keep
And all my bonds I needs must loose apart
Must doff my will as raiment laid away 
With the first dream that comes with the first sleep
I run I run I am gathered to thy heart

Alice Meynell 18501922


MY LOVE FOR THEE

My love for thee doth march like armed men
Against a queenly city they would take
Along the armys front its banners shake
Across the mountain and the sunsmit plain
It steadfast sweeps as sweeps the steadfast rain
And now the trumpet makes the still air quake
And now the thundering cannon doth awake
Echo on echo echoing loud again
But lo the conquest higher than bard eer sung
Instead of answering cannon proud surrender
Joyful the iron gates are open flung
And for the conqueror welcome gay and tender
O bright the invaders path with tribute flowers
While comrade flags flame forth on wall and towers

Richard Watson Gilder 18441909


SONNETS

AFTER THE ITALIAN

I know not if I love her overmuch
But this I know that when unto her face
She lifts her hand which rests there still a space
Then slowly falls  tis I who feel that touch
And when she sudden shakes her head with such
A look I soon her secret meaning trace
So when she runs I think tis I who race
Like a poor cripple who has lost his crutch
I am if she is gone and when she goes
I know not why for that is a strange art 
As if myself should from myself depart
I know not if I love her more than those
Who long her light have known but for the rose
She covers in her hair Id give my heart

I like her gentle hand that sometimes strays
To find the place through the same book with mine
I like her feet and O those eyes divine
And when we say farewell perhaps she stays
Lovelingering  then hurries on her ways
As if she thought To end my pain and thine
I like her voice better than newmade wine
I like the mandolin whereon she plays
And I like too the cloak I saw her wear
And the red scarf that her white neck doth cover
And well I like the door that she comes through
I like the ribbon that doth bind her hair 
But then in truth I am that ladys lover
And every new day there is something new

Richard Watson Gilder 18441909


STANZAS
From Modern Love

 I
By this he knew she wept with waking eyes
That at his hands light quiver by her head
The strange low sobs that shook their common bed
Were called into her with a sharp surprise
And strangled mute like little gaping snakes
Dreadfully venomous to him She lay
Stonestill and the long darkness flowed away
With muffled pulses Then as midnight makes
Her giant heart of Memory and Tears
Drink the pale drug of silence and so beat
Sleeps heavy measure they from head to feet
Were moveless looking through their dead black years
By vain regret scrawled over the blank wall
Like sculptured effigies they might be seen
Upon their marriagetomb the sword between
Each wishing for the sword that severs all

 II
It ended and the morrow brought the task
Her eyes were guilty gates that let him in
By shutting all too zealous for their sin
Each sucked a secret and each wore a mask
But oh the bitter taste her beauty had
He sickened as at breath of poisonflowers
A languid humor stole among the hours
And if their smiles encountered he went mad
And raged deep inward till the light was brown
Before his vision and the world forgot
Looked wicked as some old dull murderspot
A star with lurid beams she seemed to crown
The pit of infamy and then again
He fainted on his vengefulness and strove
To ape the magnanimity of love
And smote himself a shuddering heap of pain

 III
This was the woman what now of the man
But pass him If he comes beneath a heel
He shall be crushed until he cannot feel
Or being callous haply till he can
But he is nothing  nothing Only mark
The rich light striking out from her on him
Ha what a sense it is when her eyes swim
Across the man she singles leaving dark
All else Lord God who madst the thing so fair
See that I am drawn to her even now
It cannot be such harm on her cool brow
To plant a kiss Yet if I meet him there
But she is mine Ah no I know too well
I claim a star whose light is overcast
I claim a phantomwoman in the Past
The hour has struck though I heard not the bell

 XIV
What soul would bargain for a cure that brings
Contempt the nobler agony to kill
Rather let me bear on the bitter ill
And strike this rusty bosom with new stings
It seems there is another veering fit
Since on a goldhaired ladys eyeballs pure
I looked with little prospect of a cure
The while her mouths red bow loosed shafts of wit
Just heaven can it be true that jealousy
Has decked the woman thus and does her head
Swim somewhat for possessions forfeited
Madam you teach me many things that be
I open an old book and there I find
That Women still may love whom they deceive
Such love I prize not madam by your leave
The game you play at is not to my mind

 XVI
In our old shipwrecked days there was an hour
When in the firelight steadily aglow
Joined slackly we beheld the red chasm grow
Among the clicking coals Our librarybower
That eve was left to us and hushed we sat
As lovers to whom Time is whispering
From suddenopened doors we heard them sing
The nodding elders mixed good wine with chat
Well knew we that Lifes greatest treasure lay
With us and of it was our talk Ah yes
Love dies I said I never thought it less
She yearned to me that sentence to unsay
Then when the fire domed blackening I found
Her cheek was salt against my kiss and swift
Up the sharp scale of sobs her breast did lift 
Now am I haunted by that taste that sound

 XXVI
Love ere he bleeds an eagle in high skies
Has earth beneath his wings from reddened eve
He views the rosy dawn In vain they weave
The fatal web below while far he flies
But when the arrow strikes him theres a change
He moves but in the track of his spent pain
Whose red drops are the links of a harsh chain
Binding him to the ground with narrow range
A subtle serpent then has Love become
I had the eagle in my bosom erst
Henceforward with the serpent I am cursed
I can interpret where the mouth is dumb
Speak and I see the sidelie of a truth
Perchance my heart may pardon you this deed
But be no coward  you that made Love bleed
You must bear all the venom of his tooth

 XLI
How many a thing which we cast to the ground
When others pick it up becomes a gem
We grasp at all the wealth it is to them
And by reflected light its worth is found
Yet for us still tis nothing and that zeal
Of false appreciation quickly fades
This truth is little known to human shades
How rare from their own instinct tis to feel
They waste the soul with spurious desire
That is not the ripe flame upon the bough
We two have taken up a lifeless vow
To rob a living passion dust for fire
Madam is grave and eyes the clock that tells
Approaching midnight We have struck despair
Into two hearts O look we like a pair
Who for fresh nuptials joyfully yield all else

 XLIII
Mark where the pressing wind shoots javelinlike
Its skeleton shadow on the broadbacked wave
Here is a fitting spot to dig Loves grave
Here where the ponderous breakers plunge and strike
And dart their hissing tongues high up the sand
In hearing of the ocean and in sight
Of those ribbed windstreaks running into white
If I the death of Love had deeply planned
I never could have made it half so sure
As by the unblest kisses which upbraid
The fullwaked sense or failing that degrade
Tis morning but no morning can restore
What we have forfeited I see no sin
The wrong is mixed In tragic life God wot
No villain need be Passions spin the plot
We are betrayed by what is false within

 XLIX
He found her by the oceans moaning verge
Nor any wicked change in her discerned
And she believed his old love had returned
Which was her exultation and her scourge
She took his hand and walked with him and seemed
The wife he sought though shadowlike and dry
She had one terror lest her heart should sigh
And tell her loudly she no longer dreamed
She dared not say This is my breast look in
But theres a strength to help the desperate weak
That night he learned how silence best can speak
The awful things when Pity pleads for Sin
About the middle of the night her call
Was heard and he came wondering to the bed
Now kiss me dear it may be now she said
Lethe had passed those lips and he knew all

 L
Thus piteously Love closed what he begat
The union of this everdiverse pair
These two were rapid falcons in a snare
Condemned to do the flitting of the bat
Lovers beneath the singing sky of May
They wandered once clear as the dew on flowers
But they fed not on the advancing hours
Their hearts held cravings for the buried day
Then each applied to each that fatal knife
Deep questioning which probes to endless dole
Ah what a dusty answer gets the soul
When hot for certainties in this our life 
In tragic hints here see what evermore
Moves dark as yonder midnight oceans force
Thundering like ramping hosts of warrior horse
To throw that faint thin line upon the shore

George Meredith 18281909


LOVE IN THE WINDS

When I am standing on a mountain crest
Or hold the tiller in the dashing spray
My love of you leaps foaming in my breast
Shouts with the winds and sweeps to their foray
My heart bounds with the horses of the sea
And plunges in the wild ride of the night
Flaunts in the teeth of tempest the large glee
That rides out Fate and welcomes gods to fight
Ho love I laugh aloud for love of you
Glad that our love is fellow to rough weather 
No fretful orchid hothoused from the dew
But hale and hardy as the highland heather
Rejoicing in the wind that stings and thrills
Comrade of ocean playmate of the hills

Richard Hovey 18641900


OH DEATH WILL FIND ME

Oh Death will find me long before I tire
Of watching you and swing me suddenly
Into the shade and loneliness and mire
Of the last land There waiting patiently
One day I think Ill feel a cool wind blowing
See a slow light across the Stygian tide
And hear the Dead about me stir unknowing
And tremble And I shall know that you have died
And watch you a broadbrowed and smiling dream
Pass light as ever through the lightless host
Quietly ponder start and sway and gleam 
Most individual and bewildering ghost 
And turn and toss your brown delightful head
Amusedly among the ancient Dead

Rupert Brooke 18871915


THE BUSY HEART

Now that weve done our best and worst and parted
I would fill my mind with thoughts that will not rend
O heart I do not dare go emptyhearted
Ill think of Love in books Love without end
Women with child content and old men sleeping
And wet strong ploughlands scarred for certain grain
And babes that weep and so forget their weeping
And the young heavens forgetful after rain
And evening hush broken by homing wings
And Songs nobility and Wisdom holy
That live we dead I would think of a thousand things
Lovely and durable and taste them slowly
One after one like tasting a sweet food
I have need to busy my heart with quietude

Rupert Brooke 18871915


THE HILL

Breathless we flung us on the windy hill
Laughed in the sun and kissed the lovely grass
You said Through glory and ecstasy we pass
Wind sun and earth remain the birds sing still
When we are old are old    And when we die
Alls over that is ours and life burns on
Through other lovers other lips said I
 Heart of my heart our heaven is now is won
We are Earths best that learnt her lesson here
Life is our cry We have kept the faith we said
We shall go down with unreluctant tread
Rosecrowned into the darkness    Proud we were
And laughed that had such brave true things to say
 And then you suddenly cried and turned away

Rupert Brooke 18871915


SONNETS
From Sonnets to Miranda

Daughter of her whose face and lofty name
Prenuptial of old States and Cities speak
Where lands of wine look north to peak on peak
Of the overwatching Alps through her you claim
Kinship with vanished Power unvanished Fame
And midst a world grown colorless and bleak
I see the blood of Doges in your cheek
And in your hair the Titian tints of flame
Daughter of England too you first drew breath
Where our coy Springs to our coy Summers yield
And you descend from one whose lance and shield
Were with the grandsire of Elizabeth
When the Plantagenet saw the avenger Death
Toward him spurring over Bosworth field

 II
If you had lived in that more stately time
When men remembered the great Tudor queen
To noblest verse your name had wedded been
And you for ever crowned with golden rhyme
If mid Lorenzos Florence made sublime
By Arts ReBirth you had moved a Muse serene
The mightiest limners had revealed your mien
To all the ages and each wondering clime
Fled are the singers that from language drew
Its virgin secrets and in narrow space
The mightiest limners sleep and only He
The Eternal Artist still creates anew
That which is fairer than all song  the grace
That takes the world into captivity

 III
I dare but sing of you in such a strain
As may beseem the wandering harpers tongue
Who of the glory of his Queen hath sung
Outside her castle gates in wind and rain
She seated mid the noblest of her train
In her great halls with pictured arras hung
Hardly can know what melody hath rung
Through the forgetting night and rung in vain
He with one word from her to whom he brings
The loyal heart that she alone can sway
Would be made rich for ever but he sings
Of queenhood too aloof too great to say
Sing on sing on O minstrel  though he flings
His soul to the winds that whirl his songs away

 V
I cast these lyric offerings at your feet
And ask you but to fling them not away
There suffer them to rest till even they
By happy nearness to yourself grow sweet
He that hath shaped and wrought them holds it meet
That you be sung not in some artless way
But with such pomp and ritual as when May
Sends her full choir the throned Morn to greet
With something caught from your own lofty air
With something learned from your own highborn grace
Song must approach your presence must forbear
All light and easy accost and yet abase
Its own proud spirit in awe and reverence there
Before the Wonder of your form and face

 VI
I move amid your throng I watch you hold
Converse with many who are noble and fair
Yourself the noblest and the fairest there
Reigning supreme crowned with that living gold
I talk with men whose names have been enrolled
In Englands book of honor and I share
With these one honor  your regard and wear
Your friendship as a jewel of worth untold
And then I go from out your sphered light
Into a world which still seems full of You
I know the stars are yonder that possess
Their ancient seats heedless what mortals do
But I behold in all the range of Night
Only the splendor of your loveliness

 VIII
If I had never known your face at all
Had only heard you speak beyond thick screen
Of leaves in an old garden when the sheen
Of morning dwelt on dial and ivied wall
I think your voice had been enough to call
Yourself before me in living vision seen
So pregnant with your Essence had it been
So charged with You in each soft rise and fall
At least I know that when upon the night
With chanted word your voice lets loose your soul
I am pierced I am pierced and cloven with Delight
That hath all Pain within it and the whole
Worlds tears all ecstasy of inward sight
And the blind cry of all the seas that roll

William Watson 18581935


SONNETS
From Thysia

 II
Twin songs there are of joyance or of pain
One of the morning lark in midmost sky
When falls to earth a mist a silver rain
A glittering cascade of melody
And mead and wold and the wide heaven rejoice
And praise the Maker but alone I kneel
In sorrowing prayer Then wanes the day a voice
Trembles along the dusk till peal on peal
It pierces every living heart that hears
Pierces and burns and purifies like fire
Again I kneel under the starry spheres
And all my soul seems healed and lifted higher
Nor could that jubilant song of day prevail
Like thine of tender grief O nightingale

 III
Bow down my song before her presence high
In that far world where you must seek her now
Say that you bring to her no sonnetry
But plainset anguish of the breast or brow
Say that on earth I sang to her alone
But now while in her heaven she sits divine
Turning I tell the world my bitter moan
Bidding it share its hopes and griefs with mine
Versing not what I would but what I must
Wail of the wind or sobbing of the wave
Ah say you raised my bowed head from the dust
And held me backward from a willful grave
Say this and her sweet pity will approve
And bind yet closer her dead bond of love

 VII
I watch beside you in your silent room
Without the chill rain falls life dies away
The dead leaves drip and the fastgathering gloom
Closes around this brief November day
First day of holy death of sacred rest
I kiss your brow calm beautiful and cold
I lay my yearning arms across your breast
I claim our darling rapture as of old
Dear heart I linger but a little space
Sweet wife I come to your new world ere long
This lily  keep it till our next embrace
While the mute Angel makes our love more strong
While here I cling in lifes short agony
To God and to your deathless memory

 XVI
Comes the New Year wailing the north winds blow
In her cold lonely grave my dead love lies
Dead lies the stiffened earth beneath the snow
And blinding sleet blots out the desolate skies
I stand between the living and the dead
Hateful to me is life hateful is death
Her life was sad and on that narrow bed
She will not turn nor wake with human breath
I kneel between the evil and the good
The struggle oer this one sweet faith have I 
Though life and death be dimly understood
She loved me I loved her love cannot die
Go then thy way with thine accustomed cheer
Nor heed my churlish greeting O New Year

 XXIII
Like some lone miser dear behold me stand
To count my treasures and their worth extol 
A last word penciled by that poor left hand
Two kindred names on the same gentle scroll
I found it near your pillow traced below
This little scarf you made our latest pride
The violet I digged so long ago
That nestled in your bosom till you died
But dearest to my heart whereon it lies
Is one warm tress of your luxuriant hair
Still present to my touch my lips my eyes
Forever changeless and forever fair
And even in your grave beauteous and free
From the cold grasp of mutability

 XXXVI
So sang I in the springtime of my years 
Theres nothing we can call our own but love
So let me murmur now that winter nears
And even in death the deathless truth approve
Oft have I seen the slow the broadening river
Roll its glad waters to the parent sea
Death is the call of love to love the giver
Claims his own gift for some new mystery
In boundless love divine the heavens are spread
In wedded love is earths divinest store
And he that liveth to himself is dead
And he that lives for love lives evermore
Only in love can lifes true path be trod
Love is selfgiving therefore love is God

 XXXVII
Hear O SelfGiver infinite as good
This faith at least my wavering heart should hold
Nor find in dark regret its daily food
But catch the gleam of glories yet untold
Yea even on earth beloved as love well knew
Brief absence brought our fond returning kiss
So let my soul to Gods great world and you
Look onward with sweet pain of secret bliss 
O sunset sky and lonely gleaming star
Your beauty thrills me from the bound of space
O Love thy loveliness shows best afar
And only Heaven shall give thee perfect grace
Grant then dear Lord that all who love may be
Heirs of Thy glorious Immortality

 XLV
How shall I tell the measure of my love
Tis vain that I have given thee vows and tears
Or striven in verse my tenderness to prove
Or held thy hand in journeyings through the years
Vain that I follow now with hastening feet
And sing thy death still murmuring in my song
Only for thee I would the strain were sweet
Only for thee I would the words were strong
Vain even that I closed with death and fought
To hold thee longer in a world so dear
Vain that I count a weary world as naught
That I would die to bring thee back I hear
God answer me from heaven O angel wife 
To prove thy love live thou a nobler life

Morton Luce 1849


SONNETS
From Sonnets from the Portuguese

 I
I thought once how Theocritus had sung
Of the sweet years the dear and wishedfor years
Who each one in a gracious hand appears
To bear a gift for mortals old or young
And as I mused it in his antique tongue
I saw in gradual vision through my tears
The sweet sad years the melancholy years
Those of my own life who by turns had flung
A shadow across me Straightway I was ware
So weeping how a mystic Shape did move
Behind me and drew me backward by the hair
And a voice said in mastery while I strove 
Guess now who holds thee  Death I said But there
The silver answer rang  Not Death but Love

 III
Unlike are we unlike O princely Heart
Unlike our uses and our destinies
Our ministering two angels look surprise
On one another as they strike athwart
Their wings in passing Thou bethink thee art
A guest for queens to social pageantries
With gages from a hundred brighter eyes
Than tears even can make mine to play thy part
Of chief musician What hast thou to do
With looking from the latticelights at me
A poor tired wandering singer singing through
The dark and leaning up a cypress tree
The chrism is on thine head  on mine the dew 
And Death must dig the level where these agree

 VI
Go from me Yet I feel that I shall stand
Henceforward in thy shadow Nevermore
Alone upon the threshold of my door
Of individual life I shall command
The uses of my soul nor lift my hand
Serenely in the sunshine as before
Without the sense of that which I forbore 
Thy touch upon the palm The widest land
Doom takes to part us leaves thy heart in mine
With pulses that beat double What I do
And what I dream include thee as the wine
Must taste of its own grapes And when I sue
God for myself He hears that name of thine
And sees within my eyes the tears of two

 VII
The face of all the world is changed I think
Since first I heard the footsteps of thy soul
Move still oh still beside me as they stole
Betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink
Of obvious death where I who thought to sink
Was caught up into love and taught the whole
Of life in a new rhythm The cup of dole
God gave for baptism I am fain to drink
And praise its sweetness Sweet with thee anear
The name of country heaven are changed away
For where thou art or shalt be there or here
And this    this lute and song    loved yesterday
The singing angels know are only dear
Because thy name moves right in what they say

 VIII
What can I give thee back O liberal
And princely giver who hast brought the gold
And purple of thine heart unstained untold
And laid them on the outside of the wall
For such as I to take or leave withal
In unexpected largess Am I cold
Ungrateful that for these most manifold
High gifts I render nothing back at all
Not so not cold  but very poor instead
Ask God who knows For frequent tears have run
The colors from my life and left so dead
And pale a stuff it were not fitly done
To give the same as pillow to thy head
Go farther let it serve to trample on

 IX
Can it be right to give what I can give
To let thee sit beneath the fall of tears
As salt as mine and hear the sighing years
Resighing on my lips renunciative
Through those infrequent smiles which fail to live
For all thy adjurations O my fears
That this can scarce be right We are not peers
So to be lovers and I own and grieve
That givers of such gifts as mine are must
Be counted with the ungenerous Out alas
I will not soil thy purple with my dust
Nor breathe my poison on thy Veniceglass
Nor give thee any love  which were unjust
Beloved I only love thee let it pass

 X
Yet love mere love is beautiful indeed
And worthy of acceptation Fire is bright
Let temple burn or flax an equal light
Leaps in the flame from cedarplank or weed
And love is fire And when I say at need
I love thee    mark    I love thee  in thy sight
I stand transfigured glorified aright
With conscience of the new rays that proceed
Out of my face toward thine Theres nothing low
In love when love the lowest meanest creatures
Who love God God accepts while loving so
And what I feel across the inferior features
Of what I am doth flash itself and show
How that great work of Love enhances Natures

 XII
Indeed this very love which is my boast
And which when rising up from breast to brow
Doth crown me with a ruby large enow
To draw mens eyes and prove the inner cost 
This love even all my worth to the uttermost
I should not love withal unless that thou
Hadst set me an example shown me how
When first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed
And love called love And thus I cannot speak
Of love even as a good thing of my own
Thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak
And placed it by thee on a golden throne 
And that I love O soul we must be meek
Is by thee only whom I love alone

 XIV
If thou must love me let it be for naught
Except for loves sake only Do not say
I love her for her smile  her look  her way
Of speaking gently  for a trick of thought
That falls in well with mine and certes brought
A sense of pleasant ease on such a day 
For these things in themselves Beloved may
Be changed or change for thee  and love so wrought
May be unwrought so Neither love me for
Thine own dear pitys wiping my cheeks dry 
A creature might forget to weep who bore
Thy comfort long and lose thy love thereby
But love me for loves sake that evermore
Thou mayst love on through loves eternity

 XVII
My poet thou canst touch on all the notes
God set between His After and Before
And strike up and strike off the general roar
Of the rushing worlds a melody that floats
In a serene air purely Antidotes
Of medicated music answering for
Mankinds forlornest uses thou canst pour
From thence into their ears Gods will devotes
Thine to such ends and mine to wait on thine
How Dearest wilt thou have me for most use
A hope to sing by gladly or a fine
Sad memory with thy songs to interfuse
A shade in which to sing  of palm or pine
A grave on which to rest from singing Choose

 XVIII
I never gave a lock of hair away
To a man Dearest except this to thee
Which now upon my fingers thoughtfully
I ring out to the full brown length and say
Take it My day of youth went yesterday
My hair no longer bounds to my foots glee
Nor plant I it from rose or myrtletree
As girls do any more it only may
Now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears
Taught drooping from the head that hangs aside
Through sorrows trick I thought the funeralshears
Would take this first but Love is justified 
Take it thou  finding pure from all those years
The kiss my mother left here when she died

 XXI
Say over again and yet once over again
That thou dost love me Though the word repeated
Should seem a cuckoosong as thou dost treat it
Remember never to the hill or plain
Valley and wood without her cuckoostrain
Comes the fresh Spring in all her green completed
Beloved I amid the darkness greeted
By a doubtful spiritvoice in that doubts pain
Cry Speak once more  thou lovest Who can fear
Too many stars though each in heaven shall roll
Too many flowers though each shall crown the year
Say thou dost love me love me love me  toll
The silver iterance  only minding Dear
To love me also in silence with thy soul

 XXII
When our two souls stand up erect and strong
Face to face silent drawing nigh and nigher
Until the lengthening wings break into fire
At either curved point  what bitter wrong
Can the earth do us that we should not long
Be here contented Think In mounting higher
The angels would press on us and aspire
To drop some golden orb of perfect song
Into our deep dear silence Let us stay
Rather on earth Beloved  where the unfit
Contrarious moods of men recoil away
And isolate pure spirits and permit
A place to stand and love in for a day
With darkness and the deathhour rounding it

 XXVIII
My letters all dead paper mute and white
And yet they seem alive and quivering
Against my tremulous hands which loose the string
And let them drop down on my knee tonight
This said  he wished to have me in his sight
Once as a friend this fixed a day in spring
To come and touch my hand    a simple thing
Yet I wept for it  this    the papers light   
Said Dear I love thee and I sank and quailed
As if Gods future thundered on my past
This said I am thine  and so its ink has paled
With lying at my heart that beat too fast
And this    O Love thy words have ill availed
If what this said I dared repeat at last

 XXXVIII
First time he kissed me he but only kissed
The fingers of this hand wherewith I write
And ever since it grew more clean and white
Slow to worldgreetings quick with its Oh list
When the angels speak A ring of amethyst
I could not wear here plainer to my sight
Than that first kiss The second passed in height
The first and sought the forehead and half missed
Half falling on the hair O beyond meed
That was the chrism of love which loves own crown
With sanctifying sweetness did precede
The third upon my lips was folded down
In perfect purple state since when indeed
I have been proud and said My love my own

 XLIII
How do I love thee Let me count the ways
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace
I love thee to the level of everydays
Most quiet need by sun and candlelight
I love thee freely as men strive for Right
I love thee purely as they turn from Praise
I love thee with the passion put to use
In my old griefs and with my childhoods faith
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints  I love thee with the breath
Smiles tears of all my life  and if God choose
I shall but love thee better after death

Elizabeth Barrett Browning 18061861


ONE WORD MORE
TO E B B

 I
There they are my fifty men and women
Naming me the fifty poems finished
Take them Love the book and me together
Where the heart lies let the brain lie also

 II
Rafael made a century of sonnets
Made and wrote them in a certain volume
Dinted with the silverpointed pencil
Else he only used to draw Madonnas
These the world might view  but one the volume
Who that one you ask Your heart instructs you
Did she live and love it all her lifetime
Did she drop his lady of the sonnets
Die and let it drop beside her pillow
Where it lay in place of Rafaels glory
Rafaels cheek so duteous and so loving 
Cheek the world was wont to hail a painters
Rafaels cheek her love had turned a poets

 III
You and I would rather read that volume
Taken to his beating bosom by it
Lean and list the bosombeats of Rafael
Would we not than wonder at Madonnas 
Her San Sisto names and Her Foligno
Her that visits Florence in a vision
Her thats left with lilies in the Louvre 
Seen by us and all the world in circle

 IV
You and I will never read that volume
Guido Reni like his own eyes apple
Guarded long the treasurebook and loved it
Guido Reni dying all Bologna
Cried and the world cried too Ours the treasure
Suddenly as rare things will it vanished

 V
Dante once prepared to paint an angel
Whom to please You whisper Beatrice
While he mused and traced it and retraced it
Peradventure with a pen corroded
Still by drops of that hot ink he dipped for
When his left hand i the hair o the wicked
Back he held the brow and pricked its stigma
Bit into the live mans flesh for parchment
Loosed him laughed to see the writing rankle
Let the wretch go festering through Florence 
Dante who loved well because he hated
Hated wickedness that hinders loving
Dante standing studying his angel 
In there broke the folk of his Inferno
Says he  Certain people of importance
Such he gave his daily dreadful line to
Entered and would seize forsooth the poet
Says the poet  Then I stopped my painting

 VI
You and I would rather see that angel
Painted by the tenderness of Dante
Would we not  than read a fresh Inferno

 VII
You and I will never see that picture
While he mused on love and Beatrice
While he softened oer his outlined angel
In they broke those people of importance
We and Bice bear the loss forever

 VIII
What of Rafaels sonnets Dantes picture
This no artist lives and loves that longs not
Once and only once and for one only
Ah the prize to find his love a language
Fit and fair and simple and sufficient 
Using nature thats an art to others
Not this one time art thats turned his nature
Ay of all the artists living loving
None but would forego his proper dowry 
Does he paint he fain would write a poem 
Does he write he fain would paint a picture
Put to proof art alien to the artists
Once and only once and for one only
So to be the man and leave the artist
Gain the mans joy miss the artists sorrow

 IX
Wherefore Heavens gift takes earths abatement
He who smites the rock and spreads the water
Bidding drink and live a crowd beneath him
Even he the minute makes immortal
Proves perchance but mortal in the minute
Desecrates belike the deed in doing
While he smites how can he but remember
So he smote before in such a peril
When they stood and mocked  Shall smiting help us
When they drank and sneered  A stroke is easy
When they wiped their mouths and went their journey
Throwing him for thanks  But drought was pleasant
Thus old memories mar the actual triumph
Thus the doing savors of disrelish
Thus achievement lacks a gracious somewhat
Oerimportuned brows becloud the mandate
Carelessness or consciousness  the gesture
For he bears an ancient wrong about him
Sees and knows again those phalanxed faces
Hears yet one time more the customed prelude 
How shouldst thou of all men smite and save us
Guesses what is like to prove the sequel 
Egypts fleshpots  nay the drought was better

 X
Oh the crowd must have emphatic warrant
Theirs the Sinaiforeheads cloven brilliance
Rightarms rodsweep tongues imperial fiat
Never dares the man put off the prophet

 XI
Did he love one face from out the thousands
Were she Jethros daughter white and wifely
Were she but the Aethiopian bondslave
He would envy yon dumb patient camel
Keeping a reserve of scanty water
Meant to save his own life in the desert
Ready in the desert to deliver
Kneeling down to let his breast be opened
Hoard and life together for his mistress

 XII
I shall never in the years remaining
Paint you pictures no nor carve you statues
Make you music that should allexpress me
So it seems I stand on my attainment
This of verse alone one life allows me
Verse and nothing else have I to give you
Other heights in other lives God willing
All the gifts from all the heights your own Love

 XIII
Yet a semblance of resource avails us 
Shade so finely touched loves sense must seize it
Take these lines look lovingly and nearly
Lines I write the first time and the last time
He who works in fresco steals a hairbrush
Curbs the liberal hand subservient proudly
Cramps his spirit crowds its all in little
Makes a strange art of an art familiar
Fills his ladys missalmarge with flowerets
He who blows through bronze may breathe through silver
Fitly serenade a slumbrous princess
He who writes may write for once as I do

 XIV
Love you saw me gather men and women
Live or dead or fashioned by my fancy
Enter each and all and use their service
Speak from every mouth  the speech a poem
Hardly shall I tell my joys and sorrows
Hopes and fears belief and disbelieving
I am mine and yours  the rest be all mens
Karshish Cleon Norbert and the fifty
Let me speak this once in my true person
Not as Lippo Roland or Andrea
Though the fruit of speech be just this sentence
Pray you lock on these my men and women
Take and keep my fifty poems finished
Where my heart lies let my brain lie also
Poor the speech be how I speak for all things

 XV
Not but that you know me Lo the moons self
Here in London yonder late in Florence
Still we find her face the thricetransfigured
Curving on a sky imbrued with color
Drifted over Fiesole by twilight
Came she our new crescent of a hairsbreadth
Full she flared it lamping Samminiato
Rounder twixt the cypresses and rounder
Perfect till the nightingales applauded
Now a piece of her old self impoverished
Hard to greet she traverses the houseroofs
Hurries with unhandsome thrift of silver
Goes dispiritedly glad to finish

 XVI
What theres nothing in the moon noteworthy
Nay for if that moon could love a mortal
Use to charm him so to fit a fancy
All her magic tis the old sweet mythos
She would turn a new side to her mortal
Side unseen of herdsman huntsman steersman 
Blank to Zoroaster on his terrace
Blind to Galileo on his turret
Dumb to Homer dumb to Keats  him even
Think the wonder of the moonstruck mortal 
When she turns round comes again in heaven
Opens out anew for worse or better
Proves she like some portent of an iceberg
Swimming full upon the ship it founders
Hungry with huge teeth of splintered crystals
Proves she as the paved work of a sapphire
Seen by Moses when he climbed the mountain
Moses Aaron Nadab and Abihu
Climbed and saw the very God the Highest
Stand upon the paved work of a sapphire
Like the bodied heaven in his clearness
Shone the stone the sapphire of that paved work
When they ate and drank and saw God also

 XVII
What were seen None knows none ever shall know
Only this is sure  the sight were other
Not the moons same side born late in Florence
Dying now impoverished here in London
God be thanked the meanest of his creatures
Boasts two soulsides one to face the world with
One to show a woman when he loves her

 XVIII
This I say of me but think of you Love
This to you  yourself my moon of poets
Ah but thats the worlds side theres the wonder
Thus they see you praise you think they know you
There in turn I stand with them and praise you 
Out of my own self I dare to phrase it
But the best is when I glide from out them
Cross a step or two of dubious twilight
Come out on the other side the novel
Silent silver lights and darks undreamed of
Where I hush and bless myself with silence

 XIX
Oh their Rafael of the dear Madonnas
Oh their Dante of the dread Inferno
Wrote one song  and in my brain I sing it
Drew one angel  borne see on my bosom

Robert Browning 18121889
