THE ROSE OF TUOLUMNE


CHAPTER I


It was nearly two oclock in the morning The lights were out in
Robinsons Hall where there had been dancing and revelry and the moon
riding high painted the black windows with silver The cavalcade that
an hour ago had shocked the sedate pines with song and laughter were
all dispersed One enamoured swain had ridden east another west
another north another south and the object of their adoration left
within her bower at Chemisal Ridge was calmly going to bed

I regret that I am not able to indicate the exact stage of that process
Two chairs were already filled with delicate inwrappings and white
confusion and the young lady herself halfhidden in the silky threads
of her yellow hair had at one time borne a faint resemblance to a
partlyhusked ear of Indian corn But she was now clothed in that
one long formless garment that makes all women equal and the round
shoulders and neat waist that an hour ago had been so fatal to the
peace of mind of Four Forks had utterly disappeared The face above
it was very pretty the foot below albeit shapely was not small The
flowers as a general thing dont raise their heads MUCH to look after
me she had said with superb frankness to one of her lovers

The expression of the Rose tonight was contentedly placid She walked
slowly to the window and making the smallest possible peephole through
the curtain looked out The motionless figure of a horseman still
lingered on the road with an excess of devotion that only a coquette
or a woman very much in love could tolerate The Rose at that
moment was neither and after a reasonable pause turned away saying
quite audibly that it was too ridiculous for any thing As she came
back to her dressingtable it was noticeable that she walked steadily
and erect without that slight affectation of lameness common to people
with whom bare feet are only an episode Indeed it was only four years
ago that without shoes or stockings a longlimbed colty girl in a
waistless calico gown she had leaped from the tailboard of her fathers
emigrantwagon when it first drew up at Chemisal Ridge Certain wild
habits of the Rose had outlived transplanting and cultivation

A knock at the door surprised her In another moment she had leaped into
bed and with darklyfrowning eyes from its secure recesses demanded
Whos there

An apologetic murmur on the other side of the door was the response

Why fatheris that you

There were further murmurs affirmative deprecatory and persistent

Wait said the Rose She got up unlocked the door leaped nimbly
into bed again and said Come

The door opened timidly The broad stooping shoulders and grizzled
head of a man past the middle age appeared after a moments
hesitation a pair of large diffident feet shod with canvas slippers
concluded to follow When the apparition was complete it closed the
door softly and stood therea very shy ghost indeedwith apparently
more than the usual spiritual indisposition to begin a conversation
The Rose resented this impatiently though I fear not altogether
intelligibly

Do father I declare

You was abed Jinny said Mr McClosky slowly glancing with a
singular mixture of masculine awe and paternal pride upon the two
chairs and their contentsyou was abed and ondressed

I was

Surely said Mr McClosky seating himself on the extreme edge of the
bed and painfully tucking his feet away under itsurely After
a pause he rubbed a short thick stumpy beard that bore a general
resemblance to a badlyworn blackingbrush with the palm of his hand
and went on You had a good time Jinny

Yes father

They was all there

Yes Rance and York and Ryder and Jack

And Jack Mr McClosky endeavored to throw an expression of arch
inquiry into his small tremulous eyes but meeting the unabashed
widelyopened lid of his daughter he winked rapidly and blushed to the
roots of his hair

Yes Jack was there said Jenny without change of color or the least
selfconsciousness in her great gray eyes and he came home with me
She paused a moment locking her two hands under her head and assuming
a more comfortable position on the pillow He asked me that same
question again father and I said Yes Its to besoon Were going
to live at Four Forks in his own house and next winter were going to
Sacramento I suppose its all right father eh She emphasized the
question with a slight kick through the bedclothes as the parental
McClosky had fallen into an abstract revery

Yes surely said Mr McClosky recovering himself with some
confusion After a pause he looked down at the bedclothes and
patting them tenderly continued You couldnt have done better
Jinny They isnt a girl in Tuolumne ez could strike it ez rich as
you heveven if they got the chance He paused again and then said
Jinny

Yes father

Youse in bed and ondressed

Yes

You couldnt said Mr McClosky glancing hopelessly at the two
chairs and slowly rubbing his chinyou couldnt dress yourself again
could yer

Why father

Kinder get yourself into them things again he added hastily Not all
of em you know but some of em Not if I helped yousorter stood by
and lent a hand now and then with a strap or a buckle or a necktie or
a shoestring he continued still looking at the chairs and evidently
trying to boldly familiarize himself with their contents

Are you crazy father demanded Jenny suddenly sitting up with a
portentous switch of her yellow mane Mr McClosky rubbed one side of
his beard which already had the appearance of having been quite worn
away by that process and faintly dodged the question

Jinny he said tenderly stroking the bedclothes as he spoke this
yers whats the matter Thar is a stranger down stairsa stranger to
you lovey but a man ez Ive knowed a long time Hes been here about
an hour and hell be here ontil fower oclock when the upstage
passes Now I wants ye Jinny dear to get up and come down stairs and
kinder help me pass the time with him Its no use Jinny he went on
gently raising his hand to deprecate any interruption its no use He
wont go to bed he wont play keerds whiskey dont take no effect on
him Ever since I knowed him he was the most onsatisfactory critter to
hev round

What do you have him round for then interrupted Miss Jinny sharply

Mr McCloskys eyes fell Ef he hednt kem out of his way tonight to
do me a good turn I wouldnt ask ye Jinny I wouldnt so help me But
I thought ez I couldnt do any thing with him you might come down and
sorter fetch him Jinny as you did the others

Miss Jenny shrugged her pretty shoulders

Is he old or young

Hes young enough Jinny but he knows a power of things

What does he do

Not much I reckon Hes got money in the mill at Four Forks He
travels round a good deal Ive heard Jinny that hes a poetwrites
them rhymes you know Mr McClosky here appealed submissively but
directly to his daughter He remembered that she had frequently been
in receipt of printed elegaic couplets known as mottoes containing
enclosures equally saccharine

Miss Jenny slightly curled her pretty lip She had that fine contempt
for the illusions of fancy which belongs to the perfectly healthy young
animal

Not continued Mr McClosky rubbing his head reflectively not ez
Id advise ye Jinny to say any thing to him about poetry It aint
twenty minutes ago ez I did I set the whiskey afore him in the
parlor I wound up the musicbox and set it goin Then I sez to him
sociablelike and free Jest consider yourself in your own house and
repeat what you allow to be your finest production and he raged That
man Jinny jest raged Thars no end of the names he called me You
see Jinny continued Mr McClosky apologetically hes known me a
long time

But his daughter had already dismissed the question with her usual
directness Ill be down in a few moments father she said after a
pause but dont say any thing to him about itdont say I was abed

Mr McCloskys face beamed You was allers a good girl Jinny he
said dropping on one knee the better to imprint a respectful kiss on
her forehead But Jenny caught him by the wrists and for a moment held
him captive Father said she trying to fix his shy eyes with the
clear steady glance of her own all the girls that were there tonight
had some one with them Mame Robinson had her aunt Lucy Rance had her
mother Kate Pierson had her sisterall except me had some other
woman Father dear her lip trembled just a little I wish mother
hadnt died when I was so small I wish there was some other woman in
the family besides me I aint lonely with you father dear but if
there was only some one you know when the time comes for John and
me

Her voice here suddenly gave out but not her brave eyes that were
still fixed earnestly upon his face Mr McClosky apparently tracing
out a pattern on the bedquilt essayed words of comfort

Thar aint one of them gals ez youve named Jinny ez could do what
youve done with a whole Noahs ark of relations at their backs Thar
aint one ez wouldnt sacrifice her nearest relation to make the strike
that you hev Ez to mothers maybe my dear youre doin better without
one He rose suddenly and walked toward the door When he reached it
he turned and in his old deprecating manner said Dont be long
Jinny smiled and vanished from the head downward his canvas slippers
asserting themselves resolutely to the last

When Mr McClosky reached his parlor again his troublesome guest was
not there The decanter stood on the table untouched three or four
books lay upon the floor a number of photographic views of the Sierras
were scattered over the sofa two sofapillows a newspaper and a
Mexican blanket lay on the carpet as if the late occupant of the room
had tried to read in a recumbent position A French window opening
upon a veranda which never before in the history of the house had been
unfastened now betrayed by its waving lace curtain the way that the
fugitive had escaped Mr McClosky heaved a sigh of despair He looked
at the gorgeous carpet purchased in Sacramento at a fabulous price at
the crimson satin and rosewood furniture unparalleled in the history
of Tuolumne at the massivelyframed pictures on the walls and looked
beyond it through the open window to the reckless man who fleeing
these sybaritic allurements was smoking a cigar upon the moonlit road
This room which had so often awed the youth of Tuolumne into filial
respect was evidently a failure It remained to be seen if the Rose
herself had lost her fragrance I reckon Jinny will fetch him yet
said Mr McClosky with parental faith

He stepped from the window upon the veranda but he had scarcely done
this before his figure was detected by the stranger who at once
crossed the road When within a few feet of McClosky he stopped You
persistent old plantigrade he said in a low voice audible only to the
person addressed and a face full of affected anxiety why dont you go
to bed Didnt I tell you to go and leave me here alone In the name of
all thats idiotic and imbecile why do you continue to shuffle about
here Or are you trying to drive me crazy with your presence as you
have with that wretched musicbox that Ive just dropped under yonder
tree Its an hour and a half yet before the stage passes do you think
do you imagine for a single moment that I can tolerate you until then
eh Why dont you speak Are you asleep You dont mean to say that you
have the audacity to add somnambulism to your other weaknesses youre
not low enough to repeat yourself under any such weak pretext as that
eh

A fit of nervous coughing ended this extraordinary exordium and half
sitting half leaning against the veranda Mr McCloskys guest turned
his face and part of a slight elegant figure toward his host The
lower portion of this upturned face wore an habitual expression of
fastidious discontent with an occasional line of physical suffering
But the brow above was frank and critical and a pair of dark mirthful
eyes sat in playful judgment over the supersensitive mouth and its
suggestion

I allowed to go to bed Ridgeway said Mr McClosky meekly but my
girl Jinnys jist got back from a little tear up at Robinsons and
aint inclined to turn in yet You know what girls is So I thought we
three would jist have a social chat together to pass away the time

You mendacious old hypocrite She got back an hour ago said Ridgeway
as that savagelooking escort of hers who has been haunting the house
ever since can testify My belief is that like an enterprising idiot
as you are youve dragged that girl out of her bed that we might
mutually bore each other

Mr McClosky was too much stunned by this evidence of Ridgeways
apparently superhuman penetration to reply After enjoying his hosts
confusion for a moment with his eyes Ridgeways mouth asked grimly

And who is this girl anyway

Nancys

Your wifes

Yes But look yar Ridgeway said McClosky laying one hand
imploringly on Ridgeways sleeve not a word about her to Jinny She
thinks her mothers deaddied in Missouri Eh

Ridgeway nearly rolled from the veranda in an excess of rage Good God
Do you mean to say that you have been concealing from her a fact that
any day any moment may come to her ears That youve been letting
her grow up in ignorance of something that by this time she might have
outgrown and forgotten That you have been like a besotted old ass
all these years slowly forging a thunderbolt that any one may crush her
with Thatbut here Ridgeways cough took possession of his voice
and even put a moisture into his dark eyes as he looked at McCloskys
aimless hand feebly employed upon his beard

But said McClosky look how shes done Shes held her head as high
as any of em Shes to be married in a month to the richest man in the
county and he added cunningly Jack Ashe aint the kind o man to
sit by and hear any thing said of his wife or her relations you bet
But hushthats her foot on the stairs Shes cummin

She came I dont think the French window ever held a finer view than
when she put aside the curtains and stepped out She had dressed
herself simply and hurriedly but with a womans knowledge of her
best points so that you got the long curves of her shapely limbs the
shorter curves of her round waist and shoulders the long sweep of her
yellow braids the light of her gray eyes and even the delicate rose of
her complexion without knowing how it was delivered to you

The introduction by Mr McClosky was brief When Ridgeway had got over
the fact that it was two oclock in the morning and that the cheek of
this Tuolumne goddess nearest him was as dewy and fresh as an infants
that she looked like Marguerite without probably ever having heard
of Goethes heroine he talked I dare say very sensibly When Miss
Jennywho from her childhood had been brought up among the sons of
Anak and who was accustomed to have the supremacy of our noble sex
presented to her as a physical factfound herself in the presence of a
new and strange power in the slight and elegant figure beside her she
was at first frightened and cold But finding that this power against
which the weapons of her own physical charms were of no avail was
a kindly one albeit general she fell to worshipping it after the
fashion of woman and casting before it the fetishes and other idols of
her youth She even confessed to it So that in half an hour Ridgeway
was in possession of all the facts connected with her life and a great
many I fear of her fanciesexcept one When Mr McClosky found the
young people thus amicably disposed he calmly went to sleep

It was a pleasant time to each To Miss Jenny it had the charm of
novelty and she abandoned herself to it for that reason much more
freely and innocently than her companion who knew something more of the
inevitable logic of the position I do not think however he had any
intention of lovemaking I do not think he was at all conscious of
being in the attitude I am quite positive he would have shrunk from the
suggestion of disloyalty to the one woman whom he admitted to himself
he loved But like most poets he was much more true to an idea than
a fact and having a very lofty conception of womanhood with a
very sanguine nature he saw in each new face the possibilities of a
realization of his ideal It was perhaps an unfortunate thing for the
women particularly as he brought to each trial a surprising freshness
which was very deceptive and quite distinct from the blase
familiarity of the man of gallantry It was this perennial virginity of
the affections that most endeared him to the best women who were prone
to exercise toward him a chivalrous protectionas of one likely to go
astray unless looked afterand indulged in the dangerous combination
of sentiment with the highest maternal instincts It was this quality
which caused Jenny to recognize in him a certain boyishness that
required her womanly care and even induced her to offer to accompany
him to the crossroads when the time for his departure arrived With her
superior knowledge of woodcraft and the locality she would have kept
him from being lost I wot not but that she would have protected him
from bears or wolves but chiefly I think from the feline fascinations
of Mame Robinson and Lucy Rance who might be lying in wait for this
tender young poet Nor did she cease to be thankful that Providence had
so to speak delivered him as a trust into her hands

It was a lovely night The moon swung low and languished softly on
the snowy ridge beyond There were quaint odors in the still air and a
strange incense from the woods perfumed their young blood and seemed
to swoon in their pulses Small wonder that they lingered on the white
road that their feet climbed unwillingly the little hill where they
were to part and that when they at last reached it even the saving
grace of speech seemed to have forsaken them

For there they stood alone There was no sound nor motion in earth or
woods or heaven They might have been the one man and woman for whom
this goodly earth that lay at their feet rimmed with the deepest azure
was created And seeing this they turned toward each other with a
sudden instinct and their hands met and then their lips in one long
kiss

And then out of the mysterious distance came the sound of voices and
the sharp clatter of hoofs and wheels and Jenny slid awaya white
moonbeamfrom the hill For a moment she glimmered through the trees
and then reaching the house passed her sleeping father on the veranda
and darting into her bedroom locked the door threw open the window
and falling on her knees beside it leaned her hot cheeks upon her
hands and listened In a few moments she was rewarded by the sharp
clatter of hoofs on the stony road but it was only a horseman whose
dark figure was swiftly lost in the shadows of the lower road At
another time she might have recognized the man but her eyes and ears
were now all intent on something else It came presently with dancing
lights a musical rattle of harness a cadence of hoofbeats that
set her heart to beating in unisonand was gone A sudden sense of
loneliness came over her and tears gathered in her sweet eyes

She arose and looked around her There was the little bed the
dressingtable the roses that she had worn last night still fresh
and blooming in the little vase Every thing was there but every thing
looked strange The roses should have been withered for the party
seemed so long ago She could hardly remember when she had worn this
dress that lay upon the chair So she came back to the window and sank
down beside it with her cheek a trifle paler leaning on her hand and
her long braids reaching to the floor The stars paled slowly like her
cheek yet with eyes that saw not she still looked from her window for
the coming dawn

It came with violet deepening into purple with purple flushing
into rose with rose shining into silver and glowing into gold The
straggling line of black picketfence below that had faded away with
the stars came back with the sun What was that object moving by
the fence Jenny raised her head and looked intently It was a man
endeavoring to climb the pickets and falling backward with each
attempt Suddenly she started to her feet as if the rosy flushes of the
dawn had crimsoned her from forehead to shoulders then she stood white
as the wall with her hands clasped upon her bosom then with a single
bound she reached the door and with flying braids and fluttering
skirt sprang down the stairs and out to the garden walk When within a
few feet of the fence she uttered a cry the first she had giventhe
cry of a mother over her stricken babe of a tigress over her mangled
cub and in another moment she had leaped the fence and knelt beside
Ridgeway with his fainting head upon her breast

My boy my poor poor boy who has done this

Who indeed His clothes were covered with dust his waistcoat was torn
open and his handkerchief wet with the blood it could not stanch fell
from a cruel stab beneath his shoulder

Ridgeway my poor boy tell me what has happened

Ridgeway slowly opened his heavy blueveined lids and gazed upon her
Presently a gleam of mischief came into his dark eyes a smile stole
over his lips as he whispered slowly

Itwasyour kissdid it Jenny dear I had forgottenhow
highpriced the article was here Never mind Jennyhe feebly raised
her hand to his white lipsit wasworth it and fainted away

Jenny started to her feet and looked wildly around her Then with a
sudden resolution she stooped over the insensible man and with one
strong effort lifted him in her arms as if he had been a child When her
father a moment later rubbed his eyes and awoke from his sleep upon
the veranda it was to see a goddess erect and triumphant striding
toward the house with the helpless body of a man lying across that
breast where man had never lain beforea goddess at whose imperious
mandate he arose and cast open the doors before her And then when
she had laid her unconscious burden on the sofa the goddess fled and a
woman helpless and trembling stood before hima woman that cried out
that she had killed him that she was wicked wicked and that even
saying so staggered and fell beside her late burden And all that
Mr McClosky could do was to feebly rub his beard and say to himself
vaguely and incoherently that Jinny had fetched him


CHAPTER II


Before noon the next day it was generally believed throughout Four
Forks that Ridgeway Dent had been attacked and wounded at Chemisal Ridge
by a highwayman who fled on the approach of the Wingdam coach It is to
be presumed that this statement met with Ridgeways approval as he did
not contradict it nor supplement it with any details His wound was
severe but not dangerous After the first excitement had subsided
there was I think a prevailing impression common to the provincial
mind that his misfortune was the result of the defective moral quality
of his being a stranger and was in a vague sort of a way a warning to
others and a lesson to him Did you hear how that San Francisco feller
was took down the other night was the average tone of introductory
remark Indeed there was a general suggestion that Ridgeways presence
was one that no selfrespecting highminded highwayman honorably
conservative of the best interests of Tuolumne County could for a
moment tolerate

Except for the few words spoken on that eventful morning Ridgeway was
reticent of the past When Jenny strove to gather some details of
the affray that might offer a clew to his unknown assailant a subtle
twinkle in his brown eyes was the only response When Mr McClosky
attempted the same process the young gentleman threw abusive epithets
and eventually slippers teaspoons and other lighter articles within
the reach of an invalid at the head of his questioner I think hes
coming round Jinny said Mr McClosky he laid for me this morning
with a candlestick

It was about this time that Miss Jenny having sworn her father to
secrecy regarding the manner in which Ridgeway had been carried into the
house conceived the idea of addressing the young man as Mr Dent
and of apologizing for intruding whenever she entered the room in the
discharge of her household duties It was about this time that she
became more rigidly conscientious to those duties and less general in
her attentions It was at this time that the quality of the invalids
diet improved and that she consulted him less frequently about it It
was about this time that she began to see more company that the house
was greatly frequented by her former admirers with whom she rode
walked and danced It was at about this time also and when Ridgeway
was able to be brought out on the veranda in a chair that with great
archness of manner she introduced to him Miss Lucy Ashe the sister of
her betrothed a flashing brunette and terrible heartbreaker of Four
Forks And in the midst of this gayety she concluded that she would
spend a week with the Robinsons to whom she owed a visit She
enjoyed herself greatly there so much indeed that she became quite
holloweyed the result as she explained to her father of a too
frequent indulgence in festivity You see father I wont have many
chances after John and I are married you know how queer he is and I
must make the most of my time and she laughed an odd little laugh
which had lately become habitual to her And how is Mr Dent getting
on Her father replied that he was getting on very well indeedso
well in fact that he was able to leave for San Francisco two days ago
He wanted to be remembered to you Jinnyremembered kindlyyes
they is the very words he used said Mr McClosky looking down and
consulting one of his large shoes for corroboration Miss Jenny was glad
to hear that he was so much better Miss Jenny could not imagine any
thing that pleased her more than to know that he was so strong as to be
able to rejoin his friends again who must love him so much and be so
anxious about him Her father thought she would be pleased and now
that he was gone there was really no necessity for her to hurry
back Miss Jenny in a high metallic voice did not know that she
had expressed any desire to stay still if her presence had become
distasteful at home if her own father was desirous of getting rid
of her if when she was so soon to leave his roof forever he still
begrudged her those few days remaining ifMy God Jinny so help me
said Mr McClosky clutching despairingly at his beard I didnt go for
to say any thing of the kind I thought that youNever mind father
interrupted Jenny magnanimously you misunderstood me of course you
did you couldnt help ityoure a MAN Mr McClosky sorely crushed
would have vaguely protested but his daughter having relieved herself
after the manner of her sex with a mental personal application of an
abstract statement forgave him with a kiss

Nevertheless for two or three days after her return Mr McClosky
followed his daughter about the house with yearning eyes and
occasionally with timid diffident feet Sometimes he came upon her
suddenly at her household tasks with an excuse so palpably false and
a careless manner so outrageously studied that she was fain to be
embarrassed for him Later he took to rambling about the house at
night and was often seen noiselessly passing and repassing through the
hall after she had retired On one occasion he was surprised first by
sleep and then by the earlyrising Jenny as he lay on the rug outside
her chamberdoor You treat me like a child father said Jenny I
thought Jinny said the father apologeticallyI thought I
heard sounds as if you was takin on inside and listenin I fell
asleepYou dear old simpleminded baby said Jenny looking
past her fathers eyes and lifting his grizzled locks one by one with
meditative fingers what should I be takin on for Look how much
taller I am than you she said suddenly lifting herself up to the
extreme of her superb figure Then rubbing his head rapidly with both
hands as if she were anointing his hair with some rare unguent she
patted him on the back and returned to her room The result of this and
one or two other equally sympathetic interviews was to produce a
change in Mr McCloskys manner which was if possible still more
discomposing He grew unjustifiably hilarious cracked jokes with the
servants and repeated to Jenny humorous stories with the attitude of
facetiousness carefully preserved throughout the entire narration and
the point utterly ignored and forgotten Certain incidents reminded him
of funny things which invariably turned out to have not the slightest
relevancy or application He occasionally brought home with him
practical humorists with a sanguine hope of setting them going like
the musicbox for his daughters edification He essayed the singing of
melodies with great freedom of style and singular limitation of note
He sang Come haste to the Wedding Ye Lasses and Maidens of which he
knew a single line and that incorrectly as being peculiarly apt and
appropriate Yet away from the house and his daughters presence he was
silent and distraught His absence of mind was particularly noted by his
workmen at the Empire Quartz Mill Ef the old man dont look out and
wake up said his foreman hell hev them feet of his yet under the
stamps When he aint givin his mind to em they is altogether too
promiskuss

A few nights later Miss Jenny recognized her fathers hand in a timid
tap at the door She opened it and he stood before her with a valise
in his hand equipped as for a journey I takes the stage tonight
Jinny dear from Four Forks to Frisco Maybe I may drop in on Jack
afore I go Ill be back in a week Goodby

Goodby He still held her hand Presently he drew her back into the
room closing the door carefully and glancing around There was a look
of profound cunning in his eye as he said slowly

Bear up and keep dark Jinny dear and trust to the old man Various
men has various ways Thar is ways as is common and ways as is
uncommon ways as is easy and ways as is oneasy Bear up and keep
dark With this Delphic utterance he put his finger to his lips and
vanished

It was ten oclock when he reached Four Forks A few minutes later
he stood on the threshold of that dwelling described by the Four Forks
Sentinel as the palatial residence of John Ashe and known to the
local satirist as the ashbox Hevin to lay by two hours John he
said to his prospective soninlaw as he took his hand at the door
a few words of social converse not on business but strictly
private seems to be about as natral a thing as a man can do This
introduction evidently the result of some study and plainly committed
to memory seemed so satisfactory to Mr McClosky that he repeated
it again after John Ashe had led him into his private office where
depositing his valise in the middle of the floor and sitting down
before it he began carefully to avoid the eye of his host John Ashe a
tall dark handsome Kentuckian with whom even the trifles of life
were evidently full of serious import waited with a kind of chivalrous
respect the further speech of his guest Being utterly devoid of any
sense of the ridiculous he always accepted Mr McClosky as a grave
fact singular only from his own want of experience of the class

Ores is running light now said Mr McClosky with easy indifference

John Ashe returned that he had noticed the same fact in the receipts of
the mill at Four Forks

Mr McClosky rubbed his beard and looked at his valise as if for
sympathy and suggestion

You dont reckon on having any trouble with any of them chaps as you
cut out with Jinny

John Ashe rather haughtily had never thought of that I saw Rance
hanging round your house the other night when I took your daughter
home but he gave me a wide berth he added carelessly

Surely said Mr McClosky with a peculiar winking of the eye After a
pause he took a fresh departure from his valise

A few words John ez between man and man ez between my daughters
father and her husband who expects to be is about the thing I take it
as is fair and square I kem here to say them Theyre about Jinny my
gal

Ashes grave face brightened to Mr McCloskys evident discomposure

Maybe I should have said about her mother but the same bein a
stranger to you I says naterally Jinny

Ashe nodded courteously Mr McClosky with his eyes on his valise went
on

It is sixteen year ago as I married Mrs McClosky in the State of
Missouri She let on at the time to be a widdera widder with one
child When I say let on I mean to imply that I subsekently found out
that she was not a widder nor a wife and the father of the child was
so to speak onbeknowst Thet child was Jinnymy gal

With his eyes on his valise and quietly ignoring the whollycrimsoned
face and swiftlydarkening brow of his host he continued

Many little things sorter tended to make our home in Missouri
onpleasant A disposition to smash furniture and heave knives around
an inclination to howl when drunk and that frequent a habitooal use of
vulgar language and a tendency to cuss the casooal visitorseemed to
pint added Mr McClosky with submissive hesitation thatshewasso
to speakquite onsuited to the marriage relation in its holiest
aspeck

Damnation Why didntburst out John Ashe erect and furious

At the end of two year continued Mr McClosky still intent on the
valise I allowed Id get a diworce Et about thet time however
Providence sends a circus into thet town and a feller ez rode three
horses to onct Hevin allez a taste for athletic sports she left town
with this feller leavin me and Jinny behind I sent word to her thet
if she would give Jinny to me wed call it quits And she did

Tell me gasped Ashe did you ask your daughter to keep this from me
or did she do it of her own accord

She doesnt know it said Mr McClosky She thinks Im her father
and that her mothers dead

Then sir this is your

I dont know said Mr McClosky slowly ez Ive asked any one to
marry my Jinny I dont know ez Ive persood that ez a biziness or even
taken it up as a healthful recreation

John Ashe paced the room furiously Mr McCloskys eyes left the
valise and followed him curiously Where is this woman demanded Ashe
suddenly McCloskys eyes sought the valise again

She went to Kansas from Kansas she went into Texas from Texas she
eventooally came to Californy Being here Ive purvided her with money
when her business was slack through a friend

John Ashe groaned Shes gettin rather old and shaky for hosses and
now does the tightrope business and flying trapeze Never hevin seen
her perform continued Mr McClosky with conscientious caution I
cant say how she gets on On the bills she looks well Thar is
a poster said Mr McClosky glancing at Ashe and opening his
valisethar is a poster givin her performance at Marysville next
month Mr McClosky slowly unfolded a large yellowandblue printed
poster profusely illustrated She calls herself Mamselle J
Miglawski the great Russian Trapeziste

John Ashe tore it from his hand Of course he said suddenly facing
Mr McClosky you dont expect me to go on with this

Mr McClosky took up the poster carefully refolded it and returned
it to his valise When you break off with Jinny he said quietly
I dont want any thing said bout this She doesnt know it Shes a
woman and I reckon youre a white man

But what am I to say How am I to go back of my word

Write her a note Say something hez come to your knowledge dont say
what that makes you break it off You neednt be afeard Jinnyll ever
ask you what

John Ashe hesitated He felt he had been cruelly wronged No gentleman
no Ashe could go on further in this affair It was preposterous to
think of it But somehow he felt at the moment very unlike a gentleman
or an Ashe and was quite sure he should break down under Jennys steady
eyes But thenhe could write to her

So ores is about as light here as on the Ridge Well I reckon theyll
come up before the rains Goodnight Mr McClosky took the hand that
his host mechanically extended shook it gravely and was gone


When Mr McClosky a week later stepped again upon his own veranda he
saw through the French window the figure of a man in his parlor Under
his hospitable roof the sight was not unusual but for an instant a
subtle sense of disappointment thrilled him When he saw it was not the
face of Ashe turned toward him he was relieved but when he saw the
tawny beard and quick passionate eyes of Henry Rance he felt a new
sense of apprehension so that he fell to rubbing his beard almost upon
his very threshold

Jenny ran into the hall and seized her father with a little cry of joy
Father said Jenny in a hurried whisper dont mind HIM indicating
Rance with a toss of her yellow braids hes going soon And I think
father Ive done him wrong But its all over with John and me now
Read that note and see how hes insulted me Her lip quivered but she
went on Its Ridgeway that he means father and I believe it was HIS
hand struck Ridgeway down or that he knows who did But hush now not a
word

She gave him a feverish kiss and glided back into the parlor leaving
Mr McClosky perplexed and irresolute with the note in his hand He
glanced at it hurriedly and saw that it was couched in almost the very
words he had suggested But a sudden apprehensive recollection came
over him He listened and with an exclamation of dismay he seized his
hat and ran out of the house but too late At the same moment a quick
nervous footstep was heard upon the veranda the French window flew
open and with a light laugh of greeting Ridgeway stepped into the
room

Jennys finer ear first caught the step Jennys swifter feelings had
sounded the depths of hope of joy of despair before he entered the
room Jennys pale face was the only one that met his selfpossessed
and selfreliant when he stood before them An angry flush suffused
even the pink roots of Rances beard as he rose to his feet An ominous
fire sprang into Ridgeways eyes and a spasm of hate and scorn passed
over the lower part of his face and left the mouth and jaw immobile and
rigid

Yet he was the first to speak I owe you an apology he said to Jenny
with a suave scorn that brought the indignant blood back to her cheek
for this intrusion but I ask no pardon for withdrawing from the only
spot where that man dare confront me with safety

With an exclamation of rage Rance sprang toward him But as quickly
Jenny stood between them erect and menacing There must be no quarrel
here she said to Rance While I protect your right as my guest dont
oblige me to remind you of mine as your hostess She turned with a
halfdeprecatory air to Ridgeway but he was gone So was her father
Only Rance remained with a look of illconcealed triumph on his face

Without looking at him she passed toward the door When she reached
it she turned You asked me a question an hour ago Come to me in the
garden at nine oclock tonight and I will answer you But promise me
first to keep away from Mr Dent Give me your word not to seek himto
avoid him if he seeks you Do you promise It is well

He would have taken her hand but she waved him away In another moment
he heard the swift rustle of her dress in the hall the sound of her
feet upon the stair the sharp closing of her bedroom door and all was
quiet

And even thus quietly the day wore away and the night rose slowly from
the valley and overshadowed the mountains with purple wings that fanned
the still air into a breeze until the moon followed it and lulled
every thing to rest as with the layingon of white and benedictory
hands It was a lovely night but Henry Rance waiting impatiently
beneath a sycamore at the foot of the garden saw no beauty in earth or
air or sky A thousand suspicions common to a jealous nature a vague
superstition of the spot filled his mind with distrust and doubt
If this should be a trick to keep my hands off that insolent pup he
muttered But even as the thought passed his tongue a white figure
slid from the shrubbery near the house glided along the line of
picketfence and then stopped midway motionless in the moonlight

It was she But he scarcely recognized her in the white drapery that
covered her head and shoulders and breast He approached her with a
hurried whisper Let us withdraw from the moonlight Everybody can see
us here

We have nothing to say that cannot be said in the moonlight Henry
Rance she replied coldly receding from his proffered hand She
trembled for a moment as if with a chill and then suddenly turned upon
him Hold up your head and let me look at you Ive known only what
men are let me see what a traitor looks like

He recoiled more from her wild face than her words He saw from the
first that her hollow cheeks and hollow eyes were blazing with fever He
was no coward but he would have fled

You are ill Jenny he said you had best return to the house
Another time

Stop she cried hoarsely Move from this spot and Ill call for
help Attempt to leave me now and Ill proclaim you the assassin that
you are

It was a fair fight he said doggedly

Was it a fair fight to creep behind an unarmed and unsuspecting man
Was it a fair fight to try to throw suspicion on some one else Was it a
fair fight to deceive me Liar and coward that you are

He made a stealthy step toward her with evil eyes and a wickeder hand
that crept within his breast She saw the motion but it only stung her
to newer fury

Strike she said with blazing eyes throwing her hands open before
him Strike Are you afraid of the woman who dares you Or do you keep
your knife for the backs of unsuspecting men Strike I tell you
No Look then With a sudden movement she tore from her head and
shoulders the thick lace shawl that had concealed her figure and stood
before him Look she cried passionately pointing to the bosom and
shoulders of her white dress darkly streaked with faded stains and
ominous discolorationlook This is the dress I wore that morning
when I found him lying hereHEREbleeding from your cowardly knife
Look Do you see This is his bloodmy darling boys bloodone drop
of which dead and faded as it is is more precious to me than the whole
living pulse of any other man Look I come to you tonight christened
with his blood and dare you to strikedare you to strike him again
through me and mingle my blood with his Strike I implore you Strike
if you have any pity on me for Gods sake Strike if you are a man
Look Here lay his head on my shoulder here I held him to my breast
where neverso help me my Godanother manAh

She reeled against the fence and something that had flashed in Rances
hand dropped at her feet for another flash and report rolled him over
in the dust and across his writhing body two men strode and caught her
ere she fell

She has only fainted said Mr McClosky Jinny dear my girl speak
to me

What is this on her dress said Ridgeway kneeling beside her and
lifting his set and colorless face At the sound of his voice the color
came faintly back to her cheek she opened her eyes and smiled

Its only your blood dear boy she said but look a little deeper
and youll find my own

She put up her two yearning hands and drew his face and lips down to
her own When Ridgeway raised his head again her eyes were closed but
her mouth still smiled as with the memory of a kiss

They bore her to the house still breathing but unconscious That night
the road was filled with clattering horsemen and the summoned skill of
the countryside for leagues away gathered at her couch The wound they
said was not essentially dangerous but they had grave fears of the
shock to a system that already seemed suffering from some strange and
unaccountable nervous exhaustion The best medical skill of Tuolumne
happened to be young and observing and waited patiently an opportunity
to account for it He was presently rewarded

For toward morning she rallied and looked feebly around Then she
beckoned her father toward her and whispered Where is he

They took him away Jinny dear in a cart He wont trouble you agin
He stopped for Miss Jenny had raised herself on her elbow and was
levelling her black brows at him But two kicks from the young surgeon
and a significant motion towards the door sent Mr McClosky away
muttering How should I know that HE meant Ridgeway he said
apologetically as he went and returned with the young gentleman The
surgeon who was still holding her pulse smiled and thought
thatwith a little careand attentionthe stimulantsmight
bediminishedandhemight leavethe patient for some hours with
perfect safety He would give further directions to Mr McCloskydown
stairs

It was with great archness of manner that half an hour later Mr
McClosky entered the room with a preparatory cough and it was with some
disappointment that he found Ridgeway standing quietly by the window
and his daughter apparently fallen into a light doze He was still more
concerned when after Ridgeway had retired noticing a pleasant smile
playing about her lips he said softly

You was thinking of some one Jinny

Yes father the gray eyes met his steadilyof poor John Ashe

Her recovery was swift Nature that had seemed to stand jealously aloof
from her in her mental anguish was kind to the physical hurt of her
favorite child The superb physique which had been her charm and her
trial now stood her in good stead The healing balsam of the pine the
balm of resinous gums and the rare medicaments of Sierran altitudes
touched her as it might have touched the wounded doe so that in two
weeks she was able to walk about And when at the end of the month
Ridgeway returned from a flying visit to San Francisco and jumped from
the Wingdam coach at four oclock in the morning the Rose of Tuolumne
with the dewy petals of either cheek fresh as when first unfolded to his
kiss confronted him on the road

With a common instinct their young feet both climbed the little hill
now sacred to their thought When they reached its summit they were
both I think a little disappointed There is a fragrance in the
unfolding of a passion that escapes the perfect flower Jenny thought
the night was not as beautiful Ridgeway that the long ride had blunted
his perceptions But they had the frankness to confess it to each
other with the rare delight of such a confession and the comparison
of details which they thought each had forgotten And with this and an
occasional pitying reference to the blank period when they had not known
each other hand in hand they reached the house

Mr McClosky was awaiting them impatiently upon the veranda When Miss
Jenny had slipped up stairs to replace a collar that stood somewhat
suspiciously awry Mr McClosky drew Ridgeway solemnly aside He held a
large theatre poster in one hand and an open newspaper in the other

I allus said he remarked slowly with the air of merely renewing a
suspended conversationI allus said that riding three horses to onct
wasnt exactly in her line It would seem that it aint From remarks in
this yer paper it would appear that she tried it on at Marysville last
week and broke her neck




A PASSAGE IN THE LIFE OF MR JOHN OAKHURST


He always thought it must have been fate Certainly nothing could have
been more inconsistent with his habits than to have been in the Plaza at
seven oclock of that midsummer morning The sight of his colorless
face in Sacramento was rare at that season and indeed at any season
anywhere publicly before two oclock in the afternoon Looking back
upon it in afteryears in the light of a chanceful life he determined
with the characteristic philosophy of his profession that it must have
been fate

Yet it is my duty as a strict chronicler of facts to state that Mr
Oakhursts presence there that morning was due to a very simple cause
At exactly halfpast six the bank being then a winner to the amount of
twenty thousand dollars he had risen from the farotable relinquished
his seat to an accomplished assistant and withdrawn quietly without
attracting a glance from the silent anxious faces bowed over the table
But when he entered his luxurious sleepingroom across the passageway
he was a little shocked at finding the sun streaming through an
inadvertently opened window Something in the rare beauty of the
morning perhaps something in the novelty of the idea struck him as he
was about to close the blinds and he hesitated Then taking his hat
from the table he stepped down a private staircase into the street

The people who were abroad at that early hour were of a class quite
unknown to Mr Oakhurst There were milkmen and hucksters delivering
their wares small tradespeople opening their shops housemaids sweeping
doorsteps and occasionally a child These Mr Oakhurst regarded with
a certain cold curiosity perhaps quite free from the cynical disfavor
with which he generally looked upon the more pretentious of his
race whom he was in the habit of meeting Indeed I think he was not
altogether displeased with the admiring glances which these humble women
threw after his handsome face and figure conspicuous even in a
country of finelooking men While it is very probable that this wicked
vagabond in the pride of his social isolation would have been coldly
indifferent to the advances of a fine lady a little girl who ran
admiringly by his side in a ragged dress had the power to call a faint
flush into his colorless cheek He dismissed her at last but not
until she had found outwhat sooner or later her largehearted and
discriminating sex inevitably didthat he was exceedingly free and
openhanded with his money and alsowhat perhaps none other of her
sex ever didthat the bold black eyes of this fine gentleman were in
reality of a brownish and even tender gray

There was a small garden before a white cottage in a sidestreet
that attracted Mr Oakhursts attention It was filled with roses
heliotrope and verbenaflowers familiar enough to him in the
expensive and more portable form of bouquets but as it seemed to him
then never before so notably lovely Perhaps it was because the dew was
yet fresh upon them perhaps it was because they were unplucked but
Mr Oakhurst admired themnot as a possible future tribute to the
fascinating and accomplished Miss Ethelinda then performing at the
Varieties for Mr Oakhursts especial benefit as she had often assured
him nor yet as a douceur to the inthralling Miss Montmorrissy with
whom Mr Oakhurst expected to sup that evening but simply for himself
and mayhap for the flowers sake Howbeit he passed on and so out
into the open Plaza where finding a bench under a cottonwoodtree he
first dusted the seat with his handkerchief and then sat down

It was a fine morning The air was so still and calm that a sigh from
the sycamores seemed like the deepdrawn breath of the just awakening
tree and the faint rustle of its boughs as the outstretching of cramped
and reviving limbs Far away the Sierras stood out against a sky so
remote as to be of no positive colorso remote that even the sun
despaired of ever reaching it and so expended its strength recklessly
on the whole landscape until it fairly glittered in a white and vivid
contrast With a very rare impulse Mr Oakhurst took off his hat and
half reclined on the bench with his face to the sky Certain birds who
had taken a critical attitude on a spray above him apparently began an
animated discussion regarding his possible malevolent intentions One or
two emboldened by the silence hopped on the ground at his feet until
the sound of wheels on the gravelwalk frightened them away

Looking up he saw a man coming slowly toward him wheeling a
nondescript vehicle in which a woman was partly sitting partly
reclining Without knowing why Mr Oakhurst instantly conceived that
the carriage was the invention and workmanship of the man partly from
its oddity partly from the strong mechanical hand that grasped it and
partly from a certain pride and visible consciousness in the manner
in which the man handled it Then Mr Oakhurst saw something more the
mans face was familiar With that regal faculty of not forgetting
a face that had ever given him professional audience he instantly
classified it under the following mental formula At Frisco Polka
Saloon Lost his weeks wages I reckonseventy dollarson red Never
came again There was however no trace of this in the calm eyes and
unmoved face that he turned upon the stranger who on the contrary
blushed looked embarrassed hesitated and then stopped with an
involuntary motion that brought the carriage and its fair occupant face
to face with Mr Oakhurst

I should hardly do justice to the position she will occupy in this
veracious chronicle by describing the lady now if indeed I am able to
do it at all Certainly the popular estimate was conflicting The late
Col Starbottleto whose large experience of a charming sex I have
before been indebted for many valuable suggestionshad I regret to
say depreciated her fascinations A yellowfaced cripple by dash
a sick woman with mahogany eyes one of your blanked spiritual
creatureswith no flesh on her bones On the other hand however she
enjoyed later much complimentary disparagement from her own sex Miss
Celestina Howard second leader in the ballet at the Varieties had
with great alliterative directness in afteryears denominated her
as an aquiline asp Mlle Brimborion remembered that she had always
warned Mr Jack that this woman would empoison him But Mr
Oakhurst whose impressions are perhaps the most important only saw a
pale thin deepeyed woman raised above the level of her companion
by the refinement of long suffering and isolation and a certain shy
virginity of manner There was a suggestion of physical purity in the
folds of her freshlooking robe and a certain picturesque tastefulness
in the details that without knowing why made him think that the robe
was her invention and handiwork even as the carriage she occupied was
evidently the work of her companion Her own hand a trifle too thin
but wellshaped subtlefingered and gentlewomanly rested on the side
of the carriage the counterpart of the strong mechanical grasp of her
companions

There was some obstruction to the progress of the vehicle and Mr
Oakhurst stepped forward to assist While the wheel was being lifted
over the curbstone it was necessary that she should hold his arm and
for a moment her thin hand rested there light and cold as a snowflake
and then as it seemed to him like a snowflake melted away Then there
was a pause and then conversation the lady joining occasionally and
shyly

It appeared that they were man and wife that for the past two years she
had been a great invalid and had lost the use of her lower limbs from
rheumatism that until lately she had been confined to her bed until
her husbandwho was a mastercarpenterhad bethought himself to make
her this carriage He took her out regularly for an airing before
going to work because it was his only time andthey attracted less
attention They had tried many doctors but without avail They had been
advised to go to the Sulphur Springs but it was expensive Mr Decker
the husband had once saved eighty dollars for that purpose but while
in San Francisco had his pocket pickedMr Decker was so senseless
The intelligent reader need not be told that it is the lady who is
speaking They had never been able to make up the sum again and they
had given up the idea It was a dreadful thing to have ones pocket
picked Did he not think so

Her husbands face was crimson but Mr Oakhursts countenance was quite
calm and unmoved as he gravely agreed with her and walked by her
side until they passed the little garden that he had admired Here
Mr Oakhurst commanded a halt and going to the door astounded the
proprietor by a preposterously extravagant offer for a choice of the
flowers Presently he returned to the carriage with his arms full of
roses heliotrope and verbena and cast them in the lap of the invalid
While she was bending over them with childish delight Mr Oakhurst took
the opportunity of drawing her husband aside

Perhaps he said in a low voice and a manner quite free from any
personal annoyanceperhaps its just as well that you lied to her
as you did You can say now that the pickpocket was arrested the other
day and you got your money back Mr Oakhurst quietly slipped four
twentydollar goldpieces into the broad hand of the bewildered Mr
Decker Say thator any thing you likebut the truth Promise me you
wont say that

The man promised Mr Oakhurst quietly returned to the front of the
little carriage The sick woman was still eagerly occupied with the
flowers and as she raised her eyes to his her faded cheek seemed to
have caught some color from the roses and her eyes some of their dewy
freshness But at that instant Mr Oakhurst lifted his hat and before
she could thank him was gone

I grieve to say that Mr Decker shamelessly broke his promise That
night in the very goodness of his heart and uxorious selfabnegation
he like all devoted husbands not only offered himself but his friend
and benefactor as a sacrifice on the familyaltar It is only fair
however to add that he spoke with great fervor of the generosity of Mr
Oakhurst and dwelt with an enthusiasm quite common with his class on
the mysterious fame and prodigal vices of the gambler

And now Elsie dear say that youll forgive me said Mr Decker
dropping on one knee beside his wifes couch I did it for the best It
was for you dearey that I put that money on them cards that night in
Frisco I thought to win a heapenough to take you away and enough
left to get you a new dress

Mrs Decker smiled and pressed her husbands hand I do forgive you
Joe dear she said still smiling with eyes abstractedly fixed on the
ceiling and you ought to be whipped for deceiving me so you bad boy
and making me make such a speech There say no more about it If youll
be very good hereafter and will just now hand me that cluster of roses
Ill forgive you She took the branch in her angers lifted the roses
to her face and presently said behind their leaves

Joe

What is it lovey

Do you think that this Mrwhat do you call himJack Oakhurst would
have given that money back to you if I hadnt made that speech

Yes

If he hadnt seen me at all

Mr Decker looked up His wife had managed in some way to cover up
her whole face with the roses except her eyes which were dangerously
bright

No It was you Elsieit was all along of seeing you that made him do
it

A poor sick woman like me

A sweet little lovely pooty ElsieJoes own little wifey how could
he help it

Mrs Decker fondly cast one arm around her husbands neck still keeping
the roses to her face with the other From behind them she began to
murmur gently and idiotically Dear ole square Joey Elsies oney
booful big bear But really I do not see that my duty as a chronicler
of facts compels me to continue this little ladys speech any further
and out of respect to the unmarried reader I stop

Nevertheless the next morning Mrs Decker betrayed some slight
and apparently uncalled for irritability on reaching the Plaza and
presently desired her husband to wheel her back home Moreover she
was very much astonished at meeting Mr Oakhurst just as they were
returning and even doubted if it were he and questioned her husband
as to his identity with the stranger of yesterday as he approached Her
manner to Mr Oakhurst also was quite in contrast with her husbands
frank welcome Mr Oakhurst instantly detected it Her husband has
told her all and she dislikes me he said to himself with that fatal
appreciation of the halftruths of a womans motives that causes the
wisest masculine critic to stumble He lingered only long enough to take
the business address of the husband and then lifting his hat gravely
without looking at the lady went his way It struck the honest
mastercarpenter as one of the charming anomalies of his wifes
character that although the meeting was evidently very much
constrained and unpleasant instantly afterward his wifes spirits began
to rise You was hard on him a leetle hard wasnt you Elsie
said Mr Decker deprecatingly Im afraid he may think Ive broke
my promiseAh indeed said the lady indifferently Mr Decker
instantly stepped round to the front of the vehicle You look like an
A 1 firstclass lady riding down Broadway in her own carriage Elsie
said he I never seed you lookin so peart and sassy before

A few days later the proprietor of the San Isabel Sulphur Springs
received the following note in Mr Oakhursts wellknown dainty hand


DEAR STEVEIve been thinking over your proposition to buy Nicholss
quarterinterest and have concluded to go in But I dont see how the
thing will pay until you have more accommodation down there and for the
best classI mean MY customers What we want is an extension to the
main building and two or three cottages put up I send down a builder
to take hold of the job at once He takes his sick wife with him and
you are to look after them as you would for one of us

I may run down there myself after the races just to look after things
but I shant set up any game this season

Yours always

JOHN OAKHURST


It was only the last sentence of this letter that provoked criticism
I can understand said Mr Hamlin a professional brother to whom Mr
Oakhursts letter was shownI can understand why Jack goes in heavy
and builds for its a sure spec and is bound to be a mighty soft thing
in time if he comes here regularly But why in blank he dont set up a
bank this season and take the chance of getting some of the money back
that he puts into circulation in building is what gets me I wonder
now he mused deeply what IS his little game

The season had been a prosperous one to Mr Oakhurst and proportionally
disastrous to several members of the legislature judges colonels
and others who had enjoyed but briefly the pleasure of Mr Oakhursts
midnight society And yet Sacramento had become very dull to him He had
lately formed a habit of early morning walks so unusual and startling
to his friends both male and female as to occasion the intensest
curiosity Two or three of the latter set spies upon his track but the
inquisition resulted only in the discovery that Mr Oakhurst walked to
the Plaza sat down upon one particular bench for a few moments and
then returned without seeing anybody and the theory that there was a
woman in the case was abandoned A few superstitious gentlemen of his
own profession believed that he did it for luck Some others more
practical declared that he went out to study points

After the races at Marysville Mr Oakhurst went to San Francisco from
that place he returned to Marysville but a few days after was seen at
San Jose Santa Cruz and Oakland Those who met him declared that his
manner was restless and feverish and quite unlike his ordinary calmness
and phlegm Col Starbottle pointed out the fact that at San Francisco
at the club Jack had declined to deal Hand shaky sir depend upon
it Dont stimulate enoughblank him

From San Jose he started to go to Oregon by land with a rather expensive
outfit of horses and camp equipage but on reaching Stockton he
suddenly diverged and four hours later found him with a single horse
entering the canyon of the San Isabel Warm Sulphur Springs

It was a pretty triangular valley lying at the foot of three sloping
mountains dark with pines and fantastic with madrono and manzanita
Nestling against the mountainside the straggling buildings and long
piazza of the hotel glittered through the leaves and here and there
shone a white toylike cottage Mr Oakhurst was not an admirer of
Nature but he felt something of the same novel satisfaction in the
view that he experienced in his first morning walk in Sacramento And
now carriages began to pass him on the road filled with gaylydressed
women and the cold California outlines of the landscape began to take
upon themselves somewhat of a human warmth and color And then the long
hotel piazza came in view efflorescent with the fulltoiletted fair
Mr Oakhurst a good rider after the California fashion did not check
his speed as he approached his destination but charged the hotel at a
gallop threw his horse on his haunches within a foot of the piazza and
then quietly emerged from the cloud of dust that veiled his dismounting

Whatever feverish excitement might have raged within all his habitual
calm returned as he stepped upon the piazza With the instinct of
long habit he turned and faced the battery of eyes with the same cold
indifference with which he had for years encountered the halfhidden
sneers of men and the halffrightened admiration of women Only one
person stepped forward to welcome him Oddly enough it was Dick
Hamilton perhaps the only one present who by birth education and
position might have satisfied the most fastidious social critic
Happily for Mr Oakhursts reputation he was also a very rich banker
and social leader Do you know who that is you spoke to asked
young Parker with an alarmed expression Yes replied Hamilton with
characteristic effrontery The man you lost a thousand dollars to last
week I only know him SOCIALLY But isnt he a gambler queried the
youngest Miss Smith He is replied Hamilton but I wish my dear
young lady that we all played as open and honest a game as our friend
yonder and were as willing as he is to abide by its fortunes

But Mr Oakhurst was happily out of hearing of this colloquy and was
even then lounging listlessly yet watchfully along the upper hall
Suddenly he heard a light footstep behind him and then his name called
in a familiar voice that drew the blood quickly to his heart He turned
and she stood before him

But how transformed If I have hesitated to describe the holloweyed
cripple the quaintlydressed artisans wife a few pages ago what
shall I do with this graceful shapely elegantlyattired gentlewoman
into whom she has been merged within these two months In good faith she
was very pretty You and I my dear madam would have been quick to
see that those charming dimples were misplaced for true beauty and too
fixed in their quality for honest mirthfulness that the delicate lines
around these aquiline nostrils were cruel and selfish that the sweet
virginal surprise of these lovely eyes were as apt to be opened on
her plate as upon the gallant speeches of her dinner partner that her
sympathetic color came and went more with her own spirits than yours
But you and I are not in love with her dear madam and Mr Oakhurst
is And even in the folds of her Parisian gown I am afraid this poor
fellow saw the same subtle strokes of purity that he had seen in her
homespun robe And then there was the delightful revelation that she
could walk and that she had dear little feet of her own in the tiniest
slippers of her French shoemaker with such preposterous blue bows and
Chappells own stampRue de something or other Parison the narrow
sole

He ran toward her with a heightened color and outstretched hands But
she whipped her own behind her glanced rapidly up and down the long
hall and stood looking at him with a halfaudacious halfmischievous
admiration in utter contrast to her old reserve

Ive a great mind not to shake hands with you at all You passed me
just now on the piazza without speaking and I ran after you as I
suppose many another poor woman has done

Mr Oakhurst stammered that she was so changed

The more reason why you should know me Who changed me You You have
recreated me You found a helpless crippled sick povertystricken
woman with one dress to her back and that her own make and you gave
her life health strength and fortune You did and you know it sir
How do you like your work She caught the sideseams of her gown in
either hand and dropped him a playful courtesy Then with a sudden
relenting gesture she gave him both her hands

Outrageous as this speech was and unfeminine as I trust every fair
reader will deem it I fear it pleased Mr Oakhurst Not but that he was
accustomed to a certain frank female admiration but then it was of the
coulisse and not of the cloister with which he always persisted in
associating Mrs Decker To be addressed in this way by an invalid
Puritan a sick saint with the austerity of suffering still clothing
her a woman who had a Bible on the dressingtable who went to church
three times a day and was devoted to her husband completely bowled him
over He still held her hands as she went on

Why didnt you come before What were you doing in Marysville in San
Jose in Oakland You see I have followed you I saw you as you came
down the canyon and knew you at once I saw your letter to Joseph
and knew you were coming Why didnt you write to me You will some
timeGoodevening Mr Hamilton

She had withdrawn her hands but not until Hamilton ascending the
staircase was nearly abreast of them He raised his hat to her with
wellbred composure nodded familiarly to Oakhurst and passed on When
he had gone Mrs Decker lifted her eyes to Mr Oakhurst Some day I
shall ask a great favor of you

Mr Oakhurst begged that it should be now

No not until you know me better Then some day I shall want you
tokill that man

She laughed such a pleasant little ringing laugh such a display of
dimplesalbeit a little fixed in the corners of her mouthsuch an
innocent light in her brown eyes and such a lovely color in her cheeks
that Mr Oakhurst who seldom laughed was fain to laugh too It was as
if a lamb had proposed to a fox a foray into a neighboring sheepfold

A few evenings after this Mrs Decker arose from a charmed circle of
her admirers on the hotel piazza excused herself for a few moments
laughingly declined an escort and ran over to her little cottageone
of her husbands creationacross the road Perhaps from the sudden
and unwonted exercise in her still convalescent state she breathed
hurriedly and feverishly as she entered her boudoir and once or twice
placed her hand upon her breast She was startled on turning up the
light to find her husband lying on the sofa

You look hot and excited Elsie love said Mr Decker You aint took
worse are you

Mrs Deckers face had paled but now flushed again No she said
only a little pain here as she again placed her hand upon her
corsage

Can I do any thing for you said Mr Decker rising with affectionate
concern

Run over to the hotel and get me some brandy quick

Mr Decker ran Mrs Decker closed and bolted the door and then putting
her hand to her bosom drew out the pain It was folded foursquare and
was I grieve to say in Mr Oakhursts handwriting

She devoured it with burning eyes and cheeks until there came a step
upon the porch then she hurriedly replaced it in her bosom and
unbolted the door Her husband entered She raised the spirits to her
lips and declared herself better

Are you going over there again tonight asked Mr Decker
submissively

No said Mrs Decker with her eyes fixed dreamily on the floor

I wouldnt if I was you said Mr Decker with a sigh of relief After
a pause he took a seat on the sofa and drawing his wife to his side
said Do you know what I was thinking of when you came in Elsie
Mrs Decker ran her fingers through his stiff black hair and couldnt
imagine

I was thinking of old times Elsie I was thinking of the days when
I built that kerridge for you Elsiewhen I used to take you out to
ride and was both hoss and driver We was poor then and you was sick
Elsie but we was happy Weve got money now and a house and youre
quite another woman I may say dear that youre a NEW woman And
thats where the trouble comes in I could build you a kerridge Elsie
I could build you a house Elsiebut there I stopped I couldnt build
up YOU Youre strong and pretty Elsie and fresh and new But somehow
Elsie you aint no work of mine

He paused With one hand laid gently on his forehead and the other
pressed upon her bosom as if to feel certain of the presence of her
pain she said sweetly and soothingly

But it was your work dear

Mr Decker shook his head sorrowfully No Elsie not mine I had the
chance to do it once and I let it go Its done nowbut not by me

Mrs Decker raised her surprised innocent eyes to his He kissed her
tenderly and then went on in a more cheerful voice

That aint all I was thinking of Elsie I was thinking that maybe you
give too much of your company to that Mr Hamilton Not that theres any
wrong in it to you or him but it might make people talk Youre the
only one here Elsie said the mastercarpenter looking fondly at his
wife who isnt talked about whose work aint inspected or condemned

Mrs Decker was glad he had spoken about it She had thought so too But
she could not well be uncivil to Mr Hamilton who was a fine gentleman
without making a powerful enemy And hes always treated me as if I was
a born lady in his own circle added the little woman with a certain
pride that made her husband fondly smile But I have thought of a plan
He will not stay here if I should go away If for instance I went
to San Francisco to visit ma for a few days he would be gone before I
should return

Mr Decker was delighted By all means he said go tomorrow Jack
Oakhurst is going down and Ill put you in his charge

Mrs Decker did not think it was prudent Mr Oakhurst is our friend
Joseph but you know his reputation In fact she did not know that
she ought to go now knowing that he was going the same day but with
a kiss Mr Decker overcame her scruples She yielded gracefully Few
women in fact knew how to give up a point as charmingly as she

She staid a week in San Francisco When she returned she was a trifle
thinner and paler than she had been This she explained as the result of
perhaps too active exercise and excitement I was out of doors nearly
all the time as ma will tell you she said to her husband and always
alone I am getting quite independent now she added gayly I dont
want any escort I believe Joey dear I could get along even without
you Im so brave

But her visit apparently had not been productive of her impelling
design Mr Hamilton had not gone but had remained and called upon
them that very evening Ive thought of a plan Joey dear said Mrs
Decker when he had departed Poor Mr Oakhurst has a miserable room at
the hotel Suppose you ask him when he returns from San Francisco
to stop with us He can have our spareroom I dont think she added
archly that Mr Hamilton will call often Her husband laughed
intimated that she was a little coquette pinched her cheek
and complied The queer thing about a woman he said afterward
confidentially to Mr Oakhurst is that without having any plan
of her own shell take anybodys and build a house on it entirely
different to suit herself And dern my skin if youll be able to say
whether or not you didnt give the scale and measurements yourself
Thats what gets me

The next week Mr Oakhurst was installed in the Deckers cottage The
business relations of her husband and himself were known to all and her
own reputation was above suspicion Indeed few women were more popular
She was domestic she was prudent she was pious In a country of great
feminine freedom and latitude she never rode or walked with anybody
but her husband In an epoch of slang and ambiguous expression she was
always precise and formal in her speech In the midst of a fashion of
ostentatious decoration she never wore a diamond nor a single
valuable jewel She never permitted an indecorum in public She never
countenanced the familiarities of California society She declaimed
against the prevailing tone of infidelity and scepticism in religion
Few people who were present will ever forget the dignified yet stately
manner with which she rebuked Mr Hamilton in the public parlor for
entering upon the discussion of a work on materialism lately published
and some among them also will not forget the expression of amused
surprise on Mr Hamiltons face that gradually changed to sardonic
gravity as he courteously waived his point certainly not Mr Oakhurst
who from that moment began to be uneasily impatient of his friend
and evenif such a term could be applied to any moral quality in Mr
Oakhurstto fear him

For during this time Mr Oakhurst had begun to show symptoms of a change
in his usual habits He was seldom if ever seen in his old haunts
in a barroom or with his old associates Pink and white notes in
distracted handwriting accumulated on the dressingtable in his rooms
at Sacramento It was given out in San Francisco that he had some
organic disease of the heart for which his physician had prescribed
perfect rest He read more he took long walks he sold his fast horses
he went to church

I have a very vivid recollection of his first appearance there He did
not accompany the Deckers nor did he go into their pew but came in as
the service commenced and took a seat quietly in one of the backpews
By some mysterious instinct his presence became presently known to the
congregation some of whom so far forgot themselves in their curiosity
as to face around and apparently address their responses to him Before
the service was over it was pretty well understood that miserable
sinners meant Mr Oakhurst Nor did this mysterious influence fail
to affect the officiating clergyman who introduced an allusion to
Mr Oakhursts calling and habits in a sermon on the architecture of
Solomons temple and in a manner so pointed and yet labored as to
cause the youngest of us to flame with indignation Happily however
it was lost upon Jack I do not think he even heard it His handsome
colorless face albeit a trifle worn and thoughtful was inscrutable
Only once during the singing of a hymn at a certain note in the
contraltos voice there crept into his dark eyes a look of wistful
tenderness so yearning and yet so hopeless that those who were
watching him felt their own glisten Yet I retain a very vivid
remembrance of his standing up to receive the benediction with the
suggestion in his manner and tightlybuttoned coat of taking the fire
of his adversary at ten paces After church he disappeared as quietly
as he had entered and fortunately escaped hearing the comments on his
rash act His appearance was generally considered as an impertinence
attributable only to some wanton fancy or possibly a bet One or two
thought that the sexton was exceedingly remiss in not turning him out
after discovering who he was and a prominent pewholder remarked
that if he couldnt take his wife and daughters to that church without
exposing them to such an influence he would try to find some church
where he could Another traced Mr Oakhursts presence to certain Broad
Church radical tendencies which he regretted to say he had lately noted
in their pastor Deacon Sawyer whose delicatelyorganized sickly wife
had already borne him eleven children and died in an ambitious attempt
to complete the dozen avowed that the presence of a person of Mr
Oakhursts various and indiscriminate gallantries was an insult to the
memory of the deceased that as a man he could not brook

It was about this time that Mr Oakhurst contrasting himself with a
conventional world in which he had hitherto rarely mingled became aware
that there was something in his face figure and carriage quite unlike
other mensomething that if it did not betray his former career at
least showed an individuality and originality that was suspicious In
this belief he shaved off his long silken mustache and religiously
brushed out his clustering curls every morning He even went so far as
to affect a negligence of dress and hid his small slim arched feet
in the largest and heaviest walkingshoes There is a story told that
he went to his tailor in Sacramento and asked him to make him a suit
of clothes like everybody else The tailor familiar with Mr Oakhursts
fastidiousness did not know what he meant I mean said Mr Oakhurst
savagely something RESPECTABLEsomething that doesnt exactly fit
me you know But however Mr Oakhurst might hide his shapely limbs
in homespun and homemade garments there was something in his carriage
something in the pose of his beautiful head something in the strong
and fine manliness of his presence something in the perfect and utter
discipline and control of his muscles something in the high repose of
his naturea repose not so much a matter of intellectual ruling as of
his very naturethat go where he would and with whom he was
always a notable man in ten thousand Perhaps this was never so clearly
intimated to Mr Oakhurst as when emboldened by Mr Hamiltons advice
and assistance and his own predilections he became a San Francisco
broker Even before objection was made to his presence in the
Boardthe objection I remember was urged very eloquently by Watt
Sanders who was supposed to be the inventor of the freezingout
system of disposing of poor stockholders and who also enjoyed the
reputation of having been the impelling cause of Briggs of Tuolumnes
ruin and suicideeven before this formal protest of respectability
against lawlessness the aquiline suggestions of Mr Oakhursts mien and
countenance not only prematurely fluttered the pigeons but absolutely
occasioned much uneasiness among the fishhawks who circled below
him with their booty Dash me but hes as likely to go after us as
anybody said Joe Fielding


It wanted but a few days before the close of the brief summer season at
San Isabel Warm Springs Already there had been some migration of the
more fashionable and there was an uncomfortable suggestion of dregs and
lees in the social life that remained Mr Oakhurst was moody It was
hinted that even the secure reputation of Mrs Decker could no longer
protect her from the gossip which his presence excited It is but fair
to her to say that during the last few weeks of this trying ordeal
she looked like a sweet pale martyr and conducted herself toward her
traducers with the gentle forgiving manner of one who relied not upon
the idle homage of the crowd but upon the security of a principle that
was dearer than popular favor They talk about myself and Mr Oakhurst
my dear she said to a friend but heaven and my husband can best
answer their calumny It never shall be said that my husband ever turned
his back upon a friend in the moment of his adversity because the
position was changedbecause his friend was poor and he was rich
This was the first intimation to the public that Jack had lost money
although it was known generally that the Deckers had lately bought some
valuable property in San Francisco

A few evenings after this an incident occurred which seemed to
unpleasantly discord with the general social harmony that had always
existed at San Isabel It was at dinner and Mr Oakhurst and Mr
Hamilton who sat together at a separate table were observed to rise
in some agitation When they reached the hall by a common instinct they
stepped into a little breakfastroom which was vacant and closed the
door Then Mr Hamilton turned with a halfamused halfserious smile
toward his friend and said

If we are to quarrel Jack Oakhurstyou and Iin the name of all
that is ridiculous dont let it be about a

I do not know what was the epithet intended It was either unspoken
or lost for at that very instant Mr Oakhurst raised a wineglass and
dashed its contents into Hamiltons face

As they faced each other the men seemed to have changed natures
Mr Oakhurst was trembling with excitement and the wineglass that he
returned to the table shivered between his fingers Mr Hamilton stood
there grayish white erect and dripping After a pause he said
coldly

So be it But remember our quarrel commences here If I fall by your
hand you shall not use it to clear her character if you fall by mine
you shall not be called a martyr I am sorry it has come to this but
amen the sooner now the better

He turned proudly dropped his lids over cold steelblue eyes as if
sheathing a rapier bowed and passed coldly out

They met twelve hours later in a little hollow two miles from the
hotel on the Stockton road As Mr Oakhurst received his pistol from
Col Starbottles hands he said to him in a low voice Whatever
turns up or down I shall not return to the hotel You will find some
directions in my room Go thereBut his voice suddenly faltered
and he turned his glistening eyes away to his seconds intense
astonishment Ive been out a dozen times with Jack Oakhurst said
Col Starbottle afterward and I never saw him anyways cut before
Blank me if I didnt think he was losing his sand till he walked to
position

The two reports were almost simultaneous Mr Oakhursts right arm
dropped suddenly to his side and his pistol would have fallen from
his paralyzed fingers but the discipline of trained nerve and muscle
prevailed and he kept his grasp until he had shifted it to the other
hand without changing his position Then there was a silence that
seemed interminable a gathering of two or three dark figures where a
smokecurl still lazily floated and then the hurried husky panting
voice of Col Starbottle in his ear Hes hit hardthrough the lungs
you must run for it

Jack turned his dark questioning eyes upon his second but did not
seem to listenrather seemed to hear some other voice remoter in the
distance He hesitated and then made a step forward in the direction
of the distant group Then he paused again as the figures separated and
the surgeon came hastily toward him

He would like to speak with you a moment said the man You have
little time to lose I know but he added in a lower voice it is my
duty to tell you he has still less

A look of despair so hopeless in its intensity swept over Mr
Oakhursts usually impassive face that the surgeon started You are
hit he said glancing at Jacks helpless arm

Nothinga mere scratch said Jack hastily Then he added with a
bitter laugh Im not in luck today But come well see what he
wants

His long feverish stride outstripped the surgeons and in another
moment he stood where the dying man laylike most dying menthe one
calm composed central figure of an anxious group Mr Oakhursts face
was less calm as he dropped on one knee beside him and took his
hand I want to speak with this gentleman alone said Hamilton with
something of his old imperious manner as he turned to those about him
When they drew back he looked up in Oakhursts face

Ive something to tell you Jack

His own face was white but not so white as that which Mr Oakhurst
bent over hima face so ghastly with haunting doubts and a hopeless
presentiment of coming evila face so piteous in its infinite
weariness and envy of death that the dying man was touched even in the
languor of dissolution with a pang of compassion and the cynical smile
faded from his lips

Forgive me Jack he whispered more feebly for what I have to say I
dont say it in anger but only because it must be said I could not do
my duty to you I could not die contented until you knew it all Its a
miserable business at best all around But it cant be helped now Only
I ought to have fallen by Deckers pistol and not yours

A flush like fire came into Jacks cheek and he would have risen but
Hamilton held him fast

Listen In my pocket you will find two letters Take themthere You
will know the handwriting But promise you will not read them until you
are in a place of safety Promise me

Jack did not speak but held the letters between his fingers as if they
had been burning coals

Promise me said Hamilton faintly

Why asked Oakhurst dropping his friends hand coldly

Because said the dying man with a bitter smilebecausewhen you
have read themyouwillgo backto captureand death

They were his last words He pressed Jacks hand faintly Then his grasp
relaxed and he fell back a corpse

It was nearly ten oclock at night and Mrs Decker reclined languidly
upon the sofa with a novel in her hand while her husband discussed
the politics of the country in the barroom of the hotel It was a
warm night and the French window looking out upon a little balcony was
partly open Suddenly she heard a foot upon the balcony and she raised
her eyes from the book with a slight start The next moment the window
was hurriedly thrust wide and a man entered

Mrs Decker rose to her feet with a little cry of alarm

For Heavens sake Jack are you mad He has only gone for a little
whilehe may return at any moment Come an hour later tomorrow any
time when I can get rid of himbut go now dear at once

Mr Oakhurst walked toward the door bolted it and then faced her
without a word His face was haggard his coatsleeve hung loosely over
an arm that was bandaged and bloody

Nevertheless her voice did not falter as she turned again toward him
What has happened Jack Why are you here

He opened his coat and threw two letters in her lap

To return your lovers letters to kill youand then myself he said
in a voice so low as to be almost inaudible

Among the many virtues of this admirable woman was invincible courage
She did not faint she did not cry out she sat quietly down again
folded her hands in her lap and said calmly

And why should you not

Had she recoiled had she shown any fear or contrition had she essayed
an explanation or apology Mr Oakhurst would have looked upon it as an
evidence of guilt But there is no quality that courage recognizes so
quickly as courage There is no condition that desperation bows before
but desperation And Mr Oakhursts power of analysis was not so keen as
to prevent him from confounding her courage with a moral quality Even
in his fury he could not help admiring this dauntless invalid

Why should you not she repeated with a smile You gave me life
health and happiness Jack You gave me your love Why should you not
take what you have given Go on I am ready

She held out her hands with that same infinite grace of yielding with
which she had taken his own on the first day of their meeting at the
hotel Jack raised his head looked at her for one wild moment dropped
upon his knees beside her and raised the folds of her dress to his
feverish lips But she was too clever not to instantly see her victory
she was too much of a woman with all her cleverness to refrain from
pressing that victory home At the same moment as with the impulse of
an outraged and wounded woman she rose and with an imperious gesture
pointed to the window Mr Oakhurst rose in his turn cast one glance
upon her and without another word passed out of her presence forever

When he had gone she closed the window and bolted it and going to
the chimneypiece placed the letters one by one in the flame of the
candle until they were consumed I would not have the reader think
that during this painful operation she was unmoved Her hand trembled
andnot being a brutefor some minutes perhaps longer she felt very
badly and the corners of her sensitive mouth were depressed When her
husband arrived it was with a genuine joy that she ran to him and
nestled against his broad breast with a feeling of security that
thrilled the honest fellow to the core

But Ive heard dreadful news tonight Elsie said Mr Decker after a
few endearments were exchanged

Dont tell me any thing dreadful dear Im not well tonight she
pleaded sweetly

But its about Mr Oakhurst and Hamilton

Please Mr Decker could not resist the petitionary grace of those
white hands and that sensitive mouth and took her to his arms Suddenly
he said Whats that

He was pointing to the bosom of her white dress Where Mr Oakhurst had
touched her there was a spot of blood

It was nothing she had slightly cut her hand in closing the window it
shut so hard If Mr Decker had remembered to close and bolt the shutter
before he went out he might have saved her this There was such a
genuine irritability and force in this remark that Mr Decker was quite
overcome by remorse But Mrs Decker forgave him with that graciousness
which I have before pointed out in these pages And with the halo of
that forgiveness and marital confidence still lingering above the pair
with the readers permission we will leave them and return to Mr
Oakhurst

But not for two weeks At the end of that time he walked into his rooms
in Sacramento and in his old manner took his seat at the farotable

Hows your arm Jack asked an incautious player

There was a smile followed the question which however ceased as Jack
looked up quietly at the speaker

It bothers my dealing a little but I can shoot as well with my left

The game was continued in that decorous silence which usually
distinguished the table at which Mr John Oakhurst presided




WAN LEE THE PAGAN


As I opened Hop Sings letter there fluttered to the ground a square
strip of yellow paper covered with hieroglyphics which at first
glance I innocently took to be the label from a pack of Chinese
firecrackers But the same envelope also contained a smaller strip of
ricepaper with two Chinese characters traced in India ink that I
at once knew to be Hop Sings visitingcard The whole as afterwards
literally translated ran as follows


To the stranger the gates of my house are not closed the ricejar is
on the left and the sweetmeats on the right as you enter

Two sayings of the Master

Hospitality is the virtue of the son and the wisdom of the ancestor

The Superior man is light hearted after the cropgathering he makes a
festival

When the stranger is in your melonpatch observe him not too closely
inattention is often the highest form of civility

Happiness Peace and Prosperity

HOP SING


Admirable certainly as was this morality and proverbial wisdom and
although this last axiom was very characteristic of my friend Hop Sing
who was that most sombre of all humorists a Chinese philosopher I must
confess that even after a very free translation I was at a loss to
make any immediate application of the message Luckily I discovered a
third enclosure in the shape of a little note in English and Hop Sings
own commercial hand It ran thus


The pleasure of your company is requested at No  Sacramento Street
on Friday evening at eight oclock A cup of tea at ninesharp

HOP SING


This explained all It meant a visit to Hop Sings warehouse the
opening and exhibition of some rare Chinese novelties and curios a chat
in the back office a cup of tea of a perfection unknown beyond these
sacred precincts cigars and a visit to the Chinese theatre or temple
This was in fact the favorite programme of Hop Sing when he exercised
his functions of hospitality as the chief factor or superintendent of
the Ning Foo Company

At eight oclock on Friday evening I entered the warehouse of Hop Sing
There was that deliciously commingled mysterious foreign odor that I had
so often noticed there was the old array of uncouthlooking objects
the long procession of jars and crockery the same singular blending of
the grotesque and the mathematically neat and exact the same endless
suggestions of frivolity and fragility the same want of harmony in
colors that were each in themselves beautiful and rare Kites in the
shape of enormous dragons and gigantic butterflies kites so ingeniously
arranged as to utter at intervals when facing the wind the cry of a
hawk kites so large as to be beyond any boys power of restraintso
large that you understood why kiteflying in China was an amusement for
adults gods of china and bronze so gratuitously ugly as to be beyond
any human interest or sympathy from their very impossibility jars of
sweetmeats covered all over with moral sentiments from Confucius hats
that looked like baskets and baskets that looked like hats silks so
light that I hesitate to record the incredible number of square yards
that you might pass through the ring on your little fingerthese and
a great many other indescribable objects were all familiar to me I
pushed my way through the dimlylighted warehouse until I reached the
back office or parlor where I found Hop Sing waiting to receive me

Before I describe him I want the average reader to discharge from
his mind any idea of a Chinaman that he may have gathered from the
pantomime He did not wear beautifully scalloped drawers fringed with
little bells I never met a Chinaman who did he did not habitually
carry his forefinger extended before him at right angles with his body
nor did I ever hear him utter the mysterious sentence Ching a ring
a ring chaw nor dance under any provocation He was on the whole
a rather grave decorous handsome gentleman His complexion which
extended all over his head except where his long pigtail grew was
like a very nice piece of glazed brown papermuslin His eyes were black
and bright and his eyelids set at an angle of fifteen degrees his nose
straight and delicately formed his mouth small and his teeth white
and clean He wore a dark blue silk blouse and in the streets on cold
days a short jacket of astrachan fur He wore also a pair of drawers
of blue brocade gathered tightly over his calves and ankles offering
a general sort of suggestion that he had forgotten his trousers that
morning but that so gentlemanly were his manners his friends had
forborne to mention the fact to him His manner was urbane although
quite serious He spoke French and English fluently In brief I doubt
if you could have found the equal of this Pagan shopkeeper among the
Christian traders of San Francisco

There were a few others presenta judge of the Federal Court an
editor a high government official and a prominent merchant After we
had drunk our tea and tasted a few sweetmeats from a mysterious jar
that looked as if it might contain a preserved mouse among its other
nondescript treasures Hop Sing arose and gravely beckoning us to
follow him began to descend to the basement When we got there we were
amazed at finding it brilliantly lighted and that a number of chairs
were arranged in a halfcircle on the asphalt pavement When he had
courteously seated us he said

I have invited you to witness a performance which I can at least
promise you no other foreigners but yourselves have ever seen Wang
the courtjuggler arrived here yesterday morning He has never given a
performance outside of the palace before I have asked him to entertain
my friends this evening He requires no theatre stage accessories or
any confederatenothing more than you see here Will you be pleased to
examine the ground yourselves gentlemen

Of course we examined the premises It was the ordinary basement or
cellar of the San Francisco storehouse cemented to keep out the damp
We poked our sticks into the pavement and rapped on the walls to
satisfy our polite hostbut for no other purpose We were quite content
to be the victims of any clever deception For myself I knew I was
ready to be deluded to any extent and if I had been offered an
explanation of what followed I should have probably declined it

Although I am satisfied that Wangs general performance was the first of
that kind ever given on American soil it has probably since become so
familiar to many of my readers that I shall not bore them with it here
He began by setting to flight with the aid of his fan the usual number
of butterflies made before our eyes of little bits of tissuepaper and
kept them in the air during the remainder of the performance I have a
vivid recollection of the judge trying to catch one that had lit on his
knee and of its evading him with the pertinacity of a living insect
And even at this time Wang still plying his fan was taking chickens
out of hats making oranges disappear pulling endless yards of silk
from his sleeve apparently filling the whole area of the basement with
goods that appeared mysteriously from the ground from his own sleeves
from nowhere He swallowed knives to the ruin of his digestion for years
to come he dislocated every limb of his body he reclined in the air
apparently upon nothing But his crowning performance which I have
never yet seen repeated was the most weird mysterious and astounding
It is my apology for this long introduction my sole excuse for writing
this article and the genesis of this veracious history

He cleared the ground of its encumbering articles for a space of about
fifteen feet square and then invited us all to walk forward and
again examine it We did so gravely There was nothing but the cemented
pavement below to be seen or felt He then asked for the loan of a
handkerchief and as I chanced to be nearest him I offered mine He
took it and spread it open upon the floor Over this he spread a large
square of silk and over this again a large shawl nearly covering the
space he had cleared He then took a position at one of the points of
this rectangle and began a monotonous chant rocking his body to and
fro in time with the somewhat lugubrious air

We sat still and waited Above the chant we could hear the striking
of the city clocks and the occasional rattle of a cart in the street
overhead The absolute watchfulness and expectation the dim mysterious
halflight of the cellar falling in a grewsome way upon the misshapen
bulk of a Chinese deity in the back ground a faint smell of opiumsmoke
mingling with spice and the dreadful uncertainty of what we were really
waiting for sent an uncomfortable thrill down our backs and made us
look at each other with a forced and unnatural smile This feeling was
heightened when Hop Sing slowly rose and without a word pointed with
his finger to the centre of the shawl

There was something beneath the shawl Surelyand something that was
not there before at first a mere suggestion in relief a faint outline
but growing more and more distinct and visible every moment The chant
still continued the perspiration began to roll from the singers face
gradually the hidden object took upon itself a shape and bulk that
raised the shawl in its centre some five or six inches It was now
unmistakably the outline of a small but perfect human figure with
extended arms and legs One or two of us turned pale There was a
feeling of general uneasiness until the editor broke the silence by a
gibe that poor as it was was received with spontaneous enthusiasm
Then the chant suddenly ceased Wang arose and with a quick dexterous
movement stripped both shawl and silk away and discovered sleeping
peacefully upon my handkerchief a tiny Chinese baby

The applause and uproar which followed this revelation ought to have
satisfied Wang even if his audience was a small one it was loud enough
to awaken the babya pretty little boy about a year old looking
like a Cupid cut out of sandalwood He was whisked away almost as
mysteriously as he appeared When Hop Sing returned my handkerchief to
me with a bow I asked if the juggler was the father of the baby No
sabe said the imperturbable Hop Sing taking refuge in that Spanish
form of noncommittalism so common in California

But does he have a new baby for every performance I asked Perhaps
who knowsBut what will become of this oneWhatever you choose
gentlemen replied Hop Sing with a courteous inclination It was born
here you are its godfathers

There were two characteristic peculiarities of any Californian
assemblage in 1856it was quick to take a hint and generous to the
point of prodigality in its response to any charitable appeal No
matter how sordid or avaricious the individual he could not resist the
infection of sympathy I doubled the points of my handkerchief into
a bag dropped a coin into it and without a word passed it to the
judge He quietly added a twentydollar goldpiece and passed it to the
next When it was returned to me it contained over a hundred dollars I
knotted the money in the handkerchief and gave it to Hop Sing

For the baby from its godfathers

But what name said the judge There was a running fire of Erebus
Nox Plutus Terra Cotta Antaeus c Finally the question was
referred to our host

Why not keep his own name he said quietlyWan Lee And he did

And thus was Wan Lee on the night of Friday the 5th of March 1856
born into this veracious chronicle


The last form of The Northern Star for the 19th of July 1865the
only daily paper published in Klamath Countyhad just gone to press
and at three AM I was putting aside my proofs and manuscripts
preparatory to going home when I discovered a letter lying under
some sheets of paper which I must have overlooked The envelope was
considerably soiled it had no postmark but I had no difficulty in
recognizing the hand of my friend Hop Sing I opened it hurriedly and
read as follows


MY DEAR SIRI do not know whether the bearer will suit you but
unless the office of devil in your newspaper is a purely technical
one I think he has all the qualities required He is very quick
active and intelligent understands English better than he speaks it
and makes up for any defect by his habits of observation and imitation
You have only to show him how to do a thing once and he will repeat
it whether it is an offence or a virtue But you certainly know him
already You are one of his godfathers for is he not Wan Lee the
reputed son of Wang the conjurer to whose performances I had the honor
to introduce you But perhaps you have forgotten it

I shall send him with a gang of coolies to Stockton thence by express
to your town If you can use him there you will do me a favor and
probably save his life which is at present in great peril from the
hands of the younger members of your Christian and highlycivilized race
who attend the enlightened schools in San Francisco

He has acquired some singular habits and customs from his experience
of Wangs profession which he followed for some yearsuntil he became
too large to go in a hat or be produced from his fathers sleeve The
money you left with me has been expended on his education He has gone
through the Triliteral Classics but I think without much benefit He
knows but little of Confucius and absolutely nothing of Mencius Owing
to the negligence of his father he associated perhaps too much with
American children

I should have answered your letter before by post but I thought that
Wan Lee himself would be a better messenger for this

Yours respectfully

HOP SING


And this was the longdelayed answer to my letter to Hop Sing But where
was the bearer How was the letter delivered I summoned hastily the
foreman printers and officeboy but without eliciting any thing No
one had seen the letter delivered nor knew any thing of the bearer A
few days later I had a visit from my laundryman Ah Ri

You wantee debbil All lightee me catchee him

He returned in a few moments with a brightlooking Chinese boy about
ten years old with whose appearance and general intelligence I was so
greatly impressed that I engaged him on the spot When the business was
concluded I asked his name

Wan Lee said the boy

What Are you the boy sent out by Hop Sing What the devil do you mean
by not coming here before and how did you deliver that letter

Wan Lee looked at me and laughed Me pitchee in top side window

I did not understand He looked for a moment perplexed and then
snatching the letter out of my hand ran down the stairs After a
moments pause to my great astonishment the letter came flying in the
window circled twice around the room and then dropped gently like
a bird upon my table Before I had got over my surprise Wan Lee
reappeared smiled looked at the letter and then at me said So
John and then remained gravely silent I said nothing further but it
was understood that this was his first official act

His next performance I grieve to say was not attended with equal
success One of our regular papercarriers fell sick and at a pinch
Wan Lee was ordered to fill his place To prevent mistakes he was shown
over the route the previous evening and supplied at about daylight with
the usual number of subscribers copies He returned after an hour
in good spirits and without the papers He had delivered them all he
said

Unfortunately for Wan Lee at about eight oclock indignant subscribers
began to arrive at the office They had received their copies but how
In the form of hardpressed cannonballs delivered by a single shot
and a mere tour de force through the glass of bedroomwindows They had
received them full in the face like a base ball if they happened to be
up and stirring they had received them in quartersheets tucked in at
separate windows they had found them in the chimney pinned against
the door shot through atticwindows delivered in long slips through
convenient keyholes stuffed into ventilators and occupying the same
can with the mornings milk One subscriber who waited for some time
at the officedoor to have a personal interview with Wan Lee then
comfortably locked in my bedroom told me with tears of rage in
his eyes that he had been awakened at five oclock by a most hideous
yelling below his windows that on rising in great agitation he was
startled by the sudden appearance of The Northern Star rolled hard
and bent into the form of a boomerang or EastIndian club that sailed
into the window described a number of fiendish circles in the room
knocked over the light slapped the babys face took him the
subscriber in the jaw and then returned out of the window and
dropped helplessly in the area During the rest of the day wads and
strips of soiled paper purporting to be copies of The Northern Star
of that mornings issue were brought indignantly to the office An
admirable editorial on The Resources of Humboldt County which I had
constructed the evening before and which I had reason to believe
might have changed the whole balance of trade during the ensuing year
and left San Francisco bankrupt at her wharves was in this way lost to
the public

It was deemed advisable for the next three weeks to keep Wan Lee closely
confined to the printingoffice and the purely mechanical part of the
business Here he developed a surprising quickness and adaptability
winning even the favor and good will of the printers and foreman who
at first looked upon his introduction into the secrets of their trade as
fraught with the gravest political significance He learned to set type
readily and neatly his wonderful skill in manipulation aiding him in
the mere mechanical act and his ignorance of the language confining him
simply to the mechanical effort confirming the printers axiom that
the printer who considers or follows the ideas of his copy makes a poor
compositor He would set up deliberately long diatribes against himself
composed by his fellowprinters and hung on his hook as copy and even
such short sentences as Wan Lee is the devils own imp Wan Lee is a
Mongolian rascal and bring the proof to me with happiness beaming from
every tooth and satisfaction shining in his huckleberry eyes

It was not long however before he learned to retaliate on his
mischievous persecutors I remember one instance in which his reprisal
came very near involving me in a serious misunderstanding Our foremans
name was Webster and Wan Lee presently learned to know and recognize
the individual and combined letters of his name It was during a
political campaign and the eloquent and fiery Col Starbottle of
Siskyou had delivered an effective speech which was reported especially
for The Northern Star In a very sublime peroration Col Starbottle
had said In the language of the godlike Webster I repeatand here
followed the quotation which I have forgotten Now it chanced that Wan
Lee looking over the galley after it had been revised saw the name of
his chief persecutor and of course imagined the quotation his After
the form was locked up Wan Lee took advantage of Websters absence to
remove the quotation and substitute a thin piece of lead of the same
size as the type engraved with Chinese characters making a sentence
which I had reason to believe was an utter and abject confession of
the incapacity and offensiveness of the Webster family generally and
exceedingly eulogistic of Wan Lee himself personally

The next mornings paper contained Col Starbottles speech in full
in which it appeared that the godlike Webster had on one occasion
uttered his thoughts in excellent but perfectly enigmatical Chinese The
rage of Col Starbottle knew no bounds I have a vivid recollection of
that admirable man walking into my office and demanding a retraction of
the statement

But my dear sir I asked are you willing to deny over your own
signature that Webster ever uttered such a sentence Dare you deny
that with Mr Websters wellknown attainments a knowledge of Chinese
might not have been among the number Are you willing to submit a
translation suitable to the capacity of our readers and deny upon
your honor as a gentleman that the late Mr Webster ever uttered such a
sentiment If you are sir I am willing to publish your denial

The colonel was not and left highly indignant

Webster the foreman took it more coolly Happily he was unaware
that for two days after Chinamen from the laundries from the gulches
from the kitchens looked in the front officedoor with faces beaming
with sardonic delight that three hundred extra copies of the Star
were ordered for the washhouses on the river He only knew that
during the day Wan Lee occasionally went off into convulsive spasms
and that he was obliged to kick him into consciousness again A week
after the occurrence I called Wan Lee into my office

Wan I said gravely I should like you to give me for my own
personal satisfaction a translation of that Chinese sentence which
my gifted countryman the late godlike Webster uttered upon a public
occasion Wan Lee looked at me intently and then the slightest
possible twinkle crept into his black eyes Then he replied with equal
gravity

Mishtel Webstel he say China boy makee me belly much foolee China
boy makee me heap sick Which I have reason to think was true

But I fear I am giving but one side and not the best of Wan Lees
character As he imparted it to me his had been a hard life He had
known scarcely any childhood he had no recollection of a father or
mother The conjurer Wang had brought him up He had spent the first
seven years of his life in appearing from baskets in dropping out of
hats in climbing ladders in putting his little limbs out of joint in
posturing He had lived in an atmosphere of trickery and deception He
had learned to look upon mankind as dupes of their senses in fine if
he had thought at all he would have been a sceptic if he had been a
little older he would have been a cynic if he had been older still
he would have been a philosopher As it was he was a little imp A
goodnatured imp it was tooan imp whose moral nature had never
been awakenedan imp up for a holiday and willing to try virtue as
a diversion I dont know that he had any spiritual nature He was very
superstitious He carried about with him a hideous little porcelain god
which he was in the habit of alternately reviling and propitiating
He was too intelligent for the commoner Chinese vices of stealing or
gratuitous lying Whatever discipline he practised was taught by his
intellect

I am inclined to think that his feelings were not altogether
unimpressible although it was almost impossible to extract an
expression from him and I conscientiously believe he became attached
to those that were good to him What he might have become under more
favorable conditions than the bondsman of an overworked underpaid
literary man I dont know I only know that the scant irregular
impulsive kindnesses that I showed him were gratefully received He
was very loyal and patient two qualities rare in the average American
servant He was like Malvolio sad and civil with me Only once
and then under great provocation do I remember of his exhibiting any
impatience It was my habit after leaving the office at night to take
him with me to my rooms as the bearer of any supplemental or happy
afterthought in the editorial way that might occur to me before the
paper went to press One night I had been scribbling away past the
usual hour of dismissing Wan Lee and had become quite oblivious of
his presence in a chair near my door when suddenly I became aware of
a voice saying in plaintive accents something that sounded like Chy
Lee

I faced around sternly

What did you say

Me say Chy Lee

Well I said impatiently

You sabe How do John

Yes

You sabe So long John

Yes

Well Chy Lee allee same

I understood him quite plainly It appeared that Chy Lee was a form of
goodnight and that Wan Lee was anxious to go home But an instinct
of mischief which I fear I possessed in common with him impelled
me to act as if oblivious of the hint I muttered something about not
understanding him and again bent over my work In a few minutes I heard
his wooden shoes pattering pathetically over the floor I looked up He
was standing near the door

You no sabe Chy Lee

No I said sternly

You sabe muchee big foolee allee same

And with this audacity upon his lips he fled The next morning
however he was as meek and patient as before and I did not recall his
offence As a probable peaceoffering he blacked all my bootsa duty
never required of himincluding a pair of buff deerskin slippers
and an immense pair of horsemans jackboots on which he indulged his
remorse for two hours

I have spoken of his honesty as being a quality of his intellect rather
than his principle but I recall about this time two exceptions to the
rule I was anxious to get some fresh eggs as a change to the heavy
diet of a miningtown and knowing that Wan Lees countrymen were great
poultryraisers I applied to him He furnished me with them regularly
every morning but refused to take any pay saying that the man did not
sell thema remarkable instance of selfabnegation as eggs were then
worth half a dollar apiece One morning my neighbor Forster dropped in
upon me at breakfast and took occasion to bewail his own ill fortune
as his hens had lately stopped laying or wandered off in the bush Wan
Lee who was present during our colloquy preserved his characteristic
sad taciturnity When my neighbor had gone he turned to me with a
slight chuckle Flostels hensWan Lees hens allee same His
other offence was more serious and ambitious It was a season of great
irregularities in the mails and Wan Lee had heard me deplore the delay
in the delivery of my letters and newspapers On arriving at my office
one day I was amazed to find my table covered with letters evidently
just from the postoffice but unfortunately not one addressed to me
I turned to Wan Lee who was surveying them with a calm satisfaction
and demanded an explanation To my horror he pointed to an empty
mailbag in the corner and said Postman he say No lettee John no
lettee John Postman plentee lie Postman no good Me catchee lettee
last night allee same Luckily it was still early the mails had not
been distributed I had a hurried interview with the postmaster and
Wan Lees bold attempt at robbing the United States mail was finally
condoned by the purchase of a new mailbag and the whole affair thus
kept a secret

If my liking for my little Pagan page had not been sufficient my duty
to Hop Sing was enough to cause me to take Wan Lee with me when I
returned to San Francisco after my two years experience with The
Northern Star I do not think he contemplated the change with pleasure
I attributed his feelings to a nervous dread of crowded public streets
when he had to go across town for me on an errand he always made a
circuit of the outskirts to his dislike for the discipline of the
Chinese and English school to which I proposed to send him to his
fondness for the free vagrant life of the mines to sheer wilfulness
That it might have been a superstitious premonition did not occur to me
until long after

Nevertheless it really seemed as if the opportunity I had long looked
for and confidently expected had comethe opportunity of placing Wan
Lee under gently restraining influences of subjecting him to a life and
experience that would draw out of him what good my superficial care and
illregulated kindness could not reach Wan Lee was placed at the school
of a Chinese missionaryan intelligent and kindhearted clergyman
who had shown great interest in the boy and who better than all had
a wonderful faith in him A home was found for him in the family of a
widow who had a bright and interesting daughter about two years younger
than Wan Lee It was this bright cheery innocent and artless child
that touched and reached a depth in the boys nature that hitherto had
been unsuspected that awakened a moral susceptibility which had lain
for years insensible alike to the teachings of society or the ethics of
the theologian

These few brief monthsbright with a promise that we never saw
fulfilledmust have been happy ones to Wan Lee He worshipped his
little friend with something of the same superstition but without any
of the caprice that he bestowed upon his porcelain Pagan god It was
his delight to walk behind her to school carrying her booksa service
always fraught with danger to him from the little hands of his Caucasian
Christian brothers He made her the most marvellous toys he would cut
out of carrots and turnips the most astonishing roses and tulips he
made lifelike chickens out of melonseeds he constructed fans and
kites and was singularly proficient in the making of dolls paper
dresses On the other hand she played and sang to him taught him a
thousand little prettinesses and refinements only known to girls gave
him a yellow ribbon for his pigtail as best suiting his complexion
read to him showed him wherein he was original and valuable took him
to Sunday school with her against the precedents of the school and
smallwomanlike triumphed I wish I could add here that she effected
his conversion and made him give up his porcelain idol But I am
telling a true story and this little girl was quite content to fill him
with her own Christian goodness without letting him know that he was
changed So they got along very well togetherthis little Christian
girl with her shining cross hanging around her plump white little neck
and this dark little Pagan with his hideous porcelain god hidden away
in his blouse

There were two days of that eventful year which will long be remembered
in San Franciscotwo days when a mob of her citizens set upon and
killed unarmed defenceless foreigners because they were foreigners
and of another race religion and color and worked for what wages they
could get There were some public men so timid that seeing this they
thought that the end of the world had come There were some eminent
statesmen whose names I am ashamed to write here who began to
think that the passage in the Constitution which guarantees civil and
religious liberty to every citizen or foreigner was a mistake But
there were also some men who were not so easily frightened and in
twentyfour hours we had things so arranged that the timid men could
wring their hands in safety and the eminent statesmen utter their
doubts without hurting any body or any thing And in the midst of this I
got a note from Hop Sing asking me to come to him immediately

I found his warehouse closed and strongly guarded by the police against
any possible attack of the rioters Hop Sing admitted me through a
barred grating with his usual imperturbable calm but as it seemed to
me with more than his usual seriousness Without a word he took my
hand and led me to the rear of the room and thence down stairs into
the basement It was dimly lighted but there was something lying on the
floor covered by a shawl As I approached he drew the shawl away with a
sudden gesture and revealed Wan Lee the Pagan lying there dead

Dead my reverend friends deadstoned to death in the streets of San
Francisco in the year of grace 1869 by a mob of halfgrown boys and
Christian schoolchildren

As I put my hand reverently upon his breast I felt something crumbling
beneath his blouse I looked inquiringly at Hop Sing He put his hand
between the folds of silk and drew out something with the first bitter
smile I had ever seen on the face of that Pagan gentleman

It was Wan Lees porcelain god crushed by a stone from the hands of
those Christian iconoclasts




HOW OLD MAN PLUNKETT WENT HOME


I think we all loved him Even after he mismanaged the affairs of the
Amity Ditch Company we commiserated him although most of us were
stockholders and lost heavily I remember that the blacksmith went so
far as to say that them chaps as put that responsibility on the old man
oughter be lynched But the blacksmith was not a stockholder and the
expression was looked upon as the excusable extravagance of a large
sympathizing nature that when combined with a powerful frame was
unworthy of notice At least that was the way they put it Yet I
think there was a general feeling of regret that this misfortune would
interfere with the old mans longcherished plan of going home

Indeed for the last ten years he had been going home He was going
home after a sixmonths sojourn at Monte Flat he was going home after
the first rains he was going home when the rains were over he was
going home when he had cut the timber on Buckeye Hill when there was
pasture on Dows Flat when he struck paydirt on Eureka Hill when the
Amity Company paid its first dividend when the election was over when
he had received an answer from his wife And so the years rolled by the
spring rains came and went the woods of Buckeye Hill were level with
the ground the pasture on Dows Flat grew sear and dry Eureka Hill
yielded its paydirt and swamped its owner the first dividends of the
Amity Company were made from the assessments of stockholders there were
new county officers at Monte Flat his wifes answer had changed into a
persistent question and still old man Plunkett remained

It is only fair to say that he had made several distinct essays toward
going Five years before he had bidden goodby to Monte Hill with much
effusion and handshaking But he never got any farther than the next
town Here he was induced to trade the sorrel colt he was riding for a
bay marea transaction that at once opened to his lively fancy a vista
of vast and successful future speculation A few days after Abner Dean
of Angels received a letter from him stating that he was going to
Visalia to buy horses I am satisfied wrote Plunkett with that
elevated rhetoric for which his correspondence was remarkableI
am satisfied that we are at last developing the real resources
of California The world will yet look to Dows Flat as the great
stockraising centre In view of the interests involved I have deferred
my departure for a month It was two before he again returned to
uspenniless Six months later he was again enabled to start for the
Eastern States and this time he got as far as San Francisco I have
before me a letter which I received a few days after his arrival from
which I venture to give an extract You know my dear boy that I have
always believed that gambling as it is absurdly called is still in its
infancy in California I have always maintained that a perfect system
might be invented by which the game of poker may be made to yield a
certain percentage to the intelligent player I am not at liberty at
present to disclose the system but before leaving this city I intend to
perfect it He seems to have done so and returned to Monte Flat
with two dollars and thirtyseven cents the absolute remainder of his
capital after such perfection

It was not until 1868 that he appeared to have finally succeeded in
going home He left us by the overland routea route which he declared
would give great opportunity for the discovery of undeveloped resources
His last letter was dated Virginia City He was absent three years At
the close of a very hot day in midsummer he alighted from the Wingdam
stage with hair and beard powdered with dust and age There was a
certain shyness about his greeting quite different from his usual
frank volubility that did not however impress us as any accession
of character For some days he was reserved regarding his recent visit
contenting himself with asserting with more or less aggressiveness
that he had always said he was going home and now he had been there
Later he grew more communicative and spoke freely and critically of
the manners and customs of New York and Boston commented on the social
changes in the years of his absence and I remember was very hard upon
what he deemed the follies incidental to a high state of civilization
Still later he darkly alluded to the moral laxity of the higher planes
of Eastern society but it was not long before he completely tore away
the veil and revealed the naked wickedness of New York social life in a
way I even now shudder to recall Vinous intoxication it appeared was
a common habit of the first ladies of the city Immoralities which he
scarcely dared name were daily practised by the refined of both sexes
Niggardliness and greed were the common vices of the rich I have
always asserted he continued that corruption must exist where luxury
and riches are rampant and capital is not used to develop the natural
resources of the country Thank youI will take mine without sugar
It is possible that some of these painful details crept into the local
journals I remember an editorial in The Monte Flat Monitor entitled
The Effete East in which the fatal decadence of New York and New
England was elaborately stated and California offered as a means of
natural salvation Perhaps said The Monitor we might add that
Calaveras County offers superior inducements to the Eastern visitor with
capital

Later he spoke of his family The daughter he had left a child had grown
into beautiful womanhood The son was already taller and larger than his
father and in a playful trial of strength the young rascal
added Plunkett with a voice broken with paternal pride and humorous
objurgation had twice thrown his doting parent to the ground But it
was of his daughter he chiefly spoke Perhaps emboldened by the
evident interest which masculine Monte Flat held in feminine beauty he
expatiated at some length on her various charms and accomplishments and
finally produced her photographthat of a very pretty girlto their
infinite peril But his account of his first meeting with her was so
peculiar that I must fain give it after his own methods which were
perhaps some shades less precise and elegant than his written style

You see boys its always been my opinion that a man oughter be able
to tell his own flesh and blood by instinct Its ten years since Id
seen my Melindy and she was then only seven and about so high So
when I went to New York what did I do Did I go straight to my house
and ask for my wife and daughter like other folks No sir I rigged
myself up as a peddler as a peddler sir and I rung the bell When the
servant came to the door I wanteddont you seeto show the ladies
some trinkets Then there was a voice over the banister says Dont
want any thing send him awaySome nice laces maam smuggled
I says looking up Get out you wretch says she I knew the voice
boys it was my wife sure as a gun Thar wasnt any instinct thar
Maybe the young ladies want somethin I said Did you hear me says
she and with that she jumps forward and I left Its ten years boys
since Ive seen the old woman but somehow when she fetched that leap
I naterally left

He had been standing beside the barhis usual attitudewhen he made
this speech but at this point he half faced his auditors with a look
that was very effective Indeed a few who had exhibited some signs
of scepticism and lack of interest at once assumed an appearance of
intense gratification and curiosity as he went on

Well by hangin round there for a day or two I found out at last it
was to be Melindys birthday next week and that she was goin to have
a big party I tell ye what boys it werent no slouch of a reception
The whole house was bloomin with flowers and blazin with lights and
there was no end of servants and plate and refreshments and fixins

Uncle Joe

Well

Where did they get the money

Plunkett faced his interlocutor with a severe glance I always said
he replied slowly that when I went home Id send on ahead of me a
draft for ten thousand dollars I always said that didnt I Eh And I
said I was goin homeand Ive been home havent I Well

Either there was something irresistibly conclusive in this logic or
else the desire to hear the remainder of Plunketts story was stronger
but there was no more interruption His ready goodhumor quickly
returned and with a slight chuckle he went on

I went to the biggest jewelry shop in town and I bought a pair of
diamond earrings and put them in my pocket and went to the house
What name says the chap who opened the door and he looked like a
cross twixt a restaurant waiter and a parson Skeesicks said I He
takes me in and pretty soon my wife comes sailin into the parlor
and says Excuse me but I dont think I recognize the name She was
mighty polite for I had on a red wig and sidewhiskers A friend of
your husbands from California maam with a present for your daughter
Miss and I made as I had forgot the name But all of a sudden a
voice said Thats too thin and in walked Melindy Its playin it
rather low down father to pretend you dont know your daughters name
aint it now How are you old man And with that she tears off my wig
and whiskers and throws her arms around my neckinstinct sir pure
instinct

Emboldened by the laughter which followed his description of the filial
utterances of Melinda he again repeated her speech with more or less
elaboration joining in with and indeed often leading the hilarity
that accompanied it and returning to it with more or less incoherency
several times during the evening

And so at various times and at various places but chiefly in
barrooms did this Ulysses of Monte Flat recount the story of his
wanderings There were several discrepancies in his statement there was
sometimes considerable prolixity of detail there was occasional change
of character and scenery there was once or twice an absolute change in
the denoument but always the fact of his having visited his wife and
children remained Of course in a sceptical community like that of
Monte Flata community accustomed to great expectation and small
realizationa community wherein to use the local dialect they
got the color and struck hardpan more frequently than any other
miningcampin such a community the fullest credence was not given
to old man Plunketts facts There was only one exception to the
general unbeliefHenry York of Sandy Bar It was he who was always
an attentive listener it was his scant purse that had often furnished
Plunkett with means to pursue his unprofitable speculations it was to
him that the charms of Melinda were more frequently rehearsed it was he
that had borrowed her photograph and it was he that sitting alone in
his little cabin one night kissed that photograph until his honest
handsome face glowed again in the firelight

It was dusty in Monte Flat The ruins of the long dry season were
crumbling everywhere everywhere the dying summer had strewn its red
ashes a foot deep or exhaled its last breath in a red cloud above the
troubled highways The alders and cottonwoods that marked the line of
the watercourses were grimy with dust and looked as if they might
have taken root in the open air The gleaming stones of the parched
watercourses themselves were as dry bones in the valley of death The
dusty sunset at times painted the flanks of the distant hills a dull
coppery hue on other days there was an odd indefinable earthquake
halo on the volcanic cones of the farther coastspurs Again an acrid
resinous smoke from the burning wood on Heavytree Hill smarted the eyes
and choked the free breath of Monte Flat or a fierce wind driving
every thing including the shrivelled summer like a curled leaf before
it swept down the flanks of the Sierras and chased the inhabitants to
the doors of their cabins and shook its red fist in at their windows
And on such a night as this the dust having in some way choked the
wheels of material progress in Monte Flat most of the inhabitants were
gathered listlessly in the gilded barroom of the Moquelumne Hotel
spitting silently at the redhot stove that tempered the mountain winds
to the shorn lambs of Monte Flat and waiting for the rain

Every method known to the Flat of beguiling the time until the advent of
this longlookedfor phenomenon had been tried It is true the methods
were not many being limited chiefly to that form of popular facetiae
known as practical joking and even this had assumed the seriousness
of a businesspursuit Tommy Roy who had spent two hours in digging
a ditch in front of his own door into which a few friends casually
dropped during the evening looked ennuye and dissatisfied The four
prominent citizens who disguised as footpads had stopped the county
treasurer on the Wingdam road were jaded from their playful efforts
next morning The principal physician and lawyer of Monte Flat who had
entered into an unhallowed conspiracy to compel the sheriff of Calaveras
and his posse to serve a writ of ejectment on a grizzly bear feebly
disguised under the name of one Major Ursus who haunted the groves
of Heavytree Hill wore an expression of resigned weariness Even the
editor of The Monte Flat Monitor who had that morning written a
glowing account of a battle with the Wipneck Indians for the benefit
of Eastern readerseven HE looked grave and worn When at last Abner
Dean of Angels who had been on a visit to San Francisco walked into
the room he was of course victimized in the usual way by one or two
apparently honest questions which ended in his answering them and then
falling into the trap of asking another to his utter and complete shame
and mortification but that was all Nobody laughed and Abner
although a victim did not lose his goodhumor He turned quietly on his
tormentors and said

Ive got something better than thatyou know old man Plunkett

Everybody simultaneously spat at the stove and nodded his head

You know he went home three years ago Two or three changed the
position of their legs from the backs of different chairs and one man
said Yes

Had a good time home

Everybody looked cautiously at the man who had said Yes and he
accepting the responsibility with a fainthearted smile said Yes
again and breathed hard Saw his wife and childpurty gal said
Abner cautiously Yes answered the man doggedly Saw her photograph
perhaps continued Abner Dean quietly

The man looked hopelessly around for support Two or three who had been
sitting near him and evidently encouraging him with a look of interest
now shamelessly abandoned him and looked another way Henry York flushed
a little and veiled his gray eyes The man hesitated and then with a
sickly smile that was intended to convey the fact that he was perfectly
aware of the object of this questioning and was only humoring it from
abstract good feeling returned Yes again

Sent homelets seeten thousand dollars wasnt it Abner Dean went
on Yes reiterated the man with the same smile

Well I thought so said Abner quietly But the fact is you see
that he never went home at allnary time

Everybody stared at Abner in genuine surprise and interest as with
provoking calmness and a halflazy manner he went on

You see thar was a man down in Frisco as knowed him and saw him in
Sonora during the whole of that three years He was herding sheep or
tending cattle or spekilating all that time and hadnt a red cent
Well it mounts to thisthat ar Plunkett aint been east of the Rocky
Mountains since 49

The laugh which Abner Dean had the right to confidently expect came
but it was bitter and sardonic I think indignation was apparent in the
minds of his hearers It was felt for the first time that there was
a limit to practical joking A deception carried on for a year
compromising the sagacity of Monte Flat was deserving the severest
reprobation Of course nobody had believed Plunkett but then the
supposition that it might be believed in adjacent camps that they
HAD believed him was gall and bitterness The lawyer thought that an
indictment for obtaining money under false pretences might be found The
physician had long suspected him of insanity and was not certain but
that he ought to be confined The four prominent merchants thought that
the businessinterests of Monte Flat demanded that something should be
done In the midst of an excited and angry discussion the door slowly
opened and old man Plunkett staggered into the room

He had changed pitifully in the last six months His hair was a dusty
yellowish gray like the chemisal on the flanks of Heavytree Hill his
face was waxen white and blue and puffy under the eyes his clothes
were soiled and shabby streaked in front with the stains of
hurriedly eaten luncheons and fluffy behind with the wool and hair of
hurriedlyextemporized couches In obedience to that odd law that the
more seedy and soiled a mans garments become the less does he seem
inclined to part with them even during that portion of the twentyfour
hours when they are deemed less essential Plunketts clothes had
gradually taken on the appearance of a kind of a bark or an outgrowth
from within for which their possessor was not entirely responsible
Howbeit as he entered the room he attempted to button his coat over
a dirty shirt and passed his fingers after the manner of some animal
over his crackerstrewn beard in recognition of a cleanly public
sentiment But even as he did so the weak smile faded from his
lips and his hand after fumbling aimlessly around a button dropped
helplessly at his side For as he leaned his back against the bar and
faced the group he for the first time became aware that every eye but
one was fixed upon him His quick nervous apprehension at once leaped
to the truth His miserable secret was out and abroad in the very air
about him As a last resort he glanced despairingly at Henry York but
his flushed face was turned toward the windows

No word was spoken As the barkeeper silently swung a decanter and
glass before him he took a cracker from a dish and mumbled it with
affected unconcern He lingered over his liquor until its potency
stiffened his relaxed sinews and dulled the nervous edge of his
apprehension and then he suddenly faced around It dont look as if we
were goin to hev any rain much afore Christmas he said with defiant
ease

No one made any reply

Just like this in 52 and again in 60 Its always been my opinion
that these dry seasons come reglar Ive said it afore I say it again
Its jist as I said about going home you know he added with desperate
recklessness

Thars a man said Abner Dean lazily ez sez you never went home
Thars a man ez sez youve been three years in Sonora Thars a man ez
sez you haint seen your wife and daughter since 49 Thars a man ez
sez youve been playin this camp for six months

There was a dead silence Then a voice said quite as quietly

That man lies

It was not the old mans voice Everybody turned as Henry York slowly
rose stretching out his six feet of length and brushing away the
ashes that had fallen from his pipe upon his breast deliberately placed
himself beside Plunkett and faced the others

That man aint here continued Abner Dean with listless indifference
of voice and a gentle preoccupation of manner as he carelessly
allowed his right hand to rest on his hip near his revolver That man
aint here but if Im called upon to make good what he says why Im
on hand

All rose as the two menperhaps the least externally agitated of them
allapproached each other The lawyer stepped in between them

Perhaps theres some mistake here York do you KNOW that the old man
has been home

Yes

How do you know it

York turned his clear honest frank eyes on his questioner and without
a tremor told the only direct and unmitigated lie of his life Because
Ive seen him there

The answer was conclusive It was known that York had been visiting the
East during the old mans absence The colloquy had diverted attention
from Plunkett who pale and breathless was staring at his unexpected
deliverer As he turned again toward his tormentors there was something
in the expression of his eye that caused those that were nearest to him
to fall back and sent a strange indefinable thrill through the boldest
and most reckless As he made a step forward the physician almost
unconsciously raised his hand with a warning gesture and old man
Plunkett with his eyes fixed upon the redhot stove and an odd smile
playing about his mouth began

Yesof course you did Who says you didnt It aint no lie I said I
was goin homeand Ive been home Havent I My God I have Who says
Ive been lyin Who says Im dreamin Is it truewhy dont you speak
It is true after all You say you saw me there why dont you speak
again Say sayis it true Its going now O my God its going
again Its going now Save me And with a fierce cry he fell forward
in a fit upon the floor

When the old man regained his senses he found himself in Yorks cabin
A flickering fire of pineboughs lit up the rude rafters and fell upon
a photograph tastefully framed with fircones and hung above the brush
whereon he lay It was the portrait of a young girl It was the first
object to meet the old mans gaze and it brought with it a flush of
such painful consciousness that he started and glanced quickly around
But his eyes only encountered those of Yorkclear gray critical and
patientand they fell again

Tell me old man said York not unkindly but with the same cold
clear tone in his voice that his eye betrayed a moment agotell me
is THAT a lie too and he pointed to the picture

The old man closed his eyes and did not reply Two hours before the
question would have stung him into some evasion or bravado But the
revelation contained in the question as well as the tone of Yorks
voice was to him now in his pitiable condition a relief It was
plain even to his confused brain that York had lied when he had
indorsed his story in the barroom it was clear to him now that he had
not been home that he was not as he had begun to fear going mad
It was such a relief that with characteristic weakness his former
recklessness and extravagance returned He began to chuckle finally to
laugh uproariously

York with his eyes still fixed on the old man withdrew the hand with
which he had taken his

Didnt we fool em nicely eh Yorky He he The biggest thing yet
ever played in this camp I always said Id play em all some day and
I haveplayed em for six months Aint it richaint it the richest
thing you ever seed Did you see Abners face when he spoke bout that
man as seed me in Sonora Warnt it good as the minstrels Oh its too
much and striking his leg with the palm of his hand he almost
threw himself from the bed in a paroxysm of laughtera paroxysm that
nevertheless appeared to be half real and half affected

Is that photograph hers said York in a low voice after a slight
pause

Hers No Its one of the San Francisco actresses He he Dont you
see I bought it for two bits in one of the bookstores I never thought
theyd swaller THAT too but they did Oh but the old man played em
this time didnt heeh and he peered curiously in Yorks face

Yes and he played ME too said York looking steadily in the old
mans eye

Yes of course interposed Plunkett hastily but you know Yorky you
got out of it well Youve sold em too Weve both got em on a string
nowyou and megot to stick together now You did it well Yorky you
did it well Why when you said youd seen me in York City Im dd
if I didnt

Didnt what said York gently for the old man had stopped with a pale
face and wandering eye

Eh

You say when I said I had seen you in New York you thought

You lie said the old man fiercely I didnt say I thought any thing
What are you trying to go back on me for eh His hands were trembling
as he rose muttering from the bed and made his way toward the hearth

Gimme some whiskey he said presently and dry up You oughter treat
anyway Them fellows oughter treated last night By hookey Id made
emonly I fell sick

York placed the liquor and a tin cup on the table beside him and
going to the door turned his back upon his guest and looked out on the
night Although it was clear moonlight the familiar prospect never to
him seemed so dreary The dead waste of the broad Wingdam highway never
seemed so monotonous so like the days that he had passed and were to
come to him so like the old man in its suggestion of going sometime
and never getting there He turned and going up to Plunkett put his
hand upon his shoulder and said

I want you to answer one question fairly and squarely

The liquor seemed to have warmed the torpid blood in the old mans
veins and softened his acerbity for the face he turned up to York was
mellowed in its rugged outline and more thoughtful in expression as he
said

Go on my boy

Have you a wife anddaughter

Before God I have

The two men were silent for a moment both gazing at the fire Then
Plunkett began rubbing his knees slowly

The wife if it comes to that aint much he began cautiously being
a little on the shoulder you know and wantin so to speak a liberal
California education which makes you know a bad combination Its
always been my opinion that there aint any worse Why shes as
ready with her tongue as Abner Dean is with his revolver only with
the difference that she shoots from principle as she calls it and the
consequence is shes always layin for you Its the effete East my
boy thats ruinin her Its them ideas she gets in New York and Boston
thats made her and me what we are I dont mind her havin em if she
didnt shoot But havin that propensity them principles oughtnt to
be lying round loose no moren firearms

But your daughter said York

The old mans hands went up to his eyes here and then both hands and
head dropped forward on the table Dont say any thing bout her my
boy dont ask me now With one hand concealing his eyes he fumbled
about with the other in his pockets for his handkerchiefbut vainly
Perhaps it was owing to this fact that he repressed his tears for
when he removed his hand from his eyes they were quite dry Then he
found his voice

Shes a beautiful girl beautiful though I say it and you shall see
her my boyyou shall see her sure Ive got things about fixed now
I shall have my plan for reducin ores perfected a day or two and
Ive got proposals from all the smeltin works here here he hastily
produced a bundle of papers that fell upon the floor and Im goin
to send for em Ive got the papers here as will give me ten thousand
dollars clear in the next month he added as he strove to collect the
valuable documents again Ill have em here by Christmas if I live
and you shall eat your Christmas dinner with me York my boyyou
shall sure

With his tongue now fairly loosened by liquor and the suggestive
vastness of his prospects he rambled on more or less incoherently
elaborating and amplifying his plans occasionally even speaking of them
as already accomplished until the moon rode high in the heavens and
York led him again to his couch Here he lay for some time muttering
to himself until at last he sank into a heavy sleep When York had
satisfied himself of the fact he gently took down the picture and
frame and going to the hearth tossed them on the dying embers and
sat down to see them burn

The fircones leaped instantly into flame then the features that had
entranced San Francisco audiences nightly flashed up and passed away
as such things are apt to pass and even the cynical smile on Yorks
lips faded too And then there came a supplemental and unexpected flash
as the embers fell together and by its light York saw a paper upon
the floor It was one that had fallen from the old mans pocket As he
picked it up listlessly a photograph slipped from its folds It was the
portrait of a young girl and on its reverse was written in a scrawling
hand Melinda to father

It was at best a cheap picture but ah me I fear even the deft
graciousness of the highest art could not have softened the rigid
angularities of that youthful figure its selfcomplacent vulgarity its
cheap finery its expressionless illfavor York did not look at it a
second time He turned to the letter for relief

It was misspelled it was unpunctuated it was almost illegible it
was fretful in tone and selfish in sentiment It was not I fear even
original in the story of its woes It was the harsh recital of poverty
of suspicion of mean makeshifts and compromises of low pains and lower
longings of sorrows that were degrading of a grief that was pitiable
Yet it was sincere in a certain kind of vague yearning for the presence
of the degraded man to whom it was writtenan affection that was more
like a confused instinct than a sentiment

York folded it again carefully and placed it beneath the old mans
pillow Then he returned to his seat by the fire A smile that had been
playing upon his face deepening the curves behind his mustache and
gradually overrunning his clear gray eyes presently faded away It was
last to go from his eyes and it left there oddly enough to those who
did not know him a tear

He sat there for a long time leaning forward his head upon his hands
The wind that had been striving with the canvas roof all at once lifted
its edges and a moonbeam slipped suddenly in and lay for a moment
like a shining blade upon his shoulder and knighted by its touch
straightway plain Henry York arose sustained highpurposed and
selfreliant


The rains had come at last There was already a visible greenness on the
slopes of Heavytree Hill and the long white track of the Wingdam road
was lost in outlying pools and ponds a hundred rods from Monte Flat The
spent watercourses whose white bones had been sinuously trailed over
the flat like the vertebrae of some forgotten saurian were full again
the dry bones moved once more in the valley and there was joy in the
ditches and a pardonable extravagance in the columns of The Monte Flat
Monitor Never before in the history of the county has the yield
been so satisfactory Our contemporary of The Hillside Beacon who
yesterday facetiously alluded to the fact  that our best citizens
were leaving town in dugouts on account of the flood will be glad
to hear that our distinguished fellowtownsman Mr Henry York now on a
visit to his relatives in the East lately took with him in his dugout
the modest sum of fifty thousand dollars the result of one weeks
cleanup We can imagine continued that sprightly journal that no
such misfortune is likely to overtake Hillside this season And yet we
believe The Beacon man wants a railroad A few journals broke out
into poetry The operator at Simpsons Crossing telegraphed to The
Sacramento Universe All day the low clouds have shook their garnered
fulness down A San Francisco journal lapsed into noble verse thinly
disguised as editorial prose Rejoice the gentle rain has come the
bright and pearly rain which scatters blessings on the hills and sifts
them oer the plain Rejoice c Indeed there was only one to whom
the rain had not brought blessing and that was Plunkett In some
mysterious and darksome way it had interfered with the perfection of
his new method of reducing ores and thrown the advent of that invention
back another season It had brought him down to an habitual seat in the
barroom where to heedless and inattentive ears he sat and discoursed
of the East and his family

No one disturbed him Indeed it was rumored that some funds had been
lodged with the landlord by a person or persons unknown whereby his
few wants were provided for His maniafor that was the charitable
construction which Monte Flat put upon his conductwas indulged even
to the extent of Monte Flats accepting his invitation to dine with his
family on Christmas Dayan invitation extended frankly to every one
with whom the old man drank or talked But one day to everybodys
astonishment he burst into the barroom holding an open letter in his
hand It read as follows


Be ready to meet your family at the new cottage on Heavytree Hill on
Christmas Day Invite what friends you choose

HENRY YORK


The letter was handed round in silence The old man with a look
alternating between hope and fear gazed in the faces of the group
The doctor looked up significantly after a pause Its a forgery
evidently he said in a low voice Hes cunning enough to conceive it
they always are but youll find hell fail in executing it Watch his
faceOld man he said suddenly in a loud peremptory tone this is
a trick a forgery and you know it Answer me squarely and look me in
the eye Isnt it so

The eyes of Plunkett stared a moment and then dropped weakly Then
with a feebler smile he said Youre too many for me boys The Docs
right The little games up You can take the old mans hat and so
tottering trembling and chuckling he dropped into silence and his
accustomed seat But the next day he seemed to have forgotten this
episode and talked as glibly as ever of the approaching festivity

And so the days and weeks passed until Christmasa bright clear day
warmed with south winds and joyous with the resurrection of springing
grassesbroke upon Monte Flat And then there was a sudden commotion in
the hotel barroom and Abner Dean stood beside the old mans chair
and shook him out of a slumber to his feet Rouse up old man York is
here with your wife and daughter at the cottage on Heavytree Come
old man Here boys give him a lift and in another moment a dozen
strong and willing hands had raised the old man and bore him in triumph
to the street up the steep grade of Heavytree Hill and deposited him
struggling and confused in the porch of a little cottage At the same
instant two women rushed forward but were restrained by a gesture from
Henry York The old man was struggling to his feet With an effort at
last he stood erect trembling his eye fixed a gray pallor on his
cheek and a deep resonance in his voice

Its all a trick and a lie They aint no flesh and blood or kin o
mine It aint my wife nor child My daughters a beautiful girla
beautiful girl dye hear Shes in New York with her mother and Im
going to fetch her here I said Id go home and Ive been home dye
hear me Ive been home Its a mean trick youre playin on the old
man Let me go dye hear Keep them women off me Let me go Im
goingIm goinghome

His hands were thrown up convulsively in the air and half turning
round he fell sideways on the porch and so to the ground They picked
him up hurriedly but too late He had gone home




THE FOOL OF FIVE FORKS


He lived alone I do not think this peculiarity arose from any wish to
withdraw his foolishness from the rest of the camp nor was it probable
that the combined wisdom of Five Forks ever drove him into exile My
impression is that he lived alone from choicea choice he made long
before the camp indulged in any criticism of his mental capacity He was
much given to moody reticence and although to outward appearances a
strong man was always complaining of illhealth Indeed one theory of
his isolation was that it afforded him better opportunities for taking
medicine of which he habitually consumed large quantities

His folly first dawned upon Five Forks through the postoffice windows
He was for a long time the only man who wrote home by every mail his
letters being always directed to the same persona woman Now it so
happened that the bulk of the Five Forks correspondence was usually the
other way There were many letters received the majority being in
the female hand but very few answered The men received them
indifferently or as a matter of course A few opened and read them on
the spot with a barely repressed smile of selfconceit or quite as
frequently glanced over them with undisguised impatience Some of the
letters began with My dear husband and some were never called for
But the fact that the only regular correspondent of Five Forks never
received any reply became at last quite notorious Consequently when
an envelope was received bearing the stamp of the dead letter office
addressed to The Fool under the more conventional title of Cyrus
Hawkins there was quite a fever of excitement I do not know how the
secret leaked out but it was eventually known to the camp that the
envelope contained Hawkinss own letters returned This was the first
evidence of his weakness Any man who repeatedly wrote to a woman who
did not reply must be a fool I think Hawkins suspected that his folly
was known to the camp but he took refuge in symptoms of chills and
fever which he at once developed and effected a diversion with three
bottles of Indian cholagogue and two boxes of pills At all events at
the end of a week he resumed a pen stiffened by tonics with all his
old epistolatory pertinacity This time the letters had a new address

In those days a popular belief obtained in the mines that luck
particularly favored the foolish and unscientific Consequently when
Hawkins struck a pocket in the hillside near his solitary cabin there
was but little surprise He will sink it all in the next hole was
the prevailing belief predicated upon the usual manner in which the
possessor of nigger luck disposed of his fortune To everybodys
astonishment Hawkins after taking out about eight thousand dollars
and exhausting the pocket did not prospect for another The camp
then waited patiently to see what he would do with his money I think
however that it was with the greatest difficulty their indignation was
kept from taking the form of a personal assault when it became known
that he had purchased a draft for eight thousand dollars in favor of
that woman More than this it was finally whispered that the draft
was returned to him as his letters had been and that he was ashamed
to reclaim the money at the expressoffice It wouldnt be a bad
specilation to go East get some smart gal for a hundred dollars to
dress herself up and represent that Hag and jest freeze onto that
eight thousand suggested a farseeing financier I may state here
that we always alluded to Hawkinss fair unknown as the Hag without
having I am confident the least justification for that epithet

That the Fool should gamble seemed eminently fit and proper That he
should occasionally win a large stake according to that popular theory
which I have recorded in the preceding paragraph appeared also a not
improbable or inconsistent fact That he should however break the faro
bank which Mr John Hamlin had set up in Five Forks and carry off a
sum variously estimated at from ten to twenty thousand dollars and
not return the next day and lose the money at the same table really
appeared incredible Yet such was the fact A day or two passed without
any known investment of Mr Hawkinss recentlyacquired capital Ef he
allows to send it to that Hag said one prominent citizen suthin
ought to be done Its jest ruinin the reputation of this yer
campthis sloshin around o capital on nonresidents ez dont claim
it Its settin an example o extravagance said another ez is
little better nor a swindle Thais morn five men in this camp thet
hearin thet Hawkins hed sent home eight thousand dollars must jest
rise up and send home their hard earnings too And then to think thet
thet eight thousand was only a bluff after all and thet its lyin
there on call in Adams  Cos bank Well I say its one o them things
a vigilance committee oughter look into

When there seemed no possibility of this repetition of Hawkinss folly
the anxiety to know what he had really done with his money became
intense At last a selfappointed committee of four citizens dropped
artfully but to outward appearances carelessly upon him in his
seclusion When some polite formalities had been exchanged and some
easy vituperation of a backward season offered by each of the parties
Tom Wingate approached the subject

Sorter dropped heavy on Jack Hamlin the other night didnt ye He
allows you didnt give him no show for revenge I said you wasnt
no such dd fool didnt I Dick continued the artful Wingate
appealing to a confederate

Yes said Dick promptly You said twenty thousand dollars wasnt
goin to be thrown around recklessly You said Cyrus had suthin better
to do with his capital superadded Dick with gratuitous mendacity I
disremember now what partickler investment you said he was goin to make
with it he continued appealing with easy indifference to his friend

Of course Wingate did not reply but looked at the Fool who with
a troubled face was rubbing his legs softly After a pause he turned
deprecatingly toward his visitors

Ye didnt enny of ye ever hev a sort of tremblin in your legs a
kind o shakiness from the knee down Suthin he continued slightly
brightening with his topicsuthin that begins like chills and
yet aint chills A kind o sensation of goneness here and a kind o
feelin as it you might die suddintwhen Wrights Pills dont somehow
reach the spot and quinine dont fetch you

No said Wingate with a curt directness and the air of
authoritatively responding for his friendsno never had You was
speakin of this yer investment

And your bowels all the time irregular continued Hawkins blushing
under Wingates eye and yet clinging despairingly to his theme like a
shipwrecked mariner to his plank

Wingate did not reply but glanced significantly at the rest Hawkins
evidently saw this recognition of his mental deficiency and said
apologetically You was saying suthin about my investment

Yes said Wingate so rapidly as to almost take Hawkinss breath
awaythe investment you made in

Raffertys Ditch said the Fool timidly

For a moment the visitors could only stare blankly at each other
Raffertys Ditch the one notorious failure of Five ForksRaffertys
Ditch the impracticable scheme of an utterly unpractical
manRaffertys Ditch a ridiculous plan for taking water that could
not be got to a place where it wasnt wantedRaffertys Ditch that
had buried the fortunes of Rafferty and twenty wretched stockholders in
its muddy depths

And thets it is it said Wingate after a gloomy pause Thets it
I see it all now boys Thats how ragged Pat Rafferty went down to San
Francisco yesterday in storeclothes and his wife and four children
went off in a kerridge to Sacramento Thets why them ten workmen of
his ez hadnt a cent to bless themselves with was playin billiards
last night and eatin isters Thets whar that money kum frumone
hundred dollars to pay for the long advertisement of the new issue of
ditch stock in the Times yesterday Thets why them six strangers
were booked at the Magnolia hotel yesterday Dont you see Its thet
moneyand that Fool

The Fool sat silent The visitors rose without a word

You never took any of them Indian Vegetable Pills asked Hawkins
timidly of Wingate

No roared Wingate as he opened the door

They tell me that took with the Panaceathey was out o the Panacea
when I went to the drugstore last weekthey say that took with the
Panacea they always effect a certin cure But by this time Wingate
and his disgusted friends had retreated slamming the door on the Fool
and his ailments

Nevertheless in six months the whole affair was forgotten the money
had been spent the Ditch had been purchased by a company of Boston
capitalists fired by the glowing description of an Eastern tourist who
had spent one drunken night at Five Forks and I think even the mental
condition of Hawkins might have remained undisturbed by criticism but
for a singular incident

It was during an exciting political campaign when partyfeeling ran
high that the irascible Capt McFadden of Sacramento visited Five
Forks During a heated discussion in the Prairie Rose Saloon words
passed between the captain and the Hon Calhoun Bungstarter ending in
a challenge The captain bore the infelicitous reputation of being
a notorious duellist and a deadshot The captain was unpopular The
captain was believed to have been sent by the opposition for a deadly
purpose and the captain was moreover a stranger I am sorry to say
that with Five Forks this latter condition did not carry the quality
of sanctity or reverence that usually obtains among other nomads There
was consequently some little hesitation when the captain turned upon
the crowd and asked for some one to act as his friend To everybodys
astonishment and to the indignation of many the Fool stepped
forward and offered himself in that capacity I do not know
whether Capt McFadden would have chosen him voluntarily but he was
constrained in the absence of a better man to accept his services

The duel never took place The preliminaries were all arranged the
spot indicated the men were present with their seconds there was
no interruption from without there was no explanation or apology
passedbut the duel did not take place It may be readily imagined
that these facts which were all known to Five Forks threw the whole
community into a fever of curiosity The principals the surgeon and
one second left town the next day Only the Fool remained HE resisted
all questioning declaring himself held in honor not to divulge in
short conducted himself with consistent but exasperating folly It was
not until six months had passed that Col Starbottle the second of
Calhoun Bungstarter in a moment of weakness superinduced by the social
glass condescended to explain I should not do justice to the parties
if I did not give that explanation in the colonels own words I may
remark in passing that the characteristic dignity of Col Starbottle
always became intensified by stimulants and that by the same process
all sense of humor was utterly eliminated

With the understanding that I am addressing myself confidentially to
men of honor said the colonel elevating his chest above the barroom
counter of the Prairie Rose Saloon I trust that it will not be
necessary for me to protect myself from levity as I was forced to do in
Sacramento on the only other occasion when I entered into an explanation
of this delicate affair byerercalling the individual to a personal
accounter I do not believe added the colonel slightly waving
his glass of liquor in the air with a graceful gesture of courteous
deprecation knowing what I do of the present company that such a
course of action is required here Certainly not sir in the home of
Mr Hawkinserthe gentleman who represented Mr Bungstarter whose
conduct ged sir is worthy of praise blank me

Apparently satisfied with the gravity and respectful attention of his
listeners Col Starbottle smiled relentingly and sweetly closed his
eyes halfdreamily as if to recall his wandering thoughts and began

As the spot selected was nearest the tenement of Mr Hawkins it was
agreed that the parties should meet there They did so promptly at
halfpast six The morning being chilly Mr Hawkins extended the
hospitalities of his house with a bottle of Bourbon whiskey of which
all partook but myself The reason for that exception is I believe
well known It is my invariable custom to take brandya wineglassful
in a cup of strong coffeeimmediately on rising It stimulates the
functions sir without producing any blank derangement of the nerves

The barkeeper to whom as an expert the colonel had graciously
imparted this information nodded approvingly and the colonel amid a
breathless silence went on

We were about twenty minutes in reaching the spot The ground was
measured the weapons were loaded when Mr Bungstarter confided to me
the information that he was unwell and in great pain On consultation
with Mr Hawkins it appeared that his principal in a distant part of
the field was also suffering and in great pain The symptoms were
such as a medical man would pronounce choleraic I say WOULD
have pronounced for on examination the surgeon was also found to
beerin pain and I regret to say expressing himself in language
unbecoming the occasion His impression was that some powerful drug
had been administered On referring the question to Mr Hawkins he
remembered that the bottle of whiskey partaken by them contained a
medicine which he had been in the habit of taking but which having
failed to act upon him he had concluded to be generally ineffective
and had forgotten His perfect willingness to hold himself personally
responsible to each of the parties his genuine concern at the
disastrous effect of the mistake mingled with his own alarm at the
state of his system whicherfailed toerrespond to the peculiar
qualities of the medicine was most becoming to him as a man of honor
and a gentleman After an hours delay both principals being completely
exhausted and abandoned by the surgeon who was unreasonably alarmed
at his own condition Mr Hawkins and I agreed to remove our men to
Markleville There after a further consultation with Mr Hawkins an
amicable adjustment of all difficulties honorable to both parties
and governed by profound secrecy was arranged I believe added the
colonel looking around and setting down his glass no gentleman has
yet expressed himself other than satisfied with the result

Perhaps it was the colonels manner but whatever was the opinion of
Five Forks regarding the intellectual display of Mr Hawkins in this
affair there was very little outspoken criticism at the moment In a
few weeks the whole thing was forgotten except as part of the necessary
record of Hawkinss blunders which was already a pretty full one
Again some later follies conspired to obliterate the past until a
year later a valuable lead was discovered in the Blazing Star tunnel
in the hill where he lived and a large sum was offered him for a
portion of his land on the hilltop Accustomed as Five Forks had become
to the exhibition of his folly it was with astonishment that they
learned that he resolutely and decidedly refused the offer The reason
that he gave was still more astoundinghe was about to build

To build a house upon property available for miningpurposes was
preposterous to build at all with a roof already covering him was
an act of extravagance to build a house of the style he proposed was
simply madness

Yet here were facts The plans were made and the lumber for the new
building was already on the ground while the shaft of the Blazing
Star was being sunk below The site was in reality a very picturesque
one the building itself of a style and quality hitherto unknown in
Five Forks The citizens at first sceptical during their moments of
recreation and idleness gathered doubtingly about the locality Day by
day in that climate of rapid growths the building pleasantly known
in the slang of Five Forks as the Idiot Asylum rose beside the green
oaks and clustering firs of Hawkins Hill as if it were part of the
natural phenomena At last it was completed Then Mr Hawkins proceeded
to furnish it with an expensiveness and extravagance of outlay quite in
keeping with his former idiocy Carpets sofas mirrors and finally a
pianothe only one known in the county and brought at great expense
from Sacramentokept curiosity at a feverheat More than that there
were articles and ornaments which a few married experts declared only
fit for women When the furnishing of the house was completeit had
occupied two months of the speculative and curious attention of the
campMr Hawkins locked the frontdoor put the key in his pocket and
quietly retired to his more humble roof lower on the hillside

I have not deemed it necessary to indicate to the intelligent reader all
of the theories which obtained in Five Forks during the erection of the
building Some of them may be readily imagined That the Hag had by
artful coyness and systematic reticence at last completely subjugated
the Fool and that the new house was intended for the nuptial bower of
the predestined unhappy pair was of course the prevailing opinion
But when after a reasonable time had elapsed and the house still
remained untenanted the more exasperating conviction forced itself upon
the general mind that the Fool had been for the third time imposed
upon when two months had elapsed and there seemed no prospect of
a mistress for the new houseI think public indignation became so
strong that had the Hag arrived the marriage would have been
publicly prevented But no one appeared that seemed to answer to this
idea of an available tenant and all inquiry of Mr Hawkins as to his
intention in building a house and not renting it or occupying it
failed to elicit any further information The reasons that he gave were
felt to be vague evasive and unsatisfactory He was in no hurry to
move he said When he WAS ready it surely was not strange that he
should like to have his house all ready to receive him He was often
seen upon the veranda of a summer evening smoking a cigar It is
reported that one night the house was observed to be brilliantly lighted
from garret to basement that a neighbor observing this crept toward
the open parlorwindow and looking in espied the Fool accurately
dressed in evening costume lounging upon a sofa in the drawingroom
with the easy air of socially entertaining a large party
Notwithstanding this the house was unmistakably vacant that evening
save for the presence of the owner as the witness afterward testified
When this story was first related a few practical men suggested the
theory that Mr Hawkins was simply drilling himself in the elaborate
duties of hospitality against a probable event in his history A few
ventured the belief that the house was haunted The imaginative editor
of the Five Forks Record evolved from the depths of his professional
consciousness a story that Hawkinss sweetheart had died and that
he regularly entertained her spirit in this beautifully furnished
mausoleum The occasional spectacle of Hawkinss tall figure pacing the
veranda on moonlight nights lent some credence to this theory until an
unlookedfor incident diverted all speculation into another channel

It was about this time that a certain wild rude valley in the
neighborhood of Five Forks had become famous as a picturesque resort
Travellers had visited it and declared that there were more cubic yards
of rough stone cliff and a waterfall of greater height than any they
had visited Correspondents had written it up with extravagant rhetoric
and inordinate poetical quotation Men and women who had never enjoyed a
sunset a tree or a flower who had never appreciated the graciousness
or meaning of the yellow sunlight that flecked their homely doorways
or the tenderness of a midsummers night to whose moonlight they bared
their shirtsleeves or their tulle dresses came from thousands of miles
away to calculate the height of this rock to observe the depth of this
chasm to remark upon the enormous size of this unsightly tree and to
believe with ineffable selfcomplacency that they really admired
Nature And so it came to pass that in accordance with the tastes or
weaknesses of the individual the more prominent and salient points of
the valley were christened and there was a Lace Handkerchief Fall
and the Tears of Sympathy Cataract and one distinguished orators
Peak and several Mounts of various noted people living or dead
and an ExclamationPoint and a Valley of Silent Adoration And in
course of time empty sodawater bottles were found at the base of the
cataract and greasy newspapers and fragments of hamsandwiches lay
at the dusty roots of giant trees With this there were frequent
irruptions of closelyshaven and tightlycravated men and delicate
flowerfaced women in the one long street of Five Forks and a
scampering of mules and an occasional procession of dusty brownlinen

A year after Hawkinss Idiot Asylum was completed one day there
drifted into the valley a riotous cavalcade of schoolmarms
teachers of the San Francisco public schools out for a holiday Not
severelyspectacled Minervas and chastely armed and mailed Pallases
but I fear for the security of Five Forks very human charming and
mischievous young women At least so the men thought working in the
ditches and tunnelling on the hillside and when in the interests
of science and the mental advancement of juvenile posterity it was
finally settled that they should stay in Five Forks two or three
days for the sake of visiting the various mines and particularly the
Blazing Star tunnel there was some flutter of masculine anxiety
There was a considerable inquiry for storeclothes a hopeless
overhauling of old and disused raiment and a general demand fox boiled
shirts and the barber

Meanwhile with that supreme audacity and impudent hardihood of the sex
when gregarious the schoolmarms rode through the town admiring openly
the handsome faces and manly figures that looked up from the ditches
or rose behind the cars of ore at the mouths of tunnels Indeed it is
alleged that Jenny Forester backed and supported by seven other equally
shameless young women had openly and publicly waved her handkerchief to
the florid Hercules of Five Forks one Tom Flynn formerly of Virginia
leaving that goodnatured but not overbright giant pulling his blonde
mustaches in bashful amazement

It was a pleasant June afternoon that Miss Milly Arnot principal of the
primary department of one of the public schools of San Francisco having
evaded her companions resolved to put into operation a plan which had
lately sprung up in her courageous and mischiefloving fancy With that
wonderful and mysterious instinct of her sex from whom no secrets of
the affections are hid and to whom all hearts are laid open she had
heard the story of Hawkinss folly and the existence of the Idiot
Asylum Alone on Hawkins Hill she had determined to penetrate its
seclusion Skirting the underbrush at the foot of the hill she managed
to keep the heaviest timber between herself and the Blazing Star
tunnel at its base as well as the cabin of Hawkins halfway up the
ascent until by a circuitous route at last she reached unobserved
the summit Before her rose silent darkened and motionless the
object of her search Here her courage failed her with all the
characteristic inconsequence of her sex A sudden fear of all the
dangers she had safely passedbears tarantulas drunken men and
lizardscame upon her For a moment as she afterward expressed it
she thought she should die With this belief probably she gathered
three large stones which she could hardly lift for the purpose of
throwing a great distance put two hairpins in her mouth and carefully
readjusted with both hands two stray braids of her lovely blueblack
mane which had fallen in gathering the stones Then she felt in the
pockets of her linen duster for her cardcase handkerchief pocketbook
and smellingbottle and finding them intact suddenly assumed an
air of easy ladylike unconcern went up the steps of the veranda
and demurely pulled the front doorbell which she knew would not be
answered After a decent pause she walked around the encompassing
veranda examining the closed shutters of the French windows until she
found one that yielded to her touch Here she paused again to adjust her
coquettish hat by the mirrorlike surface of the long sashwindow that
reflected the full length of her pretty figure And then she opened the
window and entered the room

Although long closed the house had a smell of newness and of fresh
paint that was quite unlike the mouldiness of the conventional
haunted house The bright carpets the cheerful walls the glistening
oilcloths were quite inconsistent with the idea of a ghost With
childish curiosity she began to explore the silent house at first
timidlyopening the doors with a violent push and then stepping
back from the threshold to make good a possible retreatand then more
boldly as she became convinced of her security and absolute loneliness
In one of the chambersthe largestthere were fresh flowers in a vase
evidently gathered that morning and what seemed still more remarkable
the pitchers and ewers were freshly filled with water This obliged Miss
Milly to notice another singular fact namely that the house was free
from dust the one most obtrusive and penetrating visitor of Five Forks
The floors and carpets had been recently swept the chairs and furniture
carefully wiped and dusted If the house WAS haunted it was possessed
by a spirit who had none of the usual indifference to decay and mould
And yet the beds had evidently never been slept in the very springs
of the chair in which she sat creaked stiffly at the novelty the
closetdoors opened with the reluctance of fresh paint and varnish and
in spite of the warmth cleanliness and cheerfulness of furniture and
decoration there was none of the ease of tenancy and occupation As
Miss Milly afterward confessed she longed to tumble things around
and when she reached the parlor or drawingroom again she could hardly
resist the desire Particularly was she tempted by a closed piano that
stood mutely against the wall She thought she would open it just to see
who was the maker That done it would be no harm to try its tone She
did so with one little foot on the soft pedal But Miss Milly was
too good a player and too enthusiastic a musician to stop at
halfmeasures She tried it again this time so sincerely that the
whole house seemed to spring into voice Then she stopped and listened
There was no response the empty rooms seemed to have relapsed into
their old stillness She stepped out on the veranda A woodpecker
recommenced his tapping on an adjacent tree the rattle of a cart in the
rocky gulch below the hill came faintly up No one was to be seen far or
near Miss Milly reassured returned She again ran her fingers over
the keys stopped caught at a melody running in her mind half played
it and then threw away all caution Before five minutes had elapsed
she had entirely forgotten herself and with her linen duster thrown
aside her straw hat flung on the piano her white hands bared and a
black loop of her braided hair hanging upon her shoulder was fairly
embarked upon a flowing sea of musical recollection

She had played perhaps half an hour when having just finished an
elaborate symphony and resting her hands on the keys she heard very
distinctly and unmistakably the sound of applause from without In an
instant the fires of shame and indignation leaped into her cheeks and
she rose from the instrument and ran to the window only in time to
catch sight of a dozen figures in blue and red flannel shirts vanishing
hurriedly through the trees below

Miss Millys mind was instantly made up I think I have already
intimated that under the stimulus of excitement she was not wanting
in courage and as she quietly resumed her gloves hat and duster she
was not perhaps exactly the young person that it would be entirely
safe for the timid embarrassed or inexperienced of my sex to meet
alone She shut down the piano and having carefully reclosed all
the windows and doors and restored the house to its former desolate
condition she stepped from the veranda and proceeded directly to the
cabin of the unintellectual Hawkins that reared its adobe chimney above
the umbrage a quarter of a mile below

The door opened instantly to her impulsive knock and the Fool of
Five Forks stood before her Miss Milly had never before seen the man
designated by this infelicitous title and as he stepped backward
in half courtesy and half astonishment she was for the moment
disconcerted He was tall finely formed and darkbearded Above cheeks
a little hollowed by care and illhealth shone a pair of hazel eyes
very large very gentle but inexpressibly sad and mournful This was
certainly not the kind of man Miss Milly had expected to see yet after
her first embarrassment had passed the very circumstance oddly enough
added to her indignation and stung her wounded pride still more deeply
Nevertheless the arch hypocrite instantly changed her tactics with the
swift intuition of her sex

I have come she said with a dazzling smile infinitely more dangerous
than her former dignified severityI have come to ask your pardon for
a great liberty I have just taken I believe the new house above us on
the hill is yours I was so much pleased with its exterior that I left
my friends for a moment below here she continued artfully with a
slight wave of the hand as if indicating a band of fearless Amazons
without and waiting to avenge any possible insult offered to one of
their number and ventured to enter it Finding it unoccupied as I had
been told I am afraid I had the audacity to sit down and amuse myself
for a few moments at the piano while waiting for my friends

Hawkins raised his beautiful eyes to hers He saw a very pretty girl
with frank gray eyes glistening with excitement with two red slightly
freckled cheeks glowing a little under his eyes with a short scarlet
upperlip turned back like a roseleaf over a little line of white
teeth as she breathed somewhat hurriedly in her nervous excitement He
saw all this calmly quietly and save for the natural uneasiness of a
shy reticent man I fear without a quickening of his pulse

I knowed it he said simply I heerd ye as I kem up

Miss Milly was furious at his grammar his dialect his coolness and
still more at the suspicion that he was an active member of her in
visible elaque

Ah she said still smiling Then I think I heard YOU

I reckon not he interrupted gravely I didnt stay long I found
the boys hanging round the house and I allowed at first Id go in and
kinder warn you but they promised to keep still and you looked so
comfortable and wrapped up in your music that I hadnt the heart to
disturb you and kem away I hope he added earnestly they didnt
let on ez they heerd you They aint a bad lotthem Blazin Star
boysthough theyre a little hard at times But theyd no more hurt
ye then they would aaa cat continued Mr Hawkins blushing with a
faint apprehension of the inelegance of his simile

No no said Miss Milly feeling suddenly very angry with herself
the Fool and the entire male population of Five Forks No I have
behaved foolishly I supposeand if they HAD it would have served me
right But I only wanted to apologize to you Youll find every thing as
you left it Goodday

She turned to go Mr Hawkins began to feel embarrassed Id have asked
ye to sit down he said finally if it hed been a place fit for a
lady I oughter done so enny way I dont know what kept me from it
But I aint well miss Times I get a sort o dumb agerits the
ditches I think missand I dont seem to hev my wits about me

Instantly Miss Arnot was all sympathy her quick womans heart was
touched

Can Ican any thing be done she asked more timidly than she had
before spoken

Nonot onless ye remember suthin about these pills He exhibited a
box containing about half a dozen I forget the directionI dont
seem to remember much any way these times Theyre Joness Vegetable
Compound If yeve ever took em yell remember whether the reglar
dose is eight They aint but six here But perhaps ye never tuk any
he added deprecatingly

No said Miss Milly curtly She had usually a keen sense of the
ludicrous but somehow Mr Hawkinss eccentricity only pained her

Will you let me see you to the foot of the hill he said again after
another embarrassing pause

Miss Arnot felt instantly that such an act would condone her trespass in
the eyes of the world She might meet some of her invisible admirers
or even her companions and with all her erratic impulses she was
nevertheless a woman and did not entirely despise the verdict of
conventionality She smiled sweetly and assented and in another moment
the two were lost in the shadows of the wood

Like many other apparently trivial acts in an uneventful life it was
decisive As she expected she met two or three of her late applauders
whom she fancied looked sheepish and embarrassed she met also her
companions looking for her in some alarm who really appeared astonished
at her escort and she fancied a trifle envious of her evident
success I fear that Miss Arnot in response to their anxious inquiries
did not state entirely the truth but without actual assertion led
them to believe that she had at a very early stage of the proceeding
completely subjugated this weakminded giant and had brought him
triumphantly to her feet From telling this story two or three times
she got finally to believing that she had some foundation for it then
to a vague sort of desire that it would eventually prove to be true and
then to an equally vague yearning to hasten that consummation That
it would redound to any satisfaction of the Fool she did not stop
to doubt That it would cure him of his folly she was quite confident
Indeed there are very few of us men or women who do not believe that
even a hopeless love for ourselves is more conducive to the salvation of
the lover than a requited affection for another

The criticism of Five Forks was as the reader may imagine swift and
conclusive When it was found out that Miss Arnot was not the Hag
masquerading as a young and pretty girl to the ultimate deception of
Five Forks in general and the Fool in particular it was at once
decided that nothing but the speedy union of the Fool and the pretty
schoolmarm was consistent with ordinary common sense The singular
goodfortune of Hawkins was quite in accordance with the theory of his
luck as propounded by the camp That after the Hag failed to make
her appearance he should strike a lead in his own house without the
trouble of prospectin seemed to these casuists as a wonderful but
inevitable law To add to these fateful probabilities Miss Arnot fell
and sprained her ankle in the ascent of Mount Lincoln and was confined
for some weeks to the hotel after her companions had departed During
this period Hawkins was civilly but grotesquely attentive When after
a reasonable time had elapsed there still appeared to be no immediate
prospect of the occupancy of the new house public opinion experienced a
singular change in regard to its theories of Mr Hawkinss conduct The
Hag was looked upon as a saintlike and longsuffering martyr to the
weaknesses and inconsistency of the Fool That after erecting this
new house at her request he had suddenly gone back on her that his
celibacy was the result of a long habit of weak proposal and subsequent
shameless rejection and that he was now trying his hand on the helpless
schoolmarm was perfectly plain to Five Forks That he should be
frustrated in his attempts at any cost was equally plain Miss Milly
suddenly found herself invested with a rude chivalry that would have
been amusing had it not been at times embarrassing that would have
been impertinent but for the almost superstitious respect with which
it was proffered Every day somebody from Five Forks rode out to inquire
the health of the fair patient Hez Hawkins bin over yer today
queried Tom Flynn with artful ease and indifference as he leaned over
Miss Millys easychair on the veranda Miss Milly with a faint pink
flush on her cheek was constrained to answer No Well he sorter
sprained his foot agin a rock yesterday continued Flynn with shameless
untruthfulness You musnt think any thing o that Miss Arnot Hell
be over yer tomorrer and meantime he told me to hand this yer bookay
with his regards and this yer specimen And Mr Flynn laid down the
flowers he had picked en route against such an emergency and presented
respectfully a piece of quartz and gold which he had taken that morning
from his own sluicebox You musnt mind Hawkinss ways Miss Milly
said another sympathizing miner There aint a better man in camp than
that theer Cy Hawkinsbut he dont understand the ways o the world
with wimen He hasnt mixed as much with society as the rest of us he
added with an elaborate Chesterfieldian ease of manner but he means
well Meanwhile a few other sympathetic tunnelmen were impressing upon
Mr Hawkins the necessity of the greatest attention to the invalid It
wont do Hawkins they explained to let that there gal go back to
San Francisco and say that when she was sick and alone the only man
in Five Forks under whose roof she had rested and at whose table she
had sat this was considered a natural but pardonable exaggeration of
rhetoric ever threw off on her and it shant be done It aint the
square thing to Five Forks And then the Fool would rush away to the
valley and be received by Miss Milly with a certain reserve of manner
that finally disappeared in a flush of color some increased vivacity
and a pardonable coquetry And so the days passed Miss Milly grew
better in health and more troubled in mind and Mr Hawkins became more
and more embarrassed and Five Forks smiled and rubbed its hands
and waited for the approaching denoument And then it camebut not
perhaps in the manner that Five Forks had imagined

It was a lovely afternoon in July that a party of Eastern tourists rode
into Five Forks They had just done the Valley of Big Things and
there being one or two Eastern capitalists among the party it
was deemed advisable that a proper knowledge of the practical
miningresources of California should be added to their experience
of the merely picturesque in Nature Thus far every thing had been
satisfactory the amount of water which passed over the Fall was large
owing to a backward season some snow still remained in the canyons near
the highest peaks they had ridden round one of the biggest trees and
through the prostrate trunk of another To say that they were delighted
is to express feebly the enthusiasm of these ladies and gentlemen drunk
with the champagny hospitality of their entertainers the utter novelty
of scene and the dry exhilarating air of the valley One or two had
already expressed themselves ready to live and die there another had
written a glowing account to the Eastern press depreciating all other
scenery in Europe and America and under these circumstances it was
reasonably expected that Five Forks would do its duty and equally
impress the stranger after its own fashion

Letters to this effect were sent from San Francisco by prominent
capitalists there and under the able superintendence of one of their
agents the visitors were taken in hand shown what was to be seen
carefully restrained from observing what ought not to be visible and so
kept in a blissful and enthusiastic condition And so the graveyard of
Five Forks in which but two of the occupants had died natural deaths
the dreary ragged cabins on the hillsides with their sadeyed
cynical brokenspirited occupants toiling on day by day for a
miserable pittance and a fare that a selfrespecting Eastern mechanic
would have scornfully rejectedwere not a part of the Eastern
visitors recollection But the hoisting works and machinery of the
Blazing Star Tunnel Company wasthe Blazing Star Tunnel Company
whose gentlemanly superintendent had received private information
from San Francisco to do the proper thing for the party Wherefore the
valuable heaps of ore in the companys works were shown the oblong bars
of gold ready for shipment were playfully offered to the ladies who
could lift and carry them away unaided and even the tunnel itself
gloomy fateful and peculiar was shown as part of the experience and
in the noble language of one correspondent The wealth of Five Forks
and the peculiar inducements that it offered to Eastern capitalists
were established beyond a doubt And then occurred a little incident
which as an unbiassed spectator I am free to say offered no
inducements to anybody whatever but which for its bearing upon the
central figure of this veracious chronicle I cannot pass over

It had become apparent to one or two more practical and soberminded in
the party that certain portions of the Blazing Star tunnel owing
perhaps to the exigencies of a flattering annual dividend were
economically and imperfectly shored and supported and were
consequently unsafe insecure and to be avoided Nevertheless at a
time when champagne corks were popping in dark corners and enthusiastic
voices and happy laughter rang through the halflighted levels and
galleries there came a sudden and mysterious silence A few lights
dashed swiftly by in the direction of a distant part of the gallery
and then there was a sudden sharp issuing of orders and a dull ominous
rumble Some of the visitors turned pale one woman fainted

Something had happened What Nothing the speaker is fluent but
uneasyone of the gentlemen in trying to dislodge a specimen
from the wall had knocked away a support There had been a cavethe
gentleman was caught and buried below his shoulders It was all right
theyd get him out in a momentonly it required great care to keep from
extending the cave Didnt know his name It was that little man the
husband of that lively lady with the black eyes Eh Hullo there Stop
her For Gods sake Not that way Shell fall from that shaft Shell
be killed

But the lively lady was already gone With staring black eyes
imploringly trying to pierce the gloom with hands and feet that sought
to batter and break down the thick darkness with incoherent cries and
supplications following the moving of ignis fatuus lights ahead she
ran and ran swiftlyran over treacherous foundations ran by
yawning gulfs ran past branching galleries and arches ran wildly ran
despairingly ran blindly and at last ran into the arms of the Fool of
Five Forks

In an instant she caught at his hand Oh save him she cried You
belong here you know this dreadful place bring me to him Tell me
where to go and what to do I implore you Quick he is dying Come

He raised his eyes to hers and then with a sudden cry dropped the
rope and crowbar he was carrying and reeled against the wall

Annie he gasped slowly Is it you

She caught at both his hands brought her face to his with staring eyes
murmured Good God Cyrus and sank upon her knees before him

He tried to disengage the hand that she wrung with passionate entreaty

No no Cyrus you will forgive meyou will forget the past God has
sent you here today You will come with me You willyou mustsave
him

Save who cried Cyrus hoarsely

My husband

The blow was so direct so strong and overwhelming that even through
her own stronger and more selfish absorption she saw it in the face of
the man and pitied him

I thoughtyouknewit she faltered

He did not speak but looked at her with fixed dumb eyes And then
the sound of distant voices and hurrying feet started her again into
passionate life She once more caught his hand

O Cyrus hear me If you have loved me through all these years you
will not fail me now You must save him You can You are brave and
strongyou always were Cyrus You will save him Cyrus for my sake
for the sake of your love for me You willI know it God bless you

She rose as if to follow him but at a gesture of command she stood
still He picked up the rope and crowbar slowly and in a dazed blinded
way that in her agony of impatience and alarm seemed protracted
to cruel infinity Then he turned and raising her hand to his lips
kissed it slowly looked at her again and the next moment was gone

He did not return for at the end of the next halfhour when they laid
before her the halfconscious breathing body of her husband safe and
unharmed but for exhaustion and some slight bruises she learned that
the worst fears of the workmen had been realized In releasing him a
second cave had taken place They had barely time to snatch away the
helpless body of her husband before the strong frame of his rescuer
Cyrus Hawkins was struck and smitten down in his place

For two hours he lay there crushed and brokenlimbed with a heavy beam
lying across his breast in sight of all conscious and patient For two
hours they had labored around him wildly despairingly hopefully with
the wills of gods and the strength of giants and at the end of that
time they came to an upright timber which rested its base upon the
beam There was a cry for axes and one was already swinging in the air
when the dying man called to them feebly

Dont cut that upright

Why

It will bring down the whole gallery with it

How

Its one of the foundations of my house

The axe fell from the workmans hand and with a blanched face he turned
to his fellows It was too true They were in the uppermost gallery and
the cave had taken place directly below the new house After a pause
the Fool spoke again more feebly

The ladyquick

They brought hera wretched fainting creature with pallid face and
streaming eyesand fell back as she bent her face above him

It was built for you Annie darling he said in a hurried whisper
and has been waiting up there for you and me all these long days Its
deeded to you Annie and you mustlive therewith HIM He will not
mind that I shall be always near you for it stands abovemy grave

And he was right In a few minutes later when he had passed away they
did not move him but sat by his body all night with a torch at his feet
and head And the next day they walled up the gallery as a vault but
they put no mark or any sign thereon trusting rather to the monument
that bright and cheerful rose above him in the sunlight of the hill
And those who heard the story said This is not an evidence of death
and gloom and sorrow as are other monuments but is a sign of life and
light and hope wherefore shall all know that he who lies under it is
what men calla fool




BABY SYLVESTER


It was at a little miningcamp in the California Sierras that he first
dawned upon me in all his grotesque sweetness

I had arrived early in the morning but not in time to intercept the
friend who was the object of my visit He had gone prospectingso
they told me on the riverand would not probably return until late
in the afternoon They could not say what direction he had taken they
could not suggest that I would be likely to find him if I followed But
it was the general opinion that I had better wait

I looked around me I was standing upon the bank of the river
and apparently the only other human beings in the world were my
interlocutors who were even then just disappearing from my horizon
down the steep bank toward the rivers dry bed I approached the edge
of the bank

Where could I wait

Oh anywheredown with them on the riverbar where they were working
if I liked Or I could make myself at home in any of those cabins that
I found lying round loose Or perhaps it would be cooler and pleasanter
for me in my friends cabin on the hill Did I see those three large
sugarpines and a little to the right a canvas roof and chimney
over the bushes Well that was my friendsthat was Dick Sylvesters
cabin I could stake my horse in that little hollow and just hang round
there till he came I would find some books in the shanty I could amuse
myself with them or I could play with the baby

Do what

But they had already gone I leaned over the bank and called after
their vanishing figuresWhat did you say I could do The answer
floated slowly up on the hot sluggish air

Plaay with the baby

The lazy echoes took it up and tossed it languidly from hill to hill
until Bald Mountain opposite made some incoherent remark about the baby
and then all was still

I must have been mistaken My friend was not a man of family there
was not a woman within forty miles of the river camp he never was so
passionately devoted to children as to import a luxury so expensive I
must have been mistaken

I turned my horses head toward the hill As we slowly climbed the
narrow trail the little settlement might have been some exhumed
Pompeiian suburb so deserted and silent were its habitations The open
doors plainly disclosed each rudelyfurnished interiorthe rough pine
table with the scant equipage of the morning meal still standing the
wooden bunk with its tumbled and dishevelled blankets A golden lizard
the very genius of desolate stillness had stopped breathless upon the
threshold of one cabin a squirrel peeped impudently into the window
of another a woodpecker with the general flavor of undertaking
which distinguishes that bird withheld his sepulchral hammer from the
coffinlid of the roof on which he was professionally engaged as
we passed For a moment I half regretted that I had not accepted the
invitation to the riverbed but the next moment a breeze swept up the
long dark canyon and the waiting files of the pines beyond bent toward
me in salutation I think my horse understood as well as myself
that it was the cabins that made the solitude human and therefore
unbearable for he quickened his pace and with a gentle trot brought
me to the edge of the wood and the three pines that stood like vedettes
before the Sylvester outpost

Unsaddling my horse in the little hollow I unslung the long riata from
the saddlebow and tethering him to a young sapling turned toward the
cabin But I had gone only a few steps when I heard a quick trot behind
me and poor Pomposo with every fibre tingling with fear was at my
heels I looked hurriedly around The breeze had died away and only
an occasional breath from the deepchested woods more like a long sigh
than any articulate sound or the dry singing of a cicala in the
heated canyon were to be heard I examined the ground carefully for
rattlesnakes but in vain Yet here was Pomposo shivering from his
arched neck to his sensitive haunches his very flanks pulsating with
terror I soothed him as well as I could and then walked to the edge
of the wood and peered into its dark recesses The bright flash of a
birds wing or the quick dart of a squirrel was all I saw I confess
it was with something of superstitious expectation that I again turned
towards the cabin A fairychild attended by Titania and her train
lying in an expensive cradle would not have surprised me a Sleeping
Beauty whose awakening would have repeopled these solitudes with life
and energy I am afraid I began to confidently look for and would have
kissed without hesitation

But I found none of these Here was the evidence of my friends
taste and refinement in the hearth swept scrupulously clean in the
picturesque arrangement of the furskins that covered the floor and
furniture and the striped serape lying on the wooden couch Here were
the walls fancifully papered with illustrations from The London News
here was the woodcut portrait of Mr Emerson over the chimney quaintly
framed with bluejays wings here were his few favorite books on the
swingingshelf and here lying upon the couch the latest copy of
Punch Dear Dick The floursack was sometimes empty but the gentle
satirist seldom missed his weekly visit

I threw myself on the couch and tried to read But I soon exhausted my
interest in my friends library and lay there staring through the open
door on the green hillside beyond The breeze again sprang up and a
delicious coolness mixed with the rare incense of the woods stole
through the cabin The slumbrous droning of bumblebees outside the
canvas roof the faint cawing of rooks on the opposite mountain and
the fatigue of my morning ride began to droop my eyelids I pulled the
serape over me as a precaution against the freshening mountain breeze
and in a few moments was asleep

I do not remember how long I slept I must have been conscious however
during my slumber of my inability to keep myself covered by the serape
for I awoke once or twice clutching it with a despairing hand as it was
disappearing over the foot of the couch Then I became suddenly aroused
to the fact that my efforts to retain it were resisted by some equally
persistent force and letting it go I was horrified at seeing it
swiftly drawn under the couch At this point I sat up completely awake
for immediately after what seemed to be an exaggerated muff began to
emerge from under the couch Presently it appeared fully dragging the
serape after it There was no mistaking it now it was a babybeara
mere suckling it was true a helpless roll of fat and fur but
unmistakably a grizzly cub

I cannot recall any thing more irresistibly ludicrous than its aspect
as it slowly raised its small wondering eyes to mine It was so
much taller on its haunches than its shoulders its forelegs were so
disproportionately small that in walking its hindfeet invariably
took precedence It was perpetually pitching forward over its pointed
inoffensive nose and recovering itself always after these involuntary
somersaults with the gravest astonishment To add to its preposterous
appearance one of its hindfeet was adorned by a shoe of Sylvesters
into which it had accidentally and inextricably stepped As this
somewhat impeded its first impulse to fly it turned to me and then
possibly recognizing in the stranger the same species as its master it
paused Presently it slowly raised itself on its hindlegs and vaguely
and deprecatingly waved a babypaw fringed with little hooks of steel
I took the paw and shook it gravely From that moment we were friends
The little affair of the serape was forgotten

Nevertheless I was wise enough to cement our friendship by an act
of delicate courtesy Following the direction of his eyes I had no
difficulty in finding on a shelf near the ridgepole the sugarbox and
the square lumps of white sugar that even the poorest miner is never
without While he was eating them I had time to examine him more
closely His body was a silky dark but exquisitelymodulated gray
deepening to black in his paws and muzzle His fur was excessively long
thick and soft as eiderdown the cushions of flesh beneath perfectly
infantine in their texture and contour He was so very young that the
palms of his halfhuman feet were still tender as a babys Except for
the bright blue steely hooks half sheathed in his little toes there
was not a single harsh outline or detail in his plump figure He was as
free from angles as one of Ledas offspring Your caressing hand
sank away in his fur with dreamy languor To look at him long was an
intoxication of the senses to pat him was a wild delirium to embrace
him an utter demoralization of the intellectual faculties

When he had finished the sugar he rolled out of the door with a
halfdiffident halfinviting look in his eyes as if he expected me
to follow I did so but the sniffing and snorting of the keenscented
Pomposo in the hollow not only revealed the cause of his former terror
but decided me to take another direction After a moments hesitation
he concluded to go with me although I am satisfied from a certain
impish look in his eye that he fully understood and rather enjoyed the
fright of Pomposo As he rolled along at my side with a gait not unlike
a drunken sailor I discovered that his long hair concealed a leather
collar around his neck which bore for its legend the single word
Baby I recalled the mysterious suggestion of the two miners This
then was the baby with whom I was to play

How we played how Baby allowed me to roll him down hill crawling
and puffing up again each time with perfect goodhumor how he climbed
a young sapling after my Panama hat which I had shied into one of the
topmost branches how after getting it he refused to descend until it
suited his pleasure how when he did come down he persisted in walking
about on three legs carrying my hat a crushed and shapeless mass
clasped to his breast with the remaining one how I missed him at last
and finally discovered him seated on a table in one of the tenantless
cabins with a bottle of sirup between his paws vainly endeavoring to
extract its contentsthese and other details of that eventful day I
shall not weary the reader with now Enough that when Dick Sylvester
returned I was pretty well fagged out and the baby was rolled up an
immense bolster at the foot of the couch asleep Sylvesters first
words after our greeting were

Isnt he delicious

Perfectly Where did you get him

Lying under his dead mother five miles from here said Dick lighting
his pipe Knocked her over at fifty yards perfectly clean shot never
moved afterwards Baby crawled out scared but unhurt She must have
been carrying him in her mouth and dropped him when she faced me for
he wasnt more than three days old and not steady on his pins He takes
the only milk that comes to the settlement brought up by Adams Express
at seven oclock every morning They say he looks like me Do you
think so asked Dick with perfect gravity stroking his haycolored
mustachios and evidently assuming his best expression

I took leave of the baby early the next morning in Sylvesters
cabin and out of respect to Pomposos feelings rode by without any
postscript of expression But the night before I had made Sylvester
solemnly swear that in the event of any separation between himself and
Baby it should revert to me At the same time he had added its
only fair to say that I dont think of dying just yet old fellow and I
dont know of any thing else that would part the cub and me

Two months after this conversation as I was turning over the mornings
mail at my office in San Francisco I noticed a letter bearing
Sylvesters familiar hand But it was postmarked Stockton and I
opened it with some anxiety at once Its contents were as follows


O FRANKDont you remember what we agreed upon anent the baby Well
consider me as dead for the next six months or gone where cubs cant
follow meEast I know you love the baby but do you think dear
boynow really do you think you COULD be a father to it Consider
this well You are young thoughtless wellmeaning enough but dare you
take upon yourself the functions of guide genius or guardian to one so
young and guileless Could you be the Mentor to this Telemachus Think
of the temptations of a metropolis Look at the question well and
let me know speedily for Ive got him as far as this place and hes
kicking up an awful row in the hotelyard and rattling his chain like a
maniac Let me know by telegraph at once

SYLVESTER

PSOf course hes grown a little and doesnt take things always as
quietly as he did He dropped rather heavily on two of Watsons purps
last week and snatched old Watson himself bald headed for interfering
You remember Watson For an intelligent man he knows very little of
California fauna How are you fixed for bears on Montgomery Street I
mean in regard to corrals and things S

PPSHes got some new tricks The boys have been teaching him to
put up his hands with them He slings an ugly left S


I am afraid that my desire to possess myself of Baby overcame all other
considerations and I telegraphed an affirmative at once to Sylvester
When I reached my lodgings late that afternoon my landlady was awaiting
me with a telegram It was two lines from Sylvester


All right Baby goes down on nightboat Be a father to him S


It was due then at one oclock that night For a moment I was
staggered at my own precipitation I had as yet made no preparations
had said nothing to my landlady about her new guest I expected to
arrange every thing in time and now through Sylvesters indecent
haste that time had been shortened twelve hours

Something however must be done at once I turned to Mrs Brown I
had great reliance in her maternal instincts I had that still greater
reliance common to our sex in the general tenderheartedness of pretty
women But I confess I was alarmed Yet with a feeble smile I tried
to introduce the subject with classical ease and lightness I even said
If Shakspeares Athenian clown Mrs Brown believed that a lion among
ladies was a dreadful thing what mustBut here I broke down for
Mrs Brown with the awful intuition of her sex I saw at once was
more occupied with my manner than my speech So I tried a business
brusquerie and placing the telegram in her hand said hurriedly We
must do something about this at once Its perfectly absurd but he will
be here at one tonight Beg thousand pardons but business prevented my
speaking beforeand paused out of breath and courage

Mrs Brown read the telegram gravely lifted her pretty eyebrows turned
the paper over and looked on the other side and then in a remote and
chilling voice asked me if she understood me to say that the mother was
coming also

Oh dear no I exclaimed with considerable relief The mother is
dead you know Sylvester that is my friend who sent this shot her
when the baby was only three days old But the expression of Mrs
Browns face at this moment was so alarming that I saw that nothing
but the fullest explanation would save me Hastily and I fear not very
coherently I told her all

She relaxed sweetly She said I had frightened her with my talk about
lions Indeed I think my picture of poor Baby albeit a trifle highly
colored touched her motherly heart She was even a little vexed at what
she called Sylvesters hardheartedness Still I was not without some
apprehension It was two months since I had seen him and Sylvesters
vague allusion to his slinging an ugly left pained me I looked at
sympathetic little Mrs Brown and the thought of Watsons pups covered
me with guilty confusion

Mrs Brown had agreed to sit up with me until he arrived One oclock
came but no Baby Two oclock three oclock passed It was almost
four when there was a wild clatter of horses hoofs outside and with
a jerk a wagon stopped at the door In an instant I had opened it and
confronted a stranger Almost at the same moment the horses attempted
to run away with the wagon

The strangers appearance was to say the least disconcerting His
clothes were badly torn and frayed his linen sack hung from his
shoulders like a heralds apron one of his hands was bandaged his face
scratched and there was no hat on his dishevelled head To add to the
general effect he had evidently sought relief from his woes in drink
and he swayed from side to side as he clung to the doorhandle and in
a very thick voice stated that he had suthin for me outside When he
had finished the horses made another plunge

Mrs Brown thought they must be frightened at something

Frightened laughed the stranger with bitter irony Oh no Hossish
aint frightened Ony ran away four timesh comin here Oh no
Nobodys frightened Every thins all ri Aint it Bill he said
addressing the driver Ony been overboard twish knocked down a
hatchway once Thash nothin Ony two men unner doctors hans at
Stockton Thash nothin Six hunner dollarsh cover all dammish

I was too much disheartened to reply but moved toward the wagon The
stranger eyed me with an astonishment that almost sobered him

Do you reckon to tackle that animile yourself he asked as he
surveyed me from head to foot

I did not speak but with an appearance of boldness I was far from
feeling walked to the wagon and called Baby

All ri Cash loose them straps Bill and stan clear

The straps were cut loose and Baby the remorseless the terrible
quietly tumbled to the ground and rolling to my side rubbed his
foolish head against me

I think the astonishment of the two men was beyond any vocal expression
Without a word the drunken stranger got into the wagon and drove away

And Baby He had grown it is true a trifle larger but he was thin
and bore the marks of evident ill usage His beautiful coat was
matted and unkempt and his claws those bright steel hooks had been
ruthlessly pared to the quick His eyes were furtive and restless
and the old expression of stupid good humor had changed to one of
intelligent distrust His intercourse with mankind had evidently
quickened his intellect without broadening his moral nature

I had great difficulty in keeping Mrs Brown from smothering him in
blankets and ruining his digestion with the delicacies of her larder
but I at last got him completely rolled up in the corner of my room and
asleep I lay awake some time later with plans for his future I finally
determined to take him to Oaklandwhere I had built a little cottage
and always spent my Sundaysthe very next day And in the midst of a
rosy picture of domestic felicity I fell asleep

When I awoke it was broad day My eyes at once sought the corner where
Baby had been lying but he was gone I sprang from the bed looked
under it searched the closet but in vain The door was still locked
but there were the marks of his blunted claws upon the sill of the
window that I had forgotten to close He had evidently escaped that way
But where The window opened upon a balcony to which the only other
entrance was through the hall He must be still in the house

My hand was already upon the bellrope but I stayed it in time If he
had not made himself known why should I disturb the house I dressed
myself hurriedly and slipped into the hall The first object that met
my eyes was a boot lying upon the stairs It bore the marks of Babys
teeth and as I looked along the hall I saw too plainly that the usual
array of freshlyblackened boots and shoes before the lodgers doors
was not there As I ascended the stairs I found another but with the
blacking carefully licked off On the third floor were two or three more
boots slightly mouthed but at this point Babys taste for blacking had
evidently palled A little farther on was a ladder leading to an open
scuttle I mounted the ladder and reached the flat roof that formed
a continuous level over the row of houses to the corner of the street
Behind the chimney on the very last roof something was lurking It was
the fugitive Baby He was covered with dust and dirt and fragments of
glass But he was sitting on his hindlegs and was eating an enormous
slab of peanut candy with a look of mingled guilt and infinite
satisfaction He even I fancied slightly stroked his stomach with his
disengaged forepaw as I approached He knew that I was looking for
him and the expression of his eye said plainly The past at least is
secure

I hurried him with the evidences of his guilt back to the scuttle and
descended on tiptoe to the floor beneath Providence favored us I met
no one on the stairs and his own cushioned tread was inaudible I think
he was conscious of the dangers of detection for he even forebore
to breathe or much less chew the last mouthful he had taken and he
skulked at my side with the sirup dropping from his motionless jaws I
think he would have silently choked to death just then for my sake and
it was not until I had reached my room again and threw myself panting
on the sofa that I saw how near strangulation he had been He gulped
once or twice apologetically and then walked to the corner of his
own accord and rolled himself up like an immense sugarplum sweating
remorse and treacle at every pore

I locked him in when I went to breakfast when I found Mrs Browns
lodgers in a state of intense excitement over certain mysterious events
of the night before and the dreadful revelations of the morning It
appeared that burglars had entered the block from the scuttles that
being suddenly alarmed they had quitted our house without committing
any depredation dropping even the boots they had collected in the
halls but that a desperate attempt had been made to force the till in
the confectioners shop on the corner and that the glass showcases had
been ruthlessly smashed A courageous servant in No 4 had seen a masked
burglar on his hands and knees attempting to enter their scuttle but
on her shouting Away wid yees he instantly fled

I sat through this recital with cheeks that burned uncomfortably nor
was I the less embarrassed on raising my eyes to meet Mrs Browns
fixed curiously and mischievously on mine As soon as I could make my
escape from the table I did so and running rapidly up stairs sought
refuge from any possible inquiry in my own room Baby was still asleep
in the corner It would not be safe to remove him until the lodgers had
gone down town and I was revolving in my mind the expediency of keeping
him until night veiled his obtrusive eccentricity from the public eye
when there came a cautious tap at my door I opened it Mrs Brown
slipped in quietly closed the door softly stood with her back against
it and her hand on the knob and beckoned me mysteriously towards her
Then she asked in a low voice

Is hairdye poisonous

I was too confounded to speak

Oh do you know what I mean she said impatiently This stuff She
produced suddenly from behind her a bottle with a Greek label so long
as to run two or three times spirally around it from top to bottom He
says it isnt a dye its a vegetable preparation for invigorating

Who says I asked despairingly

Why Mr Parker of course said Mrs Brown severely with the air of
having repeated the name a great many timesthe old gentleman in the
room above The simple question I want to ask she continued with the
calm manner of one who has just convicted another of gross ambiguity of
language is only this If some of this stuff were put in a saucer and
left carelessly on the table and a child or a baby or a cat or any
young animal should come in at the window and drink it upa whole
saucer fullbecause it had a sweet taste would it be likely to hurt
them

I cast an anxious glance at Baby sleeping peacefully in the corner and
a very grateful one at Mrs Brown and said I didnt think it would

Because said Mrs Brown loftily as she opened the door I thought
if it was poisonous remedies might be used in time Because she added
suddenly abandoning her lofty manner and wildly rushing to the corner
with a frantic embrace of the unconscious Baby because if any nasty
stuff should turn its booful hair a horrid green or a naughty pink it
would break its own muzzers heart it would

But before I could assure Mrs Brown of the inefficiency of hairdye as
an internal application she had darted from the room

That night with the secrecy of defaulters Baby and I decamped from
Mrs Browns Distrusting the too emotional nature of that noble animal
the horse I had recourse to a handcart drawn by a stout Irishman to
convey my charge to the ferry Even then Baby refused to go unless I
walked by the cart and at times rode in it

I wish said Mrs Brown as she stood by the door wrapped in an
immense shawl and saw us depart I wish it looked less solemnless
like a paupers funeral

I must admit that as I walked by the cart that night I felt very much
as if I were accompanying the remains of some humble friend to his last
restingplace and that when I was obliged to ride in it I never could
entirely convince myself that I was not helplessly overcome by liquor
or the victim of an accident en route to the hospital But at last we
reached the ferry On the boat I think no one discovered Baby except a
drunken man who approached me to ask for a light for his cigar but who
suddenly dropped it and fled in dismay to the gentlemens cabin where
his incoherent ravings were luckily taken for the earlier indications of
delirium tremens

It was nearly midnight when I reached my little cottage on the outskirts
of Oakland and it was with a feeling of relief and security that I
entered locked the door and turned him loose in the hall satisfied
that henceforward his depredations would be limited to my own property
He was very quiet that night and after he had tried to mount the
hatrack under the mistaken impression that it was intended for his own
gymnastic exercise and knocked all the hats off he went peaceably to
sleep on the rug

In a week with the exercise afforded him by the run of a large
carefullyboarded enclosure he recovered his health strength spirits
and much of his former beauty His presence was unknown to my neighbors
although it was noticeable that horses invariably shied in passing
to the windward of my house and that the baker and milkman had great
difficulty in the delivery of their wares in the morning and indulged
in unseemly and unnecessary profanity in so doing

At the end of the week I determined to invite a few friends to see the
Baby and to that purpose wrote a number of formal invitations After
descanting at some length on the great expense and danger attending
his capture and training I offered a programme of the performance of
the Infant Phenomenon of Sierran Solitudes drawn up into the highest
professional profusion of alliteration and capital letters A few
extracts will give the reader some idea of his educational progress


1 He will rolled up in a Round Ball roll down the WoodShed Rapidly
illustrating His manner of Escaping from His Enemy in His Native Wilds

2 He will Ascend the WellPole and remove from the Very Top a Hat and
as much of the Crown and Brim thereof as May be Permitted

3 He will perform in a pantomime descriptive of the Conduct of the Big
Bear The MiddleSized Bear and The Little Bear of the Popular Nursery
Legend

4 He will shake his chain Rapidly showing his Manner of striking
Dismay and Terror in the Breasts of Wanderers in Ursine Wildernesses


The morning of the exhibition came but an hour before the performance
the wretched Baby was missing The Chinese cook could not indicate his
whereabouts I searched the premises thoroughly and then in despair
took my hat and hurried out into the narrow lane that led toward the
open fields and the woods beyond But I found no trace nor track of
Baby Sylvester I returned after an hours fruitless search to find
my guests already assembled on the rear veranda I briefly recounted my
disappointment my probable loss and begged their assistance

Why said a Spanish friend who prided himself on his accurate
knowledge of English to Barker who seemed to be trying vainly to rise
from his reclining position on the veranda why do you not disengage
yourself from the veranda of our friend And why in the name of Heaven
do you attach to yourself so much of this thing and make to yourself
such unnecessary contortion Ah he continued suddenly withdrawing one
of his own feet from the veranda with an evident effort I am myself
attached Surely it is something here

It evidently was My guests were all rising with difficulty The floor
of the veranda was covered with some glutinous substance It wassirup

I saw it all in a flash I ran to the barn The keg of golden sirup
purchased only the day before lay empty upon the floor There were
sticky tracks all over the enclosure but still no Baby

Theres something moving the ground over there by that pile of dirt
said Barker

He was right The earth was shaking in one corner of the enclosure like
an earthquake I approached cautiously I saw what I had not before
noticed that the ground was thrown up and there in the middle of an
immense gravelike cavity crouched Baby Sylvester still digging and
slowly but surely sinking from sight in a mass of dust and clay

What were his intentions Whether he was stung by remorse and wished to
hide himself from my reproachful eyes or whether he was simply trying
to dry his sirupbesmeared coat I never shall know for that day alas
was his last with me

He was pumped upon for two hours at the end of which time he still
yielded a thin treacle He was then taken and carefully inwrapped in
blankets and locked up in the storeroom The next morning he was
gone The lower portion of the window sash and pane were gone too
His successful experiments on the fragile texture of glass at the
confectioners on the first day of his entrance to civilization had
not been lost upon him His first essay at combining cause and effect
ended in his escape

Where he went where he hid who captured him if he did not succeed in
reaching the foothills beyond Oakland even the offer of a large reward
backed by the efforts of an intelligent police could not discover I
never saw him again from that day until

Did I see him I was in a horsecar on Sixth Avenue a few days ago
when the horses suddenly became unmanageable and left the track for the
sidewalk amid the oaths and execrations of the driver Immediately in
front of the car a crowd had gathered around two performing bears and a
showman One of the animals thin emaciated and the mere wreck of his
native strength attracted my attention I endeavored to attract his He
turned a pair of bleared sightless eyes in my direction but there was
no sign of recognition I leaned from the carwindow and called softly
Baby But he did not heed I closed the window The car was just
moving on when he suddenly turned and either by accident or design
thrust a callous paw through the glass

Its worth a dollar and half to put in a new pane said the conductor
if folks will play with bears




AN EPISODE OF FIDDLETOWN


In 1858 Fiddletown considered her a very pretty woman She had a
quantity of light chestnut hair a good figure a dazzling complexion
and a certain languid grace which passed easily for gentlewomanliness
She always dressed becomingly and in what Fiddletown accepted as the
latest fashion She had only two blemishes one of her velvety eyes
when examined closely had a slight cast and her left cheek bore a
small scar left by a single drop of vitriolhappily the only drop of
an entire phialthrown upon her by one of her own jealous sex that
reached the pretty face it was intended to mar But when the observer
had studied the eyes sufficiently to notice this defect he was
generally incapacitated for criticism and even the scar on her cheek
was thought by some to add piquancy to her smile The youthful editor
of The Fiddletown Avalanche had said privately that it was an
exaggerated dimple Col Starbottle was instantly reminded of the
beautifying patches of the days of Queen Anne but more particularly
sir of the blankest beautiful women that blank you you ever laid
your two blank eyes upona Creole woman sir in New Orleans And this
woman had a scara line extending blank me from her eye to her
blank chin And this woman sir thrilled you sir maddened you sir
absolutely sent your blank soul to perdition with her blank fascination
And one day I said to her Celeste how in blank did you come by that
beautiful scar blank you And she said to me Star there isnt
another white man that Id confide in but you but I made that scar
myself purposely I did blank me These were her very words sir and
perhaps you think it a blank lie sir but Ill put up any blank sum you
can name and prove it blank me

Indeed most of the male population of Fiddletown were or had been in
love with her Of this number about onehalf believed that their love
was returned with the exception possibly of her own husband He alone
had been known to express scepticism

The name of the gentleman who enjoyed this infelicitous distinction was
Tretherick He had been divorced from an excellent wife to marry this
Fiddletown enchantress She also had been divorced but it was hinted
that some previous experiences of hers in that legal formality had made
it perhaps less novel and probably less sacrificial I would not have
it inferred from this that she was deficient in sentiment or devoid of
its highest moral expression Her intimate friend had written on the
occasion of her second divorce The cold world does not understand
Clara yet and Col Starbottle had remarked blankly that with the
exception of a single woman in Opelousas Parish La she had more soul
than the whole caboodle of them put together Few indeed could read
those lines entitled Infelissimus commencing Why waves no cypress
oer this brow originally published in The Avalanche over the
signature of The Lady Clare without feeling the tear of sensibility
tremble on his eyelids or the glow of virtuous indignation mantle his
cheek at the low brutality and pitiable jocularity of The Dutch Flat
Intelligencer which the next week had suggested the exotic character
of the cypress and its entire absence from Fiddletown as a reasonable
answer to the query

Indeed it was this tendency to elaborate her feelings in a metrical
manner and deliver them to the cold world through the medium of the
newspapers that first attracted the attention of Tretherick Several
poems descriptive of the effects of California scenery upon a too
sensitive soul and of the vague yearnings for the infinite which an
enforced study of the heartlessness of California society produced in
the poetic breast impressed Mr Tretherick who was then driving a
sixmule freightwagon between Knights Ferry and Stockton to seek out
the unknown poetess Mr Tretherick was himself dimly conscious of a
certain hidden sentiment in his own nature and it is possible that
some reflections on the vanity of his pursuithe supplied several
miningcamps with whiskey and tobaccoin conjunction with the
dreariness of the dusty plain on which he habitually drove may have
touched some chord in sympathy with this sensitive woman Howbeit after
a brief courtshipas brief as was consistent with some previous legal
formalitiesthey were married and Mr Tretherick brought his blushing
bride to Fiddletown or Fideletown as Mrs Tretherick preferred to
call it in her poems

The union was not a felicitous one It was not long before Mr
Tretherick discovered that the sentiment he had fostered while
freighting between Stockton and Knights Ferry was different from that
which his wife had evolved from the contemplation of California scenery
and her own soul Being a man of imperfect logic this caused him to
beat her and she being equally faulty in deduction was impelled to
a certain degree of unfaithfulness on the same premise Then Mr
Tretherick began to drink and Mrs Tretherick to contribute regularly
to the columns of The Avalanche It was at this time that Col
Starbottle discovered a similarity in Mrs Trethericks verse to the
genius of Sappho and pointed it out to the citizens of Fiddletown in
a twocolumned criticism signed A S also published in The
Avalanche and supported by extensive quotation As The Avalanche did
not possess a font of Greek type the editor was obliged to reproduce
the Leucadian numbers in the ordinary Roman letter to the intense
disgust of Col Starbottle and the vast delight of Fiddletown who saw
fit to accept the text as an excellent imitation of Choctawa language
with which the colonel as a whilom resident of the Indian Territories
was supposed to be familiar Indeed the next weeks Intelligencer
contained some vile doggerel supposed to be an answer to Mrs
Trethericks poem ostensibly written by the wife of a Digger Indian
chief accompanied by a glowing eulogium signed A S S

The result of this jocularity was briefly given in a later copy of
The Avalanche An unfortunate rencounter took place on Monday last
between the Hon Jackson Flash of The Dutch Flat Intelligencer and the
wellknown Col Starbottle of this place in front of the Eureka saloon
Two shots were fired by the parties without injury to either although
it is said that a passing Chinaman received fifteen buckshot in the
calves of his legs from the colonels doublebarrelled shotgun which
were not intended for him John will learn to keep out of the way of
Melican mans firearms hereafter The cause of the affray is not known
although it is hinted that there is a lady in the case The rumor that
points to a wellknown and beautiful poetess whose lucubrations have
often graced our columns seems to gain credence from those that are
posted

Meanwhile the passiveness displayed by Tretherick under these trying
circumstances was fully appreciated in the gulches The old mans
head is level said one longbooted philosopher Ef the colonel
kills Flash Mrs Tretherick is avenged if Flash drops the colonel
Tretherick is all right Either way hes got a sure thing During
this delicate condition of affairs Mrs Tretherick one day left her
husbands home and took refuge at the Fiddletown Hotel with only the
clothes she had on her back Here she staid for several weeks during
which period it is only justice to say that she bore herself with the
strictest propriety

It was a clear morning in early spring that Mrs Tretherick unattended
left the hotel and walked down the narrow street toward the fringe of
dark pines which indicated the extreme limits of Fiddletown The few
loungers at that early hour were preoccupied with the departure of the
Wingdown coach at the other extremity of the street and Mrs Tretherick
reached the suburbs of the settlement without discomposing observation
Here she took a cross street or road running at right angles with the
main thoroughfare of Fiddletown and passing through a belt of woodland
It was evidently the exclusive and aristocratic avenue of the town The
dwellings were few ambitious and uninterrupted by shops And here she
was joined by Col Starbottle

The gallant colonel notwithstanding that he bore the swelling port
which usually distinguished him that his coat was tightly buttoned and
his boots tightly fitting and that his cane hooked over his arm
swung jauntily was not entirely at his ease Mrs Tretherick however
vouchsafed him a gracious smile and a glance of her dangerous eyes
and the colonel with an embarrassed cough and a slight strut took his
place at her side

The coast is clear said the colonel and Tretherick is over at Dutch
Flat on a spree There is no one in the house but a Chinaman and you
need fear no trouble from him I he continued with a slight inflation
of the chest that imperilled the security of his button I will see
that you are protected in the removal of your property

Im sure its very kind of you and so disinterested simpered the
lady as they walked along Its so pleasant to meet some one who
has soulsome one to sympathize with in a community so hardened and
heartless as this And Mrs Tretherick cast down her eyes but not
until they wrought their perfect and accepted work upon her companion

Yes certainly of course said the colonel glancing nervously up and
down the streetyes certainly Perceiving however that there
was no one in sight or hearing he proceeded at once to inform Mrs
Tretherick that the great trouble of his life in fact had been the
possession of too much soul That many womenas a gentleman she would
excuse him of course from mentioning namesbut many beautiful women
had often sought his society but being deficient madam absolutely
deficient in this quality he could not reciprocate But when two
natures thoroughly in sympathy despising alike the sordid trammels of
a low and vulgar community and the conventional restraints of a
hypocritical societywhen two souls in perfect accord met and mingled
in poetical union thenbut here the colonels speech which had been
remarkable for a certain whiskeyandwatery fluency grew husky almost
inaudible and decidedly incoherent Possibly Mrs Tretherick may have
heard something like it before and was enabled to fill the hiatus
Nevertheless the cheek that was on the side of the colonel was quite
virginal and bashfully conscious until they reached their destination

It was a pretty little cottage quite fresh and warm with paint very
pleasantly relieved against a platoon of pines some of whose foremost
files had been displaced to give freedom to the fenced enclosure in
which it sat In the vivid sunlight and perfect silence it had a new
uninhabited look as if the carpenters and painters had just left it At
the farther end of the lot a Chinaman was stolidly digging but there
was no other sign of occupancy The coast as the colonel had said
was indeed clear Mrs Tretherick paused at the gate The colonel
would have entered with her but was stopped by a gesture Come for me
in a couple of hours and I shall have every thing packed she said
as she smiled and extended her hand The colonel seized and pressed it
with great fervor Perhaps the pressure was slightly returned for the
gallant colonel was impelled to inflate his chest and trip away as
smartly as his stubbytoed highheeled boots would permit When he had
gone Mrs Tretherick opened the door listened a moment in the deserted
hall and then ran quickly up stairs to what had been her bedroom

Every thing there was unchanged as on the night she left it On the
dressingtable stood her bandbox as she remembered to have left it
when she took out her bonnet On the mantle lay the other glove she had
forgotten in her flight The two lower drawers of the bureau were half
open she had forgotten to shut them and on its marble top lay her
shawlpin and a soiled cuff What other recollections came upon her I
know not but she suddenly grew quite white shivered and listened with
a beating heart and her hand upon the door Then she stepped to the
mirror and half fearfully half curiously parted with her fingers the
braids of her blonde hair above her little pink ear until she came upon
an ugly halfhealed scar She gazed at this moving her pretty head
up and down to get a better light upon it until the slight cast in her
velvety eyes became very strongly marked indeed Then she turned away
with a light reckless foolish laugh and ran to the closet where
hung her precious dresses These she inspected nervously and missing
suddenly a favorite black silk from its accustomed peg for a moment
thought she should have fainted But discovering it the next instant
lying upon a trunk where she had thrown it a feeling of thankfulness
to a superior Being who protects the friendless for the first time
sincerely thrilled her Then albeit she was hurried for time she could
not resist trying the effect of a certain lavender neckribbon upon the
dress she was then wearing before the mirror And then suddenly she
became aware of a childs voice close beside her and she stopped And
then the childs voice repeated Is it mamma

Mrs Tretherick faced quickly about Standing in the doorway was a
little girl of six or seven Her dress had been originally fine but was
torn and dirty and her hair which was a very violent red was tumbled
seriocomically about her forehead For all this she was a picturesque
little thing even through whose childish timidity there was a certain
selfsustained air which is apt to come upon children who are left much
to themselves She was holding under her arm a rag doll apparently
of her own workmanship and nearly as large as herselfa doll with a
cylindrical head and features roughly indicated with charcoal A
long shawl evidently belonging to a grown person dropped from her
shoulders and swept the floor

The spectacle did not excite Mrs Trethericks delight Perhaps she had
but a small sense of humor Certainly when the child still standing in
the doorway again asked Is it mamma she answered sharply No it
isnt and turned a severe look upon the intruder

The child retreated a step and then gaining courage with the distance
said in deliciously imperfect speech

Dow way then why dont you dow away

But Mrs Tretherick was eying the shawl Suddenly she whipped it off the
childs shoulders and said angrily

How dared you take my things you bad child

Is it yours Then you are my mamma aint you You are mamma she
continued gleefully and before Mrs Tretherick could avoid her she
had dropped her doll and catching the womans skirts with both hands
was dancing up and down before her

Whats your name child said Mrs Tretherick coldly removing the
small and not very white hands from her garments

Tarry

Tarry

Yeth Tarry Tarowline

Caroline

Yeth Tarowline Tretherick

Whose child ARE you demanded Mrs Tretherick still more coldly to
keep down a rising fear

Why yours said the little creature with a laugh Im your little
durl Youre my mamma my new mamma Dont you know my ole mammas dorn
away never to turn back any more I dont live wid my ol mamma now I
live wid you and papa

How long have you been here asked Mrs Tretherick snappishly

I fink its free days said Carry reflectively

You think Dont you know sneered Mrs Tretherick Then where did
you come from

Carrys lip began to work under this sharp crossexamination With a
great effort and a small gulp she got the better of it and answered

Papa papa fetched mefrom Miss Simmonsfrom Sacramento last week

Last week You said three days just now returned Mrs Tretherick with
severe deliberation

I mean a monf said Carry now utterly adrift in sheer helplessness
and confusion

Do you know what you are talking about demanded Mrs Tretherick
shrilly restraining an impulse to shake the little figure before her
and precipitate the truth by specific gravity

But the flaming red head here suddenly disappeared in the folds of Mrs
Trethericks dress as if it were trying to extinguish itself forever

There nowstop that sniffling said Mrs Tretherick extricating
her dress from the moist embraces of the child and feeling exceedingly
uncomfortable Wipe your face now and run away and dont bother
Stop she continued as Carry moved away Wheres your papa

Hes dorn away too Hes sick Hes been dornshe hesitatedtwo
free days

Who takes care of you child said Mrs Tretherick eying her
curiously

John the Chinaman I tresses myselth John tooks and makes the beds

Well now run away and behave yourself and dont bother me any more
said Mrs Tretherick remembering the object of her visit Stopwhere
are you going she added as the child began to ascend the stairs
dragging the long doll after her by one helpless leg

Doin up stairs to play and be dood and no bother mamma

I aint your mamma shouted Mrs Tretherick and then she swiftly
reentered her bedroom and slammed the door

Once inside she drew forth a large trunk from the closet and set to
work with querulous and fretful haste to pack her wardrobe She tore her
best dress in taking it from the hook on which it hung she scratched
her soft hands twice with an ambushed pin All the while she kept up an
indignant commentary on the events of the past few moments She said to
herself she saw it all Tretherick had sent for this child of his first
wifethis child of whose existence he had never seemed to carejust
to insult her to fill her place Doubtless the first wife herself would
follow soon or perhaps there would be a third Red hair not auburn
but REDof course the child this Caroline looked like its mother
and if so she was any thing but pretty Or the whole thing had been
prepared this redhaired child the image of its mother had been
kept at a convenient distance at Sacramento ready to be sent for when
needed She remembered his occasional visits there onbusiness as he
said Perhaps the mother already was there but no she had gone East
Nevertheless Mrs Tretherick in her then state of mind preferred to
dwell upon the fact that she might be there She was dimly conscious
also of a certain satisfaction in exaggerating her feelings Surely
no woman had ever been so shamefully abused In fancy she sketched
a picture of herself sitting alone and deserted at sunset among
the fallen columns of a ruined temple in a melancholy yet graceful
attitude while her husband drove rapidly away in a luxurious
coachandfour with a redhaired woman at his side Sitting upon
the trunk she had just packed she partly composed a lugubrious poem
describing her sufferings as wandering alone and poorly clad she
came upon her husband and another flaunting in silks and diamonds
She pictured herself dying of consumption brought on by sorrowa
beautiful wreck yet still fascinating gazed upon adoringly by the
editor of The Avalanche and Col Starbottle And where was Col
Starbottle all this while Why didnt he come He at least understood
her Heshe laughed the reckless light laugh of a few moments before
and then her face suddenly grew grave as it had not a few moments
before

What was that little redhaired imp doing all this time Why was she so
quiet She opened the door noiselessly and listened She fancied
that she heard above the multitudinous small noises and creakings
and warpings of the vacant house a smaller voice singing on the floor
above This as she remembered was only an open attic that had been
used as a storeroom With a halfguilty consciousness she crept softly
up stairs and pushing the door partly open looked within

Athwart the long lowstudded attic a slant sunbeam from a single small
window lay filled with dancing motes and only half illuminating the
barren dreary apartment In the ray of this sunbeam she saw the childs
glowing hair as if crowned by a red aureola as she sat upon the floor
with her exaggerated doll between her knees She appeared to be talking
to it and it was not long before Mrs Tretherick observed that she was
rehearsing the interview of a halfhour before She catechised the
doll severely crossexamining it in regard to the duration of its
stay there and generally on the measure of time The imitation of Mrs
Trethericks manner was exceedingly successful and the conversation
almost a literal reproduction with a single exception After she had
informed the doll that she was not her mother at the close of the
interview she added pathetically that if she was dood very dood she
might be her mamma and love her very much

I have already hinted that Mrs Tretherick was deficient in a sense of
humor Perhaps it was for this reason that this whole scene affected
her most unpleasantly and the conclusion sent the blood tingling to her
cheek There was something too inconceivably lonely in the situation
The unfurnished vacant room the halflights the monstrous doll whose
very size seemed to give a pathetic significance to its speechlessness
the smallness of the one animate selfcentred figureall these
touched more or less deeply the halfpoetic sensibilities of the woman
She could not help utilizing the impression as she stood there and
thought what a fine poem might be constructed from this material if the
room were a little darker the child loneliersay sitting beside a
dead mothers bier and the wind wailing in the turrets And then she
suddenly heard footsteps at the door below and recognized the tread of
the colonels cane

She flew swiftly down the stairs and encountered the colonel in the
hall Here she poured into his astonished ear a voluble and exaggerated
statement of her discovery and indignant recital of her wrongs Dont
tell me the whole thing wasnt arranged beforehand for I know it was
she almost screamed And think she added of the heartlessness of
the wretch leaving his own child alone here in that way

Its a blank shame stammered the colonel without the least idea
of what he was talking about In fact utterly unable as he was to
comprehend a reason for the womans excitement with his estimate of
her character I fear he showed it more plainly than he intended He
stammered expanded his chest looked stern gallant tender but
all unintelligently Mrs Tretherick for an instant experienced a
sickening doubt of the existence of natures in perfect affinity

Its of no use said Mrs Tretherick with sudden vehemence in answer
to some inaudible remark of the colonels and withdrawing her hand from
the fervent grasp of that ardent and sympathetic man Its of no use
my mind is made up You can send for my trunk as soon as you like but I
shall stay here and confront that man with the proof of his vileness I
will put him face to face with his infamy

I do not know whether Col Starbottle thoroughly appreciated the
convincing proof of Trethericks unfaithfulness and malignity afforded
by the damning evidence of the existence of Trethericks own child in
his own house He was dimly aware however of some unforeseen obstacle
to the perfect expression of the infinite longing of his own sentimental
nature But before he could say any thing Carry appeared on the
landing above them looking timidly and yet halfcritically at the
pair

Thats her said Mrs Tretherick excitedly In her deepest emotions
either in verse or prose she rose above a consideration of grammatical
construction

Ah said the colonel with a sudden assumption of parental affection
and jocularity that was glaringly unreal and affected Ah pretty
little girl pretty little girl How do you do How are you You find
yourself pretty well do you pretty little girl The colonels impulse
also was to expand his chest and swing his cane until it occurred to
him that this action might be ineffective with a child of six or seven
Carry however took no immediate notice of this advance but
further discomposed the chivalrous colonel by running quickly to Mrs
Tretherick and hiding herself as if for protection in the folds of
her gown Nevertheless the colonel was not vanquished Falling back
into an attitude of respectful admiration he pointed out a marvellous
resemblance to the Madonna and Child Mrs Tretherick simpered but
did not dislodge Carry as before There was an awkward pause for a
moment and then Mrs Tretherick motioning significantly to the child
said in a whisper Go now Dont come here again but meet me
tonight at the hotel She extended her hand the colonel bent over it
gallantly and raising his hat the next moment was gone

Do you think said Mrs Tretherick with an embarrassed voice and a
prodigious blush looking down and addressing the fiery curls just
visible in the folds of her dressdo you think you will be dood if
I let you stay in here and sit with me

And let me tall you mamma queried Carry looking up

And let you call me mamma assented Mrs Tretherick with an
embarrassed laugh

Yeth said Carry promptly

They entered the bedroom together Carrys eye instantly caught sight of
the trunk

Are you dowin away adain mamma she said with a quick nervous look
and a clutch at the womans dress

Noo said Mrs Tretherick looking out of the window

Only playing your dowin away suggested Carry with a laugh Let me
play too

Mrs Tretherick assented Carry flew into the next room and presently
reappeared dragging a small trunk into which she gravely proceeded
to pack her clothes Mrs Tretherick noticed that they were not many A
question or two regarding them brought out some further replies from
the child and before many minutes had elapsed Mrs Tretherick was in
possession of all her earlier history But to do this Mrs Tretherick
had been obliged to take Carry upon her lap pending the most
confidential disclosures They sat thus a long time after Mrs
Tretherick had apparently ceased to be interested in Carrys
disclosures and when lost in thought she allowed the child to rattle
on unheeded and ran her fingers through the scarlet curls

You dont hold me right mamma said Carry at last after one or two
uneasy shiftings of position

How should I hold you asked Mrs Tretherick with a halfamused
halfembarrassed laugh

Dis way said Carry curling up into position with one arm around
Mrs Trethericks neck and her cheek resting on her bosomdis
waydere After a little preparatory nestling not unlike some small
animal she closed her eyes and went to sleep

For a few moments the woman sat silent scarcely daring to breathe in
that artificial attitude And then whether from some occult sympathy in
the touch or God best knows what a sudden fancy began to thrill her
She began by remembering an old pain that she had forgotten an old
horror that she had resolutely put away all these years She recalled
days of sickness and distrustdays of an overshadowing feardays of
preparation for something that was to be prevented that WAS prevented
with mortal agony and fear She thought of a life that might have
beenshe dared not say HAD beenand wondered It was six years ago
if it had lived it would have been as old as Carry The arms which were
folded loosely around the sleeping child began to tremble and tighten
their clasp And then the deep potential impulse came and with a
halfsob halfsigh she threw her arms out and drew the body of the
sleeping child down down into her breast down again and again as if
she would hide it in the grave dug there years before And the gust that
shook her passed and then ah me the rain

A drop or two fell upon the curls of Carry and she moved uneasily in
her sleep But the woman soothed her againit was so easy to do it
nowand they sat there quiet and undisturbed so quiet that they might
have seemed incorporate of the lonely silent house the slowlydeclining
sunbeams and the general air of desertion and abandonment yet a
desertion that had in it nothing of age decay or despair


Col Starbottle waited at the Fiddletown hotel all that night in vain
And the next morning when Mr Tretherick returned to his husks he
found the house vacant and untenanted except by motes and sunbeams

When it was fairly known that Mrs Tretherick had run away taking Mr
Trethericks own child with her there was some excitement and much
diversity of opinion in Fiddletown The Dutch Flat Intelligencer
openly alluded to the forcible abduction of the child with the same
freedom and it is to be feared the same prejudice with which it had
criticised the abductors poetry All of Mrs Trethericks own sex and
perhaps a few of the opposite sex whose distinctive quality was not
however very strongly indicated fully coincided in the views of The
Intelligencer The majority however evaded the moral issue that
Mrs Tretherick had shaken the red dust of Fiddletown from her dainty
slippers was enough for them to know They mourned the loss of the fair
abductor more than her offence They promptly rejected Tretherick as
an injured husband and disconsolate father and even went so far as to
openly cast discredit on the sincerity of his grief They reserved an
ironical condolence for Col Starbottle overbearing that excellent
man with untimely and demonstrative sympathy in barrooms saloons
and other localities not generally deemed favorable to the display
of sentiment She was alliz a skittish thing kernel said one
sympathizer with a fine affectation of gloomy concern and great
readiness of illustration and its kinder natril thet shed get away
some day and stampede that theer colt but thet she should shake YOU
kernel thet she should just shake youis what gits me And they do
say thet you jist hung around thet hotel all night and payrolled them
corriders and histed yourself up and down them stairs and meandered
in and out o thet piazzy and all for nothing It was another generous
and tenderly commiserating spirit that poured additional oil and wine
on the colonels wounds The boys yer let on thet Mrs Tretherick
prevailed on ye to pack her trunk and a baby over from the house to the
stageoffis and that the chap ez did go off with her thanked you and
offered you two short bits and sed ez how he liked your looks and ud
employ you aginand now you say it aint so Well Ill tell the boys
it aint so and Im glad I met you for stories DO get round

Happily for Mrs Trethericks reputation however the Chinaman in
Trethericks employment who was the only eyewitness of her flight
stated that she was unaccompanied except by the child He further
deposed that obeying her orders he had stopped the Sacramento coach
and secured a passage for herself and child to San Francisco It was
true that Ah Fes testimony was of no legal value But nobody doubted
it Even those who were sceptical of the Pagans ability to recognize
the sacredness of the truth admitted his passionless unprejudiced
unconcern But it would appear from a hitherto unrecorded passage of
this veracious chronicle that herein they were mistaken

It was about six months after the disappearance of Mrs Tretherick
that Ah Fe while working in Trethericks lot was hailed by two passing
Chinamen They were the ordinary mining coolies equipped with long
poles and baskets for their usual pilgrimages An animated conversation
at once ensued between Ah Fe and his brother Mongoliansa conversation
characterized by that usual shrill volubility and apparent animosity
which was at once the delight and scorn of the intelligent Caucasian who
did not understand a word of it Such at least was the feeling
with which Mr Tretherick on his veranda and Col Starbottle who was
passing regarded their heathenish jargon The gallant colonel simply
kicked them out of his way the irate Tretherick with an oath threw a
stone at the group and dispersed them but not before one or two slips
of yellow ricepaper marked with hieroglyphics were exchanged and a
small parcel put into Ah Fes hands When Ah Fe opened this in the dim
solitude of his kitchen he found a little girls apron freshly washed
ironed and folded On the corner of the hem were the initials C T
Ah Fe tucked it away in a corner of his blouse and proceeded to wash
his dishes in the sink with a smile of guileless satisfaction

Two days after this Ah Fe confronted his master Me no likee
Fiddletown Me belly sick Me go now Mr Tretherick violently
suggested a profane locality Ah Fe gazed at him placidly and withdrew

Before leaving Fiddletown however he accidentally met Col Starbottle
and dropped a few incoherent phrases which apparently interested that
gentleman When he concluded the colonel handed him a letter and
a twentydollar goldpiece If you bring me an answer Ill double
thatSabe John Ah Fe nodded An interview equally accidental
with precisely the same result took place between Ah Fe and another
gentleman whom I suspect to have been the youthful editor of The
Avalanche Yet I regret to state that after proceeding some distance
on his journey Ah Fe calmly broke the seals of both letters and after
trying to read them upside down and sideways finally divided them into
accurate squares and in this condition disposed of them to a brother
Celestial whom he met on the road for a trifling gratuity The agony of
Col Starbottle on finding his washbill made out on the unwritten side
of one of these squares and delivered to him with his weekly clean
clothes and the subsequent discovery that the remaining portions of his
letter were circulated by the same method from the Chinese laundry
of one Fung Ti of Fiddletown has been described to me as peculiarly
affecting Yet I am satisfied that a higher nature rising above the
levity induced by the mere contemplation of the insignificant details
of this breach of trust would find ample retributive justice in the
difficulties that subsequently attended Ah Fes pilgrimage

On the road to Sacramento he was twice playfully thrown from the top
of the stagecoach by an intelligent but deeplyintoxicated Caucasian
whose moral nature was shocked at riding with one addicted to
opiumsmoking At Hangtown he was beaten by a passing strangerpurely
an act of Christian supererogation At Dutch Flat he was robbed by
wellknown hands from unknown motives At Sacramento he was arrested
on suspicion of being something or other and discharged with a severe
reprimandpossibly for not being it and so delaying the course of
justice At San Francisco he was freely stoned by children of the public
schools but by carefully avoiding these monuments of enlightened
progress he at last reached in comparative safety the Chinese
quarters where his abuse was confined to the police and limited by the
strong arm of the law

The next day he entered the washhouse of Chy Fook as an assistant and
on the following Friday was sent with a basket of clean clothes to Chy
Fooks several clients

It was the usual foggy afternoon as he climbed the long windswept hill
of California Streetone of those bleak gray intervals that made the
summer a misnomer to any but the liveliest San Franciscan fancy There
was no warmth or color in earth or sky no light nor shade within or
without only one monotonous universal neutral tint over every thing
There was a fierce unrest in the windwhipped streets there was a
dreary vacant quiet in the gray houses When Ah Fe reached the top of
the hill the Mission Ridge was already hidden and the chill seabreeze
made him shiver As he put down his basket to rest himself it is
possible that to his defective intelligence and heathen experience
this Gods own climate as it was called seemed to possess but
scant tenderness softness or mercy But it is possible that Ah
Fe illogically confounded this season with his old persecutors the
schoolchildren who being released from studious confinement at this
hour were generally most aggressive So he hastened on and turning a
corner at last stopped before a small house

It was the usual San Franciscan urban cottage There was the little
strip of cold green shrubbery before it the chilly bare veranda and
above this again the grim balcony on which no one sat Ah Fe rang
the bell A servant appeared glanced at his basket and reluctantly
admitted him as if he were some necessary domestic animal Ah Fe
silently mounted the stairs and entering the open door of the
frontchamber put down the basket and stood passively on the
threshold

A woman who was sitting in the cold gray light of the window with a
child in her lap rose listlessly and came toward him Ah Fe instantly
recognized Mrs Tretherick but not a muscle of his immobile face
changed nor did his slant eyes lighten as he met her own placidly She
evidently did not recognize him as she began to count the clothes But
the child curiously examining him suddenly uttered a short glad cry

Why its John mamma Its our old John what we had in Fiddletown

For an instant Ah Fes eyes and teeth electrically lightened The child
clapped her hands and caught at his blouse Then he said shortly Me
JohnAh Feallee same Me know you How do

Mrs Tretherick dropped the clothes nervously and looked hard at Ah Fe
Wanting the quickwitted instinct of affection that sharpened Carrys
perception she even then could not distinguish him above his fellows
With a recollection of past pain and an obscure suspicion of impending
danger she asked him when he had left Fiddletown

Longee time No likee Fiddletown no likee Tlevelick Likee San Flisco
Likee washee Likee Tally

Ah Fes laconics pleased Mrs Tretherick She did not stop to consider
how much an imperfect knowledge of English added to his curt directness
and sincerity But she said Dont tell anybody you have seen me and
took out her pocketbook

Ah Fe without looking at it saw that it was nearly empty Ah Fe
without examining the apartment saw that it was scantily furnished
Ah Fe without removing his eyes from blank vacancy saw that both Mrs
Tretherick and Carry were poorly dressed Yet it is my duty to
state that Ah Fes long fingers closed promptly and firmly over the
halfdollar which Mrs Tretherick extended to him

Then he began to fumble in his blouse with a series of extraordinary
contortions After a few moments he extracted from apparently no
particular place a childs apron which he laid upon the basket with the
remark

One piecee washman flagittee

Then he began anew his fumblings and contortions At last his efforts
were rewarded by his producing apparently from his right ear a
manyfolded piece of tissuepaper Unwrapping this carefully he at
last disclosed two twentydollar goldpieces which he handed to Mrs
Tretherick

You leavee money topside of blulow Fiddletown Me findee money Me
fetchee money to you All lightee

But I left no money on the top of the bureau John said Mrs
Tretherick earnestly There must be some mistake It belongs to some
other person Take it back John

Ah Fes brow darkened He drew away from Mrs Trethericks extended
hand and began hastily to gather up his basket

Me no takee it back No no Bimeby pleesman he catchee me He say
God damn thiefcatchee flowty dollar come to jailee Me no takee
back You leavee money topside blulow Fiddletown Me fetchee money
you Me no takee back

Mrs Tretherick hesitated In the confusion of her flight she MIGHT
have left the money in the manner he had said In any event she had no
right to jeopardize this honest Chinamans safety by refusing it So she
said Very well John I will keep it But you must come again and see
mehere Mrs Tretherick hesitated with a new and sudden revelation of
the fact that any man could wish to see any other than herselfand
andCarry

Ah Fes face lightened He even uttered a short ventriloquistic laugh
without moving his mouth Then shouldering his basket he shut the door
carefully and slid quietly down stairs In the lower hall he however
found an unexpected difficulty in opening the frontdoor and after
fumbling vainly at the lock for a moment looked around for some help
or instruction But the Irish handmaid who had let him in was
contemptuously oblivious of his needs and did not appear

There occurred a mysterious and painful incident which I shall simply
record without attempting to explain On the halltable a scarf
evidently the property of the servant before alluded to was lying
As Ah Fe tried the lock with one hand the other rested lightly on the
table Suddenly and apparently of its own volition the scarf began to
creep slowly towards Ah Fes hand from Ah Fes hand it began to creep
up his sleeve slowly and with an insinuating snakelike motion
and then disappeared somewhere in the recesses of his blouse Without
betraying the least interest or concern in this phenomenon Ah Fe still
repeated his experiments upon the lock A moment later the tablecloth
of red damask moved by apparently the same mysterious impulse slowly
gathered itself under Ah Fes fingers and sinuously disappeared by the
same hidden channel What further mystery might have followed I cannot
say for at this moment Ah Fe discovered the secret of the lock and was
enabled to open the door coincident with the sound of footsteps upon
the kitchenstairs Ah Fe did not hasten his movements but patiently
shouldering his basket closed the door carefully behind him again and
stepped forth into the thick encompassing fog that now shrouded earth
and sky

From her high casementwindow Mrs Tretherick watched Ah Fes figure
until it disappeared in the gray cloud In her present loneliness she
felt a keen sense of gratitude toward him and may have ascribed to
the higher emotions and the consciousness of a good deed that certain
expansiveness of the chest and swelling of the bosom that was really
due to the hidden presence of the scarf and tablecloth under his blouse
For Mrs Tretherick was still poetically sensitive As the gray fog
deepened into night she drew Carry closer towards her and above
the prattle of the child pursued a vein of sentimental and egotistic
recollection at once bitter and dangerous The sudden apparition of Ah
Fe linked her again with her past life at Fiddletown Over the dreary
interval between she was now wanderinga journey so piteous wilful
thorny and useless that it was no wonder that at last Carry stopped
suddenly in the midst of her voluble confidences to throw her small arms
around the womans neck and bid her not to cry

Heaven forefend that I should use a pen that should be ever dedicated
to an exposition of unalterable moral principle to transcribe Mrs
Trethericks own theory of this interval and episode with its feeble
palliations its illogical deductions its fond excuses and weak
apologies It would seem however that her experience had been hard
Her slender stock of money was soon exhausted At Sacramento she
found that the composition of verse although appealing to the highest
emotions of the human heart and compelling the editorial breast to the
noblest commendation in the editorial pages was singularly inadequate
to defray the expenses of herself and Carry Then she tried the stage
but failed signally Possibly her conception of the passions was
different from that which obtained with a Sacramento audience but it
was certain that her charming presence so effective at short range was
not sufficiently pronounced for the footlights She had admirers enough
in the greenroom but awakened no abiding affection among the audience
In this strait it occurred to her that she had a voicea contralto of
no very great compass or cultivation but singularly sweet and touching
and she finally obtained position in a churchchoir She held it for
three months greatly to her pecuniary advantage and it is said much
to the satisfaction of the gentlemen in the backpews who faced toward
her during the singing of the last hymn

I remember her quite distinctly at this time The light that slanted
through the oriel of St Dives choir was wont to fall very tenderly on
her beautiful head with its stacked masses of deerskincolored hair on
the low black arches of her brows and to deepen the pretty fringes
that shaded her eyes of Genoa velvet Very pleasant it was to watch
the opening and shutting of that small straight mouth with its quick
revelation of little white teeth and to see the foolish blood faintly
deepen her satin cheek as you watched For Mrs Tretherick was very
sweetly conscious of admiration and like most pretty women gathered
herself under your eye like a racer under the spur

And then of course there came trouble I have it from the sopranoa
little lady who possessed even more than the usual unprejudiced judgment
of her sexthat Mrs Trethericks conduct was simply shameful that
her conceit was unbearable that if she considered the rest of the
choir as slaves she the soprano would like to know it that her
conduct on Easter Sunday with the basso had attracted the attention of
the whole congregation and that she herself had noticed Dr Cope
twice look up during the service that her the sopranos friends had
objected to her singing in the choir with a person who had been on the
stage but she had waived this Yet she had it from the best authority
that Mrs Tretherick had run away from her husband and that this
redhaired child who sometimes came in the choir was not her own The
tenor confided to me behind the organ that Mrs Tretherick had a way
of sustaining a note at the end of a line in order that her voice might
linger longer with the congregationan act that could be attributed
only to a defective moral nature that as a man he was a very popular
drygoods clerk on weekdays and sang a good deal from apparently
behind his eyebrows on the sabbaththat as a man sir he would put up
with it no longer The basso alonea short German with a heavy voice
for which he seemed reluctantly responsible and rather grieved at its
possessionstood up for Mrs Tretherick and averred that they were
jealous of her because she was bretty The climax was at last reached
in an open quarrel wherein Mrs Tretherick used her tongue with
such precision of statement and epithet that the soprano burst into
hysterical tears and had to be supported from the choir by her husband
and the tenor This act was marked intentionally to the congregation
by the omission of the usual soprano solo Mrs Tretherick went home
flushed with triumph but on reaching her room frantically told Carry
that they were beggars henceforward that sheher motherhad just
taken the very bread out of her darlings mouth and ended by bursting
into a flood of penitent tears They did not come so quickly as in her
old poetical days but when they came they stung deeply She was roused
by a formal visit from a vestrymanone of the music committee Mrs
Tretherick dried her long lashes put on a new neckribbon and went
down to the parlor She staid there two hoursa fact that might have
occasioned some remark but that the vestryman was married and had a
family of grownup daughters When Mrs Tretherick returned to her room
she sang to herself in the glass and scolded Carrybut she retained her
place in the choir

It was not long however In due course of time her enemies received a
powerful addition to their forces in the committeemans wife That lady
called upon several of the churchmembers and on Dr Copes family
The result was that at a later meeting of the music committee Mrs
Trethericks voice was declared inadequate to the size of the building
and she was invited to resign She did so She had been out of a
situation for two months and her scant means were almost exhausted
when Ah Fes unexpected treasure was tossed into her lap

The gray fog deepened into night and the streetlamps started into
shivering life as absorbed in these unprofitable memories Mrs
Tretherick still sat drearily at her window Even Carry had slipped away
unnoticed and her abrupt entrance with the damp evening paper in
her hand roused Mrs Tretherick and brought her back to an active
realization of the present For Mrs Tretherick was wont to scan
the advertisements in the faint hope of finding some avenue of
employmentshe knew not whatopen to her needs and Carry had noted
this habit

Mrs Tretherick mechanically closed the shutters lit the lights and
opened the paper Her eye fell instinctively on the following paragraph
in the telegraphic column


FIDDLETOWN 7thMr James Tretherick an old resident of this place
died last night of delirium tremens Mr Tretherick was addicted to
intemperate habits said to have been induced by domestic trouble


Mrs Tretherick did not start She quietly turned over another page of
the paper and glanced at Carry The child was absorbed in a book Mrs
Tretherick uttered no word but during the remainder of the evening
was unusually silent and cold When Carry was undressed and in bed Mrs
Tretherick suddenly dropped on her knees beside the bed and taking
Carrys flaming head between her hands said

Should you like to have another papa Carry darling

No said Carry after a moments thought

But a papa to help mamma take care of you to love you to give you
nice clothes to make a lady of you when you grow up

Carry turned her sleepy eyes toward the questioner Should YOU mamma

Mrs Tretherick suddenly flushed to the roots of her hair Go to
sleep she said sharply and turned away

But at midnight the child felt two white arms close tightly around her
and was drawn down into a bosom that heaved fluttered and at last was
broken up by sobs

Dont ky mamma whispered Carry with a vague retrospect of their
recent conversation Dont ky I fink I SHOULD like a new papa if he
loved you very muchvery very much

A month afterward to everybodys astonishment Mrs Tretherick was
married The happy bridegroom was one Col Starbottle recently elected
to represent Calaveras County in the legislative councils of the State
As I cannot record the event in finer language than that used by the
correspondent of The Sacramento Globe I venture to quote some of his
graceful periods The relentless shafts of the sly god have been lately
busy among our gallant Solons We quote one more unfortunate
The latest victim is the Hon C Starbottle of Calaveras The fair
enchantress in the case is a beautiful widow a former votary of
Thespis and lately a fascinating St Cecilia of one of the most
fashionable churches of San Francisco where she commanded a high
salary

The Dutch Flat Intelligencer saw fit however to comment upon the
fact with that humorous freedom characteristic of an unfettered press
The new Democratic warhorse from Calaveras has lately advented in
the legislature with a little bill to change the name of Tretherick
to Starbottle They call it a marriagecertificate down there Mr
Tretherick has been dead just one month but we presume the gallant
colonel is not afraid of ghosts It is but just to Mrs Tretherick
to state that the colonels victory was by no means an easy one To
a natural degree of coyness on the part of the lady was added the
impediment of a rivala prosperous undertaker from Sacramento who
had first seen and loved Mrs Tretherick at the theatre and church his
professional habits debarring him from ordinary social intercourse and
indeed any other than the most formal public contact with the sex As
this gentleman had made a snug fortune during the felicitous prevalence
of a severe epidemic the colonel regarded him as a dangerous rival
Fortunately however the undertaker was called in professionally to lay
out a brothersenator who had unhappily fallen by the colonels pistol
in an affair of honor and either deterred by physical consideration
from rivalry or wisely concluding that the colonel was professionally
valuable he withdrew from the field

The honeymoon was brief and brought to a close by an untoward incident
During their bridaltrip Carry had been placed in the charge of
Col Starbottles sister On their return to the city immediately on
reaching their lodgings Mrs Starbottle announced her intention of
at once proceeding to Mrs Culpeppers to bring the child home Col
Starbottle who had been exhibiting for some time a certain uneasiness
which he had endeavored to overcome by repeated stimulation finally
buttoned his coat tightly across his breast and after walking
unsteadily once or twice up and down the room suddenly faced his wife
with his most imposing manner

I have deferred said the colonel with an exaggeration of port that
increased with his inward fear and a growing thickness of speechI
have deferrI may say poshponed statement o fack thash my duty ter
dishclose ter ye I did no wish to mar sushine mushal happness to
bligh bud o promise to darken conjuglar sky by unpleasht revelashun

Gone echoed Mrs Starbottle

There was something in the tone of her voice in the sudden
drawingtogether of the pupils of her eyes that for a moment nearly
sobered the colonel and partly collapsed his chest

the colonels face

Mrs Starbottle did not move The colonel felt his chest slowly
collapsing but steadied himself against a chair and endeavored to beam
with chivalrous gallantry not unmixed with magisterial firmness upon her
as she sat

Your feelins mm do honor to yer sex but conshider situashun

you alls have me

Mrs Starbottle started to her feet YOU she cried bringing out a
chest note that made the chandeliers ringyou that I married to give
my darling food and clothesYOU a dog that I whistled to my side to
keep the men off meYOU

She choked up and then dashed past him into the inner room which had
been Carrys then she swept by him again into her own bedroom and then
suddenly reappeared before him erect menacing with a burning fire
over her cheekbones a quick straightening of her arched brows and
mouth a squaring of jaw and ophidian flattening of the head

Listen she said in a hoarse halfgrown boys voice Hear me If
you ever expect to set eyes on me again you must find the child If you
ever expect to speak to me again to touch me you must bring her back
For where she goes I go you hear me Where she has gone look for me

She struck out past him again with a quick feminine throwingout of her
arms from the elbows down as if freeing herself from some imaginary
bonds and dashing into her chamber slammed and locked the door Col
Starbottle although no coward stood in superstitious fear of an angry
woman and recoiling as she swept by lost his unsteady foothold
and rolled helplessly on the sofa Here after one or two unsuccessful
attempts to regain his foothold he remained uttering from time to time
profane but not entirely coherent or intelligible protests until at
last he succumbed to the exhausting quality of his emotions and the
narcotic quantity of his potations

Meantime within Mrs Starbottle was excitedly gathering her valuables
and packing her trunk even as she had done once before in the course
of this remarkable history Perhaps some recollection of this was in her
mind for she stopped to lean her burning cheeks upon her hand as if
she saw again the figure of the child standing in the doorway and heard
once more a childish voice asking Is it mamma But the epithet now
stung her to the quick and with a quick passionate gesture she dashed
it away with a tear that had gathered in her eye And then it chanced
that in turning over some clothes she came upon the childs slipper
with a broken sandalstring She uttered a great cry herethe first
she had utteredand caught it to her breast kissing it passionately
again and again and rocking from side to side with a motion peculiar
to her sex And then she took it to the window the better to see it
through her now streaming eyes Here she was taken with a sudden fit of
coughing that she could not stifle with the handkerchief she put to her
feverish lips And then she suddenly grew very faint The window
seemed to recede before her the floor to sink beneath her feet and
staggering to the bed she fell prone upon it with the sandal and
handkerchief pressed to her breast Her face was quite pale the orbit
of her eyes dark and there was a spot upon her lip another on her
handkerchief and still another on the white counterpane of the bed

The wind had risen rattling the windowsashes and swaying the white
curtains in a ghostly way Later a gray fog stole softly over the
roofs soothing the windroughened surfaces and inwrapping all things
in an uncertain light and a measureless peace She lay there very
quietfor all her troubles still a very pretty bride And on the
other side of the bolted door the gallant bridegroom from his temporary
couch snored peacefully


A week before Christmas Day 1870 the little town of Genoa in the
State of New York exhibited perhaps more strongly than at any
other time the bitter irony of its founders and sponsors A driving
snowstorm that had whitened every windward hedge bush wall and
telegraphpole played around this soft Italian Capitol whirled in and
out of the great staring wooden Doric columns of its postoffice
and hotel beat upon the cold green shutters of its best houses and
powdered the angular stiff dark figures in its streets From the
level of the street the four principal churches of the town stood out
starkly even while their misshapen spires were kindly hidden in the
low driving storm Near the railroadstation the new Methodist chapel
whose resemblance to an enormous locomotive was further heightened by
the addition of a pyramidal row of frontsteps like a cowcatcher stood
as if waiting for a few more houses to be hitched on to proceed to a
pleasanter location But the pride of Genoathe great Crammer Institute
for Young Ladiesstretched its bare brick length and reared its cupola
plainly from the bleak Parnassian hill above the principal avenue There
was no evasion in the Crammer Institute of the fact that it was a public
institution A visitor upon its doorsteps a pretty face at its window
were clearly visible all over the township

The shriek of the engine of the fouroclock Northern express brought
but few of the usual loungers to the depot Only a single passenger
alighted and was driven away in the solitary waiting sleigh toward the
Genoa Hotel And then the train sped away again with that
passionless indifference to human sympathies or curiosity peculiar
to expresstrains the one baggagetruck was wheeled into the station
again the stationdoor was locked and the stationmaster went home

The locomotivewhistle however awakened the guilty consciousness
of three young ladies of the Crammer Institute who were even
then surreptitiously regaling themselves in the bakeshop and
confectionerysaloon of Mistress Phillips in a bylane For even the
admirable regulations of the Institute failed to entirely develop
the physical and moral natures of its pupils They conformed to
the excellent dietary rules in public and in private drew upon the
luxurious rations of their village caterer They attended church with
exemplary formality and flirted informally during service with the
village beaux They received the best and most judicious instruction
during schoolhours and devoured the trashiest novels during recess
The result of which was an aggregation of quite healthy quite human
and very charming young creatures that reflected infinite credit on
the Institute Even Mistress Phillips to whom they owed vast sums
exhilarated by the exuberant spirits and youthful freshness of her
guests declared that the sight of them young things did her good and
had even been known to shield them by shameless equivocation

Four oclock girls and if were not back to prayers by five well
be missed said the tallest of these foolish virgins with an aquiline
nose and certain quiet elan that bespoke the leader as she rose
from her seat Have you got the books Addy Addy displayed three
dissipatedlooking novels under her waterproof And the provisions
Carry Carry showed a suspicious parcel filling the pocket of her sack
All right then Come girls trudgeCharge it she added nodding to
her host as they passed toward the door Ill pay you when my quarters
allowance comes

No Kate interposed Carry producing her purse let me pay its my
turn

Never said Kate arching her black brows loftily even if you
do have rich relatives and regular remittances from California
NeverCome girls forward march

As they opened the door a gust of wind nearly took them off their feet
Kindhearted Mrs Phillips was alarmed Sakes alive galls ye mussnt
go out in sich weather Better let me send word to the Institoot and
make ye up a nice bed tonight in my parlor But the last sentence was
lost in a chorus of halfsuppressed shrieks as the girls hand in hand
ran down the steps into the storm and were at once whirled away

The short December day unlit by any sunset glow was failing fast It
was quite dark already and the air was thick with driving snow For
some distance their high spirits youth and even inexperience kept
them bravely up but in ambitiously attempting a shortcut from the
highroad across an open field their strength gave out the laugh grew
less frequent and tears began to stand in Carrys brown eyes When they
reached the road again they were utterly exhausted Let us go back
said Carry

Wed never get across that field again said Addy

Lets stop at the first house then said Carry

The first house said Addy peering through the gathering darkness
is Squire Robinsons She darted a mischievous glance at Carry that
even in her discomfort and fear brought the quick blood to her cheek

Oh yes said Kate with gloomy irony certainly stop at the squires
by all means and be invited to tea and be driven home after tea by
your dear friend Mr Harry with a formal apology from Mrs Robinson
and hopes that the young ladies may be excused this time No continued
Kate with sudden energy That may suit YOU but Im going back as I
cameby the window or not at all Then she pounced suddenly like a
hawk on Carry who was betraying a tendency to sit down on a snowbank
and whimper and shook her briskly Youll be going to sleep next
Stay hold your tongues all of youwhats that

It was the sound of sleighbells Coming down toward them out of the
darkness was a sleigh with a single occupant Hold down your heads
girls if its anybody that knows us were lost But it was not for a
voice strange to their ears but withal very kindly and pleasant asked
if its owner could be of any help to them As they turned toward him
they saw it was a man wrapped in a handsome sealskin cloak wearing
a sealskin cap his face half concealed by a muffler of the same
material disclosing only a pair of long mustaches and two keen
dark eyes Its a son of old Santa Claus whispered Addy The girls
tittered audibly as they tumbled into the sleigh they had regained
their former spirits Where shall I take you said the stranger
quietly There was a hurried whispering and then Kate said boldly To
the Institute They drove silently up the hill until the long ascetic
building loomed up before them The stranger reined up suddenly You
know the way better than I he said Where do you go inThrough
the backwindow said Kate with sudden and appalling frankness I
see responded their strange driver quietly and alighting quickly
removed the bells from the horses We can drive as near as you please
now he added by way of explanation He certainly is a son of Santa
Claus whispered Addy Hadnt we better ask after his father Hush
said Kate decidedly He is an angel I dare say She added with a
delicious irrelevance which was however perfectly understood by her
feminine auditors We are looking like three frights

Cautiously skirting the fences they at last pulled up a few feet from
a dark wall The stranger proceeded to assist them to alight There was
still some light from the reflected snow and as he handed his fair
companions to the ground each was conscious of undergoing an intense
though respectful scrutiny He assisted them gravely to open the window
and then discreetly retired to the sleigh until the difficult and
somewhat discomposing ingress was made He then walked to the window
Thank you and goodnight whispered three voices A single figure
still lingered The stranger leaned over the windowsill Will you
permit me to light my cigar here it might attract attention if I struck
a match outside By the upspringing light he saw the figure of Kate
very charmingly framed in by the window The match burnt slowly out
in his fingers Kate smiled mischievously The astute young woman had
detected the pitiable subterfuge For what else did she stand at the
head of her class and had doting parents paid three years tuition

The storm had passed and the sun was shining quite cheerily in the
eastern recitationroom the next morning when Miss Kate whose seat
was nearest the window placing her hand pathetically upon her heart
affected to fall in bashful and extreme agitation upon the shoulder of
Carry her neighbor HE has come she gasped in a thrilling whisper
Who asked Carry sympathetically who never clearly under stood when
Kate was in earnest Whowhy the man who rescued us last night I
saw him drive to the door this moment Dont speak I shall be better in
a momentthere she said and the shameless hypocrite passed her hand
pathetically across her forehead with a tragic air

What can he want asked Carry whose curiosity was excited

I dont know said Kate suddenly relapsing into gloomy cynicism
Possibly to put his five daughters to school perhaps to finish his
young wife and warn her against us

He didnt look old and he didnt seem like a married man rejoined
Addy thoughtfully

That was his art you poor creature returned Kate scornfully You
can never tell any thing of these men they are so deceitful Besides
its just my fate

Why Kate began Carry in serious concern

Hush Miss Walker is saying something said Kate laughing

The young ladies will please give attention said a slow perfunctory
voice Miss Carry Tretherick is wanted in the parlor

Meantime Mr Jack Prince the name given on the card and various
letters and credentials submitted to the Rev Mr Crammer paced the
somewhat severe apartment known publicly as the reception parlor and
privately to the pupils as purgatory His keen eyes had taken in the
various rigid details from the flat steam radiator like an
enormous japanned sodacracker that heated one end of the room to the
monumental bust of Dr Crammer that hopelessly chilled the other
from the Lords Prayer executed by a former writingmaster in such
gratuitous variety of elegant calligraphic trifling as to considerably
abate the serious value of the composition to three views of Genoa from
the Institute which nobody ever recognized taken on the spot by the
drawingteacher from two illuminated texts of Scripture in an English
Letter so gratuitously and hideously remote as to chill all human
interest to a large photograph of the senior class in which the
prettiest girls were Ethiopian in complexion and sat apparently on
each others heads and shoulders His fingers had turned listlessly the
leaves of schoolcatalogues the Sermons of Dr Crammer the Poems
of Henry Kirke White the Lays of the Sanctuary and Lives of
Celebrated Women His fancy and it was a nervously active one had
gone over the partings and greetings that must have taken place here
and wondered why the apartment had yet caught so little of the flavor of
humanity indeed I am afraid he had almost forgotten the object of his
visit when the door opened and Carry Tretherick stood before him

It was one of those faces he had seen the night before prettier even
than it had seemed then and yet I think he was conscious of some
disappointment without knowing exactly why Her abundant waving hair
was of a guineagolden tint her complexion of a peculiar flowerlike
delicacy her brown eyes of the color of seaweed in deep water It
certainly was not her beauty that disappointed him

Without possessing his sensitiveness to impression Carry was on her
part quite as vaguely ill at ease She saw before her one of those men
whom the sex would vaguely generalize as nice that is to say
correct in all the superficial appointments of style dress manners and
feature Yet there was a decidedly unconventional quality about him he
was totally unlike any thing or anybody that she could remember and
as the attributes of originality are often as apt to alarm as to attract
people she was not entirely prepossessed in his favor

I can hardly hope he began pleasantly that you remember me It is
eleven years ago and you were a very little girl I am afraid I cannot
even claim to have enjoyed that familiarity that might exist between a
child of six and a young man of twentyone I dont think I was fond
of children But I knew your mother very well I was editor of The
Avalanche in Fiddletown when she took you to San Francisco

You mean my stepmother she wasnt my mother you know interposed
Carry hastily

Mr Prince looked at her curiously I mean your stepmother he said
gravely I never had the pleasure of meeting your mother

No MOTHER hasnt been in California these twelve years

There was an intentional emphasizing of the title and of its
distinction that began to coldly interest Prince after his first
astonishment was past

As I come from your stepmother now he went on with a slight laugh
I must ask you to go back for a few moments to that point After your
fathers death your motherI mean your stepmotherrecognized the fact
that your mother the first Mrs Tretherick was legally and morally
your guardian and although much against her inclination and
affections placed you again in her charge

My stepmother married again within a month after father died and sent
me home said Carry with great directness and the faintest toss of her
head

Mr Prince smiled so sweetly and apparently so sympathetically that
Carry began to like him With no other notice of the interruption
he went on After your stepmother had performed this act of simple
justice she entered into an agreement with your mother to defray the
expenses of your education until your eighteenth year when you were to
elect and choose which of the two should thereafter be your guardian
and with whom you would make your home This agreement I think you are
already aware of and I believe knew at the time

I was a mere child then said Carry

Certainly said Mr Prince with the same smile Still the
conditions I think have never been oppressive to you nor your mother
and the only time they are likely to give you the least uneasiness will
be when you come to make up your mind in the choice of your guardian
That will be on your eighteenth birthdaythe 20th I think of the
present month

Carry was silent

Pray do not think that I am here to receive your decision even if it
be already made I only came to inform you that your stepmother Mrs
Starbottle will be in town tomorrow and will pass a few days at the
hotel If it is your wish to see her before you make up your mind she
will be glad to meet you She does not however wish to do any thing to
influence your judgment

Does mother know she is coming said Carry hastily

I do not know said Prince gravely I only know that if you
conclude to see Mrs Starbottle it will be with your mothers
permission Mrs Starbottle will keep sacredly this part of the
agreement made ten years ago But her health is very poor and the
change and country quiet of a few days may benefit her Mr Prince bent
his keen bright eyes upon the young girl and almost held his breath
until she spoke again

Mothers coming up today or tomorrow she said looking up

Ah said Mr Prince with a sweet and languid smile

Is Col Starbottle here too asked Carry after a pause

Col Starbottle is dead Your stepmother is again a widow

Dead repeated Carry

Yes replied Mr Prince Your stepmother has been singularly
unfortunate in surviving her affections

Carry did not know what he meant and looked so Mr Prince smiled
reassuringly

Presently Carry began to whimper

Mr Prince softly stepped beside her chair

I am afraid he said with a very peculiar light in his eye and a
singular dropping of the corners of his mustacheI am afraid you are
taking this too deeply It will be some days before you are called upon
to make a decision Let us talk of something else I hope you caught no
cold last evening

Carrys face shone out again in dimples

You must have thought us so queer It was too bad to give you so much
trouble

None whatever I assure you My sense of propriety he added
demurely which might have been outraged had I been called upon to
help three young ladies out of a schoolroom window at night was deeply
gratified at being able to assist them in again The doorbell rang
loudly and Mr Prince rose Take your own time and think well before
you make your decision But Carrys ear and attention were given to
the sound of voices in the hall At the same moment the door was thrown
open and a servant announced Mrs Tretherick and Mr Robinson

The afternoon train had just shrieked out its usual indignant protest
at stopping at Genoa at all as Mr Jack Prince entered the outskirts
of the town and drove towards his hotel He was wearied and cynical
A drive of a dozen miles through unpicturesque outlying villages
past small economic farmhouses and hideous villas that violated his
fastidious taste had I fear left that gentleman in a captious state
of mind He would have even avoided his taciturn landlord as he drove up
to the door but that functionary waylaid him on the steps Theres a
lady in the sittinroom waitin for ye Mr Prince hurried up stairs
and entered the room as Mrs Starbottle flew towards him

She had changed sadly in the last ten years Her figure was wasted
to half its size The beautiful curves of her bust and shoulders were
broken or inverted The once full rounded arm was shrunken in its
sleeve and the golden hoops that encircled her wan wrists almost
slipped from her hands as her long scant fingers closed convulsively
around Jacks Her cheekbones were painted that afternoon with the
hectic of fever somewhere in the hollows of those cheeks were buried
the dimples of long ago but their graves were forgotten Her lustrous
eyes were still beautiful though the orbits were deeper than before
Her mouth was still sweet although the lips parted more easily over the
little teeth and even in breathing and showed more of them than she
was wont to do before The glory of her blonde hair was still left it
was finer more silken and ethereal yet it failed even in its plenitude
to cover the hollows of the blueveined temples

Clara said Jack reproachfully

Oh forgive me Jack she said falling into a chair but still
clinging to his hand forgive me dear but I could not wait longer
I should have died Jackdied before another night Bear with me a
little longer it will not be long but let me stay I may not see her
I know I shall not speak to her but its so sweet to feel that I am at
last near her that I breathe the same air with my darling I am better
already Jack I am indeed And you have seen her today How did
she look What did she say Tell me all every thing Jack Was she
beautiful They say she is Has she grown Would you have known her
again Will she come Jack Perhaps she has been here already perhaps
she had risen with tremulous excitement and was glancing at the
doorperhaps she is here now Why dont you speak Jack Tell me
all

The keen eyes that looked down into hers were glistening with an
infinite tenderness that none perhaps but she would have deemed them
capable of Clara he said gently and cheerily try and compose
yourself You are trembling now with the fatigue and excitement of your
journey I have seen Carry she is well and beautiful Let that suffice
you now

His gentle firmness composed and calmed her now as it had often done
before Stroking her thin hand he said after a pause Did Carry ever
write to you

Twice thanking me for some presents They were only schoolgirl
letters she added nervously answering the interrogation of his eyes

Did she ever know of your own troubles of your poverty of the
sacrifices you made to pay her bills of your pawning your clothes and
jewels of your

No no interrupted the woman quickly no How could she I have no
enemy cruel enough to tell her that

But if sheor if Mrs Tretherickhad heard of it If Carry thought
you were poor and unable to support her properly it might influence
her decision Young girls are fond of the position that wealth can give
She may have rich friends maybe a lover

Mrs Starbottle winced at the last sentence But she said eagerly
grasping Jacks hand when you found me sick and helpless at
Sacramento when youGod bless you for it Jackoffered to help me to
the East you said you knew of something you had some plan that would
make me and Carry independent

Yes said Jack hastily but I want you to get strong and well first
And now that you are calmer you shall listen to my visit to the
school

It was then that Mr Jack Prince proceeded to describe the interview
already recorded with a singular felicity and discretion that shames
my own account of that proceeding Without suppressing a single fact
without omitting a word or detail he yet managed to throw a poetic veil
over that prosaic episode to invest the heroine with a romantic roseate
atmosphere which though not perhaps entirely imaginary still I fear
exhibited that genius which ten years ago had made the columns of The
Fiddletown Avalanche at once fascinating and instructive It was not
until he saw the heightening color and heard the quick breathing of
his eager listener that he felt a pang of selfreproach God help her
and forgive me he muttered between his clinched teeth but how can I
tell her ALL now

That night when Mrs Starbottle laid her weary head upon her pillow
she tried to picture to herself Carry at the same moment sleeping
peacefully in the great schoolhouse on the hill and it was a rare
comfort to this yearning foolish woman to know that she was so near
But at this moment Carry was sitting on the edge of her bed half
undressed pouting her pretty lips and twisting her long leonine locks
between her fingers as Miss Kate Van Corleardramatically wrapped in a
long white counterpane her black eyes sparkling and her thoroughbred
nose thrown high in airstood over her like a wrathful and indignant
ghost for Carry had that evening imparted her woes and her history to
Miss Kate and that young lady had proved herself no friend by falling
into a state of fiery indignation over Carrys ingratitude and openly
and shamelessly espousing the claims of Mrs Starbottle Why if the
half you tell me is true your mother and those Robinsons are making of
you not only a little coward but a little snob miss Respectability
forsooth Look you my family are centuries before the Trethericks but
if my family had ever treated me in this way and then asked me to turn
my back on my best friend Id whistle them down the wind and here
Kate snapped her fingers bent her black brows and glared around the
room as if in search of a recreant Van Corlear

You just talk this way because you have taken a fancy to that Mr
Prince said Carry

In the debasing slang of the period that had even found its way
into the virgin cloisters of the Crammer Institute Miss Kate as she
afterwards expressed it instantly went for her

First with a shake of her head she threw her long black hair over one
shoulder then dropping one end of the counterpane from the other like
a vestal tunic she stepped before Carry with a purposelyexaggerated
classic stride And what if I have miss What if I happen to know
a gentleman when I see him What if I happen to know that among a
thousand such traditional conventional feeble editions of their
grandfathers as Mr Harry Robinson you cannot find one original
independent individualized gentleman like your Prince Go to bed miss
and pray to Heaven that he may be YOUR Prince indeed Ask to have a
contrite and grateful heart and thank the Lord in particular for having
sent you such a friend as Kate Van Corlear Yet after an imposing
dramatic exit she reappeared the next moment as a straight white
flash kissed Carry between the brows and was gone

The next day was a weary one to Jack Prince He was convinced in his
mind that Carry would not come yet to keep this consciousness from
Mrs Starbottle to meet her simple hopefulness with an equal degree of
apparent faith was a hard and difficult task He would have tried to
divert her mind by taking her on a long drive but she was fearful that
Carry might come during her absence and her strength he was obliged to
admit had failed greatly As he looked into her large and aweinspiring
clear eyes a something he tried to keep from his mindto put off day
by day from contemplationkept asserting itself directly to his inner
consciousness He began to doubt the expediency and wisdom of his
management He recalled every incident of his interview with Carry and
half believed that its failure was due to himself Yet Mrs Starbottle
was very patient and confident her very confidence shook his faith in
his own judgment When her strength was equal to the exertion she was
propped up in her chair by the window where she could see the school
and the entrance to the hotel In the intervals she would elaborate
pleasant plans for the future and would sketch a country home She had
taken a strange fancy as it seemed to Prince to the present location
but it was notable that the future always thus outlined was one of
quiet and repose She believed she would get well soon in fact she
thought she was now much better than she had been but it might be long
before she should be quite strong again She would whisper on in this
way until Jack would dash madly down into the barroom order liquors
that he did not drink light cigars that he did not smoke talk with men
that he did not listen to and behave generally as our stronger sex is
apt to do in periods of delicate trials and perplexity

The day closed with a clouded sky and a bitter searching wind With
the night fell a few wandering flakes of snow She was still content
and hopeful and as Jack wheeled her from the window to the fire she
explained to him how that as the schoolterm was drawing near its
close Carry was probably kept closely at her lessons during the day
and could only leave the school at night So she sat up the greater part
of the evening and combed her silken hair and as far as her strength
would allow made an undress toilet to receive her guest We must not
frighten the child Jack she said apologetically and with something
of her old coquetry

It was with a feeling of relief that at ten oclock Jack received a
message from the landlord saying that the doctor would like to see
him for a moment down stairs As Jack entered the grim dimlylighted
parlor he observed the hooded figure of a woman near the fire He was
about to withdraw again when a voice that he remembered very pleasantly
said

Oh its all right Im the doctor

The hood was thrown back and Prince saw the shining black hair and
black audacious eyes of Kate Van Corlear

Dont ask any questions Im the doctor and theres my prescription
and she pointed to the halffrightened halfsobbing Carry in the
cornerto be taken at once

Then Mrs Tretherick has given her permission

Not much if I know the sentiments of that lady replied Kate saucily

Then how did you get away asked Prince gravely

BY THE WINDOW

When Mr Prince had left Carry in the arms of her stepmother he
returned to the parlor

Well demanded Kate

She will stayYOU will I hope alsotonight

As I shall not be eighteen and my own mistress on the 20th and as I
havent a sick stepmother I wont

Then you will give me the pleasure of seeing you safely through the
window again

When Mr Prince returned an hour later he found Carry sitting on a low
stool at Mrs Starbottles feet Her head was in her stepmothers lap
and she had sobbed herself to sleep Mrs Starbottle put her finger
to her lip I told you she would come God bless you Jack and
goodnight

The next morning Mrs Tretherick indignant the Rev Asa Crammer
principal injured and Mr Joel Robinson sen complacently
respectable called upon Mr Prince There was a stormy meeting ending
in a demand for Carry We certainly cannot admit of this interference
said Mrs Tretherick a fashionably dressed indistinctive looking
woman It is several days before the expiration of our agreement and
we do not feel under the circumstances justified in releasing
Mrs Starbottle from its conditions Until the expiration of the
schoolterm we must consider Miss Tretherick as complying entirely with
its rules and discipline imposed Dr Crammer The whole proceeding is
calculated to injure the prospects and compromise the position of Miss
Tretherick in society suggested Mr Robinson

In vain Mr Prince urged the failing condition of Mrs Starbottle her
absolute freedom from complicity with Carrys flight the pardonable
and natural instincts of the girl and his own assurance that they were
willing to abide by her decision And then with a rising color in his
cheek a dangerous look in his eye but a singular calmness in his
speech he added

One word more It becomes my duty to inform you of a circumstance which
would certainly justify me as an executor of the late Mr Tretherick
in fully resisting your demands A few months after Mr Trethericks
death through the agency of a Chinaman in his employment it was
discovered that he had made a will which was subsequently found among
his papers The insignificant value of his bequestmostly land then
quite valuelessprevented his executors from carrying out his wishes
or from even proving the will or making it otherwise publicly known
until within the last two or three years when the property had
enormously increased in value The provisions of that bequest are
simple but unmistakable The property is divided between Carry and
her stepmother with the explicit condition that Mrs Starbottle shall
become her legal guardian provide for her education and in all details
stand to her in loco parentis

What is the value of this bequest asked Mr Robinson I cannot
tell exactly but not far from half a million I should say returned
Prince Certainly with this knowledge as a friend of Miss Tretherick
I must say that her conduct is as judicious as it is honorable to her
responded Mr Robinson I shall not presume to question the wishes
or throw any obstacles in the way of carrying out the intentions of my
dead husband added Mrs Tretherick and the interview was closed

When its result was made known to Mrs Starbottle she raised Jacks
hand to her feverish lips It cannot add to MY happiness now Jack but
tell me why did you keep it from her Jack smiled but did not reply

Within the next week the necessary legal formalities were concluded and
Carry was restored to her stepmother At Mrs Starbottles request a
small house in the outskirts of the town was procured and thither they
removed to wait the spring and Mrs Starbottles convalescence Both
came tardily that year

Yet she was happy and patient She was fond of watching the budding
of the trees beyond her windowa novel sight to her Californian
experienceand of asking Carry their names and seasons Even at this
time she projected for that summer which seemed to her so mysteriously
withheld long walks with Carry through the leafy woods whose gray
misty ranks she could see along the hilltop She even thought she
could write poetry about them and recalled the fact as evidence of her
gaining strength and there is I believe still treasured by one of the
members of this little household a little carol so joyous so simple
and so innocent that it might have been an echo of the robin that
called to her from the window as perhaps it was

And then without warning there dropped from Heaven a day so tender so
mystically soft so dreamily beautiful so throbbing and alive with the
fluttering of invisible wings so replete and bounteously overflowing
with an awakening and joyous resurrection not taught by man or limited
by creed that they thought it fit to bring her out and lay her in that
glorious sunshine that sprinkled like the droppings of a bridal torch
the happy lintels and doors And there she lay beatified and calm

Wearied by watching Carry had fallen asleep by her side and Mrs
Starbottles thin fingers lay like a benediction on her head Presently
she called Jack to her side

Who was that she whispered who just came in

Miss Van Corlear said Jack answering the look in her great hollow
eyes

Jack she said after a moments silence sit by me a moment dear
Jack Ive something I must say If I ever seemed hard or cold or
coquettish to you in the old days it was because I loved you Jack too
well to mar your future by linking it with my own I always loved you
dear Jack even when I seemed least worthy of you That is gone now
But I had a dream lately Jack a foolish womans dreamthat you might
find what I lacked in HER and she glanced lovingly at the sleeping
girl at her side that you might love her as you have loved me But
even that is not to be Jack is it and she glanced wistfully in his
face Jack pressed her hand but did not speak After a few moments
silence she again said Perhaps you are right in your choice She is a
goodhearted girl Jackbut a little bold

And with this last flicker of foolish weak humanity in her struggling
spirit she spoke no more When they came to her a moment later a tiny
bird that had lit upon her breast flew away and the hand that they
lifted from Carrys head fell lifeless at her side




A JERSEY CENTENARIAN


I have seen her at last She is a hundred and seven years old and
remembers George Washington quite distinctly It is somewhat confusing
however that she also remembers a contemporaneous Josiah W Perkins of
Basking Ridge N J and I think has the impression that Perkins was
the better man Perkins at the close of the last century paid her some
little attention There are a few things that a really noble woman of a
hundred and seven never forgets

It was Perkins who said to her in 1795 in the streets of Philadelphia
Shall I show thee Gen Washington Then she said carelesslike for
you know child at that time it wasnt what it is now to see Gen
Washington she said So do Josiah so do Then he pointed to a
tall man who got out of a carriage and went into a large house He was
larger than you be He wore his own hairnot powdered had a
flowered chintz vest with yellow breeches and blue stockings and a
broadbrimmed hat In summer he wore a white straw hat and at his farm
at Basking Ridge he always wore it At this point it became too evident
that she was describing the clothes of the allfascinating Perkins so I
gently but firmly led her back to Washington Then it appeared that she
did not remember exactly what he wore To assist her I sketched the
general historic dress of that period She said she thought he was
dressed like that Emboldened by my success I added a hat of Charles
II and pointed shoes of the eleventh century She indorsed these with
such cheerful alacrity that I dropped the subject

The house upon which I had stumbled or rather to which my horsea
Jersey hack accustomed to historic researchhad brought me was
low and quaint Like most old houses it had the appearance of being
encroached upon by the surrounding glebe as if it were already half in
the grave with a sod or two in the shape of moss thrown on it like
ashes on ashes and dust on dust A wooden house instead of acquiring
dignity with age is apt to lose its youth and respectability together
A porch with scant sloping seats from which even the winters snow
must have slid uncomfortably projected from a doorway that opened most
unjustifiably into a small sittingroom There was no vestibule or
locus poenitentiae for the embarrassed or bashful visitor he passed
at once from the security of the public road into shameful privacy
And here in the mellow autumnal sunlight that streaming through the
maples and sumach on the opposite bank flickered and danced upon the
floor she sat and discoursed of George Washington and thought of
Perkins She was quite in keeping with the house and the season albeit
a little in advance of both her skin being of a faded russet and her
hands so like dead November leaves that I fancied they even rustled
when she moved them

For all that she was quite bright and cheery her faculties still quite
vigorous although performing irregularly and spasmodically It was
somewhat discomposing I confess to observe that at times her lower
jaw would drop leaving her speechless until one of the family would
notice it and raise it smartly into place with a slight snapan
operation always performed in such an habitual perfunctory manner
generally in passing to and fro in their household duties that it was
very trying to the spectator It was still more embarrassing to observe
that the dear old lady had evidently no knowledge of this but believed
she was still talking and that on resuming her actual vocal utterance
she was often abrupt and incoherent beginning always in the middle of
a sentence and often in the middle of a word Sometimes said her
daughter a giddy thoughtless young thing of eightyfivesometimes
just moving her head sort of unhitches her jaw and if we dont happen
to see it shell go on talking for hours without ever making a sound
Although I was convinced after this that during my interview I had
lost several important revelations regarding George Washington through
these peculiar lapses I could not help reflecting how beneficent were
these provisions of the Creatorhow if properly studied and applied
they might be fraught with happiness to mankindhow a slight jostle
or jar at a dinnerparty might make the postprandial eloquence of
garrulous senility satisfactory to itself yet harmless to othershow
a more intimate knowledge of anatomy introduced into the domestic
circle might make a home tolerable at least if not happyhow a
longsuffering husband under the pretence of a conjugal caress
might so unhook his wifes condyloid process as to allow the flow of
expostulation criticism or denunciation to go on with gratification
to her and perfect immunity to himself

But this was not getting back to George Washington and the early
struggles of the Republic So I returned to the commanderinchief but
found after one or two leading questions that she was rather inclined
to resent his reappearance on the stage Her reminiscences here were
chiefly social and local and more or less flavored with Perkins We got
back as far as the Revolutionary epoch or rather her impressions of
that epoch when it was still fresh in the public mind And here I came
upon an incident purely personal and local but withal so novel
weird and uncanny that for a while I fear it quite displaced George
Washington in my mind and tinged the autumnal fields beyond with a red
that was not of the sumach I do not remember to have read of it in the
books I do not know that it is entirely authentic It was attested to
me by mother and daughter as an uncontradicted tradition

In the little field beyond where the plough still turns up musketballs
and cartridgeboxes took place one of those irregular skirmishes
between the militiamen and Knyphausens stragglers that made the
retreat historical A Hessian soldier wounded in both legs and utterly
helpless dragged himself to the cover of a hazelcopse and lay there
hidden for two days On the third day maddened by thirst he managed
to creep to the railfence of an adjoining farmhouse but found himself
unable to mount it or pass through There was no one in the house but
a little girl of six or seven years He called to her and in a faint
voice asked for water She returned to the house as if to comply
with his request but mounting a chair took from the chimney
a heavilyloaded Queen Anne musket and going to the door took
deliberate aim at the helpless intruder and fired The man fell back
dead without a groan She replaced the musket and returning to the
fence covered the body with boughs and leaves until it was hidden Two
or three days after she related the occurrence in a careless casual
way and leading the way to the fence with a piece of bread and butter
in her guileless little fingers pointed out the result of her simple
unsophisticated effort The Hessian was decently buried but I could not
find out what became of the little girl Nobody seemed to remember I
trust that in afteryears she was happily married that no Jersey
Lovelace attempted to trifle with a heart whose impulses were so prompt
and whose purposes were so sincere They did not seem to know if she had
married or not Yet it does not seem probable that such simplicity of
conception frankness of expression and deftness of execution were
lost to posterity or that they failed in their time and season to
give flavor to the domestic felicity of the period Beyond this
the story perhaps has little value except as an offset to the usual
anecdotes of Hessian atrocity

They had their financial panics even in Jersey in the old days
She remembered when Dr White married your cousin Maryor was it
Susanyes it was Susan She remembers that your Uncle Harry brought
in an armful of banknotespaper money you knowand threw them in
the corner saying they were no good to anybody She remembered playing
with them and giving them to your Aunt Annano child it was your own
mother bless your heart Some of them was marked as high as a hundred
dollars Everybody kept gold and silver in a stocking or in a chaney
vase like that You never used money to buy any thing When Josiah went
to Springfield to buy any thing he took a cartload of things with him
to exchange That yaller pictureframe was paid for in greenings But
then people knew jest what they had They didnt fritter their substance
away in unchristian trifles like your father Eliza Jane who doesnt
know that there is a God who will smite him hip and thigh for vengeance
is mine and those that believe in me But here singularly enough the
inferior maxillaries gave out and her jaw dropped I noticed that her
giddy daughter of eightyfive was sitting near her but I do not pretend
to connect this fact with the arrested flow of personal disclosure
Howbeit when she recovered her speech again it appeared that she was
complaining of the weather

The seasons had changed very much since your father went to sea
The winters used to be terrible in those days When she went over to
Springfield in June she saw the snow still on Watsons Ridge There
were whole days when you couldnt git over to William Henrys their
next neighbor a quarter of a mile away It was that drefful winter that
the Spanish sailor was found You dont remember the Spanish sailor
Eliza Janeit was before your time There was a little personal
skirmishing here which I feared at first might end in a suspension of
maxillary functions and the loss of the story but here it is Ah me
it is a pure white winter idyl how shall I sing it this bright gay
autumnal day

It was a terrible night that winters night when she and the century
were young together The sun was lost at three oclock the snowy night
came down like a white sheet that flapped around the house beat at the
windows with its edges and at last wrapped it in a close embrace In
the middle of the night they thought they heard above the wind a voice
crying Christus Christus in a foreign tongue They opened the
doorno easy task in the north wind that pressed its strong shoulders
against itbut nothing was to be seen but the drifting snow The next
morning dawned on fences hidden and a landscape changed and obliterated
with drift During the day they again heard the cry of Christus this
time faint and hidden like a childs voice They searched in vain the
drifted snow hid its secret On the third day they broke a path to the
fence and then they heard the cry distinctly Digging down they found
the body of a mana Spanish sailor dark and bearded with earrings
in his ears As they stood gazing down at his cold and pulseless figure
the cry of Christus again rose upon the wintry air and they turned
and fled in superstitious terror to the house And then one of the
children bolder than the rest knelt down and opened the dead mans
rough peajacket and foundwhat think youa little blueandgreen
parrot nestling against his breast It was the bird that had echoed
mechanically the last despairing cry of the life that was given to save
it It was the bird that ever after amid outlandish oaths and wilder
sailorsongs that I fear often shocked the pure ears of its gentle
mistress and brought scandal into the Jerseys still retained that one
weird and mournful cry

The sun meanwhile was sinking behind the steadfast range beyond and I
could not help feeling that I must depart with my wants unsatisfied
I had brought away no historic fragment I absolutely knew little or
nothing new regarding George Washington I had been addressed variously
by the names of different members of the family who were dead and
forgotten I had stood for an hour in the past yet I had not added to
my historical knowledge nor the practical benefit of your readers I
spoke once more of Washington and she replied with a reminiscence of
Perkins

Stand forth O Josiah W Perkins of Basking Ridge N J Thou wast of
little account in thy life I warrant thou didst not even feel the
greatness of thy day and time thou didst criticise thy superiors thou
wast small and narrow in thy ways thy very name and grave are unknown
and uncared for but thou wast once kind to a woman who survived thee
and lo thy name is again spoken of men and for a moment lifted up
above thy betters
