CHAPTER I

A LAMB FOR THE SACRIFICE


Perez observed Captain Eri cheerfully Im tryin to average up with
the mistakes of Providence

The Captain was seated by the open door of the dining room in the
rocker with the patched cane seat He was apparently very busy doing
something with a piece of fishline and a pair of longlegged rubber
boots Captain Perez swinging back and forth in the parlor rocker with
the patchwork cushion was puffing deliberately at a wooden pipe the
bowl of which was carved into the likeness of a very rakish damsel with
a sailors cap set upon the side of her once flaxen head In response
to his companions remark he lazily turned his sunburned face toward the
caneseated rocker and inquired

What on airth are you doin with them boots

Captain Eri tied a knot with his fingers and teeth and then held the
boots out at arms length

Why Perez he said Im averagin up same as I told you Providence
made me a twolegged critter and a twolegged critter needs two boots
Ive always been able to find one of these boots right off whenever I
wanted it but its took me so plaguey long to find the other one that
whatever wet there was dried up afore I got out of the house Yesterday
when I wanted to go clammin I found the left one on the mantelpiece no
trouble at all but it was pretty nigh high water before I dug the other
one out of the washbiler Thats why Im splicin em together this
way I dont want to promise nothin rash but Im in hopes that even
Jerry cant lose em now

Humph grunted Captain Perez I dont think much of that plan Stead
of losin one youll lose both of em

Yes but then I shant care If there aint NO boots in sight Ill
go barefoot or stay at home Its the kind of responsibleness that goes
with havin one boot thats wearin me out Where IS Jerry

He went out to feed Lorenzo I heard him callin a minute ago That cat
aint been home sence noon and Jerrys worried

A stentorian shout of Puss puss Come kitty kitty kitty came from
somewhere outside Captain Eri smiled

Im fraid Lorenzos gittin dissipated in his old age he observed
Then as a fat gray cat shot past the door There he is Reglar
prodigal son Comes home when the fatted cafs ready

A moment later Captain Jerry appeared milk pitcher in hand He entered
the dining room and putting the pitcher down on the table pulled
forward the armchair with the painted sunset on the back produced his
own pipe and proceeded to hunt through one pocket after the other with
a troubled expression of countenance

Where in tunket is my terbacker he asked after finishing the round
of pockets and preparing to begin all over again

I see it on the top of the clock a spell ago said Captain Perez

Was that yours Jerry exclaimed Captain Eri Well thats too bad I
see it there and thought twas mine Here tis or whats left of it

Captain Jerry took the remnant of a plug from his friend and said in an
aggrieved tone

Thats jest like you Eri Never have a place for nothin and help
yourself to anything you happen to want dont make no odds whose tis
Why dont you take care of your terbacker sames I do of mine

Now see here Jerry I aint so sure that is yours Let me see it
Humph I thought so This is Navy Plug and you always smoke Sailors
Sweetheart Talk about havin a place for things

Thats MY terbacker if you want to know observed Captain Perez
Ive got yours Eri Here tis

Well then where IS mine said Captain Jerry somewhat snappishly

Bet a dollar youve got it in your pocket said Captain Eri

Bet ten dollars I aint I aint quite a fool yit Eri Hedge I guess
I knowwell I snum I forgot that upper vest pocket and from the
pocket mentioned Captain Jerry produced the missing tobacco

There was a general laugh in which Captain Jerry was obliged to join
and the trio smoked in silence for a time while the expanse of water
to the eastward darkened and the outer beach became but a dusky streak
separating the ocean from the inner bay At length Captain Perez rose
and knocking the ashes from his pipe announced that he was going to
show a glim

Yes go ahead Jerry said Captain Eri its gittin dark

Its darker in the grave observed Captain Perez with lugubrious
philosophy

Then for the lands sake lets have it light while we can Here Jerry
them matches is burnt ones Try this twont be so damagin to the
morals

Captain Jerry took the proffered match and lit the two bracket lamps
fastened to the walls of the dining room The room seen by the
lamplight was shiplike but as decidedly not shipshape The chronometer
on the mantel was obscured by a thick layer of dust The three gorgeous
oil paintingsfrom the brush of the local sign painterrespectively
representing the coasting packet Hannah M Eri Hedge Master and the
fishing schooners Georgie Baker Jeremiah Burgess Master and the
Flying Duck Perez Ryder Master were shrouded in a very realistic fog
of the same dust Even the imposing giltlettered set of Lives of Great
Naval Commanders purchased by Captain Perez some months before and
being slowly paid for on an apparently neverending installment plan
was cloaked with it The heap of newspapers shoved under the couch to
get them out of the way peeped forth in a telltale manner The windows
were not too clean and the floor needed sweeping Incidentally the
supper table had not been cleared Each one of the three noted these
things and each sighed Then Captain Eri said as if to change the
subject though no one had spoken

What started you talkin about the grave Perez Was it them clam
fritters of Jerrys

No answered the exskipper of the Flying Duck pulling at his
grizzled scrap of throat whisker and looking rather shamefaced You
see Mlissy Busteed dropped in a few minutes this mornin while you
fellers was out and

Both Captain Eri and Captain Jerry set up a hilarious shout

Haw haw roared the former slapping his knee I wouldnt be so
fascinatin as you be for no money Perez Shell have you yit you
cant git away But say I dont wonder you got to thinkin bout the
grave Ten minutes of Mlissy gits me thinkin of things way tother
side of that

Aw belay there Eri protested Captain Perez testily Twant my
fault I didnt see her comin or Id have got out of sight She was
cruisin round the way she always does with a cargo of gabble and she
put in here to unload Talk I never heard a woman talk the way she can
Shed be a good one to have on board in a calm Git her talkin abaft
the mainsl and wed have a twentyknot breeze in a shake

What was it this time asked Captain Jerry

Oh a little of everything She begun about the beautiful sermon that
Mr Perley preached at the last ComeOuters meetin That was what
started me thinkin about the grave I guess Then she pitched into
Seth Wingates wife for havin a new bunnit this season when the old one
want haf wore out She talked for ten minutes or so on that and then
she begun about Parkers bein let go over at the cable station and
about the new feller thats been signed to take his place Shes all for
Parker Says he was a perfectly lovely man and that twas outrageous
the way he was treated and all that sort of thing

She aint the only one that thinks so observed Captain Jerry
Theres a heap of folks in this town that think Parker was a mighty
fine feller

Yes said Captain Eri and its worth while noticin who they be
Perez friend Mlissy thinks so and Squealer Wixon and his gang
think so and Web Saunders thinks so and a lot more like them Parker
was TOO good a feller thats what was the matter with him His talk
always reminded me of washday at the poorhouse lots of soft soap with
plenty of lye in it

Well Mlissy says that the men over to the stationall except
Langley of courseare mad as all gitout because Parker was let
go and she says somebody told somebody else and somebody else told
somebody else and somebody else told HERshe says it come reel
straightthat the men are goin to make it hot for the new feller when
he comes She says his names Hazeltine or somethin like that and
that hes goin to get here tomorrer or next day

Well said Captain Eri its a mercy Mlissy found it out If that
man should git here and she not know it aforehand twould kill her sure
as fate and think what a blow that would be to you Perez

He took his oldfashioned watch from his pocket and glanced at the dial

I mustnt be settin round here much longer he added John Baxters
goin to have that little patch of cranberry swamp of his picked
tomorrer and hes expectin some barrels down on tonights train
John asked me to git Zoeth Cahoon to cart em down for him but I aint
got nothin special to do tonight so I thought Id hitch up and go
and git em myself You and Jerry can match cents to see who does the
dishes I did em last night so its my watch below

Well _I_ shant do em declared Captain Perez Blessed if Id do
the durn things tonight if the President of the United States asked me
to

Humph sputtered Captain Jerry I spose you fellers think Ill do
em all the time If you do youre mistook thats all Twant last
night you done em Eri twas the night afore I done em last night
and Im ready to take my chances agin if we match but Im jiggered if
I let you shove the whole thing off onto me I didnt ship for cook no
more n the rest of you

Neither of the others saw fit to answer this declaration of independence
and there was a pause in the conversation Then Captain Jerry said
moodily

It aint no use It dont work

What dont work asked Captain Eri

Why this plan of ours I thought when we fellers give up goin to
sea reglar and settled down here to keep house ourselves and live
economical and all that that twas goin to be fine I thought I
wouldnt mind doin my share of the work a bit thought twould be kind
of fun to swab decks and all that Well twas for a spell but taint
now Im so sick of it that I dont know what to do And Im sick of
livin in a pigpen too Look at them deadlights Theyre so dirty that
when I turn out in the mornin and go to look through em I cant tell
whether its foul weather or fair

Captain Eri looked at the windows toward which his friend pointed and
signed assent

Theres no use talkin he observed weve got to have a steward
aboard this craft

Yes said Captain Perez emphatically a steward or a woman

A WOMAN exclaimed Captain Eri Then he shook his head solemnly and
added There Jerry What did I tell you Mlissy

But Captain Perez did not smile

I aint foolin he said I mean it

Captain Jerry thought of the spickandspan days of his wife dead these
twenty years and sighed again I spose we might have a housekeeper
he said

Housekeeper sneered Captain Eri Whod you hire Perez dont
seeminly take to Mlissy and there aint nobody else in Orham that
you could git less twas old Ant Zuby Higgins and that would be
actin like the feller that jumped overboard when his boat sprung a
leak No sir If Ant Zuby ships aboard here I heave up MY commission

Who said anything about Ant Zuby or housekeepers either inquired
Captain Perez I said wed got to have a woman and we have One of us
ll have to git married thats all

MARRIED roared the two in chorus

Thats what I said married and take the others to board in this
house Look here now When a shipwrecked crews starvin one of em has
to be sacrificed for the good of the rest and thats what weve got to
do One of us has got to git married for the benefit of the other two

Captain Eri shouted hilariously Good boy Perez he cried Goin to
be the first offerin

Not unless its my luck Eri Well all three match for it same as we
do bout washin the dishes

Where are you goin to find a wife asked Captain Jerry

Now thats jest what Im goin to show you I see how things was goin
and Ive been thinkin this over for a considrable spell Hold on a
minute till I overhaul my kit

He went into the front bedroom and through the open door they could see
him turning over the contents of the chest with P R in brass nails
on the lid He scattered about him fishlines hooks lead for sinkers
oilcloth jackets whales teeth and various other articles and at
length came back bearing a muchcrumpled sheet of printed paper This he
spread out upon the dining table first pushing aside the dishes to make
room and after adjusting his spectacles said triumphantly

There There she is The Nuptial Chime A Journal of Matrimony I
see a piece about it in the Herald the other day and sent a dime for
a sample copy Its chockfull of advertisements from women that wants
husbands

Captain Eri put on his spectacles and hitched his chair up to the table
After giving the pages of the Nuptial Chime a hurried inspection he
remarked

There seems to be a strong runnin to vivacious brunettes and
blondes with tender and romantic dispositions Which of them kinds are
you sufferin for Perez Oh say heres a lady thats willin to
heave herself away on a young and handsome bachelor with a income of ten
thousand a year Seems to me you ought to answer that

Oh hush up Eri Taint likely Id want to write to any of them in
there The thing for us to do would be to write out a advertisement of
our own tell what sort of woman we want and then set back and wait for
answers Now what do you say

Captain Eri looked at the advocate of matrimony for a moment without
speaking Then he said Do you really mean it Perez

Sartin I do

What do you think of it Jerry

Think its a good idee said that ancient mariner decisively Weve
got to do somethin and this looks like the only sensible thing

Then Eris GOT to do it asserted Captain Perez dogmatically We
agreed to stick together and two to ones a vote Come on now Eri
well match

Captain Eri hesitated

Come on Eri ordered Captain Jerry Aint goin to mutiny are you

All right said Captain Eri Ill stick to the ship Only he added
with a quizzical glance at his companions its got to be settled
that the feller thats stuck can pick his wife and dont have to marry
unless he finds one that suits him

The others agreed to this stipulation and Captain Perez drawing a long
breath took a coin from his pocket flipped it in the air and covered
it as it fell on the table with a big hairy hand Captain Eri did
likewise so did Captain Jerry Then Captain Eri lifted his hand and
showed the coin beneath it was a head Captain Jerrys was a tail
Under Captain Perez hand lurked the hidden fate The Captains lips
closed in a grim line With a desperate glance at the others he jerked
his hand away

The penny lay head uppermost Captain Jerry was stuck

Captain Eri rose glanced at his watch and taking his hat from the
shelf where the dishes should have been opened the door Before he went
out however he turned and said

Perez you and Jerry can be fixin up the advertisement while Im gone
You can let me see it when I come back I say Jerry he added to the
sacrifice who sat gazing at the pennies on the table in a sort of
trance dont feel bad about it Why when you come to think of it
its a providence it turned out that way Me and Perez are bachelors
and wed be jest green hands But youre a able seaman you know what it
is to manage a wife

Yes I do groaned Captain Jerry lugubriously Durn it thats jest
it

Captain Eri was chuckling as lantern in hand he passed around the
corner of the little white house on the way to the barn He chuckled
all through the harnessing of Daniel the venerable white horse He was
still chuckling as perched on the seat of the truck wagon he rattled
and shook out of the yard and turned into the sandy road that led up to
the village And an outsider hearing these chuckles and knowing what
had gone before might have inferred that perhaps Captain Eri did not
view the matching and the matrimonial project with quite the deadly
seriousness of the other two occupants of the house by the shore



CHAPTER II

THE TRAIN COMES IN


There is in Orham a selfappointed committee whose duty it is to see the
train come in The committeemen receive no salary for their services
the sole compensation is the pleasure derived from the sense of duty
done Rain snow or shine the committee is on hand at the stationthe
natives of course call it the deepoto consume borrowed tobacco
and to favor Providence with its advice concerning the running of the
universe Also it discusses local affairs with fluency and more or less
point

Mr Squealer Wixon a lifelong member of this committee was the first
to sight Captain Eri as the latter strolled across the tracks into the
circle of light from the station lamps The Captain had moored Daniel to
a picket in the fence over by the freighthouse He had heard the clock
in the belfry of the Methodist church strike eight as he drove by that
edifice but he heard no whistle from the direction of the West Orham
woods so he knew that the down train would arrive at its usual time
that is from fifteen to twenty minutes behind the schedule

Hey shouted Mr Wixon with enthusiasm Heres Capn Eri Well Cap
hows she headin

Bout notheast by noth was the calm reply Runnin fair but with
lookout for wind ahead

Haint got a spare chaw nowheres about you have you Capn anxiously
inquired Bluey Batcheldor Mr Batcheldor is called Bluey for the
same reason that Mr Wixon is called Squealer and that reason has
been forgotten for years

Captain Eri obligingly produced a black plug of smoking tobacco and Mr
Batcheldor bit off twothirds and returned the balance After adjusting
the morsel so that it might interfere in the least degree with his vocal
machinery he drawled

I callate you aint heard the news Eri Web Saunders has got his
originalpackage license It come on the noon mail

The Captain turned sharply toward the speaker Is that a fact he
asked Who told you

See it myself So did Squealer and a whole lot more Web was showin it
round

We was wonderin said Jabez Smalley a member of the committee whose
standing was somewhat impaired inasmuch as he went fishing occasionally
and was therefore obliged to miss some of the meetings what kind of
a fit John Baxter would have now Hes been pretty nigh distracted ever
sence Web started his billiard room callin it a hant of sin and a
whole lot more names There aint been a ComeOuters meetin sence
I dont know when that he aint pitched into that saloon Now when he
hears that Webs goin to sell rum hell bust a biler sure

The committee received this prophecy with an hilarious shout of approval
and each member began to talk Captain Eri took advantage of this
simultaneous expression of opinion to walk away He looked in at the
window of the ticketoffice exchanged greetings with Sam Hardy the
stationmaster and then leaned against the corner of the building
furthest removed from Mr Wixon and his friends lit his pipe and puffed
thoughtfully with a troubled expression on his face

From the clump of blackness that indicated the beginning of the West
Orham woods came a longdrawn dismal toot then two shorter ones The
committee sprang to its feet and looked interested Sam Hardy came out
of the ticket office The stagedriver a sharplooking boy of about
fourteen with a disagreeable air of cheap smartness sticking out all
over him left his seat in the shadow of Mr Batcheldors manly form
tossed a cigarette stump away and loafed over to the vicinity of the
depot wagon which was backed up against the platform Captain Eri
knocked the ashes from his pipe and put that servicestained veteran in
his pocket The train was really coming in at last

If this had been an August evening instead of a September one both
train and platform would have been crowded But the butterfly summer
maiden had flitted and as is his wont the summer man had flitted after
her so the passengers who alighted from the two coaches that with
the freight car made up the Orham Branch train were few in number and
homely in flavor There was a very stout lady with a canvas extension
case and an umbrella in one hand and a bulging shawlstrap and a
pasteboard box in the other who panted and wheezed like the locomotive
itself and who asked the brakeman What on airth DO they have such high
steps for There was a slim not to say gawky individual with a chin
beard and rubber boots whom the committee hailed as Andy and welcomed
to its bosom There were two young men drummers evidently who nodded
to Hardy and seemed very much at home Also there was another young
man smoothshaven and squareshouldered who deposited a suitcase on
the platform and looked about him with the air of being very far from
home indeed

The drummers and the stout lady got into the stage The young man with
the suitcase picked up the latter and walked toward the same vehicle
He accosted the sharp boy who had lighted another cigarette

Can you direct me to the cable station he asked

Sure thing said the youth and there was no Cape Cod twist to his
accent Git aboard

I didnt intend to ride said the stranger

What was you goin to do Walk

Yes if its not far

The boy grinned and the members of the committee who had been staring
with all their might grinned also The young mans mention of the cable
station seemed to have caused considerable excitement

Oh it aint too FAR said the stagedriver Then he added Say
youre the new electrician aint you

The young man hesitated for a moment Then he said Yes and
suggested I asked the way

Two blocks to the right thats the main road keep on that for four
blocks then turn to the left and if you keep on straight ahead youll
get to the station

Blocks The stranger smiled I think you must be from New York

Do you inquired the youthful prodigy climbing to the wagon seat
Dont forget to keep straight ahead after you turn off the main road
Git dap So long fellers He leaned over the wheel as the stage
turned and bestowed a wink upon the delighted Squealer who was
holding one freckled paw over his mouth then the depot wagon creaked
away

The squareshouldered young man looked after the equipage with an odd
expression of countenance Then he shrugged his shoulders picked up the
suitcase and walked off the platform into the darkness

Mr Wixon removed the hand from his mouth and displayed a mammoth
grin that grew into a shriek of laughter in which every member of the
committee joined

Haw haw bellowed Bluey so thats the feller that done Parker out
of his job Well he may be mighty smart but if that Joe Bartlett aint
smarter then Im a skate thats all Smartest boy ever I see If you
keep on straight ahead youll git to the station Gosh hell have to
wear rubbers

Maybe hes webfooted suggested Smalley and they laughed again

A little later Captain Eri with a dozen new cleansmelling cranberry
barrels in the wagon behind him drove slowly down the depot road It
was a clear night but there was no moon and Orham was almost at its
darkest which is very dark indeed The depot roadplease bear in
mind that there are no streets in Orhamwas full of ruts and although
Daniel knew his way and did his best to follow it the cranberry barrels
rattled and shook in lively fashion There are few homes near the
station and the dwellers in them conscientiously refrain from showing
lights except in the ends of the buildings furthest from the front
Strangers are inclined to wonder at this but when they become better
acquainted with the town and its people they come to know that front
gates and parlors are by the majority of the inhabitants restricted in
their use to occasions such as a funeral or possibly a wedding For
the average Orham family to sit in the parlor on a week evening would be
an act bordering pretty closely on sacrilege

It is from the hill by the Methodist church that the visitor to Orham
gets his best view of the village It is all about him and for the most
part below him At night the lights in the houses show only here and
there through the trees but those on the beaches and at sea shine
out plainly The brilliant yellow gleam a mile away is from the Orham
lighthouse on the bluff The smaller white dot marks the light on
Bakers Beach The tiny red speck in the distance that goes and comes
again is the flashlight at Setuckit Point and the twinkle on the
horizon to the south is the beacon of the lightship on Sand Hill Shoal

It is on his arrival at this point too that the stranger first notices
the sound of the surf Being a newcomer he notices this at once after
he has been in the village a few weeks he ceases to notice it at all
It is like the ticking of a clock so incessant and regular that one
has to listen intently for a moment or two before his accustomed ear
will single it out and make it definite One low steady continuous
roar a little deeper in tone when the wind is easterly the voice of
the old dog Ocean gnawing with foaming mouth at the bone of the Cape and
growling as he gnaws

It may be that the young man with the square shoulders and the suitcase
had paused at the turn of the road by the church to listen to this
song of the sea at any rate he was there and when Captain Eri steered
Daniel and the cranberry barrels around the corner and into the main
road he stepped out and hailed

I beg your pardon he said Im afraid Im mixed in my directions
The stagedriver told me the way to the cable station but Ive
forgotten whether he said to turn to the right when I reached here or
to the left

Captain Eri took his lantern from the floor of the wagon and held it up
He had seen the stranger when the latter left the train but he had not
heard the dialogue with Josiah Bartlett

How was you callatin to go to the station he asked

Why I intended to walk

Did you tell them fellers at the depot that you wanted to walk

Certainly

Well I swan And they give you the direction

Yes a little impatiently why shouldnt they So many blocks till I
got to the main street or road and so many more till I got somewhere
else and then straight on

Blocks hey Thats Joe Bartlett That boy ought to be mastheaded and
Ive told Perez so moren once Well Mister I guess maybe youd better
not try to walk to the cable station tonight You see theres one
thing they forgot to tell you The stations on the outer beach and
theres a haf mile of pretty wet water between here and there

The young man whistled You dont mean it he exclaimed

I sartin do unless theres been an almighty drought since I left the
house I tell you what If youll jump in here with me and dont mind
waitin till I leave these barrels at the house of the man that owns
em Ill drive you down to the shore and maybe find somebody to row you
over That is with a chuckle if you aint dead set on walkin

The stranger laughed heartily Im not so stubborn as all that he
said Its mighty good of you all the same

Dont say a word said the Captain Give us your satchel Now your
flipper There you are Git dap Danl

Daniel accepted the Captains command in a tolerant spirit He paddled
along at a jogtrot for perhaps a hundred yards and then evidently
feeling that he had done all that could be expected settled back into a
walk The Captain turned towards his companion on the seat

I dont know as I mentioned it he observed but my name is Hedge

Glad to meet you Mr Hedge said the stranger My name is
Hazeltine

I kind of jedged it might be when you said you wanted to git to the
cable station We heard you was expected

Did you From Mr Langley I presume

Noo not drectly Of course we knew Parker had been let go and that
somebody would have to take his place I guess likely it was one of the
operators that told it fust that you was the man but anyhow it got as
fur as Mlissy Busteed and after that twas plain sailin You come
from New York dont you

Yes

Well you know how tis when a thing gits into the papers Orham aint
big enough to have a paper of its own so the Almighty give us Mlissy
I jedge as a sort of substitute She can spread a little news over more
country than anybody I know If she spreads butter the same way she
could make money keepin boarders Is this your fust visit to the Cape

Yes I hardly know why Im here now I have been with the Cable Company
at their New York experimental station for some years and the other day
the General Manager called me into his office and told me I was expected
to take the position of electrician here I thought it might add to my
experience so I accepted

Humph Did he say anything about the general liveliness of things
around the station

Mr Hazeltine laughed Why he answered now that you speak of it
I remember that he began by asking me if I had any marked objection to
premature burial

The Captain chuckled The outer beach in winter aint exactly a
campmeeting for sociableness he said And the idea of that Bartlett
boy tellin you how to walk there

Is he a specimen of your Cape Cod youngsters

Not exactly Hes a new shipment from New York Grandnephew of a
messmate of mine Capn Perez Ryder Perez hes a bachelor but his
sisters daughter married a feller named Bartlett Maybe you knew him
he used to run a tugboat in the Sound

Mr Hazeltine much amused denied the acquaintance

Well I spose you wouldnt natrally continued the Captain
Anyhow Perezs nieces husband died and the boy sort of run loose
as yer might say Went to school when he had to and raised Ned when
he didnt nears I can find out Lizabeth thats his ma died last
spring and she made Perez promisehe being the only relation the
youngster hadto fetch the boy down here and sort of bring him up
Perez knows as much about bringing up a boy as a hen does about the Ten
Commandments and Lizabeth made him promise not to lick the youngster
and a whole lot more foolishness School dont commence here till
October so we got him a job with Lem Mullett at the livry stable Hes
boardin with Lem till school opens He aint a reel bad boy but he
knows too much bout some things and not haf enough bout others
Youve seen fellers like that maybe

Hazeltine nodded There are a good many of that kind in New York Im
afraid he said

Captain Eri smiled I shouldnt wonder he observed The boys down
here think Josiahs the whole crew and the girls aint fur behind
Theres been more deviltry in this village sence he landed than there
ever was afore He needs somethin and needs it bad but I aint
decided jest what it is yit Are you a married man

No

Same here Never had the disease Perez hes had symptoms every once
in a while but nothin lastin Jerrys the only one of us three thats
been through the mill His wife died twenty year ago I dont know as
I told you but Jerry and Perez and me are keepin house down by the
shore That is we call it keepin house but

Here the Captain broke off and seemed to meditate

Ralph Hazeltine forbore to interrupt and occupied himself by
scrutinizing the buildings that they were passing They were nearing the
center of the town now and the houses were closer together than they
had been on the depot road but never so close as to be in the least
crowded Each house had its ample front yard and the new arrival
could smell the box hedges and see now and then the whiteness of the
kalsomined stones that bordered a driveway It was too dark for the big
seashells at the front steps to be visible but they were there all the
same every third house of respectability in Orham has them There was
an occasional shop too with signs like Cape Cod Variety Store or
The Boston Dry Goods Emporium over their doors On the platform of
one a small crowd was gathered and from the interior came shouts of
laughter and the sound of a tinpanny piano

Thats the billiard saloon volunteered Captain Eri suddenly waking
from his trance Play pool Mr Hazeltine

Sometimes

What dye play it with

Why with a cue generally speaking

That so Most of the fellers in there play it with their mouths Miss a
shot and then spend the rest of the evenin tellin how it happened

I dont think I should care to play it that way said Ralph laughing

Well it has its good pints Kind of allround exercise develops the
lungs and strengthens the muscles as the patentmedicine almanac says
Parker played it considerable

I judge that your opinion of my predecessor isnt a high one

Who Oh Parker He was all right in his way Good many folks in this
town swore by him I understand the fellers over at the station thought
he was about the ticket

Mr Langley included

Oh Mr Langley bein manager had his own ideas I spose Langley
dont play pool much not at Web Saunders place anyhow We turn in
here

They rolled up a long driveway very dark and overgrown with trees and
drew up at the back door of a goodsized twostory house There was a
light in the kitchen window

Whoa Danl commanded the Captain Then he began to shout Ship
ahoy at the top of his lungs

The kitchen door opened and a man came out carrying a lamp its light
shining full upon his face It was an old face a stern face with white
eyebrows and a thinlipped mouth Just such a face as looked on with
approval when the executioner held up the head of Charles I at
Whitehall There was however a tremble about the chin that told of
infirm health

Hello John said Captain Eri heartily John let me make you
acquainted with Mr Hazeltine the new man at the cable station Mr
Hazeltine this is my friend Capn John Baxter

The two shook hands and then Captain Eri said

John I brought down them barrels for you Hawkins got em here same
as he always does by the skin of his teeth Stand by now cause Ive
got to deliver Mr Hazeltine at the station and its gittin late

John Baxter said nothing beyond thanking his friend for the good turn
but he stood by as directed and the barrels were quickly unloaded
As they were about to drive out of the yard Captain Eri turned in his
seat and said

John guess Ill be up some time tomorrow I want to talk with you
about that billiardroom business

The lamp in Baxters hand shook

God Amightys got his eye on that place Eri Hedge he shouted and
on them thats runnin it

Thats all right said the Captain Then the jobs in good hands and
we aint got to worry Goodnight

But in spite of this assurance Hazeltine noticed that his driver was
silent and preoccupied until they reached the end of the road by the
shore when he brought the willing Daniel to a stand still and announced
that it was time to change cars

It is a fifteenminute row from the mainland to the outer beach and
Captain Eri made it on schedule time Hazeltine protested that he was
used to a boat and could go alone and return the dory in the morning
but the Captain wouldnt hear of it The dory slid up on the sand and
the passenger climbed out The sound of the surf on the ocean side of
the beach was no longer a steady roar it was broken into splashing
plunges and hisses with running through it a series of blows like
those of a muffled hammer The wind was wet and smelt salty

Theres the station said the Captain pointing to a row of lighted
windows a quarter of a mile away It IS straight ahead this time and
the walkins bettern it has been for the last few minutes Goodnight

The electrician put his hand in his pocket hesitated and then withdrew
it empty

Im very much obliged to you for all this he said Im glad to have
made your acquaintance and I hope we shall see each other often

Same here said the Captain heartily Were likely to git together
once in a while seein as were nextdoor neighbors right across the
road as you might say Thats my berth over yonder where you see them
lights Its jest round the corner from the road we drove down last
Goodnight Good luck to you

And he settled himself for the row home



CHAPTER III

THE COMEOUTERS MEETING


The house where the three Captains lived was as near salt water as it
could be and remain out of reach of the highest tides When Captain Eri
after beaching and anchoring his dory and stabling Daniel for the night
entered the dining room he found his two messmates deep in consultation
and with evidences of strenuous mental struggle written upon their
faces Captain Perezs right hand was smeared with ink and there were
several spatters of the same fluid on Captain Jerrys perspiring nose
Crumpled sheets of note paper were on the table and floor and Lorenzo
who was purring restfully upon the discarded jackets of the two
mariners alone seemed to be enjoying himself

Well you fellers look as if youd had a rough vyage commented
Captain Eri slipping out of his own jacket and pulling his chair up
beside those of his friends Whats the trouble

Gosh Eri Im glad to see you exclaimed Captain Perez drawing the
hand just referred to across his forehead and thereby putting
that portion of his countenance into mourning How do you spell
conscientious

I dont unless its owners orders was the answer What do you want
to spell it for

Weve writ much as four hundred advertisements I do believe said
Captain Jerry and there aint one of them fit to feed to a pig Perez
here hes got such hifalutin notions that nothin less than a circus
bill ll do him _I_ dont see why somethin plain and sensible like
Woman wanted to do dishes and clean house for three men wouldnt be
all right but no its got to have more fancy trimmins than a Sunday
bunnit Foolishness I call it

Youd have a whole lot of women answerin that advertisement now
wouldnt you snorted Captain Perez hotly To do dishes for three
men Thats a healthy bait to catch a wife with aint it I can see
em comin I callate youd stay single till Jedgment and then you
wouldnt git one No sir The thing to do is to be sort of softsoapy
and hightoned Let em think theyre goin to git a bargain when
they git you Make believe its goin to be a privilege to git sech a
husband

Well tis declared the sacrifice indignantly They might git a
dumsight worse one

I callate thats so Jerry said Captain Eri Still Perez aint
altogether wrong Guess youd better keep the dishwashin out of it
I know dishwashin would never git ME Ive got so I hate the sight of
soap and hot water as bad as if I was a Portugee Pass me that pen

Captain Perez gladly relinquished the writing materials and Captain
Eri after two or three trials by which he added to the paper
decorations of the floor produced the following

Wife WantedBy an exseafaring man of steady habbits Must be willing
to Work and Keep House shipshape and aboveboard No sealawyers need
apply AddressSkipper care the Nuptial Chime Boston Mass

The line relating to sealawyers was insisted upon by Captain Jerry
Thatll shut out the tonguey kind he explained The advertisement
with this addition being duly approved the required fifty cents was
inclosed as was a letter to the editor of the matrimonial journal
requesting all answers to be forwarded to Captain Jeremiah Burgess
Orham Mass Then the envelope was directed and the stamp affixed

There said Captain Eri thats done All youve got to do now
Jerry is to pick out your wife and let us know what you want for a
weddin present Youre a lucky man

Aw lets talk about somethin else said the lucky one rather
gloomily Whats the news up at the depot Eri

They received the tidings of the coming of Hazeltine with the interest
due to such an event Captain Eri gave them a detailed account of his
meeting with the new electrician omitting however in consideration
for the feelings of Captain Perez to mention the fact that it was
the Bartlett boy who started that gentleman upon his walk to the cable
station

Well what did you think of him asked Captain Perez when the recital
was finished

Seemed to me like a pretty good feller answered Captain Eri
deliberately He didnt git mad at the joke the gang played on him for
one thing He aint so smoothtongued as Parker used to be and he didnt
treat Baxter and me as if Cape Codders was a kind of animals the way
some of the summer folks do He had the sense not to offer to pay me for
takin him over to the station and I liked that Take it altogether
he seemed like a pretty decent chapfor a New Yorker he added as an
after thought

But say he said a moment later Ive got some more news and it aint
good news either Web Saunders has got his liquor license

I want to know exclaimed Captain Perez

You dont tell me said Captain Jerry

Then they both said What will John Baxter do now And Captain Eri
shook his head dubiously

The cod bit well next morning and Captain Eri did not get in from the
Windward Ledge until afternoon By the way it may be well to explain
that Captain Jerrys remarks concerning settlin down and restin
which we chronicled in the first chapter must not be accepted too
literally While it is true that each of the trio had given up long
voyages it is equally true that none had given up work entirely Some
people might not consider it restful to rise at four every weekday
morning and sail in a catboat twelve miles out to sea and haul a wet
cod line for hours not to mention the sail home and the cleaning and
barreling of the catch Captain Eri did that Captain Perez was what
he called stevedorethat is general caretaker during the owners
absence at Mr Delancy Barrys summer estate on the cliff road As
for Captain Jerry he was janitor at the schoolhouse

The catch was heavy the next morning as has been said and by the time
the last fish was split and iced and the last barrel sent to the railway
station it was almost supper time Captain Eri had intended calling
on Baxter early in the day but now he determined to wait until after
supper

The Captain had bad luck in the matching that followed the meal and
it was nearly eight oclock before he finished washing dishes This
distasteful task being completed he set out for the Baxter homestead

The Captains views on the liquor question were broader than those of
many Orham citizens He was an abstainer generally speaking but his
scruples were not as pronounced as those of Miss Abigail Mullett
whose proudest boast was that she had refused brandy when the doctor
prescribed it as the stimulant needed to save her life Over and over
again has Miss Abigail told it in prayermeeting how she riz up in
her bed expectin every breath to be the last and said Dr Palmer
if its got to be liquor or death then death referred tomeaning
it is fair to presume that death was preferred rather than the brandy
With much more concerning her miraculous recovery through the aid of a
terbacker and onion poultice

On general principles the Captain objected to the granting of a license
to a fellow like Web Saunders but it was the effect that this action
of the State authorities might have upon his friend John Baxter that
troubled him most

For fortyfive years John Baxter was called by Cape Cod people as smart
a skipper as ever trod a plank He saved money built an attractive
home for his wife and daughter and would in the ordinary course of
events have retired to enjoy a comfortable old age But his wife died
shortly after the daughters marriage to a Boston man and on a voyage
to Manila Baxter himself suffered from a sunstroke and a subsequent
fever that left him a physical wreck and for a time threatened to
unsettle his reason He recovered a portion of his health and the
threatened insanity disappeared except for a religious fanaticism
that caused him to accept the Bible literally and to interpret it
accordingly When his daughter and her husband were drowned in the
terrible City of Belfast disaster it is an Orham tradition that John
Baxter dressed in gunnybags and sitting on an ashheap was found by
his friends mourning in what he believed to be the Biblical sackcloth
and ashes His little baby granddaughter had been looked out for by
some kind friends in Boston Only Captain Eri knew that John Baxters
yearly trip to Boston was made for the purpose of visiting the girl who
was his sole reminder of the things that might have been but even the
Captain did not know that the money that paid her board and as she grew
older for her gowns and schooling came from the bigoted stern old
hermit living alone in the old house at Orham

In Orham and in other sections of the Cape as well there is a sect
called by the ungodly The ComeOuters They were originally seceders
from the Methodist churches who disapproved of modern innovations They
come out once a week to meet at the houses of the members and theirs
are lively meetings John Baxter was a ComeOuter and ever since
the enterprising Mr Saunders opened his billiard room the old mans
tirades of righteous wrath had been directed against this den of
iniquity Since it became known that Web had made application for the
license it was a regular amusement for the unregenerate to attend the
gatherings of the ComeOuters and hear John Baxter call down fire from
Heaven upon the billiard room its proprietor and its patrons Orham
people had begun to say that John Baxter was billiardsaloon crazy

And John Baxter was Captain Eris friend a friendship that had begun in
school when the declaimer of Patrick Henrys Liberty or Death speech
on Examination Day took a fancy to and refused to laugh at the little
chap who tremblingly ventured to assert that he loved little Pussy her
coat is so warm The two had changed places until now it was Captain
Eri who protected and advised

When the Captain rapped at John Baxters kitchen door no one answered
and after yelling Ship ahoy through the keyhole a number of times
he was forced to the conclusion that his friend was not at home

You lookin fer Capn Baxter queried Mrs Sarah Taylor who lived
just across the road Hes gone to ComeOuters meetin I guess
Theres one up to Barzilla Smalls tonight

Mr Barzilla Small lived in that part of the village called down to the
neck and when the Captain arrived there he found the parlor filled
with the devout who were somewhat surprised to see him

Why how do you do said Mrs Small resplendent in black alpaca and
wearing her jet earrings I snum if you aint a stranger Well have a
reel movin meetin tonight because Mr Perleys here and he says
he feels the sperrit aworkin Set right down there by the whatnot
Luther to her oldest but three give Capn Hedge your chair You can
set on the cricket Yes you can Dont answer back

Aw ma burst out the indignant Luther how dyer think Im goin to
set on that cricket My laigs ll be way up under my chin Make Hart set
on it hes shortern me

Shant nuther Lute Small declared Hartwell a frecklefaced
youngster who was the next step downward in the family stair of
children Set on it yourself Make him ma now You said hed have
to

Now ma I

Be still both of you I shd think youd be ashamed with everybody
here so Oh my soul and body turning to the company if it aint
enough to try a saint Sometimes seemss if I SHOULD give up You be
thankful Abigail to Miss Mullett who sat by the door that you
aint got nine in a family and nobody to help teach em manners If
Barzilla was like most men hed have some disCIPline in the house
but no I have to do it all and

Mr Small thus publicly rebuked rose from his seat in the corner by
the melodeon and proclaimed in a voice that he tried hard not to make
apologetic

Now Luther if I was you Id be a good boy and mind ma

Even this aweinspiring command had little effect upon the reluctant
Luther but Captain Eri who smiling and bowing right and left had
been working his passage to the other side of the room announced
that he was all right and would squeeze in on the sofy side of Capn
Baxter So there was peace once more that is as much peace as half a
dozen feminine tongues all busy with different subjects would allow

Why Eri whispered John Baxter I didnt expect to see you here Im
glad though Lord knows every Godfearin man in this town has need to
be on his knees this night Have you heard about it

Capn John means about the rumsellin license that Web Saunders has
got volunteered Miss Melissa Busteed leaning over from her seat in
the patent rocker that had been the premium earned by Mrs Small for
selling one hundred and fifty pounds of tea for a muchadvertised house
Aint it awful I says to Prissy Baker this mornin soon s I heard of
it Prissy s I there ll be a jedgment on this town sures youre
a livin woman s I Says she Thats so Mlissy s she and I
says

Well when Miss Busteed talks interruptions are futile so Captain Eri
sat silent as the comments of at least onetenth of the population of
Orham were poured into his ears The recitation was cut short by Mrs
Smalls vigorous pounding on the center table

Were blessed this evenin said the hostess with emotion in havin
Mr Perley with us Hes goin to lead the meetin

The Reverend Mr PerleyReverend by courtesy he had never been
ordainedstood up cleared his throat with vigor rose an inch or two
on the toes of a very squeaky pair of boots sank to heel level again
and announced that everyone would join in singing Hymn number one
hundred and ten omitting the second and fourth stanzas hymn number
one hundred and ten second and fourth stanzas omitted The melodeon
tormented by Mrs Lurania Bassett shrieked and groaned and the hymn
was sung So was another and yet another Then Mr Perley squeaked to
his tiptoes again subsided and began a lengthy and fervent discourse

Mr Perley had been a blacksmith in Ostable before he got religion
and now spent the major portion of his time in boardin round with
ComeOuters up and down the Cape and taking part in their meetings
His services at such gatherings paid for his food and lodging He had
been a vigorous horseshoer in the old days now he preached just as
vigorously

He spoke of the faithful few here gathered together He spoke of the
scoffing of those outside the pale and hinted at the uncomfortable
future that awaited them He ran over the various denominations one by
one and one by one showed them to be worshipers of idols and followers
after strange gods He sank hoarsely into the bass and quavered up into
falsetto and a chorus of Amens and Hallelujahs followed him

Oh brothers and sisters he shouted here we are akneelin at
the altars foot and whats goin on outside Why the Devils got
his clutches in our midst The horn of the wicked is exalted Theyre
sellin rumRUMin this town Theyre asellin rum and drinkin of it
and gloryin in their shame But the Lord aint asleep Hes got his eye
on em Hes watchin em And some of these fine days hell send down
fire out of Heaven and wipe em off the face of the earth Amen
Glory Glory Glory

John Baxter was on his feet his lean face working the perspiration
shining on his forehead his eyes gleaming like lamps under his rough
white eyebrows and his clenched fists pounding the back of the chair in
front of him His hallelujahs were the last to cease Captain Eri had to
use some little force to pull him down on the sofa again

Then Mrs Small struck up Oh brother have you heard and they sang
it with enthusiasm Next Miss Mullett told her story of the brandy
and the defiance of the doctor Nobody seemed much interested except a
nervous young man with sandy hair and a celluloid collar who had come
with Mr Tobias Wixon and was evidently a stranger He had not heard it
before and seemed somewhat puzzled when Miss Abigail repeated the Death
referred to passage

There was more singing Mrs Small testified So did Barzilla with
many hesitations and false starts and an air of relief when it was
over Then another hymn and more testimony each speaker denouncing the
billiard saloon Then John Baxter arose and spoke

He began by saying that the people of Orham had been slothful in the
Lords vineyard They had allowed weeds to spring up and wax strong
They had been tried and found wanting

I tell you brothers and sisters he declaimed leaning over the chair
back and shaking a thin forefinger in Mr Perleys face God has given
us a task to do and how have we done it Weve set still and let the
Devil have his way Weve talked and talked but what have we done
Nothin Nothin at all and now the grip of Satan is tighter on the
town than it ever has been afore The Lord set us a watch to keep and
weve slept on watch And now theres a trap set for every young man in
this cmunity Do you think that that hellhole down yonder is goin to
shut up because we talk about it in meetin Do you think Web Saunders
is goin to quit sellin rum because we say he ought to Do you think
Gods goin to walk up to that door and nail it up himself No sir He
dont work that way Weve talked and talked and now its time to DO
Aint there anybody here that feels a call Aint there axes to chop
with and fire to burn I tell you brothers weve waited long enough
Iold as I amam ready Lord here I am Here I am

He swayed broke into a fit of coughing and sank back upon the sofa
trembling all over and still muttering that he was ready There was a
hushed silence for a moment or two and then a storm of hallelujahs and
shouts Mr Perley started another hymn and it was sung with tremendous
enthusiasm

Just behind the nervous young man with the celluloid collar sat a stout
individual with a bald head This was Abijah Thompson known by the
irreverent as Barking Thompson a nickname bestowed because of his
peculiar habit of gradually puffing up like a frog under religious
excitement and then bursting forth in an inarticulate shout
disconcerting to the uninitiated During Baxters speech and the singing
of the hymn his expansive red cheeks had been distended like balloons
and his breath came shorter and shorter Mr Perley had arisen and was
holding up his hand for silence when with one terrific Boo Barking
Thompsons spiritual exaltation exploded directly in the ear of the
nervous stranger

The young man shot out of his chair as if Mr Thompson had fired a
dynamite charge beneath him Oh the Devil he shrieked and then
subsided blushing to the back of his neck

Somehow this interruption took the spirit out of the meeting Giggles
from Luther and the younger element interfered with the solemnity of Mr
Perleys closing remarks and no one else was brave enough to testify
under the circumstances They sang again and the meeting broke up The
nervous young man was the first one to leave

Captain Eri got his friend out of the clutches of the ComeOuters as
quickly as possible and piloted him down the road toward his home John
Baxter was silent and absentminded and most of the Captains cheerful
remarks concerning Orham affairs in general went unanswered As they
turned in at the gate the elder man said

Eri do you believe that mans law ought to be allowed to interfere
with Gods law

Well John in most cases its my jedgment that it pays to steer pretty
close to both of em

Spose God called you to break mans law and keep His what would you
do

Guess the fust thing would be to make sure twas the Almighty that was
callin I dont want to say nothin to hurt your feelins but I
should advise the feller that thought that he had that kind of a call to
beware of imitations as the soap folks advertise

Eri Ive got a call

Now John Baxter you listen You and me have been sailin together as
you might say for forty odd years I aint a religious man cordin to
your way of thinkin but Ive generally found that the Lord runs things
most as well as us folks could run em When theres a leak at one end
of the schooner it dont pay to bore a hole at the other end to let the
water out Dont you worry no more about Web Saunders and that billiard
saloon The slectmen ll attend to them afore very long Why dont you
go up to Boston for a couple of weeks Twill do you good

Do you think so Eri Well maybe twouldmaybe twould Sometimes I
feel as if my head was kind of wearin out Ill think about it

Better not think any more better go right ahead

Well Ill see Goodnight

Goodnight John


Perez said Captain Eri next day seems to me some kinds of religion
is like whisky mighty bad for a weak head I wish somebody d invent a
gold cure for ComeOuters



CHAPTER IV

A PICTURE SENT AND A CABLE TESTED


Something over a fortnight went by and the three captains had received
no answers from the advertisement in the Nuptial Chime The suspense
affected each of them in a different manner Captain Jerry was nervous
and apprehensive He said nothing and asked no questions but it was
noticeable that he was the first to greet the carrier of the mail box
when that individual came down the road and as the days passed and
nothing more important than the Cape Cod Item and a patentmedicine
circular came to hand a look that a suspicious person might have deemed
expressive of hope began to appear in his face

Captain Perez on the contrary grew more and more disgusted with the
delay He spent a good deal of time wondering why there were no replies
and he even went so far as to suggest writing to the editor of
the Chime He was disposed to lay the blame upon Captain Eris
advertisement and hinted that the latter was not catchy enough

Captain Eri alone of the trio got any amusement out of the situation
He pretended to see in Captain Jerry an impatient bridegroom and
administered comfort in large doses by suggesting that in all
probability there had been so many replies that it had been found
necessary to charter a freightcar to bring them down

Cheer up Jerry he said Its tough on you I know but think of all
them poor sufferin females thats settin up nights and worryin for
fear they wont be picked out Why say when you make your chice
youll have to let the rest know right off twould be cruelty to
animals not to You ought to put em out of their misery quicks
possible

Captain Jerrys laugh was almost dismal

The first batch of answers from the Chime came by an evening mail
Captain Eri happened to beat the postoffice that night and brought them
home himself They filled three of his pockets to overflowing and
he dumped them by handfuls on the dining table under the nose of the
pallid Jerry

What did I tell you Jerry he crowed I knew they was on the way
What have you got to say about my advertisement now Perez

There were twentysix letters altogether It was surprising how
many women were willing even anxious to ally themselves with an
exseafaring man of steady habbits But most of the applicants were of
unsatisfactory types As Captain Perez expressed it Theres too many
of them everlastin blondes and things

There was one note however that even Captain Eri was disposed to
consider seriously It was postmarked Nantucket was written on half a
sheet of bluelined paper and read as follows


MR SKIPPER

Sir I saw your advertisements in the paper and think perhaps you might
suit me Please answer these questions by return mail What is your
religious belief Do you drink liquor Are you a profane man If you
want to you might send me your real name and a photograph If I think
you will suit maybe we might sign articles

Yours truly

MARTHA B SNOW

NANTUCKET MASS


What I like about that is the shipshape way she puts it commented
Captain Perez She dont say that she jest adores the ocean

Shes mighty handy about takin hold and bossin things there aint
no doubt of that said Captain Eri Notice its us thats got to suit
her not her us I kind of like that signin articles too You bet
shes been brought up in a seagoin family

I used to know a Jubal Snow that hailed from Nantucket suggested
Perez maybe shes some of his folks

Taint likely sniffed Captain Jerry Theres more Snows in Nantucket
than you can shake a stick at You cant heave a rock without hittin
one

I blieve shes jest the kind we want said Captain Perez with
conviction

What do you say Jerry asked Captain Eri Youre goin to be the
lucky man you know

Oh I dont know Whats the use of hurryin More n likely the next
lot of letters ll have somethin better yit

Now thats jest like you Jerry Burgess exclaimed Perez disgustedly
Want to put off and put off and put off And the house gittin more
like the focastle on a cattleboat every day

I dont blieve myself youd do much better Jerry said Captain Eri
seriously I like that letter somehow Seems to me its worth a try

Oh all right Have it your own way Of course _I_ aint got nothin
to say Im only the divilish fool thats got to git married and keep
boarders thats all _I_ am

Be careful She asked if you was a profane man

Aw shut up You fellers are enough to make a minister swear _I_ dont
care what you do Go ahead and write to her if you want to only I give
you fair warnin I aint goin to have her if she dont suit I aint
goin to marry no scarecrow

Between them and with much diplomacy they soothed the indignant
candidate for matrimony until he agreed to sign his name to a letter to
the Nantucket lady Then Captain Perez said

But I say Jerry she wants your picture Have you got one to send
her

Ive got that daguerreotype I had took when I was married afore

He rummaged it out of his chest and displayed it rather proudly It
showed him as a short sandyhaired youth whose sunburned face beamed
from the depths of an enormous choker and whose head was crowned with a
tall flatbrimmed silk hat of a forgotten style

I spose that might do said Capn Perez hesitatingly

Do Twill HAVE to do seein its all hes got said Captain Eri
Good land he chuckled look at that hat Say Jerry shell think
you done your seafarin in Noahs ark

But Captain Jerry was oblivious to sarcasm just then He was gazing at
the daguerreotype in a sentimental sort of way blowing the dust from
the glass and tilting it up and down so as to bring it to the most
effective light

I swan he mused I dont know when Ive looked at that afore I
remember when I bought that hat jest as well Took care of it and
brushed itmy my I dont know but its somewheres around now I
thought I was jest about the ticket then andand I want BAD lookin
thats a fact

This last with a burst of enthusiasm

Ho ho Perez roared Captain Eri Jerrys fallin in love with his
own picture Awful thing for one so young aint it

I aint such a turrible sight older n you be Eri Hedge sputtered
the prospective bridegroom with righteous indignation Then he added in
a rather crestfallen tone But I am a heap older n I was when I had
that daguerreotype took See here if I send that Nantucket woman this
picture wont she notice the difference when she sees me

What if she does broke in Captain Perez You can tell her how twas
Talk her over A feller thats been married like you ought to be able
to talk ANY woman over

Captain Jerry didnt appear sanguine concerning his ability to talk her
over but his fellowconspirators made light of his feeble objections
and the daguerreotype carefully wrapped was mailed the next morning
accompanied by a brief biographical sketch of the original and his
avowed adherence to the Baptist creed and the Good Templars abstinence

I hope shell hurry up and answer said the impatient Captain Perez
I want to get this thing settled one way or another Dont you Jerry

Yes was the hesitating reply One way or another

Captain Eri had seen John Baxter several times since the evening of
the ComeOuters meeting The old man was calmer apparently and was
disposed to take the billiardsaloon matter less seriously particularly
as it was reported that the town selectmen were to hold a special
meeting to consider the question of allowing Mr Saunders to continue in
business The lastnamed gentleman had given what he was pleased to call
a blowout to his regular patrons in celebration of the granting of
the license and Squealer Wixon and one or two more spent a dreary day
and night in the town lockup in consequence Baxter told the Captain
that he had not yet made up his mind concerning the proposed Boston
trip but he thought more n likely he should go

Captain Eri was obliged to be content with this assurance but he
determined to keep a close watch on his friend just the same

He had met Ralph Hazeltine once or twice since the latters arrival in
Orham and in response to questions as to how he was getting on at the
station the new electrician invariably responded Firstrate Gossip
however in the person of Miss Busteed reported that the operators were
doing their best to keep Mr Hazeltines lot from being altogether a bed
of roses and there were dark hints of something more to come

On the morning following the receipt of the letter from the Nantucket
lady Captain Eri was busy at his fish shanty putting his lines in
order and sewing a patch on the mainsail of his catboat These necessary
repairs had prevented his taking the usual trip to the fishing grounds
Looking up from his work he saw through the open door Ralph Hazeltine
just stepping out of the cablestation skiff He tucked his sail needle
into the canvas and hailed the young man with a shouted Goodmorning

How do you do Capn Hedge said Hazeltine walking toward the shanty
Good weather isnt it

Tiptop Long s the wind stays westerly and there aint no
Sundayschool picnics on we dont squabble with the weather folks
The only thing that ll fetch a squall with a westerly wind is a
Sundayschool picnic That ll do it sure as death Busy over across

Pretty busy just now The cable parted day before yesterday and Ive
been getting things ready for the repair ship She was due this morning
and were likely to hear from her at any time

You dont say Cable broke hey Now its a queer thing but Ive never
been inside that station since twas built Too handy I guess Ive got
a second cousin up in Charlestown lived there all his life and hes
never been up in Bunker Hill monument yit Fust time I landed in Boston
I dug for that monument and I can tell you how many steps there is in
it to this day If that cable station was fifty mile off Id have been
through it two weeks after it started up but bein jest over there I
aint ever done it Queer aint it

Perhaps youd like to go over with me Im going up to the postoffice
and when I come back I should be glad of your company

Well now thats kind of you I callate I will You might sing out
as you go past Ive got a hafhour job on this sail and then its my
watch below

The cable station at Orham is a low whitewashed building with many
windows The vegetation about it is limited exclusively to beach grass
and an occasional wildplum bush The nearest building which may be
reached without a boat is the lifesaving station two miles below The
outer beach changes its shape every winter The gales tear great holes
in its sides and then as if in recompense throw up new shoals and
build new promontories From the cablestation doorway in fair weather
may be counted the sails of over one hundred vessels going and coming
between Boston and New York They come and go and alas sometimes
stop by the way Then the lifesaving crews are busy and the Boston
newspapers report another wreck All up and down the outer beach are
the sunwhitened bones of schooners and ships and all about them and
partially covering them is sand sand sand as white and much coarser
than granulated sugar

Hazeltines postoffice trip and other errands had taken much more
time than he anticipated and more than two hours had gone by before
he called for Captain Eri During the row to the beach the electrician
explained to the Captain the processes by which a break in the cable is
located and repaired

You see he said as soon as the line breaks we set about finding
where it is broken To do this we use an instrument called the
Wheatstone bridge In this case the break is about six hundred miles
from the American shore The next thing is to get at the companys
repair ship She lies usually at Halifax when she isnt busy and
that is where she was this time We wired her and she left for the spot
immediately It was up to me to get ready the testing apparatuswe
generally set up special instruments for testing Judging by the
distance the ship should have been over the break early this morning
She will grapple for the broken cable ends and as soon as she catches
our end shell send us a message Its simple enough

Like takin wormwood teaeasy enough if youve been brought up that
way I think Id make more money catchin codfish myself commented
the Captain dryly

Ralph laughed Well it really is a very simple matter he said The
only thing we have to be sure of is that our end of the line is ready
by the time the ship reaches the break If the weather is bad the
ship cant work and so when she does work she works quick I had my
instruments in condition yesterday so were all right this time

They landed at the little wharf and plodded through the heavy sand

Dismallooking place isnt it said Hazeltine as he opened the back
door of the station

Well I dont know it has its good pints replied his companion
Your neighbors hens dont scratch up your garden for one thing What
do you do in here

This is the room where we receive and send This is the receiver

The captain noticed with interest the recorder with its two brass
supports and the little glass tube half filled with ink that when
the cable was working wrote the messages upon the paper tape traveling
beneath it

Pretty nigh as finicky as a watch aint it he observed

Fully as delicate in its way Do you see this little screw on the
centerpiece Turn that a little one way or the other and the operator
on the other side might send until doomsday we wouldnt know it Ill
show you the living rooms and the laboratory now

Just then the door at the other end of the room opened and a man whom
Captain Eri recognized as one of the operators came in He started when
he saw Hazeltine and turned to go out again Ralph spoke to him

Peters he said where is Mr Langley

Dont know answered the fellow gruffly

Wait a minute Tell me where Mr Langley is

I dont know where he is He went over to the village a while ago

Where are the rest of the men

Dont know

The impudence and thinly veiled hostility in the mans tone were
unmistakable Hazeltine hesitated seemed about to speak and then
silently led the way to the hall

Ill show you the laboratory later on he said Well go up to the
testing room now Then he added apparently as much to himself as to
his visitor I told those fellows that I wouldnt be back until noon

There was a door at the top of the stairs Ralph opened this quietly As
they passed through Captain Eri noticed that Peters had followed them
into the hall and stood there looking up

The upper hall had a straw matting on the floor There was another door
at the end of the passage and this was ajar Toward it the electrician
walked rapidly From the room behind the door came a shout of laughter
then someone said

Better give it another turn hadnt I to make sure If two turns fixes
it so we dont hear for a couple of hours another one ought to shut it
up for a week Thats arithmetic aint it

The laugh that followed this was cut short by Hazeltines throwing the
door wide open

Captain Eri close at the electricians heels saw a long room empty
save for a few chairs and a table in the center Upon this table stood
the testing instruments exactly like those in the receiving room
downstairs Three men lounged in the chairs and standing beside the
table with his fingers upon the regulating screw at the centerpiece
of the recorder was another a big fellow with a round smoothshaven
face

The men in the chairs sprang to their feet as Hazeltine came in The
face of the individual by the table turned white and his fingers fell
from the regulating screw as though the latter were red hot The
Captain recognized the men they were day operators whom he had met in
the village many times Incidentally they were avowed friends of the
former electrician Parker The name of the taller one was McLoughlin

No one spoke Ralph strode quickly to the table pushed McLoughlin to
one side and stooped over the instruments When he straightened up
Captain Eri noticed that his face also was white but evidently not from
fear He turned sharply and looked at the four operators who were doing
their best to appear at ease and not succeeding The electrician looked
them over one by one Then he gave a short laugh

You damned sneaks he said and turned again to the testing apparatus

He began slowly to turn the regulating screw on the recorder He had
given it but a few revolutions when the point of the little glass
siphon that had been tracing a straight black line on the sliding tape
moved up and down in curving zigzags Hazeltine turned to the operator

Palmer he said curtly answer that call

The man addressed seated himself at the table turned a switch and
clicked off a message After a moment the line on the moving tape
zigzagged again Ralph glanced at the zigzags and bit his lip

Apologize to them he said to Palmer Tell them we regret exceedingly
that the ship should have been kept waiting Tell them our recorder was
out of adjustment

The operator cabled the message The three men at the end of the room
glanced at each other this evidently was not what they expected

Steps sounded on the stairs and Peters hurriedly entered

The old mans comin he said

Mr Langley the superintendent of the station had been in the
companys employ for years He had been in charge of the Cape Cod
station since it was built and he liked the job He knew cable work
too from A to Z and though he was a strict disciplinarian would
forgive a mans getting drunk occasionally sooner than condone
carelessness He was eccentric but even those who did not like him
acknowledged that he was square

He came into the room tossed a cigar stump out of the window and
nodded to Captain Eri

How are you Captain Hedge he said Then stepping to the table he
picked up the tape

Everything all right Mr Hazeltine he asked Hello What does this
mean They say they have been calling for two hours without getting an
answer How do you explain that

It was very quiet in the room when the electrician answered

The recorder here was out of adjustment sir he said simply

Out of adjustment I thought you told me everything was in perfect
order before you left this morning

I thought so sir but I find the screw was too loose That would
account for the call not reaching us

Too loose Humph The superintendent looked steadfastly at Hazeltine
then at the operators and then at the electrician once more

Mr Hazeltine he said at length I will hear what explanations you
may have to make in my office later on I will attend to the testing
myself That will do

Captain Eri silently followed his young friend to the back door of the
station Hazeltine had seen fit to make no comment on the scene just
described and the captain did not feel like offering any They were
standing on the steps when the big operator McLoughlin came out of the
building behind them

Well he said gruffly to the electrician Shall I quit now or wait
until Saturday

What

Shall I git out now or wait till Saturday night I suppose youll have
me fired

Then Hazeltines pentup rage boiled over

If you mean that Ill tell Mr Langley of your cowardly trick and have
you dischargedNo I dont pay my debts that way But Ill tell you
thisyou and your sneaking friends If you try another game like
thatyes or if you so much as speak to me other than on business
while Im here I WILL fire youout of the window Clear out

Mr Hazeltine said Captain Eri a few moments later I hope you dont
mind my sayin that I like you fustrate Me and Perez and Jerry aint
the biggest bugs in town but we like to have our friends come and see
us I wish youd drop in once n a while

I certainly will said the young man and the two shook hands That
vigorous handshake was enough of itself to convince Ralph Hazeltine that
he had made at any rate one friend in Orham

And we may as well add here that he had made two For that evening Jack
McLoughlin said to his fellow conspirators

He said hed fire me out of the windowME mind you And by thunder
I believe hed have DONE it too Boys there aint any more con games
played on that kid while Im aroundParker or no Parker Hes white
thats what HE is



CHAPTER V

THE WOMAN FROM NANTUCKET


Conversation among the captains was for the next two days confined to
two topics speculation as to how soon they might expect a reply from
the Nantucket female and whether or not Mr Langley would discharge
Hazeltine On the latter point Captain Eri was decided

He wont be bounced said the Captain now you just put that down in
your log Langley aint a fool and he can put two and two together as
well as the next feller If I thought there was any need of it Id just
drop him a hint myself but there aint so I shant put my oar in But
I wish you two could have heard that youngster talk to that McLoughlin
critter twould have done you good That boys all right

Captain Jerry was alone when the expected letter came He glanced at
the postmark saw that it was Nantucket and stuck the note behind
the clock He did his best to forget it but he looked so guilty when
Captain Perez returned at supper time that that individual suspected
something made his friend confess and a little later when Captain Eri
came in the envelope bearing many thumbprints was propped up against
the sugar bowl in the middle of the table

We didnt open it Eri said Perez proudly We did want to but we
thought all hands ought to be on deck when anything as important as this
was goin to be done

Hes been holdin it up to the light for the last haf hour sneered
Captain Jerry Anybody d think it had a million dollars in it For the
lands sake open it Eri fore he has a fit

Captain Eri picked up the letter looked it over very deliberately and
then tore off the end of the envelope The inclosure was another
sheet of note paper like the first epistle The Captain took out his
spectacles wiped them and read the following aloud


CAPTAIN JEREMIAH BURGESS

Sir I like your looks well enough though it dont pay to put too much
dependence in looks as nobody knows better than me Besides I judge
that picture was took quite a spell ago Anyway you look honest and
I am willing to risk money enough to carry me to Orham and back though
the dear land knows I aint got none to throw away If we dont agree
to sign articles I suppose likely you will be willing to stand half the
fare That aint any more than right the way I look at it I shall come
to Orham on the afternoon train Thursday Meet me at the depot

Yours truly

MARTHA B SNOW

P SI should have liked it better if you was a Methodist but we
cant have everything just as we want it in this world


Nobody spoke for a moment after the reading of this intensely practical
note Captain Eri whistled softly scratched his head and then read the
letter over again to himself At length Captain Perez broke the spell

Jerusalem he exclaimed She dont lose no time does she

Shes pretty prompt thats a fact assented Captain Eri

Captain Jerry burst forth in indignation

Is THAT all youve got to say he inquired with sarcasm after
gittin me into a scrape like this Well now I tell you one thing I

Dont go on your beam ends Jerry interrupted Captain Eri There
aint no harm done yit

Aint no harm done Why how you talk Eri Hedge Heres a woman that
I aint never seen and might be a hundred years old for all I know
comin down here tomorrow night to marry me by main force as you might
say and you set here and talk about

Now hold on hold on Jerry She aint goin to marry you unless you
want her to taint likely More I think of it the more I like the
womans way of doin things Shes got sense theres no doubt of that
You cant sell HER a cat in a bag Shes comin down here to see you and
talk the thing over and I glory in her spunk

Wants me to pay her fare I see myself doin it Ive got ways enough
to spend my money without paying fares for Nantucket folks

If you and she sign articles as she calls it youll have to pay more
than fares said Captain Perez in a matteroffact tone I think same
as Eri does shes a smart woman Well have to meet her at the depot
of course

Well _I_ wont Cheeky thing Let her find out where I am I callate
shell have to do some huntin

Now see here Jerry said Captain Eri you was jest as anxious to
have one of us get married as anybody else You havent got to marry
the woman unless you want to but you have got to help us see the thing
through I wish myself that we hadnt been quite so pesky anxious
to give her the latitude and longitude and had took some sort of an
observation ourselves but we didnt and now weve got to treat her
decent Youll be at that depot along with Perez and me

When Captain Eri spoke in that tone his two cronies usually obeyed
orders Even the rebellious Jerry who had a profound respect for his
younger friend gave in after some grumbling

They sat up until late speculating concerning the probable age and
appearance of the expected visitor Captain Perez announced that he
didnt know why it was but he had a notion that she was about forty
and slim Captain Jerry who was in a frame of mind where agreement
with anyone was out of the question gave it as his opinion that she
was thirty odd and rather plump Captain Eri didnt hazard a guess but
suggested that they wait and see

But even Captain Eris calmness was more or less assumed for he did not
go fishing the next morning but stayed about the house whittling at
the model of a clipper ship and tormenting Captain Jerry The model was
one that he had been at work upon at odd times ever since he gave up
seagoing It had never been completed for the very good reason that
when one part was finished the Captain tore another part to pieces and
began over again It was a sort of barometer of his feelings and when
his companions saw him take down the clipper and go to work they knew
he was either thinking deeply upon a perplexing problem or was troubled
in his mind

Captain Perez sang a good deal principally confining his musical
efforts to a ballad with a chorus of

  Storm along John
  John storm along
  Aint I glad my days works done

Also he glanced at his watch every few minutes and then went to consult
the chronometer to make sure of the time

Captain Jerry went up to the schoolhouse and gave its vacant rooms a
thorough sweeping for no particular reason except to be doing something
His appetite was poor and he actually forgot to feed Lorenzo a
hitherto unheardof slight and one that brought down upon him a long
lecture from Captain Eri who vowed that loss of memory was a sure sign
of lovesickness

They started for the railway station immediately after supper As they
passed John Baxters house they noticed a light in an upper chamber and
wondered if the old man was ill Captain Eri would have stopped to find
out but Captain Perez insisted that it could be done just as well when
they came back and expressed a fear that they might miss the train
Captain Jerry hadnt spoken since they left home and walked gloomily
ahead with his hands in his pockets

Mr Web Saunders fat and in his pinkstriped shirtsleeves sat upon
the steps of his saloon as they went by He wished them an unctuous
goodevening The oily smoothness of Mr Saunders voice cannot be
described with plain pen and ink it gurgled with sweetness like
molasses poured from a jug This was not a special tone put on for the
occasion no one except his wife ever heard him speak otherwise

The response from the three captains was not enthusiastic but Mr
Saunders continued to talk of the weather the fishing and the
cranberry crop until a customer came and gave them a chance to get away

Slick slick slick commented Captain Eri as they hurried along
Blessed if he dont pretty nigh purr I like a cat fustrate but Im
always suspicious of a catman You know hes got claws but you cant
tell where hes goin to use em When a feller like that comes slidin
around and rubbin his head against my shin I always feel like keepin
tother foot ready for a kick Youre pretty sartin to need it one time
or another

The train was nearly an hour late this evening owing to a hot box and
the exseafaring man and his two friends peered anxiously out at it
from around the corner of the station The one coach stopped directly
under the lights and they could see the passengers as they came down
the steps Two or three got out but these were men Then came an
apparition that caused Captain Jerry to gasp and clutch at Perez for
support

Down the steps of the car came a tall coalblack negress and in her
hand was a canvas extension case on the side of which was blazoned in
twoinch letters the fateful name M B Snow Nantucket

Captain Eri gazed at this astounding spectacle for a full thirty
seconds Then he woke up

Godfrey domino he ejaculated BLACK BLACK Run Run for your lives
fore she sees us

This order was superfluous Captain Jerry was already halfway to the
fence and going at a rate which bid fair to establish a record for
his age The others fell into his wake and the procession moved across
country like a steeplechase

They climbed over stone walls and splashed into meadows They took every
short cut between the station and their home As they came in sight of
the latter Captain Perez breath gave out almost entirely

Heave to he gasped Heave to or Ill founder I wouldnt run
another step for all the darkies in the West Indies

Captain Eri paused but it was only after a struggle that Captain Jerry
was persuaded to halt

I shant do it Eri he vowed wildly I shant do it There aint no
use askin me I wont marry that black woman I wont by thunder

There there Jerry said Captain Eri soothingly Nobody wants you
to There aint no danger now She didnt see us

Aint no danger There you go again Eri Hedge Shell ask where I live
and come right down in the depot wagon Oh Lordy Lordy

The frantic sacrifice was about to bound away again when Captain Eri
caught him by the arm

Ill tell you what he said well scoot for Eldredges shanty and
hide there till she gits tired and goes away Praps she wont come
anyhow

The deserted fish shanty property of the heirs of the late Nathaniel
Eldredge was situated in a hollow close to the house In a few moments
the three were inside with a sawhorse against the door Then Captain
Eri pantingly sat down on an overturned bucket and laughed until the
tears came into his eyes

Thats it laff almost sobbed Captain Jerry Set there and teehee
like a Bedlamite Its what you might expect Wait till the rest of the
town finds out about this theyll do the laffin then and you wont
feel so funny Well never hear the last of it in this world If that
darky comes down here IllIll drown her I will

I dont blame Jerry said Perez indignantly I dont see much to laff
at Oh my soul and body there she comes now

They heard the rattle of a heavy carriage and crowding together at the
cobwebbed window saw the black shape of the depot wagon rock past
They waited breathless until they saw it go back again up the road

Did you lock the diningroom door Perez asked Captain Eri

Course I didnt Why should I

It was a rather senseless question Nobody locks doors in Orham except
at bedtime

Humph grunted Captain Eri Shell see the light in the dining room
and go inside and wait more n likely Well theres nothin for us to
do but to stay here for a while and then if she aint gone one of
us ll have to go up and tell her she wont suit and pay her fare home
thats all I think Jerry ought to be the one he added mischievously
He bein the bridegroom as you might say

Me almost shouted the frantic Captain Jerry You go to grass You
fellers got me into this scrape and now lets see you git me out of it
I dont stir one step

They sat there in darkness the silence unbroken save for an occasional
chuckle from the provoking Eri Perez however was meditating and
observed after a while

Snow Thats a queer name for a darky aint it

That colored man up at Barrys place was named White said Captain
Jerry and he was black as your hat Names dont count

They say colored folks make good cooks Jerry slyly remarked Eri
Maybe youd better think it over

The unlucky victim of chance did not deign an answer and the minutes
crept slowly by After a long while they heard someone whistling Perez
went to the window to take an observation

Its a man he said disappointedly Hes been to our house too My
land I hope he didnt go in Its that feller Hazeltine thats who
tis

Is it exclaimed Eri eagerly Thats so so tis Lets give him a
hail

Before he could be stopped he had pulled the sawhorse from the door
had opened the latter a little way and with his face at the opening
was whistling shrilly

The electrician looked up and down the dark road in a puzzled sort of
way but evidently could not make up his mind from what quarter the
whistles came

Mr Hazeltine hailed the Captain in what might be called a whispered
yell or a shouted whisper Mr Hazeltine Here on your lee bow In the
shanty

The word shanty was the only part of the speech that brought light to
Ralphs mind but that was sufficient he came down the hill left the
road and plunged through the blackberry vines to the door

Who is it he asked Why hello Captain What on earth

Captain Eri signaled him to silence and then catching his arm pulled
him into the shanty and shut the door Captain Jerry hastened to set the
sawhorse in place again

Mr Hazeltine said Captain Eri let me make you acquainted with
Capn Perez and Capn Jerry shipmates of mine Youve heard me speak of
em

Ralph in the darkness shook two big hands and heard whispered voices
express themselves as glad to know him

You see continued Eri in a somewhat embarrassed fashion were sort
of layin to as yer might say waitin to git our bearins We aint
out of our heads I tell you that cause I know thats what it looks
like

The bewildered Hazeltine laughed and said he was glad to hear it
To tell the truth he had begun to think that something or other had
suddenly driven his nearest neighbors crazy

III dont know how to explain it to you the Captain stumbled on
Fact is I guess I wont jest yit if you dont mind It does sound
so pesky ridiclous although it aint when you understand it What we
want to know is have you been to our house and is there anybody there

Why yes Ive been there I rowed over and dropped in for a minute
as you suggested the other day The housekeeperI suppose it was the
housekeeperthat opened the door said you were out and I

He was interrupted by a hopeless groan

I knew it wailed Captain Jerry I knew it And you said there want
no danger Eri

Hush up Jerry a minute for the love of goodness What was she doin
Mr Hazeltine this woman you thought was the housekeeper Did she look
as if she was gettin ready to go out Did she have her bunnit on

No She seemed to be very much at home Thats why I thought

But again Captain Jerry broke in Well by mighty he ejaculated
Thats nice now aint it SHE goin away You bet she aint Shes
goin to stay there and wait if its forever Shes got too good a
thing Jest as like s not Mlissy Busteed or some other gab machine
like her ll be the next one to call and if they see that great black
critter Oh my soul

Black said Ralph amazedly Why the woman at your house isnt black
Shes as white as I am and not badlooking for a woman of her age

WHAT This was the trio in chorus Then Captain Eri said

Mr Hazeltine now honest and true is that a fact

Of course its a fact

The Captain wiped his forehead Mr Hazeltine he said if anybody
had told me a fortnt ago that I was one of the three biggest fools in
Orham Id have probly rared up some As tis now I callate Id thank
him for lettin me off so easy Youll have to excuse us tonight Im
afraid Were in a ridiclous scrape that weve got to git out of all
alone Ill tell you bout it some day Jest now wish youd keep this
kind of quiet to oblige me

Hazeltine saw that this was meant as a gentle hint for his immediate
departure and although he had a fair share of curiosity felt there
was nothing else to do He promised secrecy promised faithfully to call
again later in the week and then the sawhorse having been removed by
Captain PerezCaptain Jerry was apparently suffering from a sort of
dazed paralysishe went away As soon as he had gone Captain Eri
began to lay down the law

Now then he said theres been some sort of a mistake thats plain
enough More n likely the darky took the wrong satchel when she got up
to come out of the car That woman at the house is the real Marthy Snow
all right and weve got to go right up there and see her Come on

But Captain Jerry mutinied outright He declared that the sight of that
darky had sickened him of marrying forever and that he would not see
the candidate from Nantucket nor any other candidate No persuasion
could budge him He simply would not stir from that shanty until the
house had been cleared of female visitors

Go and see her yourself if youre so set on it he declared I
shant

All right said Captain Eri calmly I will Ill tell her youre
bashful but jest dyin to be married and that she can have you if she
only waits long enough

With this he turned on his heel and walked out

Hold on Eri shouted the frantic Jerry Dont you do it Dont you
tell her that Land of love Perez do you spose he will

I dont know was the answer in a disgusted tone You hadnt ought to
have been so pigheaded Jerry

Captain Eri with set teeth and determination written on his face
walked straight to the diningroom door Drawing a long breath he
opened it and stepped inside A woman who had been sitting in Captain
Perez rocker rose as he entered

The woman looked at the Captain and the Captain looked at her She was
of middle age inclined to stoutness with a pair of keen eyes behind
brassrimmed spectacles and was dressed in a black alpaca gown that
was faded a little in places and had been neatly mended in others She
spoke first

Youre not Capn Burgess she said

No maam said the Captain uneasily My name is Hedge Im a sort of
messmate of his Youre Miss Snow

Mrs Snow Im a widow

They shook hands Mrs Snow calmly expectant the Captain very nervous
and not knowing how to begin

I feel as if I knew you Capn Hedge said the widow as the Captain
slid into his own rocker The boy on the depot wagon told me a lot
about you and Capn Ryder and Capn Burgess

Did hey The Captain inwardly vowed vengeance on his chums
grandnephew Hope he gave us a clean bill

Well he didnt say nothin against you if thats what you mean If he
had I dont think it would have made much diffrence Ive lived
long enough to want to find out things for myself and not take folks
sayso

The lady seeming to expect some sort of answer to this statement
Captain Eri expressed his opinion that the plan of finding out things
for ones self was a good idee Then after another fidgety silence
he observed that it was a fine evening There being no dispute on this
point he endeavored to think of something else to say Mrs Snow
however saved him the trouble

Capn Hedge she said as Im here on what you might call a busness
errand and as Ive been waitin pretty nigh two hours already praps
wed better talk about somethin besides fine evenins Ive got to be
lookin up a hotel or boardin house or somewheres to stay tonight and
I cant wait much longer I jedge you got my letter and was expectin
me Now if it aint askin too much Id like to know where Capn
Burgess is and why he want at the depot to meet me

This was a leading question and the Captain was more embarrassed than
ever However he felt that something had to be done and that it was
wisest to get it over with as soon as possible

Well maam he said wewe got your letter all right and to tell
you the truth we was at the depotPerez and me and Jerry

You WAS Well then for the land of goodness why didnt you let me
know it Such a time as I had tryin to find out where you lived and
all

The Captain saw but one plausible explanation and that was the plain
truth Slowly he told the story of the colored woman and the extension
case The widow laughed until her spectacles fell off

Well there she exclaimed If that dont beat all I dont blame
Capn Burgess a mite Poor thing I guess Id have run too if Id have
seen that darky She was settin right in the next seat to me and she
had a shutover bag considrable like mine and when she got up to git
out she took mine by mistake I was a good deal put out about it and
I expect I talked to her like a Dutch uncle when I caught up with her
Dear dear Where is Capn Burgess

Hes shut up in a fish shanty down the road and hes so upsot that I
dunnos hell stir from there tonight Jerry aint prejudiced but that
darky was too much for him

And then they both laughed the widow because of the ludicrous nature
of the affair and the Captain because of the relief that the ladys
acceptance of it afforded his mind

Mrs Snow was the first to become grave Capn Hedge she said
theres one or two things I must say right here In the first place I
aint in the habit of answerin advertisements from folks that wants
to git married I aint so hard up for a man as all that comes to
Next thing I didnt come down here with my mind made up to marry Capn
Burgess not by no means I wanted to see him and talk with him and
tell him jest all about how things was with me and find out about him
and thenwhy if everything was shipshape I might praps think
about

Jest so maam jest so broke in her companion Thats about the
way we felt You see theres probly a long story on both sides and if
youll excuse me Ill go down to the shanty and see if I cant git Jerry
up here Itll be a job Im fraid but

No you shant either Ill tell you what well do Its awful late
now and I must be gittin up to the tavern Spose if taint too much
trouble you walk up there with me and Ill stay there tonight and
tomorrer Ill come down here and well all have a commonsense talk
Praps by that time your friend ll have the darky woman some off his
mind too

Needless to say Captain Eri agreed to this plan with alacrity The
widow carefully tied on a black oldfashioned bonnet picked up a fat
woodenhandled umbrella and the extension case and said that she was
ready

They walked up the road together the Captain carrying the extension
case They talked but not of matrimonial prospects Mrs Snow knew
almost as much about the sea and the goings and comings thereon as did
her escort and the conversation was salty in the extreme It
developed that the Nantucket lady had a distant relative who was in the
lifesaving service at Cuttyhunk station and as the Captain knew every
station man for twenty miles up and down the coast wrecks and maritime
disasters of all kinds were discussed in detail

At the Travelers Rest Mrs Snow was introduced by the unblushing Eri as
a cousin from Provincetown and after some controversy concerning the
price of board and lodging she was shown up to her room Captain Eri
walked home absorbed in meditation Whatever his thoughts were they
were not disagreeable for he smiled and shook his head more than once
as if with satisfaction As he passed John Baxters house he noticed
that the light in the upper window was still burning

Captain Perez was half asleep when Eri opened the door of the shanty
Captain Jerry however was very much awake and demanded to be told
things right away His friend briefly explained the situation

I dont care if she stays here till doomsday emphatically declared
the disgruntled one I shant marry her Whats she like anyhow

He was surprised at the enthusiasm of Captain Eris answer

Shes a mighty good woman thats what I think she is and shed make
a fustclass wife for any man I hope youll say so too when you
see her There aint nothin hitytity about her but shes got more
commonsense than any woman I ever saw But there I shant talk another
bit about her tonight Come on home and turn in

And go home and turn in they did but not without protestation from the
pair who had yet to meet the woman from Nantucket



CHAPTER VI

THE SCHOOLHOUSE BELL RINGS


All hands on deck Turn out there Turnout

Captain Eri grunted and rolled over in his bed for a moment or two he
fancied himself back in the focastle of the Sea Mist the bark in which
he had made his first voyage Then as he grew wider awake he heard
somewhere in the distance a bell ringing furiously

Turn out all hands Turn out

Captain Eri sat up That voice was no part of a dream It belonged to
Captain Jerry and the tone of it meant business The bell continued to
ring

Aye aye Jerry Whats the matter he shouted

Fire Theres a big fire up in the village Look out of the window and
you can see Theyre ringing the schoolhouse bell dont you hear it

The Captain wide awake enough by this time jumped out of bed carrying
the blankets with him and ran to the window Opening it he thrust out
his head The wind had changed to the eastward and a thick fog had come
in with it The house was surrounded by a wet black wall but off to
the west a red glow shone through it now brighter and now fainter The
schoolhouse bell was turning somersaults in its excitement

Only once since Captain Jerry had been janitor had the schoolhouse
bell been rung except in the performance of its regular duties That
once was on a night before the Fourth of July when some mischievous
youngsters climbed in at a window and proclaimed to sleeping Orham that
Young America was celebrating the anniversary of its birth Since then
on nights before the Fourth Captain Jerry had slept in the schoolhouse
armed with a horsewhip and an ancient navy revolver The revolver was
strictly for show and the horsewhip for use but neither was called
into service for even if some daredevil spirits did venture near the
building the Captains snores as he slumbered by the front door were
danger signals that could not be disregarded

But there was no flavor of the Fourth in the bells note this night
Whoever the ringer might be he was ringing as though it was his only
hope for life and the bell swung back and forth without a pause The
red glow in the fog brightened again as the Captain gazed at it

Captain Jerry came tumbling up the stairs breathless and half dressed

Where do you make it out to be he panted

Somewheres nigh the postoffice Looks s if it might be Weekss
store Wheres Perez

Captain Eri had lighted a lamp and was pulling on his boots as he
spoke

Here I be shouted the missing member of the trio from the dining room
below Im all ready Hurry up Eri

Captain Eri jumped into his trousers slipped into a faded peajacket
and clattered downstairs followed by the wildly excited Jerry

Good land Perez he cried as he came into the dining room I
thought you said you was all ready

Captain Perez paused in the vain attempt to make Captain Jerrys hat
cover his own cranium and replied indignantly Well I am aint I

Seems to me Id put somethin on my feet besides them socks if I was
you You might catch cold

Perez glanced down at his blueyarn extremities in blank astonishment
Well now he exclaimed if I haint forgot my boots

Well git em on and be quick Theres your hat Give Jerry his

The excited Perez vanished through the door of his chamber and Captain
Eri glanced at the chronometer the time was a quarter after two

They hurried out of the door and through the yard The wind as has been
said was from the east but there was little of it and except for the
clanging of the bell the night was very still The fog was heavy and
wet and the trees and bushes dripped as if from a shower There was the
salt smell of the marshes in the air and the hissing and splashing of
the surf on the outer beach were plainly to be heard Also there was the
clicking sound of oars in rowlocks

Somebody is comin over from the station gasped Captain Jerry Dont
run so Eri Its too dark Ive pretty nigh broke my neck already

They passed the lily pond where the frogs had long since adjourned
their concert and gone to bed dodged through the yard of the tightly
shuttered summer hotel and came out at the corner of the road having
saved some distance by the shortcut

That aint Weekss store declared Captain Perez who was in the lead
Its Web Saunderss place thats what it is

Captain Eri paused and looked over to the left in the direction of the
Baxter homestead The light in the window was still burning

They turned into the main road at a dog trot and became part of a
crowd of oddly dressed people all running in the same direction

Webs place aint it asked Eri of Seth Wingate who was lumbering
along with a wooden bucket in one hand and the pitcher of his wifes
best washstand set in the other

Yes breathlessly answered Mr Wingate and its a goner they tell
me Every mans got to do his part if theyre going to save it I allers
said we ought to have a fire department in this town

Considering that Seth had for the past eight years persistently
opposed in townmeeting any attempt to purchase a hand engine this was
a rather surprising speech but no one paid any attention to it then

The fire was in the billiard saloon sure enough and the back portion
of the building was in a blaze when they reached it Ladders were placed
against the eaves and a line of men with buckets were pouring water on
the roof The line extended to the town pump where two energetic youths
in their shirtsleeves were working the handle with might and main The
houses near at hand were brilliantly illuminated and men and women were
bringing water from them in buckets tin pails washboilers and even
coalscuttles

Inside the saloon another hustling crowd was busily working to save
Mr Saunders property A dozen of the members had turned the biggest
pool table over on its back and were unscrewing the legs heedless of
the fact that to attempt to get the table through the front door was
an impossibility and that as the back door was in the thickest of the
fire it too was out of the question A man appeared at the open front
window of the second story with his arms filled with bottles of various
liquids original packages and others These with feverish energy he
threw one by one into the street endangering the lives of everyone
in range and of course breaking every bottle thrown Some one of
the cooler heads calling his attention to these facts he retired and
carefully packed all the empty bottles the only ones remaining into a
peach basket and tugged the latter downstairs and to a safe place on a
neighboring piazza Then he rested from his labors as one who had done
all that might reasonably be expected

Mr Saunders himself lightly attired in a nightshirt tucked into a
pair of trousers was rushing here and there now loudly demanding more
water and then stopping to swear at the bottlethrower or some other
enthusiast Webs smoothness was all gone and the language he used
was as Abigail Mullett said afterward enough to bring down a jedgment
on anybody

Captain Eri caught him by the sleeve as he was running past and
inquired Howd it start Web

Howd it START I know mighty well HOW it started and fore I git
through Ill know WHO started it Somebody ll pay for this now you
hear me Hurry up with the water you

He tore frantically away to the pump and the three captains joined the
crowd of volunteer firemen Captain Eri running round to the back of
the building took in the situation at once Back of the main portion of
the saloon was an ell and it was in this ell that the fire had started
The ell itself was in a bright blaze but the larger building in front
was only just beginning to burn The Captain climbed one of the ladders
to the roof and called to the men at work there

That sheds gone Ben he said Chuck your water on the main part
here Maybe if we had some ropes we might be able to pull the shed
clear and then we could save the rest

Howd you fasten the ropes was the panted reply Shes all ablaze
and a rope would burn through in a minute if you tied it anywheres

Git some grapples and anchors out of Rogers shop Hes got a whole lot
of em Keep on with the water busness Ill git the other stuff

He descended the ladder and explained his idea to the crowd below There
was a great shout and twenty men and boys started on a run after ropes
while as many more stormed at the door of Nathaniel Rogers blacksmith
shop Rogers was the local dealer in anchors and other marine ironwork
The door of the shop was locked and there was a yell for axes to burst
it open

Then arose an agonized shriek of Dont chop dont chop and Mr
Rogers himself came struggling to the defense of his property
In concert the instant need was explained to him but he remained
unconvinced

We cant stay here arguin all night roared one of the leaders Hes
got to let us in Go ahead and chop Ill hold him

I give you fair warnin Squealer Wixon If you chop that door Ill
have the law onto you I just had that door painted andSTOP Ive got
the key in my pocket

It was plain that the majority were still in favor of chopping as
affording a better outlet for surplus energy but they waited while Mr
Rogers still protesting produced the key and unlocked the door In
another minute the greater portion of the ironwork in the establishment
was on its way to the fire

The ropeseekers were just returning laden with everything from
clotheslines to cables Half a dozen boat anchors and a grapnel were
fastened to as many ropes and the crowd pranced gayly about the burning
ell looking for a chance to make them fast Captain Eri found a party
with axes endeavoring to cut a hole through the side of the saloon in
order to get out the pool table After some endeavor he persuaded them
to desist and they came around to the rear and taking turns ran in
close to the shed and chopped at it until the fire drove them away At
last they made a hole close to where it joined the main building large
enough to attach the grapnel Then with a Yo heave ho everyone took
hold of the rope and pulled Of course the grapnel pulled out with only
a board or two but they tried again and this time getting it around a
beam pulled a large portion of the shed to the ground

Meanwhile another ax party had attached an anchor to the opposite side
and were making good progress In due time the shed yawned away from the
saloon tottered and collapsed in a shower of sparks A deluge of water
soon extinguished these Then everyone turned to the main building
and as the fire had not yet taken a firm hold of this they soon had it
under control

Captain Eri worked with the rest until he saw that the worst was over
Then he began the search that had been in his mind since he first saw
the blaze He found Captain Jerry and Captain Perez perspiringly passing
buckets of water from hand to hand in the line and calling them to one
side asked anxiously

Have either of you fellers seen John Baxter tonight

Captain Perez looked surprised and then some of the trouble discernible
in Eris face was apparent in his own

Why no he replied slowly I aint seen him now you speak of it
Everybody in towns here too Queer aint it

Havent you seen him either Jerry

Captain Jerry answered with a shake of the head But then he said
Perez and me have been right here by the pump ever sence we come He
might be most anywheres else and we wouldnt see him Want me to ask
some of the other fellers

No exclaimed his friend almost fiercely Dont you mention his name
to a soul nor let em know youve thought of him If anybody should
ask tell em you guess hes right around somewheres You two git to
work agin Ill let you know if I want you

The pair took up their buckets and the Captain walked on from group to
group looking carefully at each person The Reverend Perley and some
of his flock were standing by themselves on a neighboring stoop and to
them the searcher turned eagerly

Why Capn Eri exclaimed Miss Busteed the first to identify him
how youve worked You must be tired pretty nigh to death Aint it
awful But its the Lords doins Im jest as sure of that as I can be
and I says so to Mr Perley Didnt I Mr Perley I says

Lookin for anybody Capn interrupted the reverend gentleman

No lied the Captain calmly jest walkin around to git cooled off a
little Goodnight

There was the most likely place and John Baxter was not there
Certainly every citizen in Orham who was able to crawl would be out
this night and if the old puritan hermit of the big house was not
present to exult over the downfall of the wicked it would be because
he was ill or becauseThe Captain didnt like to think of the other
reason

Mrs Web Saunders quietly weeping was seated on a knoll near the
pump Three of the Saunders hopefuls also weeping but not quietly
were seated beside her Another the youngest of the family was being
rocked soothingly in the arms of a stout female who was singing to it
as placidly as though fires were an every day or night occurrence The
Captain peered down and the stout woman looked up

Why Mrs Snow exclaimed Captain Eri

The lady from Nantucket made no immediate reply She rose however
shook down the black alpaca skirt which had been folded up to keep
it out of the dew and still humming softly to the child walked off a
little way motioning with her head for the Captain to follow When
she had reached a spot sufficiently remote from Mrs Saunders she
whispered

How dye do Capn Hedge I guess the wust is over now isnt it I saw
you workin with them ropes you must be awful tired

How long have you been here asked the Captain somewhat astonished at
her calmness

Oh I come right down as soon as I heard the bell Im kind of used to
fires My husbands schooner got afire twice while I was with him He
used to run a coal vessel you know I got right up and packed my bag
cause I didnt know how the fire might spread You never can tell in
a town like this Sshh dearie to the baby there there its all
right Lay still

Howd you git acquainted with her nodding toward the wife of the
proprietor of the scorched saloon

Oh I see the poor thing settin there with all them children and
nobody paying much attention to her so I went over and asked if I
couldnt help out I havent got any children of my own but I was
number three in a famly of fourteen so I know how its done Oh that
husband of hers Hes a nice one he is Would you blieve it he come
along and she spoke to him and he swore at her somethin dreadful
Thats why shes cryin Poor critter I guess by the looks shes used
to it Well I give HIM a piece of my mind He went away with a flea in
his ear I do despise a profane man above all things Yes the babys
all right Mrs Saunders Im acomin Goodnight Capn Hedge I
spose I shall see you all in the mornin You ought to be careful and
not stand still much this damp night Its bad when youre het up so

She went back still singing to the baby to where Mrs Saunders sat
and the Captain looked after her in a kind of amazed fashion

By mighty he muttered and then repeated it Then he resumed his
search

He remembered that there had been a number of people on the side of
the burning shed opposite that on which he had been employed and he
determined to have one look there before going to the Baxter homestead
Almost the first man he saw as he approached the dying fire was Ralph
Hazeltine The electricians hands and face were blackened by soot and
the perspiration sparkled on his forehead

Hello Captain he said holding out his hand Lively for a while
wasnt it They tell me you were the man who suggested pulling down the
shed It saved the day all right enough

You look as if youd been workin some yourself Was you one of the
fellers that got that anchor in on this side

He was THE one broke in Mr Wingate who was standing at Hazeltines
elbow He waded in with an ax and stayed there till I thought hed burn
the hair off his head Web ought to pay you and him salvage Eri The
whole craft would have gone up if it hadnt been for you two

I wonder if they got that pool table out laughed Ralph They did
everything but saw it into chunks

I never saw Bluey Bacheldor work so afore commented the Captain I
wish somebodyd took a photograph of him Ill bet you could sell em
round town for curiosities Well I cant be standin here

If youre going home Ill go along with you I may as well be getting
down toward the station The excitement is about over

I aint goin right home Mr Hazeltine Ive got an errand to do
Probly Ill be goin pretty soon though

Oh all right Ill wait here a while longer then See you later
perhaps

The fog had lifted somewhat and as the Captain running silently turned
into the shore road he saw that the light in the Baxter homestead had
not been extinguished The schoolhouse bell had ceased to ring and the
shouts of the crowd at the fire sounded faintly There were no other
sounds

Up the driveway Captain Eri hurried There were no lights in the lower
part of the house and the diningroom door was locked The kitchen
door however was not fastened and the Captain opened it and entered
Shutting it carefully behind him he groped along to the entrance of the
next room

John he called softly There was no answer and the house was
perfectly still save for the ticking of the big clock Captain Eri
scratched a match and by its light climbed the stairs His friends
room was empty The lamp was burning on the bureau and a Bible was open
beside it The bed had not been slept in

Thoroughly alarmed now the Captain lamp in hand went through one room
after the other John Baxter was not at home and he was not with the
crowd at the fire Where was he There was of course a chance that his
friend had passed him on the way or that he had been at the fire after
all but this did not seem possible However there was nothing to do
but go back and this time the Captain took the path across the fields

The Baxter house was on the shore road and the billiard room and
postoffice were on the main road People in a hurry sometimes avoided
the corner by climbing the fence opposite the Baxter gate going through
the Dawes pasture and over the little hill back of the livery stable
and coming out in the rear of the postoffice and close to the saloon

Captain Eri worried afraid to think of the fire and its cause and
only anxious to ascertain where his friend was and what he had been
doing that night trotted through the pasture and over the hill Just
as he came to the bayberry bushes on the other side he stumbled and fell
flat

He knew what it was that he had stumbled over the moment that he fell
across it and his fingers trembled so that he could scarcely scratch
the match that he took from his pocket But it was lighted at last and
as its tiny blaze grew brighter the Captain saw John Baxter lying face
downward in the path his head pointed toward his home and his feet
toward the billiard saloon



CHAPTER VII

CAPTAIN ERI FINDS A NURSE


For a second only Captain Eri stood there motionless stooping over
the body of his friend Then he sprang into vigorous action He dropped
upon his knees and seizing the shoulder of the prostrate figure
shook it gently whispering John John There was no answer and no
responsive movement and the Captain bent his head and listened Breath
was there and life but oh so little of either The next thought was
of course to run for help and for a doctor but he took but a few steps
when a new idea struck him and he came back

Lighting another match he examined the fallen man hurriedly The old
ComeOuter lay in the path with his arms outstretched as if he had
fallen while running He was bareheaded and there was no sign of a
wound upon him One coatsleeve was badly scorched and from a pocket in
the coat protruded the neck of a bottle The bottle was empty but its
odor was strong it had contained kerosene The evidence was clear and
the Captain knew that what he had feared was the truth

For a moment he stood erect and pondered as to what was best to do
Whatever it was it must be done quickly but if the doctor and those
that might come with him should find the burned coat and the telltale
bottle it were better for John Baxter that consciousness and life never
were his again There might and probably would be suspicion but here
was proof absolute that meant prison and disgrace for a man whom all the
community had honored and respected

Captain Eri weighed the chances speculated on the result and then did
what seemed to him right He threw the bottle as far away from the path
as he could and then stripped off the coat and folding it into a small
bundle hid it in the bushes near by Then he lifted the limp body and
turned it so that the gray head was toward the billiard saloon instead
of from it

Perez and Jerry were still busy with the water buckets when their friend
came panting up the knoll to the pump

Hello Eri said the former wiping his forehead with his arm Its
bout out aint it Why whats the matter

Nothin nothin to speak of Put down them buckets and you and Jerry
come with me Ive got somethin that I want you to do

Nodding and exchanging congratulations with acquaintances in the crowd
on the success of the firefighting Captain Eri led his messmates to a
dark corner under a clump of trees Then he took each of them by the arm
and whispered sharply

Dr Palmers somewheres in this crowd I want each of you fellers to go
diffrent ways and look for him Whichever one finds him fust can bring
him up to the corner by the postoffice Whistle when you git there and
the rest of us ll come Dont stop to ask questions I aint hurt but
John Baxters had a stroke or somethin I cant tell you no more now
Hurry And say dont you mention to a soul what the matter is

A seafaring life has its advantages It teaches prompt obedience for
one thing The two mariners did not hesitate an instant but bolted in
opposite directions Captain Eri watched them go and then set off in
another He was stopped every few moments and all sorts of questions and
comments concerning the fire and its cause were fired at him but he
put off some inquiries with a curt Dont know and others with nods
or negatives and threaded his way from one clump of townspeople to
another As he came close to the blackened and smoking billiard saloon
Ralph Hazeltine caught him by the arm

Hello said the electrician Havent you gone home yet

No not yit Say Ill ask you cause I callate you can keep your
mouth shut if its necessary Have you seen the Doctor anywheres round
lately He was here cause I saw him when I fust come

Who Dr Palmer No I havent seen him Is anyone hurt Can I help

I guess not John Baxters sick butoh Lord Here comes Wingate
Hell talk for a week

Seth panting and excited was pushing his way toward them shouting the
Captains name at the top of his voice

Hey Eri he hailed I want to know if youll sign a petition to git
the town a fire ingyne Ive been talkin to a couple of the slectmen
and they

Oh Mr Wingate interrupted Ralph Mr Mulletts been looking for
you Hes over there by the pump I think

Who Lem Mullett Is that so Hes jest the feller I want to see See
you later Eri

The Captain grinned appreciatively as the convert to the handengine
proposal disappeared

That wasnt so bad he said Im much obliged Hey Theres the
whistle Come on Mr Hazeltine if you aint in a special hurry Maybe
we WILL need you

They reached the corner by the postoffice to find Dr Palmer who had
practiced medicine in Orham since he received his diploma waiting for
them Captain Perez who had discovered the physician on the Nickerson
piazza was standing close by with his fingers in his mouth whistling
with the regularity of a foghorn

Cut it short Perez commanded Eri Were here now

Yes but Jerry aint And the whistling began again

Dry up for the lands sake Dyou want to fetch the whole tribe here
Theres Jerry now Come on Doctor

John Baxter was lying just as the Captain had left him and the others
watched anxiously as the doctor listened at the parted lips and thrust
his hand inside the faded blue waistcoat

Hes alive he said after a moment but unconscious We must get him
home at once

He heard the bell and was runnin to the fire when he was took said
Captain Jerry Run out in his shirt sleeves and was took when he got
as fur as here

Thats the way I figger it said Eri unblushingly Lift him
carefully you fellers Now then

I warned him against overexertion or excitement months ago said the
Doctor as they bore the senseless burden toward the big house now as
black as the grave that was so near its owner We must find someone
to take care of him at once I dont believe the old man has a relation
within a hundred miles

Why dont we take him to our house suggested Captain Jerry
Twouldnt seem so plaguey lonesome anyhow

By mighty ejaculated Captain Eri in astonishment Well Jerry Ill
be switched if you aint right down brilliant once in a while Of course
we will He can have the spare room Why didnt I think of that I
wonder

And so John Baxter who had not paid a visit in his native village since
his wife died came at last to his friends home to pay what seemed
likely to be a final one They carried him up the stairs to the spare
room as dismal and cheerless as spare rooms in the country generally
are undressed him as tenderly as their rough hands would allow robed
him in one of Captain Jerrys nightshirtsthe buttons that fastened
it had been sewed on by the Captain himself and were all sizes and
colorsand laid him in the big corded bedstead The Doctor hastened
away to procure his medicine case Ralph Hazeltine having been
profusely thanked for his services and promising to call the next day
went back to the station and the three captains sat down by the bedside
to watch and wait

Captain Eri was too much perturbed to talk but the other two although
sympathetically sorry for the sufferer were bursting with excitement
and curiosity

Well if THIS aint been a night exclaimed Captain Jerry Seems if
everything happened at once Fust that darky and then the fire and then
this Dont it beat all

Eri said Captain Perez anxiously was John layin jest the same way
when you found him as he was when we come

Right in the same place was the answer

I didnt say in the same place I asked if he was layin the same way

He hadnt moved a muscle Laid jest as if he was dead

It will be noticed that Captain Eri was adhering strictly to the
truth Luckily Perez seemed to be satisfied for he asked no further
questions but observed Its a good thing weve got a crowd to swear
how we found him Theres a heap of folks in this town would be sayin
he set that fire if twant for that

Some of em will be sayin it anyhow remarked Jerry

Some folks ll say anything but their prayers snapped Eri savagely
They wont say it while Im around And look here if you hear anybody
sayin it you tell em its a lie If that dont keep em quiet let me
know

Oh all right WE know he didnt set it I was jest sayin

Well dont say it

My youre techy Guess fires and colored folks dont agree with you
What are we goin to do now If John dont die and the Lord knows I
hope he wont hes likely to be sick here a long spell Who are we
goin to git to take care of him Thats what I want to know Somebodys
got to do it and we aint fit If Jerry d only give in and git married
now

But Captain Jerrys protest against matrimony was as obstinate as ever
Even Perez gave up urging after a while and conversation lagged again
In a few minutes the Doctor came back and his examination of the
patient and demands for glasses of water teaspoons and the like kept
Perez and Jerry busy It was some time before they noticed that Captain
Eri had disappeared Even then they did not pay much attention to the
circumstance but watched the physician at work and questioned him
concerning the nature of their guests illness

Dyou think hell die Doctor inquired Jerry in a hushed voice as
they came out of the sick room into the connecting chamber

Cant say He has had a stroke of paralysis and there seem to be
other complications If he regains consciousness I shall think he has a
chance but not a very good one His pulse is a little stronger I dont
think hell die tonight but if he lives he will need a good nurse and
I dont know of one in town

Nor me neither said Captain Perez

Well Ant Zuby might come suggested Jerry but I should hate to
have her nuss me and as for bein WELL in a house where she waswhew

Ant Zuby sneered his messmate If Lorenzo had a fit and they called
Ant Zuby hed have another one and die Ant Zuby Id bout as soon
have Mlissy and be done with it

Yes I dont doubt YOU WOULD was the anything but gentle retort

What Perez would have said to this thrust must be surmised for just
then the diningroom door opened and closed again

Theres Eri said Captain Jerry Then he added in an alarmed whisper
Who on airth has he got with him

They heard their friends voice warning someone to be careful of the top
step and then the chamber door opened and Captain Eri appeared There
were beads of perspiration on his forehead and he was carrying a shabby
canvas extensioncase Captain Jerry gazed at the extensioncase with
bulging eyes

Captain Eri put down the extensioncase and opened the door wide A
woman came in a stout woman dressed in black alpaca and wearing
brassrimmed spectacles Captain Jerry gasped audibly

Dr Palmer said Captain Eri let me make you acquainted with Mrs
Snow of Nantucket Mrs Snow this is Dr Palmer

The Doctor and the lady from Nantucket shook hands the former with a
puzzled expression on his face

Perez continued the Captain let me make you known to Mrs
SnowMrs Marthy B Snowthis with especial emphasisof
Nantucket Mrs Snow this is Capn Perez Ryder

They shook hands Captain Perez managed to say that he was glad to meet
Mrs Snow Captain Jerry said nothing but he looked like a criminal
awaiting the fall of the drop

Doctor continued the Captain paying no attention to the signals of
distress displayed by his friend I heard you say a spell ago that
John here needed somebody to take care of him Well Mrs Snowshes
aasort of relation of Jerrysjust a suspicion of a smile
accompanied this assertionand shes done considrable nussin in her
time Ive been talkin the thing over with her and shes willin to
look out for John till he gits better

The physician adjusted his eyeglasses and looked the volunteer nurse
over keenly The lady paid no attention to the scrutiny but calmly
removed her bonnet and placed it on the bureau The room was Captain
Eris and the general disarrangement of everything movable was only a
little less marked than in those of his companions Mrs Snow glanced
over the heap of odds and ends on the bureau and picked up a comb There
were some teeth in it but they were distant neighbors

I dont use that comb very much said Captain Eri rather
apologetically I ginrally use the one downstairs

The newfound relative of Captain Jerry said nothing but laying down
the ruin marched over to the extensioncase opened it and took
out another comba whole one With this she arranged the hair on her
forehead It the hair was parted in the middle and drawn back smoothly
at the sides and Captain Eri noticed that it was brown with a little
gray in it When the last stray wisp was in place she turned calmly to
the Doctor and said

Capn Baxters in here I spose Shall I walk right in

The man of medicine seemed a little surprised at the ladys command of
the situation but he said

Why yes maam I guess you may You have nursed before I think the
Captain said

Five years with my husband He had slow consumption Before that with
my mother and most of my brothers and sisters at one time or another
Ive seen considrable sickness all my life More of that than anything
else I guess Now if youll come in with me sos to tell me about the
medicine and so on

With a short Humph the physician followed her into the sick room
while the three mariners gazed wideeyed in at the door They watched
as Doctor Palmer explained medicines and gave directions It did not
need an expert to see that the new nurse understood her business

When the Doctor came out his face shone with gratification

Shell do he said emphatically If all your relatives are like that
Capn Burgess Id like to know em twould help me in my business
Then he added in response to a question He seems to be a little better
just now I think there will be no change for a while if there should
be send for me Ill call in the morning Gracious its almost
daylight now

They saw him to the door and then came back upstairs Mrs Snow was
busy arranging the pillows setting the room in something like
order and caring for her patients garments that had been tossed
helterskelter on the floor in the hurry of undressing She came to the
door as they entered Captain Eris chamber

Mrs Snow said the Captain youd better sleep in my room here
longs you stay Ill bunk in with Perez downstairs Ill git my dunnage
out of here right off I think likely youll want to clean up some

The lady from Nantucket glanced at the bureau top and seemed about to
say something but checked herself What she did say was

Praps youd better introduce me to Capn Burgess I dont think weve
ever met if we ARE relations

Captain Eri actually blushed a little Why of course he said
Excuse me maam Jerry this is Mrs Snow I dont know whats got
into me bein so careless

The sacrifice shook the nurses hand and said something nobody knew
exactly what Mrs Snow went on to say Now I want you men to go right
on to bed for I know youre all tuckered out We can talk tomorrowI
mean today of course I forgot twas nextdoor to daylight now I
shall set up with Capn Baxter and if I need you Ill call you Ill
call you anyway when I think its time Goodnight

They protested of course but the lady would not listen She calmly
seated herself in the rocker by the bed and waved to them to go which
two of them reluctantly did after a while The other one had gone
already It would be superfluous to mention his name

Downstairs again and in Perez room Captain Eri came in for a
questioning that bade fair to keep up forever He shut off all
inquiries however with the announcement that he wouldnt tell them a
word about it till hed had some sleep Then he would explain the whole
thing and they could decide whether he had done right or not There
were all sorts of things to be considered he said and they had better
take a nap now while they could

Well Id jest like to ask you this Eri Hedge demanded Captain
Jerry What in time did you tell the Doctor that she was a relation of
mine for That was a nice thing to do want it Ill have to answer
more fool questions bout that than a little What sort of a relation
shall I tell folks she is Jest tell me that will you

Oh tell em shes a relation by marriage was the answer muffled by
the bed clothes Maybe that ll be true by the time they ask you

Ill BET it wont snorted the rebel

Captain Perez fell asleep almost immediately Captain Jerry tired out
did the same but Captain Eris eyes did not close The surf pounded
and grumbled A rooster early astir crowed somewhere in the distance
Daniel thumped the side of his stall and then subsided for another nap
The gray morning light brightened the window of the little house

Then Captain Eri slid silently out of bed dressed with elaborate
precautions against noise put on his cap and tiptoed out of the house
He walked through the dripping grass climbed the back fence and
hurried to the hill where John Baxter had fallen Once there he looked
carefully around to be sure that no one was watching Orham as a rule
is an early riser but this morning most of the inhabitants having been
up for the greater part of the night were making up lost sleep and the
Captain was absolutely alone

Assured of this he turned to the bush underneath which he had hidden
the burned coat pushed aside the drenched boughs with their fading
leaves and reached down for the telltale garment

And then he made an unpleasant discovery The coat was gone

He spent an agitated quarter of an hour hunting through every clump of
bushes in the immediate vicinity but there was no doubt of it Someone
had been there before him and had taken the coat away



CHAPTER VIII

HOUSEKEEPER AND BOOK AGENT


There was a knock on the door of Captain Perezs sleeping apartment

Capn Hedge said Mrs Snow Capn Hedge Im sorry to wake you up
but its most ten oclock and

What Ten oclock Godfrey scissors Of all the lazyIll be out in a
jiffy Perez turn out there Turn out I tell you

Captain Eri had fallen asleep in the rocker where he had seated himself
upon his return from the fruitless search for the coat He had had no
intention of sleeping but he was tired after his strenuous work at the
fire and had dropped off in the midst of his worry He sprang to his
feet and tried to separate dreams from realities

Land of love Perez he ejaculated Here you and me have been
sleepin haf the forenoon Wed ought to be ashamed of ourselves Lets
git dressed quicker n chain lightnin

Dressed queried Perez sitting up in bed I should think you was
dressed now boots and all What are you talkin bout

The Captain glanced down at his clothes and seemed as much surprised as
his friend He managed to pull himself together however and stammered

Dressed Oh Im dressed of course Its you Im tryin to git some
life into

Well why didnt you call a feller stead of gittin up and dressin
all by yourself I never see such a critter Wheres my socks

To avoid further perplexing questions Captain Eri went into the dining
room The table was set really set with a clean cloth and dishes that
shone The knives and forks were arranged by the plates not piled in a
heap for each man to help himself The Captain gasped

Well I swan to man he said Has Jerry had a fit or whats struck
him I aint seen him do anything like this for I dont know when

Oh Capn Burgess didnt fix the table if thats what you mean said
the new nurse Capn Baxter seemed to be sleepin or in a stupor like
and the Doctor when he come said I might leave him long enough to run
downstairs for a few minutes so

The Doctor Has the Doctor been here this mornin

Yes he come bout an hour ago Now if you wouldnt mind goin up
and stayin with Capn Baxter for a few minutes while I finish gettin
breakfast Ive been up and down so many times in the last haf hour I
dont knows Im sartin whether Im on my head or my heels

The Captain went upstairs in a dazed state As he passed through what
had been his room he vaguely noticed that the bureau top was clean and
that most of the rubbish that had ornamented it had disappeared

The sick man lay just as he had left him his white face as colorless
as the clean pillow case against which it rested Captain Eri remembered
that the pillow cases in the spare room had looked a little yellow the
night before possibly owing to the fact that as the room had not been
occupied for months they had not been changed He reasoned that the
improvement was another one of the reforms instituted by the lady from
Nantucket

He sat down in the rocker by the bed and thought with a shiver of the
missing coat There were nine chances out of ten that whoever found it
would recognize it as belonging to the old ComeOuter The contents
of the pocket would be almost certain to reveal the secret if the coat
itself did not It remained to be seen who the finder was and what
he would do Meanwhile there was no use worrying Having come to this
conclusion the Captain with customary philosophy resolved to think of
something else

Mrs Snow entered and announced that breakfast was ready and that
he must go down at once and eat it while it was hot She having
breakfasted some time before would stay with the patient until the meal
was over Captain Eri at first flatly declined to listen to any such
arrangement but the calm insistence of the Nantucket visitor prevailed
as usual The Captain realized that the capacity for bossin things
that he had discerned in the letter was even more apparent in the lady
herself One thing he did insist upon however and this was that Mrs
Snow should turn in as soon as breakfast was over One of the three
would take the watch in the sick room while the other two washed the
dishes The nurse was inclined to balk on the dishwashing proposition
saying that she could do it herself after she had had a wink or two
but this the Captain wouldnt hear of He went away however with an
unsettled conviction that although he and his partners might wash
the dishes Mrs Snow would wash them again as soon as she had an
opportunity She didnt say so but she sort of looked it he
explained afterward

He found his friends seated at the table and feasting on hot biscuits
eggs and clear appetizing coffee They greeted him joyously

Hey Eri hailed Captain Perez Aint this gay Look at them eggs
biled jest to a T Aint much like Jerrys haf raw kind

Humph You neednt say nothin Perez observed Captain Jerry his
mouth full of biscuit When you was cook you allers biled em so hard
theyd dent the barn if youd fired em at it Hows John Eri

Captain Eri gave his and the Doctors opinion of his friends condition
and then said Now weve got to have some kind of a settlement on this
marryin question Last night when I was up in the room there it come
acrost me all of a sudden that from what Id seen of this Nantucket
woman shed be jest the sort of nurse that John needed So I skipped
out while you fellers was busy with the Doctor found her at the hotel
explained things to her and got her to come down Thats all there is
to that I aint made no arrangement with her and somethins got to be
done What do you think of her jedgin by what youve seen

Captain Perez gave it as his opinion that she was all right and
added If Jerry here want so pigheaded all at once hed marry her
without waitin another minute

Eri nodded Thats my idee he said emphatically

But Captain Jerry was as obstinate as ever He simply would not consider
immediate marriage In vain his comrades reminded him of the original
compact and the fact that the vote was two to one against him he
announced that he had changed his mind and that that was all there was
about it

At length Captain Eri lost patience

Jerry he exclaimed you remind me of that old white hen we used
to have When we didnt want her to set shed set on anything from a
doorknob to a rock couldnt keep her off but when we give in finally
and got a settin of eggs for her she wouldnt come nigher to em than
the other end of the henyard Now you might as well make up your mind
that somethins got to be done This Mrs Snow aint nobodys fool We
put out a bait that anybody with sense would say couldnt catch nothin
but sculpin and by mighty we hooked a halibut If the woman was
anything like what youd think shed be answerin an advertisement like
that Id be the fust to say let her go but she aint shes all right
and we need her to nuss John besides

Tell you what we might do said Perez slowly we might explain to her
that Jerry dont feel that twould be right to think of marryin with
Capn Baxter so sick in the house and that if shes willin well put
it off till he dies or gets better Meantime well pay her so much to
stay here and nuss Seems to me thats about the only way out of it

So they agreed to lay this proposal before the Nantucket lady Captain
Jerry reluctantly consenting Then Captain Eri took up another subject

John Baxter as has been said had one relative a granddaughter living
somewhere near Boston Captain Eri felt that this granddaughter should
be notified of the old mans illness at once The difficulty was that
none of them knew the young ladys address

Her fust names Elizabeth same as her mothers was said Eri and her
dads name was Preston They called her Elsie John used to write to her
every once in a while Praps Sam would know where she lived

Jest cause Sams postmaster observed Perez it dont foller that he
reads the name on every letter that goes out and remembers em besides

Well if he dont said Captain Jerry decidedly Mary Emma does She
reads everything postals and all

Miss Mary Emma Cahoon was the assistant at the postoffice and was
possessed of a welldeveloped curiosity concerning other peoples
correspondence

Humph exclaimed Captain Eri thats so Well write the letter and
Ill ask Mary Emma for the address when I go up to mail it

So Captain Perez went upstairs to take Mrs Snows place as nurse while
that lady turned in Captain Jerry went into the kitchen to wash the
dishes and Captain Eri sat down to write the note that should inform
Elizabeth Preston of her grandfathers illness It was a very short
note and merely stated the fact without further information Having had
some experience in that line the Captain placed very little reliance
upon the help to be expected from relatives

Dr Palmer had spread the news as he went upon his round of visits that
morning and callers began to drop in to inquire after the sick man
Miss Busteed was one of the first arrivals and as Captain Eri had
seen her through the window he went upstairs and took Perez place
as temporary nurse To Perez therefore fell the delightful task of
entertaining the voluble female for something like an hour while she
talked fire paralysis and general gossip at express speed

Ralph Hazeltine came in a little later and was introduced to Mrs
Snow that ladys nap having been but a short one Ralph was favorably
impressed with the capable appearance of the new nurse and so expressed
himself to Captain Eri as they walked together toward the postoffice

I like her he said emphatically Shes quiet and sensible and
cheerful besides She looks as if trouble didnt trouble her very much

I jedge shes seen enough of it in her time too observed the Captain
reflectively Queer thing how trouble acts different on folks Kind
of like hot weather sours milk but sweetens apples Shes one of the
sweetened kind And yet I callate she can be pretty sharp too if you
try to tread on her toes Sort of a sweet pickle hey and he laughed

Miss Cahoon remembered the Preston girls address It was Cambridge
Kirkland Street but the number she did declare had skipped her mind
The Captain said he would chance it without the number so the letter
was posted Then with the electrician he strolled over to inspect the
remains of the billiard saloon

There was a small crowd gathered about the building prominent among
its members being the train committee who were evidently holding
a special session on this momentous occasion The busy Squealer a
trifle enlivened by some of Mr Saunders wet goods that had escaped
the efforts of the volunteer salvage corps hailed the new arrivals as
brother heroes

Well now Capn Eri he exclaimed shaking hands vigorously And Mr
Hazeltine too Howre you feelin after last night I says to Web I
says Theres folks in this town besides me that kept you from losin
the whole thing and you ought to thank em I says One of em s
Capn Eri and tother ones Mr Hazeltine If we three didnt work then
_I_ dont know I says

Web found out how the fire started yit inquired the Captain with
apparent unconcern

No he haint for sure There was a lot of us thought old Baxter might
have set it but they tell me it couldnt have been him cause he was
took down runnin to the fire Web hes sort of changed his tune and
dont seem to think anybody set it thinks it catched itself

Mr Saunders his smooth self again with all traces of mental
disturbance gone from his face and all roughness from his tongue came
briskly up smiling as if the burning of his place of business was but a
trifling incident a little annoying of course but not worth fretting
about He thanked the Captain and Hazeltine effusively for their service
of the previous night and piled the weight of his obligations upon them
until as Captain Eri said afterwards the syrup fairly dripped off his
chin The Captain broke in upon the sugary flow as soon as he could

How dyou think it started Web he asked

Well replied Mr Saunders slowly I kind of callate she started
herself There was some of the boys in here most of the evenin
and jest likes not a cigar butt or a match or somethin
dropped somewheres and got to smolderin and smoldered along till
bimebypuff An expressive wave of a fat hand finished the sentence

Humph grunted the Captain Changed your mind sence last night Seems
to me I heard you then swearin you knew twas set and who set it

Well yees I was considerable shook up last night and maybe I said
things I hadnt ought to You see theres been a good deal of hard
feelins towards me in town and for a spell I thought some fellerd
tried to burn me out But I guess not I guess not More I think of it
more I think it catched itself Seems to me I remember smellin sort of
a scorchin smell when I was lockin up Oh say I was mighty sorry to
hear bout Capn Baxter bein took sick The old man was dreadful
down on liquor but I laid that to his religion and never had no hard
feelins against him Hows he gittin along

Captain Eri brusquely replied that his friend was bout the same and
asked if Mr Saunders intended to rebuild Web didnt know just yet
He was a poor man didnt carry much insurance and so on Thought
likely he should fix up again if it didnt cost too much Did the Doctor
say whether Captain Baxter would pull through or not

Captain Eri gave an evasive answer and turned away He was silent for
some little time and when Ralph commented on Webs overnight change
of manner his rejoinder was to the effect that ile was bound to rise
but that didnt mean there want dirty water underneath On the way
home he asked Hazeltine concerning the trouble at the cable station and
how Mr Langley had treated the matter

Ralph replied that Mr Langley had said nothing to him about it It was
his opinion that the old gentleman understood the affair pretty well
and was not disposed to blame him As for the men they had been as
docile as lambs and he thought the feeling toward himself was not as
bitter as it had been All of which his companion said he was glad to
hear

They separated at the gate and the Captain entered the house to find
Mrs Snow wielding a broom and surrounded by a cloud of dust Perez
was upstairs with the patient and Captain Jerry whose habits had been
considerably upset by the sweeping was out in the barn

That evening the situation was explained to Mrs Snow by Captain Eri in
accordance with the talk at the breakfast table The lady from Nantucket
understood and respected Captain Jerrys unwillingness to discuss the
marriage question while John Baxters condition continued critical and
she agreed to act as nurse and housekeeper for a while at least
for the sum of six dollars a week This price was fixed only after
considerable discussion by the three mariners for Captain Eri was
inclined to offer eight and Captain Jerry but four

When Ralph Hazeltine called late in the afternoon of the following day
the dining room was so transformed that he scarcely knew it The dust
had disappeared the chronometer was polished till it shone the table
was covered with a cloth that was snowwhite and everything movable had
the appearance of being in its place Altogether there was an evidence
of order that was almost startling

Captain Eri came to the door in response to his knock and grinned
appreciatively at his callers look of wonder

I dont wonder youre sprised he said with a chuckle I aint
begun to git over it yit myself and Lorenzos so shook up he aint
been in the house sence breakfast time Hes out in the barn keepin
Danl compny and waitin for the end of the world to strike I
callate

Ralph laughed Mrs Snow he inquired

Mrs Snow answered the Captain It beats all what a woman can do
when shes that kind of a woman Shes done more swabbin decks and
overhaulin runnin riggin than a new mate on a clipper The place is
so allfired clean that I feel like brushin myself every time I go to
set down

Hows Captain Baxter asked Hazeltine

Seems to be some better He come to a little this mornin and seemed
to know some of us but he aint sensed where he is yit nor I dont
blieve he will fur a spell Set down and keep me compny Its my watch
jest now Perez hes over to Barrys Jerrys up to the schoolhouse
and Mrs Snows run up to the postoffice to mail a letter Johns
asleep so I can stay downstairs a little while longs the doors open
Whats the news uptown Web changed his mind agin bout the fire

It appeared that Mr Saunders had not changed his mind at least so
current gossip reported And it may be remarked here that curiously
enough the opinion that the fire caught itself came at last to
be generally accepted in the village For some weeks Captain Eri was
troubled with thoughts concerning the missing coat but as time passed
and the accusing garment did not turn up he came to believe that
some boy must have found it and that it had in all probability been
destroyed There were of course some persons who still suspected John
Baxter as the incendiary but the old mans serious illness and respect
for his former standing in the community kept these few silent The
Baxter house had been locked up and the Captain had the key

Hazeltine and his host chatted for a few minutes on various topics The
gilt titles on the imposing Lives of Great Naval Commanders
having received their share of the general dusting now shone forth
resplendent and the Captain noticed Ralphs eye as it involuntarily
turned toward them

Noticin our library he chuckled Perez property that is Gusty
Black talked him into buyin em Never met Gusty did you No I
guess likely not She lives over to the Neck and dont git down to the
village much Gustys what you call a business woman She always up to
somethin to make a dollar and shes as slick a talker as ever was
I guess She never give Perez no rest till he signed the deed for them
books Told him theyd give literry tone to the shebang Perez started
to read em out loud when they fust come but he had to stop so often to
spell out the furrin names that me and Jerry used to go to sleep That
made him mad and he said literry tone be durned he want goin to
waste his breath readin us to sleep so theyve been on the shelf ever
sence

Ralph laughed So you have book agents too he said

Well weve got Gusty was the reply and shes enough to keep us
goin Gits round reglar as clockwork once a month to collect the two
dollars from Perez Its her day now and I told Perez that that was
why he sneaked off to Barrys You see Gustys after him to buy the
history of Methuselah or some old critter and he dont like to
see her Shes after me too but Im fraid she dont git much
encouragement

After they had talked a little longer the Captain seemed to remember
something for he glanced at his watch and said Mr Hazeltine I
wonder if I could git you to do me a favor I really ought to go down
and see to my shanty Aint been there sence day afore yesterday
and theres so many boys round Im fraid to leave it unlocked much
longer I thought some of the folks would be back fore this but if you
could stay here long enough for me to run down there a minute or two
Id be ever so much obliged Ill step up and see how John is

He went upstairs and returned to report that the patient was quiet and
seemed to be asleep

If you hear him groan or anything he said jest come to the door
and whistle Whistle anyway if you want me Aint nobody likely to
come less its Gusty or the Reverend Perley come to ask bout John
If its a middlin goodlookin young woman with a satchel thats
Gusty Dont whistle tell her Im out Ill be back in a jiffy but
you neednt tell either of them so unless your conscience hurts you TOO
much

After the Captain had gone Ralph took down a volume of the Great
Commanders and sat down in a chair by the table to look it over He
was smiling over the gaudy illustrations and flamboyant descriptions
of battles when there was a step on the walk outside and knock at the
door Which is it he thought Gusty or the Reverend

Obviously it was Miss Black She stood on the mica slab that formed the
step and looked up at him as he swung the door open She had a small
leather bag in her hand just as the Captain had said she would
have but it flashed across Mr Hazeltines mind that the rest of
the description was not a fair one she was certainly much more than
middlin goodlookin

Is Captain Hedge in she asked

Now from his friends hints Ralph had expected to hear a rather sharp
and unpleasant voicecertain disagreeable remembrances of former
encounters with female book agents had helped to form the impression
perhapsbut Miss Blacks voice was mellow quiet and rather pleasing
than otherwise

No said Mr Hazeltine obeying orders with exactitude Captain Hedge
is out just now

Gustysomehow the name didnt seem to fitwas manifestly
disappointed

Oh dear she said and then added Will he be back soon

Now this was a question unprovided for Ralph stammered and then
miserably equivocated He really couldnt say just when the Captain
would return

Oh dear said the young lady again Then she seemed to be waiting for
some further observation on the part of the gentleman at the door None
being forthcoming she seemed to make up her mind to act on her own
initiative

I think I will come in and wait she said with decision And come
in she did Mr Hazeltine not knowing exactly what to do under the
circumstances

Now this was much more in keeping with the electricians preconceived
ideas of a book agents behavior nevertheless when he turned and found
the young lady standing in the middle of the floor he felt obliged to
be at least decently polite

Wont you take a chair he asked

Thank you said the caller and took one

The situation was extremely awkward but Ralph felt that loyalty
to Captain Eri forbade his doing anything that might urge the
selfpossessed Miss Black to prolong her visit so for a time he said
nothing The young lady looked out of the window and Mr Hazeltine
looked at her He was more than ever of the opinion that the middlin
term should be cut out of her description He rather liked her
appearance so he decided He liked the way she wore her hair so simple
an arrangement but so effective Also he liked her dress It was the
first tailormade walking suit he had seen since his arrival in Orham
And worn by a country book agent of all people

Just then Miss Black turned and caught him intently gazing at her
She colored apparently with displeasure and looked out of the window
again Mr Hazeltine colored also and fidgeted with the book on the
table The situation was confoundedly embarrassing He felt that he must
say something now so he made the original observation that it had been
a pleasant day

To this the young lady agreed but there was no enthusiasm in her tone
Then Ralph nervously fishing for another topic thought of the book in
his hand

I was just reading this he said I found it quite interesting

The next moment he realized that he had said what of all things was
the most impolitic It was nothing less than a bid for a canvass
and he fully expected to be confronted with the necessary order blanks
without delay But strangely enough the book lady made no such move
She looked at him it is true but with an expression of surprise and
what seemed to be amusement on her face He was certain that her lips
twitched as she said calmly

Did you I am glad to hear it

This dispassionate remark was entirely unexpected and the electrician
as Captain Eri would have said lost his bearings completely

Yeser yes he stammered Very interesting indeed II suppose you
must take a good many orders in the course of a week

A good many ORDERS

Why yes Orders for the books I mean The booksthe Great Naval
Liveserthese books here

I beg your pardon but who do you think I am

And it was then that the perception of some tremendous blunder began
to seize upon Mr Hazeltine He had been red before now he felt the
redness creeping over his scalp under his hair

Why why Miss Black I suppose that is I

Just here the door opened and Captain Eri came in He took off his cap
and then seeing the visitor remained standing apparently waiting for
an introduction But the young lady did not keep him waiting long

Are you Captain Eri Hedge she asked

Yesm answered the Captain

Oh Im SO glad Your letter came this morning and I hurried down on
the first train Im Elizabeth Preston



CHAPTER IX

ELSIE PRESTON


Perhaps on the whole it is not surprising that Captain Eri didnt
grasp the situation Neither his two partners nor himself had given
much thought to the granddaughter of the sick man in the upper room The
Captain knew that there was a granddaughter hence his letter but
he had heard John Baxter speak of her as being in school somewhere
in Boston and had all along conceived of her as a miss of sixteen or
thereabouts No wonder that at first he looked at the stylishly gowned
young woman who stood before him with one gloved hand extended in a
puzzled uncomprehending way

Excuse me maam he said slowly mechanically swallowing up the
proffered hand in his own mammoth fist but I dont knows I jest
caught the name Would you mind sayin it agin

Elizabeth Preston repeated the visitor Captain Baxters
granddaughter You wrote me that he was ill you know and I

What roared the Captain delighted amazement lighting up his face
like a sunrise You dont mean to tell me youre Lizbeth Baxters
gal Elsie Well Well I want to know If this dont beat all Set down
Take your things right off Im mighty glad to see you

Captain Eris hand with Miss Prestons hidden in it was moving up
and down as if it worked by a clockwork arrangement The young lady
withdrew her fingers from the trap as soon as she conveniently could
but it might have been noticed that she glanced at them when she had
done so as if to make sure that the original shape remained

Thank you Captain Hedge she said And now please tell me about
grandfather How is he May I see him

The Captains expression changed to one of concern

Why now Miss Preston he said your grandpa is pretty sick Oh I
dont mean hes goin to die right off or anything like that he added
hastily I mean hes had a stroke of palsy or somethin and he aint
got so yit that he senses much of what goes on Now I dont want to
frighten you you know but really theres a chancea leetle mite of
a chancethat he wont know you Dont feel bad if he dont now will
you

I knew he must be very ill from your letter said the girl simply I
was afraid that he might not be living when I reached here They told me
at the station that he was at your house and so I came He has been very
good to me and I

Her voice broke a little and she hesitated Captain Eri was a picture of
nervous distress

Yes yes I know he said hastily Dont you worry now Hes better
the Doctor said he was considrably better today didnt he Mr
Hazeltine Why what am I thinkin of Let me make you known to Mr
Hazeltine nextdoor neighbor of ours right acrost the road and he
waved toward the bay

Ralph and Miss Preston shook hands The electrician managed to utter
some sort of formality but he couldnt have told what it was He was
glad when the Captain announced that if Mr Hazeltine would excuse
them he guessed Miss Preston and he would step upstairs and see John
The young lady took off her hat and jacket and Captain Eri lighted a
lamp for it was almost dark by this time As its light shone upon
the visitors face and hair the crimson flush before mentioned
circumnavigated the electricians head once more and his bump of
selfesteem received a finishing blow That any man supposed to possess
two fairly good eyes and a workable brain could have mistaken her for an
Orham Neck book agent by the name of GustyGusty Black Heavens

Ill be down in a few minutes Mr Hazeltine said the Captain Set
still wont you

But Mr Hazeltine wouldnt sit still He announced that it was late and
he must be going And go he did in spite of his hosts protestations

Look out for the stairs cautioned the Captain leading the way with
the lamp The feller that built em must have blieved that savin
distance lengthens out life Come to think of it I wouldnt wonder if
them stairs was the reason why me and Jerry and Perez took this house
They reminded us so of the shrouds on a threemaster

Elsie Preston did her best to smile as her companion rattled on in this
fashion but both the smile and the Captains cheerfulness were too
plainly assumed to be convincing and they passed down the hall in
silence At the open door of the sick room Captain Eri paused

Hes asleep he whispered and remember if he wakes up and doesnt
know you you neednt feel bad

Elsie slipped by him and knelt by the bed looking into the white old
face on the pillow Somehow the harsh lines had faded out of it and it
looked only old and pitiful

The Captain watched the tableau for a moment or two and then tiptoed
into the room and placed the lamp on the bureau

Now I think likely he said in a rather husky whisper that youd
like to stay with your grandpa for a little while so Ill go downstairs
and see about supper No no no he added holding up his hand as the
girl spoke some words of protest you aint goin nowheres to supper
Youre goin to stay right here If you want me jest speak

And he hurried downstairs and into the kitchen clearing his throat with
vigor and making a great todo over the scratching of a match

Mrs Snow returned a few minutes later and to her the news of the
arrival was told as it was also to Perez and Jerry when they came Mrs
Snow took charge of the supper arrangements When the meal was ready
she said to Captain Eri

Now Ill go upstairs and tell her to come down Ill stay with Capn
Baxter till youre through and then praps if one of youll take my
place Ill eat my supper and wash the dishes You neednt come up now
Ill introduce myself

Some few minutes passed before Miss Preston came down When she did so
her eyes were wet but her manner was cheerful and the unaffected way
in which she greeted Captain Perez and Captain Jerry when these two
rather bashful mariners were introduced by Eri won them at once

The supper was a great success It was Saturday night and a Saturday
night supper to the average New Englander means baked beans The
captains had long ago given up this beloved dish because although each
had tried his hand at preparing it none had wholly succeeded and the
caustic criticisms of the other two had prevented further trials But
Mrs Snows baked beans were a triumph So also was the brown bread

I snum exclaimed Captain Perez if I dont blieve Id sooner have
these beans than turkey What do you say Jerry

I dont know but I had assented the sacrifice upon whose countenance
sat a placidity that had not been there since the night of the
matching Specially if the turkey was like the one we tried to cook
last Thanksgivin Member that Eri

Captain Eri his mouth full grunted an emphatic assent

Tell me said Miss Preston who had eaten but little but was
apparently getting more satisfaction from watching her companions did
you three men try to keep house here alone

Yes answered Eri dryly We tried First we thought twas goin to
be fine then we thought wed like it better after we got used to it
finally we decided that by the time we got used to it wed die like the
horse that was fed on sawdust

And so you hired Mrs Snow to keep house for you Well I dont see how
you could have made a better choice shes a dear good woman Im
sure of it And now I want to thank you all for what youve done for
grandfather Mrs Snow told me all about it youve been so kind that
I

Thats all right thats all right hastily interrupted Captain Eri
Pity if we couldnt help out a shipmate weve sailed with for years and
years But youd ought to have tried some of OUR cookin Tell her about
the sugar cake you made Perez The one that killed the yaller chicken

So Captain Perez told it and then their visitor set them all laughing
by relating some queer housekeeping experiences that she and a school
friend had had while camping at Chautauqua Somehow each one felt at
home with her As Captain Eri said afterwards She didnt giggle and
then agin she didnt talk down at you

As they rose from the table the young lady asked a question concerning
the location of the hotel The Captain made no answer at the time but
after a short consultation with the remainder of the triumvirate he
came to her as she stood by the window and laying his hand on her
shoulder said

Now ElsieI hope you dont mind my callin you Elsie but Ive
been chums with your grandpa so long seemss if you must be a sort of
relation of mineElsie you aint goin to no hotel that is unless
youre real set on it Your grandpas here and were here and theres
room enough I dont want to say too much but Id like to have you
blieve that me and Perez and Jerry want you to stay right in this house
jest as longs you stop in Orham Now you will wont you

And so it was settled and Captain Perez harnessed Daniel and went to
the station for the trunk

That evening just before going to bed the captains stood by the door
of the sick room watching Elsie and the lady from Nantucket as they sat
beside John Baxters bed Mrs Snow was knitting and Elsie was reading
Later as Captain Eri peered out of the diningroom window to take a
final look at the sky in order to get a line on the weather he said
slowly

Fellers do you know what I was thinkin when I see them two women in
there with John I was thinkin that it must be a mighty pleasant thing
to know that if youre took sick somebody like that ll take care of
you

Perez nodded I think so too he said

But if this was meant to influence the betrothed one it didnt succeed
apparently for all Captain Jerry said was

Humph Twould take more than that to make me hanker after a stroke of
palsy



And with the coming of Elsie Preston and Mrs Snow life in the little
house by the shore took on a decided change The Nantucket lady having
satisfied herself that John Baxters illness was likely to be a long
one wrote several letters to persons in her native town which letters
although she did not say so were supposed by the captains to deal with
the care of her property while she was away Having apparently relieved
her mind by this method and evidently considering the marriage question
postponed for the present she settled down to nurse the sick man and to
keep house as in her opinion a house should be kept The captains knew
nothing of her past history beyond what they had gathered from stray
bits of her conversation She evidently did not consider it necessary to
tell anything further and on the other hand asked no questions

In her care of Baxter she was more like a sister than a hired nurse No
wife could have been more tender in her ministrations or more devotedly
anxious for the patients welfare

In her care of the house she was neatness itself She scoured and swept
and washed until the rooms were literally spotless Order was Heavens
first law in her opinion and she expected everyone else to keep up to
the standard Captain Perez and Captain Eri soon got used to the change
and gloried in it but to Captain Jerry it was not altogether welcome

Oh cats foot he exclaimed one day after hunting everywhere for his
Sunday tie and at length finding it in his bureau drawer I cant git
used to this everlastin sprucedup busness Way it used to be this
necktie was likely to be most anywheres round and if I looked out in
the kitchen or under the sofy I was jest as likely to find it But now
everythings got a place and is in it

Well thats the way it ought to be aint it said Eri Then all
youve got to do is look in the place

Yes and thats jest it Im always forgittin the place My shoes is
sech a place my hankerchers is sech a place my pipe is sech a place
my terbacker is another place When I want my pipe I look where my shoes
is and when I want my shoes I go and look where I found my pipe How a
fellers goin to keep run of em is what _I_ cant see

You was the one that did most of the growlin when things was the old
way

Yes but jest cause a man dont want to live in a pigpen it aint no
sign he wants to be put under a glass case

Elsies influence upon the house and its inmates had become almost as
marked as Mrs Snows The young lady was of an artistic bent and the
stiff ornaments in the shutup parlor and the wonderful oilpaintings
jarred upon her Strange to say even the waxdipped wreath that hung
in its circular black frame over the whatnot did not appeal to her
The captains considered that wreathit had been the principal floral
offering at the funeral of Captain Perezs sister and there was a lock
of her hair framed with itthe gem of the establishment They could
understand to a certain degree why Miss Preston objected to the
prominence given the spatterwork God bless our Home motto but her
failure to enthuse over the wreath was inexplicable

But by degrees they became used to seeing the blinds open at the parlor
windows the week through and innovations like muslin curtains and vases
filled with late wild flowers came to be at first tolerated and then
liked Elsies notions the captains called them

There were some great discussions on art over the teacups after supper
Miss Preston painted very prettily in watercolors and her sketches
were received with enthusiastic praise by the captains and Mrs Snow
But one day she painted a little picture of a fishing boat and to her
surprise it came in for some rather sharp criticism

Thats a pretty picture Elsie said Captain Eri holding the sketch
at arms length and squinting at it with his head on one side but
if thats Caleb Titcombs boat and I jedge tis it seems to me shes
carryin too much sail What do you think Jerry

Captain Jerry took the painting from his friend and critically examined
it also at arms length

Calebs boat aint got no sech sail as that was his deliberate
comment She couldnt carry it and stand up that way Besides the way
I look at it shes down by the head more n shed ought to be

But I didnt try to get it EXACTLY right said the bewildered artist
The boats sails were so white and the water was so blue and the sand
so yellow that I thought it made a pretty picture I didnt think of the
size of the sail

Well I spose you wouldnt natrally observed Captain Perez who
was looking over Jerrys shoulder But you have to be awful careful
paintin vessels Now you jest look at that picture pointing to the
glaring likeness of the Flying Duck that hung on the wall Jest look
at them sails every one of em drawin fine and them ropes every one
in JEST the right place Thats what I call paintin

But dont you think Captain Perez that the waves in that picture
would be better if they werent so all in a row like a picket fence

Well now that aint it Thats a picture of the A1 twomasted
schooner Flyin Duck and the waves is only thrown in as you might say
The reel thing is the schooner rigged jest right trimmed jest right
and colored jest the way the Flyin Duck was colored You understand
them waves was put there jest cause there had to be some to set the
schooner in thats all

But you neednt feel bad Elsie said Captain Jerry soothingly
Taint to be expected that you could paint vessels like Eben Lothrop
can Eben he used to work in a shipyard up to East Boston once and when
he was there he had to paint schooners and things reely put the paint
onto em I mean so of course when it come to paintin pictures of
em why

And Captain Jerry waved his hand

So as there was no answer to an argument like this Miss Preston gave
up marine painting for the time and began a watercolor of the house and
its inmates This was an elaborate affair and as the captains insisted
that each member of the family Daniel and Lorenzo included should
pose it seemed unlikely to be finished for some months at least

Ralph Hazeltine called on the afternoon following Elsies arrival and
Captain Eri insisted on his staying to tea It might have been noticed
that the electrician seemed a trifle embarrassed when Miss Preston came
into the room but as the young lady was not embarrassed in the least
and had apparently forgotten the mistakenidentity incident his
nervousness soon wore off

But it came back again when Captain Eri said

Oh I say Mr Hazeltine I forgot to ask you did Gusty come
yesterday

Ralph answered rather hurriedly that she did not He endeavored to
change the subject but the Captain wouldnt let him

Well there he exclaimed amazedly if Gusty aint broke her record
Fust time sence Perez was took with the Naval Commander disease that
she aint been on hand when the month was up to git her two dollars
Got so we sort of reckoned by her like an almanac Kind of thought she
was sure like death and taxes And now she has gone back on us Blessed
if I aint disappinted in Gusty

Who is she inquired Mrs Snow One of those bookagent critters

Well if you called her that to her face I expect thered be squalls
but I callate she couldnt prove a alibi in court

Now it may have been Mr Hazeltines fancy but he could have sworn that
there was just the suspicion of a twinkle in Miss Prestons eye as she
asked innocently enough

Is she a young lady Captain Eri

Well she hopes she is was the deliberate answer Why

Does she look like me

Like YOU Oh my soul and body Wait till you see her What made you
ask that

Oh nothing I was a little curious thats all Have you seen her Mr
Hazeltine

Ralph stammered somewhat confusedly that he hadnt had the pleasure
The Captain glanced from the electrician to Miss Preston and back again
Then he suddenly realized the situation

Ho ho he roared slapping his knee and rocking back and forth in his
chair Dont for the lands sake tell me you took Elsie here for Gusty
Black Dont now Dont

He asked me if I had taken many orders remarked the young lady
demurely

When the general hilarity had abated a little Ralph penitently explained
that it was dark that Captain Eri had said Miss Black was young and
that she carried a bag

So I did so I did chuckled the Captain I spose twas natral
enough but oh dear its awful funny Now Elsie youd ought to
feel flattered Wait till you see Gustys hat the one she got up to
Boston

Am I forgiven Miss Preston asked Hazeltine as he said goodnight

Well I dont know was the rather noncommittal answer I think I
shall have to wait until I see Gusty

But Mr Hazeltine apparently took his forgiveness for granted for his
calls became more and more frequent until his dropping in after supper
came to be a regular occurrence Young people of the better class are
scarce in Orham during the fall and winter months and Ralph found few
congenial companions He liked the captains and Mrs Snow and Elsies
society was a relief after a day with the operators at the station Mr
Langley was entirely absorbed in his business and spent his evenings in
his room reading and smoking

So September and October passed and November came School opened in
October and the captains had another boarder for Josiah Bartlett
against his wishes gave up his position as stagedriver and was sent
to school again As the boy was no longer employed at the livery stable
Captain Perez felt the necessity of having him under his eye and so
Josiah lived at the house by the shore a cot being set up in the parlor
for his use His coming made more work for Mrs Snow but that energetic
lady did not seem to mind and even succeeded in getting the youngster
to do a few chores about the place an achievement that won the
everlasting admiration of Captain Perez who had no governing power
whatever over the boy and condoned the most of his faults or scolded
him feebly for the others

John Baxter continued to waver between this world and the next He
had intervals of consciousness in which he recognized the captains and
Elsie but these rational moments were few and although he talked a
little he never mentioned recent events nor alluded to the fire

The fire itself became an old story and gossip took up other subjects
The ComeOuters held a jubilee service because of the destruction
of the saloon but as Web soon began to rebuild and repair their
jollification was shortlived As for Mr Saunders he was the same
unctuous smiling personage that he had formerly been It was a curious
fact and one that Captain Eri noted that he never ceased to inquire
after John Baxters health and seemed honestly glad to hear of the old
mans improvement He asked a good many questions about Elsie too but
received little satisfaction from the Captain on this subject



CHAPTER X

MATCHMAKING AND LIFESAVING


Captain Jerry sat behind the woodshed in the sunshine smoking and
thinking He had done a good deal of the first ever since he was sixteen
years old the second was in a measure a more recent acquirement The
Captain had things on his mind

It was one of those perfect springlike mornings that sometimes come
in early November The sky was clear blue and the air was so free from
haze that the houses at Cranberry Point could be seen in every detail
The flag on the cable station across the bay stood out stiff in the
steady breeze and one might almost count the stripes The pines on
Signal Hill were a bright green patch against the yellow grass The sea
was a dark sapphire with slashes of silver to mark the shoals and
the horizon was notched with sails The boats at anchor in front of the
shanties swung with the outgoing tide

Then came Captain Eri also smoking

Hello said Captain Jerry How is it you aint off fishin a mornin
like this

Somethin else on the docket was the answer Hows matchmakin these
days

Now this question touched vitally the subject of Captain Jerrys
thoughts From a placid easygoing retired mariner recent events had
transformed the Captain into a plotter a man with a deeplaid scheme
as the gentlemanly cigarettesmoking villain of the melodrama used to
love to call it To tell the truth petticoat government was wearing on
him The marriage agreement to which his partners considered him bound
and which he saw no way to evade hung over him always but he had put
this threat of the future from his mind so far as possible He had not
found orderly housekeeping the joy that he once thought it would be but
even this he could bear Elsie Preston was the drop too much

He liked Mrs Snow except in a marrying sense He liked Elsie better
than any young lady he had ever seen The trouble was that between
the two he as he would have expressed it didnt have the peace of a
dog

Before Elsie came a game of checkers between Perez and himself had been
the regular aftersupper amusement Now they played whist Captain Eri
and Elsie against him and his former opponent As Elsie and her partner
almost invariably won and as Perez usually found fault with him because
they lost this was not an agreeable change But it was but one He
didnt like muslin curtains in his bedroom because they were a nuisance
when he wanted to sit up in bed and look out of the window but the
curtains were put there and everybody else seemed to think them
beautiful so he could not protest Captain Perez and Captain Eri had
taken to dressing up for supper to the extent of putting on neckties
and clean collars Also they shaved every day He stuck to the old
twiceaweek plan for a while but looked so scrubby by contrast that
out of mere selfrespect he had to follow suit Obviously two females in
the house were one too many Something had to be done

Ralph Hazeltines frequent calls gave him the inspiration he was looking
for This was to bring about a marriage between Ralph and Miss Preston
After deliberation he decided that if this could be done the pair would
live somewhere else even though John Baxter was still too ill to be
moved Elsie could come in every day but she would be too busy with her
own establishment to bother with the improvement of theirs It wasnt
a very brilliant plan and had some vital objections but Captain Jerry
considered it a wonder

He broached it to his partners keeping his real object strictly in the
background and enlarging upon his great regard for Ralph and Elsie and
their obvious fitness for each other Captain Perez liked the scheme
well enough provided it could be carried out Captain Eri seemed to
think it better to let events take their own course However they both
agreed to help if the chance offered

So when Mr Hazeltine called to spend the evening Captain Jerry
would rise from his chair and with an elaborate cough and several
surreptitious winks to his messmates would announce that he guessed
he would take a little walk or go out to the barn or something
similar Captain Perez would more than likely go also As for Captain
Eri he usually callated he would step upstairs and see how John was
getting along

But in spite of this loyal support the results obtained from Captain
Jerrys wonderful plan had not been so startlingly successful as to
warrant his feeling much elated Ralph and Elsie were good friends and
seemed to enjoy each others society but that was all that might be
truthfully said so far

Captain Jerry therefore was a little discouraged as he sat in the
sunshine and smoked and pondered He hid his discouragement however
and in response to Captain Eris question concerning the progress of the
matchmaking said cheerfully

Oh its comin along comin along Kind of slow of course but you
cant expect nothin diffrent I spose you noticed he was here four
times last week

Why no said Captain Eri I dont knows I did

Well he was and week a fore that twas only three So thats a gain
aint it

Sartin

I didnt count the time he stopped after a drink of water neither That
wasnt a real call but

Oh it ought to count for somethin Call it a haf a time That would
make four times and a haf he was here

Captain Jerry looked suspiciously at his friends face but its
soberness was irreproachable so he said

Well its kind of slow work but as I said afore its comin along
and I have the satisfaction of knowin its all for their good

Yes like the feller that ate all the appledumplins sos his children
wouldnt have the stomachache But say Jerry I come out to ask if
youd mind bein housekeeper today Luther Davis has been after me
sence I dont know when to come down to the lifesavin station and stay
to dinner His sister Pashythe old maid oneis down there and its
such a fine day I thought Id take Perez and Elsie and Mrs Snow and
maybe Hazeltine along Somebodys got to stay with John and I thought
praps you would Id stay myself only Luther asked me so particular
and you was down there two or three months ago When Josiah comes back
from school hell help you some if you need him

Captain Jerry didnt mind staying at home and so Eri went into the
house to make arrangements for the proposed excursion He had some
difficulty in persuading Mrs Snow and Elsie to leave the sick man
but both were tired and needed a rest and there was a telephone at the
station so that news of a change in the patients condition could be
sent almost immediately Under these conditions and as Captain Jerry
was certain to take good care of their charge the two were persuaded
to go Perez took the dory and rowed over to the cable station to see if
Mr Hazeltine cared to make one of the party When he returned bringing
the electrician with him Daniel harnessed to the carryall was
standing at the side door and Captain Eri Mrs Snow and Elsie were
waiting

Ralph glanced at the carryall and then at those who were expected to
occupy it

I think Id better row down Captain he said I dont see how five
of us are going to find room in there

What in a carryall exclaimed the Captain Why thats what a
carryalls for Ive carried six in a carryall fore now Twas a good
while ago though he added with a chuckle when I was considrable
younger n I am now Squeezin didnt count in them days specially if
the girls wanted to go to campmeetin I callate we can fix it You
and mell set on the front seat and the rest in back Elsie aint a
very big package and Perez hes sort of injyrubber hell fit in
most anywheres Lets try it anyhow

And try it they did While it was true that Elsie was rather small
Mrs Snow was distinctly large and how Captain Perez in spite of his
alleged elasticity managed to find room between them is a mystery He
however announced that he was all right adding as a caution

Dont jolt none Eri cause Im kind of hangin on the little aidge of
nothin

Ill look out for you answered his friend picking up the reins All
ashore thats goin ashore So long Jerry Git dap Thousand Dollars

Daniel complacently accepted this testimony to his monetary worth and
jogged out of the yard Fortunately appearances do not count for much in
Orham except in the summer and the spectacle of five in a carryall
is nothing out of the ordinary They turned into the cliff road the
finest thoroughfare in town kept in good condition for the benefit of
the cottagers and the boarders at the big hotel The ocean was on the
left and from the hill by the Barry estateCaptain Perez chargethey
saw twenty miles of horizon line with craft of all descriptions
scattered along it

Schooners there were of all sizes from little mackerel seiners to big
four and fivemasters A tug with a string of coal barges behind it
was so close in that they could make out the connecting hawsers A black
freight steamer was pushing along leaving a thick line of smoke like a
charcoal mark on the sky One squarerigger was in sight but far out

What do you make of that bark Perez inquired Captain Eri pointing
to the distant vessel British aint she

Captain Perez leaned forward and peered from under his hand French
looks to me he said

Dont think so Way shes rigged forard looks like Johnny Bull Look
at that fotopsl

Guess youre right Eri now I come to notice it Can you make out her
flag Wish Id brought my glass

Great Scott man exclaimed Ralph What sort of eyes have you got I
couldnt tell whether she had a flag or not at this distance How do you
do it

Cordin to how youre brought up as the goat said bout eatin
shinglenails replied Captain Eri When youre at sea youve jest got
to git used to seein things a good ways off and knowin em when you
see em too

I remember one time remarked Mrs Snow that my brother
Nathanhes dead nowwas bound home from Hong Kong fust mate on
the bark Dimond King Twas the time of the war and the Alabama was
cruisin round lookin out for our ships Nate and the skippera
Bangor man he waswas on deck and they sighted a steamer a good ways
off The skipper spied her and see she was flyin the United States
flag But when Nate got the glass he took one look and says That
Yankee buntin dont blong over that English hull he says You see
he knew she was English build right away So the skipper pulled down his
own flag and histed British colors but twant no use the steamer
was the Alabama sure enough and the Dimond King was burned and
all hands took prisners Nate didnt git home for ever so long and
everybody thought he was lost

This set the captains going and they told seastories until they came
to the road that led down to the beach beneath the lighthouse bluff The
lifesaving station was in plain sight now but on the outer beach and
that was separated from them by a twohundredyard stretch of water

Well observed Captain Eri heres where we take Adams bridge

Adams bridge queried Elsie puzzled

Yes the only kind he had I callate Git dap Daniel What are you
waitin for Left your bathin suit to home

Then as Daniel stepped rather gingerly into the clear water he
explained that at a time ranging from three hours before low tide
to three hours after one may reach the outer beach at this point
by driving over in an ordinary vehicle The lifesavers add to this
timelimit by using a specially built wagon with large wheels and a
body considerably elevated

Well there now exclaimed the lady from Nantucket as Daniel
splashingly emerged on the other side I thought Id done about
everything a body could do with salt water but I never went ridin in
it afore

The remainder of the way to the station was covered by Daniel at a walk
for the wheels of the heavy carryall sank two inches or more in the
coarse sand as they turned The road wound between sand dunes riven and
heaped in all sorts of queer shapes by the wind and with clumps of the
persevering beach grass clinging to their tops like the last treasured
tufts of hair on partially bald heads Here and there half buried
sandscoured planks and fragments of spars showed relics of wrecks that
had come ashore in past winters

Five years ago remarked Captain Eri there was six foot of water
where we are now This beach changes every winter One good notheaster
jest rips things loose over here tears out a big chunk of beach and
makes a cutthrough one season and fills in a deep hole and builds
a new shoal the next Ive heard my father tell bout pickin
huckleberries when he was a boy off where them breakers are now Good
dry land it was then Hey theres Luther Ship ahoy Lute

The little brown lifesaving station was huddled between two sandhills
There was a small stable and a henhouse and yard just behind it Captain
Davis rawboned and brownfaced waved a welcome to them from the side
door

Spied you comin Eri he said in a curiously mild voice that sounded
odd coming from such a deep chest Im mighty glad to see you too
Jump down and come right in Pashy ll be out in a minute Here she is
now

Miss Patience Davis was as plump as her brother was tall She impressed
one as a comfortable sort of person Captain Eri did the honors and
everyone shook hands Then they went into the living room of the
station

What particularly struck Mrs Snow was the neatness of everything The
brass on the pump in the sink shone like fire as the sunlight from the
window struck it The floor was white from scouring There were shelves
on the walls and on these arranged in orderly piles were canned goods
of all descriptions The table was covered with a figured oilcloth

Two or three men members of the crew were seated in the wooden chairs
along the wall but rose as the party came in Captain Davis introduced
them one after the other Perhaps the most striking characteristic of
these men was the quiet almost bashful way in which they spoke they
seemed like big boys as much as anything and yet the oldest was nearly
fifty

Ever been in a lifesaving station afore asked Captain Eri

Elsie had not Ralph had and so had Mrs Snow but not for years

This is where we keep the boat and the rest of the gear said Captain
Davis opening a door and leading the way into a large lowstudded
room Thems the spare oars on the wall The reglar ones are in the
boat

The boat itself was on its carriage in the middle of the room Along the
walls on hooks hung the mens suits of oilskins and their souwesters
The Captain pointed out one thing after another the cork jackets and
lifepreservers the gun for shooting the life line across a stranded
vessel the life car hanging from the roof and the breeches buoy

I dont blieve youd ever git me into that thing said the Nantucket
lady decidedly referring to the buoy I dont know but Id bout as
liefs be drownded as make sech a show of myself

Took off a bigger woman than you one time said Captain Davis Wife
of a Portland skipper she was and he was on his fust vyage in a
brandnew schooner jest off the stocks Struck on the Hogs Back off
here and then drifted close in and struck again We got em all the
woman fust That was the only time weve used the buoy sence Ive been
at the station Most of the wrecks are too fur off shore and we have to
git out the boat

He took them upstairs to the mens sleeping rooms and then up to the
little cupola on the roof

Why do you have groundglass windows on this side of the house asked
Elsie as they passed the window on the landing

Captain Davis laughed

Well it is pretty nigh groundglass now he answered but it want
when it was put in The sand did that It blows like all possessed when
theres a gale on

Do you mean that those windows were ground that way by the beach sand
blowing against them asked Ralph astonished

Sartin Git a good notherly wind comin up the beach and it fetches
the sand with it Mighty mean stuff to face sand blowin like that is
makes you think youre fightin a nest of yallerjackets

With the telescope in the cupola they could see for miles up and down
the beach and out to sea An ocean tug bound toward Boston was passing
and Elsie looking through the glass saw the cook come out of the
galley empty a pan over the side and go back again

Let me look through that a minute said Captain Eri when the rest had
had their turn He swung the glass around until it pointed toward their
home away up the shore

Perez he called anxiously look here quick

Captain Perez hastily put his eye to the glass and his friend went on

You see our house he said Yes well you see the dininroom door
Notice that chair by the side of it

Yes what of it

Well thats the rocker that Elsie made the velvet cushion for I want
you to look at the upper southeast corner of that cushion and see if
there aint a cats hair there Lorenzos possessed to sleep in that
chair and

Oh you git out indignantly exclaimed Captain Perez straightening
up

Well it was a pretty important thing and I wanted to make sure I
left that chair out there and I knew what Id catch if any cats hairs
got on that cushion while I was gone Aint that so Mrs Snow

The housekeeper expressed her opinion that Captain Eri was a case
whatever that may be

They had clam chowder for dinnera New England clam chowder made with
milk and crackers and clams with shells as white as snow They were
what the New Yorker calls softshell clams for a Fulton Market
chowder is a quahaug soup to the native of the Cape

Now that chowder was good everybody said so and if the proof of the
chowder like that of the pudding is in the eating of it this one had
a clear case Also there were boiled striped bass which is good enough
for anybody hot biscuits pumpkin pie and beachplum preserves There
was a running fire of apologies from Miss Patience and answering volleys
of compliments from Mrs Snow

I dont see how you make sech beachplum preserves Miss Davis
exclaimed the lady from Nantucket I declare Im goin to ask you for
another sasserful I blieve theyre the best I ever ate

Well now Do you think so I kind of suspected that the plums was a
little mite too ripe You know how tis with beachplums theyve got to
be put up when theyre jest so else they aint good for much I was at
Luther for I dont know how long fore I could git him to go over to the
Pint and pick em and I was fraid hed let it go too long I only put
up twentytwo jars of em on that account How much sugar do you use

There was material here for the discussion that country housewives love
and the two ladies took advantage of it When it was over the female
portion of the company washed the dishes while the men walked up and
down the beach and smoked Here they were joined after a while by the
ladies for even by the ocean it was as mild as early May and the wind
was merely bracing and had no sting in it

The big blue waves shouldered themselves up from the bosom of the sea
marched toward the beach and tumbled to pieces in a roaring tumult
of white and green The gulls skimmed along their tops or dropped
like falling stones into the water after sand eels emerging again
screaming to repeat the performance

The conversation naturally turned to wrecks and Captain Davis his
reserve vanishing before the tactful inquiries of the captains and
Ralph talked shop and talked it well



CHAPTER XI

HEROES AND A MYSTERY


Luther Davis had been commandant at the lifesaving station for years
and Number One Man before that so his experience with wrecks and
disabled craft of all kinds had been long and varied He told them
of disasters the details of which had been telegraphed all over the
country and of rescues of halffrozen crews from icecrested schooners
whose signals of distress had been seen from the observatory on the roof
of the station He told of long rows in midwinter through seas the spray
of which turned to ice as they struck and froze the mens mittens to
the oarhandles He told of picking up draggled corpses in the surf at
midnight when as he said You couldnt tell whether twas a man or
a roll of seaweed and the only way to make sure was to reach down and
feel

Captain Eri left them after a while as he had some acquaintances
among the men at the station and wished to talk with them Miss Davis
remembered that she had not fed the chickens and hurried away to
perform that humane duty gallantly escorted by Captain Perez The
Captain by the way was apparently much taken with the plump spinster
and although usually rather bashful where ladies were concerned had
managed to keep up a sort of side conversation with Miss Patience while
the storytelling was going on But Ralph and Elsie and Mrs Snow were
hungry for more tales and Captain Davis obligingly told them

One of the wust wrecks we ever had off here he said was the
Bluebell British ship she was from Singapore bound to Boston and
loaded with hemp We see her about off that pint there jest at dusk
and she was makin heavy weather then It come on to snow soon as it got
dark and blowdont talk Seems to me twas one of the meanest nights
I ever saw Tween the snow flyin and the dark you couldnt see
two feet ahead of you We was kind of worried about the vessel all
eveninfor one thing she was too close in shore when we see her
lastbut there want nothin to be done except to keep a weather eye
out for signs of trouble

Fust thing we knew of the wreck was when the man on patrol up the
beachPhilander Vose twastelephoned from the shanty that a ships
longboat had come ashore at Knowles Cove two mile above the station
That was about one oclock in the mornin Bout hafpast two Sim
Gouldhe was drownded the next summer fishin on the Bankstelephoned
from the shanty BELOW the stationthe one a mile or so tother side of
the cable house Mr Hazeltinethat wreckage was washin up abreast of
where he was that was six miles from where the longboat come ashore
So there we was There want any way of tellin whereabouts she was
layin she might have been anywheres along them six miles and you
couldnt hear nothin nor see nothin But anyhow the wreckage kept
comin in below the cable station so I jedged she was somewheres in
that neighborhood and we got the boat outon the cart of courseand
hauled it down there

Twas a tremendous job too that haulin was We had the horse and
the whole of us helpin him but I swan I begun to think wed never git
anywheres Tween the wind and the sand and the snow I thought wed flap
to pieces like a passel of shirts on a clothes line But we got there
after a spell and then there was nothin to do but wait for daylight

Bout seven oclock the snow let up a little bit and then we see her
There was a bar jest about opposite the cable stationits been washed
away senceand shed struck on that and the sea was makin a clean
breach over her There was a haf a dozen of her crew lashed in the
riggin but I didnt see em move so I presume likely they was froze
stiff then for twas perishin cold But we wrastled the boat down to
the water and was jest goin to launch her when the whole three masts
went by the board men and all We put off to her but she was in a
reglar soapsuds of a sea and awash from stem to stern so we knew there
was nothin livin aboard

Yes siree continued the Captain meditatively that was a mean
night I had this ear frostbit and its been tender ever sence One
of the fellers had a rib broke he was a little light chap and the wind
jest slammed him up against the cart like as if he was a chip And jest
to show you he added how the tide runs around this place the bodies
of that crew was picked up from Wellmouth to Setuckit Pinttwentymile
stretch that is The skippers body never come ashore He had a son
nice young feller that was goin to meet him in Boston and that boy
spent a month down here waitin for his fathers body to be washed up
Hed walk up and down this beach and walk up and down Pitiful sight as
ever I see

And they were all lost asked Elsie with a shiver

Every man Jack But twas curus about that hemp The Bluebell was
loaded with it as I told you and when she went to pieces the tide
took that hemp and strung it from here to glory They picked it up all
longshore and for much as a month afterwards youd go along the main
road over in the village and see it hung over fences or spread out in
the sun to dry Looked like all the blonde girls in creation had had a
haircut

Captain Davis said Ralph you must have seen some plucky things in
your life What was the bravest thing you ever saw done

The life saver took the cigar that Hazeltine had given him from his
mouth and blew the smoke into the air over his head

Well he said slowly I dont know exactly Ive seen some pretty
gritty things done longshore here in the service When theres
somebody drowndin and you know theres a chance to save em youll
take chances and think nothin of em that you wouldnt take if you
had time to set down and callate a little I see somethin done once
that may not strike you as bein anything out of the usual run but that
has always seemed to me clear grit and nothin else Twant savin
life neither twas jest a matter of busness

It happened up off the coast of Maine long in the seventies I was
actin as sort of second mate on a lumber schooner Twas a pitchblack
night or mornin rather bout six oclock blowin like all possessed
and colder n Greenland We struck a rock that want even down on an
Eldredge chart and punched a hole in the schooners side jest above
what ought to have been the water line only she was heeled over so that
twas considerble below it most of the time We had a mean crew aboard
Portugees mainly and poor ones at that The skipper was below asleep
and when he come on deck things was in a bad way Wed got the canvas
off her but she was takin in water every time she rolled and there
was a sea goin that was tearin things loose in great shape We shipped
one old grayback that ripped off a strip of the lee rail jest the same
as youd rip the edge off the cover of a pasteboard boxnever made no
more fuss about it either

I didnt see nothin to do but get out the boats but the skipper he
want that kind He sized things up in a hurry I tell you He drove
the crewhaf of em was prayin to the Virgin and tother haf
swearin a blue streakto the pumps and set me over em with a
revolver to keep em workin Then him and the fust mate and one or two
of the best hands rousted out a spare sail weighted one edge of it to
keep it down and got it over the side made fast of course

Then him and the mate stripped to their underclothes rigged a sort of
bosns chair over where the hole in the side was took hammers and a
pocketful of nails apiece and started in to nail that canvas over the
hole

Twas freezin cold and the old schooner was rollin like a washtub
One minute Id see the skipper and the mate histed up in the air
hammerin for dear life and then swash under theyd go clear under
and stay there seemed to me forever Every dip I thought would be the
end and Id shet my eyes expectin to see em gone when she lifted
but no up theyd come fetch a breath shake the salt water out of
their eyes and go to work again

Four hours and a quarter they was at it four hours mind you and
under water a good haf of the time but they got that sail nailed fast
finlly We got em on deck when twas done and we had to carry the
fust mate to the cabin But the skipper jest sent the cook for a pail
of bilin hot coffee drunk the whole of it put on dry clothes over his
wet flannels and stayed on deck and worked that schooner into Portland
harbor the men pumpin clear green water out of the hold every minute
of the way

Now that always seemed to me to be the reel thing Twant a question
of savin lifewe could have took to the boats and nine chances out
of ten got ashore all right for twant very fur But no the skipper
said hed never lost a vessel for an owner yit and he want goin to
lose this one And he didnt either by Judas No sir

That was splendid exclaimed Elsie I should like to have known that
captain Who was he Captain Davis

Well the fust mate was Obed Simmonshes dead nowbut he used to
live over on the road towards East Harniss The skipperwell he was a
feller you know

Twas Capn Eri said Mrs Snow with conviction

Thats right maam Perez told you I spose

No nobody told me I jest guessed it Ive seen a good many folks in
my time and I callate Ive got so I can tell what kind a man is after
Ive known him a little while I jedged Capn Eri was that kind and
when you said we knew that skipper I was almost sartin twas him

Well exclaimed Ralph I dont believe I should have guessed it
Ive always liked the Captain but he has seemed so full of fun and
so easygoing that I never thought of his doing anything quite so
strenuous

Captain Davis laughed Ive seen fomast hands try to take advantage
of that easygoin way fore now he said but they never did it but
once Capn Eri is one of the finest fellers that ever stepped but you
cant stomp on his toes much and hes clear grit inside And say he
added dont you tell anybody I told that story for hed skin me alive
if he knew it

As they walked back toward the station Ralph and Elsie lingered a little
behind the others and then stopped to watch a big fourmaster that
under full sail was spinning along a mile or two from the beach They
watched it for a moment or two without speaking Elsies cheeks were
brown from the sun stray wisps of her hair fluttered in the wind and
her trim healthy figure stood out against the white sandhill behind
them as if cut from cardboard The electrician looked at her and again
the thought of that disgraceful Gusty Black episode was forced into
his mind They had had many a good laugh over it since and Elsie had
apparently forgotten it but he had not by a good deal

She was the first to speak and then as much to herself as to him

I think they are the best people I ever knew she said

Who he asked

Oh all of them The captains and Mrs Snow and Captain Davis and his
sister They are so simple and kind and generous And the best of it is
they dont seem to know it and wouldnt believe it if you told them

Ralph nodded emphatically

I imagine it would take a good deal to convince Davis or any of these
station men that there was anything heroic in their lives he said As
for Captain Eri I have known him only a month or two but I dont know
of anyone to whom I would rather go if I were in trouble

He has been so kind to grandfather and me said Elsie that I feel
as though we were under an obligation we never could repay When I came
down here I knew no one in Orham and he and Captain Jerry and Captain
Perez have made me feel more at home than I have ever felt before You
know she added grandfather is the only relative I have

I suppose you will go back to your studies when your grandfather
recovers

I dont know If grandfather is well enough I think I shall try to
persuade him to come up to Boston and live with me Then I might perhaps
teach This was to have been my last year at Radcliffe so my giving it
up will not make so much difference Do you intend to stay here long I
suppose you do Your profession I know means so much to you and your
work at the station must be very interesting

It would be more so if I had someone who was interested with me Mr
Langley is kind but he is so wrapped up in his own work that I see very
little of him I took the place because I thought it would give me a
good deal of spare time that I might use in furthering some experiments
of my own Electricity is my hobby and I have one or two ideas that
I am foolish enough to hope may be worth developing I have had time
enough goodness knows but its a lonesome sort of life If it had not
been for the captainsand youI think I should have given it up before
this

Oh I hope you wont

Why

Whywhy because it seems like running away almost doesnt it If
a thing is hard to do but is worth doing I think the satisfaction IN
doing it is ever so much greater dont you I know it must be lonely
for you but then it is lonely for Mr Langley and the other men
too

I doubt if Mr Langley would be happy anywhere else and the other men
are married most of them and live over in the village

Now there isnt any real reason why this simple remark should have
caused a halt in the conversation but it did Miss Preston said Oh
indeed rather hurriedly and her next speech was concerning the height
of a particularly big wave Mr Hazeltine answered this commonplace
somewhat absentmindedly He acted like a man to whom a startling idea
had suddenly occurred Just then they heard Captain Eri calling them

The Captain was standing on a sand dune near the station shouting their
names through a speaking trumpet formed by placing his hands about his
mouth As the pair came strolling toward him he shifted his hands to
his trousers pockets and stood watching the young couple with a sort of
half smile

I spose if Jerry was here now he mused hed think his scheme was
workin Well maybe tis maybe tis You cant never tell Well I
swan

The exclamation was called forth by the sight of Captain Perez and Miss
Patience who suddenly came into view around the corner of the station
The Captain was gallantly assisting his companion over the rough places
in the path and she was leaning upon his arm in a manner that implied
implicit confidence Captain Eri glanced from one couple to the other
and then grinned broadly The grin had not entirely disappeared when
Captain Perez came up and the latter rather crisply asked what the joke
was

Oh nothin was the reply I was jest thinkin we must be playin
some kind of a game and I was It

It queried Miss Patience puzzled

Why yes Im kinder like Rastus Bailey used to be at the dances
when you and me was younger Perez Old man Alexanderhe was the
fiddlerused to sing out Choose partners for Hulls Victry or
somethin like that and it always took Ras so long to make up his mind
what girl to choose that he ginrally got left altogether Then hed
set on the settee all through the dance and say he never cared much for
Hulls Victry anyway Seems to me Im the only one that aint choosed
partners How bout it Perez

More fool you thats all Ive got to say replied Captain Perez
stoutly

Miss Patience laughed so heartily at this rejoinder that Perez began
to think he had said a very good thing indeed and so repeated it for
greater effect

You want to look out for him Miss Davis said Captain Eri Hes the
most fascinatin youngster of his age I ever see Me and Jerrys been
thinkin wed have to build a fence round the house to keep the girls
away when hes home Why Mlissy Busteed fairly

Oh give us a rest Eri exclaimed Perez with even more indignation
than was necessary Mlissy Busteed

Just then Ralph and Elsie came up and Captain Eri explained that he had
hailed them because it was time to be going if they wanted to get across
to the mainland without swimming They walked around to the back door of
the station and there found Mrs Snow and Captain Davis by the henyard
The lady from Nantucket had discovered a sick chicken in the collection
and she was holding it in her lap and at the same time discoursing
learnedly on the relative value of Plymouth Rocks and Rhode Island Reds
as layers

See there exclaimed Captain Eri delightedly pointing to the
suffering pullet what did I tell you Dyou wonder we picked her out
for nuss for John Luther Even a sick hen knows enough to go to her

They harnessed Daniel to the carryall and stowed the living freight
aboard somehow although Captain Perez protested that he had eaten so
much dinner he didnt knows hed be able to hang on the way he did
coming down Then they said farewell to Captain Davis and his sister and
started for home The members of the crew such of them as were about
the station waved goodby to them as they passed

Things kind of average up in this world dont they said Captain Eri
reflectively as he steered Daniel along the soft beach toward the ford
Were all the time readin bout fellers that work for the Govment
gittin high salries and doin next to nothin Now theres a gangthe
lifesavin crew I meanthat does what you and me would call almighty
hard work and git next to nothin for it Uncle Sam gits square there
it seems to me A few dollars a month and find yourself aint giltedged
wages for bein froze and drownded and blown to pieces ten months out of
the year is it

The tide was higher when they came to the crossing than it had been when
they drove over before but they made the passage all right although
there was some nervousness displayed by the feminine portion of the
party When they reached home they found Captain Jerry contentedly
smoking his pipe the sick man was asleep and everything was serene
Josiah appeared from behind the barn where he had been smoking a
cigarette

They pressed Mr Hazeltine to stay to supper but he declined alleging
that he had been away from business too long already He had been
remarkably silent during the homeward ride and Elsie too had seemed
busy with her thoughts She was full of fun at the supper table
however and the meal was a jolly one Just as it was finished Captain
Jerry struck the table a bang with his palm that made the knives and
forks jump and so startled Captain Perez as to cause him to spill half
a cup of tea over his shirt bosom

Land of love ejaculated the victim mopping his chin and his tie
with his napkin Its bad enough to scare a feller to death let alone
drowndin and scaldin him at the same time What did you do that for

I jest thought of somethin exclaimed Captain Jerry going through
one pocket after the other

Well I wish youd have your thinkin fits in the barn or somewheres
else next time I put this shirt on clean this mornin and now look at
it

His friend was too busy to pay any attention to this advice The pocket
search apparently being unsatisfactory he rose from the table and
hurriedly made a round of the room looking on the mantelpiece and under
chairs

I had it when I come in he soliloquized I know I did cause I was
wearin it when I went out to see to the hens I dont see where

If its your hat youre looking for observed Josiah I saw Mrs Snow
hang it up on the nail behind the door There it is now

The reply to this was merely a grunt which may or may not have
expressed approval At any rate the hat was apparently the object of
his search for he took it from the nail looked inside and with a sigh
of relief took out a crumpled envelope

I knew I put it somewheres he said Its a letter for you Elsie
Josiah here he brought it down from the postoffice when he come from
school this afternoon I meant to give it to you afore

Captain Eri who sat next to the young lady noticed that the envelope
was addressed in an irregular sprawling hand to Miss Elizabeth
Preston Orham Mass Elsie looked it over in the absent way in which
so many of us examine the outside of a letter which comes unexpectedly

I wonder who it is from she said

She did not open it at once but tucking it into her waist announced
that she must run upstairs in order that Mrs Snow might come down to
supper The housekeeper did come down a few minutes later and as she
was interested to know more about Luther Davis and his sister the talk
became animated and general

It was after eight oclock when Mrs Snow having finished washing the
dishesshe allowed no one to assist her in this operation since the
time when she caught Captain Jerry absentmindedly using the dust
rag instead of the dishclothwent upstairs to her patient Shortly
afterward Elsie came down wearing her hat and jacket

Im going out for a little while she said No I dont want anyone
to go with me Ill be back soon

Her back was turned to the three captains as she spoke but as she
opened the door the lamplight shone for an instant on her face and
Captain Eri noticed or fancied that he did that she was paler than
usual He rose and again offered to accompany her but met with such a
firm refusal that he could not insist further

Now thats kind of funny aint it remarked Perez I dont blieve
shes been out alone afore after dark sence shes been here

Where did you git that letter Josiah asked Captain Eri

It may as well be explained here that Captain Perez grandnephew was a
thorn in the flesh to everyone including his indulgent relative He was
a little afraid of Mrs Snow and obeyed her better than he did anyone
else but that is not saying a great deal He was in mischief in school
twothirds of the time and his reports made out by the teacher were
anything but complimentary He was a goodlooking boy the image of his
mother who had been her uncles favorite and he was popular with a
certain class of youngsters Also and this was worse his work at
the livery stable had thrown him in contact with a crowd of men like
Squealer Wixon Web Saunders and others of their class and they
appreciated his New York street training and made much of him Captain
Perez mindful of his promise to the boys mother did not use the
necessary measures to control him and Captain Eri and Captain Jerry did
not like to interfere

Just now he was seated in the corner and he looked up with a start
hurriedly folded up the tattered paper book he was reading stuffed it
into his pocket and said What

Who give you that letter that come for Elsie

Miss Cahoon up at the office It was in our box said the boy

Humph What are you readin thats so interestin

Oh nothin A book thats all

Let me look at it

Josiah hesitated looked as if he would like to refuse and then
sullenly took the ragged volume from his pocket and handed it to the
Captain who deliberately unfolded it and looked at the cover

Fightin Fred Starlight the Boy Rover of the Pacific he read
aloud Humph Is it good

Bet your life Its a redhot story

I want to know Who was Mr Moonshinewhats his nameStarlight

He was a sailor was the sulky answer Josiah was no fool and knew
when he was being made fun of

The Captain opened the book and read a page or two to himself Then he
said I see he knocked the skipper down cause he insulted him Nice
spunky chap Id like to have had him aboard a vessel of mine And he
called the old man a caitiff hound Awful thing to call a feller that
is Ill bet that skipper felt ashamed Looks like a good book Ill
borrow it tonight to read while youre doin your lessons

I aint got any lessons to do

Oh aint you I thought that was a rithmetic over there

Well I know em now Besides you aint got any right to order me
around You aint my uncle Cant I read that book Uncle Perez

Poor Perez He hesitated swallowed once or twice and answered You
can read it after youve studied a spell Youll let him have it then
wont you Eri Now study like a good boy

Captain Eri looked as if he would like to say something further but
he evidently thought better of it and tossed the paper novel across to
Captain Perez who put it on the table saying rather feebly

There now its right there where you can have it soons youve
larned your examples Now pitch in sos the teacher can see how smart
you are

His nephew grumblingly got his paper and pencil took the arithmetic
and went to work No one spoke for a while Captain Perez twirling his
thumbs and looking as he felt uncomfortable Soon Josiah announcing
that his studies were completed grabbed the novel from the table took
a lamp from the kitchen and went off to bed When he had gone Captain
Jerry said Perez youre spilin that boy

I spose I am I spose I am but I cant bear to be cross to him
somehow Poor Lizzie she made me promise I wouldnt be and I jest
cant thats all You understand how tis dont you Eri

The Captain nodded I understand he said Im sorry I said anything
I hadnt ought to be givin orders bout whats none of my affairs What
time is it gittin to be

Captain Jerry announced that it was bedtime and that he was going to
turn in Perez still looking worried and anxious said that he also was
going to bed Captain Eri thought that he would sit up for a while

Another hour and still another went by and the Captain sat there in his
rocker His two friends were sound asleep Mrs Snow called twice from
the head of the stairs to know if Elsie had come back and where on
earth she could be Captain Eris answers were cheery and to the effect
that the young lady had an errand up town and would be home pretty
soon he guessed Nevertheless it might have been noticed that he
glanced at the clock every few minutes and grew more and more fidgety

It was after eleven when Elsie came in She hurriedly and with some
confusion apologized for being so late and thanked the Captain for
sitting up for her She made no offer to explain her long absence
and as she went upstairs Captain Eri noticed that her face was if
anything paler than when she went out and her eyes looked as if
she had been crying He wanted to ask her some questions but didnt
because she evidently did not wish to talk He pondered over the matter
while undressing and for a long time after that lay awake thinking
That the girl was in trouble of some sort was plain but he could not
understand why she said nothing about it or what its cause might be
She had been her bright happy self all day and a part of the evening
Then she had suddenly changed The Captain wondered what was in that
letter



CHAPTER XII

A LITTLE POLITICS


Elsie when she came down to breakfast next morning was quieter than
usual and to the joking questions of Captain Jerry and Captain Perez
who were curious concerning her errand of the previous evening and
who pretended to believe that she had gone to a dance or time with
some feller unknown she gave evasive but goodhumored replies
Captain Eri was on his usual fishing trip and after breakfast was over
Perez departed to the Barry place and Jerry to his beloved schoolhouse
The sacrifice whose impending matrimonial doom had not been mentioned
for some time by the trio interested was gradually becoming his own
garrulous self and his principal topic of conversation recently had
been the coming marriage of the upstairs teacherthat is the lady
who presided over the grammar grade of the schooland the question of
her probable successor In fact this question of who the new teacher
was to be was the prevailing subject of surmise and conjecture in the
village just then

When Captain Jerry came back to the house he went out to the barn to
feed Lorenzo and the hens and attend to Daniels toilet He was busy
with the currycomb when Elsie came in She seated herself on a box and
watched the performance for a while without speaking The Captain who
took this part of his duties very seriously was too intent on crimping
Daniels rather scraggy forelock to talk much At length Miss Preston
broke the silence

Captain Jerry she said you have never told me just where you found
grandfather that night when he was taken sick On the hill back of the
postoffice wasnt it

Yes jest on the top You see hed fell down when he was runnin to
the fire

Captain Eri found him didnt he

Yep Whoa there Danl stand still cant you Yes Eri found him

How was he dressed

Who John Oh he was bareheaded and in his shirtsleeves jest as he
run outdoors when he heard the bell Queer he didnt put on that
old white hat of his I never knew him to be without it afore but a
fellers lible to forgit most anything a night like that was Did Eri
tell you how Perez forgot his shoes Funniest thing I ever see that
was

He began the story of his friends absentmindedness but his companion
did not seem to pay much attention to it In fact it was evident that
her thoughts were somewhere else for when the Captain asked her a
question that plainly called for a negative she replied Yes very
calmly and didnt seem to know that she had said it She went into
the house soon after and Captain Jerry after considering the matter
decided that she was probably thinking of Hazeltine He derived much
comfort from the idea

When he too entered the dining room Elsie said to him

Oh Captain Jerry Please dont tell the others that I asked about
grandfather They would think that I was worrying and Im not a bit
You wont mention it will you Just promise to please me

So the Captain promised although he did not understand why it was asked
of him

When Captain Eri came home that afternoon and was cleaning his catch at
the shanty he was surprised to receive a call from Miss Preston

Hello he exclaimed Come to larn the trade

Elsie smiled and disclaimed any intention of apprenticeship

Captain Eri she said I want to have a talk with you a business
talk

The Captain looked at her keenly All he said however was You dont
tell me

Yes I want to talk with you about getting me a position

A position

Yes Ive been thinking a great deal lately and now that grandfather
seems to be a little better and Im not needed to help take care of
him I want to do something to earn my living

Earn your livin Why child alive you dont need to do that You
aint a mite of trouble at the house fact is I dont know how wed get
along without you and as for money why I callate your grandpa aint
so poor but what if I let you have a little change once in a while
hed be able to pay me back when he got better

But I dont want to use your money or his either Captain Eri you
dont know what he has done for me ever since I was a little girl He
has clothed me and given me an education and been so kind and good
that now that he is ill and helpless I simply cant go on using his
money I cant and I wont

The tears stood in the girls eyes as she spoke and the Captain
noticing her emotion thought it better to treat the matter seriously
for the present at any rate

All right he said Independence shows a proper sperit and saves
grocery bills as old man Scudder said when his wife run off with the
tinpeddler What kind of a place was you thinkin of takin

I want to get the appointment to teach in the grammar school here Miss
Nixon is going to be married and when she leaves I want her placeand
I want you to help me get it

Captain Eri whistled I want to know he exclaimed Then he said
Look here Elsie I dont want you to think Im tryin to be curous
bout your affairs or anything like that but are you sure there aint
some reason more n youve told me of for your wantin this place I
aint no real relation of yours you understand but I would like to
have you feel that you could come to me with your troubles jest the
same as you would to your grandpa Now honest and true aint there
somethin back of this

It was only for a moment that Elsie hesitated but that moments
hesitation and the manner in which she answered went far toward
confirming the Captains suspicions

No Captain Eri she said It is just as Ive told you I dont want
to be dependent on grandfather any longer

And there aint a single other reason forOf course I ought to mind
my business butWell there what was it you wanted me to do Help you
git the place

Yes if you will I know Captain Perez has said that you were
interested in the townmeetings and helped to nominate some of the
selectmen and the schoolcommittee so I thought perhaps if you used
your influence you might get the position for me

Well I dont know I did do a little electioneerin for one or two
fellers and maybe theyd ought to be willin to do somethin for me
Still you cant never tell A cat ll jump over your hands if she knows
theres a piece of fish comin afterwards but when shes swallowed that
fish its a diffrent job altogether Same way with a politician But
then you let me think over it for a spell and praps tomorrow well
see You think it over too Maybe youll change your mind

No I shant change my mind Im ever and ever so much obliged to you
though

She started toward the door but turned impulsively and said Oh
Captain Eri you dont think that Im ungrateful do you You nor
Captain Perez nor Captain Jerry wont think that I do not appreciate
all your kindness You wont think that Im shirking my duty or that
I dont want to help take care of grandfather any longer You wont
Promise me you wont

She choked down a sob as she asked the question

Captain Eri was as much moved as she was He hastened to answer

No no no he exclaimed Course we wont do no such thing Run right
along and dont think another word about it Wait till tomorrer Ill
have a plan fixed up to land that schoolcommittee see if I dont

But all that evening he worked at the model of the clipper and the
expression on his face as he whittled showed that he was puzzled and
not a little troubled

He came back from his fishing next day a little earlier than usual
changed his workingclothes for his second best suit harnessed Daniel
into the buggy and then came into the house and announced that he was
going over to the Neck on an errand and if Elsie wanted to go with him
he should be glad of her company As this was but part of a prearranged
scheme the young lady declared that a ride was just what she needed

Captain Eri said but little as they drove up to the main road he
seemed to be thinking Elsie too was very quiet When they reached the
fruit and candy shop just around the corner the Captain stopped the
horse got down and went in When he came out he had a handful of
cigars

Why Captain Eri said Elsie I didnt know that you smoked cigars I
thought a pipe was your favorite

Well ginrally speakin tis was the answer but Im
electioneerin now and politics without cigars would be like a chowder
without any clams Rum goes with some kind of politics but terbacker
kind of chums in with all kinds Taint always safe to jedge a
candidate by the kind of cigars he gives out neither Ive found that
out

Reminds me of a funny thing that Obed Nickerson told me one time Obed
used to be in politics a good deal up and down the Cape here and he
had considerble influence Twas when Bradley up to Fall River was
runnin for Congress They had a kind of powwow in his officea whole
gang of district leadersand Obed he was one of em Bradley went to
git out the cigarbox and twas empty so he called in the boy that
swept out and run errands for him give the youngster a tendollar bill
and told him to go down to a terbacker store handy and buy another box
Well the boy he was a new one that Bradleyd jest hired seemed kind
of surprised to think of anybodys bein so reckless as to buy a whole
box of cigars at once but he went and pretty soon come back with the
box

The old man told him to open it and pass em round Well everybody
was lookin forard to a treat cause Bradley had the name of smokin
better stuff than the average but when they lit up and got agoin
Obed said you could see that the gang was sprised and some disgusted
The old man didnt take one at fust but everybody else puffed away and
the smoke and smell got thicker n thicker Obed said it reminded him
of a stable afire more n anything else Pretty soon Bradley bit the end
of one of the things and touched a match to it He puffed twiceObed
swears twant moren thatand then he yelled for the boy

For the Lords sake he says whered you git them cigars Well
it come out that the boy hadnt told who the cigars was for and hed
bought a box of the kind his brother that worked in the cotton mill
smoked Obed said youd ought to have seen Bradleys face when the
youngster handed him back seven dollars and seventyfive cents change

They reached that part of Orham which is called the Neck and pulled
up before a small building bearing the sign Solomon Bangs
AttorneyatLaw Real Estate and Insurance Here the Captain turned to
his companion and asked Sure you havent changed your mind Elsie You
want that schoolteachin job

I havent changed my mind Captain Eri

Well I wanted to be sure I should hate to ask Sol Bangs for anything
and then have to back out afterwards Come on now

Mr Soloman Bangs was the chairman of the Orham schoolcommittee He was
a short stout man with sandy sidewhiskers and a bald head He received
them with becoming condescension and asked if they wouldnt sit down

Why Ive got a little busness I want to talk with you bout
Sol said the Captain Elsie you set down here and make yourself
comftable and Sol and me ll go inside for a minute

As he led the way into the little private office at the back of the
building and seemed to take it for granted that Mr Bangs would follow
the latter gentleman couldnt well refuse The private office was
usually reserved for interviews with widows whose homestead mortgages
were to be foreclosed guileless individuals who had indorsed notes
for friends or others whose business was unpleasant and likely to
be accompanied with weeping or profanity Mr Bangs didnt object to
foreclosing a mortgage but he disliked to have a prospective customer
hear the dialogue that preceded the operation

On this occasion the door of the sanctum was left ajar so that Elsie
although she did not try to listen could not very well help hearing
what was said

She heard the Captain commenting on the late cranberry crop the
exceptionally pleasant weather of the past month and other irrelevant
subjects Then the perfumes of the campaign cigars floated out through
the doorway

Lets see said Captain Eri whens town meetin day

First Tuesday in December replied Mr Bangs

Why so tis so tis Gittin pretty nigh aint it What are you
goin to git off the schoolcommittee for

Me Get off the committee Who told you that

Why I dont know You are aint you Seems to me I heard Seth Wingate
was goin to run and hes from your district so I thought of course

Is Seth going to try for the committee

Seths a good man was the equivocal answer

A good man He aint any better man than I am Whats he know about
schools or how to run em

Well hes pretty popular Folks like him See here Sol whats this
bout your turnin Betsy Godfrey off her place

Who said I turned her off Ive been carrying that mortgage for so long
its grayheaded I cant be Santa Claus for the whole town Business is
business and Ive got to look out for myself

Yees I spose thats so Still folks talk and Seths got lots of
friends

Eri I aint denying that you could do a heap to hurt me if you wanted
to but I dont know why you should Ive always been square with you
fars I know What have you got against me

Oh nuthin nuthin Didnt I hear you was tryin to get that Harniss
teacher to come down here and take Carrie Nixons place when she got
married

Well I thought of her Shes all night isnt she

Yes I spose she is Twould be better if she lived in Orham maybe
and folks couldnt say you went out of town for a teacher when you could
have had one right from home Then shes some relation of your cousin
aint she Course thats all right butwell you cant pay attention
to everything thats said

Could have got one right from home Whod we get Dave Eldredges girl
I suppose I heard she was after it

The conversation that followed was in a lower tone and Elsie heard but
little of it She heard enough however to infer that Captain Eri was
still the disinterested friend and that Solomon was very anxious to
retain that friendship After a while the striking of matches indicated
that fresh cigars were being lighted and then the pair rose from their
chairs and entered the outer office Mr Bangs was very gracious
exceedingly so

Miss Preston he said Capn Hedge tells me that itermight be
possible for userfor the town to secureertoin short for us to
have you for our teacher in the upstairs room It aint necessary for me
to say thatera teacher from Radcliffe dont come our way very often
and that wethat is the town of Orham woulderfeel itself lucky if
youd be willing to come

Of course I told him Elsie said Captain Eri that you wouldnt
think of comin for fortyfive dollars a month or anything like that Of
course tisnt as though you really needed the place

I understand I understand said the pompous committeeman I think
that can be arranged I really thinkerMiss Preston that there aint
any reason why you cant consider it settled Ahem

Elsie thanked him trying her best not to smile and they were bowed
out by the great man who however called the Captain to one side
and whispered eagerly to him for a moment or two The word Seth was
mentioned at least once

Why Captain Eri exclaimed Elsie as they drove away

The Captain grinned Didnt know I was such a heeler did you he
said Well I tell you If youre fishin for eels there aint no use
usin a mackrel jig Sol hes a little mite eely and youve got to
use the kind of bait that ll fetch that sort of critter

But I shouldnt think he would care whether he was on the
schoolcommittee or not It isnt such an exalted position

Captain Eris answer was in the form of a parable Old Laban Simpkins
that lived round here one time he said was a mighty hard ticket
Drank rum by the hogshead pounded his wife till she left him and was
a tough nut ginrally Well one evenin Labe was comin home pretty
howcomeyouso and he fell into Jonadab Wixons well Wonder he want
killed but he want and they fished him out in a little while He
said that was the deepest well he ever saw said he begun to think it
reached clear through to the hereafter and when he struck the water he
was sprised to find it want hot He jined the church the next
week and somebody asked him if he thought religion would keep him from
fallin into any more wells He said no said he was lookin out for
somethin further on

Well thats the way tis with Sol Schoolcommittees all right but
this section of the Cape nominates a State representative next year

I mustnt forgit to see Seth he added I promised I would and
besides with a wink I think twould be better to do it cause
between you and me I dont blieve Seth knows that hes been thinkin
of runnin for the committee and has decided not to

The second member of the school board John Mullett was so the Captain
said a sort of me too to Mr Bangs and would vote as his friend
directed The third member was Mr Langworthy the Baptist minister
and although two to one was a clear majority Captain Eri asserted that
there was nothing like a unanimous vote and so they decided to call
upon the reverend gentleman

They found him at home and Elsie was surprised after the previous
interview to see how differently her champion handled the case There
was no preliminary parley and no beating about the bush Miss Prestons
claim to the soontobevacant position was stated clearly and with
vigor Also the reasons why she should receive a higher salary than had
previously been paid were set forth It was something of a surprise to
Elsie as it had been to Ralph to see how highly the townspeople that
is the respectable portion of them seemed to value the opinions of
this goodnatured but uneducated seaman And yet when she considered
that she too went to him for advice that she would not have asked of
other and far more learned acquaintances it did not seem so surprising
after all

The clergyman had had several candidates in mind but he was easily
won over to Elsies side partly by the Captains argument and partly
because he was favorably impressed by the young ladys appearance
and manner He expressed himself as being convinced that she would be
exactly the sort of teacher that the school required and pledged his
vote unconditionally

And so as Captain Eri said the stumpspeaking being over there was
nothing to do but to wait for the election and Elsie and he agreed
to keep the affair a secret until she received formal notice of the
appointment This was undoubtedly a good plan but unfortunately for
its success Solomon Bangs called upon his fellow in the committee Mr
Mullett to inform the latter that he entirely unaided had discovered
the very teacher that Orham needed in the person of John Baxters
granddaughter Mr Mullett living up to his me too reputation
indorsed the selection with enthusiasm and not only did that but
also told everyone he met so that Captain Perez heard of it at the
postoffice the very next afternoon

The natural surprise of this gentleman and of Captain Jerry at their
guests sudden determination was met by plausible explanations from
Captain Eri to the effect that Elsie was a smart girl and didnt
like to be hangin round doin nothin now that her grandpa was some
better Elsies own reason as expressed to them being just this the
pair accepted it without further questioning Neither of them attached
much importance to the letter which she had received although Captain
Perez did ask Mrs Snow if she knew from whom it came

The lady from Nantucket was not so easily satisfied At her first
opportunity she cornered Captain Eri and they discussed the whole
affair from beginning to end There was nothing unusual in this
proceeding for discussions concerning household matters and questions
of domestic policy were between these two getting to be more and more
frequent Mrs Snow was now accepted by all as one of the family and
Captain Eri had come to hold a high opinion of her and her views What
he liked about her he said was her good oldfashioned commonsense
and whereas he had formerly trusted to his own share of this virtue
almost altogether now he was glad to have hers to help out

The marriage idea that which had brought the housekeeper to Orham was
now seldom mentioned In fact Captain Eri had almost entirely ceased to
ruffle Jerrys feelings with reference to it Mrs Snow of course
said nothing about it But for that matter she said very little about
herself or her affairs

It was a curious fact that the lady from Nantucket had never referred
except in a casual way to her past history She had never told how she
came to answer the advertisement in the Nuptial Chime nor to explain
how so matteroffact a person as she was had ever seen that famous
sheet As she said nothing concerning these things no one felt at
liberty to inquire and in the course of time even Captain Perez
lively curiosity had lapsed into a trance

Mrs Snow was certain that Elsies reason for wishing to obtain the
position of schoolteacher was something more specific than the
one advanced She was also certain that the girl was troubled about
something The root of the matter she believed was contained in the
mysterious letter As Captain Eri was of precisely the same opinion
speculation between the two as to what that letter might have contained
was as lively as it was unfruitful

One thing was certain Elsie was not as she had formerly been She did
her best to appear the same but she was much more quiet and had fits
of absentmindedness that the Captain and the housekeeper noticed She
had no more evening errands but she occasionally took long walks in
the afternoons and on these walks she evidently preferred to be alone

Whether Mr Hazeltine noticed this change in her was a question The
Captain thought he did but at any rate his calls were none the less
frequent and he showed no marked objection when Captain Jerry who now
considered himself bound in honor to bring about the union he had so
actively championed brought to bear his artful schemes for leaving the
young folks alone These devices were so apparent that Elsie had more
than once betrayed some symptoms of annoyance all of which were lost on
the zealous matchmaker Ralph like the others was much surprised at
Miss Prestons application for employment but as it was manifestly
none of his business he of course said nothing

At the next committee meeting Elsie was unanimously chosen to fill Miss
Nixons shoes as trainer of the young idea at the grammar school and
as Miss Nixon was very anxious to be rid of her responsibilities in
order that she might become the carefree bride of a widower with two
small children the shoefilling took place in a fortnight

From her first days labors Elsie returned calm and unruffled She had
met the usual small rebellion against a new teacher and had conquered
it She said she believed she had a good class and she should get on
with them very nicely It should be mentioned in passing however that
Josiah Bartlett usually the ringleader in all sorts of trouble was a
trifle upset because the new schoolmistress lived in the same house
with him and so had not yet decided just how far it was safe to go in
trespassing against law and order

Thanksgiving day came and the Captains entertained Miss Patience Davis
and her brother and Ralph Hazeltine at dinner That dinner was an event
Captain Eri and Mrs Snow spent a full twenty minutes with the driver of
the butchers cart giving him directions concerning the exact breed
of turkey that was to be delivered and apparently these orders were
effectual for Captain Luther who was obliged to hurry back to the
lifesaving station as soon as dinner was over said that he was so full
of white meat and stuffing that he callated he should gobble all the
way to the beach His sister stayed until the next day and this was
very pleasing to all hands particularly Captain Perez

They had games in the evening and here the captains distinguished
themselves Seth Wingate and his wife and Mr and Mrs Obed Nickerson
came in as did several other retired mariners and their betterhalves
Obed brought his fiddle and sat in the corner and played the music for
a Virginia reel and Ralph laughed until he choked to see Captain
Jerryhalf of his shirtcollar torn loose from the button and flapping
like a sailconvoy stout Mrs Wingate from one end of the line to
the other throwing into the performance all the fancy cuts and
doubleshuffles he learned at the Thanksgiving balls of a good many
years before Captain Perez danced with Miss Patience who assured him
she had never had such a good time since she was born The only scoffer
was the bored Josiah who being a sophisticated New Yorker sat in the
best chair and gazed contemptuously upon the entire proceeding He told
Web Saunders the next day that he never saw such a gang of crazy
jays in his life

Even John Baxter was better that day He seemed a trifle more rational
and apparently understood when they told him that it was Thanksgiving
There would have been no cloud anywhere had not Mrs Snow entering her
room after Elsie had gone to bed found that young lady awake and crying
silently

And she wouldnt tell what the trouble was said the housekeeper to
Captain Eri the next day Said it was nothin she was kind of worried
bout her grandpa Now you and me know it want THAT I wish to
goodness we knew WHAT it was

The Captain scratched his nose with a perplexed air Theres one feller
Id like to have a talk with jest bout now he said thats the
one that invented that yarn bout a womans not bein able to keep a
secret



CHAPTER XIII

CAPTAIN JERRY MAKES A MESS OF IT


It was during the week that followed the holiday so gloriously
celebrated that Captain Jerry made a mess of it and all with the
best intentions in the world Elsie had had a hard day at the school
principally owing to the perversity of the irrepressible Josiah whose
love for deviltry was getting the better of his respect for the new
teacher The boy had discovered that Elsie never reported his bad
conduct to Captain Perez and therefore that the situation was not
greatly different from what it had been during the reign of Miss Nixon

On this particular day he had been a little worse than usual and
as uneasiness and mischief in a schoolroom are as catching as the
chickenpox Elsie came home tired and nervous Captain Eri and Mrs Snow
were certain that this increasing nervousness on the part of their guest
was not due to school troubles alone but at any rate nervous she was
and particularly nervous and it must be confessed somewhat inclined
to be irritable during the supper and afterward on this illstarred
night

The beginning of the trouble was when Ralph Hazeltine called Mrs Snow
was with her patient in the upper room Captain Eri was out and
Captain Perez and Captain Jerry were with Elsie in the dining room
The electrician was made welcome by the triomore especially by the
captains for Miss Preston was in no mood to be overeffusiveand a
few minutes of general conversation followed Then Captain Jerry in
accordance with his plan of campaign laid down his newspaper coughed
emphatically to attract the attention of his partner and said Well I
guess Ill go out and look at the weather for a spell Come on Perez

Why Captain Jerry exclaimed Elsie you were out looking at the
weather only ten minutes ago I dont think it has changed much since
then Why dont you stay here and keep us company

Oh you cant never tell about the weather long this coast Its
likely to change most any time Besides with a wink that expressed
comprehension unlimited I reckon you and Mr Hazeltine dont care much
bout the company of old fogies like me and Perez Twos company and
threes a crowd you know Ho ho ho

Captain Jerry come back this minute

But the Captain chuckled and shook out of the door followed by the
obedient Perez who having pledged fealty stuck to his colors whatever
might happen

At another time Elsie would probably have appreciated and enjoyed the
joke as much as anyone but this evening it did not appeal to her in
the least Ralph put in a very uncomfortable halfhour and then cut his
visit short and departed It was rather sharp and chilly outside
but the breeze felt like a breath from the tropics compared with the
atmosphere of that dining room

It certainly was Captain Jerrys unlucky evening for he left Perez
chatting with a fisherman friend who had left a favorite pipe in his
shanty and had come down to get it and entered the house alone He had
seen the electrician go and was surprised at the brevity of his call
but he was as far from suspecting that he himself was the indirect cause
of the said brevity as a mortal could be

He came into the dining room hung his cap on the back of a chair and
remarked cheerfully Well Elsie what did you send your company home
so quick for Land sake twelve oclock want none too late for me when
I was young and goin round to see the girls

But Miss Preston did not smile On the contrary she frowned and when
she spoke the Captain had a vague feeling that someone had dropped an
icicle inside his shirt collar

Captain Jerry said the young lady I want to have a talk with you
Why do you think it necessary to get up and leave the room whenever Mr
Hazeltine calls You do it every time and tonight was no exception
except that by what you said you made me appear a little more ridiculous
than usual Now why do you do it

The Captains jaw fell He stared at his questioner to see if she was
not joking but finding no encouragement of that kind stammered Why
do I do it Why

Yes why

Why cause I thought you wanted me to

_I_ wanted you to Why should you think that please

Well I dont know I thought you two would ruther be alone I know
when I used to go to see my wife fore we was married I

Please what has that got to do with Mr Hazeltines visits here

Why why nothin I spose if you say so I jest thought

What right have you to suppose that Mr Hazeltine is calling on me more
than any other person or persons in this house

This was something of a poser but the Captain did his best He sat on
the edge of a chair and rubbed his knee and then blurted out Well
I spose Ithat is we thought he was jest cause he natrally would
thats bout all If Id thoughtwhy see here Elsie dont YOU think
hes comin to see you

This was a return thrust that was hard to parry but although the
young ladys color heightened just a bit she answered without much
hesitation

I dont know that I do At any rate I have given you no authority to
act on any such assumption and I DONT want you to put me again in the
ridiculous position you did this evening and as you have done so often
before Why his visits might be perfect torture to me and still I
should have to endure them out of common politeness I couldnt go away
and leave him alone

Captain Jerrys face was a study of chagrin and troubled repentance

Elsie he said Im awful sorry I am so If Id thought I was
torturin of you stead of makin it pleasant Id never have done it
sure I wont go out again I wont honest I hope you wont lay it up
against me I meant well

Now if Captain Perez had delayed his entrance to that dining room
only two or three minutes longer if he had not come in just in time to
prevent Elsies making the explanatory and soothing answer that was on
her tongue events would probably have been entirely different and a
good deal of trouble might have been saved But in he came as if some
perverse imp had been waiting to give him the signal and the interview
between Captain Jerry and the young lady whom he had unwittingly
offended broke off then and there

Elsie went upstairs feeling a little consciencestricken and with an
uneasy idea that she had said more than she should have Captain Perez
took up the newspaper and sat down to read As for Captain Jerry he sat
down too but merely to get his thoughts assorted into an arrangement
less like a spilled box of jackstraws The Captains wonderful scheme
that he had boasted of and worked so hard for had fallen to earth like
an exploded airship and when it hit it hurt

His first idea was to follow the usual procedure and take the whole
matter to Captain Eri for settlement but the more he considered this
plan the less he liked it Captain Eri was an unmerciful tease and he
would be sure to rub it in in a way the mere thought of which made
his friend squirm There wasnt much use in confiding to Captain Perez
either He must keep the secret and pretend that everything was working
smoothly

Then his thoughts turned to Hazeltine and when he considered the wrong
he had done that young man he squirmed again There wasnt a doubt in
his mind that Ralph felt exactly as Elsie did about his interference
Captain Jerry decided that he owed the electrician an apology and
determined to offer it at the first opportunity

And the opportunity came the very next morning for Mrs Snow wanted
some clams for dinner and asked him to dig some for her The best clams
in the vicinity were those in the flat across the bay near the cable
station and the Captain took his bucket and hoe and rowed over there
As he was digging Ralph came strolling down to the shore

Mr Hazeltines Goodmorning was clear and hearty Captain Jerrys
was hesitating and formal The talk that followed was rather onesided
Finally the Captain laid down his hoe and came splashing over to where
his friend was standing

Mr Hazeltine he said confusedly I kind of feel as if I ought to
beg your pardon Im awful sorry I done what I did but as I said to
Elsie I meant well and Im sorry

Sorry Sorry for what

Why for leavin you and her alone so when you come to the house You
see I never thought but what youd both like it and twant till she
raked me over the coals so for doin it that I realized how things was

Raked you over the coals Im afraid I dont understand

It is unnecessary to repeat the whole of the long and tangled
conversation that ensued The Captain tried to explain tumbled down
metaphorically speaking got up again and started off on another tack
In his anxiety to make his position perfectly clear he quoted from
Elsies remarks of the previous evening and then thinking perhaps
he had gone too far tried to smooth these over by more explanations
Repeating this process several times got him into such a snarl that
he scarcely knew what he was saying When the agony was over Ralph had
received the impression that Miss Preston had said his visits were a
perfect torture to her that she objected to being left alone with him
that she held Captain Jerry responsible for these things and that the
latter was sorry for something or other though what it was he Ralph
didnt know or care particularly To the Captains continued apologies
he muttered absently that it was all right and walked slowly away
with his hands in his pockets Captain Jerry was relieved by this
expression of forgiveness He felt that the situation wasnt what he
would like to have it but at any rate he had done his duty This was
a great consolation

Ralph didnt call that evening or the next When he did drop in it was
merely to inquire concerning John Baxters progress and to chat for a
moment with the captains His next visit was a week later and was just
as brief and formal

If Elsie noticed this sudden change she said nothing There might have
been some comment by the others had not a new sensation so occupied
their minds as to shut out everything else This sensation was caused by
Josiah Bartlett who ran away one night with his belongings tied up in
a brown paper parcel leaving a note saying that he had gone to enlist
in the Navy and wasnt coming back any more

There were lively times the next morning when the note was found
Captain Perez was for harnessing up immediately and starting off to find
the lost one hit or miss Captain Eri soon showed him the folly of
this proceeding and instead hurried to the railway station and sent a
telegram describing the fugitive to the conductor of the Boston
train It caught the conductor at Sandwich and the local constable at
Buzzards Bay caught the boy Josiah was luxuriously puffing a fivecent
cigar in the smoking car and it was a crestfallen and humiliated
prodigal that accompanied by the a forementioned constable returned
to Orham that night

But the stubbornness remained and the next day Perez sought Captain Eri
in a troubled frame of mind

Eri he said dejectedly I dont know what Im goin to do with that
boy Hes too many for ME that boy is Seems hes been plannin this
runnin away busness for more n a month been doin errands and odd
jobs round town and savin up his money on purpose Says he wont go
back to school again no matter what we do to him and that hes goin
to git into the Navy if it takes ten year He says hell run away again
fust chance he gits and he WILL too Hes got the sperit of the Old
Scratch in him and I cant git it out Im clean discouraged and wore
out and I know that hell do somethin pretty soon that ll disgrace us
all

Humph exclaimed his friend Stuffy as all that is he You dont
say He aint a bad boy that is a REEL bad boy either

No thats jest it He aint reel badyit But he will be if he aint
fetched up pretty sudden Course I know what he needs is to be made
to mind fust and then preached to afterwards And I know that natrally
Im the one that ought to do it but I jest cantthere If I should
start out to give him the dressin down he needs Id be thinkin of his
mother every minute and how I promised to treat him gentle and not be
cross to him But SOMETHINS got to be done and if you can help me out
any way Ill never forgit it Eri

Captain Eri scratched his chin Humph he grunted reflectively He
couldnt git into the Navy hes too young More likely to be a stowaway
on a merchantman and then roustabout on a cattle boat or some such
thing Even if he lied bout his age and did git to be a sort of
a ships boy on a sailin vessel you and me know what that means
nowadays I presume likely twould end in his bein killed in some
rumshop scrimmage later on Letmesee Bound to be a sailor is he

Hes dead sot on it

More fool he Comes from readin them ridiclous story books I spose
He aint been on the water much sence hes been down here has he

Not more n once or twice except in a dory goin to the beach or
somethin like that

Thats so thats what I thought Well Perez Ill tell you The boy
does need breakin in thats a fact and I think maybe I could do it I
could use a young feller on my boat to go coddin with me I mean
Let me have the boy under meno meddlin from anybodyfor a couple
of months Let him sign reglar articles and ship long of me for that
time Maybe I could make a white man of him

I dont blieve hed do it

I callate I could talk him into it Theres some butter on my tongue
when its necessary

Youd have to promise not to lay a hand on him in anger Thats what I
promised his mother

All right I promise it now Thats all right Perez You and me are
old shipmates and bound to help each other out Just trust him to me
and dont ask too many questions Is it a trade Good Shake

They shook hands on it and then Captain Eri went in to talk to the
unreconciled runaway That young gentleman fresh from his triumph over
his uncle at first refused to have anything to do with the scheme He
wasnt going to be a cheap guy fisherman he was going into the
Navy The Captain did not attempt to urge him neither did he preach or
patronize He simply leaned back in the rocker and began spinning sailor
yarns He told of all sorts of adventures in all climates and with all
sorts of people He had seen everything under the sun apparently and
according to him there was no life so free and void of all restraint
as that of an able seaman on a merchant ship or preferably on a
fisherman but one point he made clear and that was that unless the
applicant had had previous training his lot was likely to be an unhappy
one

Of course he said as he rose to go it was my idea to sort of train
you up sos you could be ready when twas time to ship but longs you
dont want to why its all off

Ill go with you Cap said Josiah whose eyes were shining

Good Thats the talk You might as well sign articles right away Wait
till I git em ready

He brought pen ink and paper and proceeded to indite a formidable
document to the effect that Josiah Bartlett able seaman was to ship
aboard the catboat Mary Ellen for a term of two months Wages five
dollars a month

You see he said Ive put you down as able seaman cause thats what
youll be when I git through with you Now sign

So Josiah signed and then Captain Eri affixed his own signature with a
flourish

There exclaimed the Captain bringing his big palm down on the back
of the able seaman with a thump that brought water into the eyes of
that proud youth Youre my man shipmate We sail tomorrer mornin at
four rain or shine Ill call you at quarter of Be ready

You bet old man said Josiah

Captain Perez met his friend as they came out of the parlor

Now Eri he whispered be easy as you can with him wont you

The Captain answered in the very words of his crew

You bet he said fervently and went away whistling Captain Perez
slept better that night



CHAPTER XIV

THE VOYAGE OF AN ABLE SEAMAN


Promptly at a quarter to four the next morning Captain Eri rapped on the
parlor door Josiah who had been dressed since three appeared almost
instantly They walked down to the shore together and the Captains
eyes twinkled as he noted the elaborate roll in the boys walk

The Mary Ellen was anchored between the beaches and they rowed off to
her in a dory It was pitchdark and cold and raw Lanterns showed on
two or three of the other boats near by and as Josiah and the Captain
pulled up the eelgrasscovered anchor a dim shape glided past in the
blackness It was the You and I bound out Ira Sparrow was at the helm
and he hailed the Mary Ellen saying something about the weather

It ll be kind of cam for a spell replied Captain Eri but I
wouldnt wonder if we had some wind fore night Here you fomast
hand he added turning to Josiah stand by to git the canvas on her

The mainsail was soon hoisted and the catboat moved slowly out of the
bay

Gee its dark exclaimed Josiah what are you goin way off here
for Why dont you go straight out

I ginrally take the short cut through the narrers replied the
Captain but I thought you mightnt like the breakers on the shoals so
Im goin round the pint flat

Huh I aint ascared of breakers Cant be too rough for me Wisht
twould blow to beat the band

Maybe twill by and by Pretty tolerble slick now though

It was after sunrise when they reached the ledge where codfish most do
congregate The land was a mere yellow streak on the horizon The stiff
easterly blow of the day before had left a smooth heavy swell that
tripping over the submerged ledge alternately tossed the Mary Ellen
high in air and dropped her toward the bottom It was cold and the
newly risen December sun did not seem to have much warmth in it Anchor
over the side the Captain proposed breakfast

The able seaman did not feel very hungry but he managed to swallow
a hardboiled egg and a sandwich and then just to show that he had
reached the dignity of manhood leaned back against the side of the
cockpit lit a cigarette and observed cheerfully This is hot stuff
aint it Cap

Captain Eri wiped the crumbs from his mouth leisurely produced his
pipe and proceeded to fill it with tobacco shaved from a chunky plug

What dyou smoke them things for he asked contemptuously referring
to the cigarette Nobody but dudes and sissies smoke that kind of
truck Here take this pipe and smoke like a man

Josiah looked askance at the proffered pipe

Oh no he said magnanimously youll want it yourself Ill get
along with these things till I git ashore then Ill buy a pipe of my
own

Never you mind bout me Ive got two or three more below there
someeres Take it and light up

The able seaman took the reeking nicotine soaked affair placed it
gingerly between his teeth held a match to the bowl and coughingly
emitted a cloud of illsmelling smoke The pipe wheezed and gurgled and
the Mary Ellen rocked and rolled

Now then said Captain Eri weve sojered long enough Go below and
bring up the bait bucket and the lines

Josiah staggered into the little cabin reappeared with the heavy cod
lines and the bucket of mussels and watched while the Captain baited
up

All ready said the skipper Two lines apiece one over each side
Watch me

The cod bit almost immediately and for ten minutes the work was
exciting and lively The Captain watching from the corner of his eye
noticed that his assistants pipe was wheezing less regularly and that
his lines were thrown over more and more listlessly At length he said
Havent stopped smokin so quick have you Whats the mattergone
out Heres a match

I guessed Ive smoked enough for now I cant fish so well when Im
smokin

Bosh If you want to be a reel sailor you must smoke all the time
Light up

Reluctantly the boy obeyed and puffed with feverish energy Also he
swallowed with vigor The cod smelt fishy so did the bait and the
catboat rolled and rolled Suddenly Josiah pulled in his lines and took
the pipe from his lips

Whats the matter inquired the watchful skipper

II guess I wont fish any more Cap Kind of slow sport aint it
Guess Ill go in there and take a snooze

I guess you wont You shipped to fish and youre goin to fish Pick
up them lines

The boy sullenly turned toward the cabin door Was he who had just
declared himself independent of school restraint he who had once
been the thorn in the flesh of every policeman in the th ward to be
ordered about by this Cape Cod countryman Aw go chase yourself he
said contemptuously A minute after when he picked himself up from
the heap of slimy fish in the bottom of the boat he saw the Captain
standing solidly on one cowhideshod foot while the other was drawn
easily back and rested on its toe When Josiah recovered his breath the
burst of bad language with which he assailed his companion did credit to
his street bringing up It was as short as it was fierce however and
ended amid the cod and the mussels from the overturned bait bucket
But as the Captain said afterwards he was spunky and rose again
incoherent with rage

YouyouIll kill you he shrieked You promised not to touch me
you lyin old

He tried to get out of the way but didnt succeed and this time merely
sat up and sobbed as Captain Eri said in even tones

No Im not lyin I promised not to lay a hand on you in anger thats
all Fust place I dont kick with my hands and second place I aint
angry Now then pick up them lines

The able seaman was frightened This sort of treatment was new to
him He judged it best to obey now and get square later on He sulkily
picked up the codlines and threw the hooks overboard Captain Eri
calmly resuming his fishing went on to say The fust thing a sailor
has to larn is to obey orders I see youve stopped smokin Light up

I dont want to

Well I want you TO Light up

I wont Oh yes I will

He eyed the threatening boot fearfully and lit the awful pipe with
shaking fingers But he had taken but a few puffs when it went over the
side and it seemed to Josiah that the larger half of himself went with
it The Captain watched the paroxysm grimly

Sick hey he grunted and not a capful of wind stirrin Youre
a healthy sailor I thought Id shipped a man but I see twas only a
sassy baby My uncle Labe had a good cure for seasickness You take a
big hunk of fat salt pork dip it in molasses and

Oh dont Another spasm

Dip it in molasses repeated Captain Eri

Dont Cap PLEASE dont

Another thing a sailor learns is not to call his skipper Cap A
fomast hand always says Aye aye sir when his offcer speaks to
him Understand that

Yes Oh Lord

WHAT

YeI mean aye aye

Aye aye WHAT

Aye aye SIR OH dear me

Thats better Now pick up them lines

Well twas a dreadful forenoon for Josiah one not to be forgotten The
boat rolled unceasingly his head ached and pulling the heavy cod made
his back and shoulders lame also he was wet and cold The other boats
scattered about the fishing grounds pulled up their anchors and started
for home but Captain Eri did not budge At noon he opened his lunch
basket again and munched serenely The sight of the greasy ham
sandwiches was too much for the able seaman He suffered a relapse
and when it was over tumbled on the seat which encircled the cockpit
and being completely worn out went fast asleep The Captain watched
him for a minute or two smiled in a not unkindly way and going into
the cabin brought out an old pea jacket and some other wraps with which
he covered the sleeper Then he went back to his fishing

When Josiah awoke the Mary Ellen was heeled over on her side her sail
as tight as a drumhead The wind was whistling through the cordage and
the boat was racing through seas that were steelblue and angry with
whitecaps on their crests The sun was hidden by tumbling dustcolored
clouds The boy felt weak and strangely humble the dreadful nausea was
gone

Captain Eri standing at the tiller regarded him sternly but there was
the suspicion of a twinkle in his eye

Feelin better he asked

Yeaye aye sir

Humph Want to smoke again Pipe right there on the thwart

No thank you sir

It was some time before anything more was said Josiah was gazing at
the yellow sandcliffs that on every tack grew nearer At length the
Captain again addressed him

Perez ever tell you bout our fust vyage Never did hey Well I
will Him and me run away to sea together you know

And then Captain Eri began a tale that caused the cold shivers to chase
themselves from Josiahs big toe to the longest hair on his head It
was the story of two boys who ran away and shipped aboard an Australian
sailing packet and contained more firstclass horrors than any one of
his beloved dime novels As a finishing touch the narrator turned back
the grizzled hair on his forehead and showed a threeinch scar souvenir
of a first mate and a belaying pin He rolled up his flannel shirtsleeve
and displayed a slightly misshapen left arm broken by a kick from a
drunken captain and badly set by the same individual

Now he said in conclusion I callate you think I was pretty hard
on you this mornin but what do you figger that youd have got if you
talked to a mate the way you done to me

Dont know Spose Id have been killedsir

Well you would mighty nigh and thats a fact Now Ill tell you
somethin else You wanted to enlist in the Navy I understand You
couldnt git in the Navy anyway youre too young but spose you
could what then Youd never git any higher n a petty officer cause
you dont know enough The only way to git into the Navy is to go
through Annapolis and git an education I tell you education counts
Me and Perez would have been somethin more n cheap fishin and
coastin skippers if wed had an education dont forgit that

I guess I dont want to be a sailor anyway sir This one trip is
enough for me thank you

Cant help that You shipped long with me for two months and youll
sail with me for two months every time I go out You wont run away
again neither Ill look out for that Youll sail with me and youll
help clean fish and youll mind me and youll say sir You neednt
smoke if you dont want to with a smile I aint pticlar bout
that

Then went on the Captain when the two months is up youll be your
own master again You can go back to Web Saunders and Squealer Wixon
and Ily Tucker and their tribe if you want to and be a town nuisance
and a goodfornuthin OR you can do this You can go to school for a
few years more and behave yourself and then if Ive got any influence
with the Congressman from this districtand I sort of blieve I have
secondhanded at any rateyou can go to Annapolis and learn to be a
Navy officer Thats my offer Youve got a couple of months to think it
over in

The catboat swung about on her final tack and stood in for the narrows
the route which the Captain had spoken of as the short cut From
where Josiah sat the way seemed choked with lines of roaring frothing
breakers that nothing could approach and keep above water But Captain
Eri steered the Mary Ellen through them as easily as a New York
cabdriver guides his vehicle through a jam on Broadway picking out the
smooth places and avoiding the rough ones until the last bar was crossed
and the boat entered the sheltered waters of the bay

By gum exclaimed the enthusiastic able seaman That was
greatersir

Thats part of what Ill larn you in the next two months said the
Captain Twont do you any harm to know it when youre in the Navy
neither Stand by to let go anchor



CHAPTER XV

IN JOHN BAXTERS ROOM


If Josiah expected any relaxation in Captain Eris stern discipline he
was disappointed for he was held to the strict letter of the shipping
articles The Captain even went to the length of transferring Perez
to the parlor cot and of compelling the boy to share his own room This
was of course a precaution against further attempts at running away
Morning after morning the pair rose before daylight and started for the
fishing grounds There were two or three outbreaks on the part of the
able seaman but they ended in but one way complete submission After
a while Josiah being by no means dull came to realize that when he
behaved like a man he was treated like one He learned to steer the Mary
Ellen and to handle her in all weathers Also his respect for Captain
Eri developed into a liking

Captain Perez was gratified and delighted at the change in his
grandnephews behavior and manners and was not a little curious to
learn the methods by which the result had been brought about His hints
being fruitless he finally asked his friend pointblank Captain Eris
answer was something like this

Perez he said do you remember old man Sanborn that kept school
here when you and me was boys Well when the old man run foul of a
youngster that was sassy and uppish he knocked the sass out of him fust
and then talked to him like a Dutch uncle He used to call that kind of
treatment moral suasion Thats what Im doin to Josiah Im moral
suasionin him

Captain Perez was a little anxious concerning the first part of this
course of training but its results were so satisfactory that he
asked no more questions The fact is Captain Perez mind was too much
occupied with another subject just at this time to allow him to be
overanxious The other subject was Miss Patience Davis

Miss Davis her visit with her brother being over was acting as
companion to an old lady who lived in a little house up the shore a
mile or so above the station This elderly female whose name was Mayo
had a son who kept a grocery store in the village and was therefore
obliged to be away all day and until late in the evening Miss Patience
found Mrs Mayos crotchets a bit trying but the work was easy and
to her liking and she was as she said right across the way as you
might say from Luther The way referred to was the stretch of water
between the outer beach and the mainland

And Captain Perez was much interested in Miss patiencevery much so
indeed His frequent visits to the Mayo homestead furnished no end of
amusement to Captain Eri and also to Captain Jerry who found poking
fun at his friend an agreeable change from the old programme of being
the butt himself He wasnt entirely free from this persecution
however for Eri more than once asked him in tones the sarcasm of which
was elaborately veiled if his matchmaking scheme had gotten tired and
was sitting down to rest To which the sacrifice would reply stoutly
Oh its comin out all right you wait and see

But in his heart Captain Jerry knew better He had been wise enough
to say nothing to his friends concerning his interviews with Elsie
and Ralph but apparently the breakingoff between the pair was final
Hazeltine called occasionally it is true but his stays were short
and at the slightest inclination shown by the older people to leave the
room he left the house There was some comment by Eri and Mrs Snow on
this sudden change but they were far from suspecting the real reason
Elsie continued to be as reticent as she had been of late her school
work was easier now that Josiah was no longer a pupil

Christmas was rather a failure There were presents of course but
the planned festivities were omitted owing to a change in John Baxters
condition From growing gradually better he now grew slowly but
surely worse Dr Palmers calls were more frequent and he did not
conceal from Mrs Snow or the captains his anxiety They hid much of
this from Elsie but she too noticed the change and was evidently
worried by it Strange to say as his strength ebbed the patients mind
grew clearer His speech that in his intervals of consciousness had
heretofore dealt with events of the past was now more concerned with
recent happenings But Captain Eri had never heard him mention the fire

One afternoon in January Mrs Snow and Captain Eri were together in
the sick room The rest of the household was absent on various errands
Captain Perez paying a visit to the lifesavers sister and Elsie
staying after school to go over some examination papers There was snow
on the ground and a Jinooary thaw was causing the eaves to drip and
the puddles in the road to grow larger The door of the big stove was
open and the coals within showed redhot Captain Baxter was apparently
asleep

Let me see said Mrs Snow musingly in a low tone Ive been here
now two three over four months Seems longer somehow

Seems almost as if youd always been here replied Captain Eri Queer
how soon we git used to a change I dont know how we got along afore
but we did some way or other if you call it gittin along he added
with a shrug I should hate to have to try it over again

Its always seemed funny to me remarked the lady that you men all
sailors soand used to doin for yourselves should have had such a
time when you come to try keepin house I should have expected it if
you waswell doctors or somethin like thatused to havin folks
wait on you but all sea captains it seems queer

It does dont it Ive thought of that myself Anybodyd think we was
the most shifless lot that ever lived but we want Even Jerryand
hes the wust one of the three when it comes to leavin things at loose
endsalways had a mighty neat vessel and had the name of makin his
crews toe the mark I honestly blieve it come of us bein on shore and
runnin the shebang on a share and share alike idee If thered been a
skipper a feller to boss things wed have done better but when all
hands was bossnobody felt like doin anything Then too we begun too
old A feller gits sort of sot in his ways and its hard to give in to
the other chap

Now take that marryin idee he went on I laughed at that a good
deal at fust and didnt really take any stock in it but I guess twas
real hoss sense after all Anyhow it brought you down here and what
wed done without you when John was took sick _I_ dont know I havent
said much about it but Ive felt enough and I know the other fellers
feel the same way Youve been so mighty good and put up with so many
things that must have fretted you like the nation and the way youve
managedmy

The wholesouled admiration in the Captains voice made the housekeeper
blush like a girl

Dont say a word Capn Eri she protested Its been jest a pleasure
to me honest Ive had more comfort andwell peace you might say
sence Ive been in this house than Ive had afore for years

When I think said the Captain of what we might have got for that
advertisement I swan it makes my hair curl Advertisin that way in
that kind of a paper why we might have had aa play actress or I
dont know what landed on us Seems s if there was a Providence in it
seems s if you was kind of SENTthere

I dont know what you must think of me answerin an advertisement for
a husband that way It makes me shamed of myself when I think of it I
declare And in that kind of a paper too

Ive wondered more times than a few how you ever got a hold of that
paper Taint one youd see every day natrally you know

Mrs Snow paused before she answered Then she said slowly Well Im
sprised you aint asked that afore I havent said much about myself
sence Ive been here for no pticlar reason that I know of except
that there wasnt much to tell and it wasnt a very interestin yarn to
other folks My husbands name was Jubal Snow

You dont say exclaimed the Captain Why Jerry used to know him

I shouldnt wonder Jubal knew a lot of folks on the Cape here He
was a good husbandno better anywheresand he and I had a good life
together long as he was well Ive sailed a good many vyages with him
and I feel pretty nigh as much at home on the water as I do on land
Our trouble was the same that a good many folks have we didnt callate
that fair weather wouldnt last all the time thats all

It wasnt his fault any more than twas mine We saved a little money
but not enough as it turned out Well he was took down sick and had to
give up goin to sea and we had a little place over in Nantucket and
settled down on it Fust along Jubal was able to do a little farmin
and so on and we got along pretty well but by and by he got so he
want able to work and then twas harder What little wed saved went
for doctors bills and this that and tother He didnt like to have
me leave him so I couldnt earn much of anything and finlly we come
to where somethin had to be done right away and we talked the thing
over and decided to mortgage the house The money we got on the mortgage
lasted until he died

He had a little life insurance not enough of course but a little He
was plannin to take on more but somehow it never seemed as if he could
die he so big and strong and we put it off until he got so he couldnt
pass the examination When the insurance money come I took it to Jedge
Briar a mighty good friend of Jubals and mine and the one that held
the mortgage on the house and I told him I wanted to pay off the
mortgage with it sos Id have the house free and clear But the Jedge
advised me not to said the mortgage was costin me only six per
cent and why didnt I put the money where twas likely to be a good
investment that would pay me eight or ten per cent Then Id be makin
money he said I asked him to invest it for me and he put it into the
Bay Shore Land Company where most of his own was

Sho I want to know broke in the Captain He did hey Well I had
some there too and so did Perez Precious few famlies on the Cape
that didnt

Yes he thought twas the safest and best place he knew of The
officers bein sons of Cape people and their fathers such fine men
everybody said twas all right I got my dividends reglar for a while
and I went out nussin and did sewin and got along reel well I kept
thinkin some day Id be able to pay off the mortgage and I put away
what little I could towards it but then _I_ was took sick and that
money went and then the Land Company went up the spout

The Captain nodded The failure of the company had brought poverty to
hundreds of widows Mrs Snows case was but another instance

Let me see said the lady Where was I Oh yes the Land Companys
failin Well it failed and the insurance money went with it It was
discouragin of course but I had my house except for the mortgage
and I had my health again and if I do say it I aint afraid of work
so I jest made up my mind there was no use cryin over spilt milk and
that I must git along and begin to save all over again Then Jedge Briar
died and his nephew up to Boston come into the property I was behind
in my payments a little and they sent me word they should foreclose the
mortgage and they did

Well I swan The mean sculpins Didnt you have NOBODY you could go
to no relations nor nothin

Ive got a brother out in Chicago but he married rich and his wife
doesnt care much for her husbands relations I never saw her but once
and then one of the first things she asked me was if it was true that
there was more crazy people in Nantucket than in any other place of
its size on earth and afore I could answer she asked me what made em
crazy I told her I didnt know unless it was answerin city folks
questions She didnt like that very well and I havent heard from
Jobthats my brotherfor a long time All my other near relations are
dead

So they foreclosed the mortgage and gave me notice to move out I
packed my things and watered my flowersI had quite a pretty flower
gardenfor the last time and then come in and set down in the rocker
to wait for the wagon that was goin to move me I got to thinkin how
proud Jubal and me was when we bought that house and how we planned
about fixin it up and how our baby that died was born in it and
how Jubal himself had died there and told me that he was glad he was
leavin me a home at any rate and I got so lonesome and discouraged
that I jest cried I couldnt help it But Ive never found that cryin
did much good so I wiped my eyes and looked for somethin to read to
take up my mind And that Chime paper was what I took up

You see thered been a big excursion from Boston down the day before
and some of the folks come down my way to have a sort of picnic Two
of em factory girls from Brockton they was come to the house for a
drink of water They were gigglin foolish enough critters but I asked
em in and they eat their lunches on my table They left two or three
story papers and that Chime thing when they went away

Well I looked it over and almost the first thing I saw was that
advertisement signed Skipper It didnt read like the other trashy
things in there and it sounded honest And all of a sudden it come over
me that Id answer it I was lonesome and tired and sort of didnt care
and I answered it right off without waitin another minute Thats all
there is to tell When I come here to be housekeeper I wrote the folks
thats takin care of my furnituretheyre reel kind people I was
goin to board there if I had stayed in Nantucketto keep it till I
come back There I meant to tell you this long ago and I dont know
why I havent

The Captain knew why she hadnt It was easy to read between the lines
the tale of the years of disappointment and anxiety Such stories are
not easy to tell and he respected the widow more than ever for the
simple way in which she had told hers

That Land Company busness he said carried off a good lot of Cape
Cod money I never saw but one man that I thought was glad it busted
and that was old Caleb Weeks over to Harniss The old man was rich
but closer n the bark of a treehed skin a flea for the hide and
tallerand used to be a hard case into the bargain One time they had
a big revival over there and he got religion The boys used to say what
caught Caleb was the ministers sayin salvation was free Well anyhow
he got converted and jined the church That was all right only while
the fit was fresh he pledged himself to give five hundred dollars to
help build the new chapel When he cooled down a little he was sorry
and every time theyd hint at his comin down with the cash hed back
and fill and put it off for a spell When the Land Company went up he
was the only happy one in town cause he said hed lost all his money
Course under the circumstances they couldnt ask him to pay so he
didnt From what I hear he lost as much as fifty dollars

They both laughed and Mrs Snow was about to answer when she was
interrupted

Eri said a weak voice Eri

The Captain started turned sharply and saw the sick man watching him
his eyes fixed and unwavering

Eri said John Baxter again come here

Mrs Snow hurried to her patient but the latter impatiently bade her
let him alone

Not you he said I want Eri

Captain Eri stooped down beside the bed

What is it John he asked

Eri spose God called you to break mans law and keep his what would
you do

The Captain glanced anxiously at the housekeeper Then he said
soothingly

Oh thats all right John Dont worry bout that You and me settled
that long ago How are you feelin now

I know I know with the monotonous persistence of those whose minds
are wanderingand then cleanly once more Eri Ive been called

Sshh Thats all right John thats all right Dont you want Mrs
Snow to fix your piller Praps youd lay a little easier then Now
Mrs Snow if youll jest turn it while I lift him So thats
better now aint it shipmate hey But the sick man muttered an
unintelligible something and relapsed once more into the halfdoze
halfstupor that was his usual state

Captain Eri sighed in relief

That was queer want it he observed

Hes had two or three of those spells in the last day or two was the
answer

The Captain wondered what his friend might have said during those
spells but he was afraid to inquire Instead he asked What did the
doctor say when he was here this mornin

Nothin very hopeful I asked him plain what he thought of the case
and he answered jest as plain He said Capn Baxter had failed dreadful
in the last week and that he wouldnt be sprised if he dropped off
most any time Then again he said he might live for months

I see I see

They were silent for a while watching the sick man whose sleep
or stupor was not as tranquil as usual Two or three times his eyes
opened and he muttered audibly

I never saw him so restless afore commented Captain Eri anxiously

He was so last night

Did Elsie see him

No I was alone here and she was asleep in the next room I got up and
shut the door

The Captain glanced keenly at the housekeeper but her face was placid
and inscrutable He shifted uneasily and then said Elsies late
tonight aint she I wonder whats keepin her

School work I spose Shes workin harder n she ought to I think

FIRE

The word was shouted and the room rang with it John Baxter whose
weakness had hitherto been so great that he could not turn himself in
bed was leaning on his elbow and pointing with outstretched finger to
the open stove door

Fire he shouted again Its blazin Its burnin Its wipin the
plague spot from the earth I hear you Lord Im old but I hear you
and your servants ready Where will it be tomorrer Gone burnt up
and the ways of the wicked shant prevail

They forced him back on the pillow but he fought them fiercely for a
moment or two After they thought they had quieted him he broke out
again talking rapidly and clearly

I hear the call Lord he said I thank thee for showin it to me in
your Book And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt and all
their goodly castles with fire With fire With fire

Sshh There there John Dont talk so entreated the Captain

Wheres the kerosene continued the old man And the matches Now
softly softly The shavins Its dark Here in the corner Ah ha
ah ha And all their goodly castles with fire Now Web Saunders you
wicked man Now Burn Ive done it Lord Ive done it

Hush almost shouted the agonized Captain Eri Hush John Be still

There there Capn Baxter said Mrs Snow soothingly laying her hand
on the sick mans forehead Somehow the touch seemed to quiet him his
eyes lost their fire and he muttered absently that he was tired Then
the eyes closed and he lay still breathing heavily

Land of love exclaimed the Captain That was awful Hadnt I better
go for the doctor

I dont think so unless he gits worse He had jest such a turn as I
told you last night

Did he talk like he did jest now

Jest the same

Bout the same things

Yes

The Captain gasped Then you knew he said

That he set the billiard room afire Yes Ive always rather
suspicioned that he did and last night of course made me sure of it

Well well You havent said nothin bout it to anybody

Of course not

No course you havent You must excuse meIm kind of upset I
guess Dear dear Did you think _I_ knew it

I sort of guessed that you did

Well I did Ive known it ever sence that night he was found He had
his coat on when I found him and twas all burnt and there was an
empty kerosene bottle in his pocket I hid the coat and threw the
bottle away and turned him so he was facin towards the saloon stead
of from it And I lied when I told the doctor that he was jest as he
fell There the murders out Now what do you think of me

Think I think you did exactly right

You DO

I sartinly do

Well I snum Ive been over that thing time and time again and Ive
felt like I was sort of a firebug myself sometimes Ive heard folks
layin it to fust one and then the other and callatin that Web did it
himself to git the insurance and all the time Ive known who really
did do it and havent said anything I jest couldnt You see John and
mes been brothers almost But I didnt spose anybody else would see it
the same way

Capn Eri do you spose I blame you for tryin to keep your best
friend out of trouble that he got into by beinwellout of his head
Why land of mercy He aint no more to be held responsible than a baby
You did what Id have done if Id been in your place and I respect you
for it

The Captains voice shook as he answered

Marthy Snow he said youre the kind of woman that Id like to have
had for a sister

It was perhaps a halfhour later when Captain Eri started for the
schoolhouse to bring Elsie home John Baxter had not wakened and Mrs
Snow said she was not afraid to remain alone with him The thaw had
turned to a light rain and the Captain carried an umbrella It was dark
by this time and when he came in sight of the schoolhouse he saw a
light in the window

One of the scholarsa by no means brilliant onewhose principal
educational achievement was the frequency with which he succeeded in
being kept after school was seated on the fence doing his best to
whittle it to pieces with a new jackknife

Hello sonny said the Captain Miss Preston gone yit

No she aint replied the boy continuing to whittle Shes up
there Mr Saunders is there too

Saunders WEB SAUNDERS

Yup I see him go in there a little while ago Captain Eri started
toward the schoolhouse at a rapid pace then he suddenly stopped and
then as suddenly walked on again All at once he dropped his umbrella
and struck one hand into the palm of the other with a smack

When he reached the door he leaned the umbrella in the corner and
walked up the stairs very softly indeed



CHAPTER XVI

A BUSINESS CALL


That enterprising business man Mr Web Saunders opened the door of
his renovated billiard room a little later than usual the next morning
It was common report about the village that Mr Saunders occasionally
sampled the contents of some of the original packages which bearing
the name and address of a Boston wholesale liquor dealer came to him
by express at irregular intervals It was also reported probably by
unreliable total abstainers that during these sampling seasons
his temper was not of the best Perhaps Mrs Saunders might have said
something concerning this report if she had been so disposed but unless
a discolored eye might be taken as evidence she never offered any The
injury to her eye she explained by saying that something flew up and
hit her This was no doubt true

But gossip aside Mr Saunders did not seem in good humor on this
particular morning A yellow cur of nondescript breed taken since the
fire in payment of a debt from Squealer Wixon who had described it
as a fustclass watchdog rose from its bed behind the cigar counter
yawned stretched and came slinking over to greet its master Web
forcibly hoisted it out of the door on the toe of his boot Its yelp of
pained surprise seemed to afford the business man considerable relief
for he moved more briskly afterward and proceeded to sweep the floor
with some degree of speed

The forenoon trade at the billiard room was never very lively and this
forenoon was no exception Bluey Batcheldor drifted in stepped into
the little room the door of which was lettered Ice Cream Parlor and
busied himself with a glass and bottle for a few moments Then he helped
himself to a cigar from the showcase and told his friend to chalk it
up This Mr Saunders didnt seem to care to do and there was a lively
argument At length Blueys promise to square up in a day or so was
accepted under protest and the customer departed

At halfpast eleven the man of business was dozing in a chair by the
stove and the watchdog having found it chilly outside and venturing
in was dozing near him The bell attached to the door rang vigorously
and both dog and man awoke with a start The visitor was Captain Eri

Now the Captain was perhaps the last person whom the proprietor of the
billiard room expected to see but a stranger never would have guessed
it In fact the stranger might reasonably have supposed that the
visitor was Mr Saunders dearest friend and that his call was a
pleasure long looked forward to

Why Capn exclaimed Web how are you Put her there Im glad
to see you lookin so well I said to Squealer the other day sI
Squealer I never see a man hold his age like Capn Hedge Ill be
blessed if he looks a day over forty I says Take off your coat wont
you

Somehow or other the Captain must have lost sight of Webs extended
hand Certainly the hand was large enough to be seen but he did not
take it He did however accept the invitation to remove his coat and
slipping out of the faded brown pea jacket threw it on a settee at the
side of the room His face was stern and his manner quiet and in spite
Of Mr Saunders flattering reference to his youthful appearance this
morning he looked at least more than a day past forty

But if Captain Eri was more than usually quiet and reserved Web
was unchanged and if he noticed that the handshake was declined said
nothing about it His smile was sweetness itself as he observed Well
Capn mighty modrate weather were having for this time of year aint
it Whats new down your way Thats right have a chair

The Captain had no doubt anticipated this cordial invitation for he
seated himself before it was given and crossing his legs extended his
dripping rubber boots toward the fire The rain was still falling and
it beat against the windows of the saloon in gusts

Web said Captain Eri set down a minute I want to talk to you

Why sure exclaimed the genial man of business pulling up another
chair Have a cigar wont you You dont come to see me very often
and I feels though we ought to celebrate Ha ha ha

No I guess not thank you was the answer Ill smoke my pipe if
its all the same to you

Mr Saunders didnt mind in the least but thought he would have a cigar
himself So he lit one and smoked in silence as the Captain filled his
pipe Web knew that this was something more than an ordinary social
visit Captain Eris calls at the billiard room were few and far
between The Captain for his part knew what his companion was
thinking and the pair watched each other through the smoke

The pipe drew well and the Captain sent a blue cloud whirling toward
the ceiling Then he asked suddenly Web how much money has Elsie
Preston paid you altogether

Mr Saunders started the least bit and his small eyes narrowed a
trifle But the innocent surprise in his reply was a treat to hear

Elsie Paid ME he asked

Yes How much has she paid you

I dont know what you mean

Yes you do Shes been payin you money reglar for more n a month I
want to know how much it is

Now Capn Hedge I dont know what youre talkin about Nobodys paid
me a cent except them thats owed me Who did you say Elsie Preston
Thats the schoolteacher aint it

Web youre a liar and always was but you neednt lie to me this
mornin cause it wont be healthy I dont feel like hearin it You
understand that do you

Mr Saunders thought it time to bluster a little He rose to his feet
threateningly

Capn Hedge he said no man ll call me a liar

Theres a precious few that calls you anything else

Youre an old man or Id

Never you mind how old I am A minute ago you said I didnt look more
n forty maybe I dont feel any older either

If that Preston girl has told you any

She hasnt told me anything She doesnt know that I know anything But
I do know I was in the entry upstairs at the schoolhouse for about ten
minutes last night

Mr Saunders start was perceptible this time He stood for a moment
without speaking Then he jerked the chair around threw himself into
it and said cautiously Well what of it

I come up from the house to git Elsie home cause twas rainin I was
told you was with her and I thought there was somethin crooked goin
on fact is I had a suspicion what twas So when I got up to the door
I didnt go in right away I jest stood outside

Listenin hey Spyin

Yup I dont think much of folks that listens ginrally speakin but
theres times when I blieve in it When Im foolin with a snake Id
jest as soon hit him from behind as in front I didnt hear much but I
heard enough to let me know that youd been takin money from that girl
right along And I think I know why

You do hey

Yup

Then Mr Saunders asked the question that a bigger rascal than he had
asked some years before He leaned back in his chair took a pull at his
cigar and said sneeringly Well what are you goin to do bout it

Im goin to stop it and Im goin to make you give the money back
How much has she paid you

None of your dn busness

The Captain rose to his feet Mr Saunders sprang up also and reached
for the coal shovel evidently expecting trouble But if he feared a
physical assault his fear was groundless Captain Eri merely took up
his coat

Maybe it aint none of my busness he said I aint a slectman
nor sheriff But theres such things in town and praps theyll be
intrested Seems to me that Ive heard that blackmailin has got folks
into States prison afore now

Is that so Never heard that folks that set fire to other peoples
propty got there did you Yes and folks that helps em gits there
too sometimes Who was it hid a coat a spell ago

It was Captain Eris turn to start He hesitated a moment tossed the
pea jacket back on the settee and sat down once more Mr Saunders
watched him grinning triumphantly

Well he said with a sneer

A coat you say

Yes a coat Maybe you know who hid it I can guess myself That coat
was burned some How do you spose it got burned And say who used to
wear a big white hat round these diggins Ah ha Who did

There was no doubt about the Captains start this time He wheeled
sharply in his chair and looked at the speaker

Humph he exclaimed You found that hat did you

Thats what I done And where do you think I found it Why right at
the back of my shed where the fire started And thered been a pile of
shavins there too and thered been kerosene on em Who smashed the
bottle over in the field hey

Captain Eri seemed to be thinking Web evidently set his own
interpretation on this silence for he went on raising his voice as he
did so

Did you think I was fool enough not to know who set that fire I knew
the night she burned and when I met Dr Palmer jest comin from
your house and he told me how old Baxter was took sick goin to the
fireoh yes GOINI went up on that hill right off and I hunted and
I found things and what I found I kept And what I found when I pulled
that burned shed to pieces I kept too And Ive got em yit

You have hey Dear dear

You bet I have And somebodys goin to pay for em Goin to pay pay
PAY Is that plain

The Captain made no answer He thrust his hands into his pockets and
looked at the stove dolefully so it seemed to the man of business

Fust off I thought Id have the old cuss jailed continued Mr
Saunders Then thinks I No that wont pay me for my buildin and my
busness hurt and all that So I waited for Baxter to git well meanin
to make him pay or go to the jug But he stayed sick apurpose I
blieve the mean whiteheaded psalmsingin

Captain Eri moved uneasily and broke in You got your insurance money
didnt you

Yes I did but whose fault is that Twant his nor any other darned
ComeOuters It dont pay me for my trouble nor it dont make me
square with the gang I genrally git even sometime or nother and Ill
git square now When that girl come here swellin round and puttin on
airs I see my chance and told her to pay up or her granddad would be
shoved into Ostable jail That give her the jumps I tell you

You wrote her a letter didnt you

You bet I did She come round to see me in a hurry Said she didnt
have no money I told her her granddad did an she could git that or go
to work and earn some I guess she thought shed ruther work Oh Ive
got her and her prayin houseburnin granddad where I want em and
Ive got you too Eri Hedge stickin your oar in Talk to me bout
blackmail For two cents Id jail the old man and you too

This was the real Mr Saunders He usually kept this side of his nature
for home use his wife was well acquainted with it

Captain Eri was evidently frightened His manner had become almost
apologetic

Well he said I wouldnt do that if I was you Web I heard you tell
Elsie last night she want payin you enough and I thought

I know what you thought You thought you could scare me You didnt
know I had the coat and hat did you Well what I said I stand by The
girl AINT payin me enough Fourteen dollars a week she gits and shes
only been givin up ten I want more I want

But here Captain Eri interrupted him

I guess that ll do he said calmly Youve told me what I wanted
to know Ten dollars a week sence the middle of November Bout seventy
dollars rough figgerin Now then hand it over

What

Hand over that seventy dollars

Hand over hell What are you talkin bout

The Captain rose and leaning over shook his forefinger in Mr
Saunders flabby red face

You lowlived thievin rascal he said Im givin you a chance you
dont deserve Either youll pay me that money youve stole from that
girl or Ill walk out of that door and when I come in again the sheriff
ll be with me Now which ll it be Think quick

Webs triumphant expression was gone and rage and malice had taken its
place He saw now that the Captain had tricked him into telling
more than he ought But he burst out again tripping over words in his
excitement

Think he yelled I dont need to think Bring in your sheriff Ill
march down to your house and Ill show him the man that set fire to my
buildin What ll you and that snivelin granddaughter of his do then
You make off to think a turrible lot of the old prayermachine cause
hes your chum Howd you like to see him took up for a firebug hey

I aint afraid of that

You aint You AINT Why not

Cause hes gone where you cant git at him He died jest afore I left
the house

Mr Saunders brandished fist fell heavily on the arm of his chair His
face turned white in patches and then flamed red again

Died he gasped

Died

Youyoure a liar

No I aint John Baxters dead He was a chum of mineyoure right
thereand if Id known a sneak like you was after him Id have been
here long afore this Why you

The Captains voice shook but he restrained himself and went on

Now you see where you stand dont you Longs John lived you had
the proof to convict him Ill own up to that much I hid the coat I
smashed the bottle The hat I didnt know bout I might have told you
at fust that all that didnt amount to anything but I thought Id wait
and let you tell me what more I wanted to know John Baxters gone
poor feller and all your proof aint worth a cent Not one red cent
Understand

It was quite evident that Mr Saunders did understand for his
countenance showed it But the bluster was not out of him yet

All right he said Anyhow the girls left and if she dont pay
Ill show her granddad up for what he was And Ill show you up too
Yes I will he shouted as this possibility began to dawn on him
Ill let folks know how you hid that coat andand all the rest of it

No you wont

Why wont I

Cause you wont dare to Youve been hittin at a sick man through a
girl neither of em could hit back But now youre doin busness with
me and I aint sick If you open your mouth to anybodyif you let
a soul know who set that fireIll walk straight to Jedge Baker and
Ill tell him the whole story Ill tell him what I did and why I did
it And THEN Ill tell him what you didhow you bullied money out of
that girl that hadnt no more to do with the fire than a baby If it
comes to facin a jury Ill take my chances but how bout you You
runnin a town nuisance that the slectmen are talkin of stoppin
already sellin rum by the drink when your license says it shant be
sold cept by the bottle Wherell YOUR character land you on a charge
of blackmail

And another thing The folks in this town knew John Baxter afore he was
like what hes been lately A good many of em swore by himyes
sir by mighty some of em loved him This is a lawabidin town but
sposejest spose I should go to some of the fellers that used to sail
with him and tell em what youve been up to Think youd stay here
long _I_ think youd move outon a rail

Captain Eri paused and sat on the arm of his chair grimly watching his
opponent whose turn for thinking had come The face of the billiard
magnate was an interesting study in expression during the Captains
speech From excited triumph it had fallen to fear and dejection and
now out of the wreck was appearing once more the oily smile the
sugared sweetness of the everyday Mr Saunders

Now Capn Hedge purred the reconstructed one you and me has always
been good friends We hadnt ought to fight like this I dont think
either of us wants to go to court Lets see if we cant fix the thing
up some way

Well fix it up when you pay me the seventy dollars

Now Capn Hedge taint likely Ive got seventy dollars in my pocket
Seems to me youre pretty hard on a poor feller thats jest been burnt
out I think wed ought to

How much HAVE you got

After a good deal of talk and protestation Mr Saunders acknowledged
being the possessor of twentysix dollars divided between the cash
drawer and his pocket This he reluctantly handed to the Captain

Then the Captain demanded pen ink and paper and when they were
brought he laboriously wrote out a screed to the effect that Webster
Saunders had received of Elsie Preston fortyfour dollars which sum he
promised to pay on demand

There he said pushing the writing materials across the table Sign
that

At first Mr Saunders positively refused to sign Then he intimated that
he had rather wait and think it over a little while Finally he affixed
his signature and spitefully threw the pen across the room

Captain Eri folded up the paper and put it in his pocket Then he rose
and put on his pea jacket

Now theres jest one thing more he said Trot out that coat and
hat

What do you mean

Trot out that coat and hat of Johns I want em

I shant do it

All right then Its all off Ill step over and see the Jedge Youll
hear from him and me later

Hold on a minute Capn Youre in such a everlastin hurry I dont
care anything bout the old duds but I dont knows I know where they
are Seems to me theyre up to the house somewheres Ill give em to
you tomorrer

Youll give em to me right now Ill tend shop while you go after
em

For a moment it looked as though the man of business would rebel
outright But the Captain was so calm and evidently so determined to do
exactly what he promised that Web gave up in despair Muttering that
maybe they were round the place after all he went into the back
room and reappeared with the burned coat and the scorched white felt
hat Slamming them down on the counter he said sulkily There they be
Any more of my propty youd like to have

Captain Eri didnt answer Coolly tearing off several sheets of wrapping
paper from the roll at the back of the counter he made a bundle of the
hat and coat and tucked it under his arm Then he put on his own hat
and started for the door

Goodmornin he said

The temper of the exasperated Mr Saunders flared up in a final
outburst

You think youre almighty smart dont you he growled between his
teeth Ill square up with you by and by

The Captain turned sharply his hand on the latch

I wish youd try he said I jest wish to God youd try Ive held in
more n I thought I could when I come up here but if you want to start
a reel fustclass rumpus one that ll land you where you blong and rid
this town of you for keeps jest try some of your tricks on me And if
I hear of one word that youve said bout this whole busness Ill know
its time to start in Now you can keep still or fight jest as you
please I tell you honest I most wish youd fight

The door slammed Mr Saunders opened it again and gazed vindictively
after the bulky figure splashing through the slush The dog came
sneaking up and rubbed his nose against his masters hand it was an
impolitic move on his part

Git out roared Web delighted at the opportunity You
goodfornothin pup Hows that set

That was a kick that doubled the cur up against the settee As it
scrambled to its feet Mr Saunders kicked it again And then the
watchdog exhibited the first evidence of spirit that it had ever been
known to show With a snarl as the man turned away it settled its
teeth into the calf of his leg and then shot out of the door and with
its tail between its legs went down the road like a yellow cannon ball



CHAPTER XVII

THROUGH FIRE AND WATER


It was trueJohn Baxter was dead His violent outbreak of the previous
afternoon had hastened the end that the doctor had prophesied There was
no harrowing death scene The weatherbeaten old face grew calmer and
the sleep sounder until the tide went outthat was all It was like a
peaceful coming into port after a rough voyage No one of the watchers
about the bed could wish him back not even Elsie who was calm and
brave through it all When it was over she went to her room and Mrs
Snow went with her Captain Eri went out to make his call upon Mr
Saunders

The funeral was one of the largest ever held in Orham The little house
was crowded Old friends who had drifted away from the fanatic in his
latter days came back to pay tribute to the strong man whom they had
known and loved There was some discussion among the captains as to
who should preach the funeral sermon Elsie had left this question
to Captain Eri for settlement and the trio and Mrs Snow went into
executive session immediately

If John had had the settlin of it himself observed Eri hed have
picked Perley there aint no doubt bout that

I know it said Captain Perez but you must remember that John want
himself for years and what hed have done now aint what hed have done
fore he broke down I hate to think of Perleys doin it somehow

Isnt Mr Perley a good man asked the housekeeper

Hes good enough furs I know replied Captain Jerry but I know
what Perez means A funeral seems to me ought to be a quiet soothin
sort of a thing and there aint nothin soothin bout ComeOuter
preachin Hell beller and rave round Im fraid and stir up poor
Elsie so she wont never git over it

I know it agreed Captain Eri Thats what Ive been afraid of And
yit he added I should feel we was doin somethin jest opposite from
what John would like if we had anybody else

Couldnt you see Mr Perley beforehand suggested Mrs Snow and tell
him jest the kind of sermon he must preach Tell him it must be quiet
and comfortin and

And short Captain Eri finished the sentence for her I guess thats
the way well have to settle it Ill make him understand one thing
thoughhe mustnt drag in rum sellin and all the rest of it by the
heels If he does IllI dont know what Ill do to him

The interview with the Reverend Perley that followed this conversation
must have been effective for the sermon was surprisingly brief and as
surprisingly calm In fact so rational was it that a few of the more
extreme among the preachers following were a bit disappointed and
inquired anxiously as to their leaders health after the ceremony was
over

The procession of carryalls and buggies followed the hearse to the
cemetery among the pines and as the mourners stood about the grave
the winter wind sang through the evergreen branches a song so like the
roar of the surf that it seemed like a dirge of the sea for the mariner
who would sail no more As they were clearing away the supper dishes
that night Captain Eri said to Mrs Snow Well Johns gone I wonder
if hes happier now than he has been for the last ten years or so

I think he is was the answer

Well so do I but if he hadnt been a Come Outer I dont spose
Brother Perley and his crowd would have figgered that he had much show
Seems sometimes as if folks like thatreel goodhearted folks too
that wouldnt hurt a flygit solid comfort out of the feelin that
everybody that dont agree with em is bound to everlastin torment I
dont know but its wicked to say it but honest it seems as if them
kind would bout as soon give up the hopes of Heaven for themselves as
they would the satisfaction of knowin twas tother place for the other
feller

To which remark the somewhat shocked housekeeper made no reply

The following day Elsie went back to her school Captain Eri walked up
with her and on the way told her of his discovery of her secret and
of his interview with Web Saunders It was exactly as the Captain had
surmised The note she had received on the evening of the return from
the lifesaving station was from the proprietor of the billiard
saloon and in it he hinted at some dire calamity that overshadowed her
grandfather and demanded an immediate interview She had seen him that
night and under threat of instant exposure had promised to pay the sum
required for silence She had not wished to use her grandfathers money
for this purpose and so had taken the position as teacher

Well said the Captain I wish youd have come to me right away and
told me the whole busness Twould have saved a pile of trouble

The young lady stopped short and faced him

Captain Eri she said how could I I was sure grandfather had set
the fire I knew how ill he was and I knew that any shock might kill
him Besides how could I drag you into it when you had done so much
already It would have been dreadful No I thought it all out and
decided I must face it alone

Well I tell you this Elsie pretty ginrally a mean dog ll bite if
he sees youre afraid of him The only way to handle that kind is to run
straight at him and kick the meanness out of him The more he barks
the harder you ought to kick If you run away once it ll be mighty
uncomftable every time you go past that house But never mind I
callate this pticlar pup wont bite Ive pulled his teeth I guess
Whats your plans now Goin to keep on with the school or go back to
Boston

Miss Preston didnt know she said she had not yet decided and as the
schoolhouse was reached by this time the Captain said no more

There was however another question that troubled him and that seemed
to call for almost immediate settlement It was What should be done
with Mrs Snow The housekeeper had been hired to act as such while
John Baxter was in the house Now he was gone and there remained the
original marriage agreement between Captain Jerry and the widow and
honor called for a decision one way or the other Mrs Snow of course
said nothing about it neither did Captain Jerry and Captain Eri felt
that he must take the initiative as usual But somehow he was not as
prompt as was his wont and sat evening after evening whittling at the
clipper and smoking thoughtfully And another week went by

Captain Perez might and probably would have suggested action upon this
important matter had not his mind been taken up with what to him was
the most important of all He had made up his mind to ask Patience Davis
to marry him

Love is like the measles it goes hard with a man past fifty and
Captain Perez was severely smitten The decision just mentioned was not
exactly a brandnew one his mind had been made up for some time but he
lacked the courage to ask the momentous question Something the lady
had said during the first stages of their acquaintance made a great
impression on the Captain She gave it as her opinion that a man who
loved a woman should be willing to go through fire and water to win her
Captain Perez went home that night pondering deeply

Fire and water he mused Thats a turrible test But shes a
wonderful woman and would expect it of a feller I wonder if I could do
it seems s if I would now but flesh is weak and I might flunk and
that would settle it Fire and water My my thats awful

So the Captain delayed and Miss Patience who had cherished hopes found
need of a good share of the virtue for which she was named

But one afternoon at the end of the week following that of the funeral
Perez set out for a call upon his intended which he meant should be a
decisive one He had screwed his courage up to the top notch and as he
told Captain Eri afterwards he meant to hail her and git his bearins
if he foundered the next minute

He found the lady alone for old Mrs Mayo had gone with her son whose
name was Abner to visit a cousin in Harniss and would not be back
until late in the evening Miss Patience was very glad to have company
and it required no great amount of urging to persuade the infatuated
swain to stay to tea When the meal was overthey washed the dishes
together and the Captain was so nervous that it is a wonder there was a
whole plate leftthe pair were seated in the parlor Then said Captain
Perez turning red and hesitating Pashy do you know what a feller
told me bout you

Now this remark was purely a pleasant fiction for the Captain was
about to undertake a compliment and was rather afraid to shoulder the
entire responsibility

No Im sure I dont Perez replied Miss Davis smiling sweetly

Well a feller told me you was the best housekeeper in Orham He said
that the man that got you would be lucky

This was encouraging Miss Patience colored and simpered a little

Land sake she exclaimed Whoever told you such rubbish as that
Besides with downcast eyes I guess no man would ever want me

Oh I dont know The Captain moved uneasily in his chair as if he
contemplated hitching it nearer to that occupied by his companion
I guess theres plenty would be mighty glad to git you Anyhow
therestheres one thatthatI callate the fogs thick as ever
dont you

But Miss Patience didnt mean to give up in this way

What was it you was goin to say she asked by way of giving the
bashful one another chance

I was goin to say Pashy thatthatI asked if you thought the fog
was as thick as ever

Oh dear me Yes I spose likely tis was the discouraged answer

Seems to me I never see such weather for this time of year The ice
is all out of the bay and there aint a bit of wind and its warm as
summer pretty nigh Kind of a stormbreeder Im afraid

Well Im glad youre here to keep me compny Ive never been sole
alone in this house afore and I should be dreadful lonesome if you
hadnt come This was offered as a fresh bait

Pashy Ive got somethin I wanted to ask you Do you think you
coulderer

What Perez

I wanted to ask youthe Captain swallowed several timesto ask
youWhat in the nation is that

Oh thats nothin only the hens squawkin Go on

Yes but hens dont squawk this time of night thout they have some
reason to Its that fox come back thats what tis

Miss Patience earlier in the evening had related a harrowing tale of
the loss of two of Mrs Mayos best Leghorns that had gone to furnish a
Sunday meal for a marauding fox As the said Leghorns were the pride of
the old ladys heart even the impending proposal was driven from Miss
Davis mind

Oh Perez you dont spose tis the fox do you

Yes MAAM I do Wheres the gun

There tis behind the door but there aint a mite of shot in the
house Abners been goin to fetch some from the store for I dont know
how long but hes always forgot it

Never mind Ill pound the critter with the butt Come quick and bring
a lamp

The noise in the henyard continued and when they opened the door it was
louder than ever

Hes in the henhouse whispered Miss Patience He must have gone in
that hole at the side that had the loose board over it

All right murmured the Captain You go round with the lamp and open
the door That ll scare him and Ill stand at the hole and thump him
when he comes out

So shielding the lamp with her apron the guardian of Mrs Mayos
outraged Leghorns tiptoed around to the henhouse door while Captain
Perez brandishing the gun like a club took up his stand by the hole at
the side

Without the lamp the darkness was pitchy The Captain stooping down to
watch saw something coming out of the holesomething that was alive
and moved He swung the gun above his head and bringing it down with
all his might knocked into eternal oblivion the little life remaining
in the finest Leghorn rooster

Consarn it yelled the executioner stooping and laying his hand on
the victim Ive killed a hen

Just then there came a scream from the other side of the henhouse
followed by a crash and the sound of a fall Running around the corner
the alarmed Perez saw his ladylove stretched upon the ground groaning
dismally

Great land of Goshen he cried Pashy are you hurt

Oh Perez gasped the fallen one Oh Perez

This pitiful appeal had such an effect upon the Captain that he dropped
upon his knees and raising Miss Davis head in his hands begged her to
say she wasnt killed After some little time she obligingly complied
and then having regained her breath explained the situation

What had happened was this The fox having selected his victim the
rooster had rendered it helpless and was pushing it out of the hole
ahead of him The Captain had struck the rooster just as Miss Patience
opened the door and the fox seizing this chance of escape had dodged
by the lady upsetting her as he went

Well she said laughing theres no great harm done Im sorry for
the rooster but I guess the fox had fixed him anyway Oh my soul and
body look there

Perez turned looked as directed and saw the henhouse in flames

The lighted lamp which Miss Patience had dropped as she fell lay
broken on the floor and the blazing oil had run in every direction The
flames were making such headway that they both saw there was practically
no chance of saving the building The frightened hens were huddled in
the furthest corner gazing stupidly at the fire

Oh those poor Leghorns wailed Miss Patience Those hens Mrs Mayo
thought the world of and left me to look out for Last thing she asked
me was to be sure they was fed And now theyll be all burned up What
SHALL I do

Here the lady began to cry

Pashy roared the Captain whom the sight of his charmers tears had
driven almost wild dont say another word Ill save them hens or git
cooked along with em

And turning up his coat collar as though he was going into a
refrigerator instead of a burning building Captain Perez sprang through
the door

Miss Davis screamed wildly to him to come back and danced about
wringing her hands The interior of the henhouse was now a mass of black
smoke from which the voices of the Captain and the Leghorns floated in
a discordant medley something like this

Hold still you lunatics Squawk squawk Druther be roasted than
have me catch you hadnt you Squawk squawk Akershew Land
Im smothered NOW Ive got you Thunderation Hold STILL HOLD STILL I
tell you

Just as the agonized Miss Patience was on the point of fainting the
little window at the back of the shanty was thrown open and two hens
like feathered comets shot through it Then the red face of the Captain
appeared for an instant as he caught his breath with a Woosh and
dived back again This performance was repeated six times the Captains
language and the compliments he paid the hens becoming more picturesque
every moment

At length he announced Thats all thank goodness and began to climb
through the window This was a difficult task for the window was narrow
and in spite of what Captain Eri had called his ingyrubber make up
Captain Perez stuck fast

Catch hold of my hands and haul will you Pashy he pleaded Thats
it pull hard Its gittin sort of muggy in behind here Ill never
complain at havin cold feet agin if I git out of this Now then Ugh
Here we be

He came out with a jerk like a cork out of a bottle and rolled on the
ground at his ladys feet

Oh Perez she exclaimed are you hurt

Nothin but my feelins growled the rescuer scrambling upright I
read a book once by a feller named Joshua Billins or somethin like
it He was a ignorant chapcouldnt spell two words rightbut he had
considerble sense He said a hen was a darn fool and he was right
shes all that

The Captains face was blackened and his clothes were scorched but his
spirit was undaunted

Pashy he said do you realize that if we dont git help this whole
shebang house and all will burn down

Perez you dont mean it

I wouldnt swear that I didnt Look how that things blazin Theres
the barn tother side of it and the house tother side of that

But cant you and me put it out

I dont dare resk it No sir Weve got to git help and git it in a
hurry too

Wont somebody from the station see the light and come over

Not in this fog You cant see a hundred foot No Ive got to go right
off Good land I never thought Is the horse gone

No the horse is here Abner took one of the store horses to go to
Harniss with But he did take the buggy and theres no other carriage
but the old carryall and thats almost tumblin to pieces

I was callatin to go horseback

What and leave me here alone with the house afire No indeed If you
go Im goin too

Well then the carrylls got to do whether or no Git on a shawl or
somethin while I harness up

It was a frantic harnessing but it was done in a hurry and the
ramshackle old carryall dusty and cobwebbed was dragged out of the
barn and Horace Greeley the horse was backed into the shafts As they
drove out of the yard the flames were roaring through the roof of the
henhouse and the lath fence surrounding it was beginning to blaze

Everythings so wet from the fog and the melted snow observed the
Captain that it ll take some time for the fire to git to the barn
If we can git a gang here we can save the house easy and maybe more By
mighty he ejaculated I tell you what well do Ill drive across the
ford and git Luther and some of the station men to come right across
Then Ill go on to the village to fetch more It was seven when I looked
at the clock as we come in from washin dishes so the tide must be
still goin out and the ford jest right Git dap

Hurry all you can for goodness sake Is this as fast as we can go

Fast as we can go with this everlastin Noahs Ark Heavens how them
wheels squeal

The axles aint been greased for I dont know when Abner was going to
have the old carriage chopped up for kindlin wood

Lucky for him and us taint chopped up now Git dap slowpoke Better
chop the horse up too while hes bout it

The last remark the Captain made under his breath

My gracious how dark it is Think you can find the crossin

GOT to find it thats all Tis dark thats a fact

It was They had gone but a few hundred yards yet the fire was already
merely a shapeless red smudge on the foggy blackness behind them
Horace Greeley pounded along at a jog and when the Captain slapped him
with the end of the reins broke into a jerky gallop that was slower
than the trot

Stop your hoppin up and down commanded Perez whose temper was
becoming somewhat frayed You make me think of the walkin beam on a
steamboat If youd stop tryin to fly and go straight ahead wed do
better

They progressed in this fashion for some distance Then Miss Davis from
the curtained depths of the back seat spoke again

Oh dear me she exclaimed Are you sure youre on the right track
Seems s if we MUST be abreast the station and this roads awful
rough

Captain Perez had remarked the roughness of the road The carryall was
pitching from one hummock to another and Horace Greeley stumbled once
or twice

Whoa commanded the Captain Then he got down lit a match and
shielding it with his hands scrutinized the ground Im kind of
fraid he said presently that weve got off the road somehow But we
must be bout opposite the crossin Im goin to drive down and see if
I can find it

He turned the horses head at right angles from the way they were going
and they pitched onward for another hundred yards Then they came out
upon the hard smooth sand and heard the water lapping on the shore
Captain Perez got out once more and walked along the strand bending
forward as he walked Soon Miss Patience heard him calling

Ive found it I guess he said coming back to the vehicle Anyhow
it looks like it Well be over in a few minutes now Git dap you

Horace Greeley shivered as the cold water splashed his legs but waded
bravely in They moved further from the shore and the water seemed to
grow no deeper

Guess this is the crossin all right said the Captain who had
cherished some secret doubts Heres the deep part comin Well be
across in a jiffy

The water mounted to the hubs then to the bottom of the carryall Miss
Davis feet grew damp and she drew them up

Oh Perez she faltered are you sure this is the ford

Dont git scared Pashy I guess maybe weve got a little to one side
of the track Ill turn round and try again

But Horace Greeley was of a different mind From long experience he knew
that the way to cross a ford was to go straight ahead The bottom of the
carryall was awash

Port your hellum you lubber shouted the driver pulling with all his
might on one rein Heave to Come bout Gybe consarn you gybe

Then Horace Greeley tried to obey orders but it was too late He
endeavored to touch bottom with his forelegs but could not tried to
swim with his hind ones but found that impossible then wallowed wildly
to one side and snapped a shaft and the rotten whiffletree short off
The carryall tipped alarmingly and Miss Patience screamed

Whoa yelled the agitated Perez Vast heavin belay

The animal as much frightened by his drivers shouts as by the water
shot ahead and tried to tear himself loose The other sunwarped and
rotten shaft broke The carryall was now floating with the water
covering the floor

No use Ill have to cut away the wreck or well be on our beam ends
shouted the Captain

He took out his jackknife and reaching over severed the traces Horace
Greeley gave another wallow and finding himself free disappeared in
the darkness amid a lather of foam The carriage now well out in the
channel drifted with the current

Dont cry Pashy said the Captain endeavoring to cheer his sobbing
companion we aint shark bait yit As the song used to say

 Were afloat were afloat
 And the rover is free

Ive shipped aboard of most every kind of craft he added but
blessed if I ever expected to be skipper of a carryall

But Miss Patience shut up in the back part of the carriage like a water
nymph in her cave still wept hysterically So Captain Perez continued
his dismal attempt at facetiousness

The main thing he said is to keep her on an even keel If
she teeters to one side you teeter to tother Drat that fox he
ejaculated I thought when Webs place burned wed had fire enough to
last for one spell but it never rains but it pours

Oh dear sobbed the lady Now everything ll burn up and theyll
blame me for it Well Ill be drownded anyway so I shant be there to
hear em Oh dear dear

Oh dont talk that way Were driftin somewheres but were spinnin
round so I cant tell which way Judas he exclaimed more soberly I
remember now it aint but a little past seven oclock and the tides
goin out

Of course it is resignedly and well drift into the breakers in the
bay and that ll be the end

No no I guess not We aint dead yit If I had an oar or somethin to
steer this clipper with maybe we could git into shoal water As tis
well have to manage her the way Ote Wixon used to manage his wife by
lettin her have her own way

They floated in silence for a few moments Then Miss Patience who had
bravely tried to stifle her sobs said with chattering teeth Perez
Im pretty nigh froze to death

It will be remembered that the Captain had spoken of the weather as
being almost as warm as summer This was a slight exaggeration It
happened fortunately for the castaways that this particular night
coming as it did just at the end of the long thaw was the mildest of
the winter and there was no wind but the air was chill and the damp
fog raw and biting

Well now you mention it said Captain Perez it IS cold aint it
Ive a good mind to jump overboard and try to swim ashore and tow the
carryall

Dont you DO it My land if YOU should drown what would become of ME

It was the tone of this speech as much as the words that hit the
Captain hard He himself almost sobbed as he said

Pashy I want you to try to git over on this front seat with me Then
I can put my coat round you and you wont be so cold Take hold of my
hand

Miss Patience at first protested that she never could do it in the
world the carriage would upset and that would be the end But her
companion urged her to try and at last she did so It was a risky
proceeding but she reached the front seat somehow and the carryall
still remained rightsideup Luckily in the channel between the
beaches there was not the slightest semblance of a wave

Captain Perez pulled off his coat and wrapped it about his protesting
companion He was obliged to hold it in place and he found the task
rather pleasing

Oh youre SO good murmured Miss Patience What should I have done
without you

Hush Guess youd have been better off Youd never gone after that
fox if it hadnt been for me and there wouldnt have been none of this
fuss

Oh dont say that Youve been so brave Anyhow well die together
thats a comfort

Pashy said Captain Perez solemnly its mighty good to hear you say
that

It is perhaps needless to explain that the dying portion of
the ladys speech was not that referred to by the Captain the
word together was what appealed to him Miss Patience apparently
understood

Is it she said softly

Yesyes tis The arm holding the coat about the ladys shoulder
tightened just a little The Captain had often dreamed of something like
this but never with quite these surroundings However he was rapidly
becoming oblivious to such trivial details as surroundings

Pashy he said huskily Ive been thinkin of you considerble
lately Fact is IIwell I come down today apurpose to ask you
somethin I know its a queer place to ask it andand I spose its
kind of sudden butwillwill youBreakers by mighty

The carryall had suddenly begun to rock and there were streaks of foam
about it Now it gave a most alarming heave grounded swung clear and
tipped yet more

Were capsizin yelled Perez Hang on to me Pashy

But Miss Patience didnt intend to let this perhaps the final
opportunity slip As she told her brother afterward she would have
made him say it then if they had been two fathom under water

Will I what Perez she demanded

The carryall rose on two wheels and begun to turn over but the Captain
did not notice it The arms of his hearts desire were about his neck
and he was looking into her eyes

Will you marry me he gasped

Yes answered Miss Patience and they went under together

The Captain staggered to his feet and dragged his chosen bride to hers
The icecold water reached their shoulders And like a flash as they
stood there came a torrent of rain and a wind that drove the fog before
it like smoke Captain Perez saw the shore with its silhouetted bushes
only a few yards away Beyond that in the blackness was a light a
flickering blaze that rose and fell and rose and fell again

The Captain dragged Miss Patience to the beach

Run he chattered run or well turn into icicles Come on

With his arm about her waist Perez guided his dripping companion as
fast as they could run toward the light And as they came nearer to it
they saw that it flickered about the blackened ruins of a henhouse and
a lath fence

It was Mrs Mayos henhouse and Mrs Mayos fence Their adventurous
journey had ended where it began

You see Eri said Captain Perez as he told his friend the story that
night that clock in the dining room that I looked at hadnt been goin
for a week the mainspring was broke Twant seven oclock twas
nearer nine when the fire started and the tide want goin out twas
comin in I drove into the water too soon missed the crossin and we
jest drifted back home agin The horse had more sense than I did We
found him in the barn waiting for us

Abner Mayo had piled against the back of his barn a great heap of damp
seaweed that he intended using in the spring as a fertilizer The fire
had burned until it reached this seaweed and then had gone no further
The rain extinguished the last spark

Well by mighty exclaimed Captain Perez for at least the tenth time
as he sat in the kitchen wrapped in an old ulster of Mr Mayos and
toasting his feet in the oven if I dont feel like a fool All that
scare and wet for nothin

Oh not for nothin Perez said Miss Patience looking tenderly down
into his face

Well no not for nothin by a good deal Ive got you by it and
thats everything But say Pashy and the Captain looked awed by the
coincidence I went through fire and water to git you



CHAPTER XVIII

THE SINS OF CAPTAIN JERRY


Captain Perez made a clean breast of it to Captain Eri when he reached
home that night It was after twelve oclock but he routed his friend
out of bed to tell him the news and the story Captain Eri was not as
surprised to hear of the engagement as he pretended to be for he had
long ago made up his mind that Perez meant business this time But the
tale of the fire and the voyage in the carryall tickled him immensely
and he rolled back and forth in the rocker and laughed until his side
ached

I spose it does sound kind of ridiclous said the accepted suitor in
a rather aggrieved tone but it want haf so funny when twas goin
on Fust I thought Id roast to death then I thought Id freeze and
then I thought Id drown

Perez said the panting Eri youre a wonder Im goin to tell Sol
Bangs bout you next time I see him Hell want you to enter in the
races next Fourth of July Weve had tub races and the like of that but
a carryall sailin match ll be somethin new Ill back you against the
town though You can count on me

Now look here Eri Hedge if you tell a livin soul bout it Ill

All right shipmate all right but its too good to keep You ought
to write a book one of them kind like Josiah used to read Call it
The Carryall Pirate or The Terror of the Channel hey Gee youd be
famous But say old man he added more seriously Ill shake hands
with you I blieve youve got a good woman one that ll make it smooth
sailin for you the rest of your life I wish you both luck

Captain Perez shook hands very gravely He was still a little suspicious
of his chums propensity to tease It did not tend to make him less
uneasy when a little later Captain Eri opened the parlor door and
whispered Say Perez Ive jest thought of somethin What are you
goin to say to Mlissy Busteed Her heart ll be broke

Aw git out was the disgusted answer

Well I only mentioned it Folks have had to pay heavy for breach of
promise fore now Goodnight

Perez manfully told of his engagement at the breakfast table next
morning although he said nothing concerning the rest of his adventures
He was rather taken aback to find that no one seemed greatly surprised
Everyone congratulated him of course and it was gratifying to discern
the high opinion of the future Mrs Ryder held by Mrs Snow and the
rest Captain Jerry solemnly shook hands with him after the meal was
over and said Perez you done the right thing Theres nothin like
married life after all

Then why dont you try it yourself was the unexpected question
Seems to me well have to settle that matter of yours pretty soon I
meant to speak to Eri bout it fore this but Ive had so much on my
mind I will tonight when he comes back from fishin

Captain Jerry made no further remarks but walked thoughtfully away

So that evening when they were together in Captain Jerrys room after
supper Perez true to his promise said

Eri it seems to me weve got to do somethin bout Mrs Snow She was
hired to be housekeeper while John was sick Now hes dead and shell
think its queer if we dont settle that marryin busness Aint that
so

Humph grunted Captain Jerry Perez is in a mighty sweat to git other
folks married jest cause hes goin to be I dont see why she cant
keep on bein housekeeper jest the same as shes always been

Well I do and so do you and you know it We agreed to the
housekeepin busness jest as a sort of put off Now we cant put off
no longer Mrs Snow come down here cause we advertised for a wife and
shes been so everlastin good that I feel most ashamed every time I
think of it No use youve got to ask her to marry you He has hasnt
he Eri

Yes answered Captain Eri laconically

The sacrifice squirmed I hate to ask he said Why dont we wait a
spell and let her say somethin fust

That WOULD be nice wouldnt it Shes that kind of a woman aint
she sputtered Perez No you bet she aint What shed say would be
to give her opinion of us and our manners and walk out of the house bag
and baggage and I wouldnt blame her for doin it

Praps she wouldnt have me She never said she would

Never said she would Have you ever asked her Shes had all this time
to larn to know you in and I callate if she was willin to think
bout it fore she ever see you shed be more willin now Aint that
so Eri

And again Captain Eri said shortly Yes

I wish youd mind your own consarns and give me time protested
Captain Jerry

Time How much time do you want Land of Goshen I should think youd
had time enough Why

Oh let up snorted the persecuted Why dont you git married
yourself and bring Pashy over to keep house What we started to git
in the fust place was jest a wife for one of us that would keep things
shipshape and now

The withering look of scorn that Perez bent upon him caused him to
hesitate and stop Captain Perez haughtily marched to the door

Eri he said I aint goin to waste my time talkin to aa dogfish
like him He aint wuth it

Hold on now Perez pleaded the discomfited sacrifice alarmed at his
comrades threatened desertion I was only foolin Cant you take a
joke I havent said I wouldnt do it I think a heap of Mrs Snow its
only that I aint got the spunk to ask her thats all

Humph it dont take much spunk replied the successful wooer
forgetful of his own past trepidation

Well Captain Jerry wriggled and twisted but saw no loophole Well
give me a month to git up my courage in and

A month A months ridiclous aint it Eri

Yes

Well three weeks then

This offer too was rejected Then Captain Jerry held out for a
fortnightfor ten days Finally it was settled that within one week
from that very night he was to offer his heart and hand to the lady from
Nantucket He pledged his solemn word to do it

There exclaimed the gratified Captain Perez Thats a good job done
He wont never be sorry for it will he Eri

And Captain Eri made his fourth contribution to the conversation

No he said


Josiah went up to the postoffice late in the afternoon of the next day
The able seaman was behaving himself remarkably well He had become a
real help to Captain Eri and the latter said that sailing alone would
be doubly hard when his foremast hand went back to school again which
he was to do very shortly for Josiah meant to accept the Captains
offer and to try for the Annapolis appointment when the time came

The boy came back with the mail and an item of news The mail a paper
only he handed to Mrs Snow and the news he announced at the supper
table as follows

Mr Hazeltines goin to leave the cable station he said

Goin to leave repeated the housekeeper what for

I dont know maam All I know is what I heard Mr Wingate say He
said Mr Hazeltine was goin to get through over at the station pretty
soon He said one of the operators told him so

Well for the lands sake Did you know anything bout it Eri

Why yes a little I met Hazeltine yesterday and he told me that
some folks out West had made him a pretty good offer and he didnt know
whether to take it or not Said the salary was good and the whole thing
looked sort of temptin He hadnt decided what to do yit Thats all
there is to it

There was little else talked about during the meal Captain Perez
Captain Jerry and Mrs Snow argued surmised and questioned Captain
Eri who said little Elsie said almost nothing and went to her room
shortly after the dishes were washed

Humph exclaimed Captain Perez when they were alone I guess your
matchmakin schemes up spout Jerry

And for a wonder Captain Jerry did not contradict him

The weather changed that night and it grew cold rapidly In the morning
the pump was frozen and Captain Jerry and Mrs Snow spent some time and
much energy in thawing it out It was later than usual when the former
set out for the schoolhouse As he was putting on his cap Elsie
suggested that he wait for her as she had some lessons to prepare and
wanted an hour or so to herself at her desk So they walked on together
under a cloudy sky The mud in the road was frozen into all sorts of
fantastic shapes and the little puddles had turned to ice

That thaw was a weatherbreeder sure enough observed Captain Jerry
Well git a storm out of this fore were done

It seems to me said Elsie that the winter has been a very mild one
From what I had heard I supposed you must have some dreadful gales here
but there has been none so far

Well git em yit Februarys jist the time Git a good notheaster
goin and youll think the whole house is comin down Nothin to what
they used to have though cordin to tell Capn Jonadab Wixon used to
swear that his grandfather told him bout a gale that blew the hair all
off a dog and then the wind changed of a sudden and blew it all on
again

Elsie laughed That must have been a blow she said

Yes Capn Jonadabs somethin of a blow himself so he ought to be a
good jedge The outer beach is the place that catches it when theres
a gale on Oh say that reminds me I spose you was glad to hear the
news last night

What news

Why that bout Mr Hazeltines goin away Youre glad hes goin of
course

Miss Preston did not answer immediately Instead she turned and looked
wonderingly at her companion

Why should I be glad pray she asked

Why I dont know I jest took it for granted you would be You didnt
want him to come and see you and if he was gone he couldnt come so

Just a minute please What makes you think I didnt want Mr Hazeltine
to call

And now it was the Captains turn to stare and hesitate

What makes me think he gasped Whyyou told me so yourself

_I_ told you so Im certain that I never told you anything of the
kind

Captain Jerry stood stockstill and if ever a face expressed complete
amazement it was his

Elsie Preston he ejaculated are you losin your memry or what
Didnt you pitch into me hotfoot for lettin him be alone with you
Didnt you give me hark from the tomb for gittin up and goin away
Didnt you say his calls was perfect torture to you and that you had to
be decent to him jest out of common politeness Now didnt you

Oh that was it No of course I didnt say any such thing

You DIDNT Why I heard you Land of love my ears smarted for a week
afterward I aint had sech a goin over sence mother used to git at me
for goin in swimmin on Sunday And now you say you didnt say it

I didnt You misunderstood me I did object to your leaving the room
every time he called and making me appear so ridiculous and I did
say that his visits might be a torture for all that you knew to the
contrary but I certainly didnt say that they WERE

SUFFERIN And you aint glad he stopped comin

The air of complete indifference assumed by the young lady was a
triumph

Why of course she said Mr Hazeltine is a free agent and I dont
know of any reason why he should be compelled to go where he doesnt
wish to go I enjoyed his society and Im sure Captain Eri and Mrs
Snow enjoyed it too but it is quite evident that he did not enjoy
ours so I dont see that there need be any more said on the subject

Captain Jerry was completely crushed If the gale described by the
redoubtable grandsire of Jonadab Wixon had struck him he could not have
been more upset

My my my he murmured And after my beggin his pardon and all

Begging his pardon For what

Why for leavin you two alone Of course after you pitched into me
so I see how foolish Id been actin and Ihonest I didnt sleep
scursely a bit that night thinkin bout it Thinks I If Elsie feels
that way why there aint no doubt that Mr Hazeltine feels the same
There want but one thing to be done When a man makes a mistake if he
is any kind of a man he owns up and does his best to straighten things
out Twant easy to do but dutys duty and the next time I see Mr
Hazeltine I told him the whole thing and

You DID

Sartin I did

What did you tell him

They had stopped on the sidewalk nearly opposite the postoffice Each
was too much engrossed in the conversation to pay any heed to anything
else If the few passersby thought it strange that the schoolmistress
should care to loiter out of doors on that cold and disagreeable
morning they said nothing about it One young man in particular who
standing just inside the postoffice door was buttoning his overcoat
and putting on his gloves looked earnestly at the pair but he too
said nothing

Why I told him said Captain Jerry in reply to the question how
you didnt like to have me go out of the room when he was there Course
I told him I didnt mean to do nothin out of the way Then he asked me
some more questions and I answered em best I could andwell I guess
thats bout all

Did you tell him that I said his visits were a torture

Why the Captain shuffled his feet uneasilyseems to me I said
somethin bout itnot jest that you know but somethin Fact is I
was so muddleheaded and upset that I dont know exactly what I did say
Anyhow he said twas all right so there aint nothin to worry bout

Captain Jeremiah Burgess exclaimed Elsie Then she added What MUST
he think of me

Oh Ill fix that exclaimed the Captain Ill see him some time
today and Ill tell him you didnt mean it Why I declare Yes tis
There he is now Hi Mr Hazeltine Come here a minute

A mischievous imp was certainly directing Captain Jerrys movements
Ralph had almost for the first time since he came to Orham paid an
early morning visit to the office in order to send an important letter
in the first mail The slamming of the door had attracted the Captains
attention and in response to the hail Mr Hazeltine crossed the road

And then Captain Jerry felt his arm clutched with a grip that meant
business as Miss Preston whispered Dont you dare say one word to him
about it Dont you DARE

If Ralph had been surprised by the request to join the couple he was
more surprised by the reception he received Elsies face was crimson
and as for the Captain he looked like a man who had suddenly been left
standing alone in the middle of a pond covered with very thin ice

The electrician bowed and shook hands gravely As no remark seemed to be
forthcoming from those who had summoned him he observed that it was
an unpleasant morning This commonplace reminded him of one somewhat
similar that he had made to a supposed Miss Gusty Black and he too
colored

Did you want to speak with me Captain he asked to cover his
confusion

Whywhy I did stammered poor Captain Jerry butbut I
dont knows I do now Then he realized that this was not exactly
complimentary and added That is I dont knowI dont knows
IElsie what was it I was goin to say to Mr Hazeltine

At another time it is likely that the young ladys quick wit would have
helped her out of the difficulty but now she was too much disturbed

Im sure I dont know she said coldly

You dont know Why yes you do Twastwas The Captain was
frantically grasping at straws Why we was wonderin why you didnt
come to see us nowadays

If the Captain had seen the look that Elsie shot at him as he delivered
this brilliant observation he might have been more instead of less
uncomfortable As it was he felt rather proud of having discovered
a way out of the difficulty But Ralphs embarrassment increased He
hurriedly said something about having been very busy

Well went on the Captain intent on making the explanation as
plausible as possible weve missed you considerble We was sayin we
hoped you wouldnt give us up altogether Aint that so Elsie

Miss Prestons foot tapped the sidewalk several times but she answered
though not effusively

Mr Hazeltine is always welcome of course Then she added turning
away Really Captain Jerry I must hurry to school I have a great
deal of work to do before nine oclock Goodmorning Mr Hazeltine

The Captain paused long enough to say Well expect you now so come
and then hurried after her He was feeling very well satisfied with
himself

By mighty Elsie he chuckled I got out of that nice didnt I

He received no answer even when he repeated the remark and although
he endeavored as he swept out the schoolroom to engage the teacher in
conversation her replies were as cold as they were short The Captain
went home in the last stages of dismalness

That afternoon when Captain Eri returned from the fishing grounds
he found Captain Jerry waiting for him at the shanty The humiliated
matchmaker sent Josiah up to the grocery store on an errand and then
dragged his friend inside and shut the door

Captain Eri looked at the woebegone face with some concern

What ails you Jerry he demanded Have youhave you spoken to Mrs
Snow bout thatthat marriage

No I aint Eri but Im in a turrible mess and I dont know why
neither Seems to me the more I try to do for other folks the wuss off I
am and instead of gittin thanks all I git is blame

Why whats the matter

Well now I know youll think Im a fool and ll jest pester the life
out of me See here Eri Hedge If I tell you what I want to will you
promise not to pitch into me and not to nag and poke fun If you dont
promise I wont tell one single word no matter what happens

So Captain Eri promised and then Captain Jerry stammering and
hesitating unburdened his mind of the whole affair telling of his
first reproof by Elsie his explanation to Ralph and the subsequent
developments Long before he finished Captain Eri rose and walking
over to the door stood looking out through the dim pane at the top
while his shoulders shook as if there was a smothered earthquake inside

There exclaimed the injured matrimonial agent in conclusion
Theres the whole fool thing and I most wish Id never seen either of
em I thought I did fustrate this mornin when I was tryin to think
up somethin to show why I hailed Hazeltine but no Elsie wont hardly
speak to me I wish to goodness youd tell me what to do

Captain Eri turned away from the door His eyes were watery and his
face was red but he managed to say

Oh Jerry Jerry Your hearts big as a bucket but fishin s more in
your line than gittin folks married to order is Im fraid You stay
here and unload them fish in the dory There aint many of em and
Josiah ll help when he gits back Im goin out for a few minutes

He went down to the beach climbed into a dory belonging to a neighbor
and Captain Jerry saw him row away in the direction of the cable
station

That evening after the dishes were washed and the table cleared there
came a knock at the door Mrs Snow opened it

Why for goodness sake Mr Hazeltine she exclaimed Come right in
What a stranger you are

Ralph entered shook the snow which had just begun to fall from
his hat and coat took off these articles in response to the hearty
invitation of Captain Eri and shook hands with all present Elsies
face was an interesting study Captain Jerry looked scared

After a few minutes talk Captain Eri rose

Mrs Snow he said come upstairs a little while I want to talk to
you bout somethin You come too Jerry

Captain Jerry looked from Elsie to the speaker and then to Elsie again
But Captain Eris hand was on his arm and he rose and went

Elsie watched this wholesale desertion with amazement Then the door
opened again and Captain Eri put in his head

Elsie he said I jest want to tell you that this is my doins not
Jerrys Thats all And the door shut

Elsie faced the caller with astonishment written on her face

Mr Hazeltine she said icily you may know what this means but I
dont

Ralph looked at her and answered solemnly but with a twinkle in his
eye

Im afraid I can guess Miss Preston You see Captain Jerry paid
Captain Eri a call this afternoon and as a result Captain Eri called
upon me Then as a result of THAT Iwell I came here

The young lady blushed furiously What did Captain Eri tell you she
demanded

Just what Captain Jerry told him

And that was

What you told Captain Jerry this morning concerning something that you
told him before I believe

There was no answer to this Miss Preston looked as if she had a mind
to run out of the room then as if she might cry and finally as if she
wanted to laugh

I humbly apologize said the electrician contritely

YOU apologize For what

For my stupidity in believing that Captain Jerry was to be accepted
seriously

You were excusable certainly And now I must apologize also for
taking the Captain too seriously

Suppose we pair the apologies as they do the votes in the Senate Then
one will offset the other

Im afraid that isnt fair for the blunder was all on my part

Well if we cant pair apologies suppose we pair blunders I dont
accept your statement of guilt mind but since you are determined to
shoulder it we might put it on one side and on the other well put

What

Gusty Black

And then they both laughed

A little later Captain Eri knocked at the door

Is it safe for a feller to come in he asked

Well said Elsie severely I dont know whether talebearers should
be admitted or not but if they do come they must beg pardon for
interfering in other peoples affairs

Maam and the Captain made a profound bow I hope youll be so kind
and condescendin and stoop so low and be so bendin as to forgive
me And while Im bout it Ill apologize for Jerry too

No sir said the young lady decidedly Captain Jerry must apologize
for himself Captain Jeremiah Burgess she called up the stairway
come into court and answer for your sins

And Captain Jerry tremblingly came



CHAPTER XIX

A NOTHEASTER BLOWS


It had begun to snow early in the evening a light fall at first
but growing heavier every minute and as the flakes fell thicker and
faster the wind began to blow and its force increased steadily Ralph
hearing the gusts as they swooped about the corners of the house and
the swish of the snow as it was thrown against the window panes
several times rose to go but Captain Eri in each instance urged him to
stay a little longer Finally the electrician rebelled

I should like to stay Captain he said but how do you think I am
going to get over to the station if this storm grows worse as it seems
to be doing

I dont think was the calm reply Youre goin to stay here

Well I guess not

I guess yes Spose were goin to let you try to row over to the beach
a night like this Its darker n a niggers pocket and blowin and
snowin great guns besides Jest you look out here

He rose beckoned to Ralph and then opened the outer door He had to
use considerable strength to do this and a gust of wind and a small
avalanche of snow roared in and sent the lighter articles flying from
the table Elsie gave a little scream and Mrs Snow exclaimed For the
lands sake shut that door this minute Everything ll be soppin wet

The Captain pulled the door shut again and dropped the hook into the
staple

Nice night for a pull aint it he observed smiling No sir Ive
heard it comin on and I made up my mind youd have to stay on dry land
for a spell no matter if all creation wanted you on tother side

Ralph looked troubled I ought to be at the station he said

Maybe so but you aint and youll have to put up at this boardin
house till mornin When its daylight one of us ll set you across Mr
Langley aint foolish He wont expect you tonight

Now Mr Hazeltine said the housekeeper you might jest as well give
it up fust as last You KNOW you cant go over to that station jest as
well as I do

So Ralph did give it up although rather against his will There was
nothing of importance to be done but he felt a little like a deserter
nevertheless

Perez wont git home neither observed Captain Eri Hes snowed in
too

Captain Perez had that afternoon gone down to the Mayo homestead to take
tea with Miss Davis

Git home I should think not said Mrs Snow decidedly Pashys got
too much sense to let him try it

Well Elsie commented Captain Jerry I told you wed have a
notheaster fore the winter was over I guess therell be gale enough
to satisfy you now No school tomorrer

Well thats settled Lets be comftable Aint there some of that
cider down cellar Wheres the pitcher And Captain Eri hurried off to
find it

When bedtime came there was some argument as to where the guest should
sleep Ralph insisted that the haircloth sofa in the parlor was just the
thing but Captain Eri wouldnt hear of it

Haircloths all right to look at he said but its the slipperiest
stuff that ever was I callate Every time I set on a haircloth chair I
feels if I was draggin anchor

The cot was declared ineligible also and the question was finally
settled by Josiah and Captain Eri going upstairs to the room once
occupied by John Baxter while Ralph took that which they vacated

It was some time before he fell asleep The gale seemed to be tearing
loose the eternal foundations The house shook and the bed trembled
as if a great hand was moving them and the snow slapped against the
windows till it seemed that they must break

In the morning there was little change in the weather The snow had
turned to a sleet half rain that stuck to everything and coated it
with ice The wind was blowing as hard as ever Captain Eri and Ralph
standing just outside the kitchen door and in the lee of the barn
paused to watch the storm for a minute before they went down to the
beach At intervals they caught glimpses of the snowcovered roofs of
the fish shanties and the water of the inner bay black and threatening
and scarred with whitecaps then another gust would come and they could
scarcely see the posts at the yard gate

Think you want to go over do you asked the Captain

I certainly do if I can get there

Oh we can git there all right Ive rowed a dory a good many times
when twas as bad as this This aint no picnic day though thats a
fact he added as they crossed the yard and caught the full force of
the wind Lucky you put on them ileskins

Ralph was arrayed in Captain Jerrys dirtyweather rig and although
as Captain Eri said the garments fitted him like a shirt on a
handspike they were very acceptable

They found the dory covered with snow and halffull of slush and
it took some few minutes to get her into condition When this was
accomplished they hauled her down to the shore and Captain Eri
standing kneedeep in water steadied her while Ralph climbed in Then
the Captain tumbled in himself picked up the oars and settled down for
the pull to the outer beach

A dory as everyone acquainted alongshore knows is the safest of all
small craft for use in heavy weather It is unsinkable for one thing
and being flatbottomed slips over the waves instead of plowing
through them But the high freeboard is a mark for the wind and to keep
a straight course on such a morning as this requires skill and no small
amount of muscle Ralph seated in the stern found himself wondering
how on earth his companion managed to row as he did and steer at the
same time The strokes were short but there was power in them and the
dory although moving rather slowly went doggedly on

Let me take her shouted Ralph after a while you must be tired

Who me Captain Eri laughed I could keep this up for a week There
aint any sea in here If we was outside now twould be diffrent
maybe

They hit the beach almost exactly at the right spot a feat which the
passenger considered a miracle but which the Captain seemed to take
as a matter of course They beached and anchored the dory and bending
almost double as they faced the wind plowed through the sand to the
back door of the station There was comparatively little snow here on
the outer beachthe gale had swept it nearly all away

Mr Langley met them as they tramped into the hall The old gentleman
was glad to see his assistant for he had begun to fear that the latter
might have tried to row over during the evening and met with disaster
As they sat round the stove in his room he said We dont need any
wrecks inside the beach We shall have enough outside Im afraid I
hear there is one schooner in trouble now

That so asked Captain Eri Where is she

On the Hogs Back shoal they think One of the lifesaving crew told
McLaughlin that they saw her last night when the gale first began
trying to make an offing and that wreckage was coming ashore this
morning Captain Davis was going to try to reach her with the boat I
believe

I should like to be at the lifesaving station when they land said
Ralph It would be a new experience for me Ive seen the crew drill
often enough but I have never seen them actually at work

What dyou say if we go down to the station asked the Captain That
is if Mr Langley here can spare you

Oh I can spare him said the superintendent There is nothing of
importance to be done here just now But it will be a terrible walk down
the beach this morning

Wind ll be at our backs and were rigged for it too What dyou say
Mr Hazeltine

Ralph was only too glad of the opportunity to see at least the finish
of a rescuing expedition and he said so So they got into the oilskins
again pulled their souwesters down over their ears and started on
the tramp to the lifesaving station

The electrician is not likely to forget that walk The wind was as
the Captain said at their backs but it whistled in from the sea with
terrific strength and carried the sleet with it It deluged them with
water and plastered them with flying seaweed and ice The wet sand came
in showers like hail and beat against their shoulders until they felt
the sting even through their clothes Toward the bay was nothing but
gray mist streaked with rain and sleet toward the sea was the same
mist flying with the wind over such a huddle of tossing green and white
as Ralph had never seen The surf poured in in rollers that leaped over
each others humped backs in their savage energy to get at the shore
which trembled as they beat upon it The ripples from one wave had not
time to flow back before those of the next came threshing in Great
blobs of foam shot down the strand like wild birds and the gurgle and
splash and roar were terrific

They walked as near the water line as they dared because the sand was
harder there Captain Eri went ahead hands in his pockets and head
down Ralph followed sometimes watching his companion but oftener
gazing at the sea At intervals there would be a lull as if the storm
giant had paused for breath and they could see for half a mile over the
crazy water then the next gust would pull the curtain down again and
a whirl of rain and sleet would shut them in Conversation meant only a
series of shrieks and they gave it up

At length the Captain turned grinned pleasantly while the rain drops
splashed on his nose and waved one arm Ralph looked and saw ahead of
them the clustered buildings of the lifesaving station And he was glad
to see them

Whew puffed Captain Eri as they opened the door Nice mornin for
ducks Hey Luther he shouted wake up here youve got callers

They heard footsteps in the next room the door opened and in camenot
Luther Davis but Captain Perez

Why Eri he exclaimed amazedly

For the lands sake Perez What are you doin here

What are YOU doin here I should say How dyou do Mr Hazeltine

Captain Eri pushed back his souwester and strolled over to the
stove Ralph followed suit

Well Perez said the former extending his hands over the fire its
easy enough to tell you why were here We heard there was a wreck

There is Shes a schooner and shes off there on the Hogs Back
Luther and the crew put off to her more n two hours ago and Im
gittin worried

Then Perez went on to explain that because of the storm he had been
persuaded to stay at Mrs Mayos all night that Captain Davis had
been over for a moment that evening on an errand and had said that the
schooner had been sighted and that as the northeaster was coming on
she was almost certain to get into trouble that he Perez had rowed
over the first thing in the morning to get the news and had been just
in time to see the launching of the lifeboat as the crew put off to the
schooner

There aint nothin to worry bout observed Captain Eri Its no
slouch of a pull off to the Hogs Back this weather and besides Id
trust Lute Davis anywhere on salt water

Yes I know replied the unconvinced Captain Perez but he ought to
have been back afore this There was a kind of letup in the storm jest
afore I got here and they see her fast on the shoal with the crew
in the riggin Luther took the small boat cause he thought he could
handle her better and thats whats worryin me Im fraid shes
overloaded I was jest thinkin of goin out on the pint to see if I
could see anything of em when you folks come

Well go ahead Well go with you if Mr Hazeltines got any of the
chill out of him

Ralph was feeling warm by this time and after Perez had put on his coat
and hat they went out once more into the gale The point of which Perez
had spoken was a wedgeshaped sand ridge that thrown up by the waves
and tide thrust itself out from the beach some few hundred yards below
the station They reached its tip and stood there in the very midst of
the storm waiting for the lulls now more frequent and scanning the
tumbling water for the returning lifeboat

Schooners layin right over there shouted Captain Perez in Ralphs
ear pointing off into the mist Bout a mile off shore I callate
Wicked place the Hogs Back is too

Winds lettin up a little mite bellowed Captain Eri Weve had the
wust of it I guess There aint so much

He did not finish the sentence The curtain of sleet parted leaving a
quartermilelong lane through which they could see the frothing ridges
racing one after the other endlessly And across this lane silent and
swift like a moving picture on a screen drifted a white turtleback
with black dots clinging to it It was in sight not more than a half
minute then the lane closed again as the rain lashed their faces

Captain Perez gasped and clutched the electrician by the arm

Godfrey mighty he exclaimed

What was it shouted Ralph What was it Captain Eri

But Captain Eri did not answer He had turned and was running at full
speed back to the beach When they came up they found him straining at
the side of the dory that Luther Davis used in tending his lobster pots
The boat turned bottom up lay high above tide mark in the little cove
behind the point

Quick now shouted the Captain in a tone Ralph had never heard him
use before Over with her Lively

They obeyed him without question As the dory settled right side up two
heavy oars that had been secured by being thrust under the seats fell
back with a clatter

What was it Captain shouted Ralph

The lifeboat upset How many did you make out hangin onto her Perez
Five seemed to me

Four I thought Eri you aint goin to try to reach her with this
dory You couldnt do it Youll only be drownded yourself My Lord he
moaned wringing his hands what ll Pashy do

Catch aholt now commanded Captain Eri Down to the shore with her
Now

They dragged the dory to the waters edge with one rush Then Eri
hurriedly thrust in the tholepins Perez protested again

Eri he said it aint no use She wont live to git through the
breakers

His friend answered without looking up Do you spose he said that
Im goin to let Lute Davis and them other fellers drown without makin
a try for em Push off when I tell you to

Then you let me go instead of you

Dont talk foolish Youve got Pashy to look after Ready now

But Ralph Hazeltine intervened

Im going myself he said firmly putting one foot over the gunwale
Im a younger man than either of you and Im used to a boat I mean
it Im going

Captain Eri looked at the electricians face he saw nothing but
determination there

Well all go he said suddenly Mr Hazeltine run as fast as the
Lord ll let you back to the station and git another set of oars
Hurry

Without answering the young man sprang up the beach and ran toward the
buildings The moment that he was inside Captain Eri leaped into the
dory

Push off Perez he commanded That young fellers got a life to
live

You dont go without me asserted Perez stoutly

All right Push off and then jump in

Captain Perez attempted to obey He waded into the water and gave the
dory a push but just as he was about to scramble in he received a
shove that sent him backwards

Your jobs takin care of Pashy roared Captain Eri

Perez scrambled to his feet but the dory was already halfway across
the little patch of comparatively smooth water in the cove As he looked
he saw it enter the first line of breakers rise amid a shower of foam
poise on the crest and slip over The second line of roaring waves
came surging on higher and more threatening than the first Captain Eri
glanced over his shoulder turned the dorys bow toward them and
waited They broke and as they did so the boat shot forward into the
whirlpool of froth Then the sleet came pouring down and shut everything
from sight

When Ralph came hurrying to the beach bearing the oars he found
Captain Perez alone



CHAPTER XX

ERI GOES BACK ON A FRIEND


Captain Eri knew that the hardest and most dangerous portion of his
perilous trip was just at its beginning If the dory got through
the surf without capsizing it was an even bet that she would stay
rightsideup for a while longer at any rate So he pulled out of the
little cove and pointed the boats bow toward the thundering smother
of white his shoulders squared his hands tightened on the oar handles
and his underjaw pushed out beyond the upper Old foremast hands those
who had sailed with the Captain on his coasting voyages would had they
seen these signs have prophesied trouble for someone They were Captain
Eris battleflags and just now his opponent was the gray Atlantic If
the latter won it would only be after a fight

The first wave tripped over the bar and whirled beneath him sending
the dory high into the air and splashing its occupant with spray The
Captain held the boat stationary waiting for the second to break and
then half rising put all his weight and strength on the oars The
struggle had begun

They used to say on board the Hannah M that the skipper never got
rattled The same cool head and steady nerve that Josiah had admired
when the catboat threaded the breakers at the entrance of the bay now
served the same purpose in this more tangled and infinitely more wicked
maze The dory climbed and ducked rolled and slid but gained inch by
inch foot by foot The advancing waves struck savage blows at the
bow the wind did its best to swing her broadside on but there was one
hundred and eighty pounds of clear grit and muscle tugging at the oars
and though the muscles were not as young as they had been there were
years of experience to make every pound count At last the preliminary
round was over The boat sprang clear of the breakers and crept out
farther and farther with six inches of water slopping in her bottom
but afloat and seaworthy

It was not until she was far into deep water that the Captain turned
her bow down the shore When this was done it was on the instant and
although a little more water came inboard there was not enough to be
dangerous Then with the gale astern and the tide to help Captain
Eri made the dory go as she or any other on that coast had never gone
before

The Captain knew that the wind and the tide that were now aiding him
were also sweeping the overturned lifeboat along at a rapid rate He
must come up with it before it reached the next shoal He must reach
it before the waves and worse than all the cold had caused the poor
fellows clinging to it for life to loose their grip

The dory jumped from crest to crest like a hurdler The sleet now beat
directly into the Captains face and froze on his eyebrows and lashes
but he dared not draw in an oar to free a hand The wind caught up the
spindrift and poured it over him in icy baths but he was too warm from
the furious exercise to mind

In the lulls he turned his head and gazed over the sea looking for the
boat Once he saw it before the storm shut down again and he groaned
aloud to count but two black dots on its white surface He pulled harder
than ever and grunted with every stroke while the perspiration poured
down his forehead and froze when it reached the ice dams over his eyes

At last it was in plain sight and the two dots now clearly human
beings were still there He pointed the bow straight at it and rowed
on When he looked again there was but one a figure sprawled along the
keel clinging to the centerboard

The flying dory bore down upon the lifeboat and the Captain risked what
little breath he had in a hail The clinging figure raised its head and
Captain Eri felt an almost selfish sense of relief to see that it was
Luther Davis If it had to be but one he would rather it was that one

The bottom of the lifeboat rose like a dome from the sea that beat and
roared over and around it The centerboard had floated up and projected
at the top and it was about this that Captain Davis arms were clasped
Captain Eri shot the dory alongside pulled in one oar and the two
boats fitted closely together Then Eri reached out and seizing his
friend by the belt round his waist pulled him from his hold Davis fell
into the bottom of the dory only half conscious and entirely helpless

Captain Eri lifted him so that his head and shoulders rested on a
thwart and then setting his oar against the lifeboats side pushed
the dory clear Then he began rowing again

So far he had been more successful than he had reason to expect but the
task that he must now accomplish was not less difficult He must reach
the shore safely and with another life beside his own to guard

It was out of the question to attempt to get back to the cove the
landing must be made on the open beach and although Captain Eri had
more than once brought a dory safely through a high surf he had never
attempted it when his boat had nearly a foot of water in her and carried
a helpless passenger

Little by little still running before the wind the Captain edged in
toward the shore Luther Davis moved once or twice but said nothing
His oilskins were frozen stiff and his beard was a lump of ice Captain
Eri began to fear that he might die from cold and exhaustion before the
attempt at landing was made The Captain resolved to wait no longer but
to take the risk of running directly for the beach

He was near enough now to see the leaping spray of the breakers and
their bellow sounded louder than the howl of the wind or the noises
of the sea about him He bent forward and shouted in the ear of the
prostrate lifesaver

Luther he yelled Lute

Captain Davis head rolled back his eyes opened and in a dazed way
he looked at the figure swinging back and forth with the oars

Lute shouted Captain Eri listen to me Im goin to try to land
Dyou hear me

Davis thoughts seemed to be gathering slowly He was ordinarily a man
of strong physique courageous and a fighter every inch of him but his
strength had been beaten out by the waves and chilled by the cold
and the sight of the men with whom he had lived and worked for years
drowning one by one had broken his nerve He looked at his friend and
then at the waves

Whats the use he said feebly Theyre all gone I might as well go
too

Captain Eris eyes snapped Lute Davis he exclaimed I never thought
Id see you playin crybaby Brace up What are you anyway

The halffrozen man made a plucky effort

All right Eri he said Im with you but I aint much good

Can you stand up

I dont know Ill try

Little by little he raised himself to his knees

Bout as furs I can go Eri he said between his teeth You look
out for yourself Ill do my durndest

The dory was caught by the first of the great waves and on its crest
went flying toward the beach Captain Eri steered it with the oars as
well as he could The wave broke and the halffilled boat paused
was caught up by the succeeding breaker and thrown forward again The
Captain still trying to steer with one oar let go of the other and
seizing his companion by the belt pulled him to his feet

Now then he shouted stand by

The boat poised on the curling wave went down like a hammer struck the
sand and was buried in water Just as it struck Captain Eri jumped as
far shoreward as he could Davis sprang with him but it was really the
Captains strength that carried them clear of the rail

They kept their feet for an instant but in that instant Captain Eri
dragged his friend a yard or so up the shelving beach Then they were
knocked flat by the next wave The Captain dug his toes into the sand
and braced himself as the undertow sucked back Once more he rose and
they staggered on again only to go down when the next rush of water
came Three times this performance was repeated and as they rose for
the fourth time the Captain roared Now

Another plunge a splashing run and they were on the hard sand of
the beach Then they both tumbled on their faces and breathed in great
gasps

But the Captain realized that this would not do for in their soaked
condition freezing to death was a matter of but a short time He seized
Davis by the shoulder and shook him again and again

Come on Lute Come on he insisted Git up Youve GOT to git up

And after a while the lifesaver did get up although he could
scarcely stand Then with the Captains arm around his waist they
started slowly up the beach toward the station

They had gone but a little way when they were met by Ralph Hazeltine and
Captain Perez


Mrs Snow had been for her rather nervous all that forenoon She
performed her household duties as thoroughly as usual but Elsie to
whom the storm had brought a holiday noticed that she looked out of the
window and at the clock frequently Once she even went so far as to tell
the young lady that she felt kind of queer jest as if somethin was
goin to happen As the housekeeper was not the kind to be troubled
with presentiments Elsie was surprised

Dinner was on the table at twelve oclock but Captain Eri was not there
to help eat it and they sat down without him And here again Mrs Snow
departed from her regular habit for she ate little and was very quiet
She was the first to hear an unusual sound outside and jumping up ran
to the window

Somebodys drivin into the yard she said Who on airth would be
comin here such a day as this

Captain Jerry joined her at the window

Its Abner Mayos horse he said Maybe its Perez comin home

It was not Captain Perez but Mr Mayo himself as they saw when the
rubber blanket fastened across the front of the buggy was dropped and
the driver sprang out Mrs Snow opened the door for him

Hello Abner exclaimed Captain Jerry as the newcomer stopped to
knock the snow from his boots before coming in what have you done to
Perez Goin to keep him for a steady boarder

But Mr Mayo had important news to communicate and he did not intend
to lose the effect of his sensation by springing it without due
preparation He took off his hat and mittens and solemnly declined a
proffered chair

Capn Burgess he said Ive got somethin to tell yousomethin
awful The whole lifesavin crew but one is drownded and Capn Eri
Hedge

An exclamation from Mrs Snow interrupted him The housekeeper clasped
her hands together tightly and sank into a chair She was very white
Elsie ran to her

What is it Mrs Snow she asked

Nothin nothin Go on Mr Mayo Go on

The bearer of illtidings gratified at the result of his first attempt
proceeded deliberately

And Capn Hedge and Luther Davis are over at the station pretty nigh
dead If it want for the Capn Lutherd have gone too Eri took a
dory and went off and picked him up Perez come over to my house and
told us about it and Pashys gone back with him to see to her brother
I didnt go down to the store this mornin twas stormin so but as
soon as I heard I harnessed up to come and tell you

Then in answer to the hurried questions of Captain Jerry and Elsie Mr
Mayo told the whole story as far as he knew it Mrs Snow said nothing
but sat with her hands still clasped in her lap

Luther is haf drownded and froze concluded Abner and the Capn
got a bang with an oar when they jumped out of the dory that Perez
is afraid broke his arm Im goin right back to git Dr Palmer They
tried to telephone him but the wires down

Dear dear dear exclaimed Captain Jerry completely demoralized by
the news Thats dreadful I must go right down there mustnt I The
poor fellers

Mrs Snow rose to her feet quietly but with a determined air

Are you goin right back soons youve got the Doctor Mr Mayo she
asked

Why no I want I aint been to my store this mornin and Im
fraid I ought to be there

To be frank Abner was too great a sensation lover to forfeit the
opportunity of springing his startling news on the community

Then Josiah youll have to harness Danl and take me down I mustnt
wait another minute

Why Mrs Snow expostulated Captain Jerry you mustnt go down
there The Doctors goin and Ill go and Pashys there already

But the housekeeper merely waved him aside

I want you to stay here with Elsie she said Theres no tellin how
long I may be gone Josiah ll drive me down wont you Josiah

There was no lack of enthusiasm in the able seamans answer The boy
was only too glad of the chance

But it aint fit weather for you to be out in Youll git soakin wet

I guess if Pashy Davis can stand it I can Elsie will you come and
help me git ready while Josiahs harnessin

As they entered the chamber above Elsie was thunderstruck to see her
companion seat herself in the rocker and cover her face with her hands
If it had been anyone else it would not have been so astonishing but
the cool selfpossessed housekeepershe could scarcely believe it

Why Mrs Snow she exclaimed what IS it

The lady from Nantucket hastily rose and wiped her eyes with her apron

Oh nothin she answered with an attempt at a smile Im kind of
fidgety this mornin and the way that man started off to tell his yarn
upset me thats all I mustnt be such a fool

She set about getting ready with a vim and attention to detail that
proved that her fidgets had not affected her commonsense She was
pale and her hands trembled a little but she took a covered basket and
packed in it cloth for bandages a hotwater bottle mustard a bottle
of liniment and numerous other things likely to be of use Last of all
she added a bottle of whisky that had been prescribed as a stimulant for
John Baxter

I spose some folks would think twas terrible carryin this with me
she observed A woman pitched into me once for givin it to her husband
when he was sick I told her I didnt favor RHUBARB as a steady drink
but I hoped I knew enough to give it when twas necessary

Ralph and Captain Perez were surprised men when the housekeeper
dripping but cheerful appeared on the scene She and Josiah had had a
stormy passage on the way down for the easygoing Daniel had objected
to being asked to trot through drifts and Mrs Snow had insisted that
he should be made to do it The ford was out of the question so they
stalled the old horse in the Mayo barn and borrowed Abners dory to make
the crossing

Mrs Snow took charge at once of the tired men and the overtaxed Miss
Patience was glad enough to have her do it Luther Davis was in bed
and Captain Eri after an hours sojourn in the same snug harbor
had utterly refused to stay there longer and now dressed in a suit
belonging to the commandant was stretched upon a sofa in the front
room

The Captain was the most surprised of all when Mrs Snow appeared He
fairly gasped when she first entered the room and seemed to be struck
speechless for he said scarcely a word while she dosed him with hot
drinks rubbed his shoulderthe bone was not broken but there was
a bruise there as big as a saucerwith the liniment and made him
generally comfortable He watched her every movement with a sort of
worshipful wonder and seemed to be thinking hard

Captain Davis although feeling a little better was still very weak
and his sister and Captain Perez were with him Josiah soon returned
to the Mayo homestead to act as ferryman for Dr Palmer when the latter
should arrive and Ralph finding that there was nothing more that he
could do went back to the cable station The storm had abated somewhat
and the wind had gone down Captain Eri and Mrs Snow were alone in the
front room and for the first time since she entered the house the
lady from Nantucket sat down to rest Then the Captain spoke

Mrs Snow he said gravely I dont believe youve changed your
clothes sence you got here You must have been soaked through too I
wish you wouldnt take such risks You hadnt ought to have come over
here a day like this anyway Not but what the Lord knows its good to
have you here he added hastily

The housekeeper seemed surprised

Capn Eri she said I blieve if you was dyin youd worry for fear
somebody else wouldnt be comftable while you was doing it Twould
be pretty hard for me to change my clothes she added with a laugh
seein that there probably aint anything but mens clothes in the
place Then with a sigh Poor fellers they wont need em any more

Thats so And they were all alive and hearty this mornin Its an
awful thing for Luther Has he told anything yit bout how it come to
happen

Yes a little The schooner was from Maine bound to New York Besides
her own crew she had some Italians aboard coalhandlers they was
goin over on a job for the owner Capn Davis says he saw right away
that the lifeboat would be overloaded but he had to take em all
there want time for a second trip He made the schooners crew and the
others lay down in the boat where they wouldnt hinder the men at the
oars but when they got jest at the tail of the shoal where the sea was
heaviest them Italians lost their heads and commenced to stand up and
yell and fust thing you know she swung broadside on and capsized
Pashy says Luther dont say much more but she jedges from what he does
say that some of the men hung on with him for a while but was washed
off and drownded

Thats right there was four or five there when we saw her fust
Twas Lutes grip on the centerboard that saved him Its an awful
thingawful

Yes and he would have gone too if it hadnt been for you And you
talk about MY takin risks

Well Jerry hadnt ought to have let you come

LET me come I should like to have seen him try to stop me The idea
Where would I be if twant helpin you after all youve done for me

IVE done I havent done anything

Youve made me happier n Ive been for years Youve been so kind
thatthat

She stopped and looked out of the window

Its you thats been kind said the Captain Youve made a home for
me somethin I aint had afore sence I was a boy

Mrs Snow went on as if he had not spoken

And to think that you might have been drownded the same as the rest
she said I knew somethin was happenin I jest felt it somehow I
told Elsie I was sure of it I couldnt think of anything but you all
the forenoon

The Captain sat up on the couch

Marthy he said in an awed tone do you know what I was thinkin of
when I was pullin through the wust of it this mornin I was thinkin
of you I thought of Luther and the rest of them poor souls of course
but I thought of you most of the time It kept comin back to me that if
I went under I shouldnt see you agin And you was thinkin of me

Yes when that Mayo man said he had awful news I felt sure twas you
he was goin to tell about I never fainted away in my life that I know
of but I think I most fainted then

And you cared as much as that

Yes

Somehow both were speaking quietly but as if it was useless longer to
keep back anything To speak the exact truth without reserve seemed the
most natural thing in the world

Well well well said the Captain reverently and still in the same
low tone I said once afore that I blieved you was sent here and now
Im sure of it It seems almost as if you was sent to ME dont it

The housekeeper still looked out of the window but she answered simply
I dont know

It does it does so Marthy weve been happy together while youve
been here Do you blieve you could be happy with me alwaysif you
married me I mean

Mrs Snow turned and looked at him There were tears in her eyes but
she did not wipe them away

Yes she said

Think now Marthy I aint very young and I aint very rich

What am I with a little smile

And you really think you could be happy if you was the wife of an old
codger like me

Yes The answer was short but it was convincing

Captain Eri rose to his feet

Gosh he said in a sort of unbelieving whisper Marthy are you
willin to try

And again Mrs Snow said Yes


When Dr Palmer came he found Luther Davis still in bed but Captain Eri
was up and dressed and there was such a quiet air of happiness about
him that the man of medicine was amazed

Good Lord man he exclaimed I expected to find you flat on your
back and you look better than Ive seen you for years Taking a
saltwater bath in midwinter must agree with you

It aint so much that replied the Captain serenely Its the pay I
got for takin it

When the Doctor saw Perez alone he asked the latter to keep a close
watch on Captain Eris behavior He said he was afraid that the exertion
and exposure might have affected the Captains brain

Perez alarmed by this caution did watch his friend very closely but
he saw nothing to frighten him until as they were about to start for
home Captain Eri suddenly struck his thigh a resounding slap

Jerry he groaned distressfully I clean forgot Ive gone back on
Jerry



CHAPTER XXI

DIMESHOW BUSNESS


Elsie and Captain Jerry were kept busy that afternoon Abner Mayos news
spread quickly and people gathered at the postoffice the stores and
the billiard room to discuss it Some of the men notably Cy Warner
and Rufe Smith local representatives of the big Boston dailies
hurried off to the lifesaving station to get the facts at first hand
Others came down to talk with Captain Jerry and Elsie Melissa Busteeds
shawl was on her shoulders and her cloud was tied about her head in
less than two minutes after her nextdoor neighbor shouted the story
across the back yards She had just left the house and Captain Jerry
was delivering a sarcastic speech concerning talkin machines when
Daniel plodded through the gate drawing the buggy containing Josiah
Mrs Snow and Captain Eri

For a man who had been described as halfdead Captain Eri looked very
well indeed Jerry ran to help him from the carriage but he jumped out
himself and then assisted the housekeeper to alight with an air of proud
proprietorship He was welcomed to the house like a returned prodigal
and Captain Jerry shook his well hand until the arm belonging to it
seemed likely to become as stiff and sore as the other While this
handshaking was going on Captain Eri was embarrassed He did not look
his friend in the face and most of his conversation was addressed to
Elsie

As soon as he had warmed his hands and told the story of the wreck and
rescue he said Jerry come up to my room a minute wont you Ive
got somethin I want to say

Vaguely wondering what the private conversation might be Jerry followed
his friend upstairs When they were in the room Captain Eri closed the
door and faced his companion He was confused and stammered a little
as he said Jerry IveIve got somethin to say to you bout Mrs
Snow

Then it was Captain Jerrys turn to be confused

Now Eri he protested taint fair to keep pesterin me like this
I know I aint said nothin to her yit but Im goin to I had a week
anyhow and it aint haf over Land sake he burst forth dyou
spose I aint been thinkin bout it I aint thought of nothin else
hardly I bet you Ive been over the whole thing every night sence we
had that talk I go over it and GO over it Ive thought of more n a
million ways to ask her but there aint one of em that suits me If I
was goin to be hung twouldnt be no worse and now youve got to keep
anaggin Let me alone till my time is up cant you

I want naggin I was jest goin to tell you that you wont have to
ask Ive been talkin to her myself and

The sacrifice sprang out of his chair

Eri Hedge he exclaimed indignantly I thought you was a friend of
mine I give you my word Id do it in a week and the least you could
have done seems to me would have been to wait and give me the chance
But no all you think bouts yourself So fraid shed say no and youd
lose your old housekeeper want you The idea She must think Im a
good onecant do my own courtin and have to git somebody to do it
for me What did she say he asked suddenly

She said yes to what I asked her was the reply with a half smile

Upon Captain Jerrys face settled the look of one who accepts the
melancholy inevitable He sat down again

I sposed she would he said with a sigh Shes known me for quite a
spell now and shes had a chance to see what kind of a man I be Well
what else did you do Aint settled the weddin day have you This
with marked sarcasm

Not yit Jerry youve made a mistake I didnt ask her for you

Didnt ask herdidntWhat are you talkin bout then

I asked her for myself Shes goin to marry me

Captain Jerry was too much astonished even to get up Instead he simply
sat still with open mouth while his friend continued

Ive come to think a lot of Mrs Snow sence shes been here Captain
Eri said slowly and Ive found out that shes felt the same way bout
me Ive kept still and said nothin cause I thought you ought to have
the fust chance and besides I didnt know how she felt But today
while we was talkin it all come out of itself seems so andwell
were goin to be married

The sacrificea sacrifice no longerstill sat silent but curious
changes of expression were passing over his face Surprise amazement
relief and now a sort of grieved resignation

I feel small enough bout the way Ive treated you Jerry continued
Captain Eri I didnt mean tobut there its done and all I can
do is say Im sorry and that I meant to give you your chance I shant
blame you if you git mad not a bit but I hope you wont

Captain Jerry sighed When he spoke it was in a tone of sublime
forgiveness

Eri he said I aint mad I wont say my feelins aint hurt
causecausewell never mind If a wife and a home aint for me why
I ought to be glad that youre goin to have em I wish you both luck
and a good vyage Now dont talk to me for a few minutes Let me git
sort of used to it

So they shook hands and Captain Eri with a troubled look at his friend
went out After he had gone Captain Jerry got up and danced three steps
of an improvised jig his face one broad grin Then with an effort he
sobered down assumed an air of due solemnity and tramped downstairs

If the announcement of Captain Perez engagement caused no surprise
that of Captain Eris certainly didsurprise and congratulation on the
part of those let into the secret for it was decided to say nothing to
outsiders as yet Ralph came over that evening and they told him about
it and he was as pleased as the rest As for the Captain he was only
too willing to shake hands with any and everybody although he insisted
that the housekeeper had nothing to be congratulated upon and that she
was takin big chances The lady herself merely smiled at this and
quietly said that she was willing to take them

The storm had wrecked every wire and stalled every train and Orham was
isolated for two days Then communication was established once more and
the Boston dailies received the news of the loss of the lifesavers
and the crew of the schooner And they made the most of it sensational
items were scarce just then and the editors welcomed this one The
big black headlines spread halfway across the front pages There were
pictures of the wreck drawn by our artist from description and
there were descriptions of all kinds Special reporters arrived in
the village and interviewed everyone they could lay hands on Abner Mayo
felt that for once he was receiving the attention he deserved

The lifesaving station and the house by the shore were besieged by
photographers and newspaper men Captain Eri indignantly refused to pose
for his photograph so he was snapped as he went out to the barn and
had the pleasure of seeing a likeness of himself somewhat out of focus
and with one leg stiffly elevated in the Sunday Blanket The reporters
waylaid him at the postoffice or at his fish shanty and begged for
interviews They got them brief and pointedly personal and though
these were not printed columns describing him as a bluff bighearted
hero were

If ever a man was mad and disgusted that man was the Captain In the
first place as he said what he had done was nothing more than any
other man longshore would have done and secondly it was nobodys
business Then again he said and with truth

This whole fuss makes me sick Heres them fellers in the crew been
goin out season after season takin folks off wrecks and the fool
papers never say nothin bout it but they go out this time and dont
save nobody and git drownded themselves and theyre heroes of a sudden
I hear theyre raisin money up to Boston to give to the widders and
orphans Well thats all right but theyd better keep on and git the
Govment to raise the salries of them thats left in the service

The climax came when a flashily dressed stranger called and insisted
upon seeing the Captain alone The interview lasted just about three
minutes When Mrs Snow alarmed by the commotion rushed into the room
she found Captain Eri in the act of throwing after the fleeing stranger
the shiny silk hat that the latter had left behind

Do you know what thatthat swab wanted hotly demanded the indignant
Captain He wanted me to rig up in ileskins and a souwester and show
myself in dime museums Said hed buy that dory of Luthers that I went
out in and show that long with me I told him that dory was spread up
and down the beach from here to Setuckit but he said that didnt
make no diffrence hed have a dory there and say twas the reel one
Offered me a hundred dollars a week the skate Id give ten dollars
right now to tell him the rest of what I had to say

After this the Captain went fishing every day and when at home refused
to see anybody not known personally But the agitation went on for the
papers fed the flames and in Boston they were raising a purse to buy
gold watches and medals for him and for Captain Davis

Shortly after four oclock one afternoon of the week following that of
the wreck Captain Eri ventured to walk up to the village keeping a
weather eye out for reporters and smoking his pipe He made several
stops one of them being at the schoolhouse where Josiah now back at
his desk was studying overtime to catch up with his class

As the Captain was strolling along someone touched him from behind
and he turned to face Ralph Hazeltine The electrician had been a pretty
regular caller at the house of late but Captain Eri had seen but little
of him for reasons unnecessary to state

Hello Captain said Ralph Taking a constitutional You want to look
out for Warner I hear hes after you for another rescue special

Hell need somebody to rescue him if he comes pesterin round me was
the reply You aint seen my dime show friend nowheres have you
Id sort of like to meet HIM again our other talk broke off kind of
sudden

Ralph laughed and said he was afraid that the museum manager wouldnt
come to Orham again very soon

I spose likely not chuckled Captain Eri I ought to have kept his
hat then maybe hed have come back after it Oh say he added
Ive been meanin to ask you somethin Made up your mind bout that
western job yit

Ralph shook his head Not yet he said slowly I shall very soon
though I think

Kind of puzzlin you is it Not that its really any of my affairs
you understand Theres only a few of us good folks left as the feller
said and Id hate to see you leave thats all

I am not anxious to go myself My present position gives me a good
deal of leisure time for experimental workandwell Ill tell you in
confidencetheres a possibility of my becoming superintendent one of
these days if I wish to

Sho you dont say Mr Langley goin to quit

He is thinking of it The old gentleman has saved some money and he
has a sister in the West who is anxious to have him come out there and
spend the remainder of his days with her If he does I can have his
position I guess In fact he has been good enough to say so

Well thats pretty fine aint it Langley aint the man to chuck his
good opinions round like clam shells You ought to feel proud

I suppose I ought

They walked on silently for a few steps the Captain waiting for his
companion to speak and the latter seeming disinclined to do so At
length the older man asked another question

Is tother job so much better

No

Silence again Then Ralph said The other position Captain is very
much like this one in some respects It will place me in a country
town even smaller than Orham where there are few young people no
amusements and no society in the fashionable sense of the word

Humph I thought you didnt care much for them things

I dont

To this enigmatical answer the Captain made no immediate reply After
a moment however he said slowly and with apparent irrelevance Mr
Hazeltine I can remember my father tellin bout a feller that lived
down on the South Harniss shore when he was a boy Queer old chap he
was named Elihu Bassett everybody called him Uncle Elihu In them days
all hands drunk more or less rum and Uncle Elihu drunk more He had
a way of stayin sober for a spell and then startin off on a regular
jamboree all by himself He had an old flatbottomed boat that he used
to sail round in but she broke her moorins one time and got smashed
up so he wanted to buy another Shadrach Wingate Seths granddad
twas tried to fix up a dicker with him for a boat he had They agreed
on the price and everything was all right cept that Uncle Elihu stuck
out that he must try her fore he bought her

So Shad finlly give in and Uncle Elihu sailed over to Wellmouth in
the boat He put in his time round the tavern there and when he come
down to the boat agin he had a jugful of Medford in his hand and
pretty nigh as much of the same stuff under his hatches He got afloat
somehow histed the sail lashed the tiller after a fashion took a
nip out of the jug and tumbled over and went fast asleep Twas a still
night or twould have been the finish As twas he run aground on a flat
and stuck there till mornin

Next day back he comes with the boat all scraped up and says he She
wont do Shad she dont keep her course

Dont keep her course you old fool bellers Shad And you tight as
a drumhead and sound asleep Think she can find her way home herself
he says

Well says Uncle Elihu if she cant she aint the boat for me

Ralph laughed I see he said Perhaps Uncle Elihu was wise Still
if he wanted the boat very much he must have hated to put her to the
test

Thats so assented the Captain but twas better to know it then
than to be sorry for it afterwards

Both seemed to be thinking and neither spoke again until they came to
the grocery store where Hazeltine stopped saying that he must do an
errand for Mr Langley They said goodnight and the Captain turned
away but came quickly back and said

Mr Hazeltine if it aint too much trouble would you mind steppin
up to the schoolhouse when youve done your errand Ive left somethin
there with Josiah and Id like to have you git it Will you

Certainly was the reply and it was not until the Captain had gone
that Ralph remembered he did not know what he was to get

When he reached the school he climbed the stairs and opened the door
expecting to find Josiah alone Instead there was no one there but
Elsie who was sitting at the desk She sprang up as he entered Both
were somewhat confused

Pardon me Miss Preston he said Captain Eri sent me here He said
he left something with Josiah and wished me to call for it

Why Im sure I dont know what it can be replied Elsie Josiah has
been gone for some time and he said nothing to me about it

Perhaps it is in his desk suggested Ralph Suppose we look

So they looked but found nothing more than the usual assortment
contained in the desk of a healthy schoolboy The raised lid shut off
the light from the window and the desks interior was rather dark They
had to grope in the corners and occasionally their hands touched Every
time this happened Ralph thought of the decision that he must make so
soon

He thought of it still more when after the search was abandoned Elsie
suggested that he help her with some problems that she was preparing for
the next days labors of the first class in arithmetic In fact as he
sat beside her pretending to figure but really watching her dainty
profile as it moved back and forth before his eyes his own particular
problem received far more attention than did those of the class
Suddenly he spoke

Teacher he said please may I ask a question

You should hold up your hand if you wish permission to speak was the
stern reply

Please consider it held up

Is the question as important as How many bushels did C sell which
happens to be my particular trouble just now

It is to me certainly Ralph was serious enough now It is a
question that I have been wrestling with for some time It is shall I
take the position that has been offered me in the West or shall I stay
here and become superintendent of the station The superintendents
place may be mine I think if I want it

Elsie laid down her pencil and hesitated for a moment before she spoke
When she did reply her face was turned away from her companion

I should think that question might best be decided by comparing the
salaries and prospects of the two positions she said quietly

The two positions are much alike in one way You know what the life at
the station means the greater portion of the yearno companions of
your own age and condition no society no amusements The Western offer
means all this and worse for the situation is the same all the year I
say these things because I hope you may be willing to consider them not
from my point of view solely but from yours

From mine

Yes You see I am recklessly daring to hope that whichever lot is
chosen you may be willing to share it with meas my wife Elsie do
you think you could consider the question from that viewpoint

AndwellElsie thought she could

The considerationwe suppose it was the considerationtook so long
that it was nearly dark when Elsie announced that she simply MUST go It
was Ralphs duty as a gentleman to help her in putting on her coat and
this took an astonishingly long time Finally it was done however and
they came downstairs

Dearest said Ralph after the door was locked I forgot to have
another hunt for whatever it was that Captain Eri wanted me to get

Elsie smiled rather oddly

Are you sure you havent got it she asked demurely

Got it Whywhy by George what a numbskull I am The old rascal I
thought there was a twinkle in his eye

He said he should come back after me

Well well Bless his heart its sound and sweet all the way through
Yes I HAVE got it and whats more I shall tell him that I mean to
keep it


The gold watches from the people to the heroes of the Orham wreck having
been duly bought and inscribed and the medals struck there came up the
question of presentation and it was decided to perform the ceremony in
the Orham town hall and to make the occasion notable The Congressman
from the district agreed to make the necessary speech The Harniss
Cornet Band was to furnish music All preparations were made and it
remained only to secure the consent of the parties most interested
namely Captain Eri and Luther Davis

And this was the hardest task of all Both men at first flatly refused
to be present The Captain said he might as well go to the dime museum
and be done with it he was much obliged to the Boston folks but his
own watch was keeping good time and he didnt need a new one badly
enough to make a show of himself to get it Captain Davis said very much
the same

But Miss Patience was proud of her brothers rise to fame and didnt
intend to let him forfeit the crowning glory She enlisted Captain Perez
as a supporter and together they finally got Luthers unwilling consent
to sit on the platform and be stared at for one evening Meanwhile
Captain Jerry Elsie Ralph and Mrs Snow were doing their best to win
Captain Eri over When Luther surrendered the forces joined and the
Captain threw up his hands

All right he said Only I ought to beg that dime museum fellers
pardon Taint right to be partial this way


The hall was jammed to the doors Captain Eri seated on the platform
at one end of the halfcircle of selectmen local politicians and minor
celebrities looked from the Congressman in the middle to Luther on the
other end and then out over the crowded settees He saw Mrs Snows
pleasant wholesome face beaming proudly beside Captain Jerrys red one
He saw Captain Perez and Miss Patience sitting together close to the
front and Ralph and Elsie a little further back The Reverend Mr
Perley was there so were the Smalls and Miss Abigail Mullett Melissa
Busteed was on the very front bench with the boys of whom Josiah was
one The train committee was therenot a member missingand at the
rear of the hall smiling and unctuous as ever was Web Saunders In
spite of his stage fright the Captain grinned when he saw Web

Mr Solomon Bangs his shirtbosom crackling with importance introduced
the Congressman The latters address was so the Item said a triumph
of oratorical effort It really was a good speech and when it touched
upon the simple sacrifice of the men who had given up their lives in the
course of what to them was everyday work there were stifled sobs all
through the hall Luther Davis during this portion of the address
sat with his big hand shading his eyes Later on when the speaker was
sounding the praises of the man who alone forgetful of himself braved
the sea and the storm to save his friends those who looked at Captain
Eri saw his chair hitched back inch by inch until as the final
outburst came little more than his Sunday shoes was in sight He had
retired chair and all to the wings

But they called him to the platform again and amidwe quote from the
Item once morea hurricane of applause the two heroes were adorned
with the watches and the medals

There was a sort of impromptu reception after the ceremony when Captain
Eri with Mrs Snow on his arm struggled through the crowd toward the
door

Twas great shipmate and you deserved it declared magnanimous
Captain Jerry wringing his hand

Taint haf what you ought to have Eri said Captain Perez

I havent said much to thank you for savin Luther whispered Miss
Patience but I hope you know that we both appreciate what you done and
never ll forgit it

Ralph and Elsie also shook hands with him and said some pleasant
things So did many others Dr Palmer among the number Altogether the
journey through the hall was a sort of triumphal progress

Whew gasped the Captain as they came out into the clear air and the
moonlight lets hope thats the last of the dimeshow busness

Eri whispered Mrs Snow Im so proud of you I dont know what to
do

And that remark was sweeter to the Captains ears than all those that
had preceded it

They turned into the shore road and were alone It was a clear winter
night fresh white snow on the ground not a breath of wind and the
full moon painting land and sea dark blue and silver white The surf
sounded faint and far off Somewhere in the distance a dog was barking
and through the stillness came an occasional laugh or shout from the
people going home from the hall

Lots of things can happen in a few months cant they said Mrs Snow
glancing at the black shadow of the shuttered Baxter homestead

They can so replied the Captain Think whats happened sence last
September I didnt know you then and now it seems s if Id always
known you John was alive then and Elsie nor Ralph hadnt come Perez
hadnt met Pashy neither My my Everybodys choosed partners but
Jerry he chuckled and Jerry looked the most likely candidate long
at the beginnin Im glad he added that Ralphs made up his mind to
stay here We shant lose him nor Elsie for a few years anyhow

They paused at the knoll by the gate

Fair day tomorrer observed the Captain looking up at the sky

I hope it ll be fair weather for us the rest of our days said Mrs
Snow

Youve HAD it rough enough thats sure Well I hope youll have a
smooth vyage now

The lady from Nantucket looked up into his face with a happy laugh

I guess I shall she said I know Ive got a good pilot
