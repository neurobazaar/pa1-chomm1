FIVE LITTLE PEPPERS




A HOME VIEW


The little old kitchen had quieted down from the bustle and confusion
of midday and now with its afternoon manners on presented a holiday
aspect that as the principal room in the brown house it was eminently
proper it should have It was just on the edge of the twilight and the
little Peppers all except Ben the oldest of the flock were enjoying
a breathing spell as their mother called it which meant some
quiet work suitable for the hour All the breathing spell they could
remember however poor things for times were always hard with them
nowadays and since the father died when Phronsie was a baby Mrs
Pepper had had hard work to scrape together money enough to put bread
into her childrens mouths and to pay the rent of the little brown
house

But she had met life too bravely to be beaten down now So with a stout
heart and a cheery face she had worked away day after day at making
coats and tailoring and mending of all descriptions and she had seen
with pride that couldnt be concealed her noisy happy brood growing
up around her and filling her heart with comfort and making the little
brown house fairly ring with jollity and fun

Poor things she would say to herself they havent had any bringing
up theyve just scrambled up And then she would set her lips together
tightly and fly at her work faster than ever I must get schooling for
them some way but I dont see how

Once or twice she had thought Now the time is coming but it never
did for winter shut in very cold and it took so much more to feed and
warm them that the money went faster than ever And then when the way
seemed clear again the store changed hands so that for a long time she
failed to get her usual supply of sacks and coats to make and that
made sad havoc in the quarters and halfdollars laid up as her nest egg
ButWell itll come some time she would say to herself because it
must And so at it again she would fly brisker than ever

To help mother was the great ambition of all the children older
and younger but in Pollys and Bens souls the desire grew so
overwhelmingly great as to absorb all lesser thoughts Many and vast
were their secret plans by which they were to astonish her at some
future day which they would only confideas they did everything
elseto one another For this brother and sister were everything to
each other and stood loyally together through thick and thin

Polly was ten and Ben one year older and the younger three of the
Five Little Peppers as they were always called looked up to them
with the intensest admiration and love What they failed to do couldnt
very well be done by any One

Oh dear exclaimed Polly as she sat over in the corner by the window
helping her mother pull out basting threads from a coat she had just
finished and giving an impatient twitch to the sleeve I do wish we
could ever have any lightjust as much as we want

You dont need any light to see these threads said Mrs Pepper
winding up hers carefully as she spoke on an old spool Take care
Polly you broke that threads dear now

I couldnt help it said Polly vexedly it snapped everythings
dear now it seems to me I wish we could haveoh ever an ever so
many candles as many as we wanted Id light em all so there and
have it light here one night anyway

Yes and go dark all the rest of the year like as anyway observed
Mrs Pepper stopping to untie a knot Folks who do so never have any
candles she added sententiously

How manyd you have Polly asked Joel curiously laying down his
hammer and regarding her with the utmost anxiety

Oh two hundred said Polly decidedly Id have two hundred all in
a row

Two hundred candles echoed Joel in amazement My whockety what a
lot

Dont say such dreadful words Joel put in Polly nervously stopping
to pick up her spool of basting thread that was racing away all by
itself tisnt nice

Tisnt worse than to wish youd got things you havent retorted Joel
I dont believe youd light em all at once he added incredulously

Yes I would too replied Polly reckessly two hundred of em if I
had a chance all at once so there Joey Pepper

Oh said little Davie drawing a long sigh Why twould be just like
heaven Polly but wouldnt it cost money though

I dont care said Polly giving a flounce in her chair which snapped
another thread oh dear me I didnt mean to mammy well I wouldnt
care how much money it cost wed have as much light as we wanted for
once so

Mercy said Mrs Pepper youd have the house afire Two hundred
candles who ever heard of such a thing

Would they burn asked Phronsie anxiously getting up from the floor
where she was crouching with David overseeing Joel nail on the cover of
an old box and going to Pollys side she awaited her answer patiently

Burn said Polly There thats done now mamsie dear And she put
the coat with a last little pat into her mothers lap I guess they
would Phronsie pet And Polly caught up the little girl and spun
round and round the old kitchen till they were both glad to stop

Then said Phronsie as Polly put her down and stood breathless after
her last glorious spin I do so wish we might Polly oh just this
very one minute

And Phronsie clasped her fat little hands in rapture at the thought

Well said Polly giving a look up at the old clock in the corner
deary me its halfpast five and most time for Ben to come home

Away she flew to get supper So for the next few moments nothing was
heard but the pulling out of the old table into the middle of the floor
the laying the cloth and all the other bustle attendant upon the
being ready for Ben Polly went skipping around cutting the bread
and bringing dishes only stopping long enough to fling some scraps of
reassuring nonsense to the two boys who were thoroughly dismayed at
being obliged to remove their traps into a corner

Phronsie still stood just where Polly left her Two hundred candles oh
what could it mean She gazed up to the old beams overhead and around
the dingy walls and to the old black stove with the fire nearly out
and then over everything the kitchen contained trying to think how it
would seem To have it bright and winsome and warm to suit Pollyoh
she screamed

Goodness said Polly taking her head out of the old cupboard in the
corner how you scared me Phronsie

Would they ever go out asked the child gravely still standing where
Polly left her

What asked Polly stopping with a dish of cold potatoes in her hand
What Phronsie

Why the candles said the child the everanever so many pretty
lights

Oh my senses cried Polly with a little laugh havent you
forgotten that Yesno that is Phronsie if we could have em at all
we wouldnt ever let em go out

Not once asked Phronsie coming up to Polly with a little skip and
nearly upsetting her potatoes and allnot once Polly truly

No not foreveranever said Polly take care Phronsie there goes
a potato no wed keep em always

No you dont want to said Mrs Pepper coming out of the bedroom in
time to catch the last words they wont be good tomorrow better have
them tonight Polly

Maam said Polly setting down her potatodish on the table and
staring at her mother with all her mighthave what mother

Why the potatoes to be sure replied Mrs Pepper didnt you say
you better keep them child

Twasnt potatoesat all said Polly with a little gasp twasdear
me heres Ben For the door opened and Phronsie with a scream of
delight bounded into Bens arms

Its just jolly said Ben coming in his chubby face all aglow and
his big blue eyes shining so honest and true its just jolly to get
home supper ready Polly

Yes said Polly that isall but and she dashed off for
Phronsies eating apron

Sometime said Phronsie with her mouth half full when the meal was
nearly over were going to be awful rich we are Ben truly

No said Ben affecting the most hearty astonishment you dont say
so Chick

Yes said Phronsie shaking her yellow head very wisely at him and
diving down into her cup of very weak milk and water to see if Polly had
put any sugar in by mistakea proceeding always expectantly observed
Yes we are really Bensie very dreadful rich

I wish we could be rich now then said Ben taking another generous
slice of the brown bread in time for mamsies birthday and he cast a
sorrowful glance at Polly

I know said Polly oh dear if we only could celebrate it

I dont want any other celebration said Mrs Pepper beaming on
them so that a little flash of sunshine seemed to hop right down on the
table than to look round on you all Im rich now and thats a fact

Mamsie dont mind her five bothers cried Polly jumping up and
running to hug her mother thereby producing a like desire in all the
others who immediately left their seats and followed her example

Mothers rich enough ejaculated Mrs Pepper her bright black eyes
glistening with delight as the noisy troop filed back to their bread
and potatoes if we can only keep together dears and grow up good so
that the little brown house wont be ashamed of us thats all I ask

Well said Polly in a burst of confidence to Ben after the table had
been pushed back against the wall the dishes nicely washed wiped and
set up neatly in the cupboard and all traces of the meal cleared away
I dont care lets try and get a celebration somehow for mamsie

How are you going to do it asked Ben who was of a decidedly
practical turn of mind and thus couldnt always follow Polly in her
flights of imagination

I dont know said Polly but we must some way

Phoh thats no good said Ben disdainfully then seeing Pollys
face he added kindly lets think though and perhaps therell be
some way

Oh I know cried Polly in delight I know the very thing Ben
lets make her a cake a big one you know and

Shell see you bake it said Ben or else shell smell it and thatd
be just as bad

No she wont either replied Polly Dont you know shes going to
help Mrs Henderson tomorrow so there

So she is said Ben good for you Polly you always think of
everything

And then said Polly with a comfortable little feeling at her heart
at Bens praise why we can have it all out of the way splendidly you
know when she comes homeand besides Grandma Bascomll tell me how
You know weve only got brown flour Ben I mean to go right over and
ask her now

Oh no you mustnt cried Ben catching hold of her arm as she was
preparing to fly off Mammyll find it out better wait till tomorrow
and besides Polly And Ben stopped unwilling to dampen this
propitious beginning The stovell act like everything tomorrow I
know twill then whatll you do

It shant said Polly running up to look it in the face if it
does Ill shake it the mean old thing

The idea of Pollys shaking the lumbering old black affair sent Ben
into such a peal of laughter that it brought all the other children
running to the spot and nothing would do but they must one and all be
told the reason So Polly and Ben took them into confidence which
so elated them that half an hour after when long past her bedtime
Phronsie declared Im not going to bed I want to sit up like Polly

Dont tease her whispered Polly to Ben who thought she ought to go
so she sat straight up on her little stool winking like everything to
keep awake

At last as Polly was in the midst of one of her liveliest sallies over
tumbled Phronsie a sleepy little heap upon the floor

I wantto goto bed she said take mePolly

I thought so laughed Polly and bundled her off into the bedroom




MAKING HAPPINESS FOR MAMSIE


And so the minute her mother had departed for the ministers house next
morning and Ben had gone to his days work chopping wood for Deacon
Blodgett Polly assembled her force around the old stove and proceeded
to business She and the children had been up betimes that morning to
get through with the work and now as they glanced around with a look
of pride on the neatly swept floor the dishes all done and everything
in order the moment their mothers back was turned they began to
implore Polly to hurry and begin

Its most leven oclock said Joel who having no work to do
outside that day was prancing around wild to help along the
festivities its most leven oclock Polly Pepper you wont have it
done

Oh no tisnt either Joe said Polly with a very flushed face and
her arms full of kindlings glancing up at the old clock as she spoke
tisnt but quarter of nine there take care Phronsie you cant lift
off the cover do help her Davie

No let me cried Joel springing forward its my turn Dave got the
shingles its my turn Polly

So tis said Polly I forgot there as she flung in the wood
and poked it all up in a nice little heap coaxingly It cant help but
burn what a cake well have for mamsie

Itll be so big cried Phronsie hopping around on one set of toes
that mamsie wont know what to do will she Polly

No I dont believe she will said Polly gayly stuffing in more
wood Oh dear there goes Bens putty its all come out

So it has said Joel going around back of the stove to explore and
then he added cheerfully its biggern ever oh its an awful big
hole Polly

Now whatever shall we do said Polly in great distress that
hateful old crack and Bens clear off to Deacon Blodgetts

Ill run and get him cried Joel briskly Ill bring him right home
in ten minutes

Oh no you must not Joe cried Polly in alarm it wouldnt ever be
right to take him off from his work mamsie wouldnt like it

What will you do then asked Joel pausing on his way to the door

Im sure I dont know said Polly getting down on her knees to
examine the crack I shall have to stuff it with paper I spose

Twont stay in said Joel scornfully dont you know you stuffed it
before last week

I know said Polly with a small sigh and sitting down on the floor
she remained quite still for a minute with her two black hands thrust
out straight before her

Cant you fix it asked Davie soberly coming up then we cant have
the cake

Dear me exclaimed Polly springing up quickly dont be afraid
were going to have that cake There you ugly old thing you this
to the stove see what youve done as two big tears flew out of
Phronsies brown eyes at the direful prospect and the sorrowful faces
of the two boys looked up into Pollys own for comfort I can fix it
I most know do get some paper Joe as quick as you can

Dont know where there is any said Joel rummaging around its all
tore up xcept the almanac cant I take that

Oh dear no cried Polly put it right back Joe I guess theres
some in the woodshed

There isnt either said little Davie quickly Joel and I took it to
make kites with

Oh dear groaned Polly I dont know what we shall do unless as a
bright thought struck her you let me have the kites boys

Cant said Joel theyre all flew away and torn up

Well now children said Polly turning round impressively upon them
the effect of which was heightened by the extremely crocky appearance
she had gained in her explorations we must have some paper or
something to stop up that old hole withsome way there

I know said little Davie where well get it its upstairs and
without another word he flew out of the room and in another minute he
put into Pollys hand an old leather boottop one of his most treasured
possessions You can chip it he said real fine and then twill go
in

So we can said Polly and youre a real good boy Davie to give it
thats a splendid present to help celebrate for mamsie

Id agiven a boottop said Joel looking grimly at the precious bit
of leather which Polly was rapidly stripping into little bits if Id
ahed it I dont have anything

I know you would Joey said Polly kindly there now youll stay
I guess as with the united efforts of the two boys cheered on by
Phronsies enthusiastic little crow of delight the leather was crowded
into place and the fire began to burn

Now boys said Polly getting up and drawing a long breath Im
going over to Grandma Bascoms to get her to tell me how to make the
cake and you must stay and keep house

Im going to nail said Joel Ive got lots to do

All right said Polly tying on her hood Phronsiell love to watch
you I wont be gone long and she was off

Grandma Bascom wasnt really the childrens grandmother only
everybody in the village called her so by courtesy Her cottage was over
across the lane and just a bit around the corner and Polly flew along
and up to the door fully knowing that now she would be helped out of
her difficulty She didnt stop to knock as the old lady was so deaf
she knew she wouldnt hear her but opened the door and walked in
Grandma was sweeping up the floor already as neat as a pin when she
saw Polly coming she stopped and leaned on her broom

Hows your ma she asked when Polly had said good morning and then
hesitated

Oh mammys pretty well shouted Polly into the old ladys ear and
tomorrows her birthday

Tomorrowll be a bad day said grandma Oh dont never say that
You mustnt borrow trouble child

I didnt said Polly I meanits her birthday grandma this last
so loud that grandmas capborder vibrated perceptibly

The lands sakes tis cried Mrs Bascom delightedly you dont say
so

Yes said Polly skipping around the old lady and giving her a small
hug and were going to give her a surprise

What is the matter with her eyes asked grandma sharply turning
around and facing her shes been asewin too stiddy haint she

A surprise shouted Polly standing upon tiptoe to bring her mouth on
a level with the old ladys ear a cake grandma a big one

A cake exclaimed grandma dropping the broom to settle her cap which
Polly in her extreme endeavors to carry on the conversation had knocked
slightly awry well thatll be fine

Yes said Polly picking up the broom and flinging off her hood
at the same time and oh wont you please tell me how to make it
grandma

To be sure to be sure cried the old lady delighted beyond measure
to give advice Ive got splendid receets Ill go get em right off
and she ambled to the door of the pantry

And Ill finish sweeping up said Polly which grandma didnt hear
so she took up the broom and sent it energetically and merrily flying
away to the tune of her own happy thoughts

Yes theyre right in here said grandma waddling back with an old
tin teapot in her handgoodness child what a dust youve kicked
up that aint the way to sweep And she took the broom out of Pollys
hand who stood quite still in mortification

There she said drawing it mildly over the few bits she could scrape
together and gently coaxing them into a little heap thats the way
and then they dont go all over the room

Im sorry began poor Polly

Taint any matter said Mrs Bascom kindly catching sight of Pollys
discomfited face taint a mite of matter youll sweep better next
time now lets go to the cake and putting the broom into the corner
she waddled back again to the table followed by Polly and proceeded
to turn out the contents of the teapot in search of just the right
receet

But the right one didnt seem to appear not even after the teapot was
turned upside down and shaken by both grandmas and Pollys anxious
hands Every other receet seemed to tumble out gladly and stare them
in the facelittle dingy rolls of yellow paper with an ancient odor
of spice still clinging to them but all efforts to find this particular
one failed utterly

Wont some other one do asked Polly in the interval of fruitless
searching when grandma bewailed and lamented and wondered where I
could a put it

No no child answered the old lady now where do you spose tis
and she clapped both hands to her head to see if she could possibly
remember no no child she repeated Why they had it down to my
niece Mirandys weddintwas just elegant light as a feather and
twant rich either she added no eggs nor

Oh I couldnt have eggs cried Polly in amazement at the thought of
such luxury and weve only brown flour grandma you know

Well you can make it of brown said Mrs Bascom kindly when the
raisins is in twill look quite nice

Oh we havent any raisins answered Polly

Havent any raisins echoed grandma looking at her over her
spectacles what are you goin to put in

Ohcinnamon said Polly briskly weve got plenty of that
anditll be good I guess grandma she finished anxiously anyway
we must have a cake there isnt any other way to celebrate mamsies
birthday

Well now said grandma bustling around I shouldnt be surprised
if you had real good luck Polly And your mall set ever so much by it
now if we only could find that receet and returning to the charge she
commenced to fumble among her bits of paper again I never shall forget
how they eat on it why there wasnt a crumb left Polly

Oh dear said Polly to whom Mirandys wedding cake now became the
height of her desires if you only can find it cant I climb up and
look on the pantry shelves

Maybe tis there said Mrs Bascom slowly you might try sometimes
I do put things away sos to have em safe

So Polly got an old wooden chair according to direction and then
mounted up on it with grandma below to direct she handed down bowl
after bowl interspersed at the right intervals with cracked teacups and
handleless pitchers But at the end of these explorations Mirandys
wedding cake was further off than ever

Taint a mite o use at last said the old lady sinking down in
despair while Polly perched on the top of the chair and looked at her
I must agive it away

Cant I have the next best one then asked Polly despairingly
feeling sure that Mirandys wedding cake would have celebrated the day
just right and I must hurry right home please she added getting
down from the chair and tying on her hood or Phronsie wont know what
to do

So another receet was looked over and selected and with many
charges and bits of advice not to let the oven get too hot etc etc
Polly took the precious bit in her hand and flew over home

Now weve got to she began bounding in merrily with dancing eyes
but her delight had a sudden stop as she brought up so suddenly at
the sight within that she couldnt utter another word Phronsie was
crouching a miserable little heap of woe in one corner of the mothers
big calicocovered rockingchair and crying bitterly while Joel hung
over her in the utmost concern

Whats the matter gasped Polly Flinging the receet on the table
she rushed up to the old chair and was down on her knees before it her
arms around the little figure Phronsie turned and threw herself into
Pollys protecting arms who gathered her up and sitting down in the
depths of the chair comforted her as only she could

What is it she asked of Joel who was nervously begging Phronsie not
to cry now tell me all thats happened

I was anailing began Joel oh dear dont cry Phronsie do stop
her Polly

Go on said Polly hoarsely

I was anailing began Joel slowly andandDavies gone to get
the peppermint he added brightening up

Tell me Joe said Polly all thats been going on and she looked
sternly into his face or Ill get Davie to as little Davie came
running back with a bottle of castor oil which in his flurry he had
mistaken for peppermint This he presented with a flourish to Polly who
was too excited to see it

Oh no cried Joel in intense alarm Davie isnt going to Ill
tell Polly I will truly

Go on then said Polly tell at once feeling as if somebody
didnt tell pretty quick she should tumble over

Well said Joel gathering himself up with a fresh effort the old
hammer was ashaking and Phronsie stuck her foot in the wayandI
couldnt help it Pollyno I just couldnt Polly

Quick as a flash Polly tore off the little old shoe and wellworn
stocking and brought to light Phronsies fat little foot Tenderly
taking hold of the white toes the boys clustering around in the
greatest anxiety she worked them back and forth and up and down
Nothings broken she said at last and drew a long breath

Its there said Phronsie through a rain of tears and it hurts
Polly and she began to wiggle the big toe where around the nail was
settling a small black spot

Poor little toe began Polly cuddling up the suffering foot Just
then a small and peculiar noise struck her ear and looking up she saw
Joel with a very distorted face making violent efforts to keep from
bursting out into a loud cry All his attempts however failed and
he flung himself into Pollys lap in a perfect torrent of tears I
didntmean toPolly he cried twas theugly old hammer oh
dear

There there Joey dear said Polly gathering him up in the other
corner of the old chair close to her side dont feel bad I know you
didnt mean to and she dropped a kiss on his stubby black hair

When Phronsie saw that anybody else could cry she stopped immediately
and leaning over Polly put one little fat hand on Joels neck Dont
cry she said does your toe ache

At this Joel screamed louder than ever and Polly was at her wits
end to know what to do for the boys heart was almost broken That he
should have hurt Phronsie the baby the pet of the whole house upon
whom all their hearts centeredit was too much So for the next few
moments Polly had all she could do by way of comforting and consoling
him Just as she had succeeded the door opened and Grandma Bascom
walked in

Settin down said she I hope your cake aint in Polly looking
anxiously at the stove for Ive found it and she waved a small piece
of paper triumphantly towards the rockingchair as she spoke

Do tell her said Polly to little David whats happened for I cant
get up

So little Davie went up to the old lady and standing on tiptoe
screamed into her ear all the particulars he could think of concerning
the accident that had just happened

Hey said grandma in a perfect bewilderment whats he asayin
PollyI cant make it out

Youll have to go all over it again David said Polly despairingly
she didnt hear one word I dont believe

So David tried again this time with better success And then he got
down from his tiptoes and escorted grandma to Phronsie in flushed
triumph

Land alive said the old lady sitting down in the chair which he
brought her you got pounded did you looking at Phronsie as she
took the little foot in her ample hand

Yesm said Polly quickly twasnt any ones fault whatll we do
for it grandma

Wormwood said the old lady adjusting her spectacles in extreme
deliberation and then examining the little black and blue spot which
was spreading rapidly is the very best thing and Ive got some to
homeyou run right over she said turning round on David quickly
an get it its ahangin by the chimbley

Let me let me cried Joel springing out of the old chair so
suddenly that grandmas spectacles nearly dropped off in fright oh I
want to do it for Phronsie

Yes let Joel please put in Polly hell find it grandma So Joel
departed with great speed and presently returned with a bunch of dry
herbs which dangled comfortingly by his side as he came in

Now Ill fix it said Mrs Bascom getting up and taking off her
shawl theres a few raisins for you Polly I dont want em and
theyll make your cake go better and she placed a little parcel on the
table as she spoke Yes Ill put it to steep an after its put on
real strong and tied up in an old cloth Phronsie wont know as shes
got any toes and grandma broke up a generous supply of the herb and
put it into an old tin cup which she covered up with a saucer and
placed on the stove

Oh said Polly I cant thank you for the raisins and allyoure so
good

Theyre awful hard said Joel investigating into the bundle with
Davie which however luckily the old lady didnt hear

There dont try she said cheerily an I found cousin Mirandys
weddin cake receet for

Did you cried Polly oh Im so glad feeling as if that were
comfort enough for a good deal

Yes twas in my Bible said Mrs Bascom I remember now I put it
there to be ready to give Johns folks when they come in they wanted
it so youll go all straight now and I must get home for I left some
meat aboilin So grandma put on her shawl and waddled off leaving a
great deal of comfort behind her

Now says I said Polly to Phronsie when the little foot was snugly
tied up in the wet wormwood youve got to have one of mamsies old
slippers

Oh ho laughed Phronsie wont that be funny Polly

I should think it would laughed Polly back again pulling on the
big cloth slipper which Joel produced from the bedroom the two boys
joining uproariously as the old black thing flapped dismally up and
down and showed strong symptoms of flying off We shall have to tie it
on

It looks like a pudding bag said Joel as Polly tied it securely
through the middle with a bit of twine an old black pudding bag he
finished

Old black pudding bag echoed Phronsie with a merry little crow and
then all of a sudden she grew very sober and looked intently at the
foot thrust out straight before her as she still sat in the chair

What is it Phronsie asked Polly who was bustling around making
preparations for the cakemaking

Can I ever wear my new shoes again asked the child gravely looking
dismally at the black bundle before her

Oh yes my goodness yes cried Polly as quick again as ever
youll be around again as smart as a cricket in a weeksee if you
arent

Will it go on asked Phronsie still looking incredulously at the
bundle and button up

Yes indeed cried Polly again button into every one of the little
holes Phronsie Pepper just as elegant as ever

Oh said Phronsie and then she gave a sigh of relief and thought no
more of it because Polly had said that all would be right




MAMSIES BIRTHDAY


Run down and get the cinnamon will you Joey said Polly its in
the Provision Room

The Provision Room was a little shed that was tacked on to the main
house and reached by a short flight of rickety steps so called
because as Polly said twas a good place to keep provisions in even
if we havent any and besides she always finished it sounds nice

Come on Dave then well get something to eat

So the cinnamon was handed up and then Joel flew back to Davie

And now Pollys cake was done and ready for the oven With many
admiring glances from herself and Phronsie who with Seraphina an
extremely old but greatly revered doll tightly hugged in her arms was
watching everything with the biggest of eyes from the depths of the old
chair it was placed in the oven the door shut to with a happy little
bang then Polly gathered Phronsie up in her arms and sat down in the
chair to have a good time with her and to watch the process of cooking

There was a bumping noise that came from the Provision Room that
sounded ominous and then a smothered sound of words followed by a
scuffling over the old floor

Boys called Polly No answer everything was just as still as a
mouse Joel and David called Polly again in her loudest tones

Yes came up the crooked stairs in Davies voice

Come up here right away went back again from Polly So up the stairs
trudged the two boys and presented themselves rather sheepishly before
the big chair

What was that noise she asked what have you been doing

Twasnt anything but the pail answered Joel not looking at her

We had something to eat said Davie by way of explanation you
always let us

I know said Polly thats right you can have as much bread as you
want to but what you been doing with the pail

Nothing said Joel twouldnt hangup thats all

And youve been bumping it said Polly oh Joel how could you You
might have broken it then what would mamsie say

I didnt said Joel stoutly with his hands in his pockets bump it
worsen Davie so there

Why Davie said Polly turning to him sorrowfully I shouldnt have
thought you would

Well Im tired of hanging it up said little Davie vehemently and
I said I wasnt agoin to Joel always makes me Ive done it for two
million times I guess

Oh dear said Polly sinking back into the chair I dont know
what I ever shall do heres Phronsie hurt and we want to celebrate
tomorrow and you two boys are bumping and banging out the bread pail
and

Oh we wont cried both of the children perfectly overwhelmed with
remorse well hang it right up

Ill hang it said Davie clattering off down the stairs with a will

No I will shouted Joel going after him at double pace and
presently both came up with shining faces and reported it nicely done

And now said Polly after they had all sat around the stove another
halfhour watching and sniffing expectantly the cakes donedear
me its turning black

And quickly as possible Polly twitched it out with energy and set it on
the table

Oh dear of all things in the world The beautiful cake over which so
many hopes had been formed that was to have given so much happiness
on the morrow to the dear mother presented a forlorn appearance as it
stood there in anything but holiday attire It was quite black on the
top in the center of which was a depressing little dump as if to say
My feelings wouldnt allow me to rise to the occasion

Now said Polly turning away with a little fling and looking at
the stove I hope youre satisfied you old thing youve spoiled our
mamsies birthday and without a bit of warning she sat right down in
the middle of the floor and began to cry as hard as she could

Well I never said a cheery voice that made the children skip

Its Mrs Beebe oh its Mrs Beebe cried Davie see Polly

Polly scrambled up to her feet ashamed to be caught thus and whisked
away the tears the others explaining to their new visitor the sad
disappointment that had befallen them and she was soon ohing and
ahing enough to suit even their distressed little souls

You poor creeters you she exclaimed at last for about the fiftieth
time Here Polly heres some posies for you and

Oh thank you cried Polly with a radiant face why Mrs Beebe we
can put them in here cant we the very thing

And she set the little knot of flowers in the hollow of the cake and
there they stood and nodded away to the delighted children like brave
little comforters as they were

The very thing echoed Mrs Beebe tickled to death to see their
delight it looks beautiful I declare and now I must run right
along or pall be worrying and so the good woman trotted out to her
waiting husband who was impatient to be off Mr Beebe kept a little
shoe shop in town and always being of the impression if he left it for
ten minutes that crowds of customers would visit it He was the most
restless of companions on any pleasure excursion

And Phronsies got hurt said Mrs Beebe telling him the news as he
finished tucking her up and started the old horse

Ho you dont say so he cried whoa

Dear me said Mrs Beebe how you scat me pal whats the matter

Whatthe little girl that bought the shoes asked her husband

Yes replied his wife shes hurt her foot

Sho now said the old gentleman thats too bad and he began to
feel in all his pockets industriously there can you get out again
and take her that and he laid a small piece of peppermint candy thick
and white in his wifes lap

Oh yes cried Mrs Beebe goodnaturedly beginning to clamber over
the wheel

So the candy was handed in to Phronsie who insisted that Polly should
hold her up to the window to thank Mr Beebe So amid nods and shakings
of hands the Beebes drove off and quiet settled down over the little
brown house again

Now children said Polly after Phronsie had made them take a bite of
her candy all around lets get the cake put away safe for mamsie may
come home early

Wherell you put it asked Joel wishing the world was all peppermint
candy

Ohin the cupboard said Polly taking it up there Joe you can
climb up and put it clear back in the corner oh wait I must take
the posies off and keep them fresh in water so the cake was finally
deposited in a place of safety followed by the eyes of all the
children

Now said Polly as they shut the door tight dont you go to looking
at the cupboard Joey or mammyll guess something

Cant I just open it a little crack and take one smell when she isnt
looking asked Joel I should think you might Polly just one

No said Polly firmly not one Joe shell guess if you do But
Mrs Pepper was so utterly engrossed with her baby when she came home
and heard the account of the accident that she wouldnt have guessed
if thered been a dozen cakes in the cupboard Joel was consoled as his
mother assured him in a satisfactory way that she never should think
of blaming him and Phronsie was comforted and coddled to her hearts
content And so the evening passed rapidly and happily away Ben
smuggling Phronsie off into a corner where she told him all the doings
of the daythe disappointment of the cake and how it was finally
crowned with flowers all of which Phronsie with no small pride in
being the narrator related gravely to her absorbed listener And dont
you think Bensie she said clasping her little hand in a convincing
way over his two bigger stronger ones that Pollys stove was very
naughty to make poor Polly cry

Yes I do said Ben and he shut his lips tightly together

To have Polly cry hurt him more than he cared to have Phronsie see

What are you staring at Joe asked Polly a few minutes later as her
eyes fell upon Joel who sat with his back to the cupboard persistently
gazing at the opposite wall

Why you told me yourself not to look at the cupboard said Joel in
the loudest of stage whispers

Dear me thatll make mammy suspect worsen anything else if you look
like that said Polly

What did you say about the cupboard asked Mrs Pepper who caught
Joes last word

We cant tell said Phronsie shaking her head at her mother cause
theres a ca Ugh and Polly clapped her hand on the childs
mouth dont you want Ben to tell us a story

Oh yes cried little Phronsie in which all the others joined with
a whoop of delight so a most wonderful story drawn up in Bens best
style followed till bedtime

The first thing Polly did in the morning was to run to the old
cupboard followed by all the others to see if the cake was safe and
then it had to be drawn out and dressed anew with the flowers for they
had decided to have it on the breakfast table

It looks better whispered Polly to Ben than it did yesterday and
arent the flowers pretty

It looks good enough to eat anyway said Ben smacking his lips

Well we tried said Polly stilling a sigh now boys call mamsie
everythings ready

Oh how surprised their mother appeared when she was ushered out to the
feast and the full glory of the table burst upon her Her delight in
the cake was fully enough to satisfy the most exacting mind She
admired and admired it on every side protesting that she shouldnt have
supposed Polly could possibly have baked it as good in the old stove
and then she cut it and gave a piece to every child with a little posy
on top Wasnt it good though for like many other things the cake
proved better on trial than it looked and so turned out to be really
quite a good surprise all around

Why cant I ever have a birthday asked Joel finishing the last crumb
of his piece I should think I might he added reflectively

Why you have Joe said Ben eight of em

What a story ejaculated Joel when did I have em I never had a
cake did I Polly

Not a cakebirthday Joel said his mother you havent got to that
yet

Whens it coming asked Joel who was decidedly of a matteroffact
turn of mind

I dont know said Mrs Pepper laughing but theres plenty of time
ahead




TROUBLE FOR THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE


Oh I do wish said Joel a few mornings after pushing back his chair
and looking discontentedly at his bowl of mush and molasses that we
could ever have something new besides this everlasting old breakfast
Why cant we mammy

Better be glad youve got that Joe said Mrs Pepper taking another
cold potato and sprinkling on a little salt folks shouldnt complain
so long as theyve anything to eat

But Im so tired of itsame old thing growled Joel seems as if I
shd turn into a mealbag or a molasses jug

Well hand it over then proposed Ben who was unusually hungry and
had a hard days work before him

No said Joel alarmed at the prospect and putting in an enormous
mouthful its better than nothing

Oh dear said little Phronsie catching Joels tone it isnt nice
no it isnt And she put down her spoon so suddenly that the molasses
spun off in a big drop that trailed off the corner of the table and
made Polly jump up and run for the floorcloth

Oh Phronsie she said reprovingly you ought not to Never mind
pet as she caught sight of two big tears trying to make a path in the
little molassesstreaked face Pollyll wipe it up

Shant we ever have anything else to eat Polly asked the child
gravely getting down from her high chair to watch the operation of
cleaning the floor

Oh yes said Polly cheerfully lots and lotswhen our ship comes
in

Whatll they be asked Phronsie in the greatest delight prepared for
anything

Oh I dont know said Polly ice cream for one thing Phronsie and
maybe little cakes

With pink on top interrupted Phronsie getting down by Pollys side

Oh yes said Polly warming with her subject ever and ever so much
pink Phronsie Pepper more than you could eat

Phronsie just clasped her hands and sighed More than she could eat was
beyond her

Hoh said Joel who caught the imaginary bill of fare thats
nothing Polly Id speak for a plumpuddin

Like the one mother made us for Thanksgiving asked Polly getting up
and waiting a minute cloth in hand for the answer

Yes sir said Joel shutting one eye and looking up at the ceiling
musingly while he smacked his lips in remembrance wasnt that prime
though

Yes said Polly thoughtfully would you have em all like that
Joe

Every one replied Joe promptly Id have seventyfive of em

Seventyfive what asked Mrs Pepper who had gone into the bedroom
and now came out a coat in hand to sit down in the west window where
she began to sew rapidly Better clear up the dishes Polly and set
the table backseventyfive what Joel

Plumpuddings said Joel kissing Phronsie

Dear me ejaculated Mrs Pepper you dont know what youre saying
Joel Pepper the house couldnt hold em

Wouldnt long responded Joel wed eat em

That would be foolish interposed Ben Id have roast beef and
fixingsand oystersand huckleberry pie

Oh dear cried Polly how nice Ben you always do think of the very
best things

But Joel phoohed and declared he wouldnt waste his time over old beef
hed have something like And then he cried

Come on Dave whatd you choose

Little Davie had been quietly eating his breakfast amid all this
chatter and somehow thinking it might make the mother feel badly he
had refrained from saying just how tiresome he had really found this
everlasting breakfast as Joel called it But now he looked up eagerly
his answer all ready Oh I know he cried what would be most
beautiful toasted breadwhite breadand candy

Whats candy asked Phronsie

Oh dont you know Phronsie cried Polly what Mrs Beebe gave you
the day you got your shoesthe pink sticks and

And the peppermint stick Mr Beebe gave you Phronsie finished Joel
his mouth watering at the remembrance

That day when you got your toe pounded added Davie looking at Joel

Oh cried Phronsie I want some now I do

Well Davie said Polly you shall have that for breakfast when our
ship comes in then

Your ships arent ever coming broke in Mrs Pepper wisely if you
sit there talkingfolks dont ever make any fortunes by wishing

True enough laughed Ben jumping up and setting back his chair Come
on Joe youve got to pile today

Oh dear said Joel dismally I wish Mr Blodgetts wood was all
afire

Never say that Joel said Mrs Pepper looking up sternly its
biting your own nose off to wish that wood was afireand besides its
dreadfully wicked

Joel hung his head for his mother never spoke in that way unless she
was strongly moved but he soon recovered and hastened off for his
jacket

Im sorry I cant help you do the dishes Polly said David running
after Joel

Im going to help her said Phronsie I am

So Polly got the little wooden tub that she always used gave Phronsie
the wellworn cupnapkin and allowed her to wipe the handleless cups
and cracked saucers which afforded the little one intense delight

Dont you wish Polly said little Phronsie bustling around with a
very important air nearly smothered in the depths of a big brown
apron that Polly had carefully tied under her chin that you didnt
everanever have so many dishes to do

Ummaybe said Polly thoughtlessly She was thinking of something
else besides cups and saucers just then of how nice it would be to go
off for just one day and do exactly as she had a mind to in everything
She even envied Ben and the boys who were going to work hard at Deacon
Blodgetts woodpile

Well I tell you said Phronsie confidentially setting down a
cup that she had polished with great care Im going to do em all
tomorrow for you PollyI can truly let me now Polly do

Nonsense said Polly giving a great splash with her mop in the tub
ashamed of her inward repinings Phronsie youre no bigger than a
mouse

Yes I am retorted Phronsie very indignantly Her face began to get
very red and she straightened up so suddenly to show Polly just how
very big she was that her little head came up against the edge of the
tubover it went a pile of saucers followed

There now cried Polly see what youve done

Ow whimpered Phronsie breaking into a subdued roar oh Polly its
all running down my back

Is it said Polly bursting out into a laugh never mind Phronsie
Ill dry you

Dear me Polly said Mrs Pepper who had looked up in time to see the
tub racing along by itself towards the Provision Room door a stream
of dishwater following in its wake she will be wet clear through do
get off her things quick

Yesm cried Polly picking up the tub and giving two or three quick
sops to the floor Here you are Pussy grasping Phronsie crying as
she was and carrying her into the bedroom

Oh dear wailed the child still holding the wet dish towel I wont
ever do it again if youll only let me do em all tomorrow

When youre big and strong said Polly giving her a hug you shall
do em every day

May I really said little Phronsie blinking through the tears and
looking radiant

Yes trulyevery day

Then Ill grow right away I will said Phronsie bursting out
merrily and she sat down and pulled off the wellworn shoes into which
a big pool of dishwater had run while Polly went for dry stockings

So you shall said Polly coming back a big piece of gingerbread in
her hand and thisll make you grow Phronsie

Ooh and Phronsies little white teeth shut down quickly on the
comforting morsel Gingerbread didnt come often enough into the Pepper
household to be lightly esteemed

Now said Mrs Pepper when order was restored the floor washed
up brightly and every cup and platter in place hobnobbing away to
themselves on the shelves of the old corner cupboard and Polly had come
as usual with needle and thread to help motherPolly was getting so
that she could do the plain parts on the coats and jackets which
filled her with pride at the very thoughtnow said Mrs Pepper you
neednt help me this morning Polly Im getting on pretty smart but
you may just run down to the parsons and see how he is

Is he sick asked Polly in awe

To have the parson sick was something quite different from an ordinary
persons illness

Hes taken with a chill said Mrs Pepper biting off a thread so
Miss Huldy Folsom told me last night and Im afraid hes going to have
a fever

Oh dear said Polly in dire distress whateverd we do mammy

Dont know Im sure replied Mrs Pepper setting her stitches
firmly the Lordll provide So you run along child and see how he
is

Cant Phronsie go asked Polly pausing halfway to the bedroom door

Well yes I suppose she might said Mrs Pepper assentingly

No she cant either said Polly coming back with her sunbonnet in
her hand and shutting the door carefully after her cause shes fast
asleep on the floor

Is she said Mrs Pepper well shes been running so this morning
shes tired out I spose

And her face is dreadfully red continued Polly tying on her bonnet
now whatll I say mammy

Well I should think twould be said Mrs Pepper replying to the
first half of Pollys speech she cried so Well you just tell Mrs
Henderson your ma wants to know how Mr Henderson is this morning and
if twas a chill he had yesterday and how he slept last night and

Oh ma said Polly I cant ever remember all that

Oh yes you can said Mrs Pepper encouragingly just put your mind
on it Polly tisnt anything to what I used to have to rememberwhen
I was a little girl no bigger than you are

Polly sighed and feeling sure that something must be the matter with
her mind gave her whole attention to the errand till at last after a
multiplicity of messages and charges not to forget any one of them Mrs
Pepper let her depart

Up to the oldfashioned green door with its brass knocker Polly went
running over in her mind just which of the messages she ought to give
first She couldnt for her life think whether if twas a chill he had
yesterday ought to come before how he slept She knocked timidly
hoping Mrs Henderson would help her out of her difficulty by telling
her without the asking All other front doors in Badgertown were
ornaments only opened on grand occasions like a wedding or a funeral
But the ministers was accessible alike to all So Polly let fall the
knocker and awaited the answer

A scuffling noise sounded along the passage and then Pollys soul sank
down in dire dismay It was the ministers sister and not gentle little
Mrs Henderson She never could get on with Miss Jerusha in the least
She made her feel as she told her mother onceas if I dont know what
my name is And now here she was and all those messages

Miss Jerusha unbolted the door slid back the great bar opened the
upper half and stood there She was a big woman with sharp black eyes
and spectaclesover which she lookedwhich to Polly was much worse
for that gave her four eyes

Well and what do you want she asked

I came to seeI mean my ma sent me stammered poor Polly

And who is your ma demanded Miss Jerusha as much like a policeman as
anything and where do you live

I live in Primrose Lane replied Polly wishing very much that she was
back there

I dont want to know where you live before I know who you are said
Miss Jerusha you should answer the question I asked first always
remember that

My mas Mrs Pepper said Polly

Mrs who repeated Miss Jerusha

By this time Polly was so worn that she came very near turning and
fleeing but she thought of her mothers disappointment in her and the
loss of the news and stood quite still

What is it Jerusha a gentle voice here broke upon Pollys ear

I dont know responded Miss Jerusha tartly still holding the door
much as if Polly were a robber its a little girl and I cant make
out what she wants

Why its Polly Pepper exclaimed Mrs Henderson pleasantly Come
in child She opened the other half of the big door and led the
way through the wide hall into a big oldfashioned room with painted
floor and high old sideboard and some stiffbacked rockingchairs

Miss Jerusha stalked in also and seated herself by the window and began
to knit Polly had just opened her mouth to tell her errand when the
door also opened suddenly and Mr Henderson walked in

Oh said Polly and then she stopped and the color flushed up into
her face

What is it my dear and the minister took her hand kindly and looked
down into her flushed face

You are not going to have a fever and be sick and die she cried

I hope not my little girl he smiled back encouragingly and then
Polly gave her messages which now she managed easily enough

There broke in Miss Jerusha a cat cant sneeze in this town but
everybodyll know it in quarter of an hour

And then Mrs Henderson took Polly out to see a brood of new little
chicks that had just popped their heads out into the world and to
Polly down on her knees admiring the time passed very swiftly indeed

Now I must go maam she said at last looking up into the ladys
face regretfully for mammy didnt say I was to stay

Very well dear do you think you could carry a little pat of butter
I have some very nice my sister sent me and I want your mother to share
it

Oh thank you maam cried Polly thinking how glad Daviell be
for he does so love butter only

Wait a bit then said Mrs Henderson who didnt seem to notice the
objection So she went into the house and Polly went down again in
admiration before the fascinating little puffballs

But she was soon on the way with a little pat of butter in a blue bowl
tied over with a clean cloth happy in her gift for mammy and in the
knowledge of the minister being all well

I wonder if Phronsies awake she thought to herself turning in at
the little brown gate if she is she shall have a piece of bread with
lots of butter

Hush said Mrs Pepper from the rockingchair in the middle of the
floor She had something in her arms Polly stopped suddenly almost
letting the bowl fall

Its Phronsie said the mother and I dont know what the matter is
with her youll have to go for the doctor Polly and just as fast as
you can

Polly still stood holding the bowl and staring with all her might
Phronsie sick

Dont wake her said Mrs Pepper

Poor Polly couldnt have stirred to save her life for a minute then
she saidWhere shall I go

Oh run to Dr Fishers and dont be gone long

Polly set down the bowl of butter and sped on the wings of the wind for
the doctor Something dreadful was the matter she felt for never had
a physician been summoned to the hearty Pepper family since she could
remember only when the father died Fear lent speed to her feet and
soon the doctor came and bent over poor little Phronsie who still lay
in her mothers arms in a burning fever

Its measles he pronounced thats all no cause for alarm you ever
had it he asked turning suddenly around on Polly who was watching
with wideopen eyes for the verdict

No sir answered Polly not knowing in the least what measles was

What shall we do said Mrs Pepper there havent any of them had
it

The doctor was over by the little old table under the window mixing up
some blacklooking stuff in a tumbler and he didnt hear her

There he said putting a spoonful into Phronsies mouth shell get
along well enough only keep her out of the cold Then he pulled out a
big silver watch He was a little thin man and the watch was immense
Polly for her life couldnt keep her eyes off from it if Ben could only
have one so fine

Polly whispered Mrs Pepper run and get my purse its in the top
bureau drawer

Yesm said Polly taking her eyes off by a violent wrench from
the fascinating watch and she ran quickly and got the little old
stockingleg where the hard earnings that staid long enough to be put
anywhere always found refuge She put it into her mothers lap and
watched while Mrs Pepper counted out slowly one dollar in small pieces

Here sir said Mrs Pepper holding them out towards the doctor and
thank you for coming

Hey said the little man spinning round that dollars the Lords

Mrs Pepper looked bewildered and still sat holding it out And the
Lord has given it to you to take care of these children with see that
you do it And without another word he was gone

Wasnt he good mammy asked Polly after the first surprise was over

Im sure he was said Mrs Pepper Well tie it up again Polly tie
it up tight we shall want it Im sure sighing at her little sick
girl

Maynt I take Phronsie ma asked Polly

No no said Phronsie She had got mammy and she meant to improve the
privilege

What is measles anyway mammy asked Polly sitting down on the
floor at their feet

Oh tis something children always have replied Mrs Pepper but Im
sure I hoped it wouldnt come just yet

I shant have it said Polly decisively I know I shant nor
Bennor Joenornor DavieI guess she added hesitatingly for
Davie was the delicate one of the family at least not nearly so strong
as the others

Mrs Pepper looked at her anxiously but Polly seemed as bright and
healthy as ever as she jumped up and ran to put the kettle on the
stove

Whatll the boys say I wonder she thought to herself feeling
quite important that they really had sickness in the house As long
as Phronsie wasnt dangerous it seemed quite like rich folks and she
forgot the toil and the grind of poverty She looked out from time to
time as she passed the window but no boys came

Ill put her in bed Polly said Mrs Pepper in a whisper as
Phronsie closed her eyes and breathed regularly

And then will you have your dinner ma

Yes said Mrs Pepper I dont careif the boys come

The boysll never come said Polly impatiently I dont
believewhy here they are now

Oh dear said Joel coming in crossly Im so hungryohbutter
whered you get it I thought we never should get here

I thought so too said Polly Hush why wheres Ben

Hes just back began Joel commencing to eat and Davie something
is the matter with Benhe says he feels funny

Something the matter with Ben repeated Polly She dropped the cup she
held which broke in a dozen pieces

Oh whocky cried Joel see what youve done Polly Pepper

But Polly didnt hear over the big flat doorstone she sped and
met Ben with little David coming in the gate His face was just like
Phronsies And with a cold heavy feeling at her heart Polly realized
that this was no play

Oh Ben she cried flinging her arms around his neck and bursting
into tears dont pleaseI wish you wouldnt Phronsies got em and
thats enough

Got what asked Ben while Davies eyes grew to their widest
proportions

Oh measles cried Polly bursting out afresh the hatefullest
horridest measles and now youre taken

Oh no Im not responded Ben cheerfully who knew what measles were
wipe up Polly Im all right only my head aches and my eyes feel
funny

But Polly only halfreassured controlled her sobs and the sorrowful
trio repaired to mother

Oh dear ejaculated Mrs Pepper sinking in a chair in dismay at
sight of Bens red face whateverll we do now

The prop and stay of her life would be taken away if Ben should be laid
aside No more stray half or quarter dollars would come to help her out
when she didnt know where to turn

Polly cleared off the deserted tablefor once Joel had all the bread
and butter he wanted Ben took some of Phronsies medicine and
crawled up into the loft to bed and quiet settled down on the little
household

Polly whispered Ben as she tucked him in itll be hard bucklingto
now for you but I guess youll do it




MORE TROUBLE


Oh dear said Polly to herself the next morning trying to get a
breakfast for the sick ones out of the inevitable mush everythings
just as bad as it can be they cant ever eat this I wish I had an
ocean of toast

Toast some of the bread in the pail Polly said Mrs Pepper

She looked worn and worried she had been up nearly all night back and
forth from Bens bed in the loft to restless fretful little Phronsie in
the big fourposter in the bedroom for Phronsie wouldnt get into the
crib Polly had tried her best to help her and had rubbed her eyes
diligently to keep awake but she was wholly unaccustomed to it and her
healthy tired little body succumbedand then when she awoke shame and
remorse filled her very heart

That isnt nice ma she said glancing at the poor old pail which
she had brought out of the Provision Room Old brown bread I want to
fix em something nice

Well you cant you know said Mrs Pepper with a sigh but youve
got butter now thatll be splendid

I know it said Polly running to the corner cupboard where the
precious morsel in the blue bowl remained whatever should we do
without it mammy

Do without it said Mrs Pepper sames we have done

Well twas splendid in Mrs Henderson to give it to us anyway said
Polly longing for just one taste seems as if twas a year since I
was thereoh ma and here Polly took up the thread that had been so
rudely snapped dont you think shes got ten of the prettiestyes
the sweetest little chickens you ever saw Why cant we have some
mammy

Costs money replied Mrs Pepper Weve got too many in the house to
have any outside

Oh dear said Polly with a red face that was toasting about as much
as the bread she was holding on the point of an old fork we never have
had anything There she added at last thats the best I can do now
Ill put the butter on this little blue plate aint that cunning ma

Yes said Mrs Pepper approvingly it takes you Polly So Polly
trotted first to Ben up the crooked low stairs to the loft and while
she regaled him with the brown toast and butter she kept her tongue
flying on the subject of the little chicks and all that she saw on the
famous Henderson visit Poor Ben pretended hard to eat but ate nothing
really and Polly saw it all and it cut her to the heartso she talked
faster than ever

Now she said starting to go back to Phronsie Ben Pepper just as
soon as you get well well have some chickensso there

Guess we shant get em very soon said Ben despondently if Ive
got to lie here and besides Polly you know every bit we can save has
got to go for the new stove

Oh dear said Polly I forgot that so it has seems to me
everythings giving out

You cant bake any longer in the old thing said Ben turning over and
looking at her poor girl I dont see how youve stood it so long

And weve been stuffing it cried Polly merrily till twont stuff
any more

No said Ben turning back again thats all worn out

Well you must go to sleep said Polly or mammyll be up here and
Phronsie hasnt had her breakfast either

Phronsie was wailing away dismally sitting up in the middle of the old
bed Her face pricked she said and she was rubbing it vigorously with
both fat little hands and then crying worse than ever

Oh me oh my cried Polly how you look Phronsie

I want my mammy cried poor Phronsie

Mammy cant come now Phronsie dear shes sewing See what Pollys got
for youbutter isnt that splendid

Phronsie stopped for just one moment and took a mouthful but the toast
was hard and dry and she cried harder than before

Now said Polly curling up on the bed beside her if youll stop
crying Phronsie Pepper Ill tell you about the cunningest yes the
very cunningest little chickens you ever saw One was white and he
looked just like this said Polly tumbling over on the bed in a heap
he couldnt stand up straight he was so fat

Did he bite asked Phronsie full of interest

No he didnt bite me said Polly but his mother put a bug in his
mouthjust as Im doing you know and she broke off a small piece of
the toast put on a generous bit of butter and held it over Phronsies
mouth

Did he swallow it asked the child obediently opening her little red
lips

Oh snapped it answered Polly quick as ever he could I tell you
but twasnt good like this Phronsie

Did he have two bugs asked Phronsie eying suspiciously the second
morsel of dry toast that Polly was conveying to her mouth

Well he would have had replied Polly if thered been bugs enough
but there were nine other chicks Phronsie

Poor chickies said Phronsie and looked lovingly at the rest of the
toast and butter on the plate and while Polly fed it to her listened
with absorbed interest to all the particulars concerning each and every
chick in the Henderson hencoop

Mother said Polly towards evening Im going to sit up with Ben
tonight say I may do mother

Oh no you cant replied Mrs Pepper youll get worn out and then
what shall I do Joel can hand him his medicine

Oh Joe would tumble to sleep mammy said Polly the first
thinglet me

Perhaps Phronsiell let me go tonight said Mrs Pepper
reflectively

Oh no she wont I know replied Polly decisively she wants you
all the time

I will Polly said Davie coming in with an armful of wood in time
to hear the conversation Ill give him his medicine maynt I mammy
and David let down his load and came over where his mother and Polly
sat sewing to urge his rights

I dont know said his mother smiling on him Can you do you
think

Yes maam said Davie straightening himself up

When they told Ben he said he knew a better way than for Davie to
watch hed have a string tied to Davies arm and the end hed hold in
bed and when twas time for medicine hed pull the string and that
would wake Davie up

Polly didnt sleep much more on her shakedown on the floor than if she
had watched with Ben for Phronsie cried and moaned and wanted a drink
of water every two minutes it seemed to her As she went back into her
nest after one of these travels Polly thought Well I dont care if
nobody else gets sick if Benll only get well Tomorrow Im goin to
do mammys sack shes begun for Mr Jackson its all plain sewin
just like a bag and I can do it I know and so she fell into a
troubled sleep only to be awakened by Phronsies fretful little voice
I want a drink of water Polly I do

Dont she drink awfully mammy asked Polly after one of these
excursions out to the kitchen after the necessary draught

Yes said Mrs Pepper and she mustnt have any more twill hurt
her But Phronsie fell into a delicious sleep after that and didnt
want any more luckily

Here Joe said Mrs Pepper the next morning take this coat up to
Mr Peterses and be sure you get the money for it

Howll I get it asked Joe who didnt relish the long hot walk

Why tell em were sickBens sick added Mrs Pepper as the most
decisive thing and we must have it and then wait for it

Tisnt pleasant up at the Peterses grumbled Joel taking the parcel
and moving slowly off

No no Polly said Mrs Pepper you neednt do that seeing
Polly take up some sewing after doing up the room and finishing the
semiweekly bake youre all beat out with that tussle over the stove
that sackll have to go till next week

It cant mammy said Polly snipping off a basting thread weve got
to have the money how muchll he give you for it

Thirty cents replied Mrs Pepper

Well said Polly weve got to get all the thirty centses we can
mammy dear and I know I can do it trulytry me once she implored

Well Mrs Pepper relented slowly

Dont feel bad mammy dear comforted Polly sewing away briskly
Benll get well pretty soon and then well be all right

Maybe said Mrs Pepper and went back to Phronsie who could scarcely
let her out of her sight

Polly stitched away bravely Now if I do this good mammyll let me do
it other times she said to herself

Davie too worked patiently out of doors trying to do Bens chores
The little fellow blundered over things that Ben would have accomplished
in half the time and he had to sit down often on the steps of the
little old shed where the tools were kept to wipe his hot face and
rest

Polly said Mrs Pepper hadnt you better stop a little Dear me
how fast you sew child

Polly gave a delighted little hum at her mothers evident approval

Im going to do em all next week mammy she said then Mr Atkins
wont take em away from us I guess

Mr Atkins kept the store and gave out coats and sacks of coarse linen
and homespun to Mrs Pepper to make and it was the fear of losing the
work that had made the mothers heart sink

I dont believe anybodys got such children as I have she said and
she gave Polly a motherly little pat that the little daughter felt clear
to the tips of her toes with a thrill of delight

About halfpast two long after dinner Joe came walking in hungry as a
beaver but flushed and triumphant

Why where have you been all this time asked his mother

Oh Joe you didnt stop to play asked Polly from her perch where
she sat sewing giving him a reproachful glance

Stop to play retorted Joe indignantly no I guess I didnt Ive
been to Old Peterses

Not all this time exclaimed Mrs Pepper

Yes I have too replied Joel sturdily marching up to her And
theres your money mother and he counted out a quarter of a dollar
in silver pieces and pennies which he took from a dingy wad of paper
stowed away in the depths of his pocket

Oh Joe said Mrs Pepper sinking back in her chair and looking at
him what do you mean

Polly put her work in her lap and waited to hear

Wheres my dinner Polly asked Joel I hope its a big one

Yes tis said Polly youve got lots today its in the corner of
the cupboard covered up with the plateso tell on Joe

Thats elegant said Joel coming back with the wellfilled plate
Bens and his own share

Do tell us Joey implored Polly mothers waiting

Well said Joel his mouth half full I waitedand he said the coat
was all rightandandMrs Peters said twas all rightand Mirandy
Peters said twas all right but they didnt any of em say anythin
about payin so I didnt think twas all rightandandcant I have
some more butter Polly

No said Polly sorry to refuse him hed been so good about the
money the butters got to be saved for Ben and Phronsie

Oh said Joe I wish Miss Henderson would send us some more I do I
think she might

For shame Joe said Mrs Pepper she was very good to send this I
think now what else did you say she asked

Well said Joel taking another mouthful of bread so I waited you
told me to mother you knowand they all went to work and they didnt
mind me at all andthere wasnt anything to look at so I satand
satPolly cant I have some gingerbread

No said Polly its all gone I gave the last piece to Phronsie the
day she was taken sick

Oh dear said Joel everythings gone

Well do go on Joe do

Andthen they had dinner and Mr Peters said Hasnt that boy gone
home yet and Mrs Peters said noand he called me in and asked me
why I didnt run along home and I said Phronsie was sick and Ben had
the squeezles

The what said Polly

The squeezles repeated Joel irritably thats what you said

Its measles Joey corrected Mrs Pepper never mind I wouldnt
feel bad

Well they all laughed and laughed and then I said you told me to
wait till I did get the money

Oh Joe began Mrs Pepper you shouldnt have told em sowhat did
he say

Well he laughed and said I was a smart boy and hed see and Mirandy
said do pay him pa he must be tired to deathand dont you think
he went to a big desk in the corner and took out a box and twas full
most of moneylots oh and he gave me mineandthats all and Im
tired to death And Joel flung himself down on the floor expanded his
legs as only Joel could and took a comfortable roll

So you must be said Polly pityingly waiting at those Peterses

Dont ever want to see any more Peterses said Joel never never
never

Oh dear thought Polly as she sewed on into the afternoon I wonder
what does all my eyes feels just like sand in em and she rubbed and
rubbed to thread her needle But she was afraid her mother would see
so she kept at her sewing Once in awhile the bad feeling would go away
and then she would forget all about it There now who says I cant do
it thats most done she cried jumping up and spinning across the
room to stretch herself a bit and tomorrow Ill finish it

Well said Mrs Pepper if you can do that Polly youll be the
greatest help Ive had yet

So Polly tucked herself into the old shakedown with a thankful heart
that night hoping for morning

Alas when morning did come Polly could hardly move The measles what
should she do A faint hope of driving them off made her tumble out
of bed and stagger across the room to look in the old cracked
lookingglass All hope was gone as the red reflection met her gaze
Polly was on the sick list now

I wont be sick she said at any rate Ill keep around An awful
feeling made her clutch the back of a chair but she managed somehow to
get into her clothes and go groping blindly into the kitchen Somehow
Polly couldnt see very well She tried to set the table but twas no
use Oh dear she thought whateverll mammy do

Hulloa said Joel coming in whats the matter Polly Polly
started at his sudden entrance and wavering a minute fell over in a
heap

Oh ma ma screamed Joel running to the foot of the stairs leading to
the loft where Mrs Pepper was with Ben somethings taken Polly and
she fell and I guess shes in the woodbox




HARD DAYS FOR POLLY


Ma said David coming softly into the bedroom where poor Polly
lay on the bed with Phronsie her eyes bandaged with a soft old
handkerchief Ill set the table

There isnt any table to set said Mrs Pepper sadly there isnt
anybody to eat anything Davie you and Joel can get something out of
the cupboard

Can we get whatever weve a mind to ma cried Joel who followed
Davie rubbing his face with a towel after his morning ablutions

Yes replied his mother absently

Come on Dave cried Joel well have a breakfast

We mustnt said little Davie doubtfully eat the whole Joey

But that individual already had his head in the cupboard which soon
engrossed them both

Dr Fisher was called in the middle of the morning to see what was the
matter with Pollys eyes The little man looked at her keenly over his
spectacles then he said When were you taken

This morning answered Polly her eyes smarting

Didnt you feel badly before questioned the doctor Polly thought
back and then she remembered that she had felt very badly that when
she was baking over the old stove the day before her back had ached
dreadfully and that somehow when she sat down to sew it didnt stop
only her eyes had bothered her so she didnt mind her back so much

I thought so said the doctor when Polly answered And those eyes
of yours have been used too much what has she been doing maam He
turned around sharply on Mrs Pepper as he asked this

Sewing said Mrs Pepper and everything Polly does everything
sir

Humph said the doctor well she wont again in one spell her eyes
are very bad

At this a whoop small but terrible to hear came from the middle of the
bed and Phronsie sat bolt upright Everybody started while Phronsie
broke out Dont make my Polly sick oh please dont

Hey said the doctor and he looked kindly at the small object with
a very red face in the middle of the bed Then he added gently Were
going to make Polly well little girl so that she can see splendidly

Will you really asked the child doubtfully

Yes said the doctor well try hard and you mustnt cry cause
then Pollyll cry and that will make her eyes very bad very bad
indeed he repeated impressively

I wont cry said Phronsie no not one bit And she wiped off the
last tear with her fat little hand and watched to see what next was to
be done


And Polly was left very rebellious indeed in the big bed with a
cooling lotion on the poor eyes that somehow didnt cool them one bit

If twas anythin but my eyes mammy I could stand it she bewailed
flouncing over and over in her impatience and wholl do all the work
now

Dont think of the work Polly said Mrs Pepper

I cant do anything but think said poor Polly

Just at that moment a queer noise out in the kitchen was heard

Do go out mother and see what tis said Polly

Ive come said a cracked voice close up by the bedroom door
followed by a big black cap which could belong to no other than Grandma
Bascom to set by you a spell whats the matter she asked and
stopped amazed to see Polly in bed

Oh Pollys taken screamed Mrs Pepper in her ear

Taken repeated the old lady what is ita fit

No said Mrs Pepper the same as Bens got and Phronsie the
measles

The measles has she said grandma well thats bad and Bens away
you say

No he isnt either screamed Mrs Pepper hes got them too

Got two what asked grandma

Measles hes got the measles too repeated Mrs Pepper loud as she
could so loud that the old ladys cap trembled at the noise

Oh the dreadful said grandma and this girl too laying her hand
on Phronsies head

Yes said Mrs Pepper feeling it a little relief to tell over her
miseries all three of them

I havent said Joel coming in in hopes that grandma had a stray
peppermint or two in her pocket as she sometimes did and Im not
going to either

Oh dear groaned his mother thats what Polly said and shes
got em bad Its her eyes she screamed to grandma who looked
inquiringly

Her eyes is it asked Mrs Bascom well Ive got a receet that
cousin Samanthys folks had when Johns children had em and Ill run
right along home and get it and she started to go

No you neednt screamed Mrs Pepper thank you Mrs Bascom but
Dr Fishers been here and he put something on Pollys eyes and he
said it mustnt be touched

Hey said the old lady so Mrs Pepper had to go all over it again
till at last she made her understand that Pollys eyes were taken care
of and they must wait for time to do the rest

You come along of me whispered grandma when at last her call was
done to Joel who stood by the door Ive got some peppermints to home
I forgot to bring em

Yesm said Joel brightening up

Where you going Joe asked Mrs Pepper seeing him move off with Mrs
Bascom I may want you

Oh Ive got to go over to grandmas said Joel briskly she wants
me

Well dont be gone long then replied his mother

There said grandma going into her keepingroom to an oldfashioned
chest of drawers opening one she took therefrom a paper from which
she shook out before Joes delighted eyes some red and white peppermint
drops There now you take these home you may have some but be
sure you give the most to the sick ones and Pollylet Polly have the
biggest

She wont take em said Joel wishing he had the measles Well you
try her said grandma run along now But it was useless to tell Joel
that for he was halfway home already He carried out grandmas wishes
and distributed conscientiously the precious drops But when he came to
Polly she didnt answer and looking at her in surprise he saw two big
tears rolling out under the bandage and wetting the pillow

I dont want em Joe said Polly when he made her understand that
twas peppermints real peppermints you may have em

Try one Polly theyre real good said Joel who had an undefined
wish to comfort there open your mouth

So Polly opened her mouth and Joel put one in with satisfaction

Isnt it good he asked watching her crunch it

Yes said Polly real good whered you get em

Over to Grandma Bascoms said Joel she gave me lots for all of us
have another Polly

No said Polly not yet you put two on my pillow where I can reach
em and then you keep the rest Joel

Ill put three said Joel counting out one red and two white ones
and laying them on the pillow there

And I want another Joey I do said Phronsie from the other side of
the bed

Well you may have one said Joel a red one Phronsie yes you may
have two Now come on Dave well have the rest out by the woodpile

How they ever got through that day I dont know But late in the
afternoon carriage wheels were heard and then they stopped right at the
Peppers little brown gate

Polly said Mrs Pepper running to the bedroom door its Mrs
Henderson

Is it said Polly from the darkened room oh Im so glad is Miss
Jerushy with her she asked fearfully

No said Mrs Pepper going back to ascertain why its the parson
himself Deary how we look

Never mind mammy called back Polly longing to spring out of bed and
fix up a bit

Im sorry to hear the children are sick said Mrs Henderson coming
in in her sweet gentle way

We didnt know it said the minister until this morningcan we see
them

Oh yes sir said Mrs Pepper Bens upstairs and Polly and Phronsie
are in here

Poor little things said Mrs Henderson compassionately hadnt you
better turning to the minister go up and see Ben first while I will
visit the little girls

So the minister mounted the crooked stairs and Mrs Henderson went
straight up to Pollys side and the first thing Polly knew a cool
gentle hand was laid on her hot head and a voice said Ive come to
see my little chicken now

Oh maam said Polly bursting into a sob I dont care about my
eyesonly mammy and she broke right down

I know said the ministers wife soothingly but its for you to
bear patiently Pollywhat do you suppose the chicks were doing when I
came away And Mrs Henderson while she held Pollys hand smiled and
nodded encouragingly to Phronsie who was staring at her from the other
side of the bed

I dont know maam said Polly please tell us

Well they were all fighting over a grasshopperyes ten of them

Which one got it asked Polly in intense interest oh I hope the
white one did

Well he looked as much like winning as any of them said the lady
laughing

Bless her thought Mrs Pepper to herself out in the kitchen
finishing the sack Polly had left shes a parsons wife I say

And then the minister came down from Bens room and went into the
bedroom and Mrs Henderson went upstairs into the loft

So he said kindly as after patting Phronsies head he came over and
sat down by Polly this is the little girl who came to see me when I
was sick

Oh sir said Polly Im so glad you wasnt

Well when I come again said Mr Henderson rising after a merry
chat I see I shall have to slip a book into my pocket and read for
those poor eyes

Oh thank you cried Polly and then she stopped and blushed

Well what is it asked the minister encouragingly

Ben loves to hear reading said Polly

Does he well by that time my little girl I guess Ben will be
downstairs hes all right Polly dont you worry about himand Ill
sit in the kitchen by the bedroom door and you can hear nicely

So the Hendersons went away But somehow before they went a good many
things found their way out of the oldfashioned chaise into the Peppers
little kitchen

But Pollys eyes didnt get any better with all the care and the lines
of worry on Mrs Peppers face grew deeper and deeper At last she just
confronted Dr Fisher in the kitchen one day after his visit to Polly
and boldly asked him if they ever could be cured I know shesand
there isnt any use keeping it from me said the poor womanshes
going to be stoneblind

My good woman Dr Fishers voice was very gentle and he took the
hard brown hand in his ownyour little girl will not be blind I
tell you the truth but it will take some time to make her eyes quite
strongtime and rest She has strained them in some way but she will
come out of it

Praise the Lord cried Mrs Pepper throwing her apron over her
head and then she sobbed on and thank you sirI cant ever thank
youforforif Polly was blind we might as well give up

The next day Phronsie who had the doctors permission to sit up only
she was to be kept from taking cold scampered around in stockingfeet
in search of her shoes which she hadnt seen since she was first taken
sick

Oh I want on my very best shoes she cried cant I mammy

Oh no Phronsie you must keep them nice remonstrated her mother
you cant wear em everyday you know

Tisnt everyday said Phronsie slowly its only one day

Well and then youll want em on again tomorrow said her mother

Oh no I wont cried Phronsie never no more tomorrow if I can
have em today please mammy dear

Mrs Pepper went to the lowest drawer in the high bureau and took
therefrom a small parcel done up in white tissue paper Slowly unrolling
this before the delighted eyes of the child who stood patiently
waiting she disclosed the precious redtopped shoes which Phronsie
immediately clasped to her bosom

My own very own shoes whole mine she cried and trudged out into
the kitchen to put them on herself

Hulloa cried Dr Fisher coming in about a quarter of an hour later
to find her tugging laboriously at the buttonsnew shoes I declare

My own cried Phronsie sticking out one foot for inspection where
every button was in the wrong buttonhole and theyve got red tops
too

So they have said the doctor getting down on the floor beside her
beautiful red tops arent they

Beyewtiful sang the child delightedly

Does Polly have new shoes every day asked the doctor in a low voice
pretending to examine the other foot

Phronsie opened her eyes very wide at this

Oh no she dont have anything Polly dont

And what does Polly want most of alldo you know see if you can tell
me And the doctor put on the most alluring expression that he could
muster

Oh I know cried Phronsie with a very wise look There now cried
the doctor youre the girl for me to think you know so what is it

Phronsie got up very gravely and with one shoe half on she leaned over
and whispered in the doctors ear

A stove

A what said the doctor looking at her and then at the old black
thing in the corner that looked as if it were ashamed of itself why
shes got one

Oh said the child it wont burn and sometimes Polly cries she
does when shes all aloneand I see her

Now said the doctor very sympathetically thats too bad that is
and then what does she do

Oh Ben stuffs it up said the child laughing and so does Polly
too with paper and then it all tumbles out quick oh just as quick
And Phronsie shook her yellow head at the dismal remembrance

Do you suppose said the doctor getting up that you know of any
smart little girl around here about four years old and that knows how
to button on her own redtopped shoes that would like to go to ride
tomorrow morning in my carriage with me

Oh I do cried Phronsie hopping on one toe its me

Very well then said Dr Fisher going to the bedroom door well
lookout for tomorrow then

To poor Polly lying in the darkened room or sitting up in the big
rockingchairfor Polly wasnt really very sick in other respects
the disease having all gone into the merry brown eyesthe time seemed
interminable Not to do anything The very idea at any time would have
filled her active wideawake little body with horror and now here she
was

Oh dear I cant bear it she said when she knew by the noise in the
kitchen that everybody was out there so nobody heard except a fat old
black spider in the corner and he didnt tell anyone

I know its a week she said since dinnertime If Ben were only
well to talk to me

Oh I say Polly screamed Joel at that moment running in Bens
acomin down the stairs

Stop Joe said Mrs Pepper you shouldnt have told he wanted to
surprise Polly

Oh is he cried Polly clasping her hands in rapture mammy cant I
take off this horrid bandage and see him

Dear me no said Mrs Pepper springing forward not for the world
Polly Dr Fisherd have our ears off

Well I can hear any way said Polly resigning herself to the
remaining comfort here he is oh Ben

There said Ben grasping Polly bandage and all now were all
right and say Polly youre a brick

Mammy told me not to say that the other day said Joel with a very
virtuous air

Cant help it said Ben who was a little wild over Polly and
besides he had been sick himself and had borne a good deal too

Now said Mrs Pepper after the first excitement was over youre
so comfortable together and Phronsie dont want me now Ill go to the
store I must get some more work if Mr Atkinsll give it to me

Ill be all right now mammy that Bens here cried Polly settling
back into her chair with Phronsie on the stool at her feet

Im goin to tell her stories ma cried Ben so you neednt worry
about us

Isnt it funny Ben said Polly as the gate clicked after the mother
to be sitting still and telling stories in the daytime

Rather funny replied Ben

Well do go on said Joel as usual rolling on the floor in a
dreadful hurry for the story to begin Little David looked up quietly
as he sat on Bens other side his hands clasped tight together just as
eager though he said nothing

Well once upon a time began Ben delightfully and launched into one
of the stories that the children thought perfectly lovely

Oh Bensie cried Polly entranced as they listened with bated
breath however do you think of such nice things

Ive had time enough to think the last week said Ben laughing to
last a lifetime

Do go on put in Joel impatient at the delay

Dont hurry him so said Polly reprovingly he isnt strong

Ben said David drawing a long breath his eyes very big did he
really see a bear

No said Ben oh where was I

Why you said Tommy heard a noise said Polly and he thought it was
a bear

Oh yes said Ben I remember twasnt a

Oh make it a bear Ben cried Joel terribly disappointed dont let
it be not a bear

Why I cant said Ben twouldnt sound true

Never mind make it sound true insisted Joel you can make anything
true

Very well said Ben laughing I suppose I must

Make it two bears Ben begged little Phronsie

Oh no Phronsie thats too much cried Joel thatll spoil it but
make it a big bear do Ben and have him bite him somewhere and most
kill him

Oh Joel cried Polly while Davids eyes got bigger than ever

So Ben drew upon his powers as storyteller to suit his exacting
audience and was making his bear work havoc upon poor Tommy in a way
captivating to all even Joel when Well I declare sounded Mrs
Peppers cheery voice coming in upon them if this isnt comfortable

Oh mammy cried Phronsie jumping out of Pollys arms whither she
had taken refuge during the thrilling tale and running to her mother
who gathered her baby up weve had a bear a real live bear we have
Ben made him

Have you said Mrs Pepper taking off her shawl and laying her
parcel of work down on the table now thats nice

Oh mammy cried Polly it does seem so good to be all together
again

And I thank the Lord said Mrs Pepper looking down on her happy
little group and the tears were in her eyesand children we ought to
be very good and please Him for Hes been so good to us




THE CLOUD OVER THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE


When Phronsie with many crows of delight and much chattering had
gotten fairly started the following morning on her muchanticipated
drive with the doctor the whole family excepting Polly drawn up around
the door to see them off Mrs Pepper resolved to snatch the time and
run down for an hour or two to one of her customers who had long been
waiting for a little tailoring to be done for her boys

Now Joel she said putting on her bonnet before the cracked
lookingglass you stay along of Polly Ben must go up to bed the
doctor said and Davies going to the store for some molasses so you
and Polly must keep house

Yesm said Joel may I have somethin to eat ma

Yes said Mrs Pepper but dont you eat the new bread you may have
as much as you want of the old

Isnt there any molasses mammy asked Joel as she bade Polly
goodbye and gave her numberless charges to be careful of your eyes
and not to let a crack of light in through the curtain as the old
green paper shade was called

No if youre very hungry you can eat bread said Mrs Pepper
sensibly

Joel said Polly after the mother had gone I do wish you could read
to me

Well I cant said Joel glad he didnt know how I thought the
minister was comin

Well he was said Polly but mammy said he had to go out of town to
a consequence

A what asked Joel very much impressed

A con repeated Polly Well it began with a conand I am
sureyes very sure it was consequence

That must be splendid said Joel coming up to her chair and
slowly drawing a string he held in his hand back and forth to go to
consequences and everything When Im a man Polly Pepper Im going to
be a minister and have a nice time and gojust everywhere

Oh Joel exclaimed Polly quite shocked you couldnt be one you
arent good enough

I dont care said Joel not at all dashed by her plainness Ill be
good thenwhen Im a big man dont you suppose Polly as a new idea
struck him that Mr Henderson ever is naughty

No said Polly very decidedly never never never

Then I dont want to be one said Joel veering round with a sigh of
relief and besides Id rather have a pair of horses like Mr Slocums
and then I could go everywheres I guess

And sell tin asked Polly just like Mr Slocum

Yes said Joel this is the way Id goGeewhop geewhoa and Joel
pranced with his imaginary steeds all around the room making about as
much noise as any other four boys as he brought up occasionally against
the fourposter or the high old bureau

Well said a voice close up by Pollys chair that made her skip with
apprehension it was so like Miss Jerusha HendersonsJoel was whooping
away behind the bedstead to his horses that had become seriously
entangled so he didnt hear anything But when Polly said bashfully
I cant see anything maam he came up red and shining to the
surface and stared with all his might

I came to see you little girl said Miss Jerusha severely seating
herself stiffly by Pollys side

Thank you maam said Polly faintly

Whos this boy asked the lady turning around squarely on Joel and
eying him from head to foot

Hes my brother Joel said Polly

Joel still stared

Which brother pursued Miss Jerusha like a censustaker

He is next to me said Polly wishing her mother was home hes nine
Joel is

Hes big enough to do something to help his mother said Miss
Jerusha looking him through and through Dont you think you might do
something when the others are sick and your poor mother is working so
hard she continued in a cold voice

I do something blurted out Joel sturdily lots and lots

You shouldnt say lots reproved Miss Jerusha with a sharp look over
her spectacles tisnt proper for boys to talk so what do you do all
day long she asked turning back to Polly after a withering glance at
Joel who still stared

I cant do anything maam replied Polly sadly I cant see to do
anything

Well you might knit I should think said her visitor its dreadful
for a girl as big as you are to sit all day idle I had sore eyes once
when I was a little girlhow old are you she asked abruptly

Eleven last month said Polly

Well I wasnt only nine when I knit a stocking and I had sore eyes
too you see I was a very little girl and

Was you ever little interrupted Joel in extreme incredulity drawing
near and looking over the big square figure

Hey said Miss Jerusha so Joel repeated his question before Polly
could stop him

Of course answered Miss Jerusha and then she added tartly little
boys shouldnt speak unless theyre spoken to Now and she turned back
to Polly again didnt you ever knit a stocking

No maam said Polly not a whole one

Dear me exclaimed Miss Jerusha did I ever And she raised her
black mitts in intense disdain A big girl like you never to knit a
stocking to think your mother should bring you up so and

She didnt bring us up screamed Joel in indignation facing her with
blazing eyes

Joel said Polly be still

And youre very impertinent too said Miss Jerusha a good child
never is impertinent

Polly sat quite still and Miss Jerusha continued

Now I hope you will learn to be industrious and when I come again I
will see what you have done

You arent ever coming again said Joel defiantly no never

Joel implored Polly and in her distress she pulled up her bandage
as she looked at him you know mammyll be so sorry at you Oh maam
and she turned to Miss Jerusha who was now thoroughly aroused to the
duty she saw before her of doing these children good I dont know what
is the reason maam Joel never talks so hes real good and

It only shows said the lady seeing her way quite clear for a little
exhortation that youve all had your own way from infancy and that
you dont do what you might to make your mothers life a happy one

Oh maam cried Polly and she burst into a flood of tears please
please dont say that

And I say screamed Joel stamping his small foot if you make Polly
cry youll kill her Dont Polly dont and the boy put both arms
around her neck and soothed and comforted her in every way he could
think of And Miss Jerusha seeing no way to make herself heard
disappeared feeling pity for children who would turn away from good
advice

But still Polly cried on all the pentup feelings that had been so long
controlled had free vent now She really couldnt stop Joel frightened
to death at last said Im going to wake up Ben

That brought Polly to and she sobbed out Oh no JoeyIll stop

I will said Joel seeing his advantage Im going Polly and he
started to the foot of the stairs

No Im done now Joe said Polly wiping her eyes and choking back
her thoughtsoh Joe I must scream my eyes aches so and poor Polly
fairly writhed all over the chair

Whatll I do said Joel at his wits end running back do you want
some water

Oh no gasped Polly doctor wouldnt let me oh I wish mammyd
come

Ill go and look for her suggested Joel feeling as if he must do
something and hed rather be out at the gate than to see Polly suffer

That wont bring her said Polly trying to keep still Ill try to
wait

Here she is now cried Joel peeping out of the window oh goody




JOELS TURN


Well Mrs Peppers tone was unusually blithe as she stepped into the
kitchenyouve had a nice time I supposewhat in the world and she
stopped at the bedroom door

Oh mammy if youd been here said Joel while Polly sat still only
holding on to her eyes as if they were going to fly out theres been
a big woman here she came right inand she talked awfully and Pollys
been acryin and her eyes ache dreadfullyand

Been crying repeated Mrs Pepper coming up to poor Polly Polly
been crying she still repeated

Oh mammy I couldnt help it said Polly she said and in spite
of all she could do the rain of tears began again which bade fair to
be as uncontrolled as before But Mrs Pepper took her up firmly in her
arms as if she were Phronsie and sat down in the old rockingchair and
just patted her back

There there she whispered soothingly dont think of it Polly
mothers got home

Oh mammy said Polly crawling up to the comfortable neck for
protection I ought not to mind but twas Miss Jerusha Henderson and
she said

What did she say asked Mrs Pepper thinking perhaps it to be the
wiser thing to let Polly free her mind

Oh she said that we ought to be doing something and I ought to knit
and

Go on said her mother

And then Joel got naughty oh mammy he never did so before and I
couldnt stop him cried Polly in great distress I really couldnt
mammyand he talked to her and he told her she wasnt ever coming here
again

Joel shouldnt have said that said Mrs Pepper and under her breath
something was added that Polly even failed to hearbut no more she
isnt

And mammy cried Pollyand she flung her arms around her mothers
neck and gave her a grasp that nearly choked Mrs Pepper aint I
helpin you some mammy Oh I wish I could do something big for you
Aint you happy mammy

For the lands sakes cried Mrs Pepper straining Polly to her heart
whatever has that womanwhatever could she have said to you Such a
girl as you are too cried Mrs Pepper hugging Polly and covering
her with kisses so tender that Polly warmed and cuddled up to her
hearts content was comforted to the full

Well said Mrs Pepper when at last she thought she had formed
between Polly and Joel about the right idea of the visit well now we
wont think of it ever any more tisnt worth it Polly you know

But poor Polly and poor mother They both were obliged to think of it
Nothing could avert the suffering of the next few days caused by that
long flow of burning tears

Nothing feels good on em mammy said Polly at last twisting her
hands in the vain attempt to keep from rubbing the aching inflamed eyes
that drove her nearly wild with their itching there isnt any use in
trying anything

There will be use energetically protested Mrs Pepper bringing
another cool bandage as long as youve got an eye in your head Polly
Pepper

Dr Fishers face when he first saw the change that the fateful visit
had wrought and heard the accounts was very grave indeed Everything
had been so encouraging on his last visit that he had come very near
promising Polly speedy freedom from the hateful bandage

But the little Pepper household soon had something else to think of more
important even than Pollys eyes for now the heartiest the jolliest
of all the little group was downJoel How he fell sick they scarcely
knew it all came so suddenly The poor bewildered family had hardly
time to think before delirium and perhaps death stared them in the
face

When Polly first heard it by Phronsies pattering downstairs and
screaming Oh Polly Joeys dreadful sick he is she jumped right
up and tore off the bandage

Now I will help mother I will so there and in another minute she
would have been up in the sick room But the first thing she knew a
gentle but firm hand was laid upon hers and she found herself back
again in the old rockingchair and listening to the Doctors words
which were quite stern and decisive

Now I tell you he said you must not take off that bandage again
do you know the consequences You will be blind and then you will be a
care to your mother all your life

I shall be blind anyway said Polly despairingly so twont make
any difference

No your eyes will come out of it all right only I did hope and the
good doctors face fellthat the other two boys would escape but
and he brightened up at sight of Pollys forlorn visagesee you do
your part by keeping still

But there came a day soon when everything was still around the once
happy little brown housewhen only whispers were heard from white lips
and thoughts were fearfully left unuttered

On the morning of one of these days when Mrs Pepper felt she could not
exist an hour longer without sleep kind Mrs Beebe came to stay until
things were either better or worse

Still the cloud hovered dark and forbidding At last one afternoon
when Polly was all alone she could endure it no longer She flung
herself down by the side of the old bed and buried her face in the gay
patched bedquilt

Dear God she said make me willing to have anything she
hesitatedyes anything happen to be blind forever and to have Joey
sick only make me good

How long she staid there she never knew for she fell asleepthe first
sleep she had had since Joey was taken sick And little Mrs Beebe
coming in found her thus

Polly the good woman said leaning over her you poor pretty
creeter you Im goin to tell you somethinthere there just to
think Joels goin to get well

Oh Mrs Beebe cried Polly tumbling over in a heap on the floor her
face as much as could be seen under the bandage in a perfect glow Is
he really

Yes to be sure the dangers all over now said the little old lady
inwardly thinkingIf I hadnt acome

Well then the Lord wants him to cried Polly in rapture dont he
Mrs Beebe

To be sureto be sure repeated the kind friend only half
understanding

Well I dont care about my eyes then cried Polly and to Mrs
Beebes intense astonishment and dismay she spun round and round in the
middle of the floor

Oh Polly Polly the little old lady cried running up to her do
stop the doctor wouldnt let you he wouldnt really you know itll
all go to your eyes

I dont care repeated Polly in the middle of a spin but she
stopped obediently seems as if I just as soon be blind as not its so
beautiful Joeys going to get well




SUNSHINE AGAIN


But as Joel was smitten down suddenly so he came up quickly and his
hearty nature asserted itself by rapid strides toward returning health
and one morning he astonished them all by turning over suddenly and
exclaiming

I want something to eat

Bless the Lord cried Mrs Pepper now hes going to live

But he mustnt eat protested Mrs Beebe in great alarm trotting for
the cup of gruel Here you pretty creeter you heres something nice
And she temptingly held the spoon over Joels mouth but with a grimace
he turned away

Oh I want something to eat some gingerbread or some bread and
butter

Dear me ejaculated Mrs Beebe Gingerbread Poor Mrs Pepper saw
the hardest part of her trouble now before her as she realized that the
returning appetite must be fed only on strengthening food for where it
was to come from she couldnt tell

The Lord only knows where well get it she groaned within herself

Yes He knew A rap at the door and little David ran down to find the
cause

Oh mammy he said Mrs Henderson sent itsee see And in the
greatest excitement he placed in her lap a basket that smelt savory and
nice even before it was opened When it was opened there lay a little
bird delicately roasted and folded in a clean napkin also a glass of
jelly crimson and clear

Oh Joey cried Mrs Pepper almost overwhelmed with joy see what
Mrs Henderson sent you now you can eat fit for a king

That little bird certainly performed its mission in life for as Mrs
Beebe said It just touched the spot and from that very moment Joel
improved so rapidly they could hardly believe their eyes

Hoh I havent been sick he cried on the third day true to his
nature Mammy I want to get up

Oh dear no you mustnt Joel cried Mrs Pepper in a fright
running up to him as he was preparing to give the bedclothes a lusty
kick youll send em in

Send what in asked Joel looking up at his mother in terror as the
dreadful thought made him pause

Why the measles Joey theyll all go in if you get out

How they goin to get in again Id like to know asked Joel looking
at the little red spots on his hands in incredulity say ma

Well they will said his mother as youll find to your sorrow if
you get out of bed

Oh dear said Joel beginning to whimper as he drew into bed again
when can I get up mammy

Oh in a day or two responded Mrs Pepper cheerfully youre
getting on so finely youll be as smart as a cricket Shouldnt you
say he might get up in a day or two Mrs Beebe she appealed to that
individual who was knitting away cheerily in the corner

Well if he keeps on as hes begun I shouldnt know what to think
replied Mrs Beebe It beats all how quick hes picked up I never see
anything like it Im sure

And as Mrs Beebe was a great authority in sickness the old sunny
cheeriness began to creep into the brown house once more and to bubble
over as of yore

Seems as if twas just good to live said Mrs Pepper thankfully
once when her thoughts were too much for her I dont believe I shall
ever care how poor we are she continued as long as were together

And thats just what the Lord meant maybe replied good Mrs Beebe
who was preparing to go home

Joel kept the house in a perfect uproar all through his getting well
Mrs Pepper observed one day when he had been more turbulent than
usual that she was almost worn to a thread

Twasnt anything to take care of you Joe she added when you were
real sick because then I knew where you were butwell you wont ever
have the measles again I spose and thats some comfort

Little David who had been nearly stunned by the sickness that had laid
aside his almost constant companion could express his satisfaction and
joy in no other way than by running every third minute and begging to do
something for him And Joel who loved dearly to be waited on improved
every opportunity that offered which Mrs Pepper observing soon put a
stop to

Youll run his legs off Joel at last she said when he sent David
the third time down to the woodpile for a stick of just the exact
thickness and which the little messenger declared wasnt to be found
Havent you any mercy Youve kept him going all day too she added
glancing at Davids pale face

Oh mammy panted David dont I love to go Here Joe is the best I
could find handing him a nice smooth stick

I know you do said his mother but Joes getting better now and he
must learn to spare you

I dont want to spare folks grumbled Joel whittling away with
energy Ive been sickreal sick he added lifting his chubby face
to his mother to impress the fact

I know you have she cried running to kiss her boy but now Joe
youre most well Tomorrow Im going to let you go downstairs what do
you think of that

Hooray screamed Joel throwing away the stick and clapping his hands
forgetting all about his serious illness thatll be prime

Arent you too sick to go Joey asked Mrs Pepper mischievously

No Im not sick cried Joel in the greatest alarm fearful his
mother meant to take back the promise Ive never been sick Oh mammy
you know youll let me go wont your

I guess so laughed his mother

Come on Phron cried Joel giving her a whirl

David who was too tired for active sport sat on the floor and watched
them frolic in great delight

Mammy said he edging up to her side as the sport went on do you
know I think its just gooditsoh its so frisky since Joe got
well isnt it mammy

Yes indeed said Mrs Pepper giving him a radiant look in return for
his and when Pollys around again with her two eyes all rightwell I
dont know what we shall do I declare

Boo cried a voice next morning close to Pollys elbow unmistakably
Joels

Oh Joel Pepper she cried whirling around is that really you

Yes cried that individual confidently its I oh I say Polly
Ive had fun upstairs I tell you what

Poor boy said Polly compassionately

I wasnt a poor boy cried Joel indignantly I had splendid things
to eat oh my and he closed one eye and smacked his lips in the
delightful memory

I know it said Polly and Im so glad Joel

I dont suppose Ill ever get so many again observed Joel
reflectively after a minutes pause as one and another of the wondrous
delicacies rose before his minds eye not unless I have the measles
againsay Polly cant I have em again

Mercy no cried Polly in intense alarm I hope not

Well I dont said Joel I wish I could have em sixtynotwo
hundred times so there

Well mammy couldnt take care of you said Ben you dont know what
youre sayin Joe

Well then I wish I could have the things without the measles said
Joel willing to accommodate only folks wont send em he added in
an injured tone

Pollys had the hardest time of all said her mother affectionately
patting the bandage

I think so too put in Ben if my eyes were hurt Id give up

So would I said David and Joel to be in the fashion cried also I
know I would while little Phronsie squeezed up to Pollys side And
I too

Would what Puss asked Ben tossing her up high Have good things
cried the child in delight at understanding the others I would
really Ben she cried gravely when they all screamed

Well I hope so said Ben tossing her higher yet Dont laugh at
her boys put in Polly were all going to have good times now
Phronsie now weve got well

Yes laughed the child from her high perch we arent ever goin to
be sick again everany more she added impressively

The good times were coming for Pollycoming pretty near and she
didnt know it All the children were in the secret for as Mrs Pepper
declared Theyd have to know it and if they were let into the secret
theyd keep it better

So they had individually and collectively been intrusted with the
precious secret and charged with the extreme importance of never
letting any one know and they had been nearly bursting ever since with
the wild desire to impart their knowledge

Im afraid I shall tell said David running to his mother at last
oh mammy I dont dare stay near Polly I do want to tell so bad

Oh no you wont David said his mother encouragingly when you
know mother dont want you to and besides think how Pollyll look when
she sees it

I know cried David in the greatest rapture I wouldnt tell for all
the world I guess shell look nice dont you mother and he laughed
in glee at the thought

Poor child I guess she will and then Mrs Pepper laughed too till
the little old kitchen rang with delight at the accustomed sound

The children all had to play clap in and clap out in the bedroom while
it came and stage coach tooanything to make a noise Ben said
And then after they got nicely started in the game he would be missing
to help about the mysterious thing in the kitchen which was safe since
Polly couldnt see him go on account of her bandage So she didnt
suspect in the least And although the rest were almost dying to be
out in the kitchen they conscientiously stuck to their bargain to keep
Polly occupied Only Joel would open the door and peep once and then
Phronsie behind him began Oh I see the sto but David swooped
down on her in a twinkling and smothered the rest by tickling her

Once they came very near having the whole thing pop out Whatever is
that noise in the kitchen asked Polly as they all stopped to
take breath after the scuffle of stage coach It sounds just like
grating

Ill go and see cried Joel promptly and then he flew out where his
mother and Ben and two men were at work on a big black thing in the
corner The old stove strange to say was nowhere to be seen Something
else stood in its place a shiny black affair with a generous supply
of oven doors and altogether such a comfortable homelike look about
it as if it would sayIm going to make sunshine in this house

Oh Joel cried his mother turning around on him with very black
hands you havent told

No said Joel but shes hearin the noise Polly is

Hush said Ben to one of the men

We cant put it up without some noise the man replied but well be
as still as we can

Isnt it a big one ma asked Joel in the loudest of stage whispers
that Polly on the other side of the door couldnt have failed to hear if
Phronsie hadnt laughed just then

Go back Joe do said Ben play taganything he implored well
be through in a few minutes

It takes forever said Joel disappearing within the bedroom door
Luckily for the secret Phronsie just then ran a pin sticking up on the
arm of the old chair into her finger and Polly while comforting her
forgot to question Joel And then the mother came in and though she had
illconcealed hilarity in her voice she kept chattering and bustling
around with Pollys supper to such an extent that there was no chance
for a word to be got in

Next morning it seemed as if the little brown house would turn inside
out with joy

Oh mammy cried Polly jumping into her arms the first thing as Dr
Fisher untied the bandage my eyes are new just the same as if Id
just got em Dont they look different she asked earnestly running
to the cracked glass to see for herself

No said Ben I hope not the same brown ones Polly

Well said Polly hugging first one and then another everybody looks
different through them anyway

Oh cried Joel come out into the kitchen Polly its a great deal
better out there

May I asked Polly who was in such a twitter looking at everything
that she didnt know which way to turn

Yes said the doctor smiling at her

Well then sang Polly come mammy well go first isnt it just
lovelyoh MAMMY and Polly turned so very pale and looked as if she
were going to tumble right over that Mrs Pepper grasped her arm in
dismay

What is it she asked pointing to the corner while all the children
stood round in the greatest excitement

Why cried Phronsie its a stovedont you know Polly But Polly
gave one plunge across the room and before anybody could think she was
down on her knees with her arms flung right around the big black thing
and laughing and crying over it all in the same breath

And then they all took hold of hands and danced around it like wild
little things while Dr Fisher stole out silentlyand Mrs Pepper
laughed till she wiped her eyes to see them go

We arent ever goin to have any more burnt bread sang Polly all out
of breath

Nor your back isnt goin to break any more panted Ben with a very
red face

Hooray screamed Joel and David to fill any pause that might occur
while Phronsie gurgled and laughed at everything just as it came along
And then they all danced and capered again all but Polly who was
down before the precious stove examining and exploring into ovens and
everything that belonged to it

Oh ma she announced coming up to Mrs Pepper who had been obliged
to fly to her sewing again and exhibiting a very crocky face and a
pair of extremely smutty hands its most all ovens and its just
splendid

I know it answered her mother delighted in the joy of her child
My how black you are Polly

Oh I wish cried Polly as the thought struck her that Dr Fisher
could see it Where did he go to ma

I guess Dr Fisher has seen it before said Mrs Pepper and then
she began to laugh You havent ever asked where the stove came from
Polly

And to be sure Polly had been so overwhelmed that if the stove had
really dropped from the clouds it would have been small matter of
astonishment to her as long as it had come that was the main thing

Mammy said Polly turning around slowly with the stovelifter in her
hand did Dr Fisher bring that stove

He didnt exactly bring it answered her mother but I guess he knew
something about it

Oh hes the splendidest goodest man cried Polly that ever
breathed Did he really get us that stove

Yes said Mrs Pepper he would I couldnt stop him I dont know
how he found out you wanted one so bad but he said it must be kept as a
surprise when your eyes got well

And he saved my eyes cried Polly full of gratitude Ive got a
stove and two new eyes mammy just to think

We ought to be good after all our mercies said Mrs Pepper
thankfully looking around on her little group Joel was engaged in the
pleasing occupation of seeing how far he could run his head into the
biggest oven and then pulling it out to exhibit its blackness thus
engrossing the others in a perfect hubbub

Im going to bake my doctor some little cakes declared Polly when
there was comparative quiet

Do Polly cried Joel and then leave one or two over

No said Polly we cant have any because these must be very nice
Mammy cant I have some white on top just once she pleaded

I dont know dubiously replied Mrs Pepper eggs are dreadful dear
and

I dont care said Polly recklessly I must just once for Dr
Fisher

I tell you Polly said Mrs Pepper what you might do you might
make him some little apple tartsmost every one likes them you know

Well said Polly with a sigh I spose theyll have to do but some
time mammy Im going to bake him a big cake so there




A THREATENED BLOW


One day a few weeks after Mrs Pepper and Polly were busy in
the kitchen Phronsie was out in the orchard as the one scraggy
appletree was called by courtesy singing her rag doll to sleep under
its sheltering branches But Baby was cross and wouldnt go to sleep
and Phronsie was on the point of giving up and returning to the house
when a strain of music made her pause with dolly in her apron There
she stood with her finger in her mouth in utter astonishment wondering
where the sweet sounds came from

Oh Phronsie screamed Polly from the back door where areoh
here come quick its the beautifullest

What is it eagerly asked the little one hopping over the stubby
grass leaving poor discarded Baby on its snubby nose where it
dropped in her hurry

Oh a monkey cried Polly do hurry the sweetest little monkey you
ever saw

What is a monkey asked Phronsie skurrying after Polly to the gate
where her mother was waiting for them

Why a monkeysamonkey explained Polly I dont know any
bettern that Here he is Isnt he splendid and she lifted Phronsie
up to the big post where she could see finely

Ooh ow screamed little Phronsie see him Polly just see him

A man with an organ was standing in the middle of the road playing away
with all his might and at the end of a long rope was a lively little
monkey in a bright red coat and a smart cocked hat The little creature
pulled off his hat and with one long jump coming on the fence he made
Phronsie a most magnificent bow Strange to say the child wasnt in the
least frightened but put out her little fat hand speaking in gentle
tones Poor little monkey come here poor little monkey

Turning up his little wrinkled face and glancing fearfully at his
master Jocko began to grimace and beg for something to eat The man
pulled the string and struck up a merry tune and in a minute the monkey
spun around and around at such a lively pace and put in so many queer
antics that the little audience were fairly convulsed with laughter

I cant pay you said Mrs Pepper wiping her eyes when at last the
man pulled up the strap whistling to Jocko to jump up but Ill give
you something to eat and the monkey too he shall have something for
his pains in amusing my children

The man looked very cross when she brought him out only brown bread and
two cold potatoes

Havent you got nothin bettern that

Its as good as we have answered Mrs Pepper

The man threw down the bread in the road But Jocko thankfully ate his
share Polly and Phronsie busily feeding him and then he turned and
snapped up the portion his master had left in the dusty road

Then they moved on Mrs Pepper and Polly going back to their work in
the kitchen A little down the road the man struck up another tune
Phronsie who had started merrily to tell Baby all about it stopped a
minute to hear andshe didnt go back to the orchard

About two hours after Polly said merrily

Im going to call Phronsie in mammy she must be awfully tired and
hungry by this time

She sang gayly on the way Im coming Phronsie comingwhy where
peeping under the tree

Baby lay on its face disconsolately on the groundand the orchard was
empty Phronsie was gone

Its no use said Ben to the distracted household and such of the
neighbors as the news had brought hurriedly to the scene to look any
more around herebut somebody must go toward Hingham hed be likely to
go that way

No one could tell where he would go cried Polly wringing her hands

But hed change Ben if he thought folks would think hed gone there
said Mrs Pepper

We must go all roads said Ben firmly one must take the stage to
Boxville and Ill take Deacon Browns wagon on the Hingham road and
somebody else must go to Toad Hollow

Ill go in the stage screamed Joel who could scarcely see out of his
eyes he had cried so Ill findfind herI know

Be spry then Joe and catch it at the corner

Everybody soon knew that little Phronsie Pepper had gone off with a
cross organ man and an awful monkey and in the course of an hour
dozens of people were out on the hot dusty roads in search

Whats the matter asked a testy old gentleman in the stage of Joel
who in his anxiety to see both sides of the road at once bobbed the
old gentleman in the face so often as the stage lurched that at last he
knocked his hat over his eyes

My sisters gone off with a monkey explained Joel bobbing over to
the other side as he thought he caught sight of something pink that
he felt sure must be Phronsies apron Stop stop there she is
he roared and the driver who had his instructions and was fully in
sympathy pulled up so suddenly that the old gentleman flew over into
the opposite seat

Where

But when they got up to it Joel saw that it was only a bit of pink
calico flapping on a clothesline so he climbed back and away they
rumbled again

The others were having the same luck No trace could be found of the
child To Ben who took the Hingham road the minutes seemed like hours

I wont go back he muttered until I take her I cant see mothers
face

But the ten miles were nearly traversed almost the last hope was gone
Into every thicket and lurking place by the roadside had he peeredbut
no Phronsie Deacon Browns horse began to lag

Go on said Ben hoarsely oh dear Lord make me find her

The hot sun poured down on the boys face and he had no cap What cared
he for that On and on he went Suddenly the horse stopped Ben doubled
up the reins to give him a cut when WHOA he roared so loud that the
horse in very astonishment gave a lurch that nearly flung him headlong
But he was over the wheel in a twinkling and up with a bound to a small
thicket of scrubby bushes on a high hill by the roadside Here lay a
little bundle on the ground and close by it a big black dog and over
the whole standing guard was a boy a little bigger than Ben with
honest gray eyes And the bundle was Phronsie

Dont wake her up said the boy warningly as Ben with a hungry look
in his eyes leaped up the hill shes tired to death

Shes my sister cried Ben our Phronsie

I know it said the boy kindly but I wouldnt wake her up yet if I
were you Ill tell you all about it and he took Bens hand which was
as cold as ice




SAFE


Its all right Prince the boy added encouragingly to the big dog
who lifting his noble head had turned two big eyes steadily on Ben
Hes all right lie down again

Then flinging himself down on the grass he told Ben how he came to
rescue Phronsie

Prince and I were out for a stroll said he I live over in Hingham
pointing to the pretty little town just a short distance before them in
the hollow that is laughing I do this summer Well we were out
strolling along about a mile below here on the crossroad and all of a
sudden just as if they sprung right up out of the ground I saw a man
with an organ and a monkey and a little girl coming along the road
She was crying and as soon as Prince saw that he gave a growl and
then the man saw us and he looked so mean and cringing I knew there
must be something wrong and I inquired of him what he was doing with
that little girl and then she looked up and begged so with her eyes
and all of a sudden broke away from him and ran towards me screamingI
want Polly Well the man sprang after her then I tell you here the
boy forgot his caution about waking Phronsiewe went for him Prince
and I Prince is a noble fellow here the dogs ears twitched very
perceptibly and he kept at that man oh how he bit him till he had
to run for fear the monkey would get killed

Was Phronsie frightened asked Ben shes never seen strangers

Not a bit said the boy cheerily she just clung to me like
everythingI only wish she was my sister he added impulsively

What were you going to do with her if I hadnt come along asked Ben

Well I got out on the main road said the boy because I thought
anybody who had lost her would probably come through this way but if
somebody hadnt come I was going to carry her in to Hingham and the
father and Id had to contrive some way to do

Well said Ben as the boy finished and fastened his bright eyes on
him somebody did come along and now I must get her home about as fast
as I can for poor mammyand Polly

Yes said the boy Ill help you lift her perhaps she wont wake
up

The big dog moved away a step or two but still kept his eye on
Phronsie

There said the boy brightly as they laid the child on the wagon
seat now when you get in you can hold her head thats it he added
seeing them both fixed to his satisfaction But still Ben lingered

Thank you he tried to say

I know laughed the boy only its Prince instead of me and he
pulled forward the big black creature who had followed faithfully down
the hill to see the last of it To the front sir there Were coming
to see you he continued if you will let uswhere do you live

Do come said Ben lighting up for he was just feeling he couldnt
bear to look his last on the merry honest face anybodyll tell you
where Mrs Pepper lives

Is she a Pepper asked the boy laughing and pointing to the
unconscious little heap in the wagon and are you a Pepper

Yes said Ben laughing too There are five of us besides mother

Jolly thats something like Goodbye Come on Prince Then away
home to mother Phronsie never woke up or turned over once till she was
put a little pink sleepy heap into her mothers arms Joel was there
crying bitterly at his forlorn search The testy old gentleman in the
seat opposite had relented and ordered the coach about and brought
him home in an outburst of grief when all hope was gone And one after
another they all had come back disheartened to the distracted mother
Polly alone clung to hope

Ben will bring her mammy I know God will let him she whispered

But when Ben did bring her Polly for the second time in her life
tumbled over with a gasp into old Mrs Bascoms lap

Home and mother Little Phronsie slept all that night straight through
The neighbors came in softly and with awestruck visages stole into the
bedroom to look at the child and as they crept out again thoughts
of their own little ones tugging at their hearts the tears would drop
unheeded




NEW FRIENDS


Up the stairs of the hotel two steps at a time ran a boy with a big
black dog at his heels Come on Prince soft now as they neared a
door at the end of the corridors

It opened into a corner room overlooking the Park as the small
open space in front of the hotel was called Within the room there was
sunshine and comfort it being the most luxurious one in the house
which the proprietor had placed at the disposal of this most exacting
guest He didnt look very happy howeverthe gentleman who sat in an
easy chair by the window a large handsome old gentleman whose whole
bearing showed plainly that personal comfort had always been his and
was therefore neither a matter of surprise nor thankfulness

Where have you been he asked turning around to greet the boy who
came in followed by Prince

Oh such a long story father he cried flushed his eyes sparkling
as he flung back the dark hair from his forehead You cant even
guess

Never mind now said the old gentleman testily your stories are
always long the paper hasnt comestrange indeed that one must needs
be so annoyed do ring that bell again

So the bell was pulled and a porter popped in his head

What is it sir

The paper said the old gentleman irritably hasnt it come yet

No sir said the man and then he repeated taint in yet please
sir

Very wellyou said so once thats all waving his hand then as the
door closed he said to his son That pays one for coming to such an
outoftheway country place as this away from papersI never will do
it again

As the old gentleman against the advice of many friends who knew his
dependence on externals had determined to come to this very place the
boy was not much startled at the decisive words He stood very quietly
however until his father finished Then he said

Its too bad father supposing I tell you my story Perhaps youll
enjoy hearing it while you waitits really quite newspaperish

Well you might as well tell it now I suppose said the old
gentleman but it is a great shame about that paper to advertise that
morning papers are to be obtainedits a swindle Jasper a complete
swindle and the old gentleman looked so very irate that the boy
exerted himself to soothe him

I know he said but they cant help the trains being late

They shouldnt have the trains late said his father unreasonably
Theres no necessity for all this prating about trains late Im
convinced its because they forgot to send down for the papers till they
were all sold

I dont believe thats it father said the boy trying to change the
subject but you dont know how splendid Prince has been nor And
then such a breakfast continued the old gentleman

My liver certainly will be in a dreadful state if these things
continue And he got up and going to the corner of the room opened
his medicine chest and taking a box of pills therefrom he swallowed
two which done he came back with a somewhat easier expression to his
favorite chair

He was just splendid father began the boy he went for him I tell
you

I hope Jasper your dog has not been doing anything violent said the
old gentleman I must caution you hell get you into trouble some day
and then therell be a heavy bill to pay he grows more irritable every
day

Irritable cried the boy flinging his arms around the dogs neck who
was looking up at the old gentleman in high disdain Hes done the most
splendid thing you ever saw Why he saved a little girl father from
a cross old organman and he drove that manoh you ought to have seen
him run

And now that it was over Jasper put back his head and laughed long and
loud as he remembered the rapid transit of the musical pair

Well how do you know she wasnt the mans daughter asked his father
determined to find fault someway You havent any business to go around
the country setting your dog on people I shall have an awful bill
to pay some day Jasperan awful bill he continued getting up and
commencing to pace up and down the floor in extreme irritation

Father cried the boy half laughing half vexed springing to his
side and keeping step with him we found her brother he came along
when we were by the side of the road We couldnt go any further for
the poor little thing was all tired out And dont you think they live
over in Badgertown and

Well said the old gentleman pausing in his walk and taking out
his watch to wonder if that paper would ever come she had probably
followed the organman so it served her right after all

Well but father and the boys dark eyes glowed she was such a
cunning little thing she wasnt more than four years old and she had
such a pretty little yellow head and she said so funnyI want Polly

Did she said the old gentleman getting interested in spite of
himself what then

Why then sir said Jasper delighted at his success in diverting
his thoughts Prince and I waitedand waited and I was just going to
bring her here to ask you what we should do when Dear me said
the old gentleman instinctively starting back as if he actually saw the
forlorn little damsel you neednt ever bring such people here Jasper
I dont know what to do with them Im sure

Well said the boy laughing we didnt have to did we Prince
stroking the big head of the dog who was slowly following the two as
they paced up and down but keeping carefully on the side of his master
for just as we really didnt know what to do dont you think there was
a big wagon came along drawn by the ricketiest old horse and a boy in
the wagon looking both sides of the road and into every bush just as
wild as he could be and before I could think hardly he spied us and
if he didnt jump I thought hed broken his leg

And I suppose he just abused you for what you had done observed the
old gentleman petulantly thats about all the gratitude there is in
this world

He didnt seem to see me at all said the boy I thought hed eat the
little girl up

Ought to have looked out for her better then grumbled the old
gentleman determined to find fault with somebody

And hes a splendid fellow I just know cried Jasper waxing
enthusiastic and his name is Pepper

Pepper repeated his father no nice family ever had the name of
Pepper

Well I dont care and Jaspers laugh was loud and merry hes
nice anywayI know and the little things nice and Im going to see
themcant I father

Dear me said his father how can you Jasper You do have the
strangest tastes I ever saw

Its dreadful dull here pleaded the boy touching the right string
you know that yourself father and I dont know any boys around here
and Prince and I are so lonely on our walksdo permit me father

The old gentleman who really cared very little about it turned away
muttering Well Im sure I dont care go where you like when a
knock was heard at the door and the paper was handed in which broke up
the conversation and restored good humor

The next day but one Ben was out by the woodpile trying to break up
some kindlings for Polly who was washing up the dishes and otherwise
preparing for the delights of baking day

Hulloa said a voice bethought he knew

He turned around to see the merryfaced boy and the big black dog who
immediately began to wag his tail as if willing to recognize him

You see I thought youd never look round said the boy with a laugh
Hows the little girl

Oh you have come really cried Ben springing over the woodpile
with a beaming face Polly

But Polly was already by the door with dishcloth in hand This is my
sister Polly began Benand then stopped not knowing the boys name

Im Jasper King said the boy stepping upon the flat stone by Pollys
side and taking off his cap he put out his hand And this is Prince
he added

Polly put her hand in his and received a hearty shake and then she
sprang over the big stove dishcloth and all and just flung her arms
around the dogs neck

Oh you splendid fellow you said she Dont you know we all think
youre as good as gold

The dog submitted to the astonishing proceeding as if he liked it while
Jasper delighted with Pollys appreciation beamed down on them and
struck up friendship with her on the instant

Now I must call Phronsie said Polly getting up her face as red as
a rose

Is her name Phronsie asked the boy with interest

No its Sophronia said Polly but we call her Phronsie

What a very funny name said Jasper Sophronia is for such a little
thingand yours is Polly is it not he asked turning around suddenly
on her

Yes said Polly no not truly Polly its Mary my real name isbut
Ive always been Polly

I like Polly best too declared Jasper it sounds so nice

And his name is Ben said Polly

Ebenezer you mean said Ben correcting her

Well we call him Ben said Polly it dont ever seem as if there was
any Ebenezer about it

I should think not laughed Jasper

Well I must get Phronsie again said Polly running back into the
bedroom where that small damsel was busily engaged in washing Baby
in the basin of water that she had with extreme difficulty succeeded in
getting down on the floor She had then by means of a handful of soft
soap taken from Pollys soapbowl during the dishwashing and a bit of
old cotton plastered both herself and Baby to a comfortable degree of
stickiness

Phronsie said Pollydear me what you doing the big dogs out
there you know that scared the naughty organman and the boy but
before the words were half out Phronsie had slipped from under her
hands and to Pollys extreme dismay clattered out into the kitchen

Here she is cried Jasper meeting her at the door The little soapy
hands were grasped and kissing herUgh he said as the soft soap
plentifully spread on her face met his mouth

Oh Phronsie you shouldnt cried Polly and then they all burst out
into a peal of laughter at Jaspers funny grimaces

Shes been washing Baby explained Polly wiping her eyes and
looking at Phronsie who was hanging over Prince in extreme affection
Evidently Prince still regarded her as his especial property

Have you got a baby asked Jasper I thought she was the baby
pointing to Phronsie

Oh I mean her littlest dolly she always calls her Baby said Polly
Come Phronsie and have your face washed and a clean apron on

When Phronsie could be fairly persuaded that Prince would not run
away during her absence she allowed herself to be taken off and soon
reappeared her own dainty little self Ben in the meantime had
been initiating Jasper into the mysteries of cutting the wood the
toolhouse and all the surroundings of the little brown house They
had received a reinforcement in the advent of Joel and David who
stared delightedly at Phronsies protector made friends with the dog
and altogether had had such a thoroughly good time that Phronsie
coming back clapped her hands in glee to hear them

I wish mammy was home said Polly polishing up the last cup
carefully

Let me put it up said Jasper taking it from her it goes up here
dont it with the rest reaching up to the uppershelf of the old
cupboard

Yes said Polly

Oh I should think youd have real good times said the boy
enviously I havent a single sister or brother

Havent you said Polly looking at him in extreme pity Yes we do
have real fun she added answering his questioning look the house is
just brimful sometimes even if we are poor

We arent poor said Joel who never could bear to be pitied Then
with a very proud air he said in a grand way At any rate we arent
going to be long for somethings coming

What do you mean Joey asked Ben while the rest looked equally
amazed

Our ships said Joel confidently as if they were right before their
eyes at which they all screamed

See Pollys stove cried Phronsie wishing to entertain in her turn
Here tis running up to it and pointing with her fat little finger

Yes I see cried Jasper pretending to be greatly surprised its
new isnt it

Yes said the child its very all new four yesterdays ago

And then Polly stopped in sweeping up and related with many additions
and explanations from the others the history of the stove and good Dr
Fisher upon whom they all dilated at great length and the dreadful
measles and everything And Jasper sympathized and rejoiced with them
to their hearts content and altogether got so very homelike that they
all felt as if they had known him for a year Ben neglected his work a
little but then visitors didnt come every day to the Peppers so
while Polly worked away at her bread which she was going to make like
biscuits she said the audience gathered in the little old kitchen was
in the merriest mood and enjoyed everything to the fullest extent

Do put in another stick Bensie dear said Polly this bread wont be
fit for anything

Isnt this fun though cried Jasper running up to try the oven I
wish I could ever bake and he looked longingly at the little brown
biscuits waiting their turn out on the table

You come out some day said Polly sociably and well all try
bakingmammyd like to have you I know feeling sure that nothing
would be too much for Mrs Pepper to do for the protector of little
Phronsie

I will cried Jasper perfectly delighted You cant think how
awfully dull it is out in Hingham

Dont you live there asked Polly with a gasp almost dropping a tin
full of little brown lumps of dough she was carrying to the oven

Live there cried Jasper and then he burst out into a merry laugh
No indeed I hope not Why were only spending the summer there
father and I in the hotel

Wheres your mother asked Joel squeezing in between Jasper and
his audience And then they all felt instinctively that a very wrong
question had been asked

I havent any mother said the boy in a low voice

They all stood quite still for a moment then Polly said I wish youd
come out sometime and you may bakeor anything else she added and
there was a kinder ring to her voice than ever

No mother Polly for her life couldnt imagine how anybody could feel
without a mother but the very words alone smote her heart and there
was nothing she wouldnt have done to give pleasure to one who had done
so much for them

I wish you could see our mother she said gently Why here she
comes now oh mamsie dear she cried Do Joe run and take her
bundle

Mrs Pepper stopped a minute to kiss Phronsieher baby was dearer than
ever to her now Then her eye fell on Jasper who stood respectfully
waiting and watching her with great interest

Is this she asked taking it all in at the first glancethe boy with
the honest eyes as Ben had described himand the big black dogis
this the boy who saved my little girl

Oh maam cried Jasper I didnt do much twas Prince

I guess you neverll know how much you did do said Mrs Pepper Then
looking with a long keen gaze into the boys eyes that met her own so
frankly and kindly Ill trust him she said to herself a boy with
those eyes cant help but be good

Her eyes are just the same as Pollys thought Jasper just such
laughing ones only Pollys are brown and he liked her on the spot

And then somehow the hubbub ceased Polly went on with her work and
the others separated and Mrs Pepper and Jasper had a long talk When
the mothers eyes fell on Phronsie playing around on the floor she gave
the boy a grateful smile that he thought was beautiful

Well I declare said Jasper at last looking up at the old clock in
the corner by the side of the cupboard Im afraid Ill miss the stage
and then father neverll let me come again Come Prince

Oh dont go cried Phronsie wailing Let doggie stay Oh make him
stay mammy

I cant Phronsie said Mrs Pepper smiling if he thinks he ought
to go

Ill come again said Jasper eagerly if I may maam

He looked up at Mrs Pepper as he stood cap in hand waiting for the
answer

Im sure we should be glad if your fatherll be willing she added
thinking proudly My children are an honor to anybody Im sure as
she glanced around on the bright little group she could call her own
But be sure Jasper and she laid her hand on his arm as she looked
down into his eyes that you father is willing thats all

Oh yes maam said the boy but he will be I guess if he feels
well

Then come on Thursday said Polly and cant we bake something then
mammy

Im sure I dont care laughed Mrs Pepper but you wont find much
but brown flour and meal to bake with

Well we can pretend said Polly and we can cut the cakes with the
heartshape and theyll do for anything

Oh Ill come laughed Jasper ready for such lovely fun in the old
kitchen look out for me on Thursday Ben

So Jasper and Prince took their leave all the children accompanying
them to the gate and then after seeing him fairly started on a smart
run to catch the stage Prince scampering at his heels they all began
to sing his praises and to wish for Thursday to come

But Jasper didnt come Thursday came and went a beautiful bright
sunny day but with no signs of the merry boy whom all had begun to
love nor of the big black dog The children had made all the needful
preparations with much ostentation and bustle and were in a state of
excited happiness ready for any gale But the last hope had to be given
up as the old clock ticked away hour after hour And at last Polly
had to put Phronsie to bed who wouldnt stop crying enough to eat her
supper at the dreadful disappointment

He couldnt come I know said both Ben and Polly standing staunchly
up for their new friend but Joel and David felt that he had broken his
word

He promised said Joel vindictively

I dont believe his fatherd let him said Polly wiping away a sly
tear I know Jasperd come if he could

Mrs Pepper wisely kept her own counsel simply giving them a kindly
caution

Dont you go to judging him children till you know

Well he promised said Joel as a settler

Arent you ashamed Joel said his mother to talk about any one
whose back is turned Wait till he tells you the reason himself

Joel hung his head and then began to tease David in the corner to make
up for his disappointment

The next morning Ben had to go to the store after some more meal As he
was going out rather dismally the storekeeper who was also postmaster
called out Oh halloa there

What is it asked Ben turning back thinking perhaps Mr Atkins
hadnt given him the right change

Here said Mr Atkins stepping up to the Postoffice department
quite smart with its array of boxes and official notices where Ben had
always lingered wishing there might be sometime a letter for himor
some of them Youve got a sister Polly havent you

Yes said Ben wondering what was coming next

Well shes got a letter said the postmaster holding up a nice big
envelope looking just like those that Ben had so many times wished
for That magic piece of white paper danced before the boys eyes for a
minute then he said It cant be for her Mr Atkins why shes never
had one

Well shes got one now sure enough said Mr Atkins here tis
plain enough and he read what he had no need to study much as it had
already passed examination by his own and his wifes faithful eyes
Miss Polly Pepper near the Turnpike Badgertownthats her isnt
it he added laying it down before Bens eyes Must be a first time
for everything you know my boy and he laughed long over his own
joke so take it and run along home For Ben still stood looking at
it and not offering to stir

If you say so said the boy as if Mr Atkins had given him something
out of his own pocket but Im afraid tisnt for Polly Then
buttoning up the precious letter in his jacket he spun along home as
never before

Polly Polly he screamed Where is she mother

I dont know said Mrs Pepper coming out of the bedroom Dear me
is anybody hurt Ben

I dont know said Ben in a state to believe anything but Pollys
got a letter

Polly got a letter cried Mrs Pepper what do you mean Ben

I dont know repeated the boy still holding out the precious letter
but Mr Atkins gave it to me where is Polly

I know where she is said Joel shes upstairs And he flew out in
a twinkling and just as soon reappeared with Polly scampering after him
in the wildest excitement

And then the kitchen was in an uproar as the precious missive was put
into Pollys hand and they all gathered around her wondering and
examining till Ben thought he would go wild with the delay

I wonder where it did come from said Polly in the greatest anxiety
examining again the address

Where does the postmark say asked Mrs Pepper looking over her
shoulder

Its all rubbed out said Polly peering at it you cant see
anything

Do open it said Ben and then youll find out

But praps tisnt for me said Polly timidly

Well Mr Atkins says tis said Ben impatiently here Ill open it
for you Polly

No let her open it for herself Ben protested his mother

But she wont said Ben do tear it open Polly

No Im goin to get a knife she said

Ill get one cried Joel running up to the table drawer heres one
Polly

Oh dear groaned Ben you neverll get it open at this rate

But at last it was cut and they all holding their breath gazed
awestruck while Polly drew out the mysterious missive

What does it say gasped Mrs Pepper

Dear Miss Polly began both Ben and Polly in a breath Let Polly
read said Joel who couldnt hear in the confusion

Well go on Polly said Ben hurry

Dear Miss Polly I was so sorry I couldnt come on Thursday

Oh its Jasper its Jasper cried all the children in a breath

I told you so cried Ben and Polly perfectly delighted to find their
friend vindicated fullythere Joey Pepper

Well I dont care cried Joe nothing daunted he didnt come
anywaydo go on Polly

I was so sorry I couldnt come began Polly

You read that said Joel

I know it said Polly but its just lovely on Thursday but my
father was sick and I couldnt leave him If you dont mind Ill come
againI mean Ill come some other day if its just as convenient for
you for I do so want the baking and the nice time I forgot to say
that I had a cold to here Jasper had evidently had a struggle in his
mind whether there should be two os or one and he had at last decided
it by crossing out one but my father is willing I should come when I
get well Give my love to all and especially remember me respectfully
to your mother Your friend

JASPER ELYOT KING

Oh lovely lovely cried Polly flying around with the letter in her
hand so he is coming

Ben was just as wild as she was for no one knew but Polly just how the
new friend had stepped into his heart Phronsie went to sleep happy
hugging Baby

And dont you think Baby dear she whispered sleepily and Polly
heard her say as she was tucking her in that Jasper is really comin
reallyand the big beyoutiful doggie too




PHRONSIE PAYS A DEBT OF GRATITUDE


And now I tell you said Polly the next day lets make Jasper
something cant we ma

Oh do do cried all the other children lets but whatll it be
Polly

I dont know about this interrupted Mrs Pepper I dont see how you
could get anything to him if you could make it

Oh we could mamsie said Polly eagerly running up to her for Ben
knows and he says we can do it

Oh well if Ben and you have had your heads together I suppose its
all right laughed Mrs Pepper but I dont see how you can do it

Well we can mother truly put in Ben Ill tell you how and
youll say itll be splendid You see Deacon Blodgetts goin over to
Hingham tomorrow I heard him tell Miss Blodgett so and he goes right
past the hotel and we can do it up real niceand itll please Jasper
sodo mammy

And its real dull there Jasper says put in Polly persuasively
and just think mammy no brothers and sisters And Polly looked
around on the others

After that there was no need to say anything more her mother would have
consented to almost any plan then

Well go on children she said you may do it I dont see but what
you can get em there well enough but Im sure I dont know what you
can make

Cant we said Pollyand she knelt down by her mothers side and put
her face in between the sewing in Mrs Peppers lap and the eyes bent
kindly down on hermake some little cakes real cakes I mean now
dont say no mammy she said alarmed for she saw a no slowly
coming in the eyes above her as Mrs Pepper began to shake her head

But we havent any white flour Polly began her mother I know
said Polly but well make em of brown itll do if youll give us
some raisinsyou know theres some in the bowl mammy

I was saving them for a nest egg said Mrs Pepper meaning at some
future time to indulge in another plumpudding that the children so
loved

Well do give em to us cried Polly do ma

I want em for a plumpudding sometime said Mrs Pepper

Ow and Joel with a howl sprung up from the floor where he had been
trying to make a cart for Baby out of an old box and joined Mrs
Pepper and Polly No dont give em away ma he screamed lets
have our plumpuddingnow Polly Pepper youre agoin to bake up all
our raisins in nasty little cakesand

Joey commanded Mrs Pepper hush what word did you say

Well blubbered Joel wiping his tears away with his grimy little
hand Pollysagointo give

I should rather youd never have a plumpudding than to say such
words said Mrs Pepper sternly taking up her work again And
besides do you think what Jasper has done for you and her face grew
very white around the lips

Well he can have plumpuddings said Joel whimpering forever an
ever if he wants themandand

Well Joey said Polly there dont feel bad and she put her arms
around him and tried to wipe away the tears that still rolled down his
cheeks We wont give em if you dont want us to but Jaspers sick
and there isnt anything for him to do and here she whispered slyly
up into his ear dont you remember how you liked folks to send you
things when you had the measles

Yes I know said Joel beginning to smile through his tears wasnt
it fun Polly

I guess twas laughed Polly back again pleased at the return of
sunshine Well Jasperll be just as pleased as you were cause we
love him and want to do somethin for him he was so good to Phronsie

I will Polly I will cried Joel completely won over do lets make
em for him and put em in thick oh thick as you can and determined
to do nothing by halves Joel ran generously for the precious howl of
raisins and after setting it on the table began to help Polly in all
needful preparations

Mrs Pepper smiled away to herself to see happiness restored to the
little group And soon a pleasant hum and bustle went on around the
baking table the centre of attraction

Now said Phronsie coming up to the table and standing on tiptoe to
see Polly measure out the flour Im agoin to bake something for my
sick man I am

Oh no Phronsie you cant began Polly

Hey asked Joel with a daub of flour on the tip of his chubby nose
gained by too much peering into Pollys flourbag What did she say
Polly watching her shake the clouds of flour in the sieve

She said she was goin to bake something for Jasper said Polly
There as she whisked in the flour now thats done

No I didnt say Jasper said Phronsie I didnt say Jasper she
repeated emphatically

Why what did you say Pet asked Polly astonished while little
Davie repeated What did you say Phronsie

I said my sick man said Phronsie shaking her yellow head poor sick
man

Who does she mean said Polly in despair stopping a moment her
violent stirring that threatened to overturn the whole cakebowl

I guess she means Prince said Joel Cant I stir Polly

Oh no said Polly only one person must stir cake

Why asked Joel why Polly

Oh I dont know said Polly cause tis so never mind now Joel Do
you mean Prince Phronsie

No I dont mean Princey said the child decisively I mean my sick
man

Its Jaspers father I guess she means said Mrs Pepper over in the
corner but what in the world

Yes yes cried Phronsie perfectly delighted at being at last
understood and hopping on one toe my sick man

I shall give up said Polly tumbling over in a chair with the cake
spoon in her hand from which a small sticky lump fell on her apron
which Joel immediately pounced upon and devoured What do you want to
bake Phronsie she gasped holding the spoon sticking up straight and
staring at the child

A gingerbread boy said the child promptly hed like that best
poor sick man and she commenced to climb up to active preparations




A LETTER TO JASPER


Mamsie what shall we do implored Polly of her mother

I dont know said her mother however did that get into her head do
you suppose

I am sure I cant tell said Polly jumping up and beginning to stir
briskly to make up for lost time Praps she heard us talking about
Jaspers having to take care of his sick father and how hard it must be
to be sick away from home

Yes said Phronsie but hell be glad to see my gingerbread boy I
guess poor sick man

Oh Phronsie cried Polly in great distress you arent ever going
to make a gingerbread boy today see well put in a cunning little
cake for Mr Kingfull of raisins Phronsie wont that be lovely
and Polly began to fill a little scalloped tin with some of the cake
mixture

Nno said the child eying it suspiciously that isnt like a
gingerbread boy Polly hell like that best

Mamsie said Polly we cant let her make a dreadful horrid
gingerbread boy to send Mr King he neverll let Jasper come here
again

Oh let her cried Joel she can bake it and Dave an Ill eat it
and he picked up a raisin that had fallen under the table and began
crunching it with great gusto

That wouldnt be fair said Polly gloomily Do get her off from it
mammy

Phronsie said Mrs Pepper going up back of the child who sat
patiently in her high chair waiting for Polly to let her begin hadnt
you rather wait and give your gingerbread boy to Jasper for his
father when he comes

Oh no no cried Phronsie twisting in her chair in great
apprehension I want to send it now I do

Well Polly said her mother laughing after all its best I think
to let her it cant do any harm anywayand instead of Mr Kings
not letting Jasper come if hes a sensible man that wont make any
difference and if he isnt why then thered be sure to something come
up sometime to make trouble

Well said Polly I suppose shes got to and perhaps as a
consoling idea struck her perhaps shell want to eat it up herself
when its done Here Phronsie giving her a handful of the cake
mixture which she stiffened with flour to the right thickness there
you can call that a gingerbread boy see wont it make a beautiful
one

You neednt think said Mrs Pepper seeing Phronsies delighted face
and laughing as she went back to her work but what that gingerbread
boyll go

When the little cakes were done eight of them and set upon the table
for exhibition they one and all protested that they never saw so fine a
lot Polly was delighted with the praise they received and her mothers
commendation that she was growing a better cook every day How glad
Jasperll be wont he mamsie said she

The children walked around and around the table admiring and pointing
out the chief points of attraction as they appeared before their
discriminating eyes

I should choose that one said Joel pointing at one which was
particularly plummy with a raisin standing up on one end with a festive
air as if to say theres lots of us inside you better believe

I wouldnt said Davie Id have thatthats cracked so pretty

So tis said Mrs Pepper theyre all as light as a feather Polly

But my gingerbread boy cried Phronsie running eagerly along with a
particularly ugly looking specimen of a cake figure in her hand is the
beyewtifullest isnt it Polly

Oh dear groaned Polly it looks just awfully dont it Ben

Hoh hoh laughed Joel in derision his leg is crooked see
Phronsieyou better let Davie an me have it

No no screamed the child in terror thats my sick mans
gingerbread boy it is

Joe put it down said Ben Yes Phronsie you shall have it there
its all safe and he put it carefully into Phronsies apron when she
breathed easier

And he hasnt but one eye still laughed Joel while little Davie
giggled too

He did have two said Polly but she punched the other in with her
thumb dont boys she said aside youll make her feel bad do stop
laughing Now howll we send the things

Put em in a basket said Ben thats nicest

But we havent got any basket said Polly except the potato basket
and theyd be lost in that

Cant we take your workbasket mamsie asked Ben theyd look so
nice in that

Oh said Mrs Pepper that wouldnt do I couldnt spare it and
besides its all broken at the side Ben that dont look nice

Oh dear said Polly sitting down on one of the hard wooden chairs
to think I do wish we had things nice to send to sick people And her
forehead puckered up in a little hard knot

Well have to do em up in a paper Polly said Ben there isnt
any other way theyll look nice in anything cause they are nice he
added comfortingly

If we only had some flowers said Polly that would set em off

Youre always athinkin of flowers Polly said Ben I guess the
cakesll have to go without em

I suppose they will said Polly stifling a little sigh Wheres the
paper

Ive got a nice piece upstairs said Ben just right Ill get it

Put my gingerbread boy on top cried Phronsie handing him up

So Polly packed the little cakes neatly in two rows and laid the
gingerbread boy in a fascinating attitude across the top

He looks as if hed been struck by lightning said Ben viewing him
critically as he came in the door with the paper

Be still said Polly trying not to laugh thats because he baked so
funny it made his feet stick out

Children said Mrs Pepper howll Jasper know where the cakes come
from

Why hell know its us said Polly of course cause itll make him
think of the baking were going to have when he gets well

Well but you dont say so said Mrs Pepper smiling tisnt polite
to send it this way

Whateverll we do mammy said all four children in dismay while
Phronsie simply stared Cant we send em at all

Why yes said their mother I hope so Im sure after youve got em
baked but you might answer Jaspers letter I should think and tell him
about em and the gingerbread boy

Oh dear said Polly ready to fly I couldnt mamsie I never wrote a
letter

Well you never had one before did you said her mother composedly
biting her thread Never say you cant Polly cause you dont know
what you can do till youve tried

You write Ben said Polly imploringly

No said Ben I think the nicest way is for all to say somethin
then twont be hard for any of us

Wheres the paper queried Polly coming from I wonder

Joel said Mrs Pepper run to the bureau in the bedroom and open
the top drawer and get a green box there

So Joel quite important at the errand departed and presently put the
designated box into his mothers hand

There now Im going to give you this and she took out a small sheet
of paper slightly yellowed by age but being giltedged it looked very
magnificent to the five pairs of eyes directed to it

Now Ben you get the ink bottle and the pen and then go to work

So Ben reached down from the upper shelf in the cupboard the ink bottle
and a pen in a black wooden penholder

Oh mamsie cried Polly thats where Phronsie bit it off when she
was a baby isnt it holding up the stubby end where the little ball
had disappeared

Yes said Mrs Pepper and now youre going to write about her
gingerbread boy with itwell time goes to be sure And she bent
over her work again harder than ever Poor woman if she could only
scrape together enough money to get her children into schoolthat was
the earnest wish of her heart She must do it soon for Ben was twelve
years old but with all her strivings and scrimpings she could only
manage to put bread into their mouths and live from day to day I know
I ought to be thankful for that she said to herself not taking time
even to cry over her troubles But oh the learning they must have
that

Now said Polly howll we do it Ben as they ranged themselves
around the table on which reposed the cakes you begin

How do folks begin a letter asked Ben in despair of his mother

How did Jasper begin his asked Mrs Pepper back again Oh cried
Polly running into the bedroom to get the precious missive Dear Miss
Pollythats what it says

Well said Mrs Pepper then youd better say Dear Mister
Jasperor you might say Dear Mr King

Oh dear cried Polly that would be the father thenspose he
should think we wrote to him and Polly looked horrorstricken to the
last degree

There there tis said Ben Dear Mister Jaspernow whatll we
say

Why say about the cakes replied Polly

And the gingerbread boy cried Phronsie Oh tell about him Polly
do

Yes yes Phronsie said Polly we willwhy tell him how we wish
he could have come and that we baked him some cakes and that we do so
want him to come just as soon as he can

All right said Ben so he went to work laboriously only his
hard breathing showing what a hard task it was as the stiff old pen
scratched up and down the paper

There thats done he cried at length in great satisfaction holding
it up for inspection

Oh I do wish cried Polly in intense admiration I could write so
nice and so fast as you can Ben

Read it Polly said Mrs Pepper in pride

So Polly began Dear Mister Jasper we were all dreadfully sorry
that you didnt come and so we baked you some cakesYou didnt say
anything about his being sick Ben

I forgot it said Ben but I put it in farther downyoull see if
you read on

Baked you some cakesthat is Polly did for this is Ben thats
writing

You neednt said that Ben said Polly dissatisfied we all baked
em Im sure And just as soon as you get well we do want you to come
over and have the baking Were real sorry youre sickbonesets good
for colds

Oh Ben said Mrs Pepper I guess his father knows what to give
him

And oh the bitter stuff cried Polly with a wry face Well its
hard work to write said Ben yawning Id rather chop wood

I wish knew how exclaimed Joel longingly

Just you try every day Benll teach you Joe said his mother
eagerly and then Ill let you write

I will cried Joe then Dave youll see how Ill writeI tell
you

And Im goin toma cant I said Davie unwilling to be outdone

Yes you may be sure said Mrs Pepper delighted thatll make a
man of you fast

Oh boys said Polly lifting a very red face you joggle the table
so I cant do anything

I wasnt jogglin said Joel the old thing tipped Look he
whispered to Davie see Polly shes writing crooked

So while the others hung around her and looked over her shoulder while
they made their various comments Polly finished her part and also held
it up for inspection

Let us see said Ben taking it up

Its after bonesets good for colds said Polly puckering up her
face again at the thought

We most of us knew you were sickIm Polly nowbecause you didnt
come and we liked your letter telling us so Oh Polly we werent glad
to hear he was sick cried Ben in horror

I didnt say so cried Polly starting up Why Ben Pepper I never
said so and she looked ready to cry

It sounds something like it dont it mammy said Ben unwilling to
give her pain but appealing to Mrs Pepper

Polly didnt mean it said her mother consolingly but if I were you
Id say something to explain it

I cant put anything in now said poor Polly there isnt any room
nor any more paper eitherwhat shall I do I told you Ben I couldnt
write And Polly looked helplessly from one to the other for comfort

Yes you can said Ben there now Ill show you write it fine
Pollyyou write so biglittle bits of letters like these

So Polly took the pen again with a sigh Now he wont think so I
guess she said much relieved as Ben began to read again

Ill begin yours again Ben said We most of us knew you were sick
because you didnt come and we liked your letter telling us so because
wed all felt so badly and Phronsie cried herself to sleep thats
good Im sure The gingerbread boy is for your fatherplease
excuse it but Phronsie would make it for him because he is sick There
isnt any more to write and besides I cant write good and Bens
tired From all of us

Why hows he to know cried Ben That wont do to sign it

Well lets say from Ben and Polly then said Polly only all the
others want to be in the letter

Well they cant write said Ben

We might sign their names for em suggested Polly

Heres mine said Ben putting under the From all of us a big bold
Ben

And heres mine echoed Polly setting a slightly crooked Polly by
its side

Now Joe you better let Ben hold your hand said Polly warningly But
Joel declaring he could write had already begun so there was no hope
for it and a big drop of ink falling from the pen he spattered the J
so that no one could tell what it was The children looked at each other
in despair

Can we ever get it out mammy said Polly running to Mrs Pepper with
it

I dont know said her mother How could you try it Joe

I didnt mean to said Joel looking very downcast and ashamed The
ugly old pen did it

Well said Polly its got to go we cant help it But she looked
so sorrowful over it that half the pleasure was gone for Ben for Polly
wanted everything just right and was very particular about things

Now Dave Ben held his hand and David went down next to Joel

But when it was Phronsies turn she protested that Polly and no one
else must hold her hand

Its a dreadful hard name to writePhronsie is said Polly as she
guided Phronsies fat little hand that clung faithfully to the stubby
old pen There its over now she cried and Im thankful I
wouldnt write another for anything

Read it all over now Ben cried Mrs Pepper and dont speak
children till he gets through

Dont it sound elegant said Polly clasping her hands when he had
finished I didnt think we ever could do it so nice did you Ben

No indeed I didnt replied Ben in a highly ecstatic frame of mind
Nowoh whatll we do for an envelope he asked in dismay

Youll have to do without that said Mrs Pepper for there isnt any
in the housebut see here children she added as she saw the sorry
faces before heryou just fold up the letter and put it inside the
parcel thatll be just as good

Oh dear said Polly but it would have been splendid the other way
mammyjust like other folks

You must make believe this is like other folks said Mrs Pepper
cheerily when you cant do any other way

Yes said Ben thats so Polly tie em up quicks you can and Ill
take em over to Deacon Blodgetts for hes goin to start early in the
morning

So after another last look all around Polly put the cakes in the paper
and tied it with four or five strong knots to avoid all danger of its
undoing

He neverll untie it Polly said Ben thats just like a girls
knots

Why didnt you tie it then said Polly Im sure its as good as
a boys knots and they always muss up a parcel so And she gave a
loving approving little pat to the top of the package which despite
its multitude of knots was certainly very neat indeed

Ben grasping the pen again here goes for the direction

Deary yes said Polly I forgot all about that I thought twas
done

Howd you spose hed get it asked Ben coolly beginning the M

I dont know replied Polly looking over his shoulder spose
anybody else had eaten em up Ben And she turned pale at the very
thought

There said Ben at last after a good many flourishes now tis
done you cant think of another thing to do to it Polly

Mamsie see cried Polly running with it to Mrs Pepper isnt that
fine Mr Jasper E King at the Hotel Hingham

Yes said Mrs Pepper admiringly to the content of all the children
I should think it was

Let me take it in my hand screamed Joel reaching eagerly up for the
tempting brown parcel

Be careful then Joe said Polly with an important air So Joel took
a comfortable feel and then Davie must have the same privilege At
last it was off and with intense satisfaction the children watched Ben
disappear with it down the long hill to Deacon Blodgetts

The next day Ben came running in from his work at the deacons

Oh Polly you had em he screamed all out of breath You had em

Had what asked Polly in astonishment Oh Bensie what do you mean

Your flowers he panted You sent some flowers to Jasper

Flowers to Jasper repeated Polly afraid Ben had gone out of his
wits

Yes said Ben Ill begin at the beginning You see Polly when I
went down this morning Betsey was to set me to work Deacon Blodgett
and Mrs Blodgett had started early you know and while I was
acleanin up the woodshed as she told me all of a sudden she said
as she stood in the door looking on Oh Ben Mis Blodgett took some
posies along with your parcel What said I I didnt know as Id
heard straight Posies I said says Betsey beautiful ones they
were too the best in the garding I heard her tell Mr Blodgett it
would be a pity if that sick boy couldnt have some flowers and she
knew the Pepper children were crazy about em so she twisted em in
the string around the parcel and there they stood up and looked fine I
tell you as they drove away So Polly

Bensie Pepper cried Polly taking hold of his jacket and spinning
him round I told you so I told you so

I know you did said Ben as she gave him a parting whirl an I wish
youd say so about other things Polly if you can get em so easy




JOLLY DAYS


Oh Ben cried Jasper overtaking him by a smart run as he was turning
in at the little brown gate one morning three days after do wait

Halloa cried Ben turning around and setting down his loada bag of
salt and a basket of potatoesand viewing Jasper and Prince with great
satisfaction

Yes here I am said Jasper And how Ive run that fellow on the
stage was awful slow in getting hereoh youre so good he said
and his eyes brimful of gladness beamed on Ben The cakes were just
prime and twas great fun to get your letter

Did you like it asked Ben the color up all over his brown
faceLike it cried Jasper Why twas just splendid and the cakes
were royal Isnt Polly smart though to bake like that he added
admiringly

I guess she is said Ben drawing himself up to his very tallest
dimensions She knows how to do everything Jasper King

I should think she did responded the boy quickly I wish she was my
sister he finished longingly

Well I dont quickly replied Ben for then she wouldnt be mine
and I couldnt think of being without Polly Was your father angry
aboutaboutthe gingerbread boy he asked timidly trembling for an
answer

Oh dear cried Jasper tumbling over on the grass dont dont I
shant be good for anything if you make me laugh oh wasnt it funny
and he rolled over and over shaking with glee

Yes said Ben immensely relieved to find that no offence had been
taken But she would send it Polly tried not to have her and she
most cried when Phronsie was so determined cause she said your father
neverd let you come again

Twas just lovely in Phronsie said the boy sitting up and wiping his
eyes but oh it was so funny you ought to have seen my father Ben
Pepper

Oh then he was angry cried Ben

No indeed he wasnt said Jasper dont you think it do you know it
did him lots of good for hed been feeling real badly that morning he
hadnt eaten any breakfast and when he saw that gingerbread boy
here Jasper rolled over again with a peal of laughterand heard the
message he just put back his head and he laughedwhy I never heard
him laugh as he did then the room shook all over and he ate a big
dinner and all that afternoon he felt as good as could be But he says
hes coming to see the little girl that baked it for him before we go
home

Ben nearly tumbled over by the side of Jasper at these wordsComing to
see us he gasped

Yes said Jasper who had scarcely got over his own astonishment about
it for if the roof had suddenly whisked off on to the church steeple
he couldnt have been more amazed than when he heard his father say
cheerily Well Jasper my boy I guess I shall have to drive over and
see your little girl since shes been polite enough to bake me this
pointing to the wildlooking gingerbread boy

Come in and tell em about it cried Ben radiantly picking up his
potatoes and salt Its all right Polly he said in a jubilant voice
for heres Jasper and hell tell you so himself

Hush said Jasper warningly dont let Phronsie hear well heres
my pet now and after bobbing lovingly to the others with eyes beaming
over with fun he caught up the little girl who was screamingOh
heres Jasper and my beyewtiful doggie

Now Phronsie he cried give me a kiss you havent any soft soap
today have you no thats a good nice one now your gingerbread
boy was just splendid

Did he eat it asked the child in grave delight

Wellnohe hasnt eaten it yet said Jasper smiling on the others
hes keeping it to look at Phronsie

I should think so groaned Polly

Never mind Polly Ben whispered Jaspers been atellin me about
it his father liked ithe did truly

Oh said Polly Im so glad

He had eyes said Phronsie going back to the charms of the
gingerbread boy

I know it said Jasper admiringly so he did

Rather deep sunk one of em was muttered Ben

And Ill bake you one Jasper said the child as he put her down I
will very trulysome day

Will you smiled Jasper well then and there was a whispered
conference with Phronsie that somehow sent that damsel into a blissful
state of delight And then while Phronsie monopolized Prince Jasper
told them all about the reception of the parcelhow very dull and
forlorn he was feeling that morning Prince and he shut up indoorsand
how his father had had a miserable night and had eaten scarcely no
breakfast and just at this juncture there came a knock at the door
and said Jasper your parcel walked in all dressed up in flowers

They werent our flowers said Polly honestly Mrs Blodgett put em
on

Well she couldnt have if you hadnt sent the parcel said Jasper in
a tone of conviction

Then he launched out into a description of how they opened the
packagePrince looking on and begging for one of the cakes

Oh didnt you give him one cried Polly at this Good old Prince

Yes I did said Jasper the biggest one of all

The one I guess interrupted Joel with the big raisin on top

Polly spoke up quickly to save any more remarks on Joels part Now
tell us about your fatherand the gingerbread boy

So Jasper broke out with a merry laugh into this part of the story
and soon had them all in such a gale of merriment that Phronsie stopped
playing out on the doorstep with Prince and came in to see what the
matter was

Never mind said Polly trying to get her breath just as Jasper was
relating how Mr King set up the gingerbread boy on his writing table
before him while he leaned back in his chair for a hearty laugh

And to make it funnier still said Jasper dont you think a little
penwiper he has made like a cap hanging on the penrack above him
tumbled off just at this very identical minute right on the head of the
gingerbread boy and there it stuck

Oh they all screamed if we could only have seen it

What was it asked Phronsie pulling Pollys sleeve to make her hear

So Jasper took her in his lap and told how funny the gingerbread boy
looked with a cap on and Phronsie clapped her hands and laughed with
the rest till the little old kitchen rang and rang again

And then they had the baking and Polly tied one of her mothers ample
aprons on Jasper as Mrs Pepper had left directions if he should come
while she was away and he developed such a taste for cookery and had
so many splendid improvements on the Peppers simple ideas that the
children thought it the most fortunate thing in the world that he came
and one and all voted him a most charming companion

You could cook a Thanksgiving dinner in this stove just as easy as
not said Jasper putting into the oven something on a little cracked
plate that would have been a pie if there were any centre but lacking
that necessary accompaniment probably was a shortcake Just as easy
as not he repeated with emphasis slamming the door to give point to
his remarks

No you couldnt either said Ben at the table with equal decision
not a bit of it Jasper King

Why Ben Pepper asked Jasper that ovens big enough I should like
to know why not

Cause there isnt anything to cook said Ben coolly cutting out a
piece of dough for a jumble we dont keep Thanksgiving

Not keep Thanksgiving said Jasper standing quite still never had a
Thanksgiving well I declare and then he stopped again

Yes answered Ben we had one once twas last yearbut that wasnt
much

Well then said Jasper leaning over the table Ill tell you what I
should think youd dotry Christmas

Oh thats always worse said Polly setting down her rollingpin to
thinkwhich immediately rolled away by itself off from the table

We never had a Christmas said little Davie reflectively what are
they like Jasper

Jasper sat quite still and didnt reply to this question for a moment
or two

To be among children who didnt like Thanksgiving and who never
had seen a Christmas and didnt know what it was like was a new
revelation to him

They hang up stockings said Polly softly

How many many times she had begged her mother to try it for the younger
ones but there was never anything to put in them and the winters were
cold and hard and the strictest economy only carried them through

Oh said little Phronsie in horror are their feet in em Polly

No dear said Polly while Jasper instead of laughing only stared
Something requiring a deal of thought was passing through the boys mind
just then They shall have a Christmas he muttered I know fatherll
let me But he kept his thoughts to himself and becoming his own gay
kindly self he explained and told to Phronsie and the others so many
stories of past Christmases he had enjoyed that the interest over the
baking soon dwindled away until a horrible smell of something burning
brought them all to their senses

Oh the house is burning cried Polly Oh get a pail of water

Tisnt either said Jasper snuffing wisely oh I knowI forgot all
about itI do beg your pardon And running to the stove he knelt
down and drew out of the oven a black odorous mass which with a
crestfallen air he brought to Polly

Im no end sorry I made such a mess of it he said I meant it for
you

Tisnt any matter said Polly kindly

And now do you go on cried Joel and David both in the same breath
all about the Tree you know

Yes yes said the others if youre not tired Jasper

Oh no cried their accommodating friend I love to tell about it
only waitlets help Polly clear up first

So after all traces of the frolic had been tidied up and made nice for
the mothers return they took seats in a circle and Jasper regaled
them with story and reminiscence till they felt as if fairy land were
nothing to it

How did you ever live through it Jasper King said Polly drawing the
first long breath she had dared to indulge in Such an elegant time

Jasper laughed I hope Ill live through plenty more of them he said
merrily Were going to sister Marians again father and I we always
spend our Christmas there you know and shes to have all the cousins
and I dont know how many more and a treebut the best of all theres
going to be a German carol sung by choir boysI shall like that best of
all

What are choir boys asked Polly who was intensely fond of music

In some of the churches explained Jasper the choir is all boys and
they do chant and sing anthems perfectly beautifully Polly

Do you play on the piano and sing asked Polly looking at him in
awe

Yes said the boy simply Ive played ever since I was a little
fellow no biggern Phronsie

Oh Jasper cried Polly clasping her hands her cheeks all
aflamedo you mean to say you do really and truly play on the piano

Why yes said the boy looking into her flashing eyes Pollys
always crazy about music explained Ben shell drum on the table and
anywhere to make believe its a piano

Theres Dr Fisher going by said Joel who now that they had gotten
on the subject of music began to find prickles running up and down his
legs from sitting so still I wish hed stop

Is he the one that cured your measlesand Pollys eyes asked Jasper
running to the window I want to see him

Well there he is cried Ben as the doctor put his head out of the gig
and bowed and smiled to the little group in the window

Hes just lovely cried Polly oh I wish you knew him

If fathers sick again said Jasper well have himhe looks nice
anywayfor father dont like the doctor over in Hinghamdo you know
perhaps well come again next summer wouldnt that be nice

Oh cried the children rapturously do come Jasper do

Well maybe said Jasper if father likes it and sister Marian and
her family will come with us they do some summers Youd like little
Dick I know turning to Phronsie And I guess all of youd like all
of them he added looking at the group of interested listeners They
wanted to come this year awfully they saidOh grandpapa do let us go
with you and Jappy and

What said the children

Oh said Jasper with a laugh they call me Jappyits easier to say
than Jasper ever so many people do for short You may if you want to
he said looking around on them all

How funny laughed Polly But I dont know as it is any worse than
Polly or Ben

Or Phronsie said Jappy Dont you like Jappy he said bringing
his head down to her level as she sat on the little stool at his feet
content in listening to the merry chat

Is that the same as Jasper she asked gravely

Yes the very same he said

When they partedJappy and the little Peppers were sworn friends and
the boy happy in his good times in the cheery little home felt the
hours long between the visits that his father when he saw the change
that they wrought in his son willingly allowed him to make

Oh dear said Mrs Pepper one day in the last of Septemberas a
carriage drawn by a pair of very handsome horses stopped at their
door here comes Mr King I do believe we never looked worsen we do
today

I dont care said Polly flying out of the bedroom Jappys with
him mamma and itll be nice I guess At any rate Phronsies clean as
a pink she thought to herself looking at the little maiden busy with
baby to whom she was teaching deportment in the corner But there was
no time to fix up for a tall portly gentleman leaning on his
heavy gold cane was walking up from the little brown gate to the big
flatstone that served as a step Jasper and Prince followed decorously

Is this little Miss Pepper he asked pompously of Polly who answered
his rap on the door Now whether she was little Miss Pepper she never
had stopped to consider

I dont know sir Im Polly And then she blushed bright as a rose
and the laughing brown eyes looked beyond to Jasper who stood on the
walk and smiled encouragingly

Is your mother in asked the old gentleman who was so tall he could
scarcely enter the low door And then Mrs Pepper came forward and
Jasper introduced her and the old gentleman bowed and sat down in
the seat Polly placed for him And Mrs Pepper thanked him with a heart
overflowing with gratitude through lips that would tremble even
then for all that Jasper had done for them And the old gentleman
saidHumph but he looked at his son and something shone in his eye
just for a moment

Phronsie had retreated with baby in her arms behind the door on the
new arrival But seeing everything progressing finely and overcome by
her extreme desire to see Jappy and Prince she began by peeping out
with big eyes to observe how things were going on Just then the old
gentleman happened to say Well where is my little girl that baked me
a cake so kindly

Then Phronsie forgetting all else but her poor sick man who also was
Jaspers father rushed out from behind the door and coming up to the
stately old gentleman in the chair she looked up pityingly and said
shaking her yellow head Poor sick man was my boy good

After that there was no more gravity and ceremony In a moment Phronsie
was perched upon old Mr Kings knee and playing with his watch
while the others freed from all restraint were chatting and laughing
happily till some of the cheeriness overflowed and warmed the heart of
the old gentleman

We go tomorrow he said rising and looking at his watch Why is
it possible that we have been here an hour there my little girl
will you give me a kiss and he bent his handsome old head down to the
childish face upturned to his confidingly

Dont go said the child as she put up her little lips in grave
confidence I do like youI do

Oh Phronsie began Mrs Pepper

Dont reprove her madam said the old gentleman who liked it
immensely Yes we go tomorrow he said looking around on the group
to whom this was a blow they little expected They had surely thought
Jasper was to stay a week longer

I received a telegram this morning that I must be in the city on
Thursday And besides madam he said addressing Mrs Pepper I think
the climate is bad for me now as it induces rheumatism The hotel is
also getting unpleasant there are many annoyances that I cannot put up
with so that altogether I do not regret it

Mrs Pepper not knowing exactly what to say to this wisely said
nothing Meantime Jappy and the little Peppers were having a sorry time
over in the corner by themselves

Well Ill write cried Jasper not liking to look at Polly just then
as he was sure he shouldnt want anyone to look at him if he felt like
crying And you must answer em all

Oh we will we will they cried And Jappy do come next summer
said Joel

If fatherll only say yes we will I tell you he responded eagerly

Come my boy said his father the third time and Jasper knew by the
tone that there must be no delay

Mr King had been nervously putting his hand in his pocket during the
last few moments that the children were together but when he glanced
at Mrs Peppers eyes something made him draw it out again hastily
as empty as he put it in No twouldnt do he said to himself she
isnt the kind of woman to whom one could offer money

The children crowded back their tears and hastily said their last
goodbye some of them hanging on to Prince till the last moment

And then the carriage door shut with a bang Jasper giving them a bright
parting smile and they were gone

And the Peppers went into their little brown house and shut the door




GETTING A CHRISTMAS FOR THE LITTLE ONES


And so October came and went The little Peppers were very lonely after
Jasper had gone even Mrs Pepper caught herself looking up one day when
the wind blew the door open suddenly half expecting to see the merry
wholesouled boy and the faithful dog come scampering in

But the letters cameand that was a comfort and it was fun to answer
them The first one spoke of Jaspers being under a private tutor with
his cousins then they were less frequent and they knew he was studying
hard Full of anticipations of Christmas himself he urged the little
Peppers to try for one And the life and spirit of the letter was so
catching that Polly and Ben found their souls fired within them to try
at least to get for the little ones a taste of Christmastide

Now mammy they said at last one day in the latter part of October
when the crisp fresh air filled their little healthy bodies with
springing vitality that must bubble over and rush into something
we dont want a Thanksgivingtruly we dont But may we try for a
Christmasjust a little one they added timidly for the children
Ben and Polly always called the three younger ones of the flock the
children

To their utter surprise Mrs Pepper looked mildly assenting and
presently she said Well I dont see why you cant try twont do any
harm Im sure

You see Mrs Pepper had received a letter from Jasper which at present
she didnt feel called upon to say anything about

Now said Polly drawing a long breath as she and Ben stole away into
a corner to talk over and lay plans what does it mean

Never mind said Ben as long as shes given us leave I dont care
what it is

I neither said Polly with the delicious feeling as if the whole
world were before them where to choose itll be just gorgeous Ben

Whats that asked Ben who was not as much given to long words as
Polly who dearly loved to be fine in language as well as other things

Oh its something Jappy said one day and I asked him and he says
its fine and lovely and all that answered Polly delighted that she
knew something she could really tell Ben

Then why not say fine commented Ben practically with a little
upward lift of his nose

Oh Id know Im sure laughed Polly Lets think whatll we do
for Christmashow many weeks are there anyway Ben And she began to
count on her fingers

Thats no way said Ben Im going to get the Almanac So he went to
the old clock where hanging up by its side was a Farmers Almanac

Now well know he said coming back to their corner So with heads
together they consulted and counted up till they found that eight weeks
and three days remained in which to get ready

Dear me said Polly Its most a year isnt it Ben

Twont be much time for us said Ben who thought of the many hours
to be devoted to hard work that would run away with the time Wed
better begin right away Polly

Well all right said Polly who could scarcely keep her fingers
still as she thought of the many things she should so love to do if she
could But first Ben what lets do

Would you rather hang up their stockings asked Ben as if he had
unlimited means at his disposal or have a tree

Why said Polly with wide open eyes at the two magnificent ideas we
havent got anything to put in the stockings when we hang em Ben

Thats just it said Ben Now wouldnt it be better to have a tree
Polly I can get that easy in the woods you know

Well interrupted Polly eagerly we havent got anything to hang on
that either Ben You know Jappy said folks hang all sorts of presents
on the branches So I dont see she continued impatiently as
thats any good We cant do anything Ben Pepper so there there isnt
anything to do anything with and with a flounce Polly sat down on
the old wooden stool and folding her hands looked at Ben in a most
despairing way

I know said Ben we havent got much

We havent got anything said Polly still looking at him Why weve
got a tree replied Ben hopefully Well whats a tree retorted
Polly scornfully Anybody can go out and look at a tree outdoors

Well now I tell you Polly said Ben sitting down on the floor
beside her and speaking very slowly and decisively weve got to do
something cause weve begun and we might make a tree real pretty

How asked Polly ashamed of her illhumor but not in the least
seeing how anything could be made of a tree How Ben Pepper

Well said Ben pleasantly wed set it up in the corner

Oh no not in the corner cried Polly whose spirits began to rise
a little as she saw Ben so hopeful Put it in the middle of the room
do

I dont care where you put it said Ben smiling happy that Pollys
usual cheerful energy had returned but I thoughttwill be a little
one you know and I thought twould look better in the corner

What else asked Polly eager to see how Ben would dress the tree

Well said Ben you know the Henderson boys gave me a lot of corn
last week

I dont see as that helps much said Polly still incredulous Do you
mean hang the cobs on the branches Ben That would be just dreadful

I should think likely laughed Ben No indeed Polly Pepper but
if we should pop a lot oh a bushel and then we should string em we
could wind it all in and out among the branches and

Why wouldnt that be pretty cried Polly real prettyand we can do
that Im sure

Yes continued Ben and then dont you know theres some little
candle ends in that box in the Provision Room maybe mammyd give us
them

I dont believe but she would cried Polly twould be just like
Jappys if she would Lets ask her nowthis very same minute

And they scampered hurriedly to Mrs Pepper who to their extreme
astonishment after all said yes and smiled encouragingly on the
plan

Isnt mammy good said Polly with loving gratitude as they seated
themselves again

Now were all right exclaimed Ben and I tell you we can make the
tree look perfectly splendid Polly Pepper

And Ill tell you another thing Ben Polly said oh something
elegant You must get ever so many hickory nuts and you know those bits
of bright paper Ive got in the bureau drawer Well we can paste them
on to the nuts and hang em on for the balls Jappy tells of

Polly cried Ben itll be such a tree as never was wont it

Yes but dear me cried Polly springing up the children are coming
Wasnt it good grandma wanted em to come over this afternoon sos
we could talk Now hush as the door opened to admit the noisy little
troop

If you think of any new plan whispered Ben behind his hand while
Mrs Pepper engaged their attention youll have to come out into the
woodshed to talk after this

I know it whispered Polly back again oh weve got just heaps of
things to think of Bensie

Such a contriving and racking of brains as Polly and Ben set up after
this They would bob over at each other and smile with significant
gesture as a new idea would strike one of them in the most mysterious
way that if observed would drive the others almost wild And then
frightened lest in some hilarious moment the secret should pop out
the two conspirators would betake themselves to the woodshed as before
agreed on But Joel finding this out followed them one dayor as
Polly said taggedso that was no good

Lets go behind the woodpile she said to Ben in desperation he
cant hear there if we whisper real soft

Yes he will said Ben who knew Joels hearing faculties much better
Well have to wait till theyre abed

So after that when nightfall first began to make its appearance Polly
would hint mildly about bedtime

You hustle us so said Joel after he had been sent off to bed for two
or three nights unusually early

Oh Joey its good for you to get to bed said Polly coaxingly
itll make you grow you know real fast

Well I dont grow abed grumbled Joel who thought something was in
the wind You and Ben are going to talk I know and wink your eyes as
soon as were gone

Well go along Joe thats a good boy said Polly laughing and
youll know some day

Whatll you give me asked Joel seeing a bargain his foot on the
lowest stair leading to the loft say Polly

Oh I havent got much to give she said cheerily but Ill tell you
what JoeyIll tell you a story every day that you go to bed

Will you cried Joe hopping back into the room Begin now Polly
begin now

Why you havent been to bed yet said Polly so I cant till
tomorrow

Yes I haveyouve made us go for threeno I guess fourteen nights
said Joel indignantly

Well you were made to go laughed Polly I said if youd go good
you know so run along Joe and Ill tell you a nice one tomorrow

Its got to be long shouted Joel when he saw he could get no more
making good time up to the loft

To say that Polly in the following days was Master Joels slave was
stating the case lightly However she thought by her storytelling she
got off easily as each evening saw the boys drag their unwilling
feet tobedward and leave Ben and herself in peace to plan and work
undisturbed There they would sit by the little old table around the
one tallow candle while Mrs Pepper sewed away busily looking up to
smile or to give some bits of advice keeping her own secret meanwhile
which made her blood leap fast as the happy thoughts nestled in her
heart of her little ones and their coming glee And Polly made the
loveliest of paper dolls for Phronsie out of the rest of the bits of
bright paper and Ben made windmills and whistles for the boys and a
funny little carved basket with a handle for Phronsie out of a hickory
nut shell and a new pink calico dress for Seraphina peered out from
the top drawer of the old bureau in the bedroom whenever anyone opened
itfor Mrs Pepper kindly let the children lock up their treasures
there as fast as completed

Ill make Seraphina a bonnet said Mrs Pepper for theres that old
bonnetstring in the bag you know Polly thatll make it beautiful

Oh do mother cried Polly shes been wanting a new one awfully

And Im going to knit some mittens for Joel and David continued Mrs
Pepper cause I can get the yarn cheap now I saw some down at the
store yesterday I could have at half price

I dont believe anybodyll have as good a Christmas as we shall cried
Polly pasting on a bit of trimming to the gayest dolls dress no not
even Jappy

An odd little smile played around Mrs Peppers mouth but she said not
a word and so the fun and the work went on

The tree was to be set up in the Provision Room that was finally
decided as Mrs Pepper showed the children how utterly useless it would
be to try having it in the kitchen

Ill find the key children she said I think I know where tis and
then we can keep them out

Well but it looks so said Polly demurring at the prospect

Oh no Polly said her mother at any rate its clean

Polly said Ben we can put evergreen around you know

So we can said Polly brightly oh Ben you do think of the best
things we couldnt have had them in the kitchen

And dont lets hang the presents on the tree continued Ben lets
have the children hang up their stockings they want to awfullyfor I
heard David tell Joel this morning before we got upthey thought I
was asleep but I wasntthat he did so wish they could but says he
Dont tell mammy cause thatll make her feel bad

The little dears said Mrs Pepper impulsively they shall have
their stockings too

And well make the tree pretty enough said Polly enthusiastically
we shant want the presents to hang on weve got so many things And
then well have hickory nuts to eat and perhaps mammyll let us make
some molasses candy the day before she said with a sly look at her
mother

You may said Mrs Pepper smiling

Oh goody they both cried hugging each other ecstatically

And well have a frolic in the Provision Room afterwards finished
Polly oh ooh

And so the weeks flew byone two three four five six seven
eight till only the three days remained and to think the fun that
Polly and Ben had had already

Its bettern a Christmas they told their mother to get ready for
it

Its too bad you cant hang up your stockings said Mrs Pepper
looking keenly at their flushed faces and bright eyes youve never
hung em up

That isnt any matter mamsie they both said cheerily its a
great deal better to have the children have a nice timeoh wont it be
elegant praps well have ours next year

For two days before the house was turned upside down for Joel to find
the biggest stocking he could but on Polly telling him it must be his
own he stopped his search and bringing down his wellworn one hung it
by the corner of the chimney to be ready

You put yours up the other side Dave he advised

There isnt any nail cried David investigating

Ill drive one said Joel so he ran out to the toolhouse as one
corner of the woodshed was called and brought in the hammer and one or
two nails

Phronsies agoin in the middle he said with a nail in his mouth

Yes Im agoin to hang up my stockin cried the child hopping from
one toe to the other

Run get it Phronsie said Joel and Ill hang it up for you

Why its two days before Christmas yet said Polly laughing how
theyll look hanging there so long

I dont care said Joel giving a last thump to the nail were
agoin to be ready Oh dear I wish twas tonight

Cant Seraphina hang up her stocking asked Phronsie coming up to
Pollys side and Baby too

Oh let her have part of yours said Polly thatll be
bestSeraphina and Baby and you have one stocking together

Oh yes cried Phronsie easily pleased thatll be best So for
the next two days they were almost distracted the youngest ones asking
countless questions about Santa Claus and how he possibly could get
down the chimney Joel running his head up as far as he dared to see if
it was big enough

I guess he can he said coming back in a sooty state looking very
much excited and delighted

Will he be black like Joey asked Phronsie pointing to his grimy
face

No said Polly he dont ever get black

Why they all asked and then over and over they wanted the
delightful mystery explained

We neverll get through this day said Polly in despair as the last
one arrived I wish twas tonight for were all ready

Santys coming Santys coming sang Phronsie as the bright afternoon
sunlight went down over the fresh crisp snow for its night now

Yes Santa is coming sang Polly and Santa Claus is coming rang
back and forth through the old kitchen till it seemed as if the three
little old stockings would hop down and join in the dance going on so
merrily

Im glad mine is red said Phronsie at last stopping in the wild
jig and going up to see if it was all safe cause then Santyll know
its mine wont he Polly

Yes dear cried Polly catching her up Oh Phronsie you are going
to have a Christmas

Well I wish said Joel I had my name on mine I know Davell get
some of my things

Oh no Joe said Mrs Pepper Santa Claus is smart hell know yours
is in the lefthand corner

Will he asked Joel still a little fearful

Oh yes indeed said Mrs Pepper confidently I never knew him to
make a mistake

Now said Ben when they had all made a pretence of eating supper
for there was such an excitement prevailing that no one sat still long
enough to eat much you must every one fly off to bed as quick as ever
can be

Will Santa Claus come faster then asked Joel

Yes said Ben just twice as fast

Im going then said Joel but I aint going to sleep cause I mean
to hear him come over the roof then Im going to get up for I do so
want a squint at the reindeer

I am too cried Davie excitedly Oh do come Joe and he began to
mount the stairs

Good night said Phronsie going up to the centre of the
chimneypiece where the little red stocking dangled limpsily lift me
up Polly do

What you want to do asked Polly running and giving her a jump What
you goin to do Phronsie

I want to kiss it good night said the child with eyes big with
anticipation and happiness hugging the well worn toe of the little old
stocking affectionately I wish I had something to give Santa Polly I
do she cried as she held her fast in her arms

Never mind Pet said Polly nearly smothering her with kisses if
youre a good girl Phronsie that pleases Santa the most of anything

Does it cried Phronsie delighted beyond measure as Polly carried
her into the bedroom then Ill be good always I will




CHRISTMAS BELLS


In the middle of the night Polly woke up with a start

What in the world said she and she bobbed up her head and looked
over at her mother who was still peacefully sleeping and was just
going to lie down again when a second noise out in the kitchen made her
pause and lean on her elbow to listen At this moment she thought she
heard a faint whisper and springing out of bed she ran to Phronsies
cribit was empty As quick as a flash she sped out into the kitchen
There in front of the chimney were two figures One was Joel and the
other unmistakably was Phronsie

What are you doing gasped Polly holding on to a chair

The two little nightgowns turned around at this

Why I thought it was morning said Joel and I wanted my stocking
Oh as he felt the toe which was generously stuffed give it to me
Polly Pepper and Ill run right back to bed again

Dear me said Polly and you too Phronsie Why its the middle of
the night Did I ever and she had to pinch her mouth together tight
to keep from bursting out into a loud laugh Oh dear I shall laugh
dont look so scared Phronsie there wont anything hurt you For
Phronsie who on hearing Joel fumbling around the precious stockings
had been quite willing to hop out of bed and join him had now on
Pollys saying the dire words in the middle of the night scuttled
over to her protecting side like a frightened rabbit

It neverll be morning said Joel taking up first one cold toe and
then the other you might let us have em now Polly

No said Polly sobering down you cant have yours till Davie wakes
up too Scamper off to bed Joey dear and forget all about emand
itll be morning before you know it

Oh Id rather go to bed said Phronsie trying to tuck up her feet in
the little flannel nightgown which was rather short but I dont know
the way back Polly Take me Polly do and she put up her arms to be
carried

Oh I aint agoin back alone either whimpered Joel coming up to
Polly too

Why you came down alone didnt you whispered Polly with a little
laugh

Yes but I thought twas morning said Joel his teeth chattering with
something beside the cold

Well you must think of the morning thats coming said Polly
cheerily Ill tell youyou wait till I put Phronsie into the crib
and then Ill come back and go halfway up the stairs with you

I wont never come down till its mornin again said Joel bouncing
along the stairs when Polly was ready to go with him at a great rate

Better not laughed Polly softly Be careful and not wake Davie nor
Ben

Im in announced Joel in a loud whisper and Polly could hear him
snuggle down among the warm bedclothes Call us when tis mornin
Polly

Yes said Polly I will go to sleep

Phronsie had forgotten stockings and everything else on Pollys return
and was fast asleep in the old crib The result of it was that the
children slept over when morning did really come and Polly had to
keep her promise and go to the foot of the stairs and callMERRY
CHRISTMAS oh Ben and Joel and Davie

Ohohooh and then the sounds that answered her as with
smothered whoops of expectation they one and all flew into their
clothes

Quick as a flash Joel and Davie were down and dancing around the
chimney

Mammy mammy screamed Phronsie hugging her stocking which Ben
lifted her up to unhook from the big nail Santy did come he did and
then she spun around in the middle of the floor not stopping to look in
it

Well open it Phronsie called Davie deep in the exploring of his
own oh isnt that a splendid windmill Joe

Yes said that individual who having found a big piece of molasses
candy was so engaged in enjoying a huge bite that regardless alike of
his other gifts or of the smearing his face was getting he gave himself
wholly up to its delights

Oh Joey cried Polly laughingly molasses candy for breakfast

Thats prime cried Joel swallowing the last morsel Now Im going
to see whats thisoh Dave see here see here he cried in intense
excitement pulling out a nice little parcel which unrolled proved to
be a bright pair of stout mittens See if youve got somelook quick

Yes I have said David picking up a parcel about as big No thats
molasses candy

Just the same as I had said Joel do look for the mittens Praps
Santa Claus thought you had someoh dear

Here they are screamed Davie I have got some Joe just exactly
like yours See Joe

Goody said Joel immensely relieved for now he could quite enjoy his
to see a pair on Davies hands also Look at Phron he cried she
hasnt got only half of her things out

To tell the truth Phronsie was so bewildered by her riches that she
sat on the floor with the little red stocking in her lap laughing and
cooing to herself amid the few things she had drawn out When she came
to Seraphinas bonnet she was quite overcome She turned it over and
over and smoothed out the little white feather that had once adorned
one of Grandma Bascoms chickens until the two boys with their
stockings and the others sitting around in a group on the floor
watching them laughed in glee to see her enjoyment

Oh dear said Joel at last shaking his stocking Ive got all
there is I wish there were forty Christmases coming

I havent screamed Davie theres some thing in the toe

Its an apple I guess said Joel turn it up Dave

Tisnt an apple exclaimed Davie tisnt roundits long and thin
here tis And he pulled out a splendid long whistle on which he blew
a blast long and terrible and Joel immediately following all quiet was
broken up and the wildest hilarity reigned

I dont know as youll want any breakfast at last said Mrs Pepper
when she had got Phronsie a little sobered down

I do I do cried Joel

Dear me after your candy said Polly

Thats all gone said Joel tooting around the table on his whistle
What are we going to have for breakfast

Same as ever said his mother it cant be Christmas all the time

I wish twas said little Davie forever and ever

Forever an ever echoed little Phronsie flying up her cheeks like
two pinks and Seraphina in her arms with her bonnet on upside down

Dear dear said Polly pinching Ben to keep still as they tumbled
down the little rickety steps to the Provision Room after breakfast
The children content in their treasures were holding high carnival in
the kitchen Suppose they should find it out nowI declare I should
feel most awfully Isnt it elegant she asked in a subdued whisper
going all around and around the tree magnificent in its dress of bright
red and yellow balls white festoons and little candleends all ready
for lighting Oh Ben did you lock the door

Yes he said Thats a mouse he added as a little rustling noise
made Polly stop where she stood back of the tree and prick up her ears
in great distress of mind Tis elegant he said turning around
in admiration and taking in the tree which as Polly said was quite
gorgeous and the evergreen branches twisted up on the beams and
rafters and all the other festive arrangements Even Jappys isnt
better I dont believe

I wish Jappy was here said Polly with a small sigh

Well he isnt said Ben come we must go back into the kitchen or
all the children will be out here Look your last Polly twont do to
come again till its time to light up

Mammy says shed rather do the lighting up said Polly Had she
said Ben in surprise oh I suppose shes afraid well set somethin
afire Well then we shant come in till we have it

I cant bear to go said Polly turning reluctantly away its most
beautifuloh Ben and she faced him for the fivehundredth time with
the question is your Santa Claus dress all safe

Yes said Ben Ill warrant they wont find that in one hurry Such a
time as weve had to make it

I know it laughed Polly dont that cotton wool look just like bits
of fur Ben

Yes said Ben and when the flours shaken over me itll be Santa
himself

Weve got to put back the hair into mamsies cushion the first thing
tomorrow whispered Polly anxiously and we mustnt forget it
Bensie

I want to keep the wig awfully said Ben You did make that just
magnificent Polly

If you could see yourself giggled Polly did you put it in the straw
bed and are you sure you pulled the ticking over it smooth

Yes sir replied Ben sures my names Ben Pepper if youll only
keep them from seeing me when Im in it till were readythats all I
ask

Well said Polly a little relieved but I hope Joe wont look

Come on theyre acomin whispered Ben quick

Polly rang a voice dangerously near so near that Polly speeding
over the stairs to intercept it nearly fell on her nose

Where you been asked one

Lets have a concert put in Ben Polly was so out of breath that she
couldnt speak Come now each take a whistle and well march round
and round and see which can make the biggest noise

In the rattle and laughter which this procession made all mystery was
forgotten and the two conspirators began to breathe freer

Five oclock The small ones of the Pepper flock being pretty well
tired out with noise and excitement all gathered around Polly and Ben
and clamored for a story

Do Polly do begged Joel Its Christmas and twont come again
for a year

I cant said Polly in such a twitter that she could hardly stand
still and for the first time in her life refusing I cant think of a
thing

I will then said Ben we must do something he whispered to Polly

Tell it good said Joel settling himself

So for an hour the small tyrants kept their entertainers well employed

Isnt it growing awful dark said Davie rousing himself at last as
Ben paused to take breath

Polly pinched Ben

Mammys agoin to let us know he whispered in reply We must keep
on a little longer

Dont stop said Joel lifting his head where he sat on the floor
What you whisperin for Polly

Im not said Polly glad to think she hadnt spoken

Well do go on Ben said Joel lying down again

Pollyll have to finish it said Ben Ive got to go upstairs now

So Polly launched out into such an extravagant story that they all
perforce had to listen

All this time Mrs Pepper had been pretty busy in her way And now she
came into the kitchen and set down her candle on the table Children
she said Everybody turned and looked at herher tone was so strange
and when they saw her dark eyes shining with such a new light little
Davie skipped right out into the middle of the room Whats the matter
mammy

You may all come into the Provision Room said she

What for shouted Joel in amazement while the others jumped to their
feet and stood staring

Polly flew around like a general arranging her forces Lets march
there said she Phronsie you take hold of Davies hand and go
first

Im goin first announced Joel squeezing up past Polly No
you mustnt Joe said Polly decidedly Phronsie and David are the
youngest

Theyre always the youngest said Joel falling back with Polly to the
rear

Forward MARCH sang Polly Follow mamsie

Down the stairs they went with military step and into the Provision
Room And then with one wild look the little battalion broke ranks
and tumbling one over the other in decidedly unmilitary style presented
a very queer appearance

And Captain Polly was the queerest of all for she just gave one gaze at
the tree and then sat right down on the floor and said Oh OH

Mrs Pepper was flying around delightedly and saying Please to come
right in and How do you do

And before anybody knew it there were the laughing faces of Mrs
Henderson and the Parson himself Doctor Fisher and old Grandma Bascom
while the two Henderson boys unwilling to be defrauded of any of the
fun were squeezing themselves in between everybody else and coming up
to Polly every third minute and saying Therearent you surprised

Its Fairyland cried little Davie out of his wits with joy Oh
arent we in Fairyland ma

The whole room was in one buzz of chatter and fun and everybody beamed
on everybody else and nobody knew what they said till Mrs Pepper
called Hush Santa Claus is coming

A rattle at the little old window made everybody look there just as a
great snowwhite head popped up over the sill

Oh screamed Joel tis Santy

Hes acomin in cried Davie in chorus which sent Phronsie flying
to Polly In jumped a little old man quite spry for his years with
a jolly red face and a pack on his back and flew into their midst
prepared to do his duty but what should he do instead of making his
speech this jolly Old Saint but first fly up to Mrs Pepper and
sayOh mammy how did you do it

Its Ben screamed Phronsie but the little Old Saint didnt hear
for he and Polly took hold of hands and pranced around that tree while
everybody laughed till they cried to see them go

And then it all came out

Order said Parson Henderson in his deepest tones and then he put
into Santa Claus hands a letter which he requested him to read
And the jolly Old Saint although he was very old didnt need any
spectacles but piped out in Bens loudest tones

Dear FriendsA Merry Christmas to you all And that youll have a good
time and enjoy it all as much as Ive enjoyed my good times at your
house is the wish of your friend

JASPER ELYOT KING

Hurrah for Jappy cried Santa Claus pulling his beard and Hurrah
for Jasper went all around the room and this ended in three good
cheersPhronsie coming in too late with her little crowwhich was just
as well however

Do your duty now Santa Claus commanded Dr Fisher as master of
ceremonies and everything was as still as a mouse

And the first thing she knew a lovely brass cage with a dear little
bird with two astonished black eyes dropped down into Pollys hands The
card on it said For Miss Polly Pepper to give her music everyday in
the year

Mammy said Polly and then she did the queerest thing of the whole
she just burst into tears I never thought I should have a bird for my
very own

Hulloa said Santa Claus Ive got something myself

Santa Claus clothes are too old laughed Dr Fisher holding up a
stout warm suit that a boy about as big as Ben would delight in

And then that wonderful tree just rained down all manner of lovely
fruit Gifts came flying thick and fast till the air seemed full and
each one was greeted with a shout of glee as it was put into the
hands of its owner A shawl flew down on Mrs Peppers shoulders and
a workbasket tumbled on Pollys head and tops and balls and fishing
poles sent Joel and David into a corner with howls of delight

But the climax was reached when a large wax doll in a very gay pink silk
dress was put into Phronsies hands and Dr Fisher stooping down
read in loud tones FOR PHRONSIE FROM ONE WHO ENJOYED HER GINGERBREAD
BOY

After that nobody had anything to say Books jumped down unnoticed and
gay boxes of candy Only Polly peeped into one of her books and saw
in Jappys plain handI hope well both read this next summer And
turning over to the titlepage she saw A Complete Manual of Cookery

The best is to come said Mrs Henderson in her gentle way When there
was a lull in the gale she took Pollys hand and led her to a
little stand of flowers in the corner concealed by a sheetpinks and
geraniums heliotropes and roses blooming away and nodding their
pretty heads at the happy sightPolly had her flowers

Why didnt we know cried the children at last when everybody was
tying on their hoods and getting their hats to leave the festive scene
how could you keep it secret mammy

They all went to Mrs Hendersons said Mrs Pepper Jasper wrote me
and asked where to send em and Mrs Henderson was so kind as to say
that they might come there And we brought em over last evening when
you were all abed I couldnt have done it she said bowing to the
Parson and his wife if twasnt for their kindnessnever in all this
world

And Im sure said the minister looking around on the bright group
if we can help along a bit of happiness like this it is a blessed
thing

And here Joel had the last word You said twant goin to be Christmas
always mammy I say looking around on the overflow of treasures and
the happy facesitll be just forever




EDUCATION AHEAD


After that they couldnt thank Jasper enough They tried to lovingly
and an elaborate letter of thanks headed by Mrs Pepper was drawn up
and sent with a box of the results of Pollys diligent study of Jaspers
book Polly stripped off recklessly her choicest buds and blossoms from
the gay little stand of flowers in the corner that had already begun
to blossom and tucked them into every little nook in the box that could
possibly hold a posy But as for thanking him enough

We cant do it mammy said Polly looking around on all the happy
faces and then up at Cherry who was singing in the window and who
immediately swelled up his little throat and poured out such a merry
burst of song that she had to wait for him to finish No not if we
tried a thousand years

Im agoin said Joel who was busy as a bee with his new tools that
the tree had shaken down for him to make Jappy the splendidest box you
ever saw Polly I guess thatll thank him

Do cried Polly hed be so pleased Joey

And I said Phronsie over in the corner with her children Im goin
to see my poor sick man sometime Polly I am

Oh dear cried Polly whirling around and looking at her mother
in dismay Shell be goin tomorrow Oh no Phronsie you cant he
lives miles and miles awayoh ever so far

Does he live as far as the moon asked little Phronsie carefully
laying Seraphina down and looking up at Polly anxiously

Oh I dont know said Polly giving Cherry a piece of bread and
laughing to see how cunning he looked Oh no of course not but its
an awful long ways Phronsie

I dont care said Phronsie determinedly giving the new doll a
loving little pat Im goin sometime Polly to thank my poor sick
man yes I am

Youll see him next summer Phronsie sang Polly skipping around the
kitchen and Jappys sister Marian the lovely lady and all the boys
Wont that be nice and Polly stopped to pat the yellow head bending in
motherly attentions over her array of dolls

Yees said Phronsie slowly the whole of em Polly

Yes indeed said Polly gayly the whole of em Phronsie

Hooray shouted the two boys while Phronsie only gave a long sigh
and clasped her hands

Better not be looking for summer said Mrs Pepper until you do
your duty by the winter then you can enjoy it and she took a fresh
needleful of thread

Mamsies right said Ben smiling over at her And he threw down
his book and jumped for his cap Now for a good chop he cried and
snatching a kiss from Phronsie he rushed out of the door to his work
whistling as he went

Warnt Mr Henderson good ma asked Polly watching his retreating
figure to give Ben learning

Yes he was replied Mrs Pepper enthusiastically Weve got a
parson if anybody has in this world

And Bens learning said Polly swelling with pride as she sat down
by her mother and began to sew rapidly so that hell be a big man
right off Oh dear as a thought made her needle pause a minute in its
quick flying in and out

What is it Polly Mrs Pepper looked keenly at the troubled face and
downcast eyes

Why began Polly and then she finished very slowly I shant know
anything and Benll be ashamed of me

Yes you will cried Mrs Pepper energetically you keep on trying
and the Lordll send some way dont you go to bothering your head about
it now Pollyitll come when its time

Will it asked Polly doubtfully taking up her needle again

Yes indeed cried Mrs Pepper briskly come fly at your sewing
thats your learning now

So tis said Polly with a little laugh Now lets see whichll get
their seam done first mamsie

And now letters flew thick and fast from the city to the little brown
house and back again warming Jaspers heart and filling the tedious
months of that winter with more of jollity and fun than the lad ever
enjoyed before and never was fun and jollity more needed than now
for Mr King having nothing to do and each year finding himself less
inclined to exercise any thoughtful energy for others began to look at
life something in the light of a serious bore and accordingly made it
decidedly disagreeable for all around him and particularly for Jasper
who was his constant companion But the boy was looking forward to
summer and so held on bravely

I do verily believe Polly he wrote that Badgertownll see the
gayest times it ever knew Sister Marian wants to go so thats all
right Now hurrah for a good timeits surely coming

But alas for Jasper as spring advanced his father took a decided
aversion to Hingham Badgertown and all other places that could be
mentioned in that vicinity

Its a wretched climate he asserted over and over and the
foundation of all my ill feelings this winter was laid Im convinced
in Hingham last summer

No use to urge the contrary and all Jaspers pleadings were equally
vain At last sister Marian who was kindhearted to a fault sorry to
see her brothers dismay and disappointment said one day Why not have
one of the children come here I should like it very muchdo invite
Ben

I dont want Ben said Jasper gloomily I want Polly He added this
in much the same tone as Phronsies when she had rushed up to him the
day she was lost declaring I want Polly

Very well then said sister Marian laughing Im sure I didnt mean
to dictate which one let it be Polly then yes I should prefer Polly
myself I think as weve enough boys now smiling to think of her own
brood of wide awake youngsters

If you only will father Ill try to be ever so good said Jasper
turning suddenly to his father

Jasper needs some change said sister Marian kindly he really has
grown very pale and thin

Hey said Mr King sharply looking at him over his eyeglasses The
boys well enough well enough But he twisted uneasily in his chair
all the same At last he flung down his paper twitched his fingers
through his hair two or three times and then burst outWell why
dont you send for her Im sure I dont careIll write myself and I
had better do it now Tell Thomas to be ready to take it right down it
must get into this mail

When Mr King had made up his mind to do anything everybody else must
immediately give up their individual plans and stand out of the way for
him to execute his at just that particular moment Accordingly Thomas
was dragged from his work to post the letter while the old gentleman
occupied the time in pulling out his watch every third second until the
slightlyoutofbreath Thomas reported on his return that the letter
did get in Then Mr King settled down satisfied and everything went on
smoothly as before

But Polly didnt come A grateful appreciative letter expressed in
Mrs Peppers own stiff way plainly showed the determination of that
good woman not to accept what was such a favor to her child

In vain Mr King stormed and fretted and begged offering every
advantage possiblePolly should have the best foundation for a musical
education that the city could afford also lessons in the schoolroom
under the boys private tutorit was all of no avail In vain sister
Marian sent a gentle appeal fully showing her heart was in it nothing
broke down Mrs Peppers resolve until at last the old gentleman
wrote one day that Jasper being in such failing health really depended
on Polly to cheer him up That removed the last straw that made it
putting ones self under an obligation which to Mrs Peppers
independent soul had seemed insurmountable

And now it was decided that Polly was really to go and pretty soon all
Badgertown knew that Polly Pepper was going to the big city And there
wasnt a man woman or child but what greatly rejoiced that a sunny
time was coming to one of the chicks in the little brown house With
many warm words and some substantial gifts kind friends helped forward
the outing Only one person doubted that this delightful chance should
be grasped at onceand that one was Polly herself

I cant she said and stood quite pale and still when the Hendersons
advised her mothers approval and even Grandma Bascom said Go I
cant go and leave mammy to do all the work

But dont you see Polly said Mrs Henderson drawing her to her
side that you will help your mother twice as much as you possibly
could here by getting a good education Think what your music will be
only think Polly

Polly drew a long breath at this and turned away

Oh Polly cried Ben though his voice choked if you give this up
there neverll be another chance and the boy put his arm around her
and whispered something in her ear

I know said Polly quietlyand then she burst out oh but I cant
tisnt right

Polly said Mrs Pepperand never in all their lives had the children
seen such a look in mamsies eyes as met them then it does seem as
if my heart would be broken if you didnt go And then she burst out
crying right before them all

Oh mammy cried Polly breaking away from everybody and flinging
herself into her arms Ill goif you think I ought to But its too
good dont crydont mammy dear and Polly stroked the careworn face
lovingly and patted the smooth hair that was still so black

And Polly said Mrs Pepper smiling through her tears just think
what a comfort youll be to me and us all she added taking in the
children who were crowding around Polly as the centre of attraction
Why youll be the making of us she added hopefully

Ill do something said Polly her brown eyes kindling or I shant
be worthy of you mammy

O youll do it said Mrs Pepper confidently now that youre
going

But when Polly stepped into the stage with her little hair trunk
strapped on behind containing her one brown merino that Mrs Henderson
had made over for her out of one of her own and her two new ginghams
her courage failed again and she astonished everybody and nearly upset
a mildfaced old lady who was in the corner placidly eating doughnuts
by springing out and rushing up through the little brown gate past
all the family drawn up to see her off She flew over the old flat
doorstone and into the bedroom where she flung herself down between
the old bed and Phronsies crib in a sudden torrent of tears I cant
go she sobbedoh I cant

Why Polly cried Mrs Pepper hurrying in followed by Joel and the
rest of the troops at his heels What are you thinking of

Think of byandby Polly put in Ben patting her on the back with
an unsteady hand while Joel varied the proceedings by running back
and forth screaming at the top of his lungs The stages going your
trunkll be taken

Dear me ejaculated Mrs Pepper do stop it somebody there Polly
come now Do as mother says

Ill try again said poor Polly choking back her sobs and getting on
her feet

Then Pollys tears were wiped away her hat straightened after which
she was kissed all round again by the whole family Phronsie waiting
for the last two and then was helped again into the stage the bags and
parcels and a box for Jappy which as it wouldnt go into the trunk
Joel had insisted Polly should carry in her hand were again piled
around her and Mr Tisbett mounted to his seat and with a crack of the
whip bore her safely off this time

The doughnut lady viewing poor Polly with extreme sympathy immediately
forced upon her acceptance three of the largest and sugariest

Twill do you good she said falling to herself on another with
good zeal I always eat em and then there aint any room for
homesickness

And away and away and away they rumbled and jumbled to the cars

Here Mr Tisbett put Polly and her numerous bundles under the care of
the conductor with manifold charges and explicit directions to see her
safely into Mr Kings own hands He left her sitting straight up among
her parcels her sturdy little figure drawn up to its full height and
the clear brown eyes regaining a little of their dancing light for
although a dreadful feeling tugged at her heart as she thought of the
little brown house she was fast flying away from there was something
else our Polly had begun to realize that now she was going to help
mother

And now they neared the big city and everybody began to bustle around
and get ready to jump out and the minute the train stopped the crowd
poured out from the cars making way for the crowd pouring in for this
was a through train

All aboard sang the conductor Oh my senses springing to Polly I
forgot youhere

But as quick as a flash he was pushed aside and a bright boyish figure
dashed up

Oh Polly he said in such a ringing voice and in another second
Polly and her bag and the bundle of cakes and apples that Grandma
Bascom had put up for her and Joels box were one and all bundled
out upon the platform and the train whizzed on and there Mr King was
fuming up and down berating the departing conductor and speaking
his mind in regard to all the railroad officials he could think of He
pulled himself up long enough to give Polly a hearty welcome and then
away again he flew in righteous indignation while Jasper rushed off
into the baggage room with Pollys check

However every now and then turning to look down into the little rosy
face beside him the old gentleman would burst forth Bless me child
Im glad youre here Pollyhow could the fellow forget when

Oh well you know said Polly with a happy little wriggle under her
brown coat Im here now

So you are so you are laughed the old gentleman suddenly where can
Jasper be so long

Theyre all in the carriage answered the boy skipping back Now
father now Polly

He was fairly bubbling over with joy and Mr King forgot his dudgeon and
joined in the general glee which soon became so great that travellers
gave many a glance at the merry trio who bundled away to Thomas and the
waiting grays

Youre sure youve got the right check asked Mr King nervously
getting into a handsome coach lined with dark green satin and settling
down among its ample cushions with a sigh of relief

Oh yes laughed Jasper Polly didnt have any one elses check I
guess

Over through the heart of the city down narrow noisy business
streets out into wide avenues with handsome stately mansions on either
sidethey flew along

Oh said Polly and then she stopped and blushed very hard

What is it my dear asked Mr King kindly

Polly couldnt speak at first but when Jasper stopped his merry chat
and begged to know what it was she turned on him and burst out You
live here

Why yes laughed the boy why not

Oh said Polly again her cheeks as red as two roses its so
lovely

And then the carriage turned in at a brown stone gateway and winding
up among some fine old trees stopped before a large stately residence
that in Pollys eyes seemed like one of the castles of Bens famous
stories And then Mr King got out and gallantly escorted Polly out
and up the steps while Jasper followed with Pollys bag which he
couldnt be persuaded to resign to Thomas A stiff waiter held the door
openand then the rest was only a pleasant confused jumble of kind
welcoming words smiling faces with a background of high spacious
walls bright pictures and soft elegant hangings everything and all
inextricably mixedtill Polly herself seemed floatingawayaway fast
to the Fairyland of her dreams now Mr King was handing her around
like a precious parcel from one to the othernow Jasper was bobbing
in and out everywhere introducing her on all sides and then Prince
was jumping up and trying to lick her face every minutebut best of all
was when a lovely face looked down into hers and Jaspers sister bent
to kiss her

I am very glad to have you here little Polly The words were simple
but Polly lifting up her clear brown eyes looked straight into the
heart of the speaker and from that moment never ceased to love her

It was a good inspiraton thought Mrs Whitney to herself this
little girl is going to be a comfort I know And then she set herself
to conduct successfully her three boys into friendliness and good
fellowship with Polly for each of them was following his own sweet will
in the capacity of host and besides staring at her with all his might
was determined to do the whole of the entertaining a state of things
which might become unpleasant However Polly stood it like a veteran

This little girl must be very tired said Mrs Whitney at last with a
bright smile Besides I am going to have her to myself now

Oh no no cried little Dick in alarm why shes just come we want
to see her

For shame Dick said Percy the eldest a boy of ten years who took
every opportunity to reprove Dick in public shes come a great ways
so she ought to rest you know

You wanted her to come out to the greenhouse yourself you know you
did put in Van the next to Percy who never would be reproved or
patronized only she wouldnt go

Youll come down to dinner said Percy politely ignoring Van Then
you wont be tired perhaps

Oh Im not very tired now said Polly brightly with a merry little
laugh only Ive never been in the cars before and

Never been in the cars before exclaimed Van crowding up while Percy
made a big round O with his mouth and little Dicks eyes stretched to
their widest extent

No said Polly simply never in all my life

Come dear said sister Marian rising quickly and taking Pollys
hand while Jasper showing unmistakable symptoms of pitching into all
the three boys followed with the bag

Up the broad oak staircase they went Polly holding by Mrs Whitneys
soft hand as if for dear life and Jasper tripping up two steps at a
time in front of them They turned after reaching the top down a hall
soft to the foot and brightly lighted

Now Polly said sister Marian Im going to have you here right
next to my dressing room this is your nest little bird and I hope
youll be very happy in it

And here Mrs Whitney turned up the gas and then just because she
couldnt help it gathered Polly up in her arms without another word
Jasper set down the bag on a chair and came and stood by his sisters
side looking down at her as she stroked the brown wavy hair on her
bosom

Its so nice to have Polly here sister he said and he put his hand
on Mrs Whitneys neck and then with the other hand took hold of both
of Pollys chubby ones who looked up and smiled and in that smile the
little brown house seemed to hop right out and bring back in a flash
all the nice times those eight happy weeks had brought him

Oh twas so perfectly splendid sister Marian he cried flinging
himself down on the floor by her chair You dont know what good times
we haddoes she Polly and then he launched out into a perfect
shower of Dont you remember this or Oh Polly you surely havent
forgotten that Mrs Whitney good naturedly entering into it and
enjoying it all with them until warned by the lateness of the hour
she laughingly reminded Jasper of dinner and dismissed him to prepare
for it

When the three boys saw Polly coming in again they welcomed her with
a cordial shout for one and all after careful measurement of her
had succumbed entirely to Polly and each was unwilling that the others
should get ahead of him in her regard

This is your seat Polly said sister Marian touching the chair next
to her own

Thereupon a small fight ensued between the little Whitneys while Jasper
looked decidedly discomfited

Let Polly sit next to me said Van as if a seat next to him was of
all things most to be desired

Oh no I want her said little Dick

Pshaw Dick youre too young put in Percy Youd spill the bread
and butter all over her

I wouldnt either said little Dick indignantly and beginning to
crawl into his seat I dont spill bread and butter now Percy you
know

See here said Jasper decidedly shes coming up here by father
and me that is sister Marian he finished more politely if youre
willing

All this while Polly had stood quietly watching the group the big
handsome table the bright lights and the welltrained servants with
a curious feeling at her heartwhat were the littlebrownhousepeople
doing

Polly shall decide it said sister Marian laughing Now where
will you sit dear she added looking down on the little quiet figure
beside her

Oh by Jappy please said Polly quickly as if there could be no
doubt and kind Mr King she added smiling at him

Thats right thats right my dear cried the old gentleman pleased
beyond measure at her honest choice And he pulled out her chair and
waited upon her into it so handsomely that Polly was happy at once
while Jasper with a proud toss of his dark wavy hair marched up
delightedly and took the chair on her other side

And now in two or three minutes it seemed as if Polly had always been
there it was the most natural thing in the world that sister Marian
should smile down the table at the brightfaced narrator who answered
all their numerous questions and entertained them all with accounts of
Bens skill of Phronsies cunning ways of the boys who made fun for
all and above everything else of the dear mother whom they all longed
to help and of all the sayings and doings in the little brown house No
wonder that the little boys forgot to eat and for once never thought of
the attractions of the table And when as they left the table at last
little Dick rushed impulsively up to Polly and flinging himself into
her arms declared I love youand youre my sister Nothing more
was needed to make Polly feel at home

Yes said Mrs Whitney and nodded to herself in the saying it was a
good thing and a comfort I believe has come to this house this day




BRAVE WORK AND THE REWARD


And on the very first morrow came Pollys music teacher

The big drawingroom with its shaded light and draped furniture with
its thick soft carpet on which no footfall could be heard with all
its beauty and loveliness on every side was nothing to Pollys eyes
only the room that contained the piano

That was all she saw And when the teacher came he was simply the Fairy
an ugly little one it is true but still a most powerful being who
was to unlock its mysteries and conduct her into Fairyland itself He
was a homely little Frenchman with a long curved nose and an enormous
black moustache magnificently waxed who bowed elaborately and called
her Mademoiselle Peppaire but he had music in his soul and Polly
couldnt reverence him too much

And now the big piano gave out new sounds sounds that told of a strong
purpose and steady patience Every note was struck for mother and the
home brood Monsieur Tourtelotte after watching her keenly out of his
little black eyes would nod to himself like a mandarin and the nod
would be followed by showers of extra politeness as his appreciation of
her patient energy and attention

Every chance she could get Polly would steal away into the drawingroom
from Jappy and the three boys and all the attractions they could offer
and laboriously work away over and over at the tedious scales and
exercises that were to be steppingstones to so much that was glorious
beyond Never had she sat still for so long a time in her active little
life and now with her arms at just such an angle with the stiff
chubby fingers kept under training and restraintwell Polly realized
years after that only her love of the little brown house could ever
have kept her from flying up and spinning around in perfect despair

She likes it said Percy in absolute astonishment one day when
Polly had refused to go out driving with all the other children in the
park and had gone resolutely instead into the drawingroom and shut
the door She likes those hateful old exercises and she dont like
anything else

Much you know about it said Jappy shes perfectly aching to go now
Percy Whitney

Well why dont she then said Percy opening his eyes to their widest
extent

Cause said Jasper stopping on his way to the door to look him full
in the face shes commenced to learn to play and there wont anything
stop her

Im going to try said Percy gleefully I know lots of ways I can do
to try anyway

See here now said Jasper turning back you let her alone Do
you hear he added and there must have been something in his eye to
command attention for Percy instantly signified his intention not to
tease this young music student in the least

Come on then old fellow and Jasper swung his cap on his head
Thomas will be like forty bears if we keep him waiting much longer

And Polly kept at it steadily day after day getting through with the
lessons in the schoolroom as quickly as possible to rush to her music
until presently the little Frenchman waxed enthusiastic to that degree
that as day after day progressed and swelled into weeks and each
lesson came to an end he would skip away on the tips of his toes his
nose in the air and the waxed ends of his moustache fairly trembling
with delight Ah such patience as Mademoiselle Peppaire has I know
no other such little Americane

I think said Jasper one evening after dinner when all the children
were assembled as usual in their favorite place on the big rug in front
of the fire in the library Prince in the middle of the group his head
on his paws watching everything in infinite satisfaction that Pollys
getting on in music as I never saw anyone do and thats a fact

I mean to begin said Van ambitiously sitting up straight and
staring at the glowing coals I guess I will tomorrow which
announcement was received with a perfect shoutVans taste being
anything rather than of a musical nature

If you do said Jappy when the merriment had a little subsided I
shall go out of the house at every lesson there wont anyone stay in
it Van

I can bang all I want to then said Van noways disturbed by the
reflection and pulling one of Princes long ears you think youre so
big Jappy just because youre thirteen

Hes only three ahead of me Van bristled Percy who never could
forgive Jappy for being his uncle much less the still greater sin of
having been born three years earlier than himself

Threes just as bad as four said Van

Lets tell stories began Polly who never could remember such goings
on in the little brown house we must each tell one she added with
the greatest enthusiasm and see which will be the biggest and the
best

Oh no said Van who perfectly revelled in Pollys stories and who
now forgot his trials in the prospect of one You tell Pollyyou tell
alone

Yes do Polly said Jasper wed rather

So Polly launched out into one of her gayest and finest and soon
they were in such a peal of laughter and had reached such heights of
enjoyment that Mr King popped his head in at the door and then came
in and took a seat in a big rockingchair in the corner to hear the fun
go on

Oh dear said Van leaning back with a long sigh and wiping his
flushed face as Polly wound up with a triumphant flourish how ever do
you think of such things Polly Pepper

That isnt anything said Jappy bringing his handsome face out into
the strong light why its just nothing to what she has told time and
again in the little brown house in Badgertown and then he caught
sight of Pollys face which turned a little pale in the firelight as he
spoke and the brown eyes had such a pathetic droop in them that it went
to the boys very heart

Was Polly homesick and so soon




POLLY IS COMFORTED


Yes it must be confessed Polly was homesick All her imaginations of
her mothers hard work increased by her absence loomed up before her
till she was almost ready to fly home without a minutes warning At
night when no one knew it the tears would come racing over the poor
forlorn little face and would not be squeezed back It got to be
noticed finally and one and all redoubled their exertions to make
everything twice as pleasant as ever

The only place except in front of the grand piano where Polly
approached a state of comparative happiness was in the greenhouse

Here she would stay comforted and soothed among the lovely plants and
rich exotics rejoicing the heart of Old Turner the gardener who since
Pollys first rapturous entrance had taken her into his good graces for
all time

Every chance she could steal after practice hours were over and after
the clamorous demands of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied
was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers

But even with the music and flowers the dancing light in the eyes went
down a little and Polly growing more silent and pale moved around
with a little droop to the small figure that had only been wont to fly
through the wide halls and spacious rooms with gay and springing step

Polly dont like us at last said Van one day in despair Then
dear said Mrs Whitney you must be kinder to her than ever
think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among
friends

Id like it first rate to be away from Percy said Van reflectively
I wouldnt come back in three no six weeks

My son said his mamma just stop and think how badly you would feel
if you really couldnt see Percy

Well said Van and he showed signs of relenting a little at that
but Percy is perfectly awful mamma you dont know and he feels so
smart too he said vindictively

Well said Mrs Whitney softly lets think what we can do for
Polly it makes me feel very badly to see her sad little face

I dont know said Van running over in his mind all the possible ways
he could think of for entertaining anybody unless shed like my new
book of travelsor my velocipede he added

Im afraid those wouldnt quite answer the purpose said his mamma
smilingespecially the last yet we must think of something

But just here Mr King thought it about time to take matters into his
hands So with a great many chucklings and shruggings when no one was
by he had departed after breakfast one day simply saying he shouldnt
be back to lunch

Polly sat in the drawingroom near the edge of the twilight practicing
away bravely Somehow of all the days when the home feeling was the
strongest this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer If she
could only see Phronsie for just one moment I shall have to give up
she moaned I cant bear it and over went her head on the music rack

Where is she said a voice over in front of the piano in the
gathering duskunmistakably Mr Kings

Oh shes always at the piano said Van She must be there now
somewhere and then somebody laughed Then came in the loudest of
whispers from little Dick Oh Jappy whatll she say

Hush said one of the other boys do be still Dick

Polly sat up very straight and whisked off the tears quickly Up came
Mr King with an enormous bundle in his arms and he marched up to the
piano puffing with his exertions

Here Polly hold your arms he had only strength to gasp And then he
broke out into a loud burst of merriment in which all the troop joined
until the big room echoed with the sound

At this the bundle opened suddenly andout popped Phronsie

Here Im Im here Polly

But Polly couldnt speak and if Jasper hadnt caught her just in time
she would have tumbled over backward from the stool Phronsie and all

Arent you glad Ive come Polly asked Phronsie with her little face
close to Pollys own

That brought Polly to Oh Phronsie she cried and strained her to
her heart while the boys crowded around and plied her with sudden
questions

Now youll stay cried Van say Polly wont you

Werent you awfully surprised cried Percy say Polly awfully

Is her name Phronsie put in Dick unwilling to be left out and not
thinking of anything else to ask

Boys whispered their mother warningly she cant answer you just
look at her face

And to be sure our Pollys face was a study to behold All its old
sunniness was as nothing to the joy that now transfigured it

Oh she cried coming out of her rapture a little and springing over
to Mr King with Phronsie still in her arms Oh you are the dearest
and best Mr King I ever saw but how did you make mammy let her come

Isnt he splendid cried Jasper in intense pride swelling up Father
knew how to do it

But Pollys arms were around the old gentlemans neck so she didnt
hear There there he said soothingly patting her brown fuzzy head
Something was going down the old gentlemans neck that wet his collar
and made him whisper very tenderly in her ear dont give way now
Polly Phronsiell see you

I know gasped Polly controlling her sobs I wontonlyI cant
thank you

Phronsie said Jasper quickly what do you suppose Prince said the
other day

What asked Phronsie in intense interest slipping down out of Pollys
arms and crowding up close to Jaspers side What did he Jasper

Ohho how funny laughed Van while little Dick burst right out
Japser

Be still said Jappy warningly while Phronsie stood surveying them
all with grave eyes

Well I asked him Dont you want to see Phronsie Pepper Prince And
do you know he just stood right upon his hind legs Phronsie and said
Bark yes Bark Bark

Did he really Jasper cried Phronsie delighted beyond measure and
clasping her hands in rapture all alone by himself

Yes all alone by himself asserted Jasper vehemently and winking
furiously to the others to stop their laughing he did now truly
Phronsie

Then mustnt I go and see him now Jasper yes pretty soon now

So you must cried Jasper enchanted at his success in amusing and
Ill go with you

Oh no cried Phronsie shaking her yellow head Oh no Jasper I
must go by my very own self

There Jap youve caught it laughed Percy while the others screamed
at the sight of Jaspers face

Oh Phronsie cried Polly turning around at the last words how could
you

Dont mind it Polly whispered Jasper twasnt her fault

Phronsie said Mrs Whitney smilingly stooping over the child
would you like to see a little pussy I have for you

But the chubby face didnt look up brightly as usual and the next
moment without a bit of warning Phronsie sprang past them all even
Polly and flung herself into Mr Kings arms in a perfect torrent of
sobs Oh lets go back was all they heard

Dear me ejaculated the old gentleman in the utmost amazement and
such a time as Ive had to get her here too he added staring around
on the astonished group none of whom had a word to say

But Polly stood like a statue All Jaspers frantic efforts at comfort
utterly failed To think that Phronsie had left her for any oneeven
good Mr King The room seemed to buzz and everything to turn upside
downand just then she heard another cryOh I want Polly I do

With a bound Polly was at Mr Kings side with her face on his coat
close to the little tearstained one The fat little arms unclasped
their hold and transferred themselves willingly to Pollys neck and
Phronsie hugged up comfortingly to Pollys heart who poured into her
ear all the loving words she had so longed to say

Just then there was a great rush and a scuffling noise and something
rushed up to Phronsie Oh And then the next minute she had her arms
around Princes neck too who was jumping all over her and trying as
hard as he could to express his overwhelming delight

Shes the cunningest little thing I ever saw said Mrs Whitney
enthusiastically afterward aside to Mr King Such lovely yellow
hair and such exquisite brown eyesthe combination is very striking
How did her mother ever let her go she asked impulsively I didnt
believe you could persuade her father

I didnt have any fears if I worked it rightly said the old
gentleman complacently I wasnt coming without her Marian if it
could possibly be managed The truth is that Phronsie had been pining
for Polly to such an extent that there was no other way but for her
to have Polly and her mother was just on the point although it almost
killed her of sending for Pollyas if we should have let her go he
cried in high dudgeon just as if he owned the whole of the Peppers and
could dispose of them all to suit his fancy So you see I was just in
time in the very nick of time in fact

So her mother was willing asked his daughter curiously Oh she
couldnt help it cried Mr King beginning to walk up and down the
floor and beaming as he recalled his successful strategy there wasnt
the smallest use in thinking of anything else I told her twould just
stop Polly from ever being a musician if she broke off nowand so
twould you know yourself Marian for we should never get the child
here again if we let her go now and I talkedwell I had to talk
some but wellthe upshot is I did get her and I did bring herand
here she is And the old gentleman was so delighted with his success
that he had to burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter
that occupied quite a space of time At last he came out of them and
wiped his face vigorously

And to think how fond the little girl is of you father said Mrs
Whitney who hadnt yet gotten over her extreme surprise at the old
gentlemans complete subjection to the little Peppers he whom all
children had by instinct always approached so carefully and whom every
one found it necessary to conciliate

Well shes a nice child he said a very nice child and
straightening himself up to his fullest height and looking so very
handsome that his daughter could not conceal her admiration I shall
always take care of Phronsie Pepper Marian

So I hope said Mrs Whitney and father I do believe theyll repay
you for I do think theres good blood there these children have a look
about them that shows them worthy to be trusted

So they have so they have assented Mr King and then the
conversation dropped




PHRONSIE


Phronsie was toiling up and down the long oak staircase the next
morning slowly going from one step to the other drawing each little
fat foot into place laboriously but with a pleased expression on her
face that only gave some small idea of the rapture within Up and down
she had been going for a long time perfectly fascinated seeming to
care for nothing else in the world but to work her way up to the top of
the long flight only to turn and come down again She had been going
on so for some time till at last Polly who was afraid she would tire
herself all out sat down at the foot and begged and implored the little
girl who had nearly reached the top to stop and rest

Youll be tired to death Phronsie she said looking up at the small
figure on its toilsome journey Why you must have gone up a million
times Do sit down pet were all going out riding Phronsie this
afternoon and you cant go if youre all tired out

I wont be tired Polly said Phronsie turning around and looking at
her do let me go just once more

Well said Polly who never could refuse her anything just once
Phronsie and then you must stop

So Phronsie kept on her way rejoicing while Polly still sat on the
lowest stair and drummed impatiently on the stair above her waiting
for her to get through

Jappy came through the hall and found them thus Halloa Polly he
said stopping suddenly whats the matter

Oh Phronsies been going so said Polly looking up at the little
figure above them which had nearly reached the top in delight that I
cant stop her She has really Jappy almost all the morning you cant
think how crazy she is over it

Is that so said Jasper with a little laugh Hulloa Phronsie is
it nice and he tossed a kiss to the little girl and then sat down by
Polly

Oh said Phronsie turning to come down its the beyewtiflest place
I ever saw Jasper the very beyewtiflest

I wish she could have her picture painted whispered Jasper
enthusiastically Look at her now Polly quick

Yes said Polly isnt she sweet

Sweet said Jasper I should think she was

The sunlight through an oriel window fell on the childish face and
figure glinting the yellow hair and lighting up the radiant face that
yet had a tender loving glance for the two who waited for her below
One little foot was poised just in the act of stepping down to the next
lower stair and the fat hand grasped the polished railing expressive
of just enough caution to make it truly childish In after years Jasper
never thought of Phronsie without bringing up this picture on that April
morning when Polly and he sat at the foot of the stairs and looked up
and saw it

Wheres Jap called one of the boys and then there was a clatter out
into the hall

What are you doing and Van came to a full stop of amazement and
stared at them

Resting said Jappy concisely what do you want Van

I want you said Van we cant do anything without you Jappy you
know that

Very well said Jasper getting up Come on Polly we must go

And Phronsie said Van anxiously looking up to Phronsie who had
nearly reached them by this time we want her too

Of course said Polly running up and meeting her to give her a hug
I dont go unless she does

Where are we going Polly asked Phronsie looking back longingly to
her beloved stairs as she was borne off

To the greenhouse chick said Jasper to help Turner and itll be
good fun wont it Polly

What is a greenhouse asked the child wonderingly All green
Jasper

Oh dear me said Van doubling up do you suppose she thinks its
painted green

Its green inside Phronsie dear said Jasper kindly and thats
the best of all

When Phronsie was really let loose in the greenhouse she thought it
decidedly best of all and she went into nearly as much of a rapture as
Polly did on her first visit to it

In a few moments she was cooing and jumping among the plants while old
Turner staid and particular as he was laughed to see her go

Shes your sister Miss Mary aint she at last he asked as Phronsie
bent lovingly over a little pot of heath and just touched one little
leaf carefully with her finger

Yes said Polly but she dont look like me

She is like you said Turner respectfully if she dont look like
you and the flowers know it too he added and theyll love to see
her coming just as they do you

For Polly had won the old gardeners heart completely by her passionate
love for flowers and nearly every morning a little nosegay fresh and
beautiful came up to the house for Miss Mary

And now nobody liked to think of the time or to look back to it when
Phronsie hadnt been in the house When the little feet went pattering
through halls and over stairs it seemed to bring sunshine and happiness
into every ones heart just to hear the sounds Polly and the boys in
the schoolroom would look up from their books and nod away brightly to
each other and then fall to faster than ever on their lessons to get
through the quicker to be with her again

One thing Phronsie always insisted on and kept to it
pertinaciouslyand that was to go into the drawingroom with Polly
when she went to practice and there with one of her numerous family of
dolls to sit down quietly in some corner and wait till she got through

Day after day she did it until Polly who was worried to think how
tedious it must be for her would look around and say Oh childie do
run out and play

I want to stay Phronsie would beg in an injured tone please let me
Polly

So Polly would jump and give her a kiss and then delighted to know
that she was there would go at her practicing with twice the vigor and
enthusiasm

But Phronsies chief occupation at least when she wasnt with Polly
was the entertainment and amusement of Mr King And never was she very
long absent from his side which so pleased the old gentleman that
he could scarcely contain himself as with a gravity befitting the
importance of her office she would follow him around in a happy
contented way that took with him immensely And nowadays no one ever
saw the old gentleman going out of a morning when Jasper was busy with
his lessons without Phronsie by his side and many people turned to see
the portly figure with the handsome head bent to catch the prattle of
a little sunnyhaired child who trotted along clasping his hand
confidingly And nearly all of them stopped to gaze the second time
before they could convince themselves that it was really that queer
stiff old Mr King of whom they had heard so much

And now the accumulation of dolls in the house became something
alarming for Mr King observing Phronsies devotion to her family
thought there couldnt possibly be too many of them so he scarcely
ever went out without bringing home one at least to add to them until
Phronsie had such a remarkable collection as would have driven almost
any other child nearly crazy with delight She however regarded them
something in the light of a grave responsibility to be taken care of
tenderly to be watched over carefully as to just the right kind of
bringing up and to have small morals and manners taught in just the
right way

Phronsie was playing in the corner of Mrs Whitneys little boudoir
engaged in sending out invitations for an elaborate teaparty to be
given by one of the dolls when Polly rushed in with consternation in
her tones and dismay written all over her face

What is it dear asked Mrs Whitney looking up from her embroidery

Why said Polly how could I I dont seebut Ive forgotten to
write to mamsie today its Wednesday you know and theres Monsieur
coming And poor Polly looked out in despair to see the lively little
music teacher advancing towards the house at an alarming rate of speed

That is because you were helping Van so long last evening over his
lessons said Mrs Whitney I am so sorry

Oh no cried Polly honestly I had plenty of timebut I forgot
twas mamsies day What will she do

You will have to let it go now till the afternoon dear theres no
other way it can go in the early morning mail

Oh dear sighed Polly I suppose I must And she went down to meet
Monsieur with a very distressed little heart

Phronsie laid down the note of invitation she was scribbling and
stopped to think and a moment or two after at a summons from a caller
Mrs Whitney left the room

I know I ought to said Phronsie to herself and the dolls yes I
know I had mamsie will feel oh so bad when she dont get Pollys
letter and I know the way I do truly

She got up and went to the window where she thought a minute and then
coming back she took up her little stubby pencil and bending over a
small bit of paper she commenced to trace with laborious efforts and
much hard breathing some very queer hieroglyphics that to her seemed to
be admirable as at last she held them up with great satisfaction

Goodbye she said then getting up and bowing to the dolls who sat
among the interrupted invitations I wont be gone but a little bit of
one minute and she went out determinedly and shut the door

Nobody saw the little figure going down the carriage drive so of course
nobody could stop her When Phronsie got to the gateway she looked up
and down the street carefully either way

Yes she said at last it was down here Im very sure I went with
grandpa and immediately turned down the wrong way and went on and
on grasping carefully her small and by this time rather soiled bit of
paper

At last she reached the business streets and although she didnt come
to the Post Office she comforted herself by the thoughtit must be
coming soon I guess its round this corner

She kept turning corner after corner until at last a little anxious
feeling began to tug at her heart and she began to thinkI wish I
could see Polly And now she had all she could do to get out of
the way of the crowds of people who were pouring up and down the
thoroughfare Everybody jostled against her and gave her a push Oh
dear thought Phronsie theres such a many big people and then
there was no time for anything else but to stumble in and out to
keep from being crushed completely beneath their feet At last an old
huckster woman in passing along knocked off her bonnet with the end
of her big basket which flew around and struck Phronsies head Not
stopping to look into the piteous brown eyes she strode on without a
word Phronsie turned in perfect despair to go down a street that looked
as if there might be room enough for her in it Thoroughly frightened
she plunged over the crossing to reach it

Look out cried a ringing voice Stop

The little girlll be killed said others with bated breath as a
powerful pair of horses whose driver could not pull them up in time
dashed along just in front of her With one cry Phronsie sprang between
their feet and reached the opposite curbstone in safety

The plunge brought her up against a knot of gentlemen who were standing
talking on the corner

Whats this asked one whose back being next to the street hadnt
seen the commotion as the small object dashed into their midst and
fell up against him

Didnt you see that narrow escape asked a second whose face had
paled in witnessing it This little girl was nearly killed a moment
agocareless driving enough And he put out his hand to catch the
child

Bless me cried a third whirling around suddenly Bless me you
dont say so why With a small cry but gladsome and distinct in its
utterance Phronsie gave one lookOh grandpa was all she could say

Oh where Mr King couldnt possibly have uttered another word for
then his breath gave out entirely as he caught the small figure

I went to the Post Office said the child clinging to him in delight
her tangled hair waving over the little white face into which a faint
pink color was quickly coming back Only it wouldnt come and I walked
and walkedwhere is it grandpa And Phronsie gazed up anxiously into
the old gentlemans face

She went to the Post Office turning around on the others fiercely
as if they had contradicted himWhy my child what were you going to
do

Mamsies letter said Phronsie holding up for inspection the precious
bit which by this time was decidedly forlorn Polly couldnt write
and Mamsied feel so bad not to get oneshe would really said the
child shaking her head very soberly for Polly said so

And youve beenoh I cant think of it said Mr King tenderly
taking her up on his shoulder well we must get home now or I dont
know what Polly will do And without stopping to say a word to his
friends he hailed a passing carriage and putting Phronsie in he
commanded the driver to get them as quickly as possible to their
destination

In a few moments they were home Mr King pushed into the house with his
burden Dont anybody know he burst out puffing up the stairs and
scolding furiously at every step enough to take better care of this
child than to have such goings on

What is the matter father asked Mrs Whitney coming up the stairs
after him What has happened out of the way

Out of the way roared the old gentleman irascibly well if you
want Phronsie racing off to the Post Office by herself and nearly
getting killed poor child yes Marian I say nearly killed he
continued

What do you mean gasped Mrs Whitney

Why where have you been asked the old gentleman who wouldnt let
Phronsie get down out of his arms under any circumstances so there she
lay poking up her head like a little bird and trying to say she wasnt
in the least hurt wheres everybody been not to know shed gone he
exclaimed wheres Pollyand Jasperand all of em

Pollys taking her music lesson said Mrs Whitney Oh Phronsie
darling and she bent over the child in her fathers arms and nearly
smothered her with kisses

Twas a naughty horse said Phronsie sitting up straight and looking
at her or I should have found the Post Office and I lost off my
bonnet too she added for the first time realizing her loss putting
her hand to her head a bad old woman knocked it off with a basketand
now mamsie wont get her letter and she waved the bit which she still
grasped firmly between her thumb and finger sadly towards Mrs Whitney

Oh dear groaned that lady how could we talk before her But who
would have thought it Darling and she took the little girl from her
fathers arms who at last let her go dont think of your mammas
letter well tell her how it was and she sat down in the first chair
that she could reach while Phronsie put her tumbled little head down on
the kind shoulder and gave a weary little sigh

It was so long she said and my shoes hurt and she thrust out the
dusty little boots that spoke pathetically of the long and unaccustomed
tramp

Poor little lamb said Mr King getting down to unbutton them What
a shame he mumbled pulling off half of the buttons in his frantic
endeavors to get them off quickly

But Phronsie never heard the last of his observations for in a minute
she was fast asleep The tangled hair fell off from the tired little
face the breathing came peaceful and regular and with her little hand
fast clasped in Mrs Whitneys she slept on and on

Polly came flying upstairs two or three at a time and humming a scrap
of her last piece that she had just conquered

Phronsie she called with a merry little laugh where

Hush said Mr King warningly and then just because he couldnt
explain there without waking Phronsie up he took hold of Pollys two
shoulders and marched her into the next room where he carefully closed
the door and told her the whole thing using his own discretion about
the very narrow escape she had passed through He told enough however
for Polly to see what had been so near them and she stood there so
quietly alternately paling and flushing as he proceeded till at last
when he finished Mr King was frightened almost to death at the sight
of her face

Oh goodness me Polly he said striding up to her and then fumbling
around on the table to find a glass of water you are not going to
faint are you Phronsies all well now she isnt hurt in the least I
assure you I assure youwhere is a glass of water Marian ought to see
that theres some herethat stupid Jane and in utter bewilderment
he was fussing here and there knocking down so many things in general
that the noise soon brought Polly to with a little gasp

Oh dont mind me dear Mr KingImall well

So you are said the old gentleman setting up a toilet bottle that he
had knocked over so you are I didnt think youd go and tumble over
Polly I really didnt and he beamed admiringly down on her

And then Polly crept away to Mrs Whitneys side where she threw herself
down on the floor to watch the little sleeping figure Her hand was
gathered up into the kind one that held Phronsies and there they
watched and watched and waited

Oh dear said Phronsie suddenly turning over with a little sigh
and bobbing up her head to look at Polly Im so hungry I havent had
anything to eat in ever an ever so long Polly and she gazed at her
with a very injured countenance

So you must be said Mrs Whitney kissing the flushed little face
Polly must ring the bell for Jane to bring this little bird some
crumbs

Can I have a great many asked Phronsie lifting her eyes with the
dewy look of sleep still lingering in them as many as two birdies

Yes dear said Mrs Whitney laughing I think as many as three
little birdies could eat Phronsie

Oh said Phronsie and leaned back satisfied while Polly gave the
order which was presently followed by Jane with a wellfilled tray

Now said Jappy when he heard the account of the adventure I say
that letter ought to go to your mother Polly

Oh said Polly it would scare mamsie most to death Jappy

Dont tell her the whole said Jasper quickly I didnt mean
thatabout the horses and all thatbut only enough to let her see how
Phronsie tried to get it to her

And Im going to write to your brother Joel said Van drawing up to
the library table Ill scare him Polly I guess he wont tell your
mother

Your crowtracksll scare him enough without anything else said
Percy pleasantly who really could write very nicely while Polly broke
out in an agony

Oh no Van you mustnt you mustnt

If Van does said Jasper decidedly itll be the last time hell
write to the brown house I can tell him and besides hell go to
Coventry This had the desired effect

Lets all write said Polly

So a space on the table was cleared and the children gathered around
it when there was great scratching of pens and clearing of ideas
which presently resulted in a respectable budget of letters into which
Phronsies was lovingly tucked in the centre and then they all filed
out to put it into the letterbox in the hall for Thomas to mail with
the rest in the morning




GETTING READY FOR MAMSIE AND THE BOYS


And Ill tell you Marian what I am going to do

Mr Kings voice was pitched on a higher key than usual and extreme
determination was expressed in every line of his face He had met Mrs
Whitney at the foot of the staircase dressed for paying visits Oh
are you going out he said glancing impatiently at her attire And
Id just started to speak to you on a matter of great importance Of the
greatest importance indeed he repeated irritably as he stood with one
gloved hand resting on the balustrade

Oh its no matter father she replied pleasantly if its really
important I can postpone going for another day and

Really important repeated the old gentleman irascibly Havent I
just told you its of the greatest importance Theres no time to be
lost and with my state of health too its of the utmost consequence
that I shouldnt be troubled Its very bad for me I should think you
would realize that Marian

Ill tell Thomas to take the carriage directly back said Mrs Whitney
stepping to the door Or stay father Ill just run up and send the
children out for a little drive The horses ought to be used too you
know she said lightly preparing to run up to carry out the changed
plan

Never mind that now said Mr King abruptly I want you to give me
your attention directly And walking towards the library door getting
a fresh accession of impatience with every step he beckoned her to
follow

But his progress was somewhat impeded by little Dickor rather little
Dick and Prince who were standing at the top of the stairs to see Mrs
Whitney off When he saw his mother retrace her steps supposing her
yielding to the urgent entreaties that he was sending after her to stay
at home the child suddenly changed his Goodbyes to vociferous howls
of delight and speedily began to plunge down the stairs to welcome her

But the staircase was long and little Dick was in a hurry and besides
Prince was in the way The consequence was nobody knew just how that
a bumping noise struck into the conversation that made the two below in
the hall look up quickly to see the child and dog come rolling over the
stairs at a rapid rate

Zounds cried the old gentleman Here Thomas Thomas But as that
individual was waiting patiently outside the door on the carriage box
there was small hope of his being in time to catch the boy who was
already in his mothers arms not quite clear by the suddenness of the
whole thing as to how he came there

Oh oh Dickys hurt cried somebody up abovefollowed by every
one within hearing distance and all came rushing to the spot to ask a
thousand questions all in the same minute

There sat Mrs Whitney in one of the big carved chairs with little Dick
in her lap and Prince walking gravely around and around him with the
greatest expression of concern on his noble face Mr King was storming
up and down and calling on everybody to bring a bowl of water and
some brown paper and be quick interpolated with showers of blame on
Prince for sitting on the stairs and tripping people up while Dick
meanwhile was laughing and chatting and enjoying the distinction of
making so many people run and of otherwise being the object of so much
attention

I dont think he was sitting on the stairs father said Jasper who
when he saw that Dicky was really unhurt began to vindicate his dog
He never does that do you Sir he said patting the head that was
lifted up to him as if to be defended

And I expect we shall all be killed some day Jasper said Mr King
warming with his subject and forgetting all about the brown paper and
water which he had ordered and which was now waiting for him at his
elbow just by that creature

Hes the noblest began Jasper throwing his arms around his neck an
example which was immediately followed by the Whitney boys and the two
little Peppers When Dick saw this he began to struggle to get down to
add himself to the number

Wheres the brown paper began Mr King seeing this and whirling
around suddenly Hasnt any body brought it yet

Here tis sir said Jane handing him a generous supply Oh I dont
want to cried little Dick in dismay seeing his grandfather advance
with an enormous piece of paper which previously wet in the bowl of
water was now unpleasantly clammy and wetoh no I dont want to be
all stuck up with old horrid wet paper

Hush dear said his mamma soothingly Grandpapa wants to put it
onthere as Mr King dropped it scientifically on his head and then
proceeded to paste another one over his left eye

And I hope theyll all drop off cried Dick savagely shaking his
head to facilitate matters Yes I do every single one of em he
added with an expression that seen under the brown bits was anything
but benign

Was Prince on the stairs Dick asked Jasper coming up and peering
under his several adornments Tell us how you fell

No said little Dick crossly and giving his head another shake
He was up in the halloh dear I want to get down and he began to
stretch his legs and to struggle with so much energy that two or three
pieces fell off and landed on the floor to his intense delight

And how did you fall then said Jasper perseveringly Cant you
remember Dicky boy

I pushed Princey said Dick feeling with freedom from some of
his encumbrances more disposed for conversation and made him go
aheadand then I fell on top of himthats all

I guess Prince has saved him father cried Jasper turning around
with eyes full of pride and love on the dog who was trying as hard as
he could to tell all the children how much he enjoyed their caresses

And so it all came about that the consultation so summarily interrupted
was never held For as Mrs Whitney was about retiring that evening
Mr King rapped at her door on his way to bed

Oh he said popping in his head in response to her invitation to come
in its nothingonly I thought Id just tell you a word or two about
what Ive decided to do

Do you mean what you wanted to see me about this afternoon asked Mrs
Whitney who hadnt thought of it since Do come in father

Its no consequence said the old gentleman no consequence at all
he repeated waving his hand emphatically because Ive made up my mind
and arranged all my plansits only about the Peppers

The Peppers repeated Mrs Whitney

Yes Well the fact of it is Im going to have them here for a
visitthe whole of them you understand thats all there is to it
And I shall go down to see about all the arrangementsJasper and Iday
after tomorrow said the old gentleman as if he owned the whole
Pepper family inclusive and was the only responsible person to be
consulted about their movements

Will they come asked Mrs Whitney doubtfully

Come of course said Mr King sharply there isnt any other way
or else Mrs Pepper will be sending for her childrenand of course you
know Marian we couldnt allow thatwell thats all so good night
and the door closed on his retreating footsteps

And so Polly and Phronsie soon knew that mamsie and the boys were to
be invited And then the grand house big as it was didnt seem large
enough to contain them

I declare said Jasper next day when they had been laughing and
planning till they were all as merry as grigs if this old dungeon
dont begin to seem a little like the little brown house Polly

Twont answered Polly hopping around on one toe followed by
Phronsie till mamsie and the boys get here Jasper King

Well theyll be here soon said Jappy pleased at Pollys exultation
over it for were going tomorrow to do the inviting

And Pollys to write a note to slip into Marians said Mr King
putting his head in at the door And if you want your mother to come
child why youd better mention it as strong as you can

Im going to write said Phronsie pulling up after a prolonged skip
all out of breath Im going to write and beg mamsie dear Then shell
come I guess

I guess she will said Mr King looking at her You go on Phronsie
and write and that letter shall go straight in my coat pocket alone by
itself

Shall it asked Phronsie coming up to him and nobody will take it
out till you give it to mamsie

No nobody shall touch it said the old gentleman stooping to kiss
the upturned face till I put it into her own hand

Then said Phronsie in the greatest satisfaction Im going to write
this very one minute and she marched away to carry her resolve into
immediate execution

Before they got through they had quite a bundle of invitations and
pleadings for each of the three boys insisted on doing his part so
that when they were finally done up in an enormous envelope and put into
Mr Kings hands he told them with a laugh that there was no use for
Jappy and himself to go as those were strong enough to win almost
anybodys consent

However the next morning they set off happy in their hopes and
bearing the countless messages which the children would come up every
now and then to intrust to them declaring that they had forgotten to
put them in the letters

Youd had to have had an express wagon to carry the letters if you had
put them all in at last cried Jasper Youve given us a bushel of
things to remember

And oh dont forget to ask Ben to bring Cherry cried Polly the last
minute as they were driving off although she had put it in her letter at
least a dozen times and oh dear of course the flowers cant come

Weve got plenty here said Jasper You would not know what to do
with them Polly

Well I do wish mamsie would give some to kind Mrs Henderson then
said Polly on the steps clasping her hands anxiously while Jasper
told Thomas to wait till he heard the rest of the message and to
grandmayou know Grandma Bascom she was so good to us she said
impulsively And oh dont let her forget to carry some to dear dear
Dr Fisher and dont forget to give him our love Jappy dont forget
that and Polly ran down the steps to the carriage door where she
gazed up imploringly to the boys face

I guess I wont cried Jasper when I think how he saved your eyes
Polly Hes the best fellow I know he finished in an impulsive burst

And dont let mamsie forget to carry some in to good old Mr and Mrs
Beebe in townwhere Phronsie got her shoes you know that is if
mamsie can she added remembering how very busy her mother would be

Ill carry them myself said Jasper were going to stay over till
the next day you know

O cried Polly radiant as a rose will you really Jappy youre so
good

Yes I will said Jasper everything you want done Polly anything
else he asked quickly as Mr King impatient to be off showed
unmistakable symptoms of hurrying up Thomas

Oh no said Polly only do look at the little brown house Jasper
as much as you can and Polly left the rest unfinished Jasper seemed
to understand however for he smiled brightly as he said looking into
the brown eyes Ill do it all Polly every single thing And then
they were off

Mamsie and the boys could Polly ever wait till the next afternoon that
would bring the decision

Long before it was possibly time for the carriage to come back from the
depot Polly with Phronsie and the three boys who improving Jaspers
absence had waited upon her with the grace and persistence of cavaliers
of the olden time were drawn up at the old stone gateway

Oh dear said Van with an impatient fling they never will come

Wont they Polly asked Phronsie anxiously and standing quite
still

Dear me yes said Polly with a little laugh Van only means theyll
be a good while Phronsie Theyre sure to come some time

Oh said Phronsie quite relieved and she commenced her capering
again in extreme enjoyment

Im going said little Dick to run down and meet them Accordingly
off he went and was immediately followed by Percy who started with the
laudable desire of bringing him back but finding it so very enjoyable
he stayed himself and frolicked with Dick till the others hearing the
fun all took hold of hands and flew off to join them

Now said Polly when they recovered their breath a little lets all
turn our backs to the road and the minute we hear the carriage we must
whirl round and the one who sees em first can ask first Is mamsie
coming

All right cried the boys

Turn round Dick said Percy with a little shove for Dick was
staring with all his might right down the road And so they all flew
around till they looked like five statues set up to grace the sidewalk

Suppose a big dog should come suggested Van pleasantly and snap at
our backs

At this little Dick gave a small howl and turned around in a fright

There isnt any dog coming said Polly What does make you say such
awful things Van

I hear a noise said Phronsie and so they all whirled around in
expectation But it proved to be only a market wagon coming at a furious
pace down the road with somebodys belated dinner So they all had to
whirl back again as before The consequence was that when the carriage
did come nobody heard it

Jasper looking out was considerably astonished to see drawn up in
solemn array with their backs to the road five children who stood as
if completely petrified

What in the world he began and called to Thomas to stop whose
energetic Whoa reaching the ears of the frozen line caused it to
break ranks and spring into life at an alarming rate

Oh is she coming Jappy Is she Is she they all screamed together
swarming up to the carriage door and over the wheels

Yes said Jasper looking at Polly

At that Phronsie made a little cheese and sat right down on the
pavement in an ecstasy

Get in here all of you said Jasper merrily help Polly in first
For shame Dick dont scramble so

Dick always shoves said Percy escorting Polly up with quite an air

I dont either said Dick you pushed me awful just a little while
ago he added indignantly

Do say awfully corrected Van crowding up to get in You leave off
your lys so he finished critically

I dont know anything about any lees said little Dick who usually
so good natured was now thoroughly out of temper I want to get in
and go home and he showed evident symptoms of breaking into a perfect
roar

There said Polly lilting him up there he goes nowone two
three and little Dick was spun in so merrily that the tears changed
into a happy laugh

Now then bundle in all the rest of you put in Mr King who seemed
to be in the best of spirits Thats it go on Thomas

When are they coming Polly found time to ask in the general jumble

In three weeks from tomorrow said Jasper And everythings all
right Polly and the whole of them Cherry and all will be here then

Oh said Polly

Here we are cried Van jumping out almost before the carriage door
was open Mamma mamma he shouted to Mrs Whitney in the doorway
the Peppers are coming and the little brown house tooeverything and
everybody

They are said Percy as wild as his brother and everythings just
splendid Jappy said so

Everythings coming said little Dick tumbling up the stepsand the
birdandand

And mamsie finished Phronsie impatient to add her partwhile Polly
didnt say anythingonly looked

Three weeks I cant wait thought Polly at first in counting
over the many hours before the happy day would come But on Jaspers
suggesting that they should all do something to get ready for the
visitors and have a general trimming up with vines and flowers
besidethe time passed away much more rapidly than was feared

Polly chose a new and more difficult piece of music to learn to surprise
mamsie Phronsie had aspired to an elaborate pincushion that was
nearly done made of bits of worsted and canvas over whose surface
she had wandered according to her own sweet will in a way charming to
behold

I dont know what to do said Van in despair cause I dont know what
shed like

Cant you draw her a little picture asked Polly Shed like that

Does she like pictures asked Van with the greatest interest

Yes indeed said Polly I guess youd think so if you could see her

I know what I shall do with a dignified air said Percy who couldnt
draw and therefore looked down on all Vans attempts with the greatest
scorn And it wont be any old pictures either he added

What is it old fellow asked Jasper tell on now your grand plan

No Im not going to tell said Percy with the greatest secrecy
until the very day

What will you do sir asked Jasper pulling one of Dicks ears who
stood waiting to speak as if his mind was made up and wouldnt be
changed for anyone

I shall give Ben one of my kittiesthe littlest and the best he
said with heroic selfsacrifice

A perfect shout greeted this announcement

Fancy Ben going round with one of those awful little things whispered
Jappy to Polly who shook at the very thought

Dont laugh oh its dreadful to laugh at him Jappy she said when
she could get voice enough

No I shant tell said Percy when the fun had subsided who
finding that no one teased him to divulge his wonderful plan kept
trying to harrow up their feelings by parading it

You neednt then screamed Van who was nearly dying to know I dont
believe its so very dreadful much anyway

Whats yours Jappy asked Polly I know yours will be just
splendid

Oh no it isnt said Jasper smiling brightly but as I didnt know
what better I could do Im going to get a little stand and then beg
some flowers of Turner to fill it and

Why thats mine screamed Percy in the greatest disappointment
Thats just what I was going to do

Hoh hoh shouted Van I thought you wouldnt tell Mr Percy hoh
hoh

Hoh hoh echoed Dick

Hush said Jappy Why Percy I didnt know as you had thought of
that he said kindly Well then you do it and Ill take something
else I dont care as long as Mrs Pepper gets em

I didnt exactly mean that began Percy mine was roots and little
flowers growing

He means what he gets in the woods said Polly explaining dont
you Percy

Yes said the boy And then I was going to put stones and things in
among them to make them look pretty

And they will cried Jasper Go ahead Percy theyll look real
pretty and then Turner will give you some flowers for the stand I
know Ill ask him tomorrow

Will you cried Percy thatll be fine

Mine is the best said Van just at this juncture but it was said a
little anxiously as he saw how things were prospering with Percy for
my flowers in the picture will always be there and your old roots and
things will die

What will yours be then Jappy asked Polly very soberly The stand
of flowers would have been just lovely and you do fix them so nice
she added sorrowfully

Oh Ill find something else said Jappy cheerfully who had quite
set his heart on giving the flowers Let me seeI might carve her a
bracket

Do cried Polly clapping her hands enthusiastically And do carve a
little bird like the one you did on your fathers

I will said Jasper just exactly like it Now weve got something
to do before we welcome the little brown house peopleso lets fly
at it and the time wont seem so long

And at last the day came when they could all sayTomorrow theyll be
here

Well the vines were all up and pots of lovely climbing ferns and all
manner of pretty green things had been arranged and rearranged a dozen
times till everything was pronounced perfect and a big green Welcome
over the library door made of laurel leaves by the patient fingers
of all the children stared down into their admiring eyes as much as to
say Ill do my part

Oh dear said Phronsie when evening came and the children were as
usual assembled on the rug before the fire their tongues running wild
with anticipation and excitement I dont mean to go to bed at all
Polly I dont truly

Oh yes you do said Polly laughing then youll be all fresh and
rested to see mammy when she does come

Oh no said Phronsie shaking her head soberly and speaking in an
injured tone Im not one bit tired Polly not one bit

You neednt go yet Phronsie said Polly You can sit up half an hour
yet if you want to

But I dont want to go to bed at all said the child anxiously for
then I may be asleep when mamsie comes Polly

Shes afraid she wont wake up said Percy laughing Oh therell be
oceans of time before they come Phronsie

What is oceans asked Phronsie coming up and looking at him
doubtfully

He means mamsie wont get here till afternoon said Polly catching
her up and kissing her then I guess youll be awake Phronsie pet

So Phronsie allowed herself to be persuaded at the proper time to be
carried off and inducted into her little nightgown And when Polly went
up to bed she found the little pincushion with its hieroglyphics
that she had insisted on taking to bed with her still tightly grasped
in the little fat hand

Shell roll over and muss it thought Polly and then shell feel bad
in the morning I guess Id better lay it on the bureau

So she drew it carefully away without awaking the little sleeper and
placed it where she knew Phronsies eyes would rest on it the first
thing in the morning

It was going on towards the middle of the night when Phronsie whose
exciting dreams of mamsie and the boys wouldnt let her rest quietly
woke up and in the very first flash she thought of her cushion

Why where she said in the softest little tones only half awake
why Polly where is it and she began to feel all around her pillow
to see if it had fallen down there

But Pollys brown head with its crowd of anticipations and busy
plans was away off in dreamland and she breathed on and on perfectly
motionless

I guess I better said Phronsie to herself now thoroughly awake and
sitting up in bed not wake her up Poor Pollys tired I can find it
myself I know I can

So she slipped out of bed and prowling around on the floor felt all
about for the little cushion

Tisnt here oh no it isnt she sighed at last and getting up
she stood still a moment lost in thought Maybe Janes put it out
in the hall she said as a bright thought struck her I can get it
there and out she pattered over the soft carpet to the table at the
end of the long hall where Jane often placed the childrens playthings
over night As she was coming back after her fruitless search she
stopped to peep over the balustrade down the fascinating flight of
stairs now so long and dark Just then a little faint ray of light shot
up from below and met her eyes

Why she said in gentle surprise theyre all downstairs I guess
theyre making something for mamsieIm going to see

So carefully picking her way over the stairs with her little bare feet
and holding on to the balustrade at every step she went slowly down
guided by the light which as she neared the bottom of the flight she
saw came from the library door

Oh isnt it funny and she gave a little happy laugh They wont
know Im comin and now the soft little feet went pattering over the
thick carpet until she stood just within the door There she stopped
perfectly still

Two dark figures big and powerful were bending over something that
Phronsie couldnt see between the two big windows A lantern on the
floor flung its rays over them as they were busily occupied and the
firelight from the dying coals made the whole stand out distinctly to
the gaze of the motionless little figure

Why what are you doing with my grandpas things

The soft clear notes fell like a thunderbolt upon the men With a start
they brought themselves up and staredonly to see a little whiterobed
figure with its astonished eyes uplifted with childlike earnest gaze
as she waited for her answer

For an instant they were powerless to move and stood as if frozen to
the spot till Phronsie moving one step forward piped forth

Naughty men to touch my dear grandpas things

With a smothered cry one of them started forward with arm uplifted but
the other sprang like a cat and intercepted the blow

Stop was all he said A noise above the stairsa rushing sound
through the hall Something will save Phronsie for the household is
aroused The two men sprang through the window having no time to catch
the lantern or their tools as Polly followed by one and another
rushed in and surrounded the child

What gasped Polly and got no further

STOP THIEF roared Mr King hurrying over the stairs The children
frightened at the strange noises began to cry and scream as they
came running through the halls to the spot Jasper rushed for the
menservants

And there stood Phronsie surrounded by the pale group Twas two
naughty men she said lifting her little face with the grieved
astonished look still in the big brown eyes and they were touching my
grandpas things Polly

I should think they were said Jasper running over amongst the few
scattered tools and the lantern to the windows where on the floor
was a large table cover hastily caught up by the corners into which a
vast variety of silver jewelry and quantities of costly articles were
gathered ready for flight Theyve broken open your safe father he
cried in excitement see

And they put up their handone man did went on Phronsie And the
other said Stopoh Polly you hurt me she cried as Polly unable
to bear the strain any longer held her so tightly she could hardly
breathe

Go on said Jasper how did they look

All black said the child pushing back her wavy hair and looking at
him very all black Jasper

And their faces Phronsie said Mr King getting down on his old
knees on the floor beside her Bless me somebody else ask her I cant
talk

How did their faces look Phronsie dear asked Jasper taking one of
the cold hands in his Cant you think

Oh said Phronsieand then she gave a funny little laugh two big
holes Jasper thats all they had

She means they were masked whispered Jasper

What did you get up for Mrs Whitney asked Dear child what made
you get out of bed

Why my cushionpin said Phronsie looking worried at once I
couldnt find it and

But just at this without a bit of warning Polly tumbled over in a dead
faint

And then it was all confusion again

And so on the following afternoon it turned out that the Peppers
about whose coming there had been so many plans and expectations just
walked in as if they had always lived there The greater excitement
completely swallowed up the less




WHICH TREATS OF A GOOD MANY MATTERS


Phooh said Joel a few mornings after the emptying of the little brown
house into the big one when he and Van were rehearsing for the fiftieth
time all the points of the eventful night phooh if Id been here they
wouldnt have got away I guess

What would you have done asked Van bristling up at this reflection
on their courage and squaring up to him What would you have done
Joel Pepper

Id apitched right into emlikeeverything said Joel valiantly
and acaught em Yes every single one of the Bunglers

The what said Van bursting into a loud laugh

The Bunglers said Joel with a red face Thats what you said they
were anyway he added positively

I said Burglars said Van doubling up with amusement while Joel
stood a little sturdy figure regarding him with anything but a sweet
countenance

Well anyway Id acaught em so there he said as Van at last
showed signs of coming out of his fit of laughter and got up and wiped
his eyes

Howd you have caught em asked Van scornfully surveying the square
little country figure before him You cant hit any

Cant said Joel the black eyes flashing volumes and coming up in
front of Van You better believe I can Van Whitney

Come out in the back yard and try then said Van hospitably perfectly
delighted at the prospect and flying alone towards the door Come
right out and try

All right said Joel following sturdily equally delighted to show
his skill

There said Van taking off his jacket and flinging it on the grass
while Joel immediately followed suit with his little homespun one
Now we can begin perfectly splendid I wont hit hard he added
patronizingly as both boys stood ready

Hit as hard as youve amind to said Joel Im agoing to

Oh you may said Van politely because youre company All
rightnow

So at it they went Before very many minutes were over Van relinquished
all ideas of treating his company with extra consideration and was
only thinking how he could possibly hold his own with the valiant little
country lad Oh if he could only be called to his lessonsanything
that would summon him into the house Just then a window above their
heads was suddenly thrown up and his mammas voice in natural surprise
and distress called quickly Children what are you doing Oh Van how
could you

Both contestants turned around suddenly Joel looked up steadily Were
ahitting maam he said I couldnt and so we came out and

Oh Vanny said Mrs Whitney reproachfully to treat a little guest
in this way

I wanted to said Joel cheerfully twas great fun Lets begin again
Van

We mustnt said Van readily giving up the charming prospect and
beginning to edge quickly towards the house Mamma wouldnt like it you
know He hits splendidly mamma he added generously looking up He
does really

And so does Van cried Joel his face glowing at the praise Well
come out every day he added slipping into his jacket and turning
enthusiastically back to Van

And perhaps he could have pitched into the Burglars finished Van
ignoring the invitation and tumbling into his jacket with alarming
speed

I know I could cried Joel scampering after him into the house If
Id only abeen here

Wheres Ben said Van bounding into the hall and flinging himself
down on one of the chairs Oh dear Im so hot Say Joe where do you
spose Ben is

I dont know replied Joel who didnt even puff

I saw him a little while ago with master Percy said Jane who was
going through the hall

There now and theyve gone off somewhere cried Van in extreme
irritation and starting up quickly I know they have Which way did
they go Jane And how long ago

Oh I dont know replied Jane carelessly half an hour maybe and
they didnt go nowhere as I see at least they were talking at the door
and I was going upstairs

Right here cried Van and stamping with his foot to point out the
exact place at this door Jane

Yes yes said Jane at that very door and then she went into the
diningroom to her work

Oh dear me cried Van and flying out on the veranda he began to peer
wildly up and down the drive And theyve gone to some splendid
place I know and wouldnt tell us Thats just like Percy he added
vindictively hes always stealing away dont you see em Joel oh
do come out and look

Tisnt any use said Joel coolly sitting down on the chair Van had
just vacated and swinging his feet comfortably theyre miles away if
theyve been gone half an hour Im goin upstairs and he sprang up
and energetically pranced to the stairs

They arent upstairs screamed Van in scorn bounding into the hall
Dont go I know that theyve gone down to the museum

The what exclaimed Joel nearly at the top peering over the railing
Whats that you saidwhat is it

A museum shouted Van and its a perfectly elegant place Joel
Pepper and Percy knows I like to go and now hes taken Ben off
and hell show him all the things and theyll all be old when I take
himandandoh I hope the snakes will bite him he added trying to
think of something bad enough

Do they have snakes there asked Joel staring

Yes they do snapped out Van They have everything

Well they shant bite Ben cried Joel in terror Oh do you suppose
they will and he turned right straight around on the stairs and
looked at Van

No said Van they wont bitewhats the matter Joe

Oh they may said Joel his face working and screwing both fists
into his eyes at last he burst right out into a torrent of sobs Oh
dont let em Vandont

Why they cant said Van in an emphatic voice running up the stairs
to Joels side frightened to death at his tears

Then he began to shake his jacket sleeve violently to bring him back to
reason Wait Joe oh do stop oh dear what shall I do I tell you
they cant bite he screamed as loud as he could into his ear

You saidyouhopedtheywould said Joels voice in smothered
tones

Well they wont anyway said Van decidedly Cause theyre all
stuffedso there now

Aint they alivenor anythin asked Joel bringing one black eye
into sight from behind his chubby hands

No said Van theyre just as dead as anything Joel Pepperbeen
dead years and theres old crabs there too old dead crabsand theyre
just lovely Oh such a lots of eggs as theyve got And there are
shells and bugs and stonesand an awful old crocodile and Oh
dear sighed Joel perfectly overcome at such a vision and sitting
down on the stairs to think Well mamsiell know where Ben is he
said springing up And then I tell you Van well just tag em

So she will cried Van Why didnt we think of that before I wanted
to think

I did said Joel That was where I was goin

Without any more ado they rushed into Mrs Peppers big sunny room
there to see seated at the square table between the two large windows
the two lost ones bending over what seemed to be an object of the
greatest importance for Polly was hanging over Bens shoulder with
intense pride and delight which she couldnt possibly conceal and
Davie was crowded as near as he could get to Percys elbow

Phronsie and little Dick were perched comfortably on the corner of the
table surveying the whole scene in quiet rapture and Mrs Pepper with
her big mending basket was ensconced over by the deep window seat just
on the other side of the room underneath Cherrys cage and looking up
between quick energetic stitches over at the busy group with the most
placid expression on her face

Ohwhat you doin cried Joel flying up to them Let us see do
Ben

What is it exclaimed Van squeezing in between Percy and Ben

Dont began Percy There see youve knocked his elbow and spoilt
it

Oh no he hasnt said Ben putting down his pencil and taking up a
piece of rubber There see it all comes outas good as ever

Isnt it just elegant said Percy in the most pleased tone and
wriggling his toes under the table to express his satisfaction

Yes said Van craning his neck to get a better view of the picture
now nearly completed Its perfectly splendid Howd you do it Ben

I dont know replied Ben with a smile carefully shading in a few
last touches It just drew itself

Tisnt anything to what he can do said Polly standing up as tall as
she could and beaming at Ben He used to draw most beautiful at home

Better than this asked Van with great respect and taking up the
picture after some demur on Percys part and examining it critically
I dont believe it Polly

Phooh he did exclaimed Joel looking over his shoulder at a
wonderful view of a dog in an extremely excited state of mind running
down an interminable hill to bark at a locomotive and train of cars
whizzing along a curve in the foreground Lots bettern that Ben can
do anything he added in an utterly convincing way

Now give it back cried Percy holding out his hand in alarm Im
going to ask mamma to have it framed and then Im going to hang
it right over my bed he finished as Van reluctantly gave up the
treasure

Did you draw all the time in the little brown house asked Van lost
in thought How I wish Id been there

Dear no cried Polly with a little skip turning away to laugh He
didnt have hardly any time and

Why not asked Percy

Cause there was things to do said Polly But sometimes when it
rained and he couldnt go out and work and there wasnt anything to
do in the housethen wed haveoh and she drew a long breath at the
memory such a time you cant think

Didnt you wish it would always rain asked Van still gazing at the
picture

Dear no began Polly

I didnt broke in Joel in horror I wouldnt ahad it rain for
anythingonly once in a while he added as he thought of the good
times that Polly had spoken of

Twas nice outdoors said little Davie reflectively and nice
inside too And then he glanced over to his mother who gave him a
smile in return And twas nice always

Well said Van returning to the picture I do wish youd tell me how
to draw Ben I cant do anything but flowers he said in a discouraged
way

Flowers arent anything said Percy pleasantly Thats girls work
but dogs and horses and carsthose are just good

Will you Ben asked Van looking down into the big blue eyes so
kindly turned up to his

Yes indeed I will cried Ben that is all I know tisnt much but
everything I can Ill tell you

Then I can learn cant I cried Van joyfully

Oh tell me too Ben cried Percy will you I want to learn too

And me cried Dick bending forward nearly upsetting Phronsie as he
did so Yes say I may Ben do

Youre too little began Percy But Ben nodded his head at Dick
which caused him to clap his hands and return to his original position
satisfied

Well I guess were going to too said Joel Dave an me there
isnt anybody goin to learn without us

Of course not said Polly Ben wouldnt leave you out Joey

Phronsie sat quite still all this time on the corner of the table her
feet tucked up under her and her hands clasped in her lap and never
said a word But Ben looking up saw the most grieved expression
settling on her face as the large eyes were fixed in wonder on the
faces before her

And theres my pet he cried in enthusiasm and reaching over the
table he caught hold of one of the little fat hands Why we couldnt
think of getting along without her She shall learn to drawshe shall

Really Bensie said Phronsie the sunlight breaking all over the
gloomy little visage and setting the brown eyes to dancing Real
true splendid pictures

Yes the splendidest said Ben the very splendidest pictures
Phronsie Pepper you ever saw

Oh cried Phronsie and before any one knew what she was about
she tripped right into the middle of the table over the papers and
everything and gave a happy little whirl

Dear me Phronsie cried Polly catching her up and hugging her you
mustnt dance on the table

Im going to learn said Phronsie coming out of Pollys embrace to
draw whole pictures all alone by myselfBen said so

I know it said Polly and then you shall draw one for mamsieyou
shall

I will said Phronsie dreadfully excited Ill draw her a cow and
two chickens Polly just like Grandma Bascoms

Yes whispered Polly but dont you tell her yet till you get it
done Phronsie

I wont said Phronsie in the loudest of tonesbut putting her mouth
close to Pollys ear And then shell be so sprised Polly wont
she

Just then came Jaspers voice at the door Can I come in

Oh do Jappy cried Polly rushing along with Phronsie in her arms to
open the door Were so glad youve got home

So am I said Jasper coming in his face flushed and his eyes
sparkling I thought father never would be through downtown Polly

Were going to learn to draw said Percy over by the table who
wouldnt on any account leave his seat by Ben though he was awfully
tired of sitting still so long for fear somebody else would hop into
it Bens going to teach us

Yes he is put in Van bounding up to Jasper and pulling at all the
buttons on his jacket he could reach to command attention

And us said Joel coming up too You forgot us Van

The whole of usevery single one in this room said Van decidedly
all except Mrs Pepper

Hulloa said Jasper that is a class Well Professor Ben youve got
to teach me then for Im coming too

You said Ben turning around his chair and looking at him I cant
teach you anything Jappy You know everything already

Let him come anyway said Polly hopping up and down

Oh Im coming Professor laughed Jasper Never you fear Polly
Ill be on hand when the rest of the class comes in

And Van said Mrs Pepper pausing a minute in her work and smiling
over at him in a lull in the chatterI think flowers are most
beautiful and she pointed to a little framed picture on the mantel
of the bunch of buttercups and one huge rose that Van had with infinite
patience drawn and then colored to suit his fancy

Do you cried Van perfectly delighted and leaving the group he
rushed up to her side Do you really think theyre nice Mrs Pepper

Of course I do said Mrs Pepper briskly and beaming on him I think
everything of them and I shall keep them as long as I live Van

Well then said Van very much pleased I shall paint you ever so
many morejust as many as you want

Do said Mrs Pepper taking up her work again And Ill hang them
every one up

Yes I will said Van and Ill go right to work on one tomorrow
What you mending our jackets for he asked abruptly as a familiar hole
caught his attention

Because theyre torn said Mrs Pepper cheerfully an they wont
mend themselves

Why dont you let Jane he persisted She always does them

Janes got enough to do replied Mrs Pepper smiling away as hard
as she could and I havent so Im going to look around and pick up
something to keep my hands out of mischief as much as I can while Im
here

Do you ever get into mischief asked little Dick coming up and
looking into Mrs Peppers face wonderingly Why youre a big woman

Dear me yes said Mrs Pepper The bigger you are the more mischief
you can get into Youll find that out Dickey

And then do you have to stand in a corner asked Dick determined
to find out just what were the consequences and reverting to his most
dreaded punishment

No said Mrs Pepper laughing Corners are for little folks but
when people who know better do wrong there arent any corners they can
creep into or theyd get into them pretty quick

I wish said little Dick youd let me get into your lap That would
be a nice corner

Do mamsie said Polly coming up thats just the way I used to
feel and Ill finish the mending

So Mrs Pepper put down her work and moved the big basket for little
Dick to clamber up when he laid his head contentedly back in her
motherly arms with a sigh of happiness Phronsie regarded him with a
very grave expression At last she drew near Im tired do mamsie
take me

So mamsie will said Mrs Pepper opening her arms when Phronsie
immediately crawled up into their protecting shelter with a happy
little crow

Oh now tell us a story Mrs Pepper cried Van please please do

No no exclaimed Percy scuttling out of his chair and coming up
lets talk of the little brown house Do tell us what you used to do
therethats best

So tis cried Van ALL the nice times you used to have in it Wait
just a minute do And he ran back for a cricket which he placed
at Mrs Peppers feet and then sitting down on it he leaned on her
comfortable lap in order to hear better

Wait for me too till I get a chair called Percy starting Dont
begin till I get there

Here let me Percy said Ben and he drew forward a big easychair
that the boy was tugging at with all his might

Now Im ready too said Polly setting small finishing stitches
quickly with a merry little flourish and drawing her chair nearer her
mothers as she spoke

Now begin please said Van all the nice times you know

She couldnt tell all the nice times if she had ten years to tell them
in could she Polly said Jasper

Well in the first place then said Mrs Pepper clearing her throat
the little brown house had got to be you know so we made up our minds
to make it just the nicest brown house that ever was

And it was declared Jasper with an emphatic ring to his voice The
very nicest place in the whole world

Oh dear broke in Van enviously Jappys always said so I wish wed
been there too

We didnt want anybody but Jappy said Joel not very politely

Oh Joey for shame cried Polly

Jappy used to bake cried little Davie an we all made pies an
then we sat round an ate em an then told stories

Oh what fun cried Percy Do tell us

So the five little Peppers and Jasper flew off into reminiscences and
accounts of the funny doings and Mrs Pepper joined in heartily till
the room got very merry with the glee and enthusiasm called forth so
much so that nobody heard Mrs Whitney knock gently at the door and
nobody answering she was obliged to come in by herself

Well well she cried merrily looking at the swarm of little ones
around Mrs Pepper and the big chair You are having a nice time May I
come and listen

Oh if you will sister cried Jasper springing off from his arm of
the chair while Ben flew from the other side to hurry and get her a
chair

Percy and Van rushed too knocking over so many things that they didnt
help much and little Dick poked his head out from Mrs Peppers arms
when he saw his mamma sitting down to stay and began to scramble down to
get into her lap

There now said Mrs Whitney smiling over at Mrs Pepper who was
smiling at her You have your baby and I have mine Now children
whats it all about What has Mrs Pepper been telling you

Oh the little brown house cried Dicky his cheeks all aflame The
dearest little house mamma I wish I could live in one

Twouldnt be the same without the Peppers in it said Jasper Not a
bit of it

And they had such perfectly elegant times cried Percy enviously
drawing up to her side Oh you cant think mamma

Well now said his mamma do go on and let me hear some of the nice
times

So away they launched again and Mrs Whitney was soon enjoying it as
hugely as the children when a heavy step sounded in the middle of the
room and a voice spoke in such a tone that everybody skipped

Well I should like to know what all this means Ive been all over the
house and not a trace of anybody could I find

Oh father cried Mrs Whitney Van dear get up and get grandpapa a
chair

No no said the old gentleman waving him off impatiently Im not
going to stay I must go and lie down My head is in a bad condition
today very bad indeed he added

Oh said Phronsie popping up her head and looking at him I must get
right down

Whats the matter Phronsie asked Mrs Pepper trying to hold her
back

Oh but I must said Phronsie energetically wriggling My poor sick
man wants me he does And flying out of her mothers arms she ran up
to Mr King and standing on tiptoe said softly Ill rub your head
grandpa dear poor sick man yes I will

And youre the best child cried the old gentleman catching her
up and marching over to the other side of the room where there was a
lounging chair There now you and I Phronsie will stay by ourselves
Then my head will feel better

And he sat down and drew her into his arms

Does it ache very bad said Phronsie in a soft little voice Then
reaching up she began to pat and smooth it gently with one little hand
Very bad dear grandpa

It wont said the old gentleman if you only keep on taking care of
it little Phronsie

Then said the child perfectly delighted Im going to take all care
of you grandpa always

So you shall so you shall cried Mr King no less delighted than she
was Mrs Pepper

Sir said Mrs Pepper trying to answer which she couldnt do very
well surrounded as she was by the crowd of little chatterers Yes Sir
excuse me what is it sir

Weve got to come to an understanding about this thing said the old
gentleman and I cant talk much today because my headache wont
allow it

Here the worried look came into Phronsies face again and she began to
try to smooth his head with both little hands

And so I must say it all in as few words as possible he continued

What is it sir again asked Mrs Pepper wonderingly

Well the fact is Ive got to have somebody who will keep this house
Now Marian not a word as he saw symptoms of Mrs Whitneys joining
in the conversation Youve been good just as good as can be under the
circumstances but Mason will be home in the fall and then I suppose
youll have to go with him Now I said the old gentleman forgetting
all about his head and straightening himself up suddenly in the chair
am going to get things into shape so that the house will be kept for
all of us so that we can come or go And how can I do it better than to
have the Peppersyou Mrs Pepper and all your childrencome here and
live and

Oh father cried Jasper rushing up to him and flinging his arms
around his neck he gave him such a hug as he hadnt received for many a
day

Goodness Jasper cried his father feeling of his throat How can
you express your feelings so violently And besides you interrupt

Beg pardon sir said Jasper swallowing his excitement and trying to
control his eagerness

Do you say yes Mrs Pepper queried the old gentleman impatiently
I must get this thing fixed up today Im really too ill to be worried
maam

Why sir stammered Mrs Pepper I dont know what to say I couldnt
think of imposing all my children on you and

Imposing Whos talking of imposing said Mr King in a loud key
I want my house kept will you live here and keep it That is the
question

But sir began Mrs Pepper again you dont think

I do think I tell you maam I do think snapped the old gentleman
Its just because I have thought that Ive made up my mind Will you do
it Mrs Pepper

What are you goin to do mamsie asked Joel quickly

I dont know as Im going to do anything yet said poor Mrs Pepper
who was almost stunned

To come here and live cried Jasper unable to keep still any
longerand springing to the children Dont you want to Joe

To live screamed Joel Oh whickety yes Do ma do come here and
livedo

To live echoed Phronsie over in the old gentlemans lap In this
beyewtiful place Oh oh

Oh mamsie that was all Polly could say

And even Ben had his arms around his mothers neck whispering Do into
her ear while little Davie got into her lap and teased her with all his
might

What shall I do cried the poor woman Did ever anybody see the
like

Its the very best thing you could possibly do cried the old
gentleman Dont you see its for the childrens advantage Theyll get
such educations Mrs Pepper as you want for them And it accommodates
me immensely What obstacle can there be to it

If I was only sure twas best said Mrs Pepper doubtfully

Oh dear Mrs Pepper said Mrs Whitney laying her hand on hers Can
you doubt it

Then said Mr King getting up but still holding on to Phronsie
well consider it settled This is your home children he said
waving his hand at the five little Peppers in a bunch And having thus
summarily disposed of the whole business he marched out with Phronsie
on his shoulder




POLLYS DISMAL MORNING


Everything had gone wrong with Polly that day It began with her boots

Of all things in the world that tried Pollys patience most were the
troublesome little black buttons that originally adorned those useful
parts of her clothing and that were fondly supposed to be there when
needed But they never were The little black things seemed to be
invested with a special spite for one by one they would hop off on the
slightest provocation and go rolling over the floor just when she was
in her most terrible hurry compelling her to fly for needle and thread
on the instant For one thing Mrs Pepper was very strict aboutand
that was Polly should do nothing else till the buttons were all on
again and the boots buttoned up firm and snug

Oh dear said Polly sitting down on the floor and pulling on her
stockings There now see that hateful old shoe mamsie And she
thrust out one foot in dismay

Whats the matter with it said Mrs Pepper straightening the things
on the bureau You havent worn it out already Polly

Oh no said Polly with a little laugh I hope not yet but its
these dreadful hateful old buttons And she twitched the boot off from
her foot with such an impatient little pull that three or four more
went flying under the bed There nowtheres a lot more I dont care
I wish theyd all go they might as well she cried tossing that boot
on the floor in intense scorn while she investigated the state of the
other one

Are they all off asked Phronsie pulling herself up out of a little
heap in the middle of the bed and leaning over the side where she
viewed Polly sorrowfully Every one Polly

No said Polly but I wish they were mean old things when I was
going down to play a duet with Jasper We should have had a good long
time before breakfast Oh maynt I go just once mamsie Nobodyll
see me if I tuck my foot under the piano and I can sew em on
afterwardstherell be plenty of time Do just once mamsie

No said Mrs Pepper firmly there isnt any time but now And piano
playing isnt very nice when youve got to stick your toes under it to
keep your shoes on

Well then grumbled Polly hopping around in her stockingfeet where
is the workbasket mamsie Ohhere it is on the windowseat A rattle
of spools scissors and necessary utensils showed plainly that Polly had
found it followed by a jumble of words and despairing ejaculations as
she groped hurriedly under chairs and tables to collect the scattered
contents

When she got back with a very red face she found Phronsie who had
crawled out of bed sitting down on the floor in her little nightgown
and examining the boot with profound interest

I can sew em Polly she said holding up her hand for the big needle
that Polly was trying to threadI can now truly let me Polly do

Dear no said Polly with a little laugh beginning to be very much
ashamed What could you do with your little mites of hands pulling
this big thread through that old leather There scamper into bed again
youll catch cold out here

Tisnt very cold said Phronsie tucking up her toes under the
nightgown but Polly hurried her into bed where she curled herself
up under the clothes watching her make a big knot But the knot
didnt stay for when Polly drew up the long thread triumphantly to
the endout it flew and away the button hopped again as if glad to be
released And then the thread kinked horribly and got all twisted up in
disagreeable little snarls that took all Pollys patience to unravel

Its because youre in such a hurry said Mrs Pepper who was getting
Phronsies clothes And coming over across the room she got down on
one knee and looked over Pollys shoulder There now let mother see
whats the matter

Oh dear said Polly resigning the needle with a big sigh and leaning
back to take a good stretch followed by Phronsies sympathizing eyes
they neverll be on And there goes the first bell as the loud sounds
under Janes vigorous ringing pealed up over the stairs There wont
be time anyway now I wish there wasnt such a thing as shoes in the
world And she gave a flounce and sat up straight in front of her
mother

Polly said Mrs Pepper sternly deftly fastening the little buttons
tightly into place with quick firm stitches better be glad youve got
them to sew at all There now here they are Those wont come off in a
hurry

Oh mamsie cried Polly ignoring for a moment the delights of the
finished shoe to fling her arms around her mothers neck and give her a
good hug Youre just the splendidest goodest mamsie in all the world
And Im a hateful cross old bear so I am she cried remorsefully
buttoning herself into her boots Which done she flew at the rest of
her preparations and tried to make up for lost time

But twas all of no use The day seemed to be always just racing ahead
of her and turning a corner before she could catch up to it and Ben
and the other boys only caught dissolving views of her as she flitted
through halls or over stairs

Wheres Polly said Percy at last coming with great dissatisfaction
in his voice to the library door Weve called her I guess a million
times and she wont hurry

What do you want to have her do asked Jasper looking up from the
sofa where he had flung himself with a book

Why she said shed make Van and me our sails you know said Percy
holding up a rather forlorn looking specimen of a boat but which the
boys had carved with the greatest enthusiasm and we want her now

Cant you let her alone till shes ready to come said Jasper quickly
Youre always teasing her to do something he added

I didnt tease said Percy indignantly coming up to the sofa boat
in hand to enforce his words She said shed love to do em so there
Jasper King

Coming coming sang Polly over the stairs and bobbing into the
library Ohhere you are Percy I couldnt come before mamsie wanted
me Now says I for the sails And she began to flap out a long white
piece of cotton cloth on the table to trim into just the desired shape

That isnt the way said Percy crowding up the brightness that had
flashed over his face at Pollys appearance beginning to fade Hoh
those wont be good for anythingthose aint sails

I havent finished said Polly snipping away vigorously and longing
to get back to mamsie Wait till theyre done then theyll be goodas
good as can be

And its bad enough to have to make them put in Jasper flinging
aside his book and rolling over to watch them without having to be
found fault with every second Percy

Theyre too big said Percy surveying them critically and then
looking at his boat

Oh that corners coming off cried Polly cheerfully giving it a
sharp cut that sent it flying on the floor And they wont be too big
when theyre done Percy all hemmed and everything There as she held
one up for inspection thats just the way I used to make Bens and
mine when we sailed boats

Is it asked Percy looking with more respect at the piece of cloth
Polly was waving alluringly before him Just exactly like it Polly

Yes said Polly laying it down again for a patternoh how does
this goohthats it thereyes this is just exactly like Bensies
and minethat was when I was ever so little and then I used to make
Joels and Davies afterwards and

And were theirs just like this asked Percy laying his hand on the
sail she had finished cutting out

Precisely said Polly with a pin in her mouth Just as like as two
peas Percy Whitney

Then I like them cried Percy veering round and regarding them with
great satisfactionas Van bounded in with a torrent of complaints and
great disappointment in every line of his face

Oh now thats too bad he cried seeing Polly fold up the remaining
bits of cloth and pick up the scraps on the floor And youve gone
and let her cut out every one of em and never told me a word Youre a
mean old hateful thing Percy Whitney

Oh dont said Polly on her knees on the floor

I forgot began Percy and she cut em so quickand

And Ive been waiting said Van in a loud wrathful key and
waitingand waiting

Never mind Van said Jasper consolingly getting off from the sofa
and coming up to the table

Theyre done and done beautifully arent they he said holding up
one

But this only proved fresh fuel for the fire of Vans indignation

And you shant have em so he cried making a lunge at the one on
the table for I made most of the boat there

Oh no you didnt cried Percy in the greatest alarm hanging on to
the boat in his hand I cutall the keeland the bowand

Oh dear said Polly in extreme dismay looking at Jasper Come Ill
tell you what Ill do boys

What said Van cooling off a little and allowing Percy to edge into
a corner with the beloved boat and one sail What will you Polly

Ill make you another pair of sails said Polly groaning within
herself as she thought of the wasted minutes and then you can see me
cut em Van

Will you really he said delight coming all over his flushed face

Yes I will cried Polly wait a minute till I get some more cloth
And she started for the door

Oh now thats too bad said Jasper To have to cut more of those
tiresome old things Van let her off

Oh no I wont I wont he cried in the greatest alarm running up to
her as she stood by the door You did say so Polly You know you did

Of course I did Vanny said Polly smiling down into his eager face
and well have a splendid pair in justoneminute she sang

And so the sails were cut out and the hems turned down and basted and
tucked away into Pollys little workbasket ready for the sewing on the
morrow And then Mr King came in and took Jasper off with him and the
two Whitney boys went up to mamma for a story and Polly sat down in
mamsies room to tackle her French exercise




POLLYS BIG BUNDLE


The room was very quiet but presently Phronsie strayed in and seeing
Polly studying climbed up in a chair by the window to watch the birds
hop over the veranda and pick up worms in the grass beside the carriage
drive And then came Mrs Pepper with the big mending basket and
ensconced herself opposite by the table and nothing was to be heard but
the tick tick of the clock and an occasional dropping of a spool
of thread or scissors from the busy hands flying in and out among the
stockings

All of a sudden there was a great rustling in Cherrys cage that swung
in the big window on the other side of the room And then he set up a
loud and angry chirping flying up and down and opening his mouth as if
he wanted to express his mind but couldnt and otherwise acting in a
very strange and unaccountable manner

Dear me said Mrs Pepper whats that

Its Cherry said Polly lifting up her head from Fasquelle
andoh dear me and flinging down the pile of books in her lap on a
chair she rushed across the room and flew up to the cage and began to
wildly gesticulate and explain and shower down on him every endearing
name she could think of

What is the matter asked her mother turning around in her chair in
perfect astonishment What upon earth Polly

How could I cried Polly in accents of despair not heeding her
mothers question Oh mamsie will he die do you think

I guess not said Mrs Pepper laying down her work and coming up to
the cage while Phronsie scrambled off from her chair and hurried to the
scene Why he does act queer dont he Praps hes been eating too
much

Eating said Polly oh mamsie he hasnt had anything And she
pointed with shame and remorse to the seedcup with only a few dried
husks in the very bottom

Oh Polly began Mrs Pepper but seeing the look on her face she
changed her tone for one more cheerful Well hurry and get him some
now hell be all right poor little thing in a minute There there
she said nodding persuasively at the cage you pretty creature you so
you shant be starved

At the word starved Polly winced as though a pin had been pointed at
her

There isnt any mamsie in the house she stammered he had the last
yesterday

And you forgot him today asked Mrs Pepper with a look in her black
eyes Polly didnt like

Yesm said poor Polly in a low voice

Well he must have something right away said Mrs Pepper decidedly
Thats certain

Ill run right down to Fletchers and get it cried Polly

Twont take me but a minute mamsie Jaspers gone and Thomas too so
Ive got to go she added as she saw her mother hesitate

If you could wait till Ben gets home said Mrs Pepper slowly Im
most afraid it will rain Polly

Oh no mamsie cried Polly feeling as if she could fly to the ends
of the earth to atone and longing beside for the brisk walk down town
Going up to the window she pointed triumphantly to the little bit of
blue sky still visible There now see it cant rain yet awhile

Well said Mrs Pepper while Phronsie standing in a chair with her
face pressed close to the cage was telling Cherry through the bars not
to be hungry please dont which he didnt seem to mind in the least
but went on screaming harder than ever And besides tisnt much use
to wait for Ben Nobody knows where hell get shoes to fit himself and
Joe and Davie in one afternoon But be sure Polly to hurry for its
getting late and I shall be worried about you

Oh mamsie said Polly turning back just a minute I know the way to
Fletchers just as easy as anything I couldnt get lost

I know you do said Mrs Pepper but itll be dark early on account
of the shower Well she said pulling out her wellworn purse from her
pocket if it does sprinkle you get into a car Polly remember

Oh yes I will she cried taking the purse

And theres ten cents for your bird seed in that pocket said Mrs
Pepper pointing to a coin racing away into a corner by itself

Yesm said Polly wild to be off

And theres a fivecent piece in that one for you to ride up with
said her mother tying up the purse carefully Remember for you to
ride up with Well I guess you better ride up anyway Polly come to
think and then youll get home all the quicker

Where you going asked Phronsie who on seeing the purse knew there
was some expedition on foot and beginning to clamber down out of the
chair Oh I want to go too I do Take me Polly

Oh no Pet I cant cried Polly Ive got to hurry like
everything

I can hurry too cried Phronsie drawing her small figure to its
utmost height oh so fast Polly

And its ever so far cried Polly in despair as she saw the small
under lip of the child begin to quiver Oh dear me mamsie what shall
I do

Run right along said Mrs Pepper briskly Now Phronsie you and I
ought to take care of Cherry poor thing

At this Phronsie turned and wiped away two big tears while she gazed up
at the cage in extreme commiseration

I guess Ill give him a piece of bread said Mrs Pepper to herself
At this word bread Polly who was half way down the hall came
running back

Oh mamsie dont she said It made him sick before dont you know
it didso fat and stuffy

Well hurry along then said Mrs Pepper and Polly was off

Over the ground she sped only intent on reaching the bird store her
speed heightened by the dark and rolling bank of cloud that seemed to
shut right down suddenly over her and envelop her warningly

Its good Ive got the money to ride up with she thought to herself
hurrying along through the busy streets filled now with anxious crowds
homeward rushing to avoid the threatening shower Well here I am she
said with a sigh of relief as she at last reached Mr Fletchers big
bird store

Here she steadily resisted all temptations to stop and look at the new
arrivals of birds and to feed the carrierpigeons who seemed to be
expecting her and who turned their soft eyes up at her reproachfully
when she failed to pay her respects to them Even the cunning
blandishments of a very attractive monkey that always had entertained
the children on their numerous visits failed to interest her now
Mamsie would be worrying she knew and besides the sight of so many
birds eating their suppers out of generously full seedcups only filled
her heart with remorse as she thought of poor Cherry and his empty one

So she put down her ten cents silently on the counter and took up the
little package of seed and went out

But what a change The cloud that had seemed but a cloud when she went
in was now fast descending in big ominous sprinkles that told of a
heavy shower to follow Quick and fast they came making everybody fly
to the nearest shelter

I dont care said Polly to herself holding fast her little package
Ill run and get in the carthen Ill be all right

So she went on with nimble footsteps dodging the crowd and soon came
to the corner A car was just in sightthat was fine Polly put her
hand in her pocket for her purse to have it all readybut as quickly
drew it out again and stared wildly at the car which she allowed to
pass by Her pocket was empty

Oh dear she said to herself as a sudden gust of wind blew around
the corner and warned her to move on now what shall I do Well I
must hurry Nothing for it but to run now

And secretly glad at the chance for a good hearty run along the hard
pavements a thing she had been longing to do ever since she came to the
city Polly gathered her bundle of seed up under her arm and set out
for a jolly race She was enjoying it hugely whena sudden turn of the
corner brought her up against a gentleman who having his umbrella down
to protect his face hadnt seen her till it was too late

Polly never could tell how it was done but the first thing she knew she
was being helped up from the wet slippery pavement by a kind hand and
a gentlemans voice said in the deepest concern

I beg your pardon it was extremely careless in me

Its no matter said Polly hopping up with a little laugh and
straightening her hat Only and she began to look for her parcel
that had been sent spinning

What is it said the gentleman bending down and beginning to explore
too in the darkness

My bundle began Polly Oh dear

No need to ask for it now There lay the paper wet and torn down at
their feet The seed lay all over the pavement scattered far and wide
even out to the puddles in the street And not a cent of money to get
any more with The rain that was falling around them as they stood there
sent with the sound of every drop such a flood of misery into Pollys
heart

What was it child asked the gentleman peering sharply to find out
what the little shiny things were

Birdseed gasped Polly

Is that all said the gentleman with a happy laugh Im very glad

All Pollys heart stood still as she thought of Cherry stark and
stiff in the bottom of his cage if he didnt get it soon Now said
the kind tones briskly come little girl well make this all right
speedily Lets seeheres a bird store Now then

But sir began Polly holding back

Even Cherry had better die than to do anything her mother wouldnt like
But the gentleman already had her in the shop and was delighting the
heart of the shopkeeper by ordering him to do up a big package of all
kinds of seed And then he added a cunning arrangement for birds to
swing in and two or three other things that didnt have anything to do
with birds at all And then they came out on the wet slippery street
again

Now then little girl said the gentleman tucking the bundle under
his arm and opening the umbrella then he took hold of Pollys hand
who by this time was glad of a protector Where do you live For Im
going to take you safely home this time where umbrellas cant run into
you

Oh said Polly with a little skip Thank you sir Its up to Mr
Kings and

What said the gentleman stopping short in the midst of an immense
puddle and staring at her Mr Jasper Kings

I dont know sir said Polly what his other name is Yes it must be
Jasper thats what Jappys is anyway she added with a little laugh
wishing very much that she could see Jappy at that identical moment

Jappy said the stranger still standing as if petrified And are
there little Whitney children in the same house

Oh yes said Polly raising her clear brown eyes up at him The gas
lighter was just beginning his rounds and the light from a neighboring
lamp flashed full on Pollys face as she spoke showing just how clear
and brown the eyes were Theres Percy and Van and little Dickoh
hes so cunning she cried impulsively

The gentlemans face looked very queer just then but he merely said

Why you must be Polly

Yes sir I am said Polly pleased to think he knew her And then she
told him how shed forgotten Cherrys seed and all about it And
oh sir she said and her voice began to tremble Mamsiell be so
frightened if I dont get there soon

Im going up there myself so that it all happens very nicely said
the gentleman commencing to start off briskly and grasping her hand
tighter Now then Polly

So off they went at a very fast pace she skipping through the puddles
that his long even strides carried him safely over chattered away
by his side under the umbrella and answered his many questions and
altogether got so very well acquainted that by the time they turned in
at the old stone gateway she felt as if she had known him for years

And there the first thing they either of them saw down in a little
corner back of the tall evergreens was a small heap that rose as they
splashed up the carriagedrive and resolved itself into a very red
dress and a very white apron as it rushed impulsively up and flung
itself into Pollys wet arms

And I was so tired waiting Polly

Oh dear me Phronsie cried Polly huddling her up from the dark wet
ground Youll catch your death What will mamsie say

The stranger amazed at this new stage of the proceedings was vainly
trying to hold the umbrella over both till the procession could move on
again

Oh cried Phronsie shaking her yellow head decidedly theyre all
looking for you Polly She pointed one finger solemnly up to the big
carved door as she spoke At that Polly gathered her up close and began
to walk with rapid footsteps up the path

Do let me carry you little girl said Pollys kind friend
persuasively bending down to the little face on Pollys neck

Oh no no no said Phronsie at each syllable grasping Polly around
the throat in perfect terror and waving him off with a very crumpled
mangy bit of paper that had already done duty to wipe off the copious
tears during her anxious watch Dont let him Polly dont

There shant anything hurt you said Polly kissing her reassuringly
and stepping briskly off with her burden just as the door burst open
and Joel flew out on the veranda steps followed by the rest of the
troop in the greatest state of excitement

Oh whickety shes come he shouted springing up to her over the
puddles and crowding under the umbrella Whered you get Phronsie he
asked standing quite still at sight of the little feet tucked up to get
out of the rain And without waiting for an answer he turned and shot
back into the house proclaiming in stentorian tones Ma Pollys
comean shes got Phronsiean an awful big manand theyre out by
the gate

Phronsie said Mrs Pepper springing to her feet why I thought she
was upstairs with Jane

Now somebody exclaimed old Mr King who sat by the library table
vainly trying to read a newspaper which he now threw down in extreme
irritation as he rose quickly and went to the door to welcome the
wanderers somebody ought to watch that poor child whose business
it is to know where she is Shes caught her deathcold no doubt no
doubt

Outside in the rain the children revolved around and around Polly and
Phronsie hugging and kissing them until nobody could do much more than
breathe not seeming to notice the stranger who stood quietly waiting
till such time as he could be heard

At last in a lull in the scramble as they were dragging Polly and her
burden up the steps each wild for the honor of escorting her into the
house he cried out in laughing tones

Isnt anybody going to kiss me I wonder

The two little Whitneys who were eagerly clutching Pollys arms
turned around and Percy rubbed his eyes in a puzzled way as Joel said
stopping a minute to look up at the tall figure

We dont ever kiss strangersmamsies told us not to

For shame Joey cried Polly feeling her face grow dreadfully red in
the darkness the gentlemans been so kind to me

Youre right my boy said the stranger laughing and bending down
to Joels upturned sturdy countenance at the same instant that Mrs
Pepper flung open the big door and a bright warm light fell straight
across his handsome face And thenwell then Percy gave a violent
bound and upsetting Joel as he did so wriggled his way down the
stepsat the same time that Van on Pollys other side rushed up to
the gentleman

Papaoh papa

Polly half way up the steps turned around and then at the rush of
feeling that gathered at her heart sat right down on the wet slippery
step

Why Polly Pepper exclaimed Joel not minding his own upset Youre
right in all the slushmother wont like it I tell you

Hush cried Polly catching his arm hes comeoh Joelhes come

Who cried Joel staring around blindly who Polly Polly had just
opened her lips to explain when Mr Kings portly handsome figure
appeared in the doorway Do come in childrenwhygood gracious
Mason

Yes cried the stranger lightly dropping his big bundle and umbrella
as he passed in the door with his little sons clinging to him Where
is Marian

Why didnt you write asked the old gentleman testily These
surprises arent the right sort of things and he began to feel
vigorously of his heart Here Mrs Pepper be so good as to call Mrs
Whitney

Pepper Pepper repeated Mr Whitney perplexedly

Shes comingI hear her upstairs cried Van Whitney Oh let me
tell her He struggled to get down from his fathers arms as he said
this

No I shallI heard her first cried Percy Oh dear me Grandpapas
going to

Mr King advanced to the foot of the staircase as his daughter all
unconscious ran down with a light step and a smile on her face

Has Polly come she asked seeing only her father Yes replied the
old gentleman shortly and shes brought a big bundle Marian

A big bundle she repeated wonderingly and gazing at him

A very big bundle he said and taking hold of her shoulders he turned
her around onher husband

So Polly and Phronsie crept in unnoticed after all

I wish Ben was here said little Davie capering around the Whitney
group an Jappy I do

Where are they asked Polly

Dont know said Joel tugging at his shoestring Seearent these
prime He held up a shining black shoe fairly bristling with newness
for Polly to admire

Splendid she cried heartily but where are the boys

They went after you said Davie after we came home with our shoes

No they didnt contradicted Joel flatly and sitting down on the
floor he began to tie and untie his new possessions When we came home
Ben drew us pictureslots of emdont you know

Oh yes said Davie nodding his head so he did that was when we
all cried cause you werent home Polly

He drawed me a beyewtiful one cried Phronsie holding up her mangy
bit see Polly see

Thats the little brown house said Davie looking over her shoulder
as Phronsie put it carefully into Pollys hand

Its all washed out said Polly smoothing it out when you staid out
in the rain

Phronsies face grew very grave at that

Bad naughty old rain she said and then she began to cry as hard as
she could

Oh dear dont cried Polly in dismay trying her best to stop her
oh Phronsie do stop she implored pointing into the next room
whence the sound of happy voices issued theyll all hear you

But Phronsie in her grief didnt care but wailed on steadily

Who is it anyway cried Joel tired of admiring his precious shoes
and getting up to hear them squeak that great big man you know
Polly that came in with you

Why I thought I told you said Polly at her wits end over Phronsie
Its Percy and Vans father Joey

Whockey cried Joel completely stunned really and truly Polly
Pepper

Really and truly cried Polly bundling Phronsie up in her arms to lay
the little wet cheek against hers

Then Im going to peek cried Joel squeaking across the floor to
carry his threat into execution

Oh you mustnt Joe cried Polly frightened lest he should Come
right back or Ill tell mamsie

Theyre all comin in anyway cried little Davie delightedly and
scuttling over to Pollys side

And here are the little friends Ive heard so much about cried
Mr Whitney coming in amongst them Oh you neednt introduce me to
Pollyshe brought me home

Theyre all Pepperses said Percy waving his hand and doing the
business up at one stroke

Only the best of em isnt here observed Van rather ungallantly he
draws perfectly elegant papa

I like Polly best I do cried little Dick tumbling after Peppers
again repeated Mr Whitney in a puzzled way

And here is Mrs Pepper said old Mr King pompously drawing her
forward the childrens mother and

But here Mrs Pepper began to act in a very queer way rubbing her eyes
and twisting one corner of her black apron in a decidedly nervous manner
that as the old gentleman looked up he saw with astonishment presently
communicated itself to the gentleman opposite

Is it said Mr Whitney putting out his hand and grasping the hard
toilworn one in the folds of the apron is it cousin Mary

And arent you cousin John she asked the tears in her bright black
eyes

Of all things in this world cried the old gentleman waving his
head helplessly from one to the other Will somebody have the extreme
goodness to tell us what all this means

At this the little Peppers crowded around their mother and into all the
vacant places they could find to get near the fascinating scene

Well said Mr Whitney sitting down and drawing his wife to his side
its a long story You see when I was a little youngster and

You were John Whitney then put in Mrs Pepper slyly Thats the
reason I never knew when they were all talking of Mason Whitney

John Whitney I was said Mr Whitney laughing or rather Johnny and
Jack But Grandmother Mason when I grew older wanted me called by my
middle name to please grandfather But to go backwhen I was a little
shaver about as big as Percy here

Oh papa began Percy deprecatingly To be called a little shaver
before all the others

He means dearie said his mamma reassuringly when he was a boy
like you Now hear what papa is going to say

Well I was sent up into Vermont to stay at the old place There was a
little girl there a bright blackeyed little girl She was my cousin
and her name was Mary Bartlett

Whos Mary Bartlett asked Joel interrupting

There she is sir said Mr Whitney pointing to Mrs Pepper who was
laughing and crying together

Where said Joel utterly bewildered I dont see any Mary Bartlett
What does he mean Polly

I dont know said Polly Wait Joey she whispered hes going to
tell us all about it

Well this little cousin and I went to the district school and had
many good times together And then my parents sent for me and I went to
Germany to school and when I came back I lost sight of her All I could
find out was that she had married an Englishman by the name of Pepper

Oh cried all the children together

And I always supposed she had gone to England for despite all
my exertions I could find no trace of her Ah Mary he said
reproachfully why didnt you let me know where you were

I heard said Mrs Pepper that youd grown awfully rich and I
couldnt

You always were a proud little thing he said laughing Well but
broke in Mr King unable to keep silence any longer Id like to
inquire Mason why you didnt find all this out before in Marians
letters when she mentioned Mrs Pepper

She didnt ever mention her said Mr Whitney turning around to face
his questioner not as Mrs Peppernever once by name It was always
either Pollys mother or Phronsies mother Just like a woman he
added with a mischievous glance at his wife not to be explicit

And just like a man she retorted with a happy little laugh not to
ask for explanations

I hear Jappy cried Polly in a glad voice and Benoh good as
a sound of rushing footsteps was heard over the veranda steps and down
the long hall

The door was thrown suddenly open and Jasper plunged in his face
flushed with excitement and after him Ben looking a little as he did
when Phronsie was lost while Prince squeezed panting in between the two
boys

Has Polly got began Jasper

Oh yes Im here cried Polly springing up to them oh Ben

She has cried Joel disentangling himself from the group dont you
see Jappy

Shes all home echoed Phronsie flying up Oh Ben do draw me
another little house

And seesee cried the little Whitneys pointing with jubilant
fingers to their papa see what she brought

Jasper turned around at thatand then rushed forward

Oh brother Mason

Well Jasper said Mr Whitney a whole wealth of affection beaming on
the boy how you have stretched up in six months

Havent I said Jasper laughing and drawing himself up to his
fullest height

Hes astandin on tiptoe said Joel critically who was hovering
near I most know he is and he bent down to examine the position of
Jaspers heels

Not a bit of it Joe cried Jasper with a merry laugh and setting
both feet with a convincing thud on the floor

Well anyway Ill be just as big cried Joel when Im thirteen
so

Just then a loud and quick rap on the table made all the children skip
and stopped everybodys tongue It came from Mr King

Phronsie said he come here child I cant do anything without
you and held out his hand Phronsie immediately left Ben who was
hanging over Polly as if he never meant to let her go out of his sight
again and went directly over to the old gentlemans side

Now then He swung her upon his shoulder where she perched like a
little bird gravely surveying the whole group One little hand stole
around the old gentlemans neck and patted his cheek softly which so
pleased him that for a minute or two he stood perfectly still so that
everybody might see it

Now Phronsie you must tell all these children so that theyll
understandsay everything just as I tell you mind

I will said Phronsie shaking her small head wisely every single
thing

Well then now begin

Well then now begin said Phronsie looking down on the faces with
an air as much like Mr Kings as was possible and finishing up with
two or three little nods

Oh no dear that isnt it cried the old gentleman Ill tell you
Say Phronsie you are all cousinsevery one

You are all cousinsevery one repeated little Phronsie simply
shaking her yellow head into the very middle of the group

Does she mean it grandpapa Does she mean it cried Percy in the
greatest excitement

As true as everything demanded Joel crowding in between them

As true astruth said the old gentleman solemnly patting the
childs little fat hand So make the most of it

Oh said Polly with a long sigh And then Jasper and she took hold of
hands and had a good spin

Joel turned around with two big eyes on Percy

Were cousins he said

I know it said Percy and sos Van

Yes said Van flying up and Im cousin to Polly toothats best

Cant I be a Cousin cried little Dick crowding up with two red
cheeks Isnt anybody going to be a cousin to me too

Everybody but Jasper said the old gentleman laughing heartily at
them You and I my boy he turned to his son are left out in the
cold

At this a scream loud and terrible to hear struck upon them all as
Joel flung himself flat on the floor

Isnt Jappyourcousin IwantJappy

Goodness exclaimed the old gentleman in the greatest alarm what is
the matter with the boy Do somebody stop him

Joel said Jasper leaning over him and trying to help Polly lift him
up Ill tell you how well fix it Ill be your brother Thats best
of allbrother to Polly and Ben and the whole of youthen well see

Joel bolted up at that and began to smile through the tears running
down the rosy face

Will you really he said just like Benand everything

I cant be as good as Ben said Jappy laughing but Ill be a real
brother like him

Phoophoo Then I dont care cried Joel wiping off the last tear
on the back of his chubby hand Now I guess were bettern you he
exclaimed with a triumphant glance over at the little Whitneys as he
began to make the new shoes skip at a lively pace up and down the long
room

Oh dear they both cried in great distress

Now papa Jappys going to be Joeys brotherand he isnt anything
but our old uncle Make him be ours more papa do

And then Polly sprang up

Oh ohdeary me And she rushed out into the hall and began to
tug violently at the big bundle tossed down in a corner Cherryll
dieCherryll die she cried do somebody help me off with the
string

But Polly already had it off by the time Jaspers knife was half out
of his pocket and was kneeling down on the floor scooping out a big
handful of the seed

Dont hurry so Polly said Jasper as she jumped up to fly upstairs
Hes had some a perfect agehes all right

What said Polly stopping so suddenly that two or three little seeds
flew out of the outstretched hand and went dancing away to the foot of
the stairs by themselves

Oh I heard him scolding away there when I first came home said
Jasper so I just ran down a block or two and got him some

Is that all there is in that big bundle said Joel in a disappointed
tone who had followed with extreme curiosity to see its contents
Phoothats no funold birdseed

I know said Polly with a gay little laugh pointing with the handful
of seed into the library but I shouldnt have met the other big bundle
if it hadnt have been for this Joe

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff
