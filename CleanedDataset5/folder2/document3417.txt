CHAPTER I

THE OLD HOUSE IN KENNEDY SQUARE


Kennedy Square in the late fifties was a place of birds and trees and
flowers of rude stone benches sagging arbors smothered in vines and
cool dirtpaths bordered by sweetsmelling box Giant magnolias filled
the air with their fragrance and climbing roses played hide and seek
among the railings of the rotting fence Along the shaded walks
laughing boys and girls romped all day with hoop and ball attended by
old black mammies in white aprons and gayly colored bandannas while in
the more secluded corners sheltered by protecting shrubs happy lovers
sat and talked tired wayfarers rested with hats off and staid old
gentlemen read by the hour their noses in their books

Outside of all this color perfume and oldtime charm outside the
grassline and the rickety wooden fence that framed them in ran an
uneven pavement splashed with cool shadows and stained with green
mould Here in summer the watermelonman stopped his cart and here
in winter upon its broken bricks old Moses unhooked his bucket of
oysters and ceased for a moment his droning call

On the shady side of the square and halfhidden in ivy was a Noahs
Ark church topped by a quaint belfry holding a bell that had not rung
for years and faced by a clockdial all weatherstains and cracks
around which travelled a single rusty hand In its shadow to the right
lay the home of the Archdeacon a stately mansion with Corinthian
columns reaching to the roof and surrounded by a spacious garden filled
with damask roses and bushes of sweet syringa To the left crouched a
row of dingy houses built of brick their iron balconies hung in
flowering vines the windows glistening with panes of wavy glass
purpled by age

On the sunny side of the square opposite the church were more houses
high and low one all garden filled with brokennosed statues hiding
behind still more magnolias and another all veranda and honeysuckle
big rockingchairs and swinging hammocks and still others with
porticos curtained by white jasmine or Virginia creeper

Halfway down this stretch of sunshineand what a lovely stretch it
wasthere had stood for years a venerable mansion with high chimneys
sloping roof and quaint dormerwindows shaded by a tall sycamore that
spread its branches far across the street Two white marble steps
guarded by oldfashioned iron railings led up to the front door which
bore on its face a silverplated knocker inscribed in letters of black
with the name Of its ownerRichard Horn All three the door the
white marble steps and the silverplated knockernot to forget the
round silver knobs ornamenting the newel posts of the railingswere
kept as bright as the rest of the family plate by that most loyal of
servants old Malachi who daily soused the steps with soap and water
and then brought to a phenomenal polish the knocker bellpull and
knobs by means of fullersearth turpentine hard breathing and the
vigorous use of a buckskin rag

If this weazenedfaced baldheaded old darky resplendent in white
shirtsleeves green baize apron and neverceasing smile of welcome
happened to be engaged in this cleansing and polishing processand it
occurred every morningand saw any friend of his master approaching
he would begin removing his pail and brushes and throwing wide the
white door before the visitor reached the house would there await his
coming bent double in profound salutation Indeed whenever Malachi
had charge of the front steps he seldom stood upright so constantly
was he occupiedby reason of his masters large acquaintancein
either crooking his back in the beginning of a bow or straightening it
up in the ending of one

To one and all inquiries for Mr Horn his answer during the morning
hours was invariably the same

Yes sah Marse Richards in his lil room wrastlin wid his machine
I reckon Hes in dar now sah this with another low bow and then
slowly recovering his perpendicular with eyes fixed on the retreating
figure so as to be sure there was no further need of his services he
would resume his work drenching the steps again with soapsuds or
rubbing away on the doorplate or doorpull stopping every other
moment to blow his breath on the polished surface

When however someone asked for young Oliver the inventors only son
the reply was by no means so definite although the smile was a trifle
broader and the bow if anything a little more profound

Marse Oliver did you say sah Dats a difficult question sah Fo
Gawd I aint seen him since breakfas You might look into Jedge
Ellicotts office if you is gwine downtown whar dey do say hes
studyin law an if he aint daran I reckon he aintden you might
drap in on Mister Crocker whar Marse Olivers paintin dem pictures
an if he aint dar den fosho hes wid some o do young ladies but
which one de Lawd only knows Marse Olivers like the rabbit sahhe
dont leab no tracks and Malachi would hold his sides in a chuckle of
so suffocating a nature that it would have developed into apoplexy in a
less wrinkled and emaciated person

Inside of the front door of this venerable mansion ran a wide hall bare
of everything but a solid mahogany hatrack and table with glass mirror
and heavy haircloth settee over which suspended from the ceiling
hung a curious eightsided lantern its wick replaced with a modern
gasburner Above were the bedrooms reached by a curved staircase
guarded by spindling mahogany bannisters with slender handraila
staircase so pure in style and of so distinguished an air that only
maidens in gowns and slippers should have tripped down its steps and
only cavaliers in silk stockings and perukes have waited below for
their hands

Level with the bare hall opened two highly polished mahogany doors
which led respectively into the drawingroom and library their windows
draped in red damask and their walls covered with family portraits All
about these rooms stood sofas studded with brass nails big easychairs
upholstered in damask and small tables piled high with magazines and
papers Here and there between the windows towered a bookcase crammed
with wellbound volumes reaching clear to the ceiling In the centre of
each room was a broad mantel sheltering an open fireplace and on cold
daysand there were some pretty cold days about Kennedy Squaretwo
roaring woodfires dispensed comfort the welcoming blaze of each
reflected in the shining brass fireirons and fenders

Adjoining the library was the diningroom with its wellrubbed mahogany
table straightbacked chairs and old sideboard laden with family
silver besides a muchcoveted mahogany cellaret containing some of
that very rare Madeira for which the host was famous Here were more
easychairs and more portraitsone of Major Horn who fell at
Yorktown in cocked hat and epaulets and two others in mobcaps and
rufflesboth ancient grandmothers of long ago

The lil room ob Marse Richard to which in the morning Malachi
directed all his masters visitors was in an oldfashioned onestory
outhouse with a sloping roof that nestled under the shade of a big
tuliptree in the back yarda cool damp brickpaved old yard shut
in between high walls mantled with ivy and Virginia creeper and capped
by rows of broken bottles sunk in mortar This outbuilding had once
served as servants quarters and it still had the open fireplace and
broad hearth before which many a black mammy had toasted the toes of
her pickaninnies as well as the trapdoor in the ceiling leading to
the loft where they had slept Two windows which peered out from under
bushy eyebrows of tangled honeysuckle gave the only light a
greenpainted wooden door which swung level with the moist bricks the
only entrance

It was at this greenpainted wooden door that you would have had to
knock to find the man of all others about Kennedy Square most beloved
and the man of all others least understoodRichard Horn the
distinguished inventor

Perhaps at the first rap he would have been too absorbed to hear you
He would have been bending over his carpenterbenchhis deep
thoughtful eyes fixed on a drawing spread out before him the shavings
pushed back to give him room a pair of compasses held between his
fingers Or he might have been raking the coals of his forgeset up in
the same fireplace that had warmed the toes of the pickaninnies his
long red calico workinggown which clung about his spare body tucked
between his knees to keep it from the blaze Or he might have been
stirring a pot of gluea wooden model in his handor hammering away
on some bit of hot iron the brown paper cap that hid his sparse gray
locks pushed down over his broad forehead to protect it from the heat

When however his ear had caught the tap of your knuckles and he had
thrown wide the green door what a welcome would have awaited you How
warm the grasp of his fine old hand how cordial his greeting

Disturb me my dear sir he would have said in answer to your
apologies thats what I was put in the world for I love to be
disturbed Please do it every day Come in Come in Its delightful to
get hold of your hand

If you were his friend and most men who knew him were he would have
slipped his arm through your own and after a brief moment you would
have found yourself poring over a detailed plan his arm still in
yours while he showed you the outline of some pin or lever needed to
perfect the most marvellous of all discoveries of modern timeshis new
galvanic motor

If it were your first visit and he had touched in you some sympathetic
chord he would have uncovered a nondescript combination of glass jars
horseshoe magnets and copper wires which lay in a curious shaped box
beneath one of the windows and in a voice trembling with emotion as he
spoke he would have explained to you the value of this or that lever
and its necessary relation to this new invention of his which was so
soon to revolutionize the motive power of the world Or he would
perhaps have talked to you as he did to me of his theories and beliefs
and of what he felt sure the future would bring forth

The days of steampower are already numbered I may not live to see
it but you will This new force is almost within my grasp I know
people laugh but so they have always done All inventors who have
benefited mankind have first been received with ridicule I can expect
no better treatment But I have no fear of the result The steady
destruction of our forests and the eating up of our coalfields must
throw us back on chemistry for our working power There is only one
solution of this problemit lies in the employment of a force which
this machine will compel to our uses I have not perfected the
apparatus yet as you see but it is only a question of time
Tomorrow perhaps or next week or next yearbut it will surely
come See what Charles Bright and this Mr Cyrus Field are
accomplishing If it astonishes you to realize that we will soon talk
to each other across the ocean why should the supplanting of steam by
a new energy seem so extraordinary The problems which they have worked
out along the lines of electricity I am trying to work out along the
lines of galvanism Both will ultimately benefit the human race

And while he talked you would have listened with your eyes and ears
wide open and your heart too and believed every word he said no
matter how practical you might have been or how unwilling at first to
be convinced

On another day perhaps you might have chanced to knock at his door when
some serious complication had vexed hima day when the cogs and
pulleys upon which he had depended for certain demonstration had become
so tangled up in his busy brain that he had thoughts for nothing else
Then had he pushed pack his green door to receive you his greeting
might have been as cordial and his welcome as hearty but before long
you would have found his eyes gazing into vacancy or he would have
stopped halfway in an answer to your question his thoughts far away
Had you loved him you would then have closed the green door behind you
and left him alone Had you remained you would perhaps have seen him
spring from his seat and pick up from his workbench some unfinished
fragment This he would have plunged into the smouldering embers of his
forge and entirely forgetful of your presence would have seized the
handle of the bellows his eyes intent on the blaze his lips muttering
broken sentences At these moments as he would peer into the curling
smoke one thin hand upraised the long calico gown wrinkling about his
spare body the paper cap on his head he would have looked like some
alchemist of old or weird necromancer weaving a mystic spell
Sometimes as you watched his face with the glow of the coals lighting
up his earnest eyes there would have flashed across his troubled
features as heat lightning illumines a cloud some sudden brightness
from within followed by a quick smile of triumph The rebellious
fragment had been mastered For the hundredth time the great motor was
a success

And yet had this very pin or crank or cog on which he had set such
store refused the next hour or day or week to do its work no trace of
his disappointment would have been found in his face or speech His
faith was always supreme his belief in his ideals unshaken If the pin
or crank would not answer the lever or pulley would It was the
adjustment that was at fault not the principle And so the dear old
man would work on week after week only to abandon his results again
and with equal cheerfulness and enthusiasm to begin upon another
appliance totally unlike any other he had tried before It was only a
milestone he would say every one that I pass brings me so much
nearer the end

If you had been only a strangersome savant for instance who wanted
a problem in mechanics solved or a professor blinded by the dazzling
light of the almost daily discoveries of the time in search of mental
ammunition to fire back at curious students daily bombarding you with
puzzling questions or had you been a thrifty capitalist holding back
a first payment until an expert like Richard Horn had passed upon the
merits of some new laborsaving device of the day had you been any one
of these and you might very easily have been for such persons came
almost daily to see him the inventor would not only have listened to
your wants no matter how absorbed he might have been in his own work
but he would not have allowed you to leave him until he was sure that
your mind was at rest

Had you however been neither friend nor client but some unbeliever
fresh from the gossip of the Club where many of the habitues not only
laughed at the inventors predictions for the future but often lost
their tempers in discussing his revolutionary ideas or had you in a
spirit of temerity entered his room armed with arguments for his
overthrow nothing that your goodbreeding or the lack of it would have
permitted you to have said could have ruffled his gentle spirit With
the tact of a man of wide experience among men he would have turned
the talk into another channelmusic perhaps or some topic of the
dayand all with such exquisite grace that you would have forgotten
the subject you came to discuss until you found yourself outside the
yard and halfway across Kennedy Square before realizing that the
inventor had made no reply to your attacks

But whoever you might have been whether the friend of years the
anxious client or the trifling unbeliever and whatever the purpose of
your visit whether to shake his hand again for the very delight of
touching it to seek advice or to combat his theories you would have
carried away the impression of a man whose like you had never met
beforea man who spoke in a low gentle voice and yet with an
authority that compelled attention enthusiastic over the things he
loved silent over those that pained him a scholar of wide learning
yet skilled in the use of tools that obeyed him as readily as nimble
fingers do a hand a philosopher eminently sane on most of the accepted
theories of the day and yet equally insistent in his support of many of
the supposed sophistries and socalled fanaticisms of the hour an
oldtime aristocrat holding fast to the class distinctions of his
ancestors and yet glorying in the dignity of personal labor a patriot
loyal to the traditions of his State and yet so opposed to the bondage
of men and women that he had freed his own slaves the day his fathers
will was read a cavalier reverencing a woman as sweetheart wife and
mother and yet longing for the time to come when she too could make
a career then denied her coequal in its dignity with that of the man
beside her

A composite personality of strange contradictions of pronounced
accomplishments and yet of equally pronounced failures And yet
withal a man so gracious in speech so courtly in bearing so helpful
in counsel so rational human and lovable that agree with him or
not as you pleased his vision would have lingered with you for days

When night came the inventor would rake the coals from the forge and
laying aside his paper cap and calico gown close the green door of his
shop cross the brick pavement of the back yard and ascend the stairs
with the spindling bannisters to his dressing room Here Malachi would
have laid out the black swallowtail coat with the high velvet collar
trousers to match doublebreasted waistcoat with gilt buttons and
fluffy cravat of white silk

Then while his master was dressing the old servant would slip
downstairs and begin arranging the several rooms for the evenings
guestsfor there were always guests at night The red damask curtains
would be drawn close the hearth swept clean and fresh logs thrown on
the andirons The lamp in the library would be lighted and his
masters great easychair wheeled close to a low table piled high with
papers and magazines his bigeyed readingglasses within reach of his
hand The paper would be unfolded aired at the snapping blaze and
hung over the arm of the chair These duties attended to the old
servant with a last satisfied glance about the room would betake
himself to the foot of the staircase there to await his masters
coming glancing overhead at every sound and ready to conduct him to
his chair by the fire

When Richard his toilet completed appeared at the top of the stairs
Malachi would stand until his master had reached the bottom step wheel
about and with head up gravely and noiselessly precede him into the
drawingroomthe only time he ever dared to walk before himand with
a wave of the hand and the air of a prince presenting one of his
palaces would sayYo chars all ready Marse Richard bright fire
burnin Adding with a low sweeping bow now that the ceremony was
overHope yore feelin fine dis evenin sah

He had said it hundreds of times in the course of the year but always
with a salutation that was a special tribute and always with the same
low bow as he gravely pulled out the chair puffing up the back
cushion his wrinkled hands resting on it until Richard had taken his
seat Then with equal gravity he would hand his master the evening
paper and the bigbowed spectacles and would stand gravely by until
Richard had dismissed him with a gentle Thank you Malachi that will
do And Malachi with the serene uplifted face as of one who had
served in a temple would tiptoe out to his pantry

It had gone on for yearsthis waiting for Richard at the foot of the
staircase Malachi had never missed a night when his master was at
home It was not his dutynot a part of the established regime of the
old house No other family servant about Kennedy Square performed a
like service for master or mistress It was not even a custom of the
times

It was only one of Malachis ways Richard would say with a gentle
smile quivering about his lips

I do dat cause its Marse Richarddats all Malachi would answer
drawing himself up with the dignity of a chamberlain serving a king
when someone had the audacity to question hima liberty he always
resented

They had been boys togetherthese two They had fished and hunted and
robbed birds nests and gone swimming with each other They had fought
for each other and been whipped for each other many and many a time in
the old plantationdays Night after night in the years that followed
they had sat by each other when one or the other was ill

And now that each was an old man the mutual service was still continued

How are you getting on now Malachibetter Ah thats good and
the masters thin white hand would be laid on the black wrinkled head
with a soothing touch

Allus feels better Marse Richard when I kin git hold ob yo han
sah Malachi would answer

Not his slave remember Not so many pounds of human flesh and bone and
brains condemned to his service for life for Malachi was free to come
and go and had been so privileged since the day the old Horn estate had
been settled twenty years before when Richard had given him his
freedom with the other slaves that fell to his lot not that kind of a
servitor at all but his comrade his chum his friend the one man
black as he was in all the world who in laying down his life for him
would but have counted it as gain

Just before tea Mrs Horn with a thin gossamer shawl about her
shoulders would come down from her bedroom above and join her husband
Then young Oliver himself would come bounding in always a little late
but always with his face aglow and always bubbling over with laughter
until Malachi now that the last member of the family was at home
would throw open the mahogany doors and high tea would be served in
the diningroom on the wellrubbed unclothed mahogany table the
plates forks and saucers under Malachis manipulations touching the
polished wood as noiselessly as soapbubbles

Tea served and over Malachi would light the candies in the big
cutglass chandelier in the front parlorthe especial pride of the
hostess it having hung in her fathers house in Virginia

After this he would retire once more to his pantry this time to make
ready for some special function to follow for every evening at the
Horn mansion had its separate festivity On Mondays small whisttables
that unfolded or let down or evolved from halfmoons into circles
their tops covered with green cloth were pulled out or moved around so
as to form the centres of cosey groups Some extra sticks of hickory
would be brought in and piled on the andirons and the huge
librarytable always covered with the magazines of the dayLittells
Westminster Blackwoods and the Scientific Review would be pushed
back against the wall to make room

On Wednesdays there would be a dinner at six oclock served without
pretence or culinary assistance from the pastrycook outsideeven the
ices were prepared at home To these dinners any distinguished
strangers who were passing through the city were sure to be invited
Malachi in his time had served many famous menCharles Dickens Ole
Bull Macready and once the great Mr Thackeray himself with a second
glass of that pale sherry if you please and at the great mans
request too An appreciation which in the case of Mr Thackeray had
helped to mollify Malachis righteous wrath over the immortal
novelists ignorance of Southern dishes

Dat fat gemman wid de gold specs dat dey do say is so mighty great
aint eat nuffin yet but soup an a lil mite o tater he said to
Aunt Hannah on one of his trips to the kitchen as dinner went on He
let dat tarpin an dem ducks go by him same as dey was pizen But I
lay he knows bout dat ole yaller sherry and Malachi chuckled He
keeps a retchin fur dat decanter as if he was feared somebodyd git
it fust

On Fridays there would invariably be a musicalegenerally a quartette
with a few connoisseurs to listen and to criticise Then the piano
would be drawn out from its corner and the lid propped up so that Max
Unger of the Harmonie could find a place for his cello behind it
and there still be room for the inventor with his violina violin with
a tradition for Ole Bull had once played on it and in that same room
too and had said it had the soul of a Cremonawhich was quite true
when Richard Horn touched its strings

On all the other nights of the week Mrs Horn was at home to all who
came Some gentle old lady from across the Square perhaps in lace
caps and ribbons with a workbasket filled with fancy crewels and
whose big son came at nine oclock to take her home or Olivers young
friends boys and girls or old Doctor Wallace full of the days
gossip or Miss Lavinia Clendenning with news of the latest Assembly
or Nathan Gill with his flute

But then it was Nathan always whatever the occasion From the time
Malachi unlocked the front doors in the morning until he bolted them
for the night Nathan came and went The brick pavements were worn
smooth the neighbors said between the fluteplayers humble lodgings
in a side street and the Horn house so many trips a day did the old
man make People smiled at him as he hurried along his head bent
forward his long penwiper cloak reaching to his heels a widebrimmed
Quaker hat crowning his head

And always whenever the night or whatever the function or whoever the
guests a particular sidetable was sure to be moved in from Malachis
pantry and covered with a snowwhite cloth which played an important
part in the evenings entertainment This cloth was never empty Upon
its damask surface were laid a pile of Indiablue plates and a silver
basket of cake besides a collection of low glass tumblers with little
handles designed to hold various brews of Malachis own concoctions
which he alone of all the denizens of Kennedy Square could compound
and the secret of which unhappily has perished with him

And what wondrous aromas too

You may not believe it but I assure you on the honor of a Virginian
that for every one of these different nights in the old house on
Kennedy Square there were special savory odors emanating from these
brews which settled at once and beyond question the precise function
of the evening and all before you could hand your hat to Malachi If
for instance as the front door was opened the aroma was one of hot
coffee and the dry smell of fresh waferbiscuit mingled with those of a
certain brand of sherry then it was always to be plain whist in the
parlor with perhaps only Colonel Clayton and Miss Clendenning or some
one of the old ladies of the neighborhood to hold hands in a rubber
If the fumes of appletoddy mingled with the fragrance of toasted
apples were wafted your way you might be sure that Max Unger and
perhaps Bobbinette second violin and Nathanwhatever the function it
was always Nathan it must be rememberedand a few kindred spirits who
loved good music were expected and at the appointed hour Malachi his
hands encased in white cotton gloves would enter with a flourish and
would graciously beg leave to pass the huge bowl held high above his
head filled to the brim with smoking appletoddy the little pippins
browned to a turn floating on its top

If the occasion was one of great distinction one that fell on
Christmas or on New Years or which celebrated some important family
gathering the pungent odor of eggnog would have greeted you even
before you could have slipped off your gumshoes in the hall or hung
your coat on the mahogany rack This seductive concoctionthe most
potent of all Malachis beverageswas always served from a green and
gold Chinese bowl and drunk not from the customary low tumblers but
from special Spode cups and was I must confess productive of a
headfor I myself was once tempted to drink a bumper of it at this
most delightful of houses with young Oliver many years ago it is
true but I have never forgotten itproductive of an ACHING head I
think I said that felt as big in the morning as the Canton bowl in
which the mixture had been brewed

Or if none of these functions or festivals were taking place and only
one or two old cronies had dropped in on their way from the Club and
had drawn up their chairs close to the diningroom table and you had
happened to be hanging up your hat in the hall at that moment you
would have been conscious of an aroma as delicate in flavor as that
wafted across summer seas from faroff tropic isles of pomegranates
if you will ripening by crumbling walls of purple grapes drinking in
the sun of pine and hemlock of sweet spices and the scent of roses
or any other combination of delightful things which your excited
imagination might suggest

You would have known then just what had taken place how when the
gentlemen were seated Malachi in his undress blue coat and brass
buttons had approached his master noiselessly from behind and with a
gravity that befitted the occasion had bent low his head his hands
behind his back his head turned on one side and in a hushed voice had
asked this most portentous question

Which Madeira Marse Richard

The only answer would have been a lifting of the eyebrow and an
imperceptible nod of his masters head in the direction of the mahogany
cellaret

Malachi understood

It was the Tiernan of 29

And that worthy Keeper of the Privy Seal and Key pausing for an
instant with his brown jug of a head bent before the cellaret as a
Mohammedan bends his head before a wall facing Mecca had thereupon
unlocked its secret chambers and had produced a low deeply cut
decanter topped by a wondrous glass stopper This he had placed with
conscious importance on a small table before the two or three devotees
gathered together in its honor and the host removing the stopper had
filled the slender glasses with a vintage that had twice rounded the
Capea wine of such rare lineage and flavor that those who had the
honor of its acquaintance always spoke of it as one of the most
precious possessions of the towna wine too of so delicate an aroma
that those within the charmed circle invariably lifted the thin glasses
and dreamily inhaled its perfume before they granted their palates a
drop

Ah those marvellous unforgettable aromas that come to me out of the
long ago with all the reminders they bring of clink of glass and touch
of elbow of happy boys and girls and sweet old faces It is forty
years since they greeted my nostrils in the cool bare uncurtained
hall of the old house in Kennedy Square but they are still fresh in my
memory Sometimes it is the fragrance of newly made gingerbread or the
scent of creamy custard with just a suspicion of peachkernels
sometimes it is the scent of fresh strawberriesstrawberries that
meant the spring not the hothouse or Bermudaand sometimes it is the
smell of roasted oysters or succulent canvasbacks Forty years
agoand yet even today the perfume of a roasted apple never greets me
but I stand once more in the oldfashioned room listening to the sound
of Nathans flute I see again the stately silverhaired highbred
mistress of the mansion with her kindly greeting as she moves among
her guests I catch the figure of that old darkey with his brown bald
head and the little tufts of gray wool fringing its sides as he
shuffles along in his blue coat and baggy white waistcoat and
muchtoobig gloves and I hear the very tones of his voice as he
pushes his seductive tray before me and whispers confidentially

Take a lil ob de apple sah dats whar de real spression oh de
toddy is




CHAPTER II

STRAINS FROM NATHANS FLUTE


It was one of those Friday evenings then when the smell of roast
apples steeping in hot toddy came wafting out the portals of Malachis
pantrya smell of such convincing pungency that even the most
infrequent of frequenters having once inhaled it would have known at
the first whiff that some musical function was in order The night was
to be one of unusual interest

Nathan Gill and Max linger were expected and Miss Lavinia Clendenning
completing with Richard a quartette for cello flute piano and
violin for which Unger had arranged Beethovens Overture to Fidelio

Nathan of course arrived first On ordinary occasions another of
those quaint ceremonies for which the house was famous would always
take place when the old fluteplayer entered the drawingrooma
ceremony which brought a smile to the lips of those who had watched it
for years and which to this day brings one to those who recall it
Nathan with a look of quizzical anxiety on his pinched face would
tiptoe cautiously into the room peering about to make sure of
Richards presence his thin almost transparent fingers outspread
before him to show Richard that they were empty Richard would step
forward and with a tone of assumed solicitude in his voice would say

Dont tell me Nathan that you have forgotten your flute and
Nathan pausing for a moment would suddenly break into a smile and
with a queer little note of surprise in his throat and a twinkle in
his eye would make answer by slowly drawing from his coattail pocket
the three unjointed pieces holding them up with an air of triumph and
slowly putting them together Then these two old MerryAndrews would
lock arms and stroll into the library laughing like schoolboys

Tonight however as Nathan had been specially invited to play this
little ceremony was omitted On entering the hall the musician gave his
long black penwiper cloak and his hat to Malachi and supporting
himself by his delicate fingers laid flat on the halltable extended
first one thin leg and then the other while that obsequious darky
unbuttoned his gaiters His feet free he straightened himself up
pulled the precious flute from his coattail pocket and carefully
joined the parts This done he gave a look into the hallmirror
puffed out his scarf combed his straight white hair forward over his
ears with his fingers and at Malachis announcement glided through the
open doorway to Mrs Horns chair the flute in his hand held straight
out as an orator would have held his roll

The hostess who had been sitting by the fire her white gossamer shawl
about her spare shoulders rose from her highbacked chair and laying
aside her knittingneedles and wools greeted the musician with as much
cordialityand it must be confessed with as much ceremonyas if she
had not seen him a dozen times that week One of the charms of the Horn
mansion lay in these delightful blendings of affection and formality

Am I a little early he asked with as much surprise as if he were not
as certain to be early when music was concerned as he was to be late in
everything else Yes my dear madamI see that I am early unless
Miss Lavinia is late

You never could be too early Nathan Lavinia will be here in a
moment she answered with a smile resuming her seat

Im glad that Im ahead of her for once he replied laughing Then
turning to the inventor who had come forward from where he had been
studying the new score he laid his hand affectionately on Richards
shoulder as a boy would have done and added How do you like Ungers
new arrangementIve been thinking of nothing else all day

Capital Capital answered Richard slipping his arm into Nathans
and drawing him closer to the piano See how he has treated this
adagio phrase and he followed the line with his finger humming the
tune to Nathan The modulation you see is from E Major to A Major
and the flute sustains the melody the effect is so peculiarly soft and
the whole so bright with passages of sunshine all through itoh you
will love it

While these two whitehaired enthusiasts with their heads together were
studying the score beating time with their hands after the manner of
experts to whom all the curious jumble of dots and lines that plague so
many of us are as plain as print Malachi was receiving Miss
Clendenning in the hall Indeed he had answered her knock as Nathan
was passing into the drawingroom

The new arrival bent her neck until Malachi had relieved her of the
long hooded cloak gave a quick stamp with her little feet as she shook
out her balloon skirts and settled herself on the hallsettee while
Malachi unwound the white worsted nubia from her aristocratic throat
This done she too held a short consultation with the hallmirror
carefully dusting with her tiny handkerchief the little pats of
powder still left on her cheeks and with her jewelled fingers
smoothing the soft hair parted over her forehead and tightening
meanwhile the sidecombs that kept in place the clusters of short curls
which framed her face Then with head erect and a gracious recognition
of the old servants ministrations she floated past Malachi bent
double in her honor

Oh I heard you Nathan she laughed waving her fan toward him as
she entered the room Im not one minute late Did you ever hear such
impudence Sallie and all because he reached your door one minute
before me she added stooping to kiss Mrs Horn Punctuality was one
of the cardinal virtues of this most distinguished prim precise and
most lovable of old maids You are really getting to be dreadful Mr
Nathan Gill and so puffed upisnt he Richard As she spoke she
turned abruptly and faced both gentlemen Then with one of her
rippling laughsa laugh that Richard always said reminded him of the
notes of a birdshe caught her skirts in her fingers made the most
sweeping of courtesies and held out her hands to the two gentlemen who
were crossing the room to meet her

Richard with the bow of a Cavalier kissed the one offered him as
gallantly as if she had been a duchess telling her he had the rarest
treat in store for her as soon as Unger came and Nathan with mock
devotion held the other between his two palms and said that to be
scolded by Miss Clendenning was infinitely better than being praised by
anybody else These pleasantries over the two old gallants returned to
the piano to wait for Max Unger and to study again the crumpled pages
of the score which lay under the soft light of the candles

The room relapsed once more into its wonted quiet broken only by the
whispered talk of wellbred people careful not to disturb each other
Mrs Horn had begun to knit again Miss Clendenning stood facing the
fire one foot resting on the fender

This wee foot of the little lady was the delight and admiration of all
the girls about Kennedy Square and of many others across the seas
toomen and women for that matter Tonight it was encased in a black
satin slipper and in a white spiderweb stocking about which were
crossed two narrow black ribbons tied in a bow around the anklesuch a
charming little slipper peeping out from petticoats all bescalloped and
belaced Everything in fact about this dainty old maid with her trim
figure filling out her soft white fichu still had that subtlety of
charm which had played havoc with more than one heart in her day Only
Sallie Horn who had all the dear womans secrets knew where those
little feet had stepped and what hopes they had crushed Only Sallie
Horn too knew why the delicate finger was still bare of a plain gold
ring The world never thought it had made any difference to Miss
Lavinia but then the world had never peeped under the lower lid of
Miss Clendennings heart

Suddenly the hushed quiet of the room was broken by a loud knock at the
front door or rather by a series of knocks so quick and sharp that
Malachi started from his pantry on the run

That must be Max said Richard Now Lavinia we will move the
piano so as to give you more room

Mrs Horn pushed back her chair rose to her feet and stood waiting to
receive the noted cellist without whom not a note could be sounded
and Miss Clendenning took her foot from the fender and dropped her
skirts

But it was not Max

Not wheezy perspiring old Max Unger after all walking into the room
mopping his face with one hand and with the other lugging his big
cello embalmed in a green baize baghe would never let Malachi touch
itnot Max at all but a fresh rosycheeked young fellow of
twentytwo who came bounding in with a laugh tossing his hat to
Malachia wellknit muscular young fellow with a mouth full of white
teeth and a broad brow projecting over two steelblue eyes that were
snapping with fun

With his coming the quiet of the place departed and a certain breezy
atmosphere permeated the room as if a gust of cool wind had followed
him With him too came a hearty wholesouled joyousnessa
joyousness of so sparkling and so radiant a kind that it seemed as if
all the sunshine he had breathed for twenty years in Kennedy Square had
somehow been stored away in his boyish veins

Oh here you are you dear Miss Lavinia he cried out his breath
half gone from his dash across the Square How did you get here first

On my two feet you stupid Oliver cried Miss Lavinia shaking her
curls at him Did you think somebody carried me

No I didnt but that wouldnt be much to carry Miss Midget His
pet name for her But which way did you come I looked up and down
every path and

And went all the way round by Sue Claytons to find me didnt you
Oh you cant throw dust in the Midgets eyes you young rascal and
she stretched up her two dainty hands drew his face toward her and
kissed him on the lips

There and she patted his cheeknow tell me all about it you dear
Ollie What did you want to see me for she added with one of those
quick divinations that made her so helpful a confidante Then in a
lowered voiceWhat has Sue done

Nothingnot one thing She isnt bothering her head about me I only
stopped there to leave a book and

Mrs Horn with laughing inquiring eyes looked up from her chair at
Miss Clendenning and made a little doubting sound with her lips
Blackeyed Sue Clayton with her curls down her back home from
boardingschool for the Easter holidays was Olivers latest flame His
mother loved to tease him about his loveaffairs and always liked him
to have a new one She could see farther into his heart she thought
when the face of some sweet girl lay mirrored in its depths

Oliver heard the doubting sound his mother made and reaching over her
chair flung his arms about her neck and kissed her as if she had been
a girl

Now dont you laugh you dear old motherkins he cried drawing her
nearer to him until her face touched his Sue dont care a thing about
me and I did promise her the book and I ran every step of the way to
give it to herdidnt I Uncle Nat he added gayly hoping to divert
the topic You were behind the sundial when I passeddont you
remember He shrank a little from the badinage

The old musician heard the question but only waved his flute behind
him in answer He did not even lift his head from beside Richards at
the score

Oliver waited an instant and getting no further reply released his
hold about his mothers neck now that he had kissed her into silence
and turned to Miss Clendenning again

Come Miss Laviniacome into the library Ive something very
important to talk to you about Really now no nonsense about it
Youve plenty of timeold Max wont be here for an hour hes always
late isnt he mother

Miss Clendenning turned quietly lifted her eyes in a martyrlike way
toward Mrs Horn who shook her head playfully in answer and with
Olivers arm about her entered the library She could never refuse any
one of the young people when they came to her with their secretsmost
important and nevertobepostponed secrets of course that could
hardly wait the telling Her little tearoom across the Square with
its red damask curtains its shiny brass andirons easychairs and
lounges was really more of a confessional than a boudoir Many a
sorrow had been drowned in the cups of tea that she had served with her
own hand in eggshell Spode cups and many a young girl and youth who
had entered its cosey interior with heavy hearts had left it with the
sunshine of a new hope breaking through their tears But then everybody
knew the bigness of Miss Clendennings sympathies It was one of the
things for which they loved her

She of course knew what the boy wanted now If it were not to talk
about Sue Clayton it was sure to be about some one of the other girls
The young people thought of nothing else but their loveaffairs and
talked of nothing else and the old people loved to live their youth
over again in listening It was one of the traditional customs of
Kennedy Square

Miss Clendenning settled herself in a corner of the carved haircloth
sofa touched her sidecombs with her finger to see that they were in
place tucked a red cushion behind her back crossed her two little
feet on a low stool the two toes peeping out like the heads of two
mice and taking Olivers hand in hers said in her sweet coaxing
voice

Now you dear boy it is Sue isnt it

No

Not Sue Who then

Mr Crocker

What Mr Crocker She arched her eyebrows and looked at him in
surprise The name came as a shock She knew of Mr Crocker of course
but she wanted Oliver to describe him Surely she thought with a
sudden sense of alarm the boy has not fallen in love with the daughter
of that shabby old man

Why the landscapepainterthe one father knows I have been taking
drawing lessons of him and he says Ive got a lot of talent and that
all I want is practice He says that if I begin now and draw from the
cast three or four hours a day that by the end of the year I can begin
in color and then I can go to New York and study and then to Paris

The little lady scrutinized him from under her eyelids The boys
enthusiasm always delighted her she would often forget what he was
talking about so interested was she in following his gestures as he
spoke

And what then

Why then I can be a painter of course Isnt that a great deal better
than sitting every day in Judge Ellicotts dingy office reading
lawbooks I hate the law

And you love Mr Crocker

Yes dont you

I dont know him Ollie Tell me what he is like

Well he isnt young any more Hes about fathers age but hes a
splendid old man and hes so poor Nobody buys his pictures nor
appreciates him and just think he has to paint portraits and dogs
and anything he can get to do Dont you think thats a shame Nobody
goes to see him but father and Uncle Nat and one or two others They
dont seem to think him a gentleman He was putting the case so as to
enlist all her sympathies at once

He has a daughter hasnt he She was probing him quietly and without
haste Time enough for her sympathies to work when she got at the facts

Yes but I dont like her very much for I dont think shes very good
to him Miss Clendenning smothered a little sigh of relief there was
no danger thank Heaven in that direction What then could he want
she thought to herself

And hes so different from anybody I ever met Oliver continued He
doesnt talk about horses and duckshooting and politics or music or
cards like everyone you meet except Daddy but he talks about pictures
and artists and great men Just think he was a young student in
Dusseldorf for two years and then he shouldered a knapsack and tramped
all through Switzerland painting as he went and often paying for his
lodgings with his sketches Then he was in Paris for ever so long and
now he is here where

Where you tell me he is painting dogs for a living interrupted Miss
Clendenning Do you think you young scapegrace that this would be
better than being a lawyer like Judge Ellicott and she turned upon
him with one of her quick outbursts of mock indignation

But Im not going to paint dogs he replied with some impatience I
am going to paint women like the Sir Peter Lely that Uncle John
Tilghman has Oh shes a beauty I took Mr Crocker to see her the
other day It had just been brought in from the country you know You
should have heard him go on He says theres nobody who can paint a
portrait like it nowadays He raved about her You know it is Uncle
John Tilghmans grandmother when she was a girl His voice suddenly
dropped to a more serious tone as he imparted this last bit of
information

Miss Clendenning knew whose grandmother it was and knew and loved
every tone in the canvas It had hung in the Tilghman ManorHouse for
years and was one of its most precious treasures but she did not
intend to stop and discuss it now

Mr Crocker wants me to copy it just as soon as I draw a little
better Uncle John will let me I know

Miss Clendenning tapped her foot in a noiseless tattoo upon the stool
and for a time looked off into space She wanted to draw him out to
know from what depth this particular enthusiasm had sprung She was
accustomed to his exuberance of spirits it was one of the many things
she loved him for If this new craze were but an idle fancy and he had
had many of them it would wear itself out and the longer they talked
about it the better If however it sprang from an inborn taste and
was the first indication of a hitherto undeveloped talent forcing
itself to the surface the situation was one demanding the greatest
caution Twigs like Oliver bent at the wrong time might never
straighten out again

And why did you come to me about this Ollie why dont you talk to
your father

I have He doesnt object He says that Mr Crocker is one of the rare
men of the time and that only inexperience among the people here
prevents him from being appreciated Thats what he goes to see him
for It isnt father that worries me its mother I know just whet
shell say Shes got her heart set on my studying law and she wont
listen to anything else I wouldnt object to the law if I cared for
it but I dont Thats what makes it come so hard

And you want me to speak to your mother

Yes of course Thats just what I DO want you to do Nobody can help
me but you he cried with that coaxing manner which would have seemed
effeminate until one looked at his wellbuilt muscular body and the
firm lines about his mouth You tell her of all the painters you knew
in London when you lived there and of what they do and how they are
looked up to and that some of them are gentlemen and not idlers and
loafers Mother will listen to you I know and maybe then when I tell
her it wont be such a shock to her Do you know it is incomprehensible
to me all this contempt for people who dont do just the same things
that their grandfathers did And how do I know too that they are
right about it all It seems to me that when a man is born a gentleman
and is a gentleman he can follow any occupation he pleases Instead of
his trade making him respectable he should make IT so He spoke with a
virility she had never suspected in him before this boy whom she had
held in her arms as a baby and who was still only the child to her

But Ollie she interrupted in some surprise you must never forget
that you are your fathers son No one is absolutely independent in
this world everyone has his family to consider She was becoming not
only interested now but anxious Mr Crocker had evidently been
teaching the boy something besides the way to use his pencil Such
democratic ideas were rare in Kennedy Square

Yes I know what you mean He had sprung from his seat now and was
standing over her she looking up into his face You mean that it is
all right for me to go into old Mr Wardells countinghouse because he
sells coffee by the cargo but that I cant take a situation in
Griggsons grocery here on the corner because he sells coffee by the
pound You mean too that it is possible for a man to be a professor
or president of a college and still be a gentleman but if he teaches
in the public school he is done for You mean too that I could saw
off a patients leg and still be invited to Uncle Tilghmans house to
dinner but that if I pulled out one of his teeth I could only eat in
his kitchen

Miss Clendenning threw back her head and laughed until the combs in her
sidecurls needed refastening but she did not interrupt him

I cant get this sort of thing into my head and I never will And
father doesnt believe in it any more than I do and I dont think that
mother would if it wasnt for a lot of old people who live around this
square and who talk of nothing all day but their relations and think
theres nobody worth knowing but themselves Now youve GOT to talk to
mother I wont take no for an answer and he threw himself down
beside her again Come dear Midget hold up your right hand and
promise me now before I let you go he pleaded in his wheedling way
that made him so lovable to his intimates catching her two hands in
his and holding them tight

Of course she promised Had she ever refused him anything And Oliver
a boy again now that his confessions were made kissed her joyously on
both cheeks and instantly forgetting his troubles as his habit was when
prospects of relief had opened he launched out into an account of a
wonderful adventure Mr Crocker once had in an old town in Italy where
he was locked up overnight in a convent by mistake and how he had
slept on his knapsack in the chapel and what the magistrate had said
to him the next day and how he had to paint a portrait of that
suspicious officer to prove he was a painter and a man of the best
intentions In his enthusiasm he not only acted the scene but he
imitated the gesture and dialect of the several parties to the escapade
so perfectly that the little lady in her delight over the story quite
forgot her anxiety and even the musicale itself and only remembered
the quartette when Malachi bowing obsequiously before her said

Deys awaitin for you Miss Lavinia Mister Unger done come and
Marse Richard say he cant wait a minute

When she and Oliver entered the drawingroom the cellist was the
centre of the group He was stripping off the green baize cover from
his instrument and at the same time was apologizing in his broken
English for being so late Richard was interrupting him with
enthusiastic outbursts over the new score which still lay under the wax
candles lighting the piano and which he and Nathan while waiting for
the musician had been silently practising in sundry bobs of their
heads and rhythmic beatings of their hands

My dear Max Richard continued with a hand on the musicians
shoulder patting him in appreciation as he spoke we will forgive you
anything You have so exactly suited to the cello the opening theme
And the flute passagesthey are exquisitely introduced We will let
Miss Clendenning decide when she hears it and he turned Ungers head
in the direction of the advancing lady Here she comes now you of
course know the fine quality of Miss Clendennings ear

Herr Unger placed his five fat fingers over his waistbaud bowed as
low to Miss Lavinia as his great girth would permit and said

Ah yes I know Miss Clendenning not only haf de ear she haf de life
in de end of de finger De piano make de sound like de bird when she
touch it

The little lady thanked him in her sweetest voice made a courtesy and
extended her hand to Max who kissed it with much solemnity and
Richard putting his arm around the cellists fat shoulders conducted
him across the room whereupon Nathan with the assumed air of an old
beau offered his crooked elbow to Miss Clendenning as an apology for
having reached the house before her Then seating her at the piano
with a great flourish he waved his hand to Oliver who had drawn up a
chair beside his mother and with a laugh cried

Here you young love come and turn the leaves for Miss Lavinia It
may keep you from running over other people in the dark even if they
are accused of hiding behind sundials

With the beginning of the overture Mrs Horn laid down her work and
drawing her white gossamer shawl about her shoulders gave herself up to
the enjoyment of the music The overture was one of her favoritesone
she and Richard had often played together as a duet in their younger
days

Leaning back in her easychair with halfclosed eyes her clearcut
features in silhouette against the glow of the fire her soft gray
curls nestling in the filmy lace that fell about her temples she
expressed in every line of her face and figure that air of graceful
repose which only comes to those highly favored women who have all
their lives been nurtured in a home of loving hands tender voices and
noiseless servantslives of neverending affection without care or
sorrow

And yet had you even as she sat there studied carefully this central
figure of the Horn mansionthis practical outspoken gentlevoiced
tender wife and mother tenacious of her opinions yet big enough and
courageous enough to acknowledge her mistakes this woman wise in
counsel sympathetic in sorrow joyous with the young restful with the
old you would have discovered certain lines about her white forehead
which advancing years alone could not have accounted for

These lines seemed all the deeper tonight Only a few hours before
Richard had come to her while Malachi was arranging his clothes with
the joyful news of a new device which he had developed during the day
for his motor He could hardly wait to tell her he had said The news
was anything but joyful to her She knew what it meantshe knew what
sums had been wasted on the other devices involving losses which at
this time they could so little afford She was glad therefore to free
her mind for the moment from these anxieties glad to sit alone and
drink in the melodies that the quartette set free

As she sat listening beating time noiselessly with her thin upraised
hand her head resting quietly a clear silvery noteclear as a
birdsleaped from Nathans flute soared higher and higher trembled
like a lark poised in air and died away in tones of such exquisite
sweetness that she turned her head in delight toward the group about
the piano fixing her gaze on Nathan The old mans eyes were riveted
on the score his figure bent forward in the intensity of his
absorption his whole face illumined with the ecstasy that possessed
him Then she looked at Richard standing with his back to her his
violin tucked under his chin his body swaying in rhythm with the
music Unger sat next to him his instrument between his knees his
stolid shiny face unruffled by the glorious harmonies of Beethoven

Then her glance rested on Oliver He was hanging over the piano
whispering in Miss Clendennings ear his face breaking into smiles at
her playful chidings If the pathos of the melody had reached him he
showed no sign of its effects

Instantly there welled up in her heart a sudden gush of tendernessone
of those quick outbursts that often overwhelm a mother when her eyes
rest on a son whose heart is her ownan outburst all the more
intensified by the melody that thrilled her Why should her heart have
been troubled Here was her strong hope Here was her chief reliance
Here the hope of the future How could she doubt or suffer when this
promise of the coming day was before her in all the beauty and strength
of his young manhood

With the echoes of Nathans flute still vibrating in her and with her
mind filled with the delight of these fresh hopes she suddenly
recalled the anxious look on her boys face as he led Miss Clendenning
into the librarya new lookone she had never seen before Still
under the quickening spell of the music she began to exaggerate its
cause What had troubled him Why had he told Lavinia and not her Was
there anything serioussomething he had kept from her to save her
pain

From this moment her mind became absorbed in her boy With restless
impatient fingers she began thrumming on the arm of her chair Oliver
would tell her she knew before many hours but she could not
waitshe wanted to know at once

With the ending of the first part of the overture and before the two
gentlemen had laid down their instruments to grasp Ungers hands she
called to Miss Clendenning who sat at the piano alone Oliver having
slipped away unobserved

Miss Clendenning raised her eyes in answer Come over and sit by me
dear while the gentlemen rest

Miss Clendenning picked up her white silk mits and fan lying beside the
candles and moved toward the fireplace Malachi saw her cominghe was
always in the room during the interludesand with an alacrity common
to him when the distinguished little lady was present drew up a low
chair beside his mistress and stood behind it until she took her seat
Miss Clendenning smoothed out her skirt and settled herself with the
movement of a pigeon filling her nest Then she laid her mits in her
lap and fanned herself softly

Well Sallie what is it Did you ever hear Nathan play so well she
asked at last

What did Oliver want my dear replied Mrs Horn ignoring her
question Is there anything worrying him or is Sue at the bottom of
it

The little woman smiled quizzically No Sallienot Suenot this
time That little rattlebrains affections will only last the week
out Nothing very importantthat is nothing urgent We were talking
about the Tilghman portraits and the Lely that Cousin John has brought
into town from Claymore Manor and what people should and should not do
to earn their living and what professions were respectable I thought
one thing and Ollie thought another Now what profession of all others
would you choose for a young man starting out in life

What has he been telling you Lavinia Does he want to leave Judge
Ellicotts office Mrs Horn asked quietly She always went straight
to the root of any matter

Just answer my question Sallie

Id rather hed be a lawyer of course why

Suppose he wont or cant

Is that what he told you Lavinia on the sofa She was leaning
forward her cheek on her hand her eyes fixed on the blazing logs

He told me a great many things half of them boys talk Now answer my
question suppose he couldnt study law because his heart wasnt in it
what then

I know Lavinia what you mean There was an anxious tone now in the
mothers voice And Oliver talked to you about this As she spoke she
settled back in her chair and a slight sigh escaped her

Dont ask me Sallie for Im not going to tell you I want to know
for myself what you think so that I can help the boy

Mrs Horn turned her head and looked toward Richard She had suspected
as much from some hints that Judge Ellicott had dropped when she had
asked him about Olivers progress He is still holding down his chair
Madam She thought at the time that it was one of the Judges
witticisms but she saw now that it had a deeper meaning After some
moments she said fixing her eyes on Miss Clendenning

Well now Lavinia tell me what YOU think I should like your
opinion What would you wish to do with him if he were your son

Miss Lavinia smiled and her eyes halfclosed For a brief moment there
came to her the picture of what such a blessing would have been Her
son No It was always somebody elses son or daughter to whom her
sympathy must go

Well Sallie she answeredshe was leaning over now her hands in
her lap apparently with lowered eyelids but really watching Mrs
Horns face from the corner of her eyeI dont think we can make a
clergyman out of him do you Mrs Horn frowned but she did not
interrupt No we cannot make a parson out of him I meant my love
something in surplices not in campmeetings of course Think of those
lovely pink cheeks in a high collar and Bishops sleeves wouldnt he
be too sweet for anything and she laughed one of her little cooing
laughs Nor a doctor she continued with a slight interrogation in
her tone nor a shopkeeper nor a painterand she shot a quick
glance from under her arching eyebrows at her companionbut Mrs
Horns face gave no signnor a musician Why not a musician Sallie
he sings like an angel you know She was planting her shafts all
about the target her eyes following the flight of each arrow

Mrs Horn raised her head and laid her hand firmly on Miss
Clendennings wrist

We wont have him a shopkeeper Lavinia she said with some
positiveness nor a barber nor a painter nor a cook nor a dentist
Well try and keep him a gentleman my dear whatever happens As for
his being a musician I think you will agree with me that music is
only possible as an accomplishment never when it is a profession Look
at that dear old man over thereand she pointed to Nathan who was
bending forward running over on his flute some passages from the score
his white hair covering his coatcollar behindso absolutely unfitted
for this world as he is so purposeless so hopelessly inert He
breathes his whole soul into that flute and yet

And a good deal comes out of it sometimes my deartonight for
instance laughed Miss Lavinia Did you catch those birdlike notes

Yes and they thrilled me through and through but sweet as they are
they havent helped him make a career

At this moment Richard called to Unger who had been sitting on the
sofa in the library cooling off he said as he mopped his head with
a red handkerchief one of Malachis cups in his hand

Miss Lavinia caught sight of the cellists advancing figure and rose
from her seat I must go now she said they want to play it again
She moved a step forward gave a glance at her sidecurls in the oval
mirror over the mantel stopped hesitatingly and then bending over
Mrs Horn said thoughtfully her hand on her companions shoulder
Sallie dont try to make water run uphill If Ollie belonged to me
Id let him follow his tastes whatever they were Youll spoil the
shape of his instep if you keep him wearing Chinese shoes and she
floated over to join the group of musicians

Mrs Horn again settled herself in her chair She understood now the
look on Olivers face She was right then something was really
worrying him The talk with Miss Lavinia had greatly disturbed her
so much so that she could not listen to the music Again her eyes
rested on Oliver who had come in and joined the group at the piano
all out of breath with his second run across the Squarethis time to
tell Sue of Miss Clendennings promise He was never happy unless he
was sharing what was on his mind with another and if there was a girl
within reach he was sure to pour it into her willing ears

Mrs Horn looked at him with a pang about her heart From which side of
the house had come this fickleness this instability and love of change
in Olivers character she asked herselfa new interest every dayall
the traditions of his forefathers violated How could she overcome it
in him how make him more practical Years before when she had thought
him proud she had sent him to market and had made him carry home the
basket on his arm facing the boys who laughed at him He had never
forgotten the lesson he was neither proud nor lazy any more But what
could she do in a situation like this

Harassed by these doubts her eyes wandered over Olivers slender
wellknit muscular figure as he stood whispering to Miss Clendenning
She noticed the fine glossy hair brushed from the face and worn long
in the neck curling behind the ears She noted every movement of his
body the graceful way in which he talked with his hands using his
fingers to accentuate his words and the way in which he shrugged his
shouldersthe shrug of a Frenchman although not a drop of their blood
could be found in his veinsand in the quick lifting of the hand and
the sidelong glance of the eye all so characteristic of Richard when
some new thought or theory reached his brain for the first time
Gradually and unconsciously she began to compare each feature of
Olivers face with that of the father who stood beside him the alert
blue eyes overhanging brow and soft silkiness of the
hairidentically the name even the way it lay in the neck And again
she looked at Richard drawing the bow as if in a dream

Instantly a thought entered her mind that drove the blood from her
cheeks These vacillations of her husbands This turning from one
thing to anotherfirst the law then these inventions that never lead
anywhere and now Oliver beginning in the same way almost in the same
steps Could these traits be handed down to the children Would Oliver
be like Richard in

Instinctively she stopped short before the disloyal thought could form
itself in her brain straightened herself in her chair and closed her
lips tight

The music ceased Nathan laid his flute on the piano Unger rose from
his seat and Richard turned to talk to Miss Clendenning But she was
unmindful of it allshe still sat in her chair her eyes searching the
blazing logs her hands in her lap

Only Malachi with his silver tray recalled her to consciousness




CHAPTER III

THE OPENAIR DRAWINGROOMS OF KENNIDY SQUARE


If in the long summer days Kennedy Square was haunted by the idle and
the weary in the cool summer nights its dimly lighted paths were alive
with the tread of flying feet and its shadowy benches gay with the
music of laughter and merry greetings

With the going down of the sun the sidewalks were sprinkled and the
whole street about the Square watered from curb to curb to cool its
sunbaked cobbles The doors and windows of all the houses were thrown
wide to welcome the fresh nightair laden with the perfume of
magnolia jasmine and sweetsmelling box Easychairs and cushions
were brought out and placed on the clean steps of the porches and the
wide piazzas covered with squares of chinamatting to make ready for
the guests of the evening

These guests would begin to gather as soon as the twilight settled the
young girls in their pretty muslin frocks and ribbons the young men in
white duck suits and straw hats They thronged the cool wellswept
paths chattered in bunches under the big trees or settled like birds
on the stone seats and benches Every few minutes some new group fresh
from their teatables would emerge from one of the houses poise like
a flock of pigeons on the top step listen to the guiding sound of the
distant laughter and then swoop down in mad frolic settling in the
midst of the main covey under the big sycamores until roused at the
signal of some male bird in a straw hat or in answer to the call of
some bareheaded songstress from across the Square the whole covey
would dash out one of the rickety gates only to alight again on the
stone steps of a neighbors porch where their chatter and pipings
would last far into the night

It was extraordinary how from year to year these young birds and even
the old ones remembered the best perches about the Square On Colonel
Claytons ample porticobig enough to shelter half a dozen covies
behind its honeysucklesboth young and old would settle side by side
the younger bevy hovering about the Judges blueeyed daughtera bird
so blithe and of so free a wing that the flock always followed
wherever she alighted On Judge Bowmans wide veranda only a few old
cocks from the club could be found and not infrequently some rare
birds from out of town perched about a table alive with the clink of
glass and rattle of crushed ice while next the church on old Mrs
Pancoasts portico with its tall Corinthian columnsMr Pancoast was
the archdeacon of the Noahs ark churchone or two old grandmothers
and a grave old owl of a family doctor were sure to fill the
rockingchairs As for Richard Horns marble steps they were never free
from stray young couples who flew in to rest on Malachis chairs and
cushions Sometimes only one bird and her mate would be tucked away in
the shadow of the doorway sometimes only an old pair like Mrs Horn
and Richard would occupy its corners

These porticoes and stone doorsteps were really the openair
drawingrooms of Kennedy Square in the soft summer nights Here ices
were served and cool drinkssherbets for the young and juleps and
sherry cobblers for the old At the Horn house on great occasions as
when some big melon that had lain for days on the cool cellar floor was
cut it was worth a days journey to see Malachi cut a melon the
guests would not only crowd the steps but all the hall and half up the
slender staircase where they would sit with plates in their laps the
young men serving their respective sweethearts

This openair nightlife had gone on since Kennedy Square began each
doorstep had its habitues and each veranda its traditions There was
but one single porch in fact facing its stately trees whereon no
flocks of birds old or young ever alighted and that belonged to
Peter Skimmertonthe meanest man in townwho in a fit of parsimony
over candles so the girls said had bared his porch of every
protesting vine and had placed opposite his doorstep a glaring street
gaslampa monstrous and nevertobeforgotten affront

And yet free and easy as the life was no stranger sat himself down on
any one of these porches until his pedigree had been thoroughly
investigated no matter how large might be his bankaccount nor how
ambitious his soarings No premeditated discourtesy ever initialed this
exclusiveness and none was ever intended Kennedy Square did not know
the blood of the strangerthat was alland not knowing it they could
not trust him And it would have been altogether useless for him to try
to disguise his antecedentsespecially if he came from their own
Stateor any State south of it His record could be as easily reached
and could be as clearly read as a titledeed Even the servants knew
Often they acted as Clerks of the Rolls

Dat Mister Jawlins did you ask bout Malachi would say Why you
know whar he comes fom Hes one o dem Anne Rundle Jawlinses He do
look mighty peart an dey do say hes mighty rich but he cant fool
Malachi I knowed his granpa and that wise and politic darky with
the honor of the house before his eyes would shake his head knowingly
and with such an ominous look that had you not known the only crime of
the poor grandfather to have been a marriage with his overseers
daughtera very worthy woman by the wayinstead of with some lady of
quality you would have supposed he had added the sin of murder to the
crime of low birth On the other hand had you asked Malachi about some
young aristocrat who had forgotten to count his toddies the night
before that Defender of the Faith would have replied

Lawd bress ye Cose dese young gemmens like to frolican dey do git
dat way sometimestaint nuthin Dem Dorseys was allers like dat
the very tones of his voice carrying such convictions of the young
mans respectability that you would have felt safe in keeping a place
at your table for the delinquent despite your knowledge of his habits

This general intimacy between the young people and this absolute faith
of their elders in the quality of family blood was one of the reasons
why every man about Kennedy Square was to be trusted with every other
mans sister and why every mother gave the latchkey to every other
mothers son and why it made no difference whether the young people
came home early or late so that they all came home when the others
did If there were lovemakingand of course there was lovemakingit
was of the oldfashioned boyandgirl kind with keepsakes and pledges
and long walks in the afternoons and whispered secrets at the
merrymakings Never anything else Woe betide the swain who forgot
himself ever so slightlythere was no nightkey for him after that
nor would any of the girls on any front steps in town ever look his way
again when he passedand to their credit be it said few of the young
men either From that day on the offender became a pariah He had
committed the unpardonable sin

As for these young men this life with the girls was all the life they
knew There were fishing parties of course at the Falls when the
gudgeons were biting and picnics in the woods and there were oyster
roasts in winter and watermelon parties in summerbut the girls must
be present too For in those simple days there were no special clubs
with easychairs and convenient little tables loaded with drinkables
and smokablesnone for the young Olivers and certainly none for the
women There was to be sure in every Southern city an old mausoleum
of a clubsometimes twoeach more desolate than the otherhaunted by
gouty old parties and bonvivants but the young men never passed
through their doors except on some call of urgency When a man was old
enough to be admitted to the club there was no young damosel on
Malachis steps or any other steps who would care a rap about him
HIS day was done

For these were the days in which the woman ruled in court and
homechampioned by loyal retainers who strove hourly to do her
bidding Even the grayhaired men would tell you over their wine of
some rare woman whom they had known in their youth and who was still
their standard of all that was gentle and gracious and for whom they
would claim a charm of manner and stately comeliness thatmy dear
sir not only illumined her drawingroom but conferred distinction on
the commonwealth

Mrs Tilghmans mother were you talking about Colonel Clayton or
Richard Horn or some other old resident would ask I remember her
perfectly We have rarely had a more adorable woman sir She was a
vision of beauty and the pride of our State for years

Should some shadow have settled upon any one of these homessome
shadow of drunkenness or love of play or shattered brain or
worsethe woman bore the sorrow in gentleness and patience and still
loved on and suffered and loved and suffered again hoping against
hope But no dry briefs were ever permitted to play a part dividing
heart and hearth Kennedy Square would have looked askance had such
things been suggested or even mentioned in its presence and the dames
would have lowered their voices in discussing them Even the men would
have passed with unlifted hats either party to such shame

Because of this loyalty to womankind and this reverence for the homea
reverence which began with the motherlove and radiated to every sister
they knewno woman of quality ever earned her own bread while there
was an ablebodied man of her blood above ground to earn it for her
Nor could there be any disgrace so lasting even to the third and
fourth generation as the stigma an outraged community would place upon
the renegade who refused her aid and comfort An unprogressive
quixotic life if you willa life without growth and dominant
personalities and lofty responsibilities and Godgiven rightsbut oh
the sweet mothers that it gave us and the wholesomeness the
cleanliness the loyalty of it all


With the coming of summer then each white marble step of the Horn
mansion under Malachis care shone like a china plate

Cant hab dese yere young ladies spile dere clean frocks on Malachis
stepsno sah he would say Marse Oliverd rar an pitch turble

There were especial reasons this year for these extra touches of rag
and brush Malachi knew de signs too well to be deceived Pretty Sue
Clayton with her soft eyes and the mass of ringlets that framed her
face had now completely taken possession of Olivers heart and the
old servant already had been appointed chief of the postal servicetwo
letters a day sometimes with all the verbal messages in between

This loveaffair which had begun in the winter was not yet of so
serious a nature as to cause distress or unhappiness to either one of
their respective houses nor had it reached a point where suicide or an
elopement were all that was left It was in truth but a few months
old and so far the banns had not been published Within the last week
Miss Sue had been persuaded to wait for him that was all She had
not it is true burdened her gay young heart with the number of years
of her patience She and Oliver were sweetheartsthat was enough for
them both As proof of it was she not wearing about her neck at the
very moment a chain which he had fashioned for her out of
cherrystones and had she not given him in return one of those same
ringlets and had she not tied it with a blue ribbon herself And above
alland what could be more conclusivehad she not taken her hair down
to do it and let him select the very tress that pleased him bestand
was not this curl at that very moment concealed in a pillbox and
safely hidden in his unlocked bureaudrawer where his mother saw it
with a smile the last time she put away his linen This loveaffairas
were the loveaffairs of all the other young peoplewas common gossip
around Kennedy Square Had there been any doubts about it it would
only have been necessary to ask any old Malachi or Hannah or Juno
They could have given every detail of the affair descanting upon all
its joys and its sorrows

Sweet girls of the days gone by what crimes some of you have to answer
for At least one of you must remember how my own thumb was cut into
slits over these same cherrystones and why the ends of your ringlets
were tucked away in a miniature box in my drawer with the pressed
flowers and signetring and the rest of it And you couldif you
wouldrecall a waiting promise made to me years and years ago And the
wedding Surely you have not forgotten that I was there you
rememberbut not as the groom


On one particular evening in Junean evening that marked an important
stage in the development of Olivers fortunesthe front porch owing
to Malachis attentions was in spotless conditionsteps knocker and
round silver knobs

Sue and Oliver sat on the top step they had stolen across from the
Clayton porch on some pretended errand Sues chin was in her hand and
Oliver sat beside her pouring out his heart as he had never done
before He had realized long ago that she could never understand his
wanting to be a painter as Miss Clendenning had done and so he had
never referred to it since the night of the musicale when he had raced
across the Square to tell her of his talk with the little lady Sue as
he remembered afterward had listened abstractedly She would have
preferred at the time his running in to talk about herself rather than
about his queer ambitions She was no more interested now

Ollie what does your father say about all this she finally asked in
a perfunctory way Would he be willing for you to be a painter It
bored her to listen to Olivers enthusiastic talk about light and
shade and color and perspective and what Mr Crocker had said and
what Mr Crocker was doing and what Mr Crockers last portrait was
like She was sure that nobody else around Kennedy Square talked of
such things or had such curious ambitions They shocked her as much as
Olivers wearing some outlandish clothes would have donemaking him
conspicuous and perhaps an object of ridicule

Fathers all right Sue Hes always right Oliver answered He
believes in Mr Crocker just as he believes in a lot of things that a
good many people around here dont understand He believes the time
will come when they will value his pictures and be proud to own them
But I dont care who owns mine I just want the fun of painting them
Just think of what a man can do with a few tubes of color a brush and
a bit of canvas So I dont care if they never buy what I paint I can
get along somehow just as Mr Crocker does Hes poor but just see
how happy he is Why when he does a good thing hes nothing but a boy
hes so glad about it I always know how his work has gone when I see
his face

But Ollie hes so shabby and his daughter gives musiclessons
Nobody THINKS of inviting her anywhere Sues eyes were shut tight
with an expression of assumed contempt and her little nose was
straight up

Yesbut that doesnt hurt his pictures Sue There was a slight
trace of impatience in Olivers tone

Well perhaps it doesntbut you dont want to be like him I
wouldnt like to see you Ollie going about with a picture under your
arm that everybody knew you had painted yourself And suppose that they
would want to buy your pictures How would you feel now to be taking
other peoples money for things you had painted

The boy caught his breath It seemed useless to pursue the talk with
Sue She evidently had no sympathy with his aspirations

Nobut I wish I could paint as he does he answered mechanically

Sue saw the change in his manner She realized too that she had hurt
him in some way She drew nearer and put her hand on his arm

Why you can Ollie You can do anything you want to Miss Lavinia
told me so The little witch was mistress of one artthat of holding
her loverbut that was an art of which all the girls about Kennedy
Square approved

No I cant he replied forgetting in the caressing touch of her
hand the tribute to his ability and delighted that she was once more
in sympathy with him Mother wouldnt think of my being an artist She
doesnt understand how I feel about it and Miss Lavinia somehow
doesnt seem to be favorable to it either Ive talked to her lots of
timesshe was more encouraging at first but she doesnt seem to like
the idea now Ive been hoping shed fix it so I could speak to mother
about it Now she tells me I had better wait I cant see why Miss
Lavinia knows what an artists life can be for she knew plenty of
painters when she was in London with her father and she loves
pictures too and is a good judgenobody here any better She told me
only a week ago how much one of these Englishmen was paid for a little
thing as big as your hand but Ive forgotten the amount I dont see
why I cant paint as well as those fellows Do you know Sue Im
beginning to think that about half the people in Kennedy Square are
asleep They really dont seem to think there is anything respectable
but the law If they are right how about all the men who painted the
great pictures and built all the cathedrals or the men who wrote all
the poems and histories Mother of course wants me to be a lawyer
Because Im fitted for itnot a bit of it Simply because father was
one before me and his father before him and Uncle John Tilghman
another and so on back to the deluge

Sue drew away a little and turned her head toward the Square as if in
search of someone Oliver noticed the movement and his heart sank
again He saw but too clearly how little impression the story of his
ambitions had made upon her Then the thought flashed into his mind
that he might have offended her in some way clashing against her
traditions and her prejudices as he had done He bent toward her and
laid his hand in hers

Little girl he said in a softened tone I cant make you unhappy
too Mother is enough for me to worry aboutI havent talked it all
out to you before but dont you get a wrong idea of what Im going to
do and he looked up into her face and tightened his hold upon her
fingers his eyes never wavering from her own

The girl allowed his hand to remain an instant then quickly withdrew
her own and started up Coyness is sometimes fear in the timid heart
that is stepping into the charmed circle for the first time

There goes Ella Dorsey and Jack she cried springing down the
steps Ella Ella and an answering halloo came back and the two
started from Malachis steps and raced up the street to join their
young friends




CHAPTER IV

AN OLDFASHIONED MORTGAGE


Pretty Sue Clayton with her ringlets and rosy cheeks had not been
Olivers only listener

His mother had been sitting inside the drawingroom just beside the
open window She had spoken to Sue and Oliver when they first mounted
the steps and had begged them both to come in but they had forgotten
her presence Unintentionally therefore she had heard every word of
the conversation Her old fears rushed over her again with renewed
force She had never for a moment supposed that Oliver wanted to be a
painterlike Mr Crocker Now at last she understood his real object
in talking to Lavinia the night of the musical

Richard she called softly to her husband sitting in the adjoining
room in the chair that Malachi in accordance with the old custom had
with his sweeping bow made ready for him The inventor had been there
since tea was over lying back in his seat his head resting on his
hand He had had one of his thoughtful days worrying over some detail
of his machine still incomplete The new device of which he had told
her with such glee had failed as had the others The motor was still
incomplete

Richard she repeated

Yes my dear he answered in his gentle voice He had not heard her
at first

Bring your chair over here

The inventor rose instantly and crossing the room took a seat beside
her his hand finding hers in the dark

What is this you have been saying to Oliver about artists being great
men she asked Hes got a new idea in his head nowhe wants to be a
painter Ive thought for some time that Mr Crocker was not a proper
person for him to be so much with He has evidently worked on the boys
imagination until he has determined to give up the law and study art

How do you know

Ive just heard him tell Sue Clayton so All he wants now is my
consenthe says he has yours

The inventor paused and gently smoothed his wifes fingers with his
own

And you would not give it he inquired

How could I It would ruin himdont you know it There was a slight
tinge of annoyance in her voicenot one of faultfinding but rather
of anxiety

That depends my dear on how well he could succeed he answered
gently

Why Richard She withdrew her hand quickly from his caressing touch
and looked at him in undisguised astonishment What has his SUCCEEDING
to do with it Surely you cannot be in earnest I am willing he should
do anything to make his living but not that No one we know has ever
been a painter It is neither respectable nor profitable You see what
a dreadful existence Mr Crocker leadshardly an associate in town
and no acquaintances for his daughter and hes been painting ever
since he was a boy Oliver could not earn a penny at such work

Money is not everything my dear nor social recognition There are
many things I would value more

What are they She was facing him now her brows knit a marked
antagonism in her voice

Good manners and good taste Sallie and kindly consideration for
anothers feelings he answered He spoke calmly and kindly as was
his custom He had lived almost all his life with this highstrung
Sallie Horn whose eyes flashed now and then as they had done in the
old days when he won her hand He knew every side of her temperament
Good manners and good tastehe repeated as if wishing to emphasize
his thoughtsOliver has all of these and he has besides loyalty to
his friends He never speaks of Mr Crocker but with affection and I
love to hear him That man is an artist of great talent and yet it
seems to be the fashion in this town to ridicule him If Ollie has any
gifts which would fit him to be a painter I should be delighted to see
him a painter It is a profession despised now as are many others but
it is the profession of a gentleman for all they say and a noble
one Then he stopped and said thoughtfully as if communing with
himselfI wish he could be a painter Since Gilbert Stuarts time we
have had so few men of whom we can boast This country will one day be
proud to honor her artists

Mrs Horn sank back in her chair She felt the hopelessness of all
further discussion with her husband He would not have talked this way
ten years ago she said to herself Everything has gone wrong since
he left the law But to her husband she said

You always measure everything by your hopes Richard and you never
look at the practical side of anything Ollie is old enough to begin to
think how he will earn his bread I see now how hopeless it is for us
to try and make a lawyer of himhis heart is not in it I have come
little by little to the conclusion that what he wants most is hard
work and he wants it right away just as soon as we can find something
for him to dosomething with his hands if necessary not something
full of dreams and imaginings and her voice rose in its earnestness
I am getting more and more anxious about him every day she added
suddenly controlling herself and when you encourage him in foolish
vagaries you only make it harder for me dear and her voice softened
and broke with emotion

He ought to have gone into the laboratory Sallie Richard added
quickly in a reflective tonelaying his hand on her shoulder as he
noticed the change of voicejust as I wanted him to do when he left
school There is a future for scientific men in this country which you
do not seea future which few around me seem to see Great changes are
coming not only in science but in the arts and in all useful
knowledge If Ollie can add to the brilliancy of this future by
becoming a brilliant painter able to help educate those about him
there could be no higher calling for him Three things are coming my
dearperhaps four The inventor had risen from his seat and stood
beside her his eyes turned away into the dark as if he were addressing
some unseen person The superseding of steam aerial locomotion and
the education of the common people black and white One other may
comethe freeing of the slavesbut the others are sure Science not
money nor family traditions nor questions of birth will shape the
destinies of the country We may not live to see it but Oliver will
and I want him to be where he can help on the movement You were
opposed to his becoming a scientist and I feel assured made a mistake
Dont stand in his way again dear

Yes Richard I was opposed to it because I did not want him to waste
his time over all sorts of foolish experiments which would
certainly She did not finish the sentence Her anxiety had not yet
gone as far as that With a quick gesture she rose from her chair and
drawing her white gossamer shawl about her shouldersleft the room and
walked out onto the front steps followed by Richard

If the inventor heard the thrust he did not reply He would not argue
with his wife over it nor did it check the flow of his courtesy She
had never seen the value of what he was striving for but she would in
time he knew

Yes I think it is cooler out here was all he said as he placed a
cushion to soften her seat on the threshold When he had arranged
another pillow behind her back and hunted round the dark parlor for a
stool for her feet he found a chair for himself and sat down beside
her She thanked him but her thoughts were evidently far away She was
weighing in her mind what must be her next move if Oliver persisted in
this new departure Richard broke the silence

I havent told you of the good offer Ive had for the farm Sallie

No but were not going to sell it of course She was leaning back
against the jamb of the door as she spoke the shawl hanging loose her
delicate white hands in her lap It was an idle answer to an idle
question for her mind was still with Oliver

Well I hadnt thought of doing so until today he answered slowly
but I had a notice from the bank that they must call in the mortgage
and so I thought I might as well sell the whole place pay off the
debt and use the balance for

Sell the farm Richard It was her hand now that sought his and with
a firm grasp as if she would restrain him then and there in his purpose

Yes I can get several thousand dollars over and above the mortgage
and I need the money Sallie It will only be a temporary matter and
he smoothed her arm tenderly speaking as a lover of long standing
might do who is less absorbed with the caress than with the subject
under discussion The motor will be ready in a few weeksas soon as
the new batteries are finished Then my dear you wont have to
curtail your expenses as you have done His voice was full of hope
now a smile lighting his face as he thought of all the pleasure and
comfort his success would bring her

But you said that same thing when you were working on the steamvalve
for which you put that very mortgage on the farm and now thats all
gone and

The failure of the steamvalve as I have always told you was due to
my own carelessness Sallie I should have patented it sooner They are
making enormous sums on it I hear and are using my cutoff and I
think dishonestly But the motor has been protected at every new step
that I have taken My first patent of August 13 1856 supersedes all
others and cannot be shaken Now my dear dont worry about ityou
have never known me to fail and I wont now Besides you forget my
successes Salliethe turbine waterwheel and the others It will all
come right

It will never come right She had risen from her seat and was
standing over him both hands on his shoulders her eyes looking down
into his her voice trembling Oh Richard Richard Give up this life
of dreams you are living and go back to your lawoffice You always
succeeded in the law This new career of yours is ruining us I can
economize dear just as I have always done she added with another
sudden change of tone bending over him and slipping her hand
caressingly into his I will do everything to help you I did not mean
to be cross a moment ago I was worried about Olivers talk I have
been silent so longI must speak Dont be angry dear but you must
keep the farm I will go myself and see about the mortgage at the
bankwe cannotwe must not go on this waywe will have nothing
left

He patted her arm again in his gentle waynot to calm her fears he
knew so well that she was wrong but to quiet the nerves that he
thought unstrung

But I need this extra money for some improvements which I

Yes I know you THINK so but you dont Richard you dont For
Heavens sake throw the motor out into the street and be done with
it It will ruin us all if things go on as they have done

The inventor raised his eyes quickly He had never seen her so
disturbed in all their married life She had never spoken in this way
before

Dont excite yourself Sallie he said gravely and with a certain
air of authority in his manner Youll bring on one of your
headachesit will all come right Come my dear let us go into the
house People are passing and will wonder

She followed him back into the drawingroom his hand still held fast
in hers

Promise me one thing she said stopping at the door and looking up
into his eyes and I wont say another word Please do nothing more
about the farm unless you let me know Let me think first how I can
help It will all come out right as you say but it will be because we
will make it come right dear She drew his face down toward her with
one hand and kissed him tenderly on his cheek Then she bade him
goodnight and resumed her seat by the window to watch for Olivers
return

Try as she would she could not banish her fears The news of Richards
intention to pay off the loan by selling the farm had sent a shudder
through her heart such as she had never before experienced for that
which she had dreaded had come to pass Loyal as she had always been to
her husband and proud as she was of his genius and accomplishments
and sympathetic as they were in all else that their lives touched upon
her keen penetrating mind had long since divined the principal fault
that lay at the bottom of her husbands genius She saw that the weak
point in his makeup was not his inventive quality but his inability
to realize any practical results from his inventions when perfected
She saw too with equal certainty how rapidly their already slender
means were being daily depleted in costly experimentsmany of which
were abandoned as soon as tried and she knew full well that the end
was but a question of time Even when he had abandoned the law and had
exchanged his office near the Courthouse for his shop in the back
yard and had given his library to his young students she had not
despaired she still had faith in his genius

She had first become uneasy when the new steam cutoff had failed to
reimburse him When this catastrophe was followed by his losing every
dollar of his interest in the improved cottongin because of his
generosity to a brother inventor her uneasiness had become the keenest
anxiety And now here was this new motor in which he seemed more
absorbed than in any other of his inventions This was to plunge them
into still greater difficulties and jeopardize even the farm

Richard had not been disturbed by it all Serene and hopeful always
the money question had counted for nothing with him His compensation
lay in the fact that his theories had been proved true Moreover
there were he knew other inventions ahead and more important
discoveries to be made If money were necessary these new inventions
would supply it Such indifference to practical questions was an agony
to one of her temperament burdened as she was by the thought of their
increasing daily expenses the magnitude of which Richard never seemed
to appreciate

And yet until tonight when Richard had made his announcement about
the mortgage she had made no protest uttered no word of censure
Neither had any jar or discord ever disturbed the sweet harmony of
their homelife And she had only behaved as any other wife in Kennedy
Square would have done in like circumstances Remonstrances against a
husbands business methods were never made in the best families In his
own house Richard was master So she had suffered on and held her
peace while Richard walked with his head in the clouds unconscious of
her doubts The situation must now be met and she determined to face
it with all her might The farm shall not be sacrificed if I can help
it she kept repeating to herself any economy is better than that
disaster

When at last the shock of the news of the threatened disaster had
passed and she had regained her customary composure she decided to
act at once and at headquarters outside of Richards help or
knowledge She would send for Colonel Clayton one of the directors of
the bank in the morning and see what could be done to postpone for a
time the banks action This would give her time to think what next
could best be done to save the property This settled in her mind she
gave herself up to the more important and pressing need of the
momentthe dissuading of Oliver from this new act of folly

At the end of an hour she was still sitting by the drawingroom window
straining her eyes across the Square noting every figure that passed
into the radiance of the moonlight her mind becoming clearer as her
indomitable will which had never failed her in domestic crises began
to assert itself

When her eye fell at last upon her son he was walking with swinging
gait up the long path across the Square whistling as he came his
straw hat tilted on one side his short coat flying free He had taken
Sue home and the two had sat on her fathers steps in the moonlight
long after the other boys and girls had scattered to their homes The
Colonel had come in while they were talking and had bade them
goodnight and gone up to bed

Girl as she was Sue already possessed that subtle power of unconscious
coquetry which has distinguished all the other Sue Claytons of all the
other Kennedy Squares the South over since the days of Pocahontas She
had kept Olivers mind away from the subject that engrossed him and on
herself and when at last standing between the big columns of the
portico she had waved her hand goodnight and had gained his promise
to stop in the morning on his way to the office for just another word
she felt sure that his every thought was of her Then she had closed
the big front doorshe was the last person in the house awakeand
tripped upstairs not lighting her candle until she had peeped through
her shutters and had found him standing on the other side of the
street looking toward the house He made a handsome picture of a lover
as he stood in the moonlight and Sue smiled complacently to herself at
the delicate attention paid her but Olivers eyes the scribe is
ashamed to say were not fixed on the particular pair of green blinds
that concealed this adorable young lady certainly not with any desire
to break through their privacy One of the unforgivable sinsnay one
of the impossible sinsabout Kennedy Square would have been to have
recognized a lady who looked even during the daytime out from a
bedroom window much less at night That was why Sue did not open her
blinds

Nor indeed was Oliver occupied with the question of Sues blinds at
all He had for the moment in fact completely forgotten the existence
of his ladylove He was if the truth must be told studying the
wonderful effect of the white light of the moon flooding with its
radiance the columns and roof of the Clayton house the dark magnolias
silhouetted against the flight of steps and the indigoblue of the sky
He had already formulated in his mind the palette with which he would
paint it and had decided that the magnolias were blueblack and not
green and the steps greenishwhite He had furthermore determined to
make an outline of it in the daylight and talk to Mr Crocker about
it Sues eyes which but a moment before had so charmed him no longer
lingered in his memorynor even in any one of the far corners of his
head and heart It was only when her light flashed up that he awoke to
the realization of what he was doing and even this breach of good
manners was forgotten by him in his delight over the effect which the
red glow of the candle gave to the whole composition

With the picture clearly stamped upon his brain he turned and stepped
quickly across the Square and in another moment he had thrown his
mother a kiss through the window and rushing inside had caught her in
his arms

Poor motherkinsand you all alone he cried Why I thought you and
father had gone to bed long ago

No sonI was waiting for you He laid his fresh young face against
hers insisting that she must go to bed at once helping her upstairs
awkwardly laughing as he wenttelling her she was the sweetest girl
he ever knew and his best sweetheartkissing her pale cheeks as they
climbed the steps together to his room

She had determined as she sat by the window to talk to him of what
she had overheard him say to Sue and of her anxiety over Richards
revelations but his joyous kiss had robbed her of the power She would
wait for another timeshe said to herselfnot tonight when he was
so happy

Anybody at Sues Ollie she asked lighting his candle

Only the boys and girlsTom Pitts Charley Bowman Nellie Talbot and
one or two others The Colonel came in just before I left

But the Colonel will be home tomorrow will he not she asked
quickly as if something forgotten had been suddenly remembered

Yesthink so answered Oliver taking off his coat and hanging it
over the chairbecause he was just up from Pongateague He and Major
Pitts got thirtyseven woodcock in two days Tom wants me to go down
with him some day next week

A shade of anxiety crossed the mothers face

What did you tell him son She moved a chair nearer the bureau and
sat down to watch him undress as she had always done since the day she
first tucked him into his crib

Oh I said I would ask you He was loosening his cravat his chin
thrown up the light of the candle falling over his wellknit shoulders
and chest outlined through his white shirt

Better not go Ollieyouve been away so much lately

Oh dearie he protested in a tone as a child would have done what
does a day or two matter Be a darling old mother and let me go Tom
has a gun for me and Mr Talbot is going to lend us his red setter
Toms sister is going too and so are her cousins Just think now I
havent had a day in the country for a coons age His arms were round
her neck now He seemed happier over the excuse to caress her than
anxious about her possible refusal

She loosened one of his hands and laid it on her cheek

No holidays son Why you had two last week when you all went out to
Stemmers Run she said looking up into his face his hand still in
hers

Yes but that was fishing he laughed as he waved an imaginary rod in
his hands

And the week before when you spent the day at Uncle Tilghmans she
continued smiling sadly at him but with the light of an illconcealed
admiration on her face

Ah but mother I went to see the Lely Thats an education Oh that
portrait in pink He was serious now looking straight down into her
eyestalking with his hands one thumb in air as if it were a bit of
charcoal and he was outlining the Lely on an equally real canvas Such
color mothersuch an exquisite poise of the head and sweep to the
shoulder and the thumb described a curve in the air as if following
every turn of Lelys brush

Her eyes followed his gesturesshe loved his enthusiasm although she
wished it had been about something else

And you dont get any education out of the Judges lawbooks

No I wish I did The joyous look on his face was gone nowhis hand
had fallen to his side It gets to be more of a muddle every day
and then he added with the illogical reasoning of youthall the
lawyers that ever lived couldnt paint a picture like the Lely

Mrs Horn closed her eyes It was on her tongue to tell him she knew
what was in his heart but she stopped no not tonight she said
firmly to herself and shut her lips tighta way she had of bracing
her nerves in such emergencies

Oliver in turn saw the expression of anxiety that crossed his mothers
face and the thin drawn line of the lips One word from her and he
would have poured out his heart Then some shadow that crossed her face
silenced him No not tonight he said to himself She has been
sitting up for me and is tiredIll tell her tomorrow

Dont go with Tom Pitts my son she said calmly Id rather youd
stay I dont want you to go this time Perhaps a little later and a
slight shiver went through her as she rose from her chair and moved
toward him

He made no protest Her final word was always law to himnot because
she dominated him but because his nature was always to be in harmony
with the thing he loved Because too underneath it all was that
quality of tenderness to all women old and young which forbade him to
cause one of them pain Almost unconsciously to himself he had gone
through a process by which from having yielded her the obedience of a
child he now surrendered to her the pleasures of his youth when the
old feeling of maternal dominance still controlled her in her attitude
to him She did not recognize the difference and he had but
halfperceived it but the difference had already transformed him from
a boy into a man though with unrecognized powers of stability as yet
In obeying his mother then at twentytwo or even in meeting the whims
and conceits of his sweethearts this quality of tenderness to the
woman was always uppermost in his heart The surrender of a moments
pleasure seemed so little to him compared to the expression of pain he
could see cross their faces He had so much to make him happywhat
mattered it if out of a life so full he should give up any one thing to
please his mother

Patting him on the cheek and kissing him on the neck as she had so
often done when some sudden wave of affection overwhelmed her she bade
him goodnight at last

Once outside in the oldfashioned hall she stopped for a moment her
eyes fixed on the floor the light from the halllamp shining on her
silver hair and the shawl about her shoulders and said slowly to
herself as if counting each word

Whatcan I doto save this boyfromhimself




CHAPTER V

A MESSAGE OF IMPORTANCE


Richard when he waked made no allusion to the mortgage nor to his
promise the night before to take no steps in the matter without her
consent nor could Mrs Horn see that the inventor had given the
subject further thought He came in to breakfast with his usual
serenity of mien kissed her gallantly on the cheekin all their
married life this dear old gentleman had never forgotten this breakfast
kissand taking his seat opposite her he picked up the new Scientific
Review just in by the morning mail and began cutting the leaves She
tried to draw him into conversation by asking him when the note on the
mortgage was due but his mind was doubtless absorbed by some problem
suggested by the Review before him for without answeringhe of
course had not heard herhe rose from his chair excused himself for
a moment opened a book in his library studied it leisurely and only
resumed his seat when Malachi gently touched his elbow and said

Coffee purty nigh done spilt Marse Richard

Breakfast over Richard picked up his letters and with that faraway
look in his eyes which his wife knew so well walked to the closet
took down his long red calico gown slipped it over his coat and with
a loving pat on his wifes shoulder as he passed and with the request
that no one but Nathan should see him that morning made his way
through the damp brickpaved back yard to the green door of his lil
room

Mrs Horn watched his retreating figure from the windowhis head bent
his soft hair stirred by the morning air falling about his shoulders
His serenity his air of abstraction of being wrapped in the clouds as
it wereborne aloft by the power of a thought altogether beyond her
baffled her as it always did She could not follow his flights when he
was in one of these uplifted moods She could only watch and wait until
he returned again to the common ground of their daily love and
companionship

Brushing a quick tear from her eyes with an impatient sigh she
directed Malachi to go to Olivers room and tell him he must get up at
once as she wanted him to carry a message of importance She had
herself rapped at her sons door as she passed on her way downstairs
and Malachi had already paid two visits to the same portalone with
Olivers shoes and one on his own account He had seen his mistresss
anxiety and knowing that his young master had come in late the night
before had mistaken the cause charging Mrs Horns perturbation to
Olivers account The only response Oliver had made to either of his
warnings had been a smothered yawn and a protest at being called at
daylight On his third visit Malachi was more insistent the hallclock
by that time having struck nine

Aint you outen dat bed yit Marse Oliver Dis yeres de third time I
been yere Better git up yo mas gittin onresless

Coming Mally Tell mother Ill be down right away called Oliver
springing out of bed Malachi stepped softly downstairs again bowed
low to his mistress and with a perfectly straight face said

Hes mos ready mistis Jes abreshin ob his har when I opened de
do Spec Marse Oliver overslep hissef or maybe nobody aint call
him

He could not bear to hear the boy scolded He had begun to shield his
young master in the days when he carried him on his shoulder and he
would still shade the truth for him whenever he considered necessity
required it

When Oliver at last came downstairs it was by means of the handrail as
a slide a dash through the hall and a bound into the breakfastroom
followed by a joyous goodmorning meeting his mothers How could you
be so late my boy without any defence of his conduct putting one
hand under her chin and the other around her neck and kissing her
where her white hair parted over her forehead

Malachi waited an instant breathing freer when he found that his
statement regarding Olivers toilet had passed muster and then
shuffled off to the kitchen for hot waffles and certain other
comforting viands that Aunt Hannah the cook had kept hot for her
young master Malachis several reports having confirmed her suspicions
that Oliver as usual would be half an hour late

What a morning motherkins Oliver cried Such a sky all chinablue
and white Oh you just ought to see how fine the old church looms up
behind the trees Im going to paint that some day from my window Dad
had his breakfast and he glanced at the empty seat and plate
Sausage eh Mally got any for me and he dragged up his chair
beside her talking all the time as he spread his napkin and drew the
dishes toward him

He never once noticed her anxious face he was so full of his own
buoyant happiness She did not check his enthusiasm This
breakfasthour alone with her boyhe was almost always later than
Richardwas the happiest of the day But her heart was too heavy this
morning to enjoy it Instead of listening with her smile of quiet
satisfaction answering him now and then with a gayety of humor which
matched his own she was conscious only of the waiting for an
opportunity to break into his talk with out jarring upon his mood At
last with a hesitating emphasis that would have alarmed anyone less
wrapped in his own content than her son she said

Ollie when you finish your breakfast I want you on your way to Judge
Ellicotts office to stop at Colonel Claytons and ask him to be good
enough to come and see me as soon as he can on a little matter of
business Tell him I will keep him but a minute If you hurry my son
youll catch him before he leaves the house

The die was cast now She had taken her first step without Richards
hand to guide herthe first in all her life It was pain to do itthe
more exquisite because she loved to turn to him for guidance or relief
to feel the sense of his protection Heretofore he had helped her in
every domestic emergency his soft gentle hand soothing and quieting
her when troubles arose She had wavered during the night between her
duty to her family in saving the farm and her duty to her husband in
preserving unbroken the tie of loyal dependence that had always bound
them together Many emotions had shaken her as she lay awake her eyes
fixed on the flutings in the canopy of the highpost bedstead which the
nightlamp faintly illumined Richard asleep beside her dreaming
doubtless of cogs and pulleys and for the hundredth time of his finding
the one connecting link needed to complete the chain of his success

But before the day had broken her keen penetrating mind had cut
through the fog of her doubts Come what may the farm should never be
given up Richard for all his urgent need of money to perfect his new
motor should not be allowed to sacrifice this the only piece of landed
property which they possessed except the roof that sheltered them all
The farm saved she would give her attention to Olivers future career
On one point her mind was firmly made uphe should never in spite of
what his father said become a painter

Oliver hurried through his breakfast cut short Malachis second relay
of waffles to the great disappointment of that excellent servitor and
with his mothers message for the moment firmly fixed in his mind
tilted his hat on one side of his head and started across Kennedy
Square whistling as he went

Mrs Horn moved her seat to the window and looked out upon the
brickpaved yard The door of the shop was shut Richard was already at
work for a thin curl of blue smoke was rising from the chimney As she
sat looking out upon the tuliptree and the ivycovered wall beyond a
strange unaccountable sense of loneliness new in her experience came
over her The lines about her mouth settled more firmly and the
anxious look that had filled her eyes changed to one of determination

Nobody can help she said to herself with a sigh I must do it all
myself and picking up her basket of keys she mounted slowly to her
room

Once outside the front door with the fresh clear air stirring to a
silverwhite the leaves of the maples the birds singing in the
branches and the sky glistening overhead one of those sudden changes
of mood to which our young hero was subject swept over him The picture
of the dear mother whom he loved and whose anxious face had at last
filled his thoughts by some shifting of the gray matter of this
volatile young gentlemans brain had suddenly become replaced by
another

Pretty Sue Clayton her black eyes snapping with fun her hand so soon
to be outstretched in welcome was now the dominating figure in his
mental horizon Even Sir Peter Lelys girl in pink and the woodcock
shooting with Tom Pitts and all the other delights that had filled his
brain had become things of the past as he thought of Sues greeting
For the time being this blackeyed little witch with the ringlets about
her face had complete possession of him

He had not thought of her it is true for five consecutive minutes
since he had bidden her goodnight ten hours ago and he would I am
quite sure have forgotten even his promise to see her this morning had
not his mothers message made his going to her house imperative And
yet now that the prospect of having a glimpse of her face was assured
he could hardly wait until he reached her side

Not that he had some new thing to tell hersomething that had bubbled
up fresh from the depths of his heart overnight Indeed had that
portion of this young gentlemans anatomy been searched with a dark
lantern it can safely be said that not the slightest suggestion of
this fair inamoratas form or lineaments would have been found lurking
in any one of its recesses Furthermore I can state positivelyand I
knew this young gentleman quite well at the timethat it was not Sue
at all that he longed for at this precise moment even though he
hurried to meet her It was more the WOMAN IN HERthe something that
satisfied his inner nature when he was with herher coy touches of
confidence her artless outbursts of admiration looking up in his face
as she spoke the dimples playing about the corners of her mouth He
revelled in all those subtle flatteries and cajoleries and in all the
arts to please of which she was past mistress He loved to believe
hershe intended that he shouldwhen she told him how different he
was from anybody about Kennedy Square and how nobody swam or rode or
danced as he did nor wore their hair so becomingly nor their
clothesespecially the gray jacket buttoned up close under the chin
not carried themselves as they walked nor

Why go on We all know exactly how she said it and how sincere she
seemed and how we believed it all and do now some of us and how
blissful it was to sit beside her and hear her voice and know that this
most adorable of women really believed that the very sun itself rose
and set in our own adorable persons

Because of all this and of many other things with which we have nothing
to do our young hero saw only Sues eyes when that maiden who had
been watching for him at the library window laid her hand on the lapel
of his coat in her coaxing way No wonder he had forgotten everything
which his mother had asked him to do I can forgive him under the
circumstancesand so can you Soft hands are very beguiling
sometimesand halfclosed lidsWell It is a good many years ago but
there are some things that none of us ever forget

Blinded by such fascinations it is not at all astonishing that long
before Oliver regained his senses the Colonel had left the house for
the day That distinguished gentleman would no doubt have waited the
young princes pleasure in his library had he known of his errand But
since the Colonel had unfortunately taken himself off there was
nothing of course for our Oliver to do but to remain where he was
until noonthis was Sues way out of the difficultyand then to catch
the Colonel at the bank where he could always be found between twelve
and one oclock or where Mr Stiger the cashier could lay his hands
on him if he was anywhere in the neighborhood a suggestion of Sues
which at once relieved Oliver from further anxiety Mr Stiger being
one of his oldest and dearest friends

By the time however that Oliver had reached the bank the Colonel had
left for the club where he would have been too happy no doubtbeing
the most courteous of colonels etc etcif his dear young friend
had only sent him word etc

All this our breathless young MercuryOliver never walked when he
could runlearned some hours later from old Mr Stiger the cashier
who punched him in the ribs at the end of every sentence in which he
conveyed the disappointing information calling him Creeps at short
intervals and roaring with laughter at the boys account of the causes
leading up to his missing the Colonel

Gone to the club Creeps dont I tell you punch in the ribs
gone to get a little sip of Madeira and a little bit of woodcock
punch over the heart and a littleoh I tell you you young
dog this punch straight on the breastboneyou ought to be a
bank directoryou heara big fat bank director and own a big house
up in the Square if you want to enjoy yourselfand have a pretty
daughterOh you young rascal This last punch bent Oliver double
and was followed by an outburst of uncontrollable laughter from Stiger

These same punchings and outbursts had gone on since the days that
Oliver was in short trousers and Stiger was superintendent of the
Sundayschool which the boy had attended in his early yearsStiger was
still superintendent and of the same school cashiers had to have
certificates of character in those days A smoothshaven roundheaded
old fellow was Stiger with two little dabs of sidewhiskers a pair of
eyes that twinkled behind a pair of gold spectacles and a bald head
kept polished by the constant mopping of a red silk handkerchief His
costume in the bank was a black alpaca coat and high black satin stock
which grabbed him tight around the neck and held in place the two
points of his white collar struggling to be free Across his waistline
was a square of cloth This in summer replaced his waistcoat and in
winter protected it from being rubbed into holes by constant contact
with the edge of the counter

His intimacy with Oliver dated from one hot Sunday morning years
before when Oliver had broken in upon the old gentlemans long prayers
by sundry scrapings of his fingernails down the whitewashed wall of
the schoolroom producing a bloodcooling and most irreverent sound
much to the discomfort of the worshippers

Who made that noise asked Mr Stiger when the amen was reached

Me sir

What for

To get cool It makes creeps go down my back From that day the old
cashier had never called Oliver anything but Creeps

Oliver in a spirit of playful revenge made caricatures of his
prosecutor in these later years enlarging his nose puffing out his
cheeks and dressing him up in impossible clothes These sketches he
would mail to the cashier as anonymous communications always stopping
at the bank the next day to see how Stiger enjoyed them He generally
found them tacked up over the cashiers desk Some of them were still
there when Stiger died

Carried away by the warm greetings of the old cashier and the hearty
wholesouled spirit of companionship inherent in the mana spirit
always dear to Oliverhe not only stayed to make another caricature of
the old fellow over which the original laughed until the tears ran
down his fat cheeks but until all the old sketches were once more
taken from the drawer or examined on the wall and laughed at over
again Stiger praising him for his cleverness and predicting all kinds
of honors and distinctions for him when his talents become recognized
It was just the atmosphere of general approval in which our young hero
loved to bask and again the hours slipped away and three oclock came
and went and his mothers message was still undelivered Nor had he
been at Judge Ellicotts office This fact was not impressed upon him
by the moonfaced clock that hung over the cashiers desktime made no
difference to Oliverbut by the cashier himself who began stuffing
the big books into a great safe built into the wall preparatory to
locking it with a key that could have opened the gate of a walled town
and which the old gentleman took home with him every night and hung on
a nail by his bed

Thus it came to pass that another half hour had struck before Oliver
mounted the steps of the Chesapeake Club in search of the elusive
Colonel

The fat mahoganycolored porter who sat all day in the doorway of the
club dozing in his lobstershell bathchair answered his next
inquiry This ancient relic who always boasted that no gentleman
member of the club dead or alive could pass him without being
recognized listened to Olivers request with a certain lifeless aira
manner always shown to strangersand shuffled away to the readingroom
to find the Colonel

The occupant of this bathchair was not only one of the characters of
the club but one of the characters of the town He was a squat
brokenkneed old darky with white eyebrows arching over big brass
spectacles a flat nose and two keen restless monkey eyes His hands
like those of many negroes of his age were long and shrivelled the
palms wrinkled as the inside of a turkeys foot and of the same color
and texture His two feet always in evidence rested on their heels
and were generally encased in carpet slippersshoes being out of the
question owing to his lifelong habit of storing inside his own person
the drainings of the decanters an idiosyncrasy which produced a form
of gout that only carpet slippers could alleviate In his earlier life
he had carried General Washington around in his arms had waited on
Henry Clay and had been bodyservant to Lafayette besides holding the
horses of half the generals of the War of 1812at least he said so
and no man of his color dared contradict him

The years of service of this guardian of the front door dated back to
the time when the Chippendale furniture of Colonel Ralph Coston
together with many of the portraits covering the walls and the silver
chafingdishes lining the sideboard had come into the possession of
the club through that gentlemans last will and testament Coston was
the most beloved of all the epicures of his time and his famous
terrapinstewone of the marvellous delicacies of the periodhad
been cooked in these same chafingdishes The mahoganycolored Cerberus
had been Costons slave as well as butler and still belonged to the
estate It was eminently proper therefore that he should still
maintain his position at the club as long as his feet held out

While he was gone in search of the Colonel Oliver occupied himself for
a moment in examining one of the old English sporting prints that
ornamented the sidewalls of the bare uncarpeted dismal hall It was
the second time that he had entered these sacred doorsfew men of his
own age had ever done as much He had stopped there once before in
search of his father when his mother had been taken suddenly ill He
recalled again the curious spiral staircase at the end of the hall
where his father had met him and which had impressed him so at the
time He could see too the open closet out of which Mr Horn had
taken his overcoat and which was now halffilled with hats and coats

From the desolate uninviting hall Oliver passed into the large
meetingroom of the club fronting the street now filled with members
many of whom had dropped in for half an hour on their way back to their
offices Of these some of the older and more sedate men like Judge
Bowman and Mr Pancoast were playing chess others were seated about
the small tables reading sipping toddies or chatting together A few
of the younger bloods men of forty or thereabouts were standing by
the uncurtained windows watching the belles of the town in their
flounced dresses and wide leghorn hats out for an afternoon visit or
promenade Among these men Oliver recognized Howard Thom son of the
ChiefJustice poor as a church mouse and fifty years of age if a day
Oliver was not surprised to find Thom craning his neck at the window
He remembered the story they told of this perennial beauof how he had
been in love with every woman in and around Kennedy Square from Miss
Clendenning down to the latest debutante and of how he would tell you
over his first toddy that he had sown his wild oats and was about to
settle down for life and over his lastthe sixth or seventh or
eighththat the most adorable woman in town after a life devoted to
her service had thrown him over and that henceforth all that was left
to him was a load of buckshot and six feet of earth

Oliver bowed to those of the members he knew and wheeling one of the
clumsy mahogany chairs into position sat down to await the arrival of
Colonel Clayton

Meanwhile his eyes wandered over the desolate room with its
leathercovered chairs and sofas and big marble mantel bare of every
ornament but another moonfaced clocka duplicate of the one at the
bankand two bronze candelabra flanking each end and then on the
portraits of the dead and gone members which relieved the sombre
wallsone in a plumcolored coat with hair tied in a queue being no
other than his own ancestor He wondered to himself where lay the charm
and power to attract in a place so colorless and he thought as was
his habit with all interiors how different he would want it to be if
he ever became a member His fresh young nature revolted at the
dinginess and bareness of the surroundings He couldnt understand why
the men came here and what could be the fascination of sitting round
these cold tables talking by the hour when there was so much happiness
outsideso much of light and air and sunshine free to everybody

He was moreover a little constrained and uncomfortable There was
none of the welcome of Mr Crockers studio about this place nor any
of the comforting companionship of the jolly old cashier who made the
minutes fly as if they had wings and that too in a musty bank far
more uninviting even than the club He remembered his mothers message
nowand he remembered her face and the anxious expressionas we
always remember duties when we are uncomfortable He meant to hurry
home to her as soon as the Colonel dismissed him and tell her how it
had all happened and how sorry he was and what a stupid he had been
and she would forgive him as she had a hundred times before

As he sat absorbed in these thoughts his attention was attracted by a
conversation at the adjoining table between that daredevil
crosscountry rider Tom Gunning of Calvert County old General
McTavish of the Mexican War and Billy Talbot the exquisite Gunning
was in his corduroys and huntingboots He always wore them when he
came to town even when dining with his friends He had them on now
the boots being specially in evidence one being hooked over the chair
on which he sat and within a foot of Olivers elbow None of these
peculiarities however made the slightest difference in Kennedy
Square so far as Gunnings social position was concernedToms mother
having been a Carroll and his grandfather once Governor of the State

The distinguished crosscountry rider was telling General McTavish
immaculate in black wig blue coat pepperandsalt trousers and
patentleather shoes and redfaced Billy Talbot of an adventure that
he Gunning had had the night before while driving home to his
plantation The exquisites costume was in marked contrast to those of
the other twoit was his second change that day At this precise
moment he was upholstered in pegtop checkerboard trousers bobtail
Piccadilly coat and a oneinch brim straw hat all of the latest
English pattern Everything in fact that Billy possessed was English
from a rimless monocle decorating his left eye down to the animated
doormat of a skyeterrier that followed at his heels

Oliver saw from the way in which McTavish leaned over the table
protecting the tray with his two arms that he was in command of the
decanter and that the duty of alleviating the thirst of his companions
had devolved upon the General Billy Talbot sat with his hat tipped
back on his head his chin resting on his abbreviated cane his eyes
fixed on Gunning Both McTavish and Talbot were listening intently to
the crosscountry riders story

And you say you were sober Gunning Oliver heard the General ask
with a scrutinizing look at Tom Not with any humorous intentmore
with the manner of a presiding officer at a courtmartial determined
to establish certain essential facts

As a clock General The first thing I knew the mare shied and I came
pretty near landin in the dirt The lower county men always dropped
their gs He was lyin I tell you right across the road If it
hadnt been for Kitty I would have run him down I got out and held
onto the reins and there he was sir stretched out as drunk as a
lord flat on his back and sound asleep I saw right away that he was a
gentleman and I tied the mare to a tree picked him up with the
greatest care laid him on the side of the road put his hat under his
head and made him as comfortable as I could when by George sir I
hadnt any more than got back to my buggy when bang went a ball
within a foot of my head

The General who as he listened had been repointing the waxed ends of
his dyed mustache with his lemoncolored kid gloves now leaned back in
his chair

Fired at you sir The General had served both at Chapultepec and
Buena Vista and was an authority where gunpowder was concerned

Thats just what he did Came near takin the top of my head off
Hadnt been so dark he would have done it

Good God you dont tell me so exclaimed the General mopping his
lips with his perfumed handkerchief Were you armed Gunning

No sir I was entirely at his mercy and absolutely defenceless Well
I grabbed the reins to quiet the mare and then I hollered outWhat
the devil do you mean sir by tryin to blow the top of my head off
I could see now that he had raised himself up on his elbow and was
lookin at me in a way I did not like

What do you mean by disturbin my rest sir he called back

Well but my dear sir you were lyin in the middle of the road and
might have been run over

Its none of your business where I lie he hollered back I go to
sleep where I damn please sir I consider it a very great liberty

I beg your pardon sir I said I did not intend any trespass I
was walkin toward him now I did not want him to shoot again

Thats sufficient sir he said No gentleman can do more Theres
my hand sir Allow me sir to offer you a drink If you will roll me
over you will find my flask in my coattail pocket

Well I rolled him over took a drink and then I brought the mare
alongside helped him in and drove him home to my house He was a most
delightful gentleman Didnt leave my place until four oclock in the
mornin He lives about fifteen miles below me He told me his name was
Toffington Do you happen to know him Talbot said Gunning turning
to Billy

Toffington Toffington said Billy dropping his eyeglasses with a
movement of his eyebrows He had listened to the story without the
slightest comment No Tom unless he is one of those upper county
men There was a fellow I met in London last year Billy pronounced
it larst yarh to Olivers infinite amusement with some such name
as that He and I went over to Kew Gardens with the Duke of

Gunning instantly turned around with an impatient gesturenobody ever
listened to one of Billys London stories they being the neverending
jokes around Kennedy Squarefaced the General again much to Olivers
regret who would have loved above all things to hear Billy descant on
his English experiences

Do you General know anybody named Toffington asked Tom

No Gunningbut here comes Clayton he knows everybody in the State
that is worth knowing What you have told me is most
extraordinarymost extraordinary Gunning It only goes to show how
necessary it is for every man to be prepared for emergencies of this
kind You should never go unarmed sir You had a very narrow escapea
very narrow escape Gunning Here Claytoncome over here

Oliver pulled his face into long lines The picture of Gunning taking a
drink with a man who a moment before had tried to blow the top of his
head off and the serious way in which the coterie about the table
regarded the incident so excited the boys risibles that he would have
laughed outright had not his eye rested on the Colonel walking toward
him

The Colonel evidently did not hear McTavishs call His mind was
occupied with something much more important He had been finishing a
game of whist upstairs and the mahoganycolored Cerberus had not dared
to disturb him until the hand was played out The fact that young
Oliver Horn had called to see him at such an hour and in such a place
had greatly disturbed him He felt sure that something out of the
ordinary had happened

My dear boy he cried as Oliver rose to meet him I have this
instant heard you were here or I never should have kept you waiting a
moment Nothing seriousnothing at home

Oh no Colonel Only a word from mother sir I missed you at the
bank and Mr Stiger thought that I might better come here and he
delivered his mothers message in a low voice and resumed his seat
again

The Colonel now that his mind was at rest dropped into a chair
stroked his goatee with his thumb and forefinger and ran over in his
mind the sum of his engagements

Tell your dear mother he said that I will do myself the honor of
calling upon her on my way home late this afternoon Nothing will give
me greater pleasure Now stay awhile with me and let me order something
for you my boy and he beckoned to one of the browncoated servants
who had entered the room with a fresh tray for the Gunning table

No thank you Colonel I ought not to stop Oliver replied in an
apologetic way as he rose from his seat I really ought to go back
and tell mother and with a grasp of Claytons hand and a bow to one
or two men in the room who were watching his movementsthe Colonel
following him to the outer doorOliver took himself off as was the
duty of one so young and so entirely out of place among a collection of
men all so knowing and distinguished




CHAPTER VI

AMOS COBBS ADVICE


In full justice to the Chesapeake Club the scribe must admit that such
lightweights as Billy Talbot Torn Gunning and Carter Thorn did not
fairly represent the standing of the organization Many of the most
cultivated and enlightened men about Kennedy Square and the neighboring
country enjoyed its privileges among them not only such men as Richard
Horn Nathan Gill the ChiefJustice of the State and those members of
the State Legislature whose birth was above reproach but most of the
sporting gentry of the county as well as many of the more wealthy
planters who lived on the Bay and whose houses were opened to their
fellowmembers when the ducks were flying

Each mans lineage occupation and opinions on the leading topics of
the time were as well known to the club as to the man himself Any
newcorner presenting himself for membership was always subjected to
the severest scrutiny and had to be favorably passed upon by a large
majority of the committee before a sufficient number of votes could be
secured for his election

The only outsider elected for years had been Amos Cobb of Vermont the
abolitionist as he was generally called who invariably wore black
broadcloth and whose cleanshaven facea marked contrast to the
otherswith its restless black eyes strong nose and firm mouth was
as sharp and hard as the rocks of his native State His election to
full membership of the Chesapeake Club was not due to his wealth and
commercial standingneither of these would have availed himbut to
the fact that he had married a daughter of Judge Wharton of Wharton
Hall and had thus by reason of his alliance with one of the first
families of the State been admitted to all the social privileges of
Kennedy Square This exception in his favor however had never
crippled Cobbs independence nor stifled his fearlessness in expressing
his views on any one of the leading topics of the day The Vermonter
had worked with his hands when a boy on his fathers farm and believed
in the dignity of labor and the blessings of selfsupport He believed
too in the freedom of all men black and white and looked upon
slavery as a crime He expressed these sentiments openly and
unreservedly and declared that no matter how long he might live South
he would never cease to raise his voice against a system which allowed
a manas he put itto sit down in the shade and fan himself to sleep
while a lot of niggers whose bodies he owned were sweating in a
cornfield to help feed and clothe him

These sentiments it must be said did not add to his popularity
although the time had not yet arrived when he would have been thrown
into the street for uttering them

Nathan Gill was a daily visitor He was just mounting the club steps
his long penwiper cloak about his shoulders as Oliver after his
interview with Colonel Clayton passed down the street on his way back
to his mother Nathan shook hands with the Colonel and the two entered
the main room and seated themselves at one of the tables

Billy Talbot who had moved to the window and who had been watching
Oliver until he disappeared around the corner dropped his eyeglass
with that peculiar twitch of the upper lip which no one could have
imitated and crossed the room to where Nathan and Colonel Clayton had
taken their seats Waggles the scrap of a Skye terrier who was never
three feet from Billys heels instantly crossed with him After Billy
had anchored himself and had assumed his customary position with his
feet slightly apart Waggles as was his habit slid in and sat down on
his haunches between his masters gaiters There he lifted his fluffy
head and gazed about him The skill with which Mr Talbot managed his
dog was only equalled by the dexterity with which he managed his
eyeglass he never inadvertently stepped on the one nor unconsciously
let slip the other This caused Mr Talbot considerable mental strain
but as it was all to which he ever subjected himself he stood the test
bravely

Who is that young man Colonel Billy began as he bent his head to be
sure that Waggles was in position He had been abroad while Oliver was
growing up and so did not recognize him

Thats Richard Horns son the Colonel said without raising his eyes
from the paper The Colonel never took Billy seriously

And a fine young fellow he is broke in Nathan straightening himself
proudly

Hope he dont take after his father Gill By the way whats that old
wisionary doing now drawled Billy throwing back the lapels of his
coat and slapping his checked trousers with his cane Larst time you
talked to me about him he had some machine with weels and horseshoe
magnets didnt he He hasnt been in here for some time so I know
hes at work on some tomfoolery or other Amazing isnt it that a man
of his blood with a cellar of the best Madeiwa in the State should
waste his time on such things Egad I cawnt understand it Some of
Billys expressions as well as his accent came in with his clothes
Now if I had that Madeiwa do you know what Id do with it Id

Perfectly Billy cried a man at the next table who was bending over
a game of chess Youd drink it up in a week Talbot had never been
known by any other name than Billy and never would be as long as he
lived

When the laugh had subsided Nathan whose cheeks were still burning at
the slighting way in which Billy Talbot had spoken of Richard and who
had sat hunched up in his chair combing the white hair farther over his
ears with his long spare fingers a habit with him when he was in deep
thought lifted his head and remarked quietly addressing the room
rather than Talbot

Richards mind is not on his cellar hes got something to think of
besides Madeira and cards and dogs And he looked toward Waggles You
will all one day be proud to say that he lived in our town Richard
is a genius one of the most remarkable men of the day and everybody
outside of this place knows it you will be compelled to admit it yet
I left him only half an hour ago and he is just perfecting a motor
gentlemen which will

Does it go yet Nathan interrupted Cobb who was filling a glass
from a decanter which a browncoated darky had brought him Cobbs wife
was Nathans cousin and therefore he had a right to be familiar I
went to see his machine the other day but I couldnt make anything out
of it Horn is a little touched here isnt he and he tapped his
forehead and smiled knowingly

No Amos the motor was not running when I left the shop answered
Nathan dryly and with some dignity but it will be he assured me
perhaps by tomorrow He could fight Billy Talbot but he never
crossed swords with Cobb never in late years Cobb was the one man in
all the world he once told Richard with whom he had nothing in common

Oh tomorrow And Cobb whistled as he put down the decanter and
picked up the days paper It was one of Cobbs jokesthis tomorrow
of his neighbors What was a Northern mans today was always a
Southern mans tomorrow he would say I hope this young man of whom
you speak so highly is not walking in the footsteps of this genius of a
father He looks to me like a young fellow that had some stuff in him
if anybody would bring it out

The halfconcealed sneer in Cobbs voice grated also on old Judge
Bowman who threw down his book and looked up over his bowed
spectacles He was a testy old fellow with a Burgundy face and shaggy
white hair a chin and nose that met together like a parrots and an
eye like a hawk It was one of his principles to permit none of his
intimates to speak ill of his friends in his hearing Criticisms
therefore by an outsider like Cobb were especially obnoxious to him

Richard Horns head is all right Mr Cobb and so is his heart he
exclaimed in an indignant tone As for his genius sirGill is within
the mark He IS one of the remarkable men of our day You are quite
right too about his young son who has just left here He has all the
qualities that go to make a gentleman and many of those which will
make a jurist He is now studying law with my associate Judge
Ellicotta profession ennobled by his ancestors sir and one for
which what you call his stuff but which we sir call his blood
especially fits him You Northern men I know dont believe in blood
We do down here This young man comes of a line of ancestors that have
reflected great credit on our State for more than a hundred years and
he is bound to make his mark His grandfather on his mothers side was
our Chief Justice in 1810 and his greatgrandfather was

Thats just whats the matter with most of you Southerners Judge
interrupted Cobb his black eyes snapping You think more of blood
than you do of brains We rate a man on Northern soil by what he does
himself not what a bundle of bones in some family buryingground did
for him before he was born Dont you agree with me Clayton

I cant say I do Cobb replied the Colonel slowly stirring his
toddy I never set foot on your soil but once and so am unfamiliar
with your ways He never liked Cobb Hes so cursedly practical and
so proud of it too he would often say and if you will pardon me
sira trifle underbred

When was that asked Cobb looking over the top of his paper

That was some years ago when I chased a wounded canvasback across
the Susquehanna River and had to go ashore to get him and I want to
tell you sir that what you call your soil was damned disagreeable
muck I had to change my boots when I got back to my home and Ive
never worn them since And the Colonel crushed the sugar in his glass
with his spoon as savagely as if each lump were the head of an enemy
and raised the mixture to his mouth

Amoss thin lips curled The high and lofty airs of these patricians
always exasperated him The shout of laughter that followed the
Colonels reply brought the color to his cheeks

Chased him like a runaway nigger I suppose Clayton didnt you and
wrung his neck when you got him retorted Amos biting his lips

Of course like I would any other piece of my property that tried to
get away or as I would wring the neck of any man who would help him
And the Colonel looked meaningly at the Vermonter and drained his glass
with a gulp Then smothering his anger he moved away to the window
where he watched Mr Talbot who had just left the club and who at the
moment was standing on the corner making his daily afternoon inspection
of the two connecting streets an occupation which Billy varied by
saluting each newcorner with a slap of his cane on his checkerboard
trousers and a stentorian Bah Jove Waggles meanwhile squatting
pensively between his gaiters

When an hour later the Colonel presented himself at the Horn mansion
no trace of this encounter with Cobb was in his face nor in his manner
Men did not air their grievances in their own nor anyones else home
around Kennedy Square

Mrs Horn met him with her hand extended She had been watching for
Olivers return with a degree of impatience rarely seen in her She had
hoped that the Colonel would have called upon her before he went to his
office and could not understand his delay until Oliver had given his
account of the morning mishaps She was too anxious now to chide him
It was but another indication of his temperament she thoughta fault
to be corrected with the others that threatened his success in life

Holding fast to the Colonels hand she drew him to one of the old
haircloth sofas and told him the whole story

Do not give the mortgage a thought my dear Sallie the Colonel said
In his kindest manner when she had finished speaking laying his hand
on her wrist My only regret is that it should have caused you a
moments uneasiness I know that our bank has lately been in need of a
large sum of money and this loan no doubt was called in by the
board But it will be all rightif not I will provide for it myself

NoI do not want that and Richard if he knew would not be willing
either Tell me please how this money is loaned and she turned and
looked earnestly into his face What papers are passed and who signs
them I have never had anything to do with such matters and you must
explain it all clearly

A note signed by Richard and made payable on a certain date was given
to the bank and the mortgage was deposited as security

And if the note is not paid

Then the property covered by the mortgage is sold and the bank
deducts its loanany balance of course is paid over to Richard

And when the sale is put offwhat is done then

A new note is given and here the Colonel stopped as if in doubt
and sometimes a second name is placed on the note increasing the
security But Sallie dear do not let this part of it ever again
cross your mind I will attend to it should it become necessary It is
not often and the Colonel waved his hand gallantly that a Clayton
can do a Horn a service

Thank you dear friend and it is just like you to wish to do it but
this I cannot agree to I have thought of another way since you have
been talking to me Would it and she stopped and looked down on the
floor would it be of any use if I signed a note myself This house we
live in is my own as you know and would be an additional security to
the bank if anything should happen

The offer was so unusual that the Colonel caught his breath He looked
at her in astonishment but her eyes never wavered He felt instantly
that however lightly he might view the subject the matter was
intensely serious with her The Colonel half rose to his feet and with
a bow that in Kennedy Square had earned for him the title of the
Chesterfield of his time sir placed his hand on his heart

My dear Sallie he said not a member of the board could refuse It
would at once remove any obstacle the directors might have

Thank you then we will leave it so and I will have the papers
prepared at once

And is this Richards advice the Colonel ventured to ask slowly
regaining his seat There were some misgivings still lingering in his
Chesterfieldian mind as to whether the proudest man he knew gentle as
he was would not forbid the whole transaction

No He does not know of my purpose and you will please not tell him
He only knows that I am opposed to allowing the property to be sold
and he has promised me that he will take no steps in the matter without
my consent All I want you to do now is to tell him that the bank has
decided to let the matter stand This obligation hereafter will be
between me and the board and I will pledge myself to carry it out And
now one thing more before you go and I ask this because you have seen
him grow up and I know you love him What shall I do with Oliver

The Colonel again caught his breath Gallant gentleman of the old
school as he was with a profound respect for the other sex the
question startled him According to his experience and traditions the
fathers generally looked after the welfare of the sons and found them
places in lifenot the mothers

What do you want to do with him he asked quietly

I want him to go to work I am afraid this life here will ruin him

Why I thought he was studying law with Ellicott The announcement
could not have been very surprising to the Colonel He doubtless knew
how much time Oliver spent at Judge Ellicotts office

He no doubt THINKS hes studying dear friend but he really spends
half his time in old Mr Crockers studio who puts the worst possible
notions into his head and the balance of his time he is with your
Sue and she smiled faintly

For which you can hardly blame him dear lady and the Colonel bent
his head graciously

No for she is as sweet as she can be and you know I love her dearly
but they are both children and will be for some years You dont want
to support them do you and you know Richard cant and there flashed
out from her eyes one of those quizzical glances which the Colonel
remembered so well in her girlhood

The Colonel nodded his head but he did not commit himself He had
never for a moment imagined that Olivers loveaffair would go as far
as that and then again he knew Sue

What do you suggest doing with him I will help of course in any way
I can he said after a pause during which Mrs Horn sat watching
every expression that crossed his face

I dont know I have not fully made up my mind I have been greatly
disturbed over Oliver He seems to be passing through one of those
dangerous crises which often come to a boy What do you think of my
sending him to New York

THE NORTH Sallie Why you wouldnt send Oliver up North would you

The announcement this time gave the Colonel so genuine a shock that it
sent the blood tingling to his cheeks Really the idiosyncrasies of
the Horn family were beyond his comprehension Evidently Richards
vagaries had permeated his household

I do not like the influence of the North on our young men my dear
Madam The Colonel spoke now with great seriousness and with some
formality and without any of the Chesterfieldian accompaniments of
tone or gesture If he were my boy I should keep him here He is
young and lighthearted I know and loves pleasure but that will all
come out of him Let him stay with Ellicott he will bring him out all
right There is a brusqueness and a want of refinement among most
Northern men that have always grated on me You can see it any day in
Amos Cobb

As he spoke a slight flush overspread his listeners face The
positiveness of his tone she thought carried with it a certain
uncomplimentary criticism of her suggestion The Colonel saw it and
as if in apology and to prove his case added in a gentler tone Only
this afternoon at the club I heard Cobb speaking in the most outrageous
manner about our most treasured institutions It is not his fault
perhaps It is the fault of his breeding but it is unbearable all the
same Keep Oliver here He has a most engaging and lovable nature is
as clean and sweet as a girl and I havent a doubt but what he will
honor both you and his blood Take my word for it and keep him at
home He is young yet barely twentytwothere is plenty of time for
him And the Colonel rose from the sofa lifted Mrs Horns fingers to
his lips and bowed himself out

The Colonel only told the truth as he saw it In his day and
generation men of twentytwo were but boys and only graybeards ruled
the State and countinghouse The Senators were indeed grave and
reverend seigniors and the merchants in their oldfashioned
dresscoats looked more like distinguished diplomats than buyers and
sellers of produce In those days too the young man with a mustache
was thought presuming and dangerous and the bank who would have
selected a cashier under forty would have caused a run on its funds in
a week after the youth had been appointed to his position

After the Colonels departure Mrs Horn sat in deep thought The
critical tones of his voice still lingered in her memory But her
judgment had not been shaken nor was her mind satisfied Oliver still
troubled her The Colonels advice might be right but she dared not
rely upon it

The next day she sent for Amos Cobb Malachi took the message this
time not Oliver Cobb came on the minute He was greatly surprised at
Mrs Horns note for although his wife was an intimate friend of Mrs
Horns and he himself would have been welcome he was seldom present
at any of the functions of the house and could not be considered one of
its intimate guests He did not like music he said to his wife when
urged to go and as he did not play chess or drink Madeira he
preferred to stay at home

Malachi relieved Amos of his hat and conducted him into Mrs Horns
presence with rather a formal bowquite different from the low salaam
with which he had greeted Colonel Clayton Dat bobobalishnest
Mister Cobb jes gone in de parlor he said to Aunt Hannah when he
regained the kitchen Looks like he lived on parsimmons he dat sour

Mrs Horn received her visitor cordially but with a reserve which she
had not maintained toward the Colonel for Cobb had never represented
to her anything but a money standard pure and simple It was only when
the Colonel had mentioned his name and then only because of her urgent
need of just such sound practical advice as she knew he could give that
she had determined to seek his servicesquite as she would have
consulted an architect or an attorney

The Vermonter took his seat on the extreme edge of the sofa squared
his shoulders pulled up the points of his high collar touched
together the tips of all his fingers and looked straight at his
hostess

I am greatly obliged to you for coming she began for I know how
busy you are but I have a question to ask of you which I feel sure you
can answer better than anyone I know It is about my son Oliver I am
going to be perfectly frank with you and I want you to be equally
frank with me And she summed up Olivers aims temptations and
failings with a skill that gained the Vermonters closest attention
With all this she continued he is affectionate loves me dearly
and has never disobeyed me in his life It is his love of change that
worries mehis instabilityone thing one moment and another the
next It seems to me the only way to break this up is to throw him
completely on his own resources so that he may realize for once what
life really means Now tell me and she looked searchingly into
Cobbs face as if eager to note the effect of her questionif he
were your only son would you in view of all I have told you send him
to New York to make his start in life or would you keep him here

The Vermonters face had begun to lighten as she progressed and had
entirely cleared when he learned why he had been sent for He had been
afraid when he received her note that it had been about the mortgage
Cobb was chairman of the Loan Committee at the bank had personally
called attention to Richards note being overdue and had himself
ordered its payment

My two boys are at school in Vermont Madam he answered slowly

But Oliver must earn his own living she said earnestly His father
will have nothing to give him

Cobb made no reply He was not surprised Most all of these
aristocratic Southerners were on their last legs He was right about
the note he said to himselfit was just as well to have it paidand
he made a mental memorandum to inquire about it as soon as he reached
his office and have it pressed for settlement at once Business
matters must be kept intact

What do you want him to do Madam he asked looking at her keenly
from under his bushy eyebrows

Anything to earn his bread she replied in a decided tone

Cobb passed his hand over his face pinched his chin with his thumb and
forefinger and looked out of the window The answer pleased him It
pleased him too to be consulted by the Horns on a matter of this
kind It pleased him most of all to realize that when these aristocrats
who differed with him politically got into a financial hole they had to
send for him to help pull them out

For a moment the Vermonter remained in deep thought Here is a
Southern woman he said to himself with some commonsense and with a
head on her shoulders If her husband had half her brains Id let the
mortgage stand Then he turned and faced her squarely his eyes boring
into hers

Send him to New York by all means Madam or anywhere else out of
here he said firmly but with a kindly tone in his voice When you
decide let me knowI will give him a letter to a business friend of
mine who lives on the Hudson a short distance above the city who may
help him But let me advise you to send him at once I saw your son
yesterday at the club and he exactly fits your measure except in one
respect Hes got more grit in him than you give him credit for I
looked him over pretty carefully and if he gets in a tight place you
neednt worry about him Hell pull out or my name isnt Cobb And now
one thing more and he rose stiffly from the sofa and buttoned up his
coatdont give him any pocketmoney Chuck him out neck and heels
into the world and let him shift for himself Thats the way I was
treated and thats the way I got on Goodday




CHAPTER VII

A SEAT IN UNION SQUARE


Within a days journey of Kennedy Square lay another wide
breathingspace its winding paths worn smooth by countless hurrying
feet

Over its flat monotony straggled a line of gnarled willows marking the
wanderings of some guileless brook long since swallowed up and lost in
the mazes of the great city like many another young life fresh from
green fields and sunny hillsides This desert of weeds and sundried
yellow grass this kraal for scraggly trees and broken benches
breasted the rush of the great city as a stone breasts a stream
dividing its currentone part swirling around and up Broadway to the
hills and the other flowing eastward toward Harlem and the Sound
Around its four sides fronting the four streets that hemmed it in ran
a massive iron railing socketed in stone and made manproof and
dogproof by four great iron gates These gates were opened at dawn to
let the restless in and closed at night to keep the weary out

Above these barriers of stone and iron no joyous magnolias lifted their
creamy blossoms no shy climbing roses played hideandseek blushing
scarlet when caught Along its footworn paths no drowsy Moses ceased
his droning call no lovers walked forgetful of the world no staid old
gentlemen wandered idly their noses in their books

All day long on its rude straightbacked benches and over its
threadbare turf sprawled unkempt women with sick babies from the
shanties squalid noisy children from the rookeries beggars in rags
and now and then some hopeless wayfarerwho for the moment had given
up his search for work or bread and who rested or slept until the tap
of a constables club brought him to consciousness and his feet

At night before the gates were closedten oclock was the hourthere
could always be found under its dim lamps some tired girl sitting in
the light for better protection while she rested or some weary laborer
on the way home from his long days work and always passing to and
fro swinging his staff bullying the streetrats who were playing tag
among the trees and inspiring a wholesome awe among those hiding in
the shadows lounged some guardian of the peace awaiting the hour when
he could drive the inmates to the sidewalk and shut the gates behind
them with a bang

Here on one of these same straightbacked wooden seats one September
nighta night when the air was heavy with a blurred haze through
which the lamps peered as in a fog and the dust lay thick upon the
leavessat our Oliver

Outside the squareall about the iron fence and surging past the big
equestrian statue could be heard the roar and din of the great
citythat maelstrom which now seemed ready to engulf him No sound of
merry laughter reached him only rumbling of countless wheels the slow
thud of neverending crowded stages lumbering over the cobbles the
cries of the hucksters selling hot corn and the ceaseless scrapings of
a thousand feet

He had sat here since the sun had gone down watching the crowds
wondering how they lived and how they had earned their freedom from
such cares as were now oppressing him His heart was heavy A
longcoveted berth meaning selfsupport and independence and
consequent relief to his mothers heart had been almost within his
grasp It was not the place he had expected when he left home It was
much more menial and unremunerative But he had outlived all his bright
hopes He was ready now to take anything he could get to save him from
returning to Kennedy Square or what would be still worsefrom asking
his mother for a penny more than she had given him Rather than do this
he would sweep the streets

As he leaned forward on the bench his face in his hands his elbows on
his knees his thoughts went back to his fathers house He knew what
they were all doing at this hour he could see the porches crowded with
the boys and girls he loved their bright voices filling the nightair
Sue in the midst of them her curls about her face He could see his
father in the big chair reading by the lamp that dear old father who
had held his hands so tenderly and spoken with such earnestness the day
before he had left Kennedy Square

Your mother is right Richard had said I am glad you are going my
son the men at the North are broaderminded than we are here and you
will soon find your place among them Great things are ahead of us my
boy I shall not live to see them but you will

He could see his mother too sitting by the window looking out upon
the trees He knew where her thoughts lay As his mind rested on her
pale face his eyes filled with tears Dear old mother he said to
himselfI am not forgetting dear I am holding on But oh if I had
only got the place today how happy you would be tomorrow

A bitter feeling had risen in his heart when he had opened the letter
which had brought him the news of the loss of this hopedfor situation
This is making ones way in the world is it he had said to himself
with a heavy sigh Then the calm eyes of his mother had looked into his
again and he had felt the pressure of the soft hand and heard the
tones of her voice

You may have many discouragements my son and will often be ready to
faint by the way but stick to it and you will win

His bitterness had been but momentary and he had soon pulled himself
together but his every resource seemed exhausted now He had counted
so on the situationthat of a shippingclerk in a drygoods
storepromised him because of a letter that he carried from Amos
Cobbs friend But at the last moment the former clerk who had been
laid off because of sickness had been taken back and so the weary
search for work must begin again

And yet with everything against him Oliver had no thought of giving up
the struggle Even Amos Cobb would have been proud of him could he have
seen the dogged tenacity with which he clung to his purposea tenacity
due to his buoyant happy temperament or to his devotion to his
mothers wishes or and this is more than probable to some drops of
blood perhaps that had reached his own through his mothers
veinsthe blood of that Major with the blue and buff coat whose
portrait hung in the diningroom at home and who in the early days had
braved the flood at Trenton side by side with the Hero of the Bronze
Horse now overlooking the bench on which Oliver sat or it may be of
that other ancestor in the queue whose portrait hung over the mantel of
the club and who had served his State with distinction in his day

Whatever the causes of these several effects the one dominating power
which now controlled him was his veneration for his mothers name and
honor For on the night succeeding Amos Cobbs visit after she had
dropped upon her knees and poured out her heart in prayer she had gone
into Olivers bedroom and shutting the door had told him of the
mortgage of his fathers embarrassment and the danger they suffered
of losing the farmtheir only hope for their old ageunless success
crowned Richards inventions With his hand fast in hers she had given
him in exact detail all that she had done to ward off this calamity
recounting word by word what she had said to the Colonel lowering
her voice almost to a whisper as she spoke of the solemn promise she
had made himinvolving her own and her husbands honorand the
lengths to which she was prepared to go to keep her obligations to the
bank

Then her hand still clasping his the two sitting side by side on his
bed his wondering startled eyes looking into hersfor this world of
anxiety was an unknown world to himshe had by slow stages made him
realize how necessary it was that he their only son and their sole
dependence should begin at once to earn his daily bread not only on
his own account but on hers and his fathers In her tenderness she had
not told him that the real reason was his instability of purpose
fearing to wound his pride she had put it solely on the ground of his
settling down to some work

It is the law of nature my son she had added Everything that
lives must WORK to live You have only to watch the birds out here in
the Square to convince you of that Notice them tomorrow when you go
out See how busy they are see how long it takes for any one of them
to get a meal You are old enough now to begin to earn your own bread
and you must begin at once Ollie Your father can no longer help you
I had hoped your profession would do this for you but that is not to
be thought of now

Oliver at first had been stunned by it all He had never before given
the practical side of life a single thought Everything had gone along
smoothly from his earliest remembrance His fathers house had been his
home and his protection his room with its little bed and pretty
hangings and all its comfortsa room cared for like a girlshad
always been open to him He had never once asked himself how these
things came about nor why they continued These revelations of his
mothers therefore were like the sudden opening of a door covering a
vault over which he had walked unconsciously and which now for the
first time he saw yawning beneath him

Poor daddy were his first words I never knew a thing about his
troubles he seems always so happy and so gentle I am so sorrydear
daddydear dad he kept repeating

And then as she spoke there flashed into his mind the thought of his
own hopes They were shattered now He knew that the art career was
dead for him and that all his dreams in that direction were over

He was about to tell her this but he stopped before the words were
formed He would not add his own burden to her sorrow No he would
bear it alone He would tell Sue but he would not tell his mother
Next there welled up in his heart a desire to help this mother whom he
idolized and this father who represented to him all that was kind and
true

What can I do Where can I go dearie he cried with sudden resolve
Even if I am to work with my hands I am ready to do it but it must be
away from here I could not do it here at home with everybody looking
on no not here not here

This victory gained the mother with infinite tact little by little
unfolded to the son the things she had planned Finally with her arms
about his neck smoothing his cheek with her hands she told him of Amos
Cobbs advice and of his offer adding He will give you a letter to
his friend who lives at Haverstraw near New York my boy with whom you
can stay until you get the situation you want

The very impracticability of this scheme did not weigh with her She
did not see how almost hopeless would be the task of finding employment
in an unknown city Nor did the length of time her son might be a
burden on a total stranger make any difference in her plans Her own
home had always been open to the friends of her friends and for any
length of time and her inborn sense of hospitality made it impossible
for her to understand any other conditions Then again she said to
herself Mr Cobb is a thoroughly practical man and a very kind one
His friend will welcome Oliver or he would not have allowed my son to
go She had repeated however no word of the Vermonters advice to
chuck the boy out neck and heels into the world and let him shift for
himself although the very Spartan quality of the suggestion in spite
of its brusqueness had greatly pleased her She could not but
recognize that Amos understood She would have faced the situation
herself if she had been in her sons place she said so to herself And
she hoped too that Oliver would face it as bravely when the time came

As for the temptations that might assail her boy in the great city she
never gave them a thought Neither the love of drink nor the love of
play ran in her own or Richards veinsnot for generations back One
test of a gentleman my son Richard always said lies in the way in
which he controls his appetitesin the way he regards his meat and
drink Both are foods for the mind as well as for the body and must be
used as such Gluttons and drunkards should be classed together No
her boys heart might lead him astray but not his appetites and never
his passions She was as sure of that as she was of his love

As she talked on Olivers mind yielding to her stronger will as clay
does to a sculptors hand began to take shape What at first had
looked like a hardship now began to have an attractive side Perhaps
the art career need not be wholly given up Perhaps too there was a
better field for him in New York than hereold Mr Crocker had always
told him this Then too there was something of fascination after all
in going out alone like a knighterrant to conquer the world And in
that great Northern city too with its rush and whirl and all that it
held for him of mystery How many times had Mr Crocker talked to him
by the hour of its delights And Ellicotts chair Yes he could get
rid of that And Sue Sue would waitshe had promised him she would
no there was no doubt about Sue She would love him all the better if
he fought his battle alone Only the day before she had told him of the
wonderful feats of the White Knight that the new English poet had just
written about and that everybody in Kennedy Square was now reading

Above all there was the delight of another sensationthe sensation of
a new move This really pleased him best He was apparently listening
to his mother when these thoughts took possession of him for his eyes
were still fixed on hers but he heard only a word now and then It was
his imagination that swayed him now not his will nor his judgment He
would have his own adventures in the great city and see the world as
Mr Crocker had done he said to himself

Yes dearie Ill go he answered quickly Dont talk any more about
it Ill do just as you want me to and Ill go anywhere you say But
about the money for my expenses Can father give it to me he asked
suddenly a shade of anxiety crossing his face

We wont ask your father Ollie she said drawing him closer to her
She knew he would yield to her wishes and she loved him the better for
it if that were possible I have a little money saved which I will
give you You wont be long finding a good place

And how often can I come back to you he cried starting up Until
now this phase of the situation had not entered his mind

Not often my boycertainly not until you can afford it It is costly
travelling Maybe once or twice a year

Oh then theres no use talking I cant go I cantcant be away
from you that long Thats going to be the hardest part He had
started from his seat and stood over her a look of determination on
his face

Oh yes you can my son and you will she replied as she too rose
and stood beside him stopping the outburst of his weakness with her
calm voice and quieting and soothing him with the soft touch of her
hand caressing his cheek with her fingers as she had so often done
when he a baby had lain upon her breast

Then with a smile on her face she had kissed him goodnight closed
the door and staggering along the corridor steadying herself as she
walked her hand on the walls had thrown herself upon her bed in an
agony of tears crying out

Oh my boymy boy How can I give you up And I know it is forever

And now here he is footsore and heartsore sitting in Union Square
New York the roar of the great city in his ears and here he must sit
until the cattlebarge which takes him every night to the house of Amos
Cobbs friend is ready to start on her voyage up the river

He sat with his head in his hands his elbows on his knees not
stirring until a jar on the other end of the bench roused him A negro
hodcarrier splashed with plaster and wearing a ragged shirt and a
crownless straw hat had taken a seat beside him The familiarity of
the act startled Oliver No negro wayfarer would have dared so much in
his own Square at home

The man reached forward and drew closer to his own end of the bench a
bundle of sawed ends and bits of wood which he had carried across the
park on his shoulder

Oliver watched him for a moment with a feeling amounting almost to
indignation Were the poverty and the struggle of a great city to
force such familiarities upon him he wondered Then something in the
negros face as he wiped the perspiration from his forehead with the
back of his hand produced a sudden change of feeling Was this man
too without work Oliver asked himself as he felt the negros
weariness and realized for the first time the common heritage of all
men

Are you tired Uncle he asked

Yes a little mite I been atotin dis kindlin from way up yander in
Twentythird Street where the circus useter be Deys buildin a big
hotel dere nowde Fifth Avenue dey calls it Im acarryin mortar for
de bricklayers an somehow dese sticks is monstous heavy after
workin all day

Where do you live asked Oliver his eyes on the kindlingwood

Not far from here sah little way dis side de Bowry Whars yor
home And the old man rose to his feet and picked up his bundle

The question staggered Oliver He had no home really none that he
could call his ownnot now

Oh a long way from here he answered thoughtfully without raising
his head his voice choking

The old negro gazed at him for a moment touched his hat respectfully
and walked toward the gate At the entrance he wheeled about balanced
the bundle of wood on his shoulder and looked back at Oliver who had
resumed his old position his eyes on the ground Then he walked away
muttering

Pears like hes one o my own people calling me uncle Spec he aint
been long from his mammy

Two streetrats now sneaked up toward Oliver watched him for a moment
and whispered to each other One threw a stone which grazed Olivers
head the other put his hand to his mouth and yelled Spad spad at
the top of his voice Oliver understood the epithet it meant that he
wore clean linen polished shoes and perhaps now and then a pair of
gloves He had heard the same outcry in his own city for the slang of
the streetrat is Volapuk the world over But he did not resent the
assault He was too tired to chase any boys and too despondent to
answer their taunts

A constable attracted by the cries of the boys now passed in front of
him swinging his long staff He was about to tap Olivers knees with
one end of it as a gentle reminder that he had better move on when
something in the young mans face or appearance made him change his
mind

Hi sonny he cried turning quickly and facing Olivr yer cant bum
round here after ten ye know Keep yer eyes peeled for them gates
dye hear

If Oliver heard he made no reply He was in no mood to dispute the
officers right to order him about The gates were not the only
openings shut in his face he thought to himself everything seemed
closed against him in this great city It was not so at home on Kennedy
Square Its fence was a shackly mosscovered sagging old fence
intertwined with honeysuckles full of holes and minus many a paling
where he could have found a dozen places to crawl through He had done
so only a few weeks before with Sue in a mad frolic across the Square
Besides why should the constable speak to him at all He knew all
about the hour of closing the New York gates without the policeman
reminding him of it Had he not sat here every night waiting for that
cattleboat He hated the place cordially yet it was the only spot in
that great city to which he could come and not be molested while he
waited for the barges He always selected this particular bench because
it was nearest the gate that led to the bronze horse He loved to look
at its noble contour silhouetted against the sky or illumined by the
streetlamps and was seldom too tired to be inspired by it He had
never seen any work in sculpture to be compared to it and for the
first few days after his arrival he was never content to end the days
tramping until he stood beneath it following its outlines his heart
swelling with pride at the thought that one of his own nationality and
not a European had created it He wished that his father who believed
so in the talent of his countrymen could see it

Suddenly while he was still resenting the familiarity of the
constable his ears were assailed by the cry of a dog in pain some
streetrat had kicked him

Instantly Oliver was on his feet A small spaniel was running toward
him followed by half a dozen boys who were pelting him with stones

Oliver sprang forward as the dog crouched at his feet caught him up in
his arms and started for the rats who dodged behind the treetrunks
calling Spad spad as they ran Then came the voice of the same
constable

Hi yer cant bring that dog in here

Hes not my dog somebody has hurt him said Oliver in an indifferent
tone examining carefully the dogs legs to see if any bones were
broken

If that aint your dog what yer doin with him See here I been
awatchin ye Yer got ter move on or Ill run ye in Dye moind

Olivers eyes flashed In all his life no man had ever doubted his
word nor had anyone ever spoken to him in such terms

You can do as you please but I will take care of this dog no matter
what happens You ought to be ashamed of yourself to see him hurt and
not want to protect him Youre a pretty kind of an officer

A crowd began to gather

Oliver was standing with the dog under one arm holding the little
fellow close to his breast the other bent with fist tight shut as if
to defend himself

I am am I yer moonfaced spad Ill show ye and he sprang toward
Oliver

Here now Tim Murphy came a sharp voice kape yer hands off the
young gintleman He aint adoin nothin and he aint done nothin
Thim divils hit the dog I seen em myself

The officer turned quickly and faced a big broadshouldered Irish
woman bareheaded her sleeves rolled up to her elbows every line in
her kindly face replete with indignation

Dont put yer hands on him or Ill go to the lockup an tell
McManus

Oh its you is it Mrs Mulligan said the officer in a
conciliatory tone

Yes its me The young gintlemans right Its the bys ye oughter
club into shape not be foolin yer time over the dog

Well ye know its agin the rules to let dogs inside the gates he
retorted as he continued his stroll along the walk swinging his club
as he went puffing out his chest and cheeks with his old air as he
moved toward the gate

Yes an so its agin the rules she called after him to have them
rapscallions yellin like mad an howlin bloody murder when a body
comes up here to git a breath o air

Is the dog hurt sir and she stepped close to Oliver and laid her
big hand on the dogs head as it lay nestling close to Olivers side

No I dont think sohe would have been if I had not got him

The dog under the caress raised his head and a slight movement of
his tail expressed his pleasure Then his ears shot forward A young
man about Olivers own age was rapidly walking up the path with a
quick springy step whistling as he came The dog with a sudden
movement squirmed himself from under Olivers arm and sprang toward
him

Oh its you Mr Fred is it broke out the woman and its Miss
Margarets dog too Of course its her dog an I was that dumb I
didnt know it But its not me ye can thank for savin its skinits
the young gintleman here Them divils would have killed it but for him

Is the dog yours sir asked Oliver raising his hat with that
peculiar manner of his which always won him friends at first sight

No I wish it were Its Miss Margaret Grants dogone of our
students I am taking care of it while she is away The little rascal
ran out and got into the Square before I knew it I live right across
the streetyou can see my house from here Miss Grant will be ever so
much obliged to you for protecting him

Oh dont mention it I got hold of him just in time or these
ruffians would have hurt him I think the old lady here however is
most to be thanked We might both have been locked up he added
smiling if she had not interfered You know her it seems

Yes shes Mother Mulligan as we call her Shes janitress of the
Academy of Design where I draw at night My names Fred Stone Come
over to where I liveits only a step and he looked straight into
Olivers face his big blue eyes never wavering

Well I will if you dont think its too late and the two young
fellows with a wave of their hands to the old woman left the Square
the dog bounding before them

Within the hourin less time indeed for the friendly light in the
eyes of his newfound friend had shone straight into our boys soul
warming and cheering him to his fingertips opening his heart and
bringing out all his secretsOliver had told Fred the story of his
fruitless tramps for work of his mothers hopes and fears of his own
ambitions and his aims And Fred his own heart wide open had told
Oliver with equal frankness the story of his own struggles of his
leaving his fathers farm in the western part of the State and of his
giving up everything to come to New York to study art

It was the old old story of two chance acquaintances made friends by
reason of the common ground of struggle and privation on which they
stood comrades fighting side by side in the same trenches for the same
end and both dreaming of the morrow which would always bring victory
and never death A story told without reserve for the disappointments
of life had not yet dulled their enthusiasm nor had the caution
acquired by its many bitter experiences yet checked the free flow of
their confidences

To Oliver in his present despondent mood the hand held out to him was
more than the hand of a comrade It was the hand of a strong swimmer
thrust into the sea to save a drowning man There were others then
besides himself he thought as he grasped it who were making this
fight for bread and glory there was something else in the great city
besides cruelty and misery moneygetting and moneyspendingsomething
of unselfishness sympathy and love

The two sat on the steps of Freds boardinghousethat house where
Oliver was to spend so many happy days of his afterlifeuntil there
was only time enough to catch the barge Reluctantly he bade his
newfound comrade goodby and waving his hand turned the corner in
the direction of the dock

The edge of Olivers cloud had at last caught the light




CHAPTER VIII

AN OLD SONG


Not only had the sunshine of a new friendship illumined the edge of
Olivers clouds but before the week was out a big breeze laden with
success had swept them so far out to sea that none but the clearest of
skies radiant with hope now arched above his happy face

A pasteboard sign had wrought this miracle

One day he had been tramping the lower parts of the city down among
the docks near Coenties Slip looking up the people who on former
visits had said Some other time perhaps or If we should have room
for another man we will be glad to remember you or We know Mr Cobb
and shall be pleased etc etc when he chanced to espy a strange
sign tacked outside a warehouse door a sign which bore the
unheardofannouncementunheard of to Oliver especially the last
word Shipping Clerk WANTED

No one for weeks had WANTED anything that Oliver could furnish
Strangely enough too as he afterward discovered the bulletheaded
Dutch porter had driven the last tack into the clean white welcome
face of the sign only five minutes before Oliver stopped in front of
it Still more out of the common and still more incomprehensible was
the reply made to him by the head salesman whom he found just inside
the doora wiry restless little man with two keen black eyes and a
perfectly bald head

Yes if you can mark boxes decently can show any references dont
want too much pay and can come NOW Were short of a boy and its our
busy season

Oh blessed be Mr Crocker thought Oliver as he picked up a
markingbrush stirred it round and round in the tin pot filled with
lampblack and turpentine and to his own and the clerks delight
painted on a clean board rapidly and clearly and in new letters
toonew to the clerkthe full address of the baldheaded mans
employers

 MORTON SLADE  CO
 121 PEARL STREET NEW YORK

More amazing still were the announcements made by the same baldheaded
man after Oliver had shown him Amos Cobbs recommendations Oliver was
to come to work in the morning the situation to be permanent provided
Cobb confirmed by letter the good wishes he had previously expressed
and provided Mr Morton the senior partner approved of the
baldheads action of which the animated billiardball said there was
not the slightest doubt as he the ball had charge of the shipping
department and was responsible for its efficiency

All of these astounding incomprehensible and amazing occurrences
Oliver had written to his mother ending his letter by declaring in his
enthusiasm that it was his art after all which had pulled him
through and that but for his readiness with the brush he would still
be a tramp instead of rolling in luxury on the huge sum of eight
dollars a week with every probability of becoming a partner in the
house and later on a millionnaire To which the dear lady had
replied that she was delighted to know he had pleased his employers
but that what had pleased her most was his never having lost heart
while trying to win his first fight adding The second victory will
come more easily my darling boy and so will each one hereafter Poor
lady she never knew how sore that boys feet had been nor how many
times he had gone with half a meal or none at all for fear of
depleting too much the small store she had given him when he left home

With his success still upon him he had sallied forth to call upon
young Fred Stone who had grasped his hand so warmly the night he had
rescued the dog from the streetboys and whose sympathy had gone out
to him so freely He had written him of his good fortune and Fred had
replied begging him to call upon him and had appointed this same
Friday night as the night of all others when he could entertain him
best

But Oliver is not the same boy who said goodby to Fred that moonlight
night the week before His eyes are brighter his face is aglow with
illconcealed pleasure Even his step shows the oldtime spring and
lightness of the days at homeon his toes part of the time as if
restraining an almost uncontrollable impulse to stop and throw one or
two handsprings just to relieve the pressure on his nerves

When he reached the bench in the Square where he had sat so many nights
with his head in his hands one of those quick outbursts of enthusiasm
took possession of him the kind that sets young hearts singing with
joy when some sudden shift of hopes kaleidoscope opens a wide horizon
brilliant with the light of future success With an exclamation of
boyish glee he plumped himself down upon the hard planks of the bench
and jumped up again pirouetting on his toe and slanting his hat over
one eye as if in a spirit of sheer bravado against fate Then he
sauntered out of the iron gate to Freds house

Even as he waited on the stone steps of Miss Teeturns boardinghouse
for the dowdy servantgirls returnsuch dirty unkempt steps as they
were and such a dingy doorplate spotted with rain and dust not like
Malachis he thoughthe could hardly restrain himself from beating
Juba with his foot a plantation trick Malachi had taught him keeping
time the while with the palms of his hands on his shapely legs

Meanwhile another young enthusiast is coming downstairs three steps at
a time this one bareheaded all out of breath and without a coat
who pours out his heart to the first Jubabeating enthusiast as the two
climb the stairs together to the second enthusiasts room on the very
top floor He tells him of his delight at seeing him again and of the
lot of fellows waiting to welcome him under the skylight and of what a
jolly lot the Skylarkers really are and of Mr Slade Olivers
employer whom Fred knows and who comes from Freds own town and of
how much Mr Slade likes a certain new clerk one Oliver Horn of
Kennedy Square he having said so the night before this same Horn
being the precise individual whose arm at that very moment was locked
in Freds own and which was now getting an extra squeeze merely for the
purposes of identification

All of this Fred poured into Olivers willing ear without stopping to
take breath as they mounted the four long flights of stairs that led
to the top floor where under the roof there lived a group of
Bohemians as unique in their personalities as could be found the great
city over

When the two pairs of feet had at last reached the last flight of steps
under the flat roof of the house the Skylarkers were singing Old
Dog Tray at the top of their voices to the accompaniment of a piano
and of some other instruments the character of which our young hero
failed to recognize although the strains had grown louder and louder
as the young men mounted the stairs

As Oliver stood in the open doorway and looked in through the haze of
tobaccosmoke upon the group he instantly became conscious that a new
world had opened before him a world as he had always pictured it
full of mystery and charm peopled by a race as fascinating to him as
any Mr Crocker had ever described and as new and strange as if its
members had been the denizens of another planet

The interior was not a room but a square lowceiled hall into which
opened some six or more small bedrooms slept in whenever sleep was
possible by an equal number of Miss Teetums boarders The
construction and appointments of this open garret with two exceptions
were similar to those of all other garrets of its class it had walls
and ceiling once whitewashed and now discolored by roofleaks from a
weatherbeaten skylight its floor was bare of carpet and its
wellworn woodwork was stained with time and use Chairs however were
scarce most of the boarders and their guests being seated on the floor

The two exceptions already noted were some crisp telling sketches
big and little in color and blackandwhite the work of the artist
members of this coterie which covered every square inch of the
leakstained surface of ceiling and wall and the yellowkeyed
battered piano which occupied the centre of the open space and which
stood immediately under two flaring gasjets At the moment of Freds
and Olivers arrival the top of this instrument was ornamented by two
musically inclined gentlemen one seated crosslegged like a Turk
voicing the misfortunes of Dog Tray the other with his legs resting
on a chair beating time to the melody with a cane This cane at short
intervals he brought down upon the shoulders of any ambitious member
who attempted to usurp his place The chief object of the gathering so
far as Olivers hasty glance could determine was undoubtedly the
making of as much noise as possible

While the young men stood looking into the room waiting for the song to
cease prior to Olivers entry and introduction Fred whispered
hurriedly into his guests ear some of the names occupations and
characteristics of the group before him

The crosslegged man with the long neck drooping mustache and ropy
black hair was none other than Bowdoin the artistthe only American
who had taken a medal at Munich for landscape but who was now painting
portraits and starving slowly in consequence He mounted to this eyry
every Friday night so as to be reminded of the good old days at
Schwartzs The short bigmustached baldheaded man swinging the
cane was BianchiJulius Bianchiknown to the Skylarkers as The
Pole and to the world at large as an accomplished lithographer and
maker of mezzotints Bianchi was a piece of the early artistic
driftwood cast upon our shoresan artist every inch of himdrawing
from life and handling the crayon like a master

The palefaced young fellow at the piano with bulging watchcrystal
eyeglasses and hair tucked behind his ears was the wellknown
allround musician Wenby Simmonsotherwise known as Pussy Meowa
name associated in some way with the strings of his violin This
virtuoso played in the orchestra at the Winter Garden and occupied the
bedroom next to Freds

The cleanshaven wellgroomed young Englishman standing behind Simmons
and holding a coalscuttle half full of coal which he shook with
deafening jangle to help swell the chorus was My Lord Cockburn so
calledan exchange clerk in a bankinghouse He occupied the room
opposite Freds

With the ending of the chorus Fred Stone stepped into the open space
with his arm through that of his guest and the noise was hushed long
enough for the entire party to welcome the young Southernera welcome
which kindled into a glow of enthusiasm when they caught the look of
frank undisguised pleasure which lighted his face and noticed the
unaffected bow with which he entered the room shaking hands with each
one as Fred introduced himand all with that warm hearty simple
courteous manner peculiar to his people

The slight ceremony overalmost every Friday night some new guest was
welcomedFred seated himself on the floor with his back to the
whitewashed wall although two chairs were at once offered them and
made room for Oliver who settled down beside him

As they sat leaning back Olivers eyes wandering over the room
drinking in the strange fascinating scene before him as bewildering
as it was unexpected Frednow that they were closer to the scene of
action again whispered or shouted as the suddenly revived noise
permitted into Olivers alert and delighted ears such additional
facts concerning the other members present as he thought would interest
his guest

The fat man behind the piano astride of a chair a pipe in his mouth
and a black velvet skullcap on his head was Tom Waller the
sheeppainterThomas Brandon Waller he signed itknown as the Walrus
He too was a boarder and a delightful fellow although an habitual
grumbler His highest ambition was to affix an N A at the end of his
name but he had failed of election by thirty votes out of forty cast
That exasperating event he had duly celebrated at Pfaffs in various
continued libations covering a week and had accordingly on many
proper and improper occasions renewed and recelebrated the event
breathing out meanwhile between his pewter mugs scathing anathemas
against the idiots who had defeated him out of his just rights and
who were stupid enough to believe in the school of Verboeckhoeven
Slick and shiny Verboeckhoeven the mechanic he would call him with
his fists closed tight who painted the hair on every one of his sheep
as if it were curled by a pair of barbers tongsnot dirty and woolly
and full of suggestions as of course hethe great Waller alone of
all living animalpaintersdepicted it All of which to Wallers
credit it must be parenthetically stated these same idiots learned
to recognize in after years as true when that distinguished
animalpainter took a medal at the Salon for the same picture which the
Jury of N As had rejected at their Spring Exhibition

The irreproachable immaculate young person with eyes halfclosed
lying back in the armchairone which he had brought from his own
roomwas Ruffleshirt Tomlins He was the only member who dressed
every day for dinner whether he was going out afterward or
notspiketailed coat white tie and all Tomlins not only knew
intimately a lady of high degree who owned a box at the Academy of
Music in Fourteenth Street and who invited him to sit in it at least
once a season but he had besides a large visiting acquaintance among
the people of quality living on Irving Place A very agreeable and
kindly little man was Ruffleshirt Tomlinsso Fred saidthe sort of
a little man whose philosophy of life was based on the possibility of
catching more innocent unwary flies with honey than he could with
vinegar and who in consequence always said nice things about
everybodysometimes in a loud tone enough for everybody to hear This
last statement of Freds Tomlins confirmed ten minutes later by
remarking in a stage whisper to Waller

Did you see how that young Mr Horn entered the room Nobody like
these highbred Southerners my boy Quite the air of a man of the
worldhasnt he To all of which the distinguished sheeppainter made
no other reply than a slight nod of the head as he blew a cloud of
smoke toward the ceilingTomlinss immaculate appearance being a
constant offence to the untidy painter

The member with the stentorian voice who was roaring out his opinions
to Cockburn Fred continued was Foghorn Cranch the auctioneer His
room was next to Wallers His weaknesses were gaycolored waistcoats
and astounding cravats He varied these portions of his dress according
to wind weather and sales of the dayselecting blue for sunshiny
mornings black for rainy ones green for pictures red for household
furniture white for real estate etc Into these colorschemes he
stuck a variety of scarfpinsnone very valuable or rare but each one
distincta miniature ivory skull for instance with little garnets
for eyes or tiny onyx dice with sixes on all sides

The one man of all the others most beloved by Fred and every other
boarder guest and habitue that gathered around the piano in this
garretroom and now conspicuous by his absence he having gone to the
circus opposite the Academy of Music and not likely to return until
latea fact greatly regretted by Fred who made this announcement with
lowered voice to Oliverwas a young Irishman by the name of
McFuddCornelius McFudd the life of the house and whom Waller in
accordance with the general custom had christened Continuous
McFuddie by reason of the nature of the Hibernians habits His room
was across the open space opposite Freds with windows overlooking the
yard

This condensation of goodnature wit and goodhumor Fred went on to
say had been shipped to The States by his father a rich
manufacturer of Irish whiskies in Dublin that he might learn something
of the ways of the New World And there was not the slightest doubt in
the minds of his comrades so Fred assured Oliver that he had not only
won his diploma but that the sum of his knowledge along several other
lines far exceeded that of any one of his contemporaries His
allowances came regularly every month through the hands of Cockburn
who had known him in London and whose bank cashed McFudds
remittancesa fact which enabled my lord to a greater extent than the
others to keep an eye on the Irishmans movements and expenditures

Whatever deviltry was inaugurated on this top floor during the day as
well as the night and it was pretty constant could be traced without
much difficulty to this irrepressible young Irishman If Tomlins found
his dresssuit put to bed with a pillow for a body and his crushhat
for a head or Cranch found Wallers layfigure Waller often used his
bedroom as a studio sitting bolt upright in his easychair with its
back to him reading a newspaperthe servant having been told to
announce to Cranch the moment she opened the door that a gentleman
was waiting for him in his room or Cockburn was sent off on some
wildgoose chase uptownit was safe to say that Mac was at the bottom
of it all

If Fred added impressively this rollicking devilmaycare perfectly
sound and hearty young Hibernian had ever been absolutely entirely
and completely sober since his sojourn in the land of the free no one
of his fellowboarders had ever discovered it

Of this motley gathering Ruffleshirt Tomlins the swell Foghorn
Cranch the auctioneer Walrus Waller the sheeppainter My Lord
Cockburn the Englishman Fred Stone and Cornelius McFudd not only
occupied the bedrooms but had seats at Miss Teetums table four
flights below Bianchi and the others were the guests of the evening

All this and more Fred poured into Olivers willing ear in loud or
soft tones dependent upon the particular kind of bedlam that was loose
in the room at the moment as they sat side by side on the floor
Olivers back supported by a pillow which Tomlins had brought from his
own bed and tucked behind his shoulders with his own hand

This courtesy had been followed by another quite as comforting and as
thoughtful Cockburn the moment Olivers back touched the wall had
handed him a toothbrush mug without a handle filled to the brim with
a decoction of Cockburns own brewing compounded hot according to
McFudds receipt and poured from an earthen pitcher kept within reach
of Cockburns hand and to which Oliver in accordance with his
habitual custom had merely touched his lips he being the most
temperate of young gentlemen

While they talked on stopping now and then to listen to some outburst
of Cranch whose voice drowned all othersor to snatches of song from
Wenby Simmons the musician or from Julius Bianchi Wallers voice
managed to make itself felt above the din with an earnestness that
gained the attention and calmed all the others

You dont know what youre all talking about he was heard to say He
was still astride his chair his pipe in his hand Innesss picture
was the best thing we had in the Exhibition except Eastman Johnsons
Negro Life at the South Kensetts Lake George was

Whatthat Inness smear retorted My Lord Cockburn who still stood
with the coalscuttle in his hand ready for another chorus
Positively Waller you Americans amuse me Do you really think that
youve got anybody about you who can paint anything worth having

Oh oh Hear the highcockalorum Oh oh

The sheeppainter raised his hand to command silence

Do I think weve got anybody about here who can paintyou fogheaded
noodle from Piccadilly Weve got a dozen young fellows in this very
town that put more real stuff into their canvases than all your men put
together They dont tickle their things to death with detail They get
air and vitality and outofdoors into their work and

Names Names shouted My Lord Cockburn rattling the scuttle to
drown the answers to his questions

George Inness for one and young McEntee and Sanford Gifford and
Eastman Johnson Page Casileara lot of them shouted The Walrus
Go to the Exhibition and see for yourself and you

The rest of the discussion was lost to Olivers ears owing to the roar
of Cranchs foghorn accompanied by another vigorous shaking of the
scuttle which the auctioneer caught away from My Lord Cockburns
grasp and the pounding of Simmonss fingers on the yellow keys of the
wheezy piano

The tribute to Inness had not been missed by Oliver despite the
deafening noise accompanying its utterance He remembered another green
smear that hung in Mr Crockers studio to which that old enthusiast
always pointed as the work of a man who would yet be heard from if he
lived He had never appreciated it himself at the time but now he saw
that Mr Crocker must be right

Someone now started the chorus

Down among the dead men down

Instantly every man was on his feet crowding about the piano Oliver
catching the inspiration of the moment and joining in with the others
The quality of his voice must have caught the ear of some of the
singers for they gradually lowered their tones leaving Olivers voice
almost alone

Freds eye glowed with pleasure His newfound friend was making a
favorable impression He at once urged Oliver to sing one of his own
Southern songs as the darkies sung them at home and not as they were
caricatured by the end men in the minstrel shows

Oliver at first abashed and then anxious to contribute something of
his own in return for all the pleasure they had given him hummed the
tune for Simmons and in the hush that followed began one of the old
plantation songs that Malachi had taught him beginning with

 De old black dog he bay at de moon
 Away down yan ribber
 Miss Bullfrog say she git dar soon
 Away down yan ribber

As the melody rang through the room now full and strong now plaintive
as the cooing of a dove or the moan of a whippoorwill the men stood
stockstill their wondering eyes fixed on the singer and it was not
until the timely arrival of the Bullfrog and the escape of her lover
had been fully told that the listening crowd allowed themselves to do
much more than breathe Then there came a shout that nearly raised the
roof The peculiar sweetness of Olivers voice the quaintness of the
melody the grotesqueness of his gesturesfor it was pantomime as well
as musicand the quiet simplicity and earnestness with which it had
all been done had captivated every man in the room It was Olivers
first triumphthe first in all his life

And the second was not far off for in the midst of all the uproar that
followed as he resumed his place on the floor Cockburn sprang to his
feet and proposed Mr Oliver Horn as a full member of the Skylarkers
Club This was carried unanimously and a committee of two consisting
of Ruffleshirt Tomlins and Waller were forthwith appointed to
acquaint the said member who stood three feet away of his election
and to escort him to Tomlinss chairthe largest and most
imposinglooking one in the room This action was indorsed by the
shouts and catcalls of all present accompanied by earthquake shakings
of the coalscuttle and the rattling of chairlegs and canes on the
floor

Oliver rose to his feet and stood blushing like a girl thanking those
about him in halting sentences for the honor conferred upon him Then
he stammered something about his not deserving their praise for he
could really sing very few songsonly those he had sung at home to
help out an occasional chorus and that he would be delighted to join
in another song if any one of the gentlemen present would start the
tune

These last suggestions being eminently distasteful to the group were
immediately drowned in a series of protests the noise only ceasing
when Foghorn Cranch mounted a chair and in his best real estate
voice commanded silence

Ladies and Gentlemen thundered the auctioneer I have the honor to
announce that the great barytone Mr Oliver Horn known to the
universe as the Musical Cornucopia late of the sunny South and now
a resident of this metropolis will delight this company by singing one
of those soulmoving plantation melodies which have made his name
famous over two hemispheres Mr Pussy Meow Simmons the
distinguished fiddling pianist late of the Bowery very late I may
remark and now on the waiting list at Wallacks Theatreevery other
month I am toldwill accompany him

Hear Hear Horn Horn Dont let him get away Fred Song
Song was heard all over the room

Oliver again tried to protest but he was again shouted down by cries
of

None of that Cant fool us You know a barrel of em Song
Song

Cranch broke in againMr Horns modesty gentlemen greatly endears
him to his fellowmembers and we love him the better for it but all
the same and he raised his hand with the same gesture he would have
used had it held an auctioneers hammerAll in favor of his singing
again say Aye Going Going Gone The ayes have it In the midst of
the cheering Cranch jumped from the chair and taking Oliver by the hand
as if he had been a young prima donna at her first appearance led him
to the piano with all the airs and graces common to such an occasion

Our young hero hesitated a moment looked about in a pleased but
helpless way and nerving himself tried to collect his thoughts
sufficiently to recall some one of the songs that were so familiar to
him at home Then Sues black eyes looked into histhere must always
be a woman helping Oliverand the strains of the last song he had sung
with her the night before he left home floated through his brain
These same eyes were gazing into anothers at the moment but our
young Oliver was unconscious of that lamentable fact

Did you ever happen to hear The Old Kentucky Home Oliver asked
Simmons No Well it goes this way and he struck the chords

You play it said Simmons rising from the stool

Oh I can only play the chords and not all of them right and he
took Simmonss seat Perhaps I can get throughIll try it he
added simply and squared himself before the instrument and began the
melody

The sun shines bright in the old Kentucky home Tis summer the
darkies are gay The corntops ripe and the meadow is in bloom While
the birds make music all the day

Weep no more my ladyoh weep no more today Well sing one song for
the old Kentucky home For the old Kentucky home far away

As the words rolled from his lips Oliver seemed to forget the scene
before him Somehow he could see the light in Sues eyes as she
listened and hear her last words He could hear the voice of his
mother and feel her hand on his head and then as the soft vowels and
cadences of the quaint melody breathed themselves out he could catch
again the expression of delight on the face of Malachiwho had taught
him the songas he listened his black cheek in his wrinkled palm It
was a supreme moment with Oliver The thrill of happiness that had
quivered through him for days intensified by this new heaven of
Bohemia vibrated in every note he uttered

The effect was equally startling on those about him Cranch craned his
head and for once lowered his voice to a whisper in speaking to the
man next him Bowdoin the painter and one of the guests left his
seat and tiptoed to the piano his eyes riveted on Olivers face his
whole being absorbed in the melody Bianchi and Waller so far lost
themselves that their pipes went out while Simmons was so entranced
that he forgot to applaud when Oliver finished

The effect produced was not so much due to the quality in Olivers
voicesweet and sympathetic as it wasnor to his manner of singing
nor to the sentiment of the song itself but to the fact of its being
with its clear sweet notes a positive contrast to all of noise and
clamor that had gone before This fact more than any other made his
listeners hold their breath in wonder and delight It came like the
song of a bird bursting out after a storm and charming everyone with
the beauty of its melody while the thunder of the tempest still
reverberated through the air

In the hush of the deathlike stillness that followed the steady tramp
of feet was heard on the staircase and the next instant the head of a
young man with a rosy face and sidechop coachman whiskers closecut
black hair and shoebutton eyes glistening with fun was craned around
the jamb of the door

It was the property of Mr Cornelius McFudd

He was in full evening dress and as immaculate as if he had stepped
out of a bandbox

Whatever stimulants had permeated his system and fired his imagination
had evidently escaped his legs for they were as steady as those of a
tripod His entrance in a measure restored the assemblage to its
normal condition Mr McFudd raised his hand impressively checking the
customary outbreak that always greeted his appearance on occasions like
this struck a deprecatory attitude and said solemnly in a rich
NorthofIreland accent

Gentlemen it is with the greatest surprise that I find ye contint to
waste your time over such riotous proceedings as I know have taken
place here tonight when within a block of yez is a perfarmance that
would delight yer souls Think of a man throwing a handspring over

At this instant a wet sponge was fired point blank from an open bedroom
door missed McFudds head by an inch and bounded down the staircase

Thank ye Admiral Lord Cockburn for yer civility cried McFudd
bowing low to the open bedroom door and for yer good intintions but
ye missed it as yer did yer mithers blessingand as ye do most of the
things ye try to hit This was said without raising his voice or
changing a muscle of his face his eyes fixed on the door inside of
which stood Cockburn

McFudd continued The perfarmance of this acrobat is one of the

Cries of Dont you see you disturb the music Go to bed Somebody
sit on McFudd etc filled the room

Go on gentlemen Continue your insults defame the name of an honest
man who is attimpting to convey to yer dull comprehinsions some idea of
the wonders of the acrobatic ring Ill turn a handspring for yez
meself that will illustrate what I mane and Mr McFudd carefully
removed his coat and began sliding up his shirtcuffs

At this juncture My Lord Cockburn who had come from behind the door
winked significantly at Waller and creeping on all fours behind
McFudd just as that gentleman was about lifting his legs aloft swept
him off his feet by a twist of his arm and deposited him on the small
of his back next to Oliver his head resting against the wall There
Waller stood over him with a chair which he threatened to turn over
him upside down and sit on if the prostrate Irishman moved an inch

McFudd waved his hand sadly as if in acquiescence to the inscrutable
laws of fate begged the gentlemen present to give no further thought
to his existence and after a moment of silence continued his remarks
on the acrobatic ring to Oliver in the same monotonous tone of voice
which he had addressed to the room before Cockburns flank movement had
made him bite the dust

It may seem to you Mr Mr I havent your name sir and he
bent his head toward Oliver

Horn sir Oliver suggested Oliver Horn

Thanks it may seem to you that Im exaggerating Mr Oliver Horn the
wonder of this perfarmance but

The rest of the sentence despite the Hibernians wellintentioned
efforts was not addressed to Oliver but to the room at large or
rather to its furniture or to be still more exact to the legs of the
piano and such chairs and tables as the Irishmans prostrate body
bumped into on the way to his room For at that instant Waller to save
Oliver as he pretended from further annoyance had caught the
distinguished Hibernian by both feet and in that position dragged him
along the floor as if he had been a wheelbarrow McFudds voice never
changing its tone as he continued his remarks on physical culture and
the benefits which would accrue to the human race if they would
practice the acrobats handspring

When Fred and Oliver had closed their bedroom door for the night the
guests having departed and all the regular boarders being supposedly
secure in their beds Fred without much difficulty had persuaded Oliver
to share his own bed over night there came a knock at Freds door
and the irrepressible Irishman stalked in

He had removed his vest high collar and shoes and had the air and
look of an athlete The marvellous skill of the acrobat still occupied
his mind

Dont disturb yourself my dear Stone but me deloightful conversation
with yer friend Mr Horn was interrupted by that wild beast of a
Waller and I wanted to finish it I am quite sure I can do itthe
trick I was telling ye of Ive been practizing in me room Its as
easy as rolling off a jaunting car

No Mac old man Go to bed again pleaded Fred

Not till I show ye me boy one of the most beautiful feats of
agility

Come off Mac I say cried Fred catching the Irishman around the
waist

Ill come nothing Unhand me gentlemen or by the and tearing
himself free McFudd threw a handspring with the ease of a
professional toppled for a moment his feet in the air scraped along
the whitewashed wall with his heels and sweeping the basins and
pitchers filled with water from the washstand measured his length on
the floor Then came the crash of broken china a deluge of water and
Fred and Oliver began catching up sponges and towels to stay the flood

A minute later a man in a long gray beard and longer nightrobeone of
the regular boardersbounded up the stairs two steps at a time and
dashed through Freds open door

By thunder boys he cried I dont mind how much noise you make
rather like it but what the devil are you trying to drown us out for
Wife is soakingits puddling down on our bed

By this time every door had been flung open and the room was filled
with halfdressed men

Its that lunatic McFudd Hes been to the circus and thinks hes
Martello cried Fred pointing to the prostrate Irishman with the
sponge which he had been squeezing out in the coalscuttle

Or the clown remarked Waller stooping over McFudd who was now
holding his sides and roaring with laughter

Long after Fred had fallen asleep Oliver lay awake thinking of the
nights pleasure He had been very very happyhappier than he had
been for many months The shouts of approval on his election to
membership the rounds of applause that had followed his rendering of
the simple negro melodies resounded in his ears and the joy of it all
still tingled through his veins This first triumph of his life had
brought with it a certain confidence in himselfa new feeling of
selfrelianceof being able to hold his own among men something he
had never experienced before This made it all the more exhilarating

And the company

Real live painters who sold their pictures and who had studied in
Munich and who knew Paris and Dresden and all the wonderful cities of
which Mr Crocker had talked And real musicians toowho played at
theatres and Englishmen from London and Irishmen from Dublin and all
so jolly and unconventional and companionable It was just as Mr
Crocker had described it and just what he had about despaired of ever
finding Surely his cup of happiness was full to the brim

We can forgive him we who still remember those glimpses behind the
scenesour first and nevertobeforgotten How real everything
seemed even the greasepaint the wigs and the clothes And the
walking gentleman and the leading old man and low comedian What
splendid fellows they were and how we sympathized with them in their
enforced exiles from a beloved land How they suffered from scheming
brothers who had robbed them of their titles and estates or
flinthearted fathers who had turned them out of doors because of their
infatuation for their art or because of their love for some dame of
noble birth or simple lass whose nameMe boy will be forever
sacred How proud we were of knowing them and how delighted they were
at knowing usand they so much older too And how tired we got of it
alland of themand of all their kind when our eyes became accustomed
to the glare and we saw how cheap and commonplace it all was and how
much of its glamour and charm had come from our own inexperience and
enthusiasmand youth

As Oliver lay with wideopen eyes going over every incident of the
evening he remembered with a certain touch of exultant pride a story
his father had told him of the great Poe and he fell to wondering
whether the sweetness of his own song falling on ears stunned by the
jangle of the night had not produced a similar effect Poe his father
had said on being pressed for a story in the midst of a night of
revelry in a famous house on Kennedy Square had risen from his seat
and repeated the Lords Prayer with such power and solemnity that the
guests one and all stunned and sobered had pushed their chairs from
the table and had left the house He remembered just where his father
sat when he told the story and the impression it had made upon him at
the time He wished Kennedy Square had been present tonight to have
heard him and to have seen the impression his song had made upon those
gathered about him

Kennedy Square What would dear old Richard Horn with his violin
tucked lovingly under his chin and gentle whitehaired Nathan with
his lips caressing his flute have thought of it all as they listened
to the uproar of Cockburns coalscuttle And that latterday
Chesterfield Colonel John Howard Clayton of Pongateague whose
pipestemmed Madeira glasses were kept submerged in iced fingerbowls
until the moment of their use and whose rare Burgundies were drunk out
of rubycolored soapbubbles warmed to an exact temperature What would
this old aristocrat have thought of McFudds mixture and the way it was
served

No It was just as well that Kennedy Square at the moment of Olivers
triumph was fast asleep




CHAPTER IX

MISS TEETUMS LONG TABLE


The prying sun peeped through the dingy curtains of Freds bedroom on
the morning after Olivers revels stencilling a long slant of yellow
light down its grimy walls and awaking our young hero with a start
Except for the shattered remnants of the basins and pitchers that he
saw as he looked around him and the stringy towels still wet hanging
over the backs of the chairs he would not have recognized it as the
same room in which he had met such brilliant company the night
beforeso kindly a glamour does the night throw over our follies

With the vision of the room and its tokens of their frolic came an
uneasy sense of an unpleasant remembrance The thrill of his own
triumph no longer filled his heart only the memory of the uproar
remained As he caught sight of the broken pieces of china still
littering the carpet and recalled McFudds sprawling figure a slight
color suffused his cheek

The room itself in the light of day was not only cold and uninviting
but so bare of even the commonest comforts that Oliver shivered The
bottoms were half out of the chairs the painted washstand stood on a
square of chilly oilcloth the rusty grate and broken hearth were
unswept of their ashes the carpet patched and threadbare He wondered
as he studied each detail how Miss Teetum could expect her boarders to
be contented in such quarters

He saw at a glance how much more cosey and restful the room might be
made with the addition of a few touches here and there a colored print
or twoa plaster casta bit of cheap stuff or some gaycolored
cushions It surprised him above all to discover that Fred who was
studying art and should therefore be sensitive to such influences
was willing to live amid such desolate surroundings

When he stepped out into the square hall the scene of the nights
revelry and glanced about him the crude bareness and reckless
disorder that the merciful glow of the gaslight and its attendant
shadows had kindly concealed stood out in bold relief under the white
light of the day now streaming through an oval skylight immediately
above the piano The floor was strewn with the various properties of
the nights performanceoverturned stools china mugs bits of
lemonpeel stumps of cigars and stray pipes while scattered about
under the piano and between the legs of the chairs and even upon the
steps of the staircase were the pieces of coal which Foghorn Cranch
and Waller who held the scuttle had pounded into bits when they
produced that wild jangle which had added so much of dignity and power
to the bass notes of the Dead Mans Chorus

These cold facts aroused in Oliver a sense of repugnance which he could
not shake off It was as if the head of some jolly clown of the night
before had been suddenly thrust through the canvas of the tent in broad
daylight showing the paint the wrinkles beneath the yellow teeth
and the coarse mouth

Oliver was about to turn back to Freds room this feeling of revolt
strong upon him when his attention was arrested by a collection of
drawings that covered almost every square inch of the ceiling To his
astonishment he discovered that what in the smoke of the night before
he had supposed to be only hasty sketches scrawled over the white
plaster were in reality now that he saw them in a clearer atmosphere
effective pictures in pastel oil and charcoal That the basis of
these cartoons was but the grimy stain made by the water which had
beaten through the rickety sash during the drive and thrash of winter
storms flooding the whitewashed ceiling and trickling down the
sidewalls in smears of brown rust did not lessen their value in his
eyes

Closer inspection showed him that these discolorationssome round or
curved others straight or angularhad been altered and amended as the
signatures indicated by the deft pencils of Waller Fred Bowdoin and
the others into flying Cupids Dianas Neptunes and mermaids fit to
grace the ceiling of a salon if properly enlarged while the
upanddown smears had suggested the opportunity for caricaturing half
the boarders of the house Every fresh leak and its accompanying stains
evidently presented a new problem to the painters and were made the
subject of prolonged study and much consultation before a brush was
permitted to touch them the point apparently being to help the
discolorations express themselves with the fewest possible touches

In addition to these decorations overhead Oliver found framed in on
the cleaner plaster of the sidewalls between broad bands of black
paint several taking bits of landscape in color and black and white
stretches of coast with quaint boats and dots of figures winter wood
interiors with white plaster for snow and scrapings of charcoal for
treetrunks each one marked with that sure crispness of touch which
denotes the masterhand Moreover the panels of all the doors as well
as their jambs and frames were ornamented with sketches in all
mediums illustrating incidents in the lives of the various boarders
who occupied the rooms below and whoso Fred told him
afterwardstole into this sacred spot on the sly to gloat over the
nights work whenever a new picture was reported and the rightful
denizens were known to be absent

As he stood absorbed before these marvels of brush and pencil
scrutinizing each one in turn his sense of repulsion for the debris on
the floor gave way to a feeling of enthusiasm Not only were the
sketches far superior to any he had ever seen but the way in which
they were done and the uses of the several mediums were a revelation to
him It was only when Foghorn Cranchs big voice roused him to
consciousness that he realized where he was The auctioneer was coming
out of his room resplendent in a striped suit gaiters and white
necktiethis being his realestate day

My dear fellow Cranch shouted bringing his hand down on Olivers
shoulder do you know youve got a voice like an angels

Before Oliver could reply My Lord Cockburn joined them his first word
one of pleasure at meeting him and his second a hope that he would
know him better then Fred ran out flinging on his coat and laughing
as he came Under these combined influences of praise and goodcheer
Olivers spirits rose and his blood began once more to surge through
his veins With his oldtime buoyancy he put his arm through Freds
while the two tramped gayly down the four flights of stairs to be
ushered into the long narrow stuffy diningroom on the basement
floor there to be presented to the two Misses Teetum who as the young
men entered bent low over their plates in unison This perfunctory
salute our young gentleman acknowledged by bowing grandly in return
after which he dropped into a seat next to Fredshis back to a tin
box filled with plates placed over the hotair registerdrew out a
damp napkin from a bone ring and took a birdseye view of the table
and its occupants

The two Misses Teetum sat one at either endMiss Ann thin severe
precise Miss Sarah stout coy and a trifle kittenish as doubtless
became a young woman of fortyseven and her sisters junior by eight
years Miss Ann had evidently passed the deadline of middle age and
had given up the fight and was fast becoming a very prim and very
proper old lady but Miss Sarah being out of range could still smile
and nod her head and shake her curls and laugh little hollow
girlish laughs and otherwise disport herself in a light and kittenish
way after the manner of her day and age All of which betrayed not
only her earnest desire to please but her increasing anxiety to get in
under matrimonial cover before one of Father Times sharpshooters
picked her off and thus ended her youthful career

The guests seated on either side of these two presiding goddesses
Oliver was convinced as he studied the double row of faces would have
stretched the wondering eyelids of Kennedy Square to their utmost
limits

Old Mr Lang who with his invalid wife occupied the room immediately
below Freds and who had been so nearly drowned out the night before
because of McFudds acrobatic tendencies sat on Freds left Properly
clothed and in his right mind he proved to be a most delightful old
gentleman with gold spectacles and snowwhite sidewhiskers and a
welcoming smile for everyone who entered Fred said that the smile
never wavered even when the old gentleman had been up all night with
his wife

Across the table with her eyeglasses trained on Oliver half
concealed by a huge china compoteer to quote the waitress and at
present filled with last weeks fruit caulked with almonds sat Mrs
Southwark Boggssole surviving relic of S B Esq This misfortune
she celebrated by wearing his daguerreotype set in plain gold as a
brooch with which she fastened her crocheted collar She was a thin
faded funereallooking person her body encased in a black silk dress
which looked as if it had been pressed and ironed over night and her
hands in black silk mitts which reached to her knuckles

On Mrs Boggss right sat Batesa rising young lawyer with political
tendenciesone of the first men to cut his hair so ZouZou that it
stood straight up from his forehead and next to him Morgan the
editor who pored over manuscript while his coffee got cold and then
Nelson and Webster and Cummings all graded in Miss Anns mind as
being eight or ten or twelvedollaraweek men depending on the
rooms that they occupied and farther along toward Miss Sarah Cranch
and Cockburnfivedollar boys these Fred was another with the
privilege of lighting their own coke fires and of trimming the wicks
and filling the bulbs of their own burningfluid lamps And away down
in the far corner crumpled up in his chair crouched the cheery little
hunchback Mr Crumbs who kept a bookstall on Astor Place where
Bayard Taylor Irving Halleck Bryant and many another member of the
Century Club used to spend their late afternoons delving among the old
volumes on his shelves

All these regular boarders including Foghorn Cranch and Fred
breakfasted at eight oclock Waller the painter and Tomlins the
swell breakfasted at nine As to that descendant of the Irish kings
Mr Cornelius McFudd he rose at ten or twelve or two just as the
spirit and its dilutions of the night before moved or retarded him
and breakfasted whenever Miss Ann or Miss Sarah who had presided
continuously at the coffeeurn from eight to ten could spare one of
her two servants to carry a tray to his room

Last and by no means least with her eyes devouring every expression
that flitted across the new arrivals face there beamed out beside
Miss Ann a tail willowy young person whom Fred in answer to an
inquiring lifting of Olivers eyebrows designated as the belle of the
house This engaging young woman really lived with her mother in the
next street but flitted in and out dining or breakfasting or
spending a week at a time with her aunts the Misses Teetum whenever
an opportunity offeredthe opportunity being a vacant and nonpaying
room one of which she was at the time enjoying

This fair damsel who was known to the boarders on the top floor as
our Phemy and to the world at large as Miss Euphemia Teetumthe
real jewel in her name was Phoebe but she had reset ithad been
especially beloved so Fred informed Oliver by every member of the
club except Waller who having lived in boardinghouses all his life
understood her thoroughly Her last flamethe fire was still
smoulderinghad been the immaculate Tomlins who had won her heart by
going into raptures in one of his stage whispers over the classic
outlines of her face This outburst resulted in Miss Euphemia appearing
the following week in a silk gown a Greek fillet and no hoopsa
costume which Waller faithfully portrayed on the sidewall of the attic
the night of her appearancethe fillet being reproduced by a strip of
brass which the artist had torn from his easel and nailed to the
plaster and the classic curves of her hair by a ripple of brown paint

This caricature nearly provoked a riot before the night was over the
whole club including even the funloving McFudd denouncing Wallers
act as an outrage In fact the Hibernian himself had once been so
completely taken off his feetit was the first week of his stayby
the winning ways of the young lady that Miss Ann had begun to have
high hopes of Euphemias being finally installed mistress in one of
those shadowy estates which the distinguished Hibernian described with
such eloquence That these hopes did not materialize was entirely due
to Cockburn who took pains to enlighten the good woman upon the
intangible character of the Hibernians possessions thus saving the
innocent maiden from the clutches of the bold bad adventurer At
least that had been Cockburns account of it when he came upstairs

But it was at dinner that same nightfor Oliver at Freds pressing
invitation had come back to dinnerthat the full galaxy of guests and
regulars burst upon our hero Then came not only Miss Euphemia Teetum
in a costume especially selected for Olivers capture but a person
still more startling and imposingso imposing in fact that when she
entered the room onehalf of the gentlemen present made little backward
movements with the legs of their chairs as if intending to rise to
their feet in honor of her presence

This prominent figure in fashionable life who had now settled herself
on the right of Miss Annthe post of honor at the tableand who was
smiling in so gracious and condescending a manner as her eye lighted on
the several recipients of her favor was none other than the
distinguished Mrs Schuyler Van Tassell of Tarrytown another bird of
passage who had left her countryseat on the Hudson to spend the
winter months in what she called the delights of uppertandem She
belonged to an ancient familyor at least her husband didhe was
under the sod poor soul and therefore at peaceand having inherited
his estatea considerable onewas to be treated with every
distinction

These several personages of low and high degree interested our young
gentleman quite as much as our young gentleman interested them He made
friends with them allespecially with the ladies who all agreed that
he was a most charming and accomplished youth This good opinion became
permanent when Oliver had paid each in turn the compliment of rising
from his seat when any one of them entered the room as much a habit
with the young fellow as the taking off of his hat when he came into a
house but which was so rare a courtesy at Miss Teetums that each
recipient appropriated the compliment as personal to herself

These sentiments of admiration were shared and to an alarming degree
by Miss Euphemia herself who on learning later that Oliver had
decided to occupy half of Freds room through the winter had at once
determined to remain during the week the better to lay siege to his
heart This resolution it is fair to Oliver to say she abandoned
before dinner was over when her experienced eye detected a certain
amused if not derisive smile playing around the corners of Olivers
mouth a discovery which so impressed the young woman that she left him
severely alone ever after

And so it was that Oliver unpacked his trunkthe same old hair trunk
studded with brass nails that had held his fathers wardrobe at
collegespread out and tacked up the various knickknacks which his
mother and Sue and Miss Clendenning had given him when he had left the
old home and began to make himself comfortable on the top floor of
Miss Teetums boardinghouse on Union Square




CHAPTER X

MCFUDDS BRASS BAND


Our hero had been installed at Miss Teetums for a month or more when
one night at dinner a tiny envelope about the size of a visitingcard
was brought in by the middleaged waitress and laid beside Simmonss
plate The envelope contained six orchestra seats at the Winter Garden
and was accompanied by a note which read as follows Bring some of the
boys the piece drags

The musician studied the note carefully and a broad smile broke over
his face As one of the first violins at the Winter Garden with a wide
acquaintance among desirable patrons of the theatre he had peculiar
facilities for obtaining free private boxes and orchestra chairs not
only at his own theatre but often at Wallacks in Broome Street and
the old Bowery Simmons was almost always sure to have tickets when the
new piece needed booming or when an old play failed to amuse and the
audiences had begun to shrink Indeed the mystery of Mrs Schuyler Van
Tassells frequent appearance in the lefthand proscenium box at the
Winter Garden on Friday nightsa mystery unexplained among the
immediate friends in Tarrytown who knew how she husbanded her
resources despite her accredited wealthwas no mystery at all to the
guests at Miss Teetums table who were in the habit of seeing just
such tiny envelopes handed to Simmons during soup and duly passed by
him to that distinguished leader of society Should more than two
tickets be enclosed Mrs Van T would perhaps invite Mr
Ruffleshirt Tomlins or some other properly attired person to
accompany hernever Miss Ann or the little hunchback who dearly loved
the play but who could seldom afford to gonever anybody in fact
who wore plain clothes or looked a compromising acquaintance

On this night however Pussy Meow Simmons ignoring Mrs Van Tassell
turned to Oliver

Ollie he whisperedthe formalities had ceased between the members
of the Skylarksgot anything to do tonight

No why

And then Simmons with various imaginary poundings of imaginary canes
on the threadbare carpet beneath his chair and with sundry
halfsmothered bursts of real laughter in which Fred and Oliver joined
unfolded his programme for the eveninga programme which was agreed to
so rapturously that the trio before dinner was over excused themselves
to their immediate neighbors and bounded upstairs three steps at a
time There they pulled the Walrus out of his bed and woke up McFudd
who had gone to sleep before dinner and whom nobody had called Then
having sent my Lord Cockburn to find Ruffleshirt Tomlins who by this
time was paying court to Miss Euphemia in the front parlor and having
pinned a ticket to Mr Foghorn Cranchs door with instructions to
meet them in the lobby the moment he returned they all slipped on
their overcoats picked up their canes and started for the theatre

Six young fellows all with red blood in their veins steel springs
under their toes and laughter in their hearts Six comrades pals
goodfellows skipping down the avenue as gay as colts and happy as
boysno thought for today and no care for tomorrow Each man with a
free ticket in his pocket and a show ahead of him No wonder the
bluecoats looked after them and smiled no wonder the old fellow with
the shaky legs waiting at the corner for one of the squad to help him
over gave a sigh as he watched McFudd with cane in air drilling his
recruits all five abreast No wonder the tired shopgirls glanced at
them enviously as they swung into Broadway chanting the Dead Mans
Chorus with Olivers voice sounding clear as a bell above the din of
the streets

The play was a melodrama of the old old school There was a young
heroine in white and a handsome lover in topboots and white trousers
and a cruel uncle who wanted her property And there was a particularly
brutal villain with leery eyes ugly mouth with one tooth gone and an
iron jaw like a hulldogs He was attired in a fur cap brown corduroy
jacket with a bloodred handkerchief twisted about his throat and he
carried a bludgeon When the doubledyed villain proceeded in the third
act to pound the head of the lovely maiden to a jelly at the
instigation of the base uncle concealed behind a painted treetrunk
and the lover rushed in and tried to save her every pair of hands
except Olivers came together in raptures of applause assisted by a
vigorous hammering of canes on the floor

Pound away Ollie whispered Simmons thats what we came for you
are spoiling all our fun The manager is watching us Pound away I
tell you There he is inside that box

I wont said Oliver in a tone of voice strangely in contrast with
the joyousness of an hour before

Then you wont get any more free tickets muttered Simmons in
surprise

I dont want them I dont believe in murdering people on the stage
or anywhere else That mans face is horrible Im sorry I came

Simmons laughed and shielding his mouth with his hand repeated
Olivers outburst to Waller who having first sent news of it down the
line reached over and shook Olivers hand gravely while he wiped a
theatrical tear from his eye while my Lord Cockburn with feet and
hands still busy returned word to Oliver by Tomlins not to make a
colossal ass of himself Oliver bore their ridicule goodnaturedly
but without receding from his opinion in any way a fact which
ultimately raised him in the estimation of the group Only when the
villain was thrown over the pasteboard cliff into a canvas sea by the
gentleman in topboots to be devoured by sharks or cut up by pirates
or otherwise disposed of as befitted so bloodthirsty and cruel a
monster did Oliver join in the applause

The play over and Simmons having duly reported to the managerwho was
delighted with the activity of the feet but who advised that next time
the sticks be left at homethe happy party sailed up Broadway this
time by threes and twos swinging their canes as before and threading
their way in and out of the throngs that filled the street

The first stop was made at the corner of Thirteenth Street by McFudd
who turned his troop abruptly to the right and marched them down a
flight of steps into a cellar where they immediately attacked a huge
washtub filled with steamed clams and covered with a white cloth to
keep them hot This was the bars free lunch The clams devouredsix
eachand the necessary beers paid for the whole party started to
retrace their steps when Simmons stopped to welcome a newcorner who
had entered the cellar unperceived by the barkeeper and who was
bending over the washtub of clams engaged in picking out the smallest
of the bivalves with the end of all iron fork He had such a
benevolent kindly face and was so courtly in his bearing and spoke
with so soft and gentle a voice that Oliver who stood next to
Simmons lingered to listen

Oh my dear Simmons cried the old gentleman we missed you
tonight When are you coming back to us The orchestra is really
getting to be deplorable Miss Gannon quite broke down in her song We
must protest my boy we must protest I saw you in front but you
should be wielding the baton And is this young gentleman one of your
friends

YesMr Horn Ollie let me introduce you to Mr Gilbert the
actorand he laid his hand on Olivers shoulderdear John Gilbert
as we always call him

Oliver looked up into the kindly sweet face of the man and a curious
sensation passed over him Could this courtly perfectly wellbred old
gentleman with his silverwhite hair beaming smile and gentle voice
the equal of any of his fathers guests be an actor Could he possibly
belong to the profession which of all others Oliver had been taught
to despise The astonishment of our young hero was so great that for a
moment he could not speak

Simmons thought he read Olivers mind and came to his rescue

My friend Mr Horn did not like the play tonight Mr Gilbert he
said He thinks the deathscene was horribleand Simmons glanced
smiling at the others who stood at a little distance watching the
interview with great interest

Dear me dear me you dont say so What was it you objected to may I
ask There was a trace of anxiety in his voice

Why the murderscene sir It seemed to me too dreadful to kill a
woman in that way I havent forgotten it yet and a distressed look
passed over Olivers face But then I have seen but very few plays
he addednone like that

The old actor looked at him with a relieved expression

Ah yes I see Yes youre indeed right As you say it is quite a
dreadful scene

Oh then youve seen it yourself sir said Oliver in a relieved
tone

The old actors eyes twinkled He too had read the young mans
mindnot a difficult task when one looked down into Olivers eyes

Oh many many times he answered with a smile I have known it for
years In the old days when they would smash the poor ladys head
they used to have a pan of gravel which they would crunch with a stick
to imitate the breaking of the bones It was quite realistic from the
front but that was given up long ago How did YOU like the business
tonight Mr Simmons and he turned to the musician

Oh admirable sir We all thought it had never been better played or
better put on and he glanced again toward his companions who stood
apart listening breathlessly to every word that fell from the actors
lips

Ah I am glad of it Brougham will be so pleasedand yet it shocked
you Mr Hornand you really think the poor lady minded it Dear me
How pleased she will be when I tell her the impression it all made upon
you Shes worked so hard over the part and has been so nervous about
it I left her only a moment agoshe and her husband wanted me to take
supper with them at Rileysthe new restaurant on University Place
you know famous for its devilled crabs But I always like to come here
for my clams Allow me a moment and he bent over the steaming tub
and skewering the contents of a pair of shells with his iron fork held
it out toward Oliver

Let me beg of you Mr Horn to taste this clam I am quite sure it is
a particularly savory one After this my dear young friend I hope
youll have a better opinion of me And his eye twinkled I am really
better than I lookindeed I amand so my dear boy is this clam
Come come it is getting cold

What do you mean by a better opinion of you Mr Gilbert stammered
Oliver He had been completely captivated by the charm of the actors
manner Why shouldnt I think well of youI dont understand

Whybecause I strangled the poor lady tonight You know of
coursethat it was I who played the villain

You exclaimed Oliver No I did not sir Why Mr Gilbert I cant
realizeoh I hope youll forgive me for what Ive said Ive only
been in New York a short time and

The old gentleman cut short Olivers explanation with a wave of his
fork and looking down into the boys face said in a serious tone

My son youre quite right Quite rightand I like you all the better
for it All such plays are dreadful I feel just as you do about them
but what can we actors do The public will have it that way

Another little prejudice toppled from its pedestal another household
tradition of Olivers smashed into a thousand pieces at his feet This
rubbing and grinding process of man against man this seeing with ones
own eyes and not anothers was fast rounding out and perfecting the
impressionable clay of our young gentlemans mind It was a lesson
too the scribe is delighted to say which our hero never forgot nor
did he ever forget the man who taught it One of his greatest delights
in afteryears was to raise his hat to this incomparable embodiment of
the dignity and courtliness of the old school The old gentleman had
long since forgotten the young fellow but that made no difference to
Oliverhe would cross the street any time to lift his hat to dear John
Gilbert

The introduction of the other members of the club to the villain being
overthey had stood the whole time they were listening to the actor
each head uncoveredMcFudd again marshalled his troop and proceeded up
Broadway where at Olivers request they were halted at the pedestal
of the big Bronze Horse and within sight of their own quarters

Here McFudd insisted that the club should sing God Save the Queen to
the Father of his Country where he sat astride of his horse which was
accordingly done much to the delight of a couple of nightwatchmen
who watched the entire performance and who upon McFudds subsequent
inspection proved to be fellowcountrymen of the distinguished
Hibernian

Had the buoyant and irrepressible Irishman been content with this
patriotic outburst as the final windingup of the nights outing and
had he then and there betaken himself and his fellows off to bed the
calamity which followed and which so nearly wrecked the Skylarks
might have been avoided

It is difficult at any time to account for the workings of Fate or to
follow the course of its agents The track of an earthworm destroys a
dam the parting of a wire wrecks a bridge the breaking of a root
starts an avalanche the flaw in an axle dooms a train the sting of a
microbe depopulates a city But none of these unseen mysterious
agencies was at worknothing so trivial wrecked the Skylarks

It was a German streetband

A band whose several members had watched McFudd and his party from
across the street and who had begun limbering their instruments before
the sextet had ceased singing regarding the situation no doubt as
pregnant with tips

McFudd did not give the cornet time to draw his instrument from its
woollen bag before he had him by the arm

Dont put a mouthful of wind into that horn of yours until I spake to
ye he cried in vociferous tones

The leader stopped and looked at him in a dazed way

I have an idea gentlemen added McFudd turning to his companions
and tapping his forehead I am of the opinion that this music would be
wasted on the night air and so with your parmission I propose to
transfer this orchestra to the top flure where we can listen to their
chunes at our leisure Right about face Forward March and McFudd
advanced upon the band wheeled the drum around and locking arms with
the cornet started across the street for the stone steps

Not a word out of any o ye till I get em in McFudd continued in a
low voice fumbling in his pocket for his nightkey

The musicians obeyed mechanically and tiptoed one by one inside the
dimly lighted hall followed by Oliver and the others

Now take off your shoes youve four flights of stairs to crawl up
and if ye make a noise until Im ready for ye off goes a dollar of
your pay

The bassdrum carefully backed his instrument against the wall sat
down on the floor and began pulling off his boots the cornet and
bassoon followed the clarionet wore only his gum shoes and so was
permitted to keep them on

Now Walley me boy do you go ahead and turn up the gas and open the
piano and Cockburn old man will ye kindly get the blower and tongs
out of Freddies room and the scuttle out of Tomlinss closet and the
Chinese gong that hangs over me bed And all you fellers go ahead
treading on whispers dye moind said McFudd under his breath Ill
bring up this gang with me Not a breath out of any o yez remimber
till I get there The drums unhandy and we got to go slow wid it and
he slipped the strap over his head and started upstairs followed by
the band

The ascent was made without a sound until old Mr Langs door was
reached when McFudds foot slipped and but for the bassoonists
head both the Irishman and the drum would have rolled downstairs
Lang heard the sound and recognizing the character of the attendant
imprecation did not get up Its only McFudd he said quietly to his
suddenly awakened wife

Once safe upon the attic floor the band who were entering with great
gusto into the spirit of the occasion arranged themselves in a
halfcircle about the piano replaced their shoes stripped their
instruments of their coveringsthe cornetist breathing noiselessly
into the mouthpieces to thaw out the frostand stood at attention for
McFudds orders

By this time Simmons had taken his seat at the piano Cockburn held the
blower and tongs Cranch who on coming in had ignored the card tacked
to his door and who was found fast asleep in his chair was given the
coalscuttle and little Tomlins grasped his own washbasin in one hand
and Freds poker in the other Oliver was to sing the air and Fred was
to beat a tattoo on Wallers door with the butt end of a cane The gas
had been turned up and every kerosene lamp had been lighted and ranged
about the hall McFudd threw off his coat and vest cocked a Scotch
smokingcap over one eye and seizing the Chinese gong in one hand and
the wooden mallet in the other climbed upon the piano and faced his
motley orchestra

Attintion gentlemen whispered McFudd

The first chune will be Old Dog Tray because it begins wid a lovely
howl Remimber now when I hit this gong thats the signal for yez to
begin and yell all come together wid wan smash Then the band will
play a bar or two and then every man Jack o ye will go strong on the
chorus Are yez ready

McFudd swung his mallet over his head poised it for an instant ran
his eye around the circle with the air of an impresario saw that the
drum was in position the horns and clarionet ready the blower
scuttle tongs and other instruments of torture in place and hit the
gong with all his might

The crash that followed woke every boarder in the house and tumbled
half of them out of their beds Long before the chorus had been reached
all the doors had been thrown open and the halls and passageways
filled with the startled boarders Then certain mysteriouslooking
figures in bedgowns waterproofs and bathrobes began bounding up
the stairs and a collection of dishevelled heads were thrust through
the door of the attic Some of the suddenly awakened boarders tried to
stop the din by protest others threatened violence one or two grinned
with delight Among these last was the little hunchback swathed in a
blanket like an Indian chief and barefooted He had rushed upstairs at
the first sound as fast as his little legs could carry him and was
peering under the arms of the others rubbing his sides with glee and
laughing like a boy Mrs Schuyler Van Tassell whose head and
complexion were not ready for general inspection had kept her door
partly closed opening it only wide enough when the other boarders
rushed by to let her voice throughalways an unpleasant organ when
that lady had lost her temper

As the face of each new arrival appeared in the doorway McFudd would
bow gracefully in recognition of the honor of its presence and
redouble his attack on the gong The noise he produced was only
equalled by that of the drum which never ceased for an
instantMcFudds orders being to keep that instrument going
irrespective of time or tune

In the midst of this uproar of brass strings sheepskin washbowls
broken coal pokers and tongs a lean figure in curlpapers and
slippers bright red calico wrapper reaching to the floor and a
lighted candle in one hand forced its way through the crowd at the
door and stood out in the glare of the gaslights facing McFudd

It was Miss Ann Teetum

Instantly a silence fell upon the room

Gentlemen this is outrageous she cried in a voice that ripped
through the air like a saw I have put up with these disgraceful
performances as long as I am going to Not one of you shall stay in my
house another night Out you go in the morning every one of you bag
and baggage

McFudd attempted to make an apology Oliver stepped forward the color
mounting to his cheeks and Waller began a protest at the unwarrantable
intrusion but the infuriated little woman waved them all aside and
turning abruptly marched back through the door and down the staircase
preceded by the other female boarders The little hunchback alone
remained He was doubled up in a knot wiping the tears from his eyes
his breath gone from excessive laughter

The Skylarkers looked at each other in blank astonishment One of the
longcherished traditions of the house was the inviolability of this
attic Its rooms were let with an especial privilege guaranteeing its
privacy with free license to make all the noise possible provided the
racket was confined to that one floor So careful had been its
occupants to observe this rule that noisy as they all were when once
on the top floor every man unlocked the front door at night with the
touch of a burglar and crept upstairs as noiselessly as a footpad

Im sorry men said McFudd looking into the astounded faces about
him Im the last man as ye know to hurt anybodys feelings But
what the divils got into the old lady Whod a thought she would
have heard a word of it down where she sleeps in the basement

Tis the Van Tassell grunted the Walrus Shes so mesmerized the
old woman lately that she dont know her own mind

What makes you think she put her up to it Waller asked Cranch

I dont thinkbut its just like her answered Waller with
illogical prejudice

My eye wasnt she a beauty laughed Fred and he picked up a bit of
charcoal and began an outline of the wrapper and slippers on the
sidewall

Tomlins Cranch and the others had no suggestions to offer Their
minds were too much occupied in wondering what was going to become of
them in the morning

The German band by this time had regained their usual solidity The
leader seemed immensely relieved He had evidently expected the next
apparition to be a bluecoat with a pair of handcuffs

Put their green jackets on em McFudd said to the leader quietly
pointing to the instruments Were much obliged to you and your men
for coming up and he slipped some notes into the leaders hand Now
get downstairs every man o ye as aisy as if ye were walking on eggs
Cranch old man will ye see em out to kape that infernal drum from
butting into the Van Tassells door or well have another hornets
nest Begorra theres wan thing very sureits little baggage ILL
have to move out


The next morning a row of six vacant seats stared Miss Ann out of
countenance The outcasts had risen early and had gone to Rileys for
their breakfast Miss Ann sat at the coffeeurn as stiff and erect as
an avenging judge Lofty purpose and grim determination were written in
every line of her face Mrs Van Tassell was not in evidence Her
nerves had been so shattered by the nights orgy she had said to
Miss Ann that she should breakfast in her room She further notified
Miss Teetum that she should at once withdraw her protecting presence
from the establishment and leave it without a distinguished social
head if the dwellers on the top floor remained another day under the
same roof with herself

An ominous silence and depressing gloom seemed to hang over everybody
Several of the older men pushed back their plates and began drumming oh
the tablecloth with their fingers a faraway look in their eyes One
or two talked in whispers their coffee untasted Old Mr Lang looked
down the line of empty seats and took his place with a dejected air He
was the oldest man in the house and the oldest boarder this gave him
certain privileges one being to speak his mind

I understand he said unfolding his napkin and facing Miss Ann
that you have ordered the boys out of the house

Yes I have snapped out Miss Teetum

Everybody looked up No one recognized the tone of her voice it was so
sharp and bitter

Why may I ask

I will not have my house turned into a beargarden thats why

Thats better than a graveyard retorted Mr Lang Thats what the
house would be without them I cant understand why you object You
sleep in the basement and shouldnt hear a sound my wife and I sleep
under them every night If we can stand it you can You send the boys
away Miss Teetum and well move out

Miss Ann winced under the shot but she did not answer

Do you mean that youre going to turn the young gentlemen into the
street Miss Ann whined Mrs Southwark Boggs in an injured tone from
her end of the table Are we going to have no young life in the house
at all I wont stay a day after theyre gone

Miss Teetum changed color but she looked straight ahead of her She
evidently did not want her private affairs discussed at the table

I shall want my bill at the end of the week now that the boys are to
leave remarked the little hunchback to Miss Ann as he bent over her
chair Life is dreary enough as it is

And so the boys stayed on

Only one room became vacant at the end of the month That was Mrs
Schuyler Van Tassells




CHAPTER XI

A CHANGE OF WIND


The affair of the brass band with its dramatic and most unlookedfor
ending left an unpleasant memory in the minds of the members of the
club especially in Olivers His training had been somewhat different
from that of the others present and his oversensitive nature had been
more shocked than pleased by it all While most of the other
participants regretted the illfeeling which had been aroused in Miss
Teetums mind they felt surein fact they knewthat this heretofore
kind and gentle hostess could never have fanned her wrath to so white a
heat had not some other hand besides her own worked the bellows

Suspicion first fell upon a new boarder unaccustomed to the ways of the
house who it was reported had doublelocked herself in at the first
crash of the drum and who had admitted on being crossexamined by
McFudd that she had nearly broken her back in trying to barricade her
bedroom door with a Saratoga trunk and a washstand This theory was
abandoned when subsequent inquiries brought to light the fact that Mrs
Van Tassell when the echoes of one of McFudds songs had reached her
ears had stated a week before that no respectable boardinghouse would
tolerate uproars like those which took place almost nightly on the top
floor and that she would withdraw her protection from Miss Euphemia
and leave the house at once and forever if the noise did not cease
This dire threat being duly reported to the two Misses Teetum hadit
was afterward learnedso affected them both that Miss Ann had gone to
bed with a chill and Miss Sarah had warded off another with a bowl of
hot camomile tea

This story true as it undoubtedly was did not entirely clear up the
situation One part of it sorely puzzled McFudd Why did Miss Euphemia
need Mrs Van Tassells protection and why should the loss of it stir
Miss Ann to so violent an outburst This question no member of the
Skylarks could answer

The solution came that very night and in the most unexpected way
Waller bearing the glad tidings

Miss Euphemia ignoring them all was to be married at St Marks at 6
PM on the following Monday and Mrs Van Tassell was to take charge
of the wedding reception in the front parlor The groom was the strange
young man who had sat for some days beside Miss Euphemia passing as
Miss Anns nephew and who really was a welltodo druggist with a shop
on Astor Place All of the regular boarders of the house were to be
invited

The explosion of this matrimonial bomb so cleared the air of all doubt
as to the guilt of Mrs Van Tassell that a secret meeting attended by
every member of the Skylarks was at once held in Wallers room with
the result that Miss Anns invitations to the wedding were unanimously
accepted Not only would the resident members goso the original
resolution ranbut the nonresident and outside members would also be
on hand to do honor to Miss Euphemia and her distinguished chaperone
This amendment being accepted McFudd announced in a sepulchral tone
that owing to the severity of the calamity and to the peculiarly
painful circumstances which surrounded their esteemed fellowskylarker
the Honorable Sylvester Ruffleshirt Tomlins his fellowmembers would
wear crape on their left arms for thirty days This also was carried
unanimously every man except Ruffleshirt Tomlins breaking out into
the Dead Mans Chorusa song McFudd explained admirably fitted to
the occasion

When the auspicious night arrived the several dresssuits of the
members were duly laid out on the piano and hung over the chairs and
each gentleman proceeded to array himself in costume befitting the
occasion Waller who weighed 200 pounds squeezed himself into
McFudds coat and trousers McFudd weighed 150 the trousers reaching
a little below the painters knees McFudd wrapped Wallers coat about
his thin girth and turned up the bagging legs of the unmentionables
six inches above his shoes The assorted costumes of the other members
were equally grotesque The habiliments themselves were of proper cut
and make according to the standards of the timespiketailed coats
white ties patentleather pumps and the customary trimmings but the
effects produced were as ludicrous as they were incongruous though the
studied bearing of the gentlemen was meant to prove their
unconsciousness of the fact

The astonishment that rested on Mrs Van Tassells face when this
motley group filed into the parlor and with marked and punctilious
deference paid their respects to the bride and the wrath that flashed
in Miss Euphemias eyes became ever after part of the traditions of
the club Despite Mrs Van Tassells protest against the uproar on the
top floor she had invariably spoken in high terms to her friends and
intimates of these very boarderstheir acquaintance was really part of
her social capitalcommenting at the same time upon their exalted
social and artistic positions In fact many of her own special guests
had attended the wedding solely in the hope of being brought into more
intimate relations with this distinguished group of painters editors
and musicians some of whom were already being talked about

When however McFudd stood in the corner of Miss Teetums parlor like
a halfscared boy pulling out the fingers of Wallers kid gloves an
inch too long for him and Waller Fred and my Lord Cockburn stumbled
over the hearthrug one after the other and Oliver feeling like a
guilty man and a boor bowed and scraped like a dancingmaster and
Bowdoin the painter and Simmons and Foghorn Cranch talked platitudes
with faces as grave as undertakers the expectant special guests
invited by Mrs Van Tassell began to look upon her encomiums as part of
an advertising scheme to fill Miss Teetums rooms

The impression made upon the Teetum contingent by the appearance and
manners of the several memberseven Olivers reputation was
ruinedwas equally disastrous It was perhaps best voiced by the
druggist groom when he informed Mrs Van T from behind his
lemoncolored glovethat if that was the gang he had heard so much
of he didnt want no more of em

But these and other jollifications were not long to continue Causes
infinitely more serious were at work undermining the foundations of the
Skylarks The Lodge of Poverty to which they all belonged gay as it
had often been was slowly closing its door the unexpected which
always hangs over life was about to happen the tie which bound these
men together was slowly loosening Its members might give the grip of
fellowship to other members in other lodges over the globe but no
longer in this one on the top floor of the house on Union Square

One morning McFudd broke the seal of an importantlooking letter
bearing a Dublin postmark on the upper righthand corner of the
envelope and the family crest on its flap For some moments he sat
still looking straight before him Then two tears stole out and
glistened on his lashes

Boys he said slowly the governor says I must come home and he
held up a steamer ticket and a draft that barely equalled his dues for
a months board and washing

That night he pawned his new white overcoat with the bone buttons and
velvet collarthe one his father had sent him and which had been the
envy of every man in the club and invested every penny of the proceeds
in a supper to be given to the Skylarks The invitation ran as follows

Mr Cornelius McFudd respectively requests the pleasure of your
presence at an informal wake to be held in honor of a doublebreasted
overcoat London cut The body and tail will be the ducks and the two
sleeves and velvet collar the Burgundy

Rileys 8 pm Third floor back

The following week he packed his two tin boxes boarded the Scotia and
sailed for home


The keystone having dropped out it was not long before the balance of
the structure came down about the ears of the members My Lord Cockburn
the following week was ordered South by the bank to look after some
securities locked up in a vault in a Georgia trust company and which
required a special messenger to recover themthe growing uneasiness in
mercantile circles over the political outlook of the country having
assumed a serious aspect Cockburn had to swim rivers he wrote Oliver
in his first letter and cross mountains on horseback and sleep in a
negro hut besides having a variety of other experiences to say
nothing of several hairbreadth escapes none of which availed him as
he returned home after all without the bonds

These financial straws indicating the direction and force of the
coming political winds began to accumulate The lull before the
hurricanethe stagnation in commercial circlesbecame so ominous that
soon the outside members and guests of the club ceased coming being
diligently occupied in earning their bread and then Simmons sent the
piano homeit had been loaned to him by reason of his profession and
positionand only Foghorn Cranch Waller Fred Oliver and
Ruffleshirt Tomlins were left Alter a while Waller gave up his room
and slept in his studio and got his meals at the St Clair or went
without them so light by reason of the hard times was the demand for
sheep pictures of Wallers particular make And later on Tomlins went
abroad and Cranch moved West And so the ruin of the club was
complete and so too this merry band of roysterers with one or two
exceptions passes out of those pages

Dear boys of the long ago what has become of you all since those old
days in that garretroom on Union Square Tomlins I know turned up in
Australia where he married a very rich and very lovely woman because
he distinctly stated both of those facts in an exuberant letter to
Oliver when he invited him to the wedding Not a bad journeyonly a
step my dear Ollie and we shall be so delighted to see you I know
this to be true for Oliver showed me the letter Bowdoin went to
Paris where as we all remember he had a swell studio opening on to a
garden somewhere near the Arc de Triomphe and had carriages stop at
his door and a butler to open it and two maids in white caps to help
the ladies off with their wraps Poor Cranch died in Montana while
hunting for gold and my Lord Cockburn went back to London

But does anybody know what has become of McFuddirresistible
irresponsible altogether delightful McFudd that condensation of all
that was joyous rollicking and spontaneous that devotee of the tub
and pink of neatness immaculate cleanshaven and wellgroomed that
soul of goodnature which no number of flowing bowls could disturb nor
succeeding headaches dull that most generous of souls whose first
impulse was to cut squarely in half everything he owned and give you
your choice of the pieces and who never lost his temper until you
refused them both If you my dear boy are still wandering about this
earth and your eye should happen to fall on these pages remember I
send you my greeting If you have been sent for and have gone aloft to
cheer those others who have gone before and who could spare you no
longer speak a good word for me please and then perhaps I may
shake your hand again


With the dissolution of the happy coterie there came to Oliver many a
lonely night under the cheap lamp the desolate hall outside looking
all the more desolate and uninviting with the piano gone and the lights
extinguished

Yet these nights were not altogether distasteful to Oliver Fred had
noticed for months that his roommate no longer entered into the
frolics of the club with the zest and vim that characterized the
earlier days of the young Southerners sojourn among them Our hero had
said nothing while the men had held together and to all outward
appearances had done his share not only with his singing but in any
other way in which he could help on the merriment He had covered the
space allotted to him on the walls with caricatures of the several
boarders below He had mixed the salad at Rileys the night of McFudds
farewell supper with his sleeves rolled up to the elbows and the
cooks cap on his head He had lined up with the others at Browns on
the Bowery drank his crystal cocktailsthe mildest of
beveragesand had solemnly marched out again with his comrades in a
lockstep like a gang of convicts He had indulged in fortycent opera
leaning over the iron railing of the top row of the Academy of Music
and had finished the evening at Pfaffs drinking beer and munching
hardtack and pickles and had laughed and sung in a dozen other equally
absurd escapades And yet it was as plain as daylight to Fred that
Olivers heart was no longer centred in the life about him

The fact is the scribe is compelled to admit the life indulged in by
these merry bohemians had begun to pall upon this most sensitive of
young gentlemen It really had not satisfied him at all This was not
the sort of life that Mr Crocker meant he had said to himself after a
night at Rileys when Cranch had sounded his horn so loud that the
proprietor had threatened to turn the whole party into the street Mr
Crockers temperament was too restful to be interested in such
performances As for himself he was tired of it

Nothing of all this did he keep from his mother The record of his
likes and dislikes which formed the subjectmatter of his daily letters
was an absorbing study with her and she let no variation of the
weathervane of his tastes escape her Nor did she keep their contents
from her intimate friends She had read to Colonel Clayton one of his
earlier ones in which he had told her of the concerts and of the way
Cockburn had served the brew that McFudd had concocted and had shown
him an illustration Oliver had drawn on the margin of the sheetan
outline of the china mug that held the mixtureto which that
Chesterfield of a Clayton had replied

What did I tell you madamejust what I expected of those
Yankeespunch from mugs Bah

She had too talked their contents over with Amos Cobb who since the
confidence reposed in him by the Horn family had become a frequent
visitor at the house

Theres no harm come to him yet madame or he wouldnt write you of
what he does Boys will be boys Let him have his fling the Vermonter
had replied with a gleam of pleasure in his eye If he has the stuff
in him that I think he has he will swim out and get to higher ground
if he hasnt better let him drown early It will give everybody less
trouble

The dear lady had lost no sleep over these escapades She too
realized that as long as Oliver poured out his heart unreservedly to
her there was little to fear In her efforts to cheer him she had
sought in her almost daily letters sent him in return to lead his
thoughts into other channels She knew how fond he had always been of
the society of women and how necessary they were to his happiness and
she begged him to go out more Surely there must be some young girls
in so great a city who can help to make your life happier she wrote

In accordance with her suggestions he had at last put on his best
clothes and had accompanied Tomlins and Fred to some very delightful
houses away up in Thirtythird Street and another on Washington
Square and still another near St Marks Place where his personality
and his sweet sympathetic voice had gained him friends and most
pressing invitations to call again Some he had accepted and some he
had notit depended very largely on his mood and upon the people whom
he met If they reminded him in any way either in manners or
appointments of his life at home he went againif not he generally
stayed away

Among these was the house of his employer Mr Slade who had treated
him with marked kindness not only inviting him to his own house but
introducing him to many of his friendsan unusual civility Oliver
discovered afterwardnot many of the clerks being given a seat at Mr
Slades table I like his brusque hearty manner Oliver wrote to his
mother after the first visit His wife is a charming woman and so are
the two daughters quite independent and fearless and entirely
different from the girls at home but most interesting and so well
bred

Another incident too had greatly pleased not only Oliver and his
mother but Richard as well It happened that a consignment of goods
belonging to Morton Slade  Co was stored in a warehouse in
Charleston and it became necessary to send one of the clerks South to
reship or sell them the ordinary business methods being unsafe owing
to the continued rumblings of the now rapidly approaching political
storma storm that promised to be infinitely more serious than the
financial stringency The choice had fallen on Oliver he being a
Southerner and knowing the ways of the people He had advised with his
mother and stood ready to leave at an hours notice when Mr Slades
heart failed him

Its too dangerous my lad he said to Oliver I could trust you I
know and I believe you would return safely and bring the goods or the
money with you but I should never forgive myself if anything should
happen to you I will send an older man And he did

It was at this time that Oliver had received Cockburns letter telling
him of his own experiences and he therefore knew something of the
risks a man would run and could appreciate Mr Slades action all the
more Richard as soon as he heard of it had put down his tools left
his workbench and had gone into his library where he had written the
firm a letter of thanks couched in terms so quaint and courtly and so
full of generous appreciation of their interest in Oliver that Mr
Slade equally appreciative had worn it into ribbons in showing it to
his friends as a model of style and chirography

Remembering his mothers wishes and in appreciation of his employers
courtesy he had kept up this intimacy with the Slade family until an
unfortunate catastrophe had occurred which while it did not affect his
welcome at their house ruined his pleasure while there

Mr Slade had invited Oliver to dinner one rainy night and being too
poor to pay for a cab Oliver in attempting to cross Broadway had
stepped into a mudpuddle a foot deep He must either walk back and
change his shoes and be late for dinneran unpardonable offenceor he
must keep on and run his chances of cleaning them in the dressingroom
There was no dressingroom available as it turned out and the fat
English butler had to bring a wet cloth out into the hall oh how he
wished for Malachi and get down on his stiff knees and wipe away
vigorously before Oliver could present himself before his hostess the
dinner in the meantime getting cold and the guests being kept waiting
Oliver could never look at those shoes after that without shivering

This incident had kept him at home for a time and had made him chary of
exposing himself to similar mortifications His stock of clothes at
best was limitedespecially his shoesand as the weather continued
bad and the streets impassable he preferred waiting for clearer skies
and safer walking So he spent his nights in his room crooning over
the coke fire with Fred or all alone if Fred were at the Academy
drawing from the cast

On these nights he would begin to long for Kennedy Square He had said
nothing yet about returning even for a days visit He knew how his
mother felt about it and he knew how he had seen her struggle to keep
the interest paid up on the mortgage and to meet the daily necessities
of the house The motor was still incomplete she wrote him and
success was as far off as ever The mortgage had again been extended
and the note renewedthis time for a longer term owing to some
friends interest in the matter whose name she could not learn She
therefore felt no uneasiness on that score although there were still
no pennies which could be spared for Olivers travelling expenses even
if he could get leave of absence from his employers

At these times as he sat alone in his garretroom Malachis chuckle
without cause or reminder would suddenly ring in his ears or some low
strain from his fathers violin or a soft note from Nathans flute
would float through his brain Dear Uncle Nat he would break out
speaking aloud and springing from his chairI wish I could hear you
tonight

His only relief while in these moods was to again seize his pen and
pour out his heart to his mother or to his father or to Miss
Clendenning or old Mr Crocker Occasionally he would write to Suenot
oftenfor that volatile young lady had so far forgotten Oliver as to
leave his letters unanswered for weeks at a time She was singing
Dixie she told him in her last billetdoux now a month old and
wondering whether Oliver was getting to be a Yankee and whether he
would be coming home with a high collar and his hair cut short and
parted in the middle

His fathers letters in return did not lessen his gloom These
agitators will destroy the country my son if they keep on Richard
had written in his last letter It is a sin against civilization to
hold your fellowmen in bondage and that is why years ago I gave
Malachi and Hannah and the others their freedom but Virginia has
unquestionably the right to govern her internal affairs without
consulting Massachusetts and that is what many of these Northern
leaders do not or will not understand I am greatly disturbed over the
situation and I sincerely hope your own career will not be affected by
these troubles As to my own affairs all I can say is that I work
early and late and am out of debt Poor fellow He thought he was

Oliver was sitting thus one night his head in his hands elbows on his
knees gazing into the smouldering coals of his grate his favorite
attitude when his mind was troubled when Fred his face aglow his big
blue eyes dancing threw wide the door and bounded in bringing in his
clothes the fresh cool air of the night He had been at work in the
School of the Academy of Design and had a drawing in chalk under his
arma head of the young Augustus

Whats the matter Ollie got the blues

No Freddie only thinking

Whats her name Ill go and see her and make it up Out with itdo I
know her

Oliver smiled faintly examined the drawing for a moment and handing
it back to Fred said sadly Its not a girl Freddie but I dont
seem to get anywhere

Fred threw the drawing on the bed and squeezed himself into the chair
beside his chum his arm around his neck

Where do you want to get old man Whats the matterany trouble at
the store

Nonone that I know of But the life is so monotonous Fred You do
what you love to do I mark boxes all day till lunchtime then I roll
them out on the sidewalk and make out dray tickets till I come home
Ive been doing that all winter I expect to be doing it for years
That dont get me anywhere does it I hate the life more and more
every day

Was our heros old love of change again asserting itself or was it
only the pinching of that Chinese shoe which his mother in her anxiety
had slipped on his unresisting foot and which he was still wearing to
please her Or was it the upper pressure of some inherent talentsome
gift of his ancestors that would not down at his own bidding or that of
his mother or anybody elses

Somebodys got to do it Ollie and you are the last man hired
remarked Fred quietly What would you like to do

Oliver shifted himself in the crowded chair until he could look into
his roommates eyes

Fred old man he answered his voice choking I havent said a word
to you about it all the time Ive been here for I dont like to talk
about a thing that hurts me and so Ive kept it to myself Now Ill
tell you the truth just as it is I dont want Mr Slades work nor
anybody elses work I dont like business and never will I want to
paint and Ill never be happy until I do Thats it fair and square

Well quit Slade then and come with me

I would if it wasnt for mother I promised her I would see this
through and I will As he spoke the overdue mortgage and his mothers
efforts to keep the interest paid passed in review before him

Fred caught his breath It astonished him independent young Northerner
as he was to hear a fullgrown man confess that his mothers
apronstrings still held him up but he made no comment

Why not try both he cried Theres a place in the school alongside
of mewell work together nights It wont interfere with what you do
downtown Youll get a good start and when you have a day off in the
summer you can do some outdoor work Waller has told me a dozen times
that you draw better than he did when he commenced Come along with me

This conversation with the other incidents of the day or rather that
part of it which had reference to the Academy was duly set forth in
his next letter to his mothernot as an argument to gain her consent
to his studying with Fred for he knew it was the last thing she would
agree tobut because it was his habit to tell her everything It would
show her too how good a fellow Fred was and what an interest he took
in his welfare Her answer three days later sent him bounding
upstairs and into their room like a whirlwind

Read Fred read he cried I can go Mother says she thinks it
would be the best thing in the world for me Here clap your eyes on
that and Oliver held the letter out to Fred his finger pointing to
this passage I wish you would join Fred at the Academy Now that you
have a regular business that occupies your mind and are earning your
living I have no objection to your studying drawing or learning any
other accomplishment You work hard all day and this will rest you

The cramped foot was beginning to spread The Chinese shoe had lost its
top button




CHAPTER XII

AROUND THE MILO


Still another new and far more bewildering world was opened to Oliver
the night that he entered the castroom of the School of the National
Academy of Design and took his seat among the students

The title of the institution highsounding as it was not only
truthfully expressed the objects and purposes of its founders but was
wofully exact in the sense of its being national for outside the bare
walls of these rooms there was hardly a students easel to be found the
country over

And such forlorn desolate rooms up two flights of dusty stairs in a
rickety dingy loft off Broadway within a short walk of Union
Squarean auctionroom on the ground floor and a barroom in the rear
The largest of these rooms was used for the annual exhibition of the
Academicians and their associates and the smaller ones were given over
to the students one a better lighted apartment being filled with the
usual collection of caststhe Milo the Fighting Gladiator Apollo
Belvidere Venus de Medici etc etc the other being devoted to the
uses of the lifeclass and its models Not the nude Whatever may have
been clone in the studios in the classroom it was always the draped
model that posedthe old woman who washed for a living on the top
floor or one of her chubby children or buxom daughters or perhaps the
peddler who strayed in to sell his wares and left his head behind him
on ten different canvases and in as many different positions

The casts themselves were backed up against the walls some facing the
windows for lights and darks and others pushed toward the middle of
the room where the glow of the gasjets could accentuate their better
points The Milo by right of divinity held the centre positionshe
being beautiful from any point of sight and available from any side
The Theseus and the Gladiator stood in the corners affording space for
the stools of two or three students and their necessary easels
Scattered about on the coarse whitewashed walls were hung the smaller
lifecasts fragments of the bodyan arm leg or hand or sections of
a headand tucked in between could be found cheap lithographic
productions of the work of the students and professors of the Paris and
Dusseldorf schools The gaslights under which the students worked at
night were hooded by cheap paper shades of the students own
fashioning and the lower sashes of the windows were smeared with
whitewash or covered with newspapers to concentrate the light During
working hours the drawingboards were propped upon rude easels or
slanted on overturned chairs the students sitting on threelegged
stools

A gentlevoiced earnest wholesouled old manthe one only
instructorpresided over this temple of art He had devoted his whole
life to the sowing of figs and the reaping of thistles and in his old
age was just beginning to see the shoots of a new art forcing their way
through the quickening clay of American civilization Once in awhile
as assistants in this almost hopeless task there would stray into his
classroom some of the painters who unconsciously were founding a
national art and in honor of whom a grateful nation will one day search
the world over for marble white enough on which to perpetuate their
memories men as distinct in their aims methods and results as was
that other group of unknown and despised immortals starving together at
that very time in a French village across the seaand men too
equally deserving of the esteem and gratitude of their countrymen

Oliver knew the names of these distinguished visitors to the Academy
as did all the other members of the Skylarks and he knew their work
The pictures of George Inness Sanford Gifford Kensett McEntee Hart
Eastman Johnson Hubbard Church Casilaer Whittredge and the others
had been frequently discussed around the piano on the top floor at Miss
Teetums and their merits and supposed demerits often hotly contested
He had met Kensett once at the house of Mr Slade and McEntee had been
pointed out to him as he left the theatre one night but few of the
others had ever crossed his path

Of the group Gifford appealed to him most One golden Venice of the
painter which hung in a picturestore always delighted hima stretch
of the Lagoon with a cluster of butterfly sails and a faraway line of
palaces towers and domes lying like a string of pearls on the
horizon There was another of Kensetts a point of rocks thrust out
like a mailed hand into a blue sea and a McEntee of October woods all
brown and gold but the Gifford he had never forgotten nor will anyone
else who has seen it

No wonder then that all his life he remembered that particular night
when a slender darkhaired man in loose gray clothes sauntered into
the classroom and moved around among the easels giving a suggestion
here and a word of praise there for that was the night on which
Professor Cummings touched our young heros shoulder and said Mr
Gifford likes your drawing very much Mr Horna word of praise
which as he wrote to Crocker steadied his uncertain fingers as
nothing else had ever done

The students in his school were from all stations in life young and
old all of them poor and most of them struggling along in kindred
professions and occupationsengravers housepainters lithographers
and woodcarvers Two or three were signpainters One of thesea
bigboned blueeyed young follow who drew in charcoal from the cast
at night and who sketched the ships in the harbor during the daycame
from Kennedy Square or rather from one of the side streets leading out
of it There can still be found over the door of what was once his shop
a weatherbeaten example of his skill in gold letters the product of
his own hand Above the signature is or was some ten years since a
small decorative panel showing a strip of yellow sand a black dot of a
boat and a line of blue sky so true in tone and sure in composition
that when Mr Crocker first passed that way and stood astounded before
itas did Robinson Crusoe over Fridays footprinthe was so overjoyed
to find another artist besides himself in the town that he turned into
the shop and finding only a young mechanic at work said

Go to New York young man and study you have a career before you

The old landscapepainter was a sure prophet little penandink
sketches bearing the initials of this same signpainter now sell for
more than their weight in gold while his larger canvases on the walls
of our museums and galleries hold their place beside the work of the
marinepainters of our own and other times and will for many a day to
come

This exile from Kennedy Square had been the first man to shake Olivers
hand the night he entered the castroom Social distinctions had no
place in this atmosphere it was the fellow who in his work came
closest to the curve of the shoulder or to the poise of the head who
proved in the eyes of his fellowstudents his possession of an
ancestry but the ancestry was one that skipped over the Mayflower and
went straight back to the great Michael and Rembrandt

Im Jack Bedford the signpainter he said heartily You and I
come from the same town and as they grasped each others hands a new
friendship was added to Olivers rapidly increasing list

Olivers seat was next to Fred with Jack Bedford on his right He had
asked to join this group not only because he wanted to be near his two
friends but because he wanted still more to be near the Milo He had
himself selected a certain angle of the head because he had worked from
that same point of sight with Mr Crocker and it had delighted him
beyond measure when the professor allowed him to place his stool so
that he could almost duplicate his earlier drawing His ambition was to
get into the lifeclass and the quickest road he knew lay through a
good cast drawing Every night for a week therefore he had followed
the wonderful lines of the Milos beautiful body which seemed to grow
with warmth under the flare of the overhanging gasjets

These favored life students occupied the room next to the casts Mother
Mulligan in full regalia of apron and broom often sat there as a
model Oliver had recognized her portrait at once so can anyone else
who looks over the earlier studies of half the painters of the time

Oh its you is it Mrs Mulligan herself had cried when she met
Oliver in the hall the young gentleman that saved Miss Margarets
dog Shell be here next week herselfshes gone home for awhile up
into the mountains where her old father and mother live I told her
many times about ye and shell be that pleased to meet ye now that
youre WAN of us

It was delightful to hear her accent the wan Mother Mulligan always
thought the institution rested on her broad shoulders and that the
students were part of her family

The old woman could also have told Oliver of Margarets arrival at the
school and of the impression which she the first and only girl
student made on the night she took her place before an easel But of
the reason of her coming Mrs Mulligan could have told nothing nor why
Margaret had been willing to exchange the comforts of a home among the
New Hampshire hills for the narrow confines of a thirdstory back room
with Mrs Mulligan as housekeeper and chaperon

Fred knew all the details of course and how it had all come about
How a cousin of Margarets who lived on a farm near her fathers had
one day years before left his plough standing in the furrow and
apprenticed himself to a granitecutter in the next town How later on
he had graduated in gravestones and then in basreliefs and finally
had won a medal in Rome for a figure of Hope which was to mark the
grave of a millionnaire at home How when the statue was finished
ready to be set up this cousin had come to Brookfield wearing a
squarecut beard straightout mustaches with needlepoints and funny
shoes with square toes How the girl had been disposed to laugh at him
until he had told her stories of the wonderful cities beyond the sea
and of his life among the painters and sculptors then she showed him
her own drawings searching his face anxiously with her big eyes How
he had been so astounded and charmed by their delicacy and truth that
he had pleaded with her fatheran obstinate old Puritanto send her
to New York to study which the old man refused pointblank to do only
giving his consent at the last when her brother John who had been
graduated from Dartmouth and knew something of the outside world had
joined his voice to that of her mother and her own How when she at
last entered the classroom of the Academy the students had looked
askance at her the usual talk had ceased and for a time there had
been an uncomfortable restraint everywhere until the men found her
laughing quietly at their whispered jokes about her After that the
redheaded girl in blue gingham as she was called had become by
virtue of that spirit of camaraderie which a common pursuit develops
one of us in spirit as well as in occupation

Fred had described it all to Oliver and every night when Oliver came
in from the hall his eyes had wandered over the group of students in
the hope of seeing the strange person A girl studying art or anything
else for that matter seemed to him to be as incongruous as for a boy
to learn dressmaking or for a woman to open a barbershop He knew her
type he said to himself she would be thin and awkward with an
aggressive voice that would jar on the stillness of the room And she
would believe in the doctrines of Elizabeth Cady Stantona name never
mentioned by his mother except apologetically and in a low voiceand
when she became older she would address meetings and become conspicuous
in church and have her name printed in the daily papers

Our heros mind was intent upon these phases of character always to be
found of course in a girl who would unsex herself to the extent that
Miss Grant had done when one night a rich full wellmodulated voice
sounding over his shoulder said

Excuse me but Mother Mulligan tells me that you are Mr Horn Fred
Stones friend I want to thank you for taking care of my poor Juno It
was very good of you I am Margaret Grant

She had approached him without his seeing her He turned quickly to
accost her and immediately lost so much of his breath that he could
only stammer his thanks and the hope that Juno still enjoyed the best
of health But the deepbrown eyes did not waver after acknowledging
his reply nor did the smile about the mouth relax

And Im so glad youve come at last she went on Fred has told me
how you wanted to draw and couldnt I know something myself of what it
is to hunger after a thing and not get it

He was on his feet now the bit of charcoal still between his fingers
his shirtcuff rolled back to give his hand more freedom His senses
were coming back too and there was buoyancy as well as youth in his
face

Yes I do love it said Oliver and his eyes wandered over her
wonderful hair that looked like brown gold illumined by slants of
sunshine and then rested for an instant on her eyes I drew with old
Mr Crocker at home but we only had one cast just the head of the
Milo and I was the only pupil Here everything helps me What are you
at work on Miss Grant

Im doing the Milo too my seat is right in front of yours Oh what
a good beginning and she bent over his drawingboard Why this
cant be your first week and she scanned it closely One minutea
little too full under the chin isnt it She picked up a piece of
chalk and pointed to the shaded lines looking first with halfclosed
eyes at the fullsized cast before them and then at the drawing

Yes I think youre right said Oliver studying the cast also with
halfclosed eyes How will that do and he smudged the shadow with
his fingertip

Just right she answered How well you have the character of the
face Isnt she lovelyI know of nothing so beautiful There is such
a queenly womanly selfpoised simplicity about her

Oliver thought so too and said so with his eyes only it was of a face
framed in browngold that he was thinking and not of one of white
plaster He was touched too by the delicate way in which she had
commended his drawings It was the woman in her that pleased him
just as it had been in Suethat subtle dominating influence which our
fine gentleman could never resist

He shifted his stool a little to one side so that he could see her the
better unobserved while she was arranging her seat and propping up her
board He noticed that although her face was tanned by the weather
her head was set on a neck of singular whiteness Underneath where the
back hair was tucked up his eye caught some delicate filmy curls which
softened the line between her throat and head and shone in the light
like threads of gold The shoulders sloped and the whole fulness of her
figure tapered to a waist firmly held by a leather belt A wholesome
girl he thought to himself and good to look at and with a certain
rhythmic grace about her movements

Her crowning glory though was her hair which was parted over her
forehead and caught in a simple twist behind As the light fell upon it
he observed again how full it was of varying tones like those found in
the crinklings of a satin gownyellowgold one minute and dark brown
the next Oliver wondered how long this marvellous hair might be and
whether it would reach to the floor if it should burst its fastenings
and whether Sir Peter Lely would have loved it too could he have seen
this flood of gold bathing her brow and shoulders

He found it delightful to work within a few feet of her silent as they
had to be for much talking was discountenanced by the professor often
hours passed without any sound being heard in the room but that of the
scraping of the chairs on the bare floor or the shifting of an easel

Two or three times during the evening the old professor emerged from
his room and overlooked his drawing patiently pointing out the defects
and as patiently correcting them He was evidently impressed with
Olivers progress for he remarked to Miss Grant in a low voice

The new student draws wellhe is doing firstrate and passed on
Oliver caught the expression of satisfaction on the professors face
and interpreted it as in some way applying to his work although he did
not catch the words

The old man rarely had to criticise Margarets work The suggestions
made to her came oftener from the students than from the professor
himself or any one of the visiting critics In these criticisms not
only of her own work but of the others everyone took part each
leaving his stool and helping in the discussion when the work of the
night was over Freds more correct eye for instance would be
invaluable to Jack Bedford the exsignpainter who was struggling
with the profile of the Gladiator or Margaret who could detect at a
glance the faintest departure from the lines of the original would
shorten a curve on Olivers drawing or he in turn would advise her
about the depth of a shadow or the spot for a high light

As the nights went by and Oliver studied her the closer the New
England girl became all the more inexplicable to him She was he could
not but admit like no other woman he had ever met certainly not in
his present surroundings She really seemed to belong to some fabled
raceone of the Amazons or Rhine maidens or Norse queens for whom
knights couched their lances It was useless to compare her to any one
of the girls about Kennedy Square for she had nothing in common with
any one of them Was it because she was unhappy among her own people
that she had thus exiled herself from her home or had some loveaffair
blighted her life Or could it be as Fred had suggested that she was
willing to undergo all these discomforts and privations simply for love
of her art As this possible solution of the vexing problem became
established in his mind with the vision of Margaret herself before
him the blood mounted to his cheeks and an uncontrollable thrill of
enthusiasm swept over him He could forgive her anything if this last
motive had really controlled and shaped her life

Had he seen the more closely and with prophetic vision he would have
discerned in this Norse queen with the golden hair the mother of a
long line of daughters who in the days to follow would hang their
triumphant shields beside those of their brothers winning equal
recognition in salon and gallery and conferring equal honor on their
country But Olivers vision was no keener than that of anyone else
about him It was only the turn of Margarets head that caught the
young students eye and the wealth of her browngold hair With the
future he had no concern

What attracted him most of all in this woman who had violated all the
known traditions of Kennedy Square was a certain fearlessness of
manneran independence a perfect ingenuousness and a freedom from
any desire to interest the students in herself When she looked at any
one of them it was never from under drooping eyelids as Sue would
have done nor with that coquettish alluring glance to which he had
always been accustomed She looked straight at them with unflinching
eyes that said I can trust you and WILL He had never seen exactly
that look except in the portrait of his uncles grandmother by Sir
Peter Lelythe picture he had always loved Strange to say too the
eyes of the portrait were Margarets eyes and so was the color of the
hair

No vexed problems entered Margarets head regarding the very engaging
young gentleman who sat behind HER stool He merely represented to her
another studentthat was all the little band was small enough and
she was glad to see the new ones come She noticed it is true certain
unmistakable differencesa peculiar soft cadence in his voice as the
words slipped from his lips without their final gs a certain
deference to herselfstanding until she regained her seat an
attention which she attributed at first to embarrassment over his new
surroundings and to his desire to please She noticed too a certain
grace in his movementsa grace that attracted her especially in the
way with which he used his hands and in the way in which he threw his
head up when he laughed but even these differences ceased to interest
her after the first night of their meeting

But it did not occur to her that he came from any different stock than
the others about her or that his blood might or might not be a shade
bluer than her own What had really impressed her more than anything
elseand this only flashed into her mind while she was looking in the
glass one night at her ownwere his big white teeth white as grains
of corn and the cleanliness of his hands and nails She liked these
things about him Some of the fingers that rested on her drawingboard
were often more like clothespins than fingers and shocked her not a
little some too were stained with acids and one or more with
printers ink that no soap could remove

Before the evening was over Oliver became one of the classroom
appointmentsa young man who sat one stool behind her and was doing
fairly well with his first attempt and who would some day be able to
make a creditable drawing if he had patience and application

At the beginning of the second week a new student appearedor rather
an old one who had been laid up at home with a cold When Oliver
arrived he found him in Margarets seat his easel standing where hers
had been He had a fulllength drawing of the Miloevidently the work
of daysnearly finished on his board Oliver was himself a little
ahead of timeahead of either Margaret or Fred and had noticed the
newcomer when he entered the room being nearly empty Jack Bedford
was already at work

Horn Jack cried and beckoned to Oliversee the beggar in Miss
Grants seat Wont there be a jolly row when she comes in

Margaret entered a moment later her portfolio under her arm and stood
taking in the situation Then she walked straight to her former seat
and said in a firm but kindly tone

This is my place sir Ive been at work here for a week You see my
drawing is nearly done

The young man looked up He toiled all day in a lithographers shop
and these precious nights in the loft were his only glimpses of
happiness He sat without his coat his shirtsleeves liberally smeared
with the colorstains of his trade

Well its my place too I sat here a week before I was taken sick
he said in a slightly indignant tone looking into Margarets face in
astonishment

But if you did continued Margaret you see I am nearly through I
cant take another seat for Ill lose the angle I can finish in an
hour if you will please give me this place tonight You can work just
as well by sitting a few feet farther along

The lithographer without replying turned from her impatiently bent
over his easel picked up a fresh bit of charcoal and corrected a line
on the Milos shoulder So far as he was concerned the argument was
closed

Margaret stood patiently She thought at first he was merely adding a
last touch to his drawing before granting her request

Will you let me have the seat she asked

No he blurted out He was still bending over his drawing his eyes
fixed on the work He did not even look up Im going to stay here
until I finish You know the rules as well as I do I wouldnt take
your seatwhat do you want to take mine for There was no animosity
in his voice He spoke as if announcing a fact

The words had hardly left his lips when there came the sound of a chair
being quickly pushed back and Oliver stood beside Margaret His eyes
were flashing his right shirtcuff was rolled back the bit of
charcoal still between his fingers Every muscle of his body was tense
with anger Margarets quick instinct took in the situation at a
glance She saw Olivers wrath and she knew its cause

Dont Mr Horn pleaseplease she cried putting up her hand
Ill begin another drawing I see now that I took his seat when he was
away although I didnt know it

Oliver stepped past her Get up sir he said and give Miss Grant
her seat What do you mean by speaking so to a lady

The apprenticehis name was Judsonraised his eyes quickly took in
Olivers tense muscular figure standing over him and said with a
contemptuous wave of the hand

Young felleryou go and cool off somewhere or Ill tell the
professor Its none of your business I know the rules and

He never finished the sentencenot that anybody heard He was
floundering on the floor an overturned easel and drawingboard lying
across his body Oliver standing over him with his fists tightly
clenched

Ill teach you how to behave to a lady The words sounded as if they
came from between closed teeth Heres your chair Miss Grant and
with a slight bow he placed the chair before her and resumed his seat
with as much composure as if he had been in his mothers drawingroom
in Kennedy Square

Margaret was so astounded that for a moment she could not speak Then
her voice came back to her I dont want it she cried in a
halffrightened way the tears starting in her eyes It was never
mineI told you so Oh what have you done

Never since the founding of the school had there been such a scene The
students jumped from their chairs and crowded about the group The life
class which were at work in another room startled by the uproar
swarmed out eager to know what had happened and whyand whoand what
for Old Mother Mulligan who had been posing for the class with a
cloak about her fat shoulders and a red handkerchief binding up her
head rushed over to Margaret thinking she had been hurt in some way
until she saw the student on the floor still panting and halfdazed
from the effect of Olivers blow Then she fell on her knees beside him

At this instant Professor Cummings entered and a sudden hush fell upon
the room Judson with the help of Mother Mulligans arm had picked
himself up and would have made a rush at Oliver had not big sack
Bedford stopped him

Whos to blame for this asked the professor looking from one to the
other

Oliver rose from his seat

This man insulted Miss Grant and I threw him out of her chair he
answered quietly

Insulted you cried the professor in surprise and he turned to
Margaret What did he say

I never said a word to her whined Judson straightening his collar
I told her the seat was mine and so it is That wasnt insulting her

Its all a mistake professorMr Horn did not understand protested
Margaret It was his seat not mine He began his drawing first I
didnt know it when I commenced mine I told Mr Horn so

Why did you strike him asked the professor and he turned and faced
Oliver

Because he had no business to speak to her as he did She is the only
lady we have among us and every man in the class ought to remember it
and every man has since Ive been here except this one

There was a slight murmur of applause Judsons early training had been
neglected as far as his manners went and he was not popular

The professor looked searchingly into Olivers eyes and a flush of
pride in the boys pluck tinged his pale cheeks He had once thrown a
fellowstudent out of a window in Munich himself for a similar offence
and old as he was he had never forgotten it

You come from the South Mr Horn I hear he said in a gentler
voice and you are all a hottempered race and often do foolish
things Judson meant no harmhe says so and Miss Grant says so Now
you two shake hands and make up We are trying to learn to draw here
not to batter each others heads

Olivers eyes roved from one to the other he was too astonished to
make further reply He had only done what he knew every other man
around Kennedy Square would have done under similar circumstances and
what any other woman would have thanked him for Why was everybody here
against himeven the girl herself What sort of people were these who
would stand by and see a woman insulted and make no defence or outcry
He could not have looked his father in the face again nor Sue nor
anyone else in Kennedy Square if he had failed to protect her

For a moment he hesitated his eyes searching each face He had hoped
that someone who had witnessed the outrage would come forward and
uphold his act When no voice broke the stillness he crossed the room
and taking the lithographers hand extended rather sullenly answered
quietly If Miss Grant is satisfied I am and peace was once more
restored

Margaret sharpened her charcoals and bent over her drawing She was so
agitated she could not trust herself to touch its surface If I am
SATISFIED she kept repeating to herself The words somehow seemed
to carry a reproach with them Why shouldnt I be satisfied I have no
more rights in the room than the other students about me that is I
thought I hadnt until I heard what he said How foolish for him to
cause all this fuss about nothing and make me so conspicuous

But even as she said the words to herself she remembered Olivers tense
figure and the look of indignation on his face She had never been
accustomed to seeing men take up the cudgels for women There had been
no opportunity perhaps nor cause but even if there had been she
could think of no one whom she had ever met who would have done as much
for her just because she was a woman

A little sob which she could not have explained to herself welled up
to her throat Much as she gloried in her own selfreliance she
suddenly and unexpectedly found herself exulting in a quality
heretofore unknown to herthat quality which had compelled an almost
total stranger to take her part Then the man himself How straight and
strong and handsome he was as he stood looking at Judson and then the
uplifted arm the quick spring and best of all the calm graceful
way in which he had handed her the chair She could not get the picture
out of her mind Last she remembered with a keen sense of pleasure the
chivalrous look in his face when he held out his hand to the man who a
moment before had received its full weight about his throat

She had not regained mastery of herself even when she leaned across her
drawingboard pretending to be absorbed in her work The curves of the
Milo seemed in some strange way to have melted into the semblance of
the outlines of other visions sunk deep in her soul since the days of
her childhoodvisions which for years past had been covered over by
the ice of a cold hard puritanical training that had prevented any
bubbles of sentiment from ever rising to the surface of her heart As
remembrances of these visions rushed through her mind the halfdraped
woman with the face of the Madonna and the soul of the Universal
Mother shining through every line of her beautiful body no longer
stood before her It was a knight in glittering armor now with drawn
sword and visor up beneath which looked out the face of a beautiful
youth aflame with the fire of a holy zeal She caught the flash of the
sun on his breastplate of silver and the sweep of his blade and heard
his clarion voice sing out And then again as she closed her eyes
this calm lifeless cast became a gallant blueeyed prince who knelt
beside her and kissed her fingertips his doffed plumes trailing at
her feet

When the band of students were leaving the rooms that night Margaret
called Oliver to her side and extending her hand said with a direct
simplicity that carried conviction in every tone of her voice and in
which no trace of her former emotions were visible

I hope youll forgive me Mr Horn Im all alone here in this city
and I have grown so accustomed to depending on myself that perhaps I
failed to understand how you felt about it I am very grateful to you
Goodnight

She had turned away before he could do more than express his regret
over the occurrence He wanted to follow her to render her some
assistance to comfort her in some way It hurt him to see her go out
alone into the night He wished he might offer his arm escort her
home make some atonement for the pain he had caused her But there was
a certain proud poise of the head and swift glance of the eye which
held him back

While he stood undecided whether to break through her reserve and join
her he saw Mrs Mulligan come out of the basement stop a passing
stage and helping Margaret in take the seat beside her

I am glad she does not go out alone he said to himself and turned
away




CHAPTER XIII

BELOW MOOSE HILLOCK


It was not long before the bare rooms of the Academy Schoolowing to
the political situation which necessitated the exercise of economies
in every directionbegan to suffer

One night the students found the gas turned out and a small card tacked
on the door of the outer hall It read

SCHOOL CLOSED FOR WANT OF

FUNDS WILL PERHAPS BE

OPENED IN THE AUTUMN


Signs of like character were not unusual in the history of the school
The wonder was considering the vicissitudes through which the Academy
had passed that it was opened at all From the institutions earlier
beginnings in the old house on Bond Street to its flight from the loft
close to Grace Church and then to the abandoned building opposite the
old hotel near Washington Square where Amos Cobb always stayed when he
came to New York and so on down to its own home on Broadway its
history had been one long struggle for recognition and support

This announcement bitter enough as it was to Oliver was followed by
another even more startling when he reached the office next day and
Mr Slade called him into his private room

Mr Horn said his employer motioning Oliver to a seat and drawing
his chair close beside him so that he could lay his hand upon the young
mans knee I am very sorry to tell you that after the first of June
we shall be obliged to lay you off It is not because we are
dissatisfied with your services for you have been a faithful clerk
and we all like you and wish you could stay but the fact is if this
repudiation goes on we will all be ruined I am not going to discharge
you Im only going to give you a holiday for a few months Then if
the warscare blows over we want you back again I appreciate that this
has come as suddenly upon you as it has upon us and I hope you will
not feel offended when in addition to your salary I hand you the
firms check for an extra amount You must not look upon it as a gift
for you have earned every cent of it

These two calamities were duly reported in a tenpage letter to his
mother by our young hero sitting alone as he wrote up in his
skyparlor crooning over his dismal coke fire Was he then to begin
over again the weary tramping of the streets he said to himself And
the future What did that hold in store for him Would the time ever
come when he could follow the bent of his tastes He was getting on so
welleven Miss Grant had said soand it had not interfered with his
work at the store either The check in his pocket proved that

His mothers answer made his heart bound with joy

Take Mr Slade at his word He is your friend and means what he says
Find a place for the summer where you can live cheaply and where the
little money which you now have will pay your way In the fall you can
return to your work Dont think of coming home much as I should like
to put my arms around you I cannot spare the money to bring you here
now as I have just paid the interest on the mortgage Moreover the
whole of Kennedy Square is upset and our house seems to be the centre
of disturbance Your fathers views on slavery are well known and he
is already being looked upon with disfavor by some of our neighbors At
the club the other night he and Judge Bowman had some words which were
very distressing to me Mr Cobb was present and was the only one who
took your fathers part Your father as you may imagine is very
anxious over the political situation but I cannot think our people are
going to fight and kill each other as Colonel Clayton predicts they
will before another year has passed

Olivers heart bounded like a loosened balloon as he laid down his
mothers letter and began pacing the room Neither the political
outlook nor club discussions nor even his mothers hopes and fears
concerned him It was the sudden loosening of all his bonds that
thrilled him Four months to do as he pleased in the dreadful mortgage
out of the way for six months his mother willing and he with money
enough in his pocket to pay his way without calling upon her for a
penny Was there ever such luck All care rolled from his
shoulderseven the desire to see his mother and Sue and those whom he
loved at home was forgotten in the rosy prospect before him

The next day he told Mr Slade of his plans and read him part of his
mothers letter

Very sensible woman your mother his employer answered with his
bluff heartiness Just the thing for you to do and Ive got the very
spot Go to Ezra Pollards He lives up in the mountains at a little
place called East Branch on the edge of a wilderness I fish there
every spring and Ill give you a letter to him

Long before his day of departure came he had dusted out his old hair
trunkthere were other and more modern trunks to be had but Oliver
loved this one because it had been his fathersgathered his painting
materials togetherhis easel brushes leather case and old slouch
hat that he wore to fish in at homeand spent his time counting the
days and hours when he could leave the world behind him and as he
wrote Fred begin to live

He was not alone in this planning for a summer exodus The other
students had indeed all cut their tetherstrings and disappeared long
before his own freedom came Jack Bedford had gone to the coast to live
with a fisherman and paint the surf and Fred was with his people away
up near the lakes As for the lithographers signpainters and
beginners they were spending their evenings somewhere else than in the
old room under the shaded gasjets Even Margaret so Mother Mulligan
told him was up wid her folks somewheres

And she was that brokenhearted she added whin they shut up the
schoolbad cess to em Oh ye would anigh kilt yerself wid grief to
aseen her poor darlint

Where is her home asked Oliver ignoring the tribute to his
sympathetic tendencies He had no reason for asking except that she
had been the only woman among them and he accordingly felt that a
certain courtesy was due her even in her absence

Ive bothered me head loose tryin to remimber but for the soul o
me I cant Its cold enough up there I know to freeze ye solid for
Miss Margaret had wan o her ears nipped last time she was home


And so one fine morning in June with Oliver bursting with happiness
the hair trunk and the leather case and sketching umbrella were thrown
out at a New England waystation in the gray dawn from a train in which
Oliver had spent the night curled up on one of the seats

Just as he had expected the old coach that was to carry him was
waiting beside the platform There was a rush for top seats and Oliver
got the one beside the driver and the trunk and traps were stored in
the boot under the drivers seatit was a very small trunk and took up
but little roomand Marvin cracked his whip and away everybody went
the dogs barking behind and the women waving their aprons from the
porches of the low houses facing the road

And it was a happy young fellow who filled his lungs with the fresh air
of the morning and held on to the iron rail of the top seat as they
bumped over the Thank ye marms and who asked the driver innumerable
questions which it was part of the noted whips duty and always his
pleasure to answer The squirrels darted across the road as if to get a
look at the enthusiast and then ran for their lives to escape the
wheels and the crows heard the rumble and rose in a body from the
sparse cornfields for a closer view and the big trees arched over his
head cooling the air and casting big shadows and even the sun kept
peeping over the edge of the hills from behind some jutting rock or
clump of pines or hemlock as if bent on lighting up his face so that
everybody could see how happy he was

As the day wore on and the coach rattled over the big open bridge that
spanned the rushing mountainstream Olivers eye caught far up the
vista the little dent in the line of blue that stood low against the
sky The driver said this was the Notch and that the big hump to the
right was Moose Hillock and that Ezras cabin nestled at its feet and
was watered by the rushing stream only it was a tiny little brook away
up there that anybody could step over

Taint biggern yer body where it starts out fresh up in them
mountings the driver said touching his leaders behind their ears
with the lash of his whip Runs clean round Ezras ands jest as
chuckfull o trout be gosh as a hive is o bees

And the swing and the freedom of it all No officehours to keep no
boxes to nail up and roll outnothing but sweetness and cool draughts
of fresh mountainair and big trees that he wanted to get down and
hug and jolly laughing brooks that ran out to meet him and called to
him as he trotted along or as the horses did which was the same
thing he being part of the team

And the day Had there ever been such another And the sky too filled
with soft white clouds that sailed away over his headthe little ones
far in advance and already crowding up the Notch which was getting
nearer every hour

And Marvin the driverwhat a character he was and how quaint his
speech And the cabins by the road with their trim fences and winters
wood piled up so neatly under the shedsall so different from any
which he had seen at the South and all so charming and exhilarating

Never had he been so happy

And why not Twentythree and in perfect health without a care and
for the first time in all his life doing what he wanted most to do
with opportunities opening every hour for doing what he believed he
could do best

Oh for some planet where such young saplings can grow without
hinderance from the ignorant and the unsympathetic where they can
reach out for the sun on all sides and stretch their long arms skyward
where each vine can grow as it would in all the luxuriance of its
nature free from the pruningknife of criticism and the straitlaced
trellis of conventionalitya planet on which the Puritan with his
creeds customs fads issues and dogmas and the Cavalier with his
traditions and timehonored notions never sat foot Where every round
peg fits a round hole and men toil with a will and with unclouded
brows because their hearts find work for their hands and each days
task is a joy

If the road and the country on each side of it and the giant trees
now that they neared the mountains and the deep ravines and busy
hurrying brooks had each inspired some exclamation of joy from Oliver
the first view of Ezras cabin filled him so full of uncontrollable
delight that he could hardly keep his seat long enough for Marvin to
rein in his horses and get down and swing back the gate that opened
into the pasture surrounding the house

Got a boarder for ye Ezra Marvin called to Olivers prospective
host who had come down to meet the stage and get his empty
butterpails Then in a lower tone Sezs hes a painter chap and
that Mr Slade sent him up Hes goin to bunk in with ye all summer
he sezs Seems like a knowin happy kind er young feller

They were pulling the pails from the rear boot each one tied up in a
wheatsack with a card marked Ezra Pollard sewed on the outside to
distinguish it from the property of other East Branch settlers up and
down the road

Oliver had slipped from his seat and was tugging at his hair trunk He
did not know that the long thin slabsided old fellow in a slouch
hat hickory shirt crossed by one suspender and heavy cowhide boots
was his prospective landlord He supposed him to be the hired man and
that he would find Mr Pollard waiting for him in the little
sittingroom with the windows full of geraniums that looked so inviting
and picturesque

Marve sez youre lookin fur me Come along Glad ter see ye

Are you Mr Pollard His surprise not only marked the tones of his
voice but the expression of his face

No jes Ezry Pollard thats all Hope Mr Slades up and hearty


Mr Slade was never so up and hearty as was Oliver that next morning

Up with the sun he was and hearty as a young buck out of a bed of
mountainmoss

Time to be movin aint it came Ezra Pollards voice shouting up
the unpainted staircase Hanks drawed a bucket out here at the well
for ye to wash in Neednt worry about no towel Samanthys got one fur
ye but ye kin bring yer comb

At the sound of Ezras voice Oliver sprang from the coarse straw
mattressit had been as eiderdown to his stagejolted bodypushed
open the wooden blind and peered out The sun was peeping over the edge
of the Notch and looking with wide eyes into the saucershaped valley
in which the cabin stood The fogs which at twilight had stolen down to
the meadows and had made a night of it now startled into life by the
warm rays of the sun were gathering up their skirts of shredded mist
and tiptoeing back up the hillside looking over their shoulders as
they fled The fresh smell of the new corn watered by the night dew and
the scent of pine and balsam from the woods about him filled the
morning air Songs of birds were all about a robin on a fencepost and
two larks high in air singing as they flew

Below him bounding from rock to rock ran the brook laughing in the
sunlight and tossing the spray high in the air in a mad frolic Across
this swirling line of silver lay a sparse meadow strewn with rock
plotted with squares of last years cropspotatoes stringbeans and
cabbages and now combed into straight green lines of early buckwheat
and turnips Beyond this a ragged pasture fenced with blackened
stumps from which came the tinkle of cowbells and farther on the
grim silent forestmiles and miles of forest seamed by a single road
leading to Moose Hillock and the great Stone Face

Oliver slipped into his clothes ran down the stairs and out into the
fresh morning air As he walked toward the well his eyes caught sight
of Hanks bucket tilted on one edge of the wellcurb over which hung
the big sweep its lower end loaded with stone On the platform stood a
wooden bench sloppy with the drippings of the watersoaked pail This
bench held a tin basin and half a bar of rosin soap Beside it was a
single post sprouting hickory prongs on which were hung as many
cleanly scoured milkpails glittering in the sun On this post Hank had
nailed a threecornered piece of lookingglassHank had a sweetheart
in the village belowa necessity and useful luxury he told Oliver
afterward in slickin yerself up fer meals

Once out in the sunshine Oliver with the instinct of the painter
suddenly roused looked about him He found that the cabin which had
delighted him so in the glow of the afternoon was even more enchanting
in the light of the morning To the plain everyday practical man it
was but a long box with a door in the middle of each side front and
backone opening into a sittingroom which again opened into a
bedroom in which Ezra and his wife slept with the windows choked with
geraniums their red cheeks pressed against the small panes and the
other opening into a kitchen connecting with a pantry and a long
rambling woodshed To our young Raphael the simple cabin from its
homely sagging door to its brokenbacked roof covered with rotting
shingles was nothing less than an enchanted palace

He remembered the shingles He had reached up in the night and touched
them with his hands He remembered too the fragrance they gave outa
hot dry spicy smell He remembered also the dried apples spread out
on a board beside his bed and the broken spinningwheel and the
wasps nest He was sure too there were many other fascinating relics
stored away in this old attic But for the sputtering tallowcandle
which the night before was nearly burnt out he would have examined
everything else about him before he went to sleep

Then his eye fell on the woodshed and the huge pile of chips that
Hanks axe had made in supplying Samanthys stove and the rickety
clayplastered buggy and buckboard that had never known water since the
day of their birth And the two muskrat skins nailed to the outside
plankingspoils of the milldam a mile below

Yes he could paint here

With a thrill of delight surging through him he rolled up his sleeves
tilted the bucket filled the basin with icecold water which Hank had
drawn for him a courtesy only shown a stranger guest and plunging in
his hands and face dashed the water over his head Samanthy
meanwhile in sunbonnet and straightupanddown calico dress had come
out with the towelhalf a saltsack washed and rewashed to phenomenal
softness an ideal towel is a saltsack to those who know Then came
the rubbing until his flesh was aglow and the parting of the wet hair
with the help of Hanks glass and with a toss of a stray lock back
from his forehead Oliver went in to breakfast

It fills me with envy when I think of that first toilet of Olivers I
too have had just such morning dipsone in Como with the great
cypresses standing black against the glow of an Italian dawn another
in the Lido at sunrise my gondolier circling about me as I swam still
a third in Stamboul with the long slants of light piercing the gloom
of the stone dome above mebut oh the smell of the pines and the
great sweep of openness with the mountains looking down and the sun
laughing and the sparkle and joyousness of it all Ah what a lucky
dog was this Oliver

And the days that followed Each one a delighteach one happier than
the one before The sun seemed to soak into his blood the strength of
the great hemlocks with their giant uplifted arms seemed to have found
its way to his muscles He grew stronger more supple He could follow
Hank all day now tramping the brook or scaling the sides of Bald Face
its cheeks scarred with thunderbolts And with this joyous life there
came a light into his eyes a tone in his voice a spring and buoyancy
in his step that brought him back to the days when he ran across
Kennedy Square and had no care for the day nor thought for the morrow
Before the week was out he had covered half a dozen canvases with
pictures of the house as he saw it that first morning bathed in the
sunshine of the brook the sweep of the Notch and two or three
individual trees that he had fallen in love witha ragged birch in
particulara tramp of a birch with its toes out of its shoes and its
bark coat in tatters

Before the second week had arrived he had sought the main stageroad
and had begun work on a big hemlock that stood sentinel over a turn in
the highway There was a schoolhouse in the distance and a logbridge
under which the brook plunged Here he settled himself for serious work

He was so engrossed that he had not noticed the schoolchildren who had
come up noiselessly from behind and were looking in wonder at his
drawings Presently a child who in her eagerness had touched his
shoulder broke the stillness in apology

Say Mister theres a lady comes to school every day Shes a painter
too and drawed Sissy Mathers

Oliver glanced at the speaker and the group about her wished them all
goodmorning and squeezed a fresh tube on his palette He was too much
absorbed in his work for prolonged talk The child emboldened by his
cheery greeting began again the others crowding closer She drawed
the bridge too and me and Jennie Waters was sitting on the railshes
awful nice

Oliver looked up smiling

Whats her name

I dont know Teacher calls her Miss Margaret but theres more to it
She comes every year

Oliver bent over his easel drew out a line brush from the sheaf in his
hand caught up a bit of yellow ochre from his palette and touched up
the shadow of the birch All the women painters must be Margarets he
said to himself Then he fell to wondering what had become of her since
the school closed He had always felt uncomfortable over the night when
he had defended the redheaded girl in blue gingham as she was
called by the students She had placed him in the wrong by
misunderstanding his reasons for serving her The students had always
looked upon him after that as a quarrelsome person when he was only
trying to protect a woman from insult He could not find it in his
heart to blame her but he wished that it had not happened As these
thoughts filled his mind he became so absorbed that the childrens
goodby failed to reach his ear

That day Hank had brought him his luncheontwo ears of hot corn in a
tin bucket four doughnuts and an applethe corn in the bottom of the
bucket and the doughnuts and apple on top He could have walked home
for his midday meal for he was within sound of Samanthys dinnerhorn
but he liked it better this way

Leaving his easel standing in the road he had waved his hand in
goodby to Hank picked up the bucket and had crept under the shadow of
the bridge to eat his luncheon He had finished the corn thrown the
cobs to the fish and was beginning on the doughnuts when a step on
the planking above him caused him to look up A girl in a
tamoshanter cap was leaning over the rail The sun was behind her
throwing her face into shadowso blinding a light that Oliver only
caught the nimbus of fluffy hair that framed the dark spot of her head
Then came a voice that sent a thrill of surprise through him

Why Mr Horn Who would have thought of meeting you here

Oliver was on his feet in an instanta halfeaten doughnut in one
hand his slouch hat in the other With this he was shading his eyes
against the glare of the sun He was still ignorant of who had spoken
to him

I beg your pardon IWHY Miss Grant The words burst from his lips
as if they had been fired from a gun You here

Yes I live only twenty miles away and I come here every year Where
are you staying

At Pollards

Why thats the next clearing from mine Im at old Mrs Tafts Oh
please dont leave your luncheon

Oliver had bounded up the bank to a place beside her

How good it is to find you here I am so glad He WAS glad he meant
every word of it Mrs Mulligan said you lived up in the woods but I
had no idea it was in these mountains Have you had your luncheon

No not yet and Margaret held up a basket Look and she raised
the lid Elderberry pie two pieces of cake

Good and I have three doughnuts and an apple I swallowed every grain
of my hot corn like a greedy Jack Horner or you should have half of
it Come down under the bridge its so cool there and he caught her
hand to help her down the bank

She followed him willingly She had seen him greet Fred and Jack
Bedford and even the gentle Professor with just such outbursts of
affection and she knew there was nothing especially personal to her in
it all It was only his way of saying he was glad to see her

Oliver laid the basket and tin can on a flat stone that the spring
freshets had scoured clean spread his brown corduroy jacket on the
pebbly beach beside it and with a laugh and the mock gesture of a
courtier conducted her to the head of his improvised table Margaret
laughed and returned the bow stepping backward with the sweep of a
great lady and settled herself beside him In a moment she was on her
knees bending over the brook her hands in the water the
tamoshanter beside her She must wash her hands she saidthere
was a whole lot of chrome yellow on her fingersand she held them up
with a laugh for Olivers inspection Oliver watched her while she
dried and bathed her shapely hands smoothed the hair from her temples
and tightened the coil at the back of her head which held all this
flood of gold in check then he threw himself down beside her waiting
until she should serve the feast

As he told her of his trip up the valley and the effect it made upon
him and how he had never dreamed of anything so beautiful and how
good the Pollards were and what he had painted and what he expected to
paint talking all the time with his thumb circling about as if it was
a bit of charcoal and the air it swept through but a sheet of Whatmans
best her critical eye roamed over his figure and costume She had
caught in her first swift comprehensive glance from over the
bridgerail the loose jacket and broadbrimmed planters hat around
which with his love of color Oliver had twisted a spray of nasturtium
blossoms and leaves culled from the gardenpatch that morning but now
that he was closer she saw the color in his cheeks and noticed with a
suppressed smile the slight mustache curling at the ends a new
feature since the school had closed She followed too the curves of the
broad chest and the muscles outlined through his shirt She had never
thought him so strong and graceful nor so handsome The smile came to
the surface nowan approving admiring smile It was the
mountainclimbing no doubt she said to herself and the openair life
that had wrought the change

With a laugh and toss of her head she unpacked her own basket and laid
her contribution to the feast on the flat rockthe pie on a green
dockleaf which she reached over and pulled from the waters edge and
the cake on the pink napkinthe only sign of city luxury in her
outlay Olivers eye meanwhile wandered over her figure and costumea
costume he had never seen before on any living woman certainly not any
woman around Kennedy Square The cloth skirt came to her ankles which
were covered with yarn stockings and her feet were encased in shoes
that gave him the shivers the soles being as thick as his own and the
leather as tough Sue Clayton would have died with laughter had she
seen those shoes Her blouse was of gray flannel belted to the waist
by a cotton saddlegirthwhite and redand as broad as her hand The
tamoshanter was coarse and rough evidently homemade and not at
all like McFudds which was as soft as the back of a kitten and
without a seam

Then his eyes sought her face He noticed how brown she wasand how
ruddy and healthy How red the lipsred as mountainberries and back
of them big white teethwhite as peeled almonds He caught the line of
the shoulders and the round of the full arm and tapering wrist and the
small wellshaped hand Queer clothes he said to himselfbut the
girl inside is all right

Sitting under the shadow of the old bridge on the main highway each
weighed and balanced the other even as they talked aloud of the
Academy School and the pupils and the dear old Professor whom they
both loved They discussed the prospect of its doors being opened the
next winter They talked of Mrs Mulligan and the old Italian who sold
peanuts and whose head Margaret had painted and of Jack Bedford and
Fred Stonethe dearest fellow in the worldand last years
picturesespecially Churchs Niagara the sensation of the year and
Whittredges Mountain Brook and every other subject their two busy
brains could rake and scrape up exceptand this subject strange to
say was the only one really engrossing their two mindsthe
overturning of Mr Judsons body on the artschool floor and the
upsetting of Miss Grants mind for days thereafter Once Oliver had
unintentionally neared the dangerline by mentioning the lithographers
name but Margaret had suddenly become interested in the movements of a
chipmunk that had crept down for the crumbs of their luncheon and with
a womans wit had raised her finger to her lips to command silence lest
he should be frightened off

They painted no more that afternoon When the shadows began to fall in
the valley they started up the road picking up Olivers easel and
trapboth had stood unmolested and would have done so all summer with
perfect safetyand Oliver walked with Margaret as far as the bars that
led into Tafts pasture There they bade each other goodnight
Margaret promising to be ready in the morning with her big easel and a
fresh canvas which Oliver was to carry when they would both go
sketching together and make a long blessed summer day of it

That night Olivers upraised restless hands felt the shingles over his
head more than once before he could get to sleep He had not thought he
could be any happierbut he was Margarets unexpected appearance had
restored to him that something which the old life at home had always
yielded He was never really happy without the companionship of a
woman and this he had not had since leaving Kennedy Square Those he
had met on rare occasions in New York were either too conventional or
selfconscious or they seemed to be offended at his familiar Southern
ways This one was so sensible and companionable and so appreciative
and sympathetic He felt he could say anything to her and she would
know what he meant Perhaps too by and by she would understand just
why he had upset a man who had been rude to her

Margaret lay awake toonot longnot more than five minutes perhaps
Long enough however to wish she was not so sunburnt and that she had
brought her other dress and a pair of gloves and a hat instead of this
rough mountainsuit Long enough too to recall Olivers standing
beside her on the bridge with his big hat sweeping the ground the
color mounting to his cheeks and that joyous look in his eyes

Was he really glad to see me she said to herself as she dropped off
into dreamland or is it his way with all the women he meets I
wonder too if he protects them all


And so ended a day that always rang out in Olivers memory with a note
of its own

These dreams under the shingles What would life be without them




CHAPTER XIV

UNDER A BARK SLANT


The weeks that followed were rare ones for Margaret and Oliver

They painted all day and every day

The little schoolchildren posed for them and so did the prim
schoolmistress a girl of eighteen in spectacles with hair cut short
in the neck And old Jonathan Gordon the fisherman posed too with a
string of trout in one hand and a long pole cut from a sapling in the
other And once our two young comrades painted the milldam and the
millOliver doing the first and Margaret the last and Baker the
miller caught them at it and insisted in all sincerity that some of
the money which the pictures brought must come to him if the report
were true that painters did get money for pictures Its my mill
aint itand I aint give no permission to take no part of it away
Hev I

They climbed the ravines Margaret carrying the luncheon and Oliver the
sketchtraps they built fires of birchbark and roasted potatoes or
made tea in the little earthen pot that Mrs Taft loaned her Or they
waited for the stage in the early morning and went half a dozen miles
down the valley to paint some waterfall Oliver had seen the day he
drove up with Marvin or a particular glimpse of Moose Hillock from the
covered bridge or various shady nooks and sunlit vistas that remained
fastened in Olivers mind and the memory of which made him unhappy
until Margaret could enjoy them too

The fact that he and a woman whom he had known but a little while were
roaming the woods together quite as a brother and sister might have
done never occurred to him If it had it would have made no
difference nor could he have understood why any barrier should have
been put up between them He had been taking care of girls in that same
way all his life Every woman was a sister to him so far as his
reverent protection over her went The traditions of Kennedy Square had
taught him this

As the joyous weeks flew by even the slight reserve which had marked
their earlier intercourse began to wear off It was Oliver and
Margaret now and even Ollie and Madge when they forgot
themselves and each other in their work

To Margaret this free and happy life together seemed natural enough
She had decided on the day of their first meeting that Olivers
interest in her was due wholly to his love of companionship and not
because of any special liking he might feel for her Had she not seen
him quite as cordial and as friendly to the men he knew Satisfied on
this point Oliver began to take the place of a brother or cousin or
some friend of her youth who loved another woman perhaps and was
therefore safe against all contingencies while she gave herself up to
the enjoyment of that rare luxurythe rarest that comes to a
womandaily association with a man who could be big and strong and
sympathetic and yet ask nothing in return for what she gave him but
her companionship and confidence

In the joy of this new intercourse and with his habit of trusting
implicitly everyone whom he lovedman woman or childOliver long
before the first month was over had emptied his heart to Margaret as
completely as he had ever done to Miss Clendenning He had told her of
Sue and of Miss Lavinias boudoir and of Mr Crocker and his pictures
and of his poor fathers struggles and his dear mothers determination
to send him from homenot about the mortgage that was his mothers
secret not his ownand of the great receptions given by his Uncle
Tilghman and of all the other wonderful doings in Kennedy Square

She had listened at first in astonishment and then with impatience
Many of the things that seemed so important to him were valueless in
her more practical eyes Instead of a regime which ennobled those who
enjoyed its privileges she saw only a slavish devotion to wornout
traditions and a clannish provincialism which proved to her all the
more clearly the narrowmindedness of the people who sustained and
defended them So far as she could judge the qualities that she deemed
necessary in the makeup of a robust life instinct with purpose and
accomplishment seemed to be entirely lacking in Kennedy Square
formulas She saw too with a certain undefined pain that Olivers
mind had been greatly warped by these influences Mrs Horns
domination over him strange to say greatly disturbed her why she
could not tell She must be a proud aristocratic woman she had said
to herself after one of Olivers outbursts of enthusiasm over his
mother wedded to patrician customs and with no consideration for
anyone outside of her class

And yet none of these doubts and criticisms made the summer days less
enjoyable

One bright beautiful morning when the sky was a turquoise the air a
breath of heaven and the brooks could be heard laughing clear out on
the main road Oliver and Margaret who had been separated for some
days while she paid a visit to her family at home started to find a
camp that Hank had built the winter before as a refuge while he was
hunting deer They had reached a point in the forest where two paths
met when Margarets quick ear caught the sound of a human voice and
she stopped to listen

Quick she criedget behind these spruces or he will see us and
stop singing Its old Mr Burton He is such a dear He spends his
summers here I often meet him and he always bows to me so politely
although he doesnt know me

A man of sixtybareheaded dressed in a gray suit with his collar
and coat over his arm and hands filled with wildflowers was passing
leisurely along singing at the top of his voice Once he stopped and
bending over picked a bunch of mountainberries which he tucked into a
buttonhole of his flannel shirt just before disappearing in a turn of
the path

Oliver looked after him for a moment He had caught the look of sweet
serenity on the idlers face and the air of joyousness that seemed to
linger behind him like a perfume and it filled him with delight

There Margaret thats what I call a happy man Ill wager you he has
never done anything all his life but that which he loved to dojust
lives out here and throws his heart wide open for every beautiful thing
that can crowd into it Thats the kind of a man I want to be Oh Im
so glad I saw him

Margaret was silent She was walking ahead her staff in her hand the
fallen trunks and heavy underbrush making it difficult for them to
walk abreast

Do you think that he never had to work to be able to enjoy himself as
he does she asked over her shoulder with a toss of her head

Perhapsbut he loved what he was doing

No he didnthe hated ithated it all his life The tone carried a
touch of defiance that was new to Oliver He stepped quickly after her
with a sudden desire to look into her face Ten minutes at least had
passed during which he had seen only the back of her head

Margaret heard his step behind her and quickened her own Something was
disturbing the joyousness of our young Diana this lovely summer morning

What did the old fellow do for a living Margaret Oliver called
still trying to keep up with Margarets springing step

Sold lard and provisions and over the counter too she answered
with a note almost of exultation in her voice she was thinking of Mrs
Horn and Kennedy Square Mrs Taft knows him and used to send him her
bacon He retired rich some years ago and now he can sing all day if
he wants to

It was Olivers turn to be silent The tones of Margarets voice had
hurt him For some minutes he made no reply Then wheeling suddenly he
sprang over a mosscovered trunk that blocked her path stepped in
front of her and laid his hand on her shoulder

Not offended Margaret are you he asked looking earnestly into her
eyes

Nowhat nonsense Of course not Why do you ask

Well somehow you spoke as if you were

No I didnt I only said how dear Mr Burton was and he IS How
silly you are Comewe will be late for the camp

They both walked on in silence now he ahead this time brushing aside
the thick undergrowth that blocked the path

The exultant tones in her voice which had hurt her companion and which
had escaped her unconsciously still rang in her own ears She felt
ashamed of the outburst now as she watched him cutting the branches
ahead of her and thought how gentle and tender he had always been to
her and how watchful over her comfort She wondered at the cause of her
frequent discontent Then like an evil spirit that would not down
there arose in her mind as she walked on the picture she had formed
of Kennedy Square She thought of his mothers imperious nature
absorbing all the love of his heart and inspiring and guiding his every
action and emotion of the unpractical fathera dreamer and an
enthusiast the worst possible example he could have of the false
standards and class distinctions which had warped his early life and
which were still dominating him With an abrupt gesture of impatience
she stood still in the path and looked down upon the ground An angry
flush suffused her face

What a stupid fool you are Margaret Grant she burst out
impatiently What are Kennedy Square and the whole Horn family to you

Olivers halloo brought her to consciousness

Heres that slant Margaretoh such a lovely spot Hurry up

The slant had been built between two great trees and stood on a
little mound of earth surrounded by beds of velvety green mosshuge
green winding sheets under which lay the bodies of many giant pines
and hemlocks The shelter was made of bark and bedded down with boughs
of sweetbalsam Outside on a birch sapling supported by two forked
sticks hung a rusty kettle Beneath the rude spit halfhidden by the
growth of the summer lay the embers of the abandoned campfires that
had warmed and comforted Hank and his companions the preceding winter

Oliver raked the charred embers from under the tangled vines that hid
them while Margaret peeled the bark from a silverbirch for kindling
Soon a curl of blue smoke mounted heavenward hung suspended over the
treetops and then drifted away in scarfs of silver haze dimming the
forms of the giant trunks

Our young enthusiast watched the Diaz of a wood interior turn slowly
into a Corot and with a cry of delight was about to unstrap his own
and Margarets sketchingkits when the sun was suddenly blotted out by
a heavy cloud and the quick gloom of a mountainstorm chilling the
sunlit vista to a dull slate gray settled over the forest Oliver
walked over to the brook for a better view of the sky and came back
bounding over the mosscovered logs as he ran There was not a moment
to lose if they would escape being drenched to the skin

The outlook was really serious Old Bald Face had not only lost his
smilea marvelously happy one with the early sun upon his wrinkled
countenancebut he had put on his judgmentcap of gray clouds and had
begun to thunder out his disapproval of everything about him Moose
Hillock evidently heard the challenge for he was answering back in the
murky darkness Soon a cold raw wind which had been asleep in the
hills for weeks awoke with a snarl and started down the gorge Then
the little leaves began to quiver the big trees to groan in their
anxiety not knowing what the will of the wind would be and the merry
little waves that had chased each other all the morning over the sunny
shallows of the brook grew ashy pale as they looked up into the angry
face of the StormGod and fled shivering to the shore

Oliver whipped out his knife stripped the heavy outer bark from a
white birch and before the dashing rain could catch up with the wind
had repaired the slant so as to make it watertightHank had taught
him thisthen he started another great fire in front of the slant and
threw fresh balsam boughs on the bed that had rested Hanks tired
limbs and he and Margaret crept in and were secure

The equanimity of Margarets temper temporarily disturbed by her vivid
misconception of Kennedy Square was restored The dry shelter the
warm fire the sense of escape from the elements all filled her heart
with gladness Never since the day she met him on the bridge had she
been so happy Again as when Oliver championed her in the old Academy
schoolroom there stole over her a vague sense of pleasure in being
protected

Isnt it jolly she said as she sat hunched up beside him Im as
dry as a bone not a drop on me

Oliver was even more buoyant There was something irresistibly cosey
and comfortable in the shelter which he had provided for hersomething
of warmth and companionship and rest But more intensely enjoyable than
all was the thought that he was taking care of a woman for the first
time in his life as it seemed to him And in a house of his own
making and in a place too of his own choosing surrounded by the big
trees that he loved He had even outwitted the elementsthe wind and
the rain and the chillin her defence Old Moose Hillock could bellow
now and White Face roar and the wind and rain vent their wrath but
Margaret close beside him would still be warm and dry and safe

By this time she had hung her tamoshanter and jacket on a nail that
she had found in the bark over her head and was arranging her hair

Its just like life Oliver isnt it she said as she tightened the
coil in her neck All we want after all is a place to get into out
of the storm and wet not a big place either

What kind of a place He was on his knees digging a little trench
with his knife piling up the moist earth in miniature embankments so
that the dripping from the roof would not spatter this Princess of his
whom he had saved from the tempest outside

Oh any kind of a place if you have people youre fond of Id love a
real studio somewhere and a few things hung aboutsome old Delft and
one or two bits of stuffand somebody to take care of me

Oliver shifted his pipe in his mouth and looked up Would she with all
her independence really like to have someone take care of her He had
seen no evidence of it

Who he asked He had never heard her mention anybodys namebut
then she had not told him everything

He had dropped his eyes again finishing the drain and flattening the
boughs under her to make the seat the easier

Oh some old woman perhaps like dear old Mrs Mulligan There was
no coquetry in her tone She was speaking truthfully out of her heart

Anything more Olivers voice had lost its buoyancy now The pipe was
upside down the ashes falling on his shirt

Yeslots of portraits to paint

And a medal at the Salon asked Oliver brushing off the waste of his
pipe from his coatsleeve

Yes I dont mind if my pictures deserve it and she looked at him
quizzically while a sudden flash of humor lightened up her face What
would you want Mr Happygolucky if you had your wish

I Madge dear he exclaimed with a sudden outburst of tenderness
raising his body erect and looking earnestly into her eyes which were
now within a hands breadth of his own She winced a little but it did
not offend her nor did she move an inch Oh I dont know what I
want What I want I suppose is what I shall never have little girl

She wasnt his little girl or anybody elses she thought to
herselfshe was firmly convinced of that fact It was only one of his
terms of endearment He had them for everybodyeven for Hank and for
Mrs Taftwhom he called Taffy and who loved to hear him say it
and she old enough to be his grandmother She stole a look into his
face There was a cloud over it a slight knitting of the brows and a
pained expression about the mouth that were new to her

Id like to be a painter he continued but mother would never
consent As he spoke he sank back from her slowly his knees still
bent under him Then he added with a sigh She wouldnt think it
respectable Anything but a painter she says

Margaret looked out through the forest and watched a woodpecker at work
on the dry side of a hollow trunk the side protected from the driving
rain

And you would give up your career because she wants it How do you
know shes right about it And whos to suffer if shes wrong Be a
painter Oliver if you want to Your mother cant coddle you up
forever No mother should Do what you can do best and to please
yourself not somebody else and then she laughed lightly as if to
break the force of her words

Oliver looked at her in indignation that anyoneeven Margaretshould
speak so of his mother It was the first time in all his life that he
had heard her name mentioned without the profound reverence it
deserved Then a sense of the injustice of her words took possession of
him as the solemn compact he had made with his mother not to be a
burden on her while the mortgage was unpaid rose in his mind This
thought and Margarets laugh softened any hurt her words had given him
although the lesson that they were intended to teach lingered in his
memory for many days thereafter

You would not talk that way Madge if you knew my dear mother he
said quietly There is nothing in her life she loves better than me
She doesnt want me to be a painter because He stopped fearing she
might not understand his answer

Go onwhy not The laugh had faded out of her voice now and a tone
almost of defiance had taken its place

She says it is not the profession of a gentleman he answered sadly
I do not agree with her but she thinks so and nothing can shake her

If those are her opinions I wonder what she would think of ME There
was a slight irritation in her voicesomehow she always became
irritable when Oliver spoke of his mother She was ashamed of it but
it was true

All his anger was gone now Whatever opinion the world might have on
any number of things there could be but one opinion of Madge She
would LOVE you little girl he burst out as he laid his hand on her
armthe first time he had ever touched her with any show of affection
Youd make her love you She never saw anybody like you before and
she never will That you are an artist wouldnt make any difference
Its not the same with you Youre a woman

The girls eyes again sought the woodpecker It was stabbing away with
all its might driving its beak far into the yielding bark It seemed
in some way to represent her own mood After a moments thought she
said thoughtfully as she rested her head on the edge of the slant

Ollie what is a gentleman She knew she thought but she wanted him
to define it

My father is one he said positively and so is yours and he
looked inquiringly into her face

That depends on your standard I dont know your father but I do
mine and from what you have told me about yours I think they are about
as different as two men can be Answer my questionwhat is a
gentleman She was leaning over a little and tucking a chip under her
toes to keep the water away from her shoes Her eyes sought his again

A gentleman Madgewhy you know what a gentleman is He is a man
well born well educated and well bred Thats the standard at
homeat least thats my mothers Fathers standard is the same only
he puts it in a different way He says a gentleman is a man who
tolerates other peoples mistakes and who sympathizes with other
peoples troubles

Anything else She was searching his face now There were some things
she wanted to settle in her own mind

I dont think of anything else Madge deardo you He was really
dismissing the question His thoughts were on something elsethe way
her hair curled from under her worsted cap and the way her pink ears
nestled close to her head especially the little indents at each corner
of her mouth He liked their modelling

And so according to your mothers and fathers ideas and those of all
your aristocratic people at home Hank here could not be a gentleman if
he tried

The idea was new to Oliver He had become conscious now What had
gotten into Margaret today

Hankno certainly not How could he

By BEING a gentleman Mr Aristocrat Not in clothes mind younor
money nor furniture nor wines nor carriages but in HEART Think a
moment Ollie and her eyes snapped Hank finds a robin that has
tumbled out of its nest and spends half a day putting it back Hank
follows you up the brook and sees you try to throw a fly into a pool
and he knows just how awkwardly you do it for hes the best fisherman
in the woodsand yet you never see a smile cross his face nor does he
ever speak of it behind your backnot even to me Hank walks across
Moose Hillock to find old Jonathan Gordon to tell him he has some big
trout in Loon Pond so that the old man can have the fun of catching
them and selling them afterward to the new hotel in the Notch He has
walked twentyfour miles when he gets back Do these things make Hank a
gentleman or not

Then you dont believe in Sir Walter Raleigh Miss Democrat simply
because he was a lord

Yesbut I always thought he wore his old cloak that day on purpose
so he could be made an earl And a ripple of laughter escaped her lips

Oliver laughed too sprang to his feet and held out his hands so as to
lift her up None of these finedrawn distinctions really interested
himcertainly not on this day when he was so happy Why he wondered
should she want to discuss theories and beliefs and creeds with the
beautiful forest all about and the sky breaking overhead

Well youve walked over mine many a time Miss Queen Elizabeth and
you havent decorated me yet nor made me an earl nor anything else for
it and Im not going to forgive you either and he rose to his feet
Look Madge look he cried and sprang out into the path pointing
to the sunshine bursting through the treesthe storm had passed as
suddenly as it had come Isnt it glorious Come here quick Dont
wait a minute I should try to get that with Naples yellow and a little
chromewhat do you think he asked when she stood beside him half
closing his eyes to get the effect the better

Margaret looked at him curiously for a moment She did not answer I
cannot fasten his mind on anything in which I am interested she said
to herself with a sigh nor shall I ever overcome these prejudices
which seem to be part of his very life

She paused a moment and an expression of pain passed over her face

Pale cadmium would be better she said quietly with a touch of
indifference in her tone and led the way out of the forest to the main
road




CHAPTER XV

MRS TAFTS FRONT PORCH


The autumn fires were being kindled on the mountainsfires of maple
oak and birch Along the leafstrewn roads the sumach blazed scarlet
and over the rude stone fences bloodred lines of fire followed the
trend of leaf and vine Golden pumpkins lay in the furrows of the corn
showers of apples carpeted the grass of the orchards the crows in
straight lines and the busy squirrels worked from dawn till dark

Over all settled the requiem haze of the dead summer blurring the
Notch and softening Moose Hillock to a film of gray against the pale
sky

It had been a summer of very great sweetness and charmthe happiest of
Olivers life He had found that he could do fairly well the things
that he liked to do best that the technical difficulties that had
confronted him when he began to paint were being surmounted as the
weeks went by and that the thing that had always been a pain to him
had now become a pleasurepain because try as he might the quality
of the result was always below his hopes a pleasure because some bit
of bark perhaps or glint of light on mosscovered rock or tender
vista had at last stood out on his canvas with every tone of color true

Only a painter can understand what all this meant to Oliver only an
outofdoor painter really The studioman who reproduces an old
study which years before has inspired him or who evolves a composition
from his inner consciousness has no such thrills over his work He
may perhaps have other sensations but they will lack the spontaneous
outburst of enthusiasm over the old sketch

And how glorious are the memories

The victorious painter has been weeks over these same trees that have
baffled him he has painted them on gray days and sunny days in the
morning at noon and in the gloaming He has loved their texture and
the thousand little lights and darks the sparkle of the black green
or gray moss and the delicate tones that played up and down their
stalwart trunks He has toiled in the heat of the day his nerves on
edge and sometimes great drops of sweat on his troubled forehead Now
and then he has sprung from his seat for a fartheraway look at his
sketch With a sigh and a heart bowed down oh how desolate are these
hours he has noted how wooden and commonplace and mean and despicable
his work waswhat an insult he has cast upon the beautiful yellow
birch this outdoor motionless old model that has stood so patiently
before him posing all day without moving its big arms above its head
its leaves and branches stockstill to make it all the easier for him

Suddenly in all this depression an inspiration has entered his dull
brainhe will use burnt umber in stead of Vandyke brown for the bark
or light chrome and indigo instead of yellow ochre and black for the
green

Presto Ah thats like it Another pat and another and still one
more

How quickly now the canvas loses its pasty mediocrity How soon the
paint and the brushmarks and the niggly little touches fade away and
the THING ITSELF comes out and says How do you do and that it is so
glad to see him and that it has been lurking behind these colors all
day trying to make his acquaintance and he would have none of it
What good friends he and the sketch have become now how proud he is of
it and of possessing it and of CREATING it Then little
quiveryquavers go creeping up and down his spine and away out to his
fingertips and he KNOWS that he has something really GOOD

He carries it home in his hand oh so carefully he strapped its
predecessor on his back yesterday without caring and a dozen times he
stops to look at its dear face propping it against a stump for a
better light just to see if he had not been mistaken after all He can
hardly wait until it is dark enough to see how it looks by gaslight
or candlelight or kerosene or whatever else he may have in his
quarters Years after the dear old thing is still hanging on his
studio wall He has never sold it nor given it away He could notit
was too valuable too constantly giving him good advice and showing him
what the thing WAS Not what he thought it was or hoped it was or
would like it to be but what it WAS

Yes there may be triumphs that come to men digging away on the dull
highway of lifetriumphs in business in politics in discovery in
law medicine and science To each and every profession and pursuit
there must come and does come a time when a rush of uncontrollable
feeling surges through the victors soul crowning long hours of work
but they are as dry ashes to a thirsty man compared to the boundless
ecstasy a painter feels when with a becaked palette some halfdried
tubes of color and a few wornout ragged brushes he compels a
sixbynine canvas to glow with life and truth

All this Oliver knew and felt The work of the summer attended at
first with a certain sense of disappointment had during the last few
weeks of sojourn as his touch grew surer not only become a positive
pleasure to him but had produced an exaltation that had kept our young
gentleman walking on clouds most of the time his head in the blue
ether

Margarets nice sense of color and correct eye had hastened this
result She could grasp at the first glance the masses of light and
shade giving each its proper value in the composition She and Oliver
really studied out their compositions together before either one set a
palette a most desirable practice by the way not only for tyros but
for Academicians

This relying upon Margarets judgment had become a habit with Oliver
He not only consulted her about his canvases but about everything else
that concerned him He had never formulated in his mind what this kind
of companionship meant to him we never do when we are in the midst of
it nor had he ever considered what would become of him when the
summer was over and the dream would end and they each would return to
the customary dulness of life a life where there would be no blue
ether nor clouds nor vanishing points nor values nor tones nor
anything else that had made their heaven of a summer so happy

They had both lived in this paradise for weeks without once bringing
themselves to believe it could ever end why do not such episodes last
forever when Oliver awoke one morning to the fact that the fatal day
of their separation would be upon him in a weeks time or less
Margaret with her more practical mind had seen farther ahead than
Oliver and her laugh in consequence had been less spontaneous of
late and her interest in her work and in Olivers less intense She
was overpowered by another sensation she had been thinking of the day
now so near when the old stage would drive up to Mrs Tafts
pasturegate and her small trunk and trap would be carried down on
Hanks back and tumbled in and she would go back alone to duty and the
prosaic life of a New England village

Neither of them supposed that it was anything else but the grief of
parting that afflicted them until there came a memorable autumn
nighta night that sometimes comes to the blessedwhen the moon swam
in the wide sky breasting the soft white clouds and when Oliver and
Margaret sat together on the porch of Mrs Tafts cottagehe on the
steps at her feet she leaning against the railing the moonlight full
upon her face

They had been there since sunset They had known all day what was in
each others mind but they had avoided discussing it Now they must
face it

You go tomorrow Madge Oliver asked He knew she did He spoke as
if announcing a fact

Yes

The shrill cry of a loon like the cry of a child in pain sifted down
the ravine from the lake above and died away among the pines soughing
in the nightwind Oliver paused for a moment to listen and went on

I dont want you to go I dont know what I am going to do without
you Madge he said with a long indrawn sigh

You are coming to us at Brookfield you know on your way back to New
York That is some thing She glanced at him with a slightly anxious
look in her eyes as if waiting for his answer to reassure her

He rose from his seat and began pacing the gravel Now and then he
would stop flick a pebble from its bed with his foot and walk on She
heard the sound of his steps but she did not look at him even when he
stopped abruptly in front of her

Yes I know butthat will only make it worse He was leaning over
her now one foot on the steps It tears me all to pieces when I think
this is our last night Weve had such a good time all summer You
dont want to go home do you

NoId rather stay The words came slowly as if it gave her pain to
utter them

Wellstay then he answered with some animation What difference
does a few days makes Let us have another week We havent been over
to Bog Eddy yet please stay Madge

No I must go Ollie

But well be so happy little girl

Life is not only being happy Ollie Its very real sometimes It is
to me and a faint sigh escaped her

Well but why make it real tomorrow Let us make it real next week
not now

It would be just as hard for you next week Why postpone it She was
looking at him now watching his face closely

Her answer seemed to hurt him With an impatient gesture he
straightened himself turned as if to resume his walk and then
pushing away the end of her skirt sat down beside her

I dont understand your theories Madge and Im not going to discuss
them I dont want to talk of any such things Im too unhappy
tonight When I look ahead and think that if the Academy should not
open you wouldnt come back at all and that I might not see you for
months Im all broken up What am I going to do without you Madge
His voice was quivering and a note of pain ran through it

Oh you will have your workyoull do just what you did before I came
up She was holding herself in by main strength why she could not
tellfighting an almost irresistible impulse to hide her face on his
breast and cry

What good will that do me when you are gone he burst out with a
quick toss of his head and a certain bitterness in his tone

Well but you were very happy before you saw me

Again the cry of the loon came down the ravine He turned and with one
of his quick impatient gestures that she knew so well put his hand on
her shoulder

Stop Madge stop Dont talk that way I cant stand it Look at me
The pain had become unbearable now Youve got to listen I cant keep
it back and I wont I never met anybody that I loved as I do you I
didnt think so at first I never thought I could think so but its
true You are not my sweetheart nor my friend nor my companion nor
anything else that ever came into my life You are my very breath my
soul my being I never want you to leave me I should never have
another happy day if I thought this was to end our life I laid awake
half the night trying to straighten it out and I cant and theres no
straightening it out and never will be unless you love me Oh Madge
Madge Dont turn away from me Let me be part of youpart of
everything you doand areand will be

He caught her hand in his warm palm and laid his cheek upon it Still
holding it fast he raised his head laid his other hand upon her hair
smoothing it softly and looked long and earnestly into her eyes as if
searching for something hidden in their depths Then in a voice of
infinite tenderness he said

Madge darling Tell me truecould you ever love me

She sat still her eyes fixed on his her hand nestling in his grasp
Then slowly and carefully one at a time she loosened with her other
hand the fingers that lay upon her hair held them for an instant in
her own bent her head and touched them with her lips




CHAPTER XVI

SOME DAYS AT BROOKFIELD FARM


Brookfield village lay in a great wide meadow through which strayed one
of Moose Hillocks lost brooksa brook tired out with leaping from
bowlder to bowlder and taking headers into deep pools and plunging
down between narrow walls of rock Here in the meadow it caught its
breath and rested idling along stopping to bathe a clump of willows
whispering to the shallows laughing gently with another brook that had
locked arms with it the two gossiping together under their breath as
they floated on through the tall grasses fringing the banks or circled
about the lilypads growing in the eddies In the middle of the meadow
just where two white ribbons of roads crossed was a clump of trees
pierced by a churchspire Outside of this bower of greena darker
green than the velvet meadowgrass about itglistened the roofs and
windows of the village houses

All this Oliver saw at a distance from the top of the stage

As he drew nearer and entered the main street the clump of trees
became giant elms their interlaced branches making shaded cloisters of
the village streets The buildings now became more distinct first a
tavern with a swinging sign and across the open common a quaint church
with a white tower

At the end of the avenue of trees under the biggest of the elms stood
an oldfashioned farmhouse its gardengate opening on the highway and
its broad acresone hundred or morereaching to the line of the
vagabond brook

This was Margarets home

The stage stopped the hairtrunk and sketchtrap were hauled out of
the dustbegrimed boot and deposited on the sidewalk at the foot of the
giant elm Oliver swung back the gate and walked up the path in the
direction of the lowroofed porch upon which lay a dog which raised
its head and at the first click of the latch came bounding toward him
barking with every leap

Neednt be afraid she wont hurt you shouted a grayhaired man in
his shirtsleeves who had risen from his seat on the porch and who was
now walking down the gardenpath Get out Juno I guess youre the
young man thats been painting with our Margaret up in the Gorge Shes
been expecting you all morning Little dusty warnt it

Olivers face brightened up This must be Margarets father

Mr Grant I suppose

Yes thats what they call meSilas Grant Let me take your bag My
son John will be here in a minute and will help you in with your
trunk Neednt worry its all right where it is Folks are middling
honest about here he added with a dry laugh and his hand closed on
his guestsa cold limp deadfish sort of a hand Oliver thought

Oliver said he was sure of it and that he hoped Miss Margaret was
well and the old man said she was Thank you and Oliver surrendered
the bagit was his sketchtrapand the two walked toward the house
During the mutual greetings the dog sniffed at Olivers knees and
looked up into his face

And I suppose this is Juno our hero said stopping to pat her head
Good dogyou dont remember me It seemed easier somehow to converse
with Juno than with her master The dog wagged her tail but gave no
indications of uncontrollable joy at meeting her rescuer again

Oh youve seen her Shes Margarets dog you know

Yes I know but shes forgotten me I saw her before I ever
knewyour daughter It was a narrow escape but he saved himself in
time Blessed old dog he said to himself and patted her again

By the time he had reached the porchsteps he had made unconsciously
to himself a mental inventory of his hosts special features tall
sparsely built with stooping shoulders and long arms the big hands
full of cold knuckles with rough fingertips Oliver found that out
when his own warm fingers closed over them thin face with high
cheekbones showing above his closelycropped beard and whiskers gray
eyessteady steelgray eyes hooded by white eyebrows stuck on like
two tufts of cottonwool nose big and strong square jaw hanging on a
hinge that opened and shut with each sentence the upper part of the
face remaining motionless as a mask Oliver remembered having once seen
a toy ogre with a jaw and face that worked in the same way He had
caught too the bend of his thin legs the hump of the high shoulders
and saw the brown skin of the neck showing through the closecut white
hair Suddenly a feeling of repugnance amounting almost to a shrinking
dislike of the man took possession of himit is just such trifles that
turn the scales of likes and dislikes for all of us Could this really
be Margarets father he said to himself Through whose veins then
had all her charm and loveliness come Certainly not from this cold man
without grace of speech or polish of manner

This feeling of repugnance had come with a flash and in a flash it was
gone On the top step of the low piazza stood a young girl in white a
rose in her hair her arm around a silverhaired old lady in gray silk
With a broad white handkerchief crossed over her bosom

Olivers hat was off in an instant

Margaret came down one step to greet him and held out both her hands
Oh we are so glad to welcome you Then turning to her companion she
said Mother this is Mr Horn who has been so good to me all summer

The old ladyshe was very deafcupped one hand behind her ear and
with a gracious smile extended the other to Oliver

I am so pleased you came sir and I want to thank you for being so
kind to our daughter Her brother John could not go with her and
husband and I are most too old to leave home now The voice was as
sweet and musical as a childs not the highkeyed strained tone of
most deaf people When they all stood on the porch level Margaret
touched Olivers arm

Speak slowly and distinctly Ollie she whispered then mother can
hear you

Oliver smiled in assent took the old ladys thin fingers and with a
cordiality the more pronounced because of a certain guilty sense he had
for his feeling of repugnance to her father said

Oh but think what a delight it was for me to be with her Every day
we painted together and you cant imagine how much she taught me you
know there is nobody in the Academy class who draws as well as your
daughter A light broke in Margarets eyes at this but she let him go
on She has told you of course of all the good times we have had
while we were at work Margaret had but not all of them It is I
who should thank YOU not only for letting Miss Margaret stay so long
but for wanting me to come to you here in your beautiful home It is my
first visit to thisbut you are standing I beg your pardon and he
looked about for a chair

There was only one chair on the porchit was under Silas Grant

No dont disturb yourself Mr Horn I prefer standing Mrs Grant
answered with a deprecatory gesture as if to detain Oliver No one in
Brookfield ever intruded on Silas Grants rights to his chair not even
his wife

Silas heard but he did not move he had performed his duty as host it
was the womenfolks turn now to be pleasant What he wanted was to be
let alone All this was in his face as he sat hunched up between the
arms of the splint rocker

Despite the old ladys protest Oliver made a step toward the seated
man His impulse was to suggest to his host that the lady whom he had
honored by making his wife was at the moment standing on her two little
feet while the lord of the manor was quietly reposing upon the only
chair on the piazza a fact doubtless forgotten by his Imperial
Highness

Mr Grant had read at a glance the workings of the young mans mind
and knew exactly what Oliver wanted but he did not move Something in
the bend of Olivers back as he bowed to his wife had irritated him He
had rarely met Southerners of Olivers classnever one so youngand
was unfamiliar with their ways This one he thought had evidently
copied the airs of a dancingmaster the wave of Olivers handit was
Richards in reality as were all the boys gesturesand the fine
speech he had just made to his wife proved it Instantly the
instinctive doubt of the Puritan questioning the sincerity of whatever
is gracious or spontaneous was roused in Silass mind From that
moment he became suspicious of the boys genuineness

The old lady however was still gazing into the boys face
unconscious of what either her husband or her guest was thinking

I am so glad you like our mountains Mr Horn she continued Mr
Lowell wrote his beautiful lines What is so Rare as a Day in June
in our village and Mr Longfellow never lets a summer pass without
spending a week with us And you had a comfortable ride down the
mountains and were the views enjoyable

Oh too beautiful for words It was Margaret this time not the
scenery he could not take his eyes from her as he caught the beauty
of her throat against the soft white of her dress and the exquisite
tint of the October rose in contrast with the autumnal browns of her
hair Never had he dreamed she could be so lovely He could not believe
for one moment that she was the Margaret he had known any one of the
Margarets in fact Certainly not that one of the Academy school in
blue gingham with her drawingboard in her lap alone selfpoised and
unapproachable among a group of artstudents or that other one in a
rough mountainskirt stoutshoes and a tamoshanter the gay and
fearless companion the comrade the coworker This Margaret was a
vision in white with arms bare to the elbowoh such beautiful arms
and the grace and poise of a duchessa Margaret to be reverenced as
well as loveda woman to bend low to

During this episode in which Silas sat studying the various
expressions that flitted across Olivers face Mr Grant shifted
uneasily in his chair At last his jaws closed with a snap while the
two tufts of cottonwool drawn together by a frown deeper than any
which had yet crossed his face made a straight line of white Olivers
enthusiastic outburst and the gesture which accompanied it had removed
Silas Grants last doubt His mind was now made up

The young fellow however rattled on oblivious now of everything
about him but the joy of Margarets presence

The view from the bend of the road was especially fine he burst
forth again his eyes still on hers You remember Miss Margaret your
telling me to look out for it he couldnt stand another minute of
this unless she joined in the talk In my own part of the State we
have no great mountains nor any lovely brooks full of trout And the
quantity of deer that are killed every winter about here quite
astonishes me Why Mr Pollards son Hank so he told me shot
fourteen last winter and there were over one hundred killed around
Moose Hillock You see our coast is flat and many of the farms in my
section run down to the water We have it is true a good deal of
game but nothing like what you have here and he shrugged his
shoulders and laughed lightly as if in apology for referring to such
things in view of all the wealth of the mountains about him

What kind of game have you got asked Mr Grant twisting his head
and looking at Oliver from under the straight line of cottonwool

Oliver turned his head toward the speaker Oh wild geese and
canvasback ducks and

And negroes There was a harsh note in Silass voice which sounded
like a saw when it clogs in a knot but Oliver did not notice it He
was too happy to notice anything but the girl beside him

Oh yes plenty of them and he threw back his head laughing this
time until every tooth flashed white

You hunt them too dont you With dogs most of the time I hear
There was no mistaking the bitterness in his voice now

The boys face sobered in an instant He felt as if someone had shot at
him from behind a tree

Not that I ever saw sir he answered quickly straightening
himself a peculiar light in his eyes We love ours

Love em Well you dont treat em as if you loved em

Margaret saw the cloud on Olivers face and made a step toward her
father

Mr Horn lives in the city father and never sees such things

Well if he does he knows all about it You own negroes dont you
The voice was louder the manner a trifle more insistent Oliver could
hardly keep his temper Only Margarets anxious face held him in check

No not now sirmy father freed all of his The tones were thin and
cold Margaret had never heard any such sound before from those
laughing lips

Silas Grant was leaning forward out of his chair The iron jaw was
doing the talking now

Where are these negroes he persisted

Two of them are living with us sir They are in my fathers house
now

Rather shiftless kind of help I guess Youve got to watch em all
the time I hear Steal everything they get their hands on dont
they This was said with a dry hard laugh that was meant to be
conciliatoryas if he expected Oliver to agree with him now that he
had had his say

Oliver turned quickly toward his hosts chair For a moment he was so
stunned and hurt that he could hardly trust himself to speak He looked
up and saw the expression of pain on Margarets face and instantly
remembered where he was and who was offending him

Our houseservants Mr Grant are part of our home he said in a
low determined voice without a trace of anger Old Malachi who was
my fathers bodyservant and who is now our butler is as much beloved
by everyone as if he were one of the family For myself I can never
remember the time when I did not love Malachi

Before her father could answer Margaret had her hand on Olivers
shoulder

Dont tell all your good stories to father now she said with a
grateful smile Wait until after dinner when we can all hear them
Come Mr Horn I know you want to get the dust out of your eyes Then
in an aside Dont mind him Ollie Its only fathers way and hes
the dearest father in the world when you understand him and she
pressed his arm meaningly as they walked to the door

Before they reached the threshold the gate swung to with a click and a
young man with a scythe slung over his shoulder strode up the path He
was in the garb of a farmhand trousers tucked into his boots shirt
open at the throat and head covered by a coarse straw hat This shaded
a goodnatured sunburnt face lighted by two bright blue eyes

Oh here comes my brother John Margaret cried Hurry up
Johnheres Mr Horn

The young man quickened his pace stopped long enough to hang the
scythe on the porchrail lifted his hat from his head and running up
the short flight of steps held out his hand cordially to Oliver who
advanced to meet him

Glad to see you Mr Horn Madge has told us all about you Excuse my
rigwe are short of men on the farm and I took hold Im glad of the
chance for I get precious little exercise since I left college You
came from East Branch by morning stage I suppose Oh is that your
trunk dumped out in the road What a duffer I was not to know Wait a
minuteIll bring it in and he sprang down the steps

No let me cried Oliver running after him He had not thought of
his trunk since he had helped stow it in the boot outside Ezra
Pollards gatebut then he had been on his way to Margarets

No you wont Stay where you aredont let him come Madge

The two young men raced down the path Juno scampering after them
John who could outrun any man at Dartmouth vaulted over the fence and
had hold of the brass handle before Oliver could open the gate

Fairplay cried Oliver and they each grasped a handleeither one
could have held it out at arms length with one handand brought it up
the gardenpath puffing away in pantomime as if it weighed a ton and
into the house There they deposited it in the bedroom that was to be
Olivers during the two days of his visit at Brookfield Farm Margaret
clapping her hands in high glee and her mother holding back the door
for them to pass in

Silas Grant watched the young fellows until they disappeared inside the
door lifted himself slowly from his seat by his long arms stretched
himself with a yawn to his full height and said aloud to himself as
he pushed his chair back against the wall

His fathers got a negro for bodyservant has he and a negro for
butlerjust like em They all want somebody to wait on em

At dinner Oliver sat on Mrs Grants righther best ear she
saidMargaret next and John opposite The father was at the foot in
charge of the carvingknife

During the pauses in the talk Olivers eyes wandered around the room
falling on the queer paper lining the wallshuntingscenes with
redcoated foxhunters leaping fivebarred gates on the sideboard
covered with silver but bare of a decanteronly a pitcher filled with
cider which Hopeful Prime the servant a woman of forty in spectacles
and who took part in the conversation brought from the cellar and
finally on a family portrait that hung above the fireplace A portrait
was always a loadstone to Oliver

Mrs Grant had been watching his glance

Thats Mr Grants greatuncleold Governor Shaw she said with a
pleased smile and the next one to it is Margarets greatgrandmother
This one and she turned partly in her chair and pointed to a face
Oliver thought he had seen before where he couldnt rememberis
John Quincy Adams He was my fathers most intimate friend and a
triumphant expression overspread her face

Oliver smiled too inwardly to himself The talk to his great
surprise reminded him of Kennedy Square Family portraits were an
inexhaustible topic of conversation in most of its homes He had never
thought before that people at the North had any ancestorsnone they
were very proud of

John looked up and winked Great scheme naming me after his Royal
Highness he said in an undertone Sure road to the White House
they thought Id make a good third

Mrs Grant went on not having heard a word of Johns aside This
table youre eating from once belonged to Mr Adams He gave it to my
father who often spent a week at a time with him in the White House

And I wish he was there now interrupted Silas from the foot of the
table Hed straighten out this snarl were drifting into Looks to me
as if there would be some powder burnt before this thing is over What
do your people say about it and he nodded at Oliver He had served
the turkey and was now sharpening the carver for the boiled ham
trying the edge with his thumb as Shylock did

I havent been at home for some time sir replied Oliver in a
courteous tonehe intended to be polite to the endand so I cannot
say My fathers letters seem to be very anxious but mother doesnt
think therell be any trouble at least she said so in her last letter

Silas looked up from under the tufts of cottonwool Were the mothers
running the politics of the South he wondered

And theres another thing you folks might as well remember Were not
going to let you break up the Union and were not going to pay you for
your slaves either and he plunged the fork into the ham that the
spectacled waitress had laid before him and rose in his chair the
knife poised in his hand to carve it the better

Mr Horn hasnt got any slaves to sell fatherdidnt you hear him
say so His father freed his laughed Margaret Her fathers
positiveness never really worried her She rather liked it at times It
was only because she had read in Olivers face the impression her
father was making upon him that she essayed to soften the force of his
remarks

I heard him Margaret I heard him Glad of itbut hes the only man
from his parts that I ever heard who did The others wont give em up
so easy They hung John Brown for trying to help the negroes free
themselves dont forget that Oliver looked up and knitted his brows
Silas saw it Im not meaning any offence to you young man he said
quickly waving the knife toward Oliver Im taking this question on
broad grounds If I had my way Id teach those slavedrivers and he
buried the knife in the yielding ham that

They did just right to hang him interrupted John Brown was a
fanatic and ought to have stayed at home No one is stronger than the
law Thats where old Ossawatomie Brown made a mistake Everybody was
entitled to express his or her opinion in this house except the dear
old mother Margarets fearless independence of manner and thought had
been nurtured in fertile soil

Mrs Grant had been vainly trying to get the drift of the conversation
her hand behind her ear

Parson Brown did you say John He married us sir and she turned
to Oliver He lived here over forty years The church that you passed
was where he preached

John laughed and so did Silas at the old ladys mistake but Oliver
only became the more attentive to his hostess He was profoundly
grateful to the reverend gentleman for coming out of his grave at this
opportune moment and diverting the talk into other channels Why did
they want to bother him with all this talk about slavery and the South
when he was so happy he could hardly stay in his skin It set his teeth
on edgehe wished that the dinner were over and everybody down at the
bottom of the sea but Margaret he had come to see his sweetheartnot
to talk slavery

Yes I saw the church and for the rest of the dinner Oliver was
entertained with the details in the life of the Rev Leonidas Brown
including his manner of preaching the crowds who would go to hear him
the number converted under the good mans ministrations to all of
which Oliver listened with a closeness of attention that would have
surprised those who knew him unless they had discovered that his elbow
had found Margarets during the recital and that the biography of
every member of Browns congregation might have been added to that of
the beloved pastor without wearying him in the slightest degree

When the nuts were servedSilas broke his with his fingershis host
made one more effort to draw Oliver into a discussion but Margaret
stopped it by exclaiming suddenly

Where shall Mr Horn smoke mother She wanted Oliver to herselfthe
family had had him long enough

Why does he want to SMOKE she answered with some consternation

Yes of course he does All painters smoke

Well I dont know let me see The old lady hesitated as if seeking
the choice between two evils I suppose in the sittingroom Nothe
library would be better

Oh I wont smoke at all if your mother does not like it Oliver
protested springing from his chair

Oh yes you will interrupted John I never smoke and father
dont but I know how good a pipe tastes Lets go into the library

Margaret gave Oliver the big chair and sat beside him It was a small
room the walls almost hidden with books the windows filled with
flowering plants There was a long table piled up with magazines and
pamphlets and an open fireplace the wall above the mantel covered
with framed pictures of weepingwillows worked out with hair of dead
relatives and the mantel itself with faded daguerreotypes propped
apart like halfopened clamshells

Mr Grant on leaving the diningroom walked slowly to the window
without looking to the right or left dropped into a chair and gazed
out through the leaves of a geranium The meal was over Now he wanted
rest and quiet When Mrs Grant entered the library and saw the wavy
lines of tobaccosmoke that were drifting lazily about the room she
stopped evidently annoyed and uneasy No such sacrilege of her library
had taken place for years not since her Uncle Reuben had come home
from China The waves of smoke must have caught the expression on her
face for she had hardly reached Olivers chair before they began
stealing along the ceiling in long slanting lines until they reached
the doorway when with a sudden swoop as if frightened and without
once looking back they escaped into the hall

The dear lady laid her hand on Olivers shoulder bent over him in a
tender motherly way and said

Do you think it does you any good

I dont know that it does

Why should you do it then

But I wont if youd rather Id not Oliver sprang to his feet took
his pipe from his mouth and was about to cross the room to knock the
ashes from it into the fireplace when Margaret laid her hand on his arm

No dont stop Mother is very foolish about some thingssmoking is
one of them

But I cant smoke darling he said in an undertone if your mother
objects The mother law was paramount to say nothing of the courtesy
required of him Then he added with a meaning look in his eyesCant
we get away some place where we can talk Deaf mothers are a blessing
sometimes

Margaret pressed his handher fingers were still closed over the one
holding the pipe

In a moment Ollie and she rose and went into the adjoining room

Mrs Grant went to her husbands side and in her gentle mission of
peace put her arm around his neck patting his shoulder and talking to
him in a low tone her two yellowwhite curls streaming down over the
collar of his coat Silas slipped his hand over his wifes and for an
instant caressed it tenderly with his cold bony fingers Then seeing
Olivers eyes turning his way he drew in his shoulders with a quick
movement and looked askance at his guest Any public show of affection
was against Silass creed and code If people wanted to hug each other
better do it upstairs he would say not where everybody was looking
on certainly not this young man who was enough of a mollycoddle
already

John now that Margaret had gone moved over from the lounge and took
her seat and the two young men launched out into a discussion of flies
and worms and fishbait and whether frogs legs were better than
minnows in fishing for pickerel and what was the bestsized shot for
woodcock and Jacksnipe Oliver told of the duckingblinds of the
Chesapeake and of how the men sat in wooden boxes sunk to the waters
edge with the decoy ducks about them and shot the flocks as they flew
over And John told of a hunting trip he had made with two East Branch
guides and how they went loaded for deer and came back with a bear and
two cubs And so congenial did they find each others society that
before Margaret returned to the roomshe had gone into her studio to
light the lamp under the teakettlethe two young fellows had
discovered that they were both very good fellows indeed especially
Oliver and especially John and Oliver had half promised to come up in
the winter and go into camp with John and John met him more than
halfway with a promise to accept Olivers invitation for a weeks
visit in Kennedy Square the next time he went home if that happy event
ever took place when they would both go down to Carrolls Island for a
crack at a canvasback

This had gone on for ten minutes or moreten minutes is an absurdly
long period of time under certain circumstanceswhen Margarets voice
was heard in the doorway

Come John you and Mr Horn have talked long enough I want to show
him my studio if youll spare him a moment

John knew when to spare and when not tooh a very intelligent brother
was John He did not follow and talk for another hour of what a good
time he would have duckshooting and of what togs he ought to
carryspoiling everything nor did he send his mother in to help
Margaret entertain their guest None of these stupid things did John
do He said he would go down to the postoffice if Oliver didnt mind
and would see him at supper and Margaret said that that was a very
clever idea as nobody had gone for the mail that day and there were
sure to be letters and not to forget to ask for hers Awfully sensible
brother was John Why arent there more like him

Entering Margarets studio was like going back to Moose Hillock There
were sketches of the interior of the schoolhouse and of the children
and of the teacher who had taught the year before There was Mrs Taft
sitting on that very porch peeling potatoes with a tin pan in her
lapwould they ever forget that porch and the moonlight and the song
of the treetoads and the cry of the loon There was Hank in
corduroys with an axe over his shoulder and Hank in a broad straw hat
and no shoes with a fishingpole in one hand and Hank chopping wood
the chips littering the ground There was Ezra Pollard sitting in his
buckboard with a buffalorobe tucked about him and Samanthy by his
side And best of all and in the most prominent place too there was
the original drawing of the Milothe one she was finishing when Oliver
upset Judson and which strange to say was the only Academy drawing
which Margaret had framedbesides scores and scores of sketches of
people and things and places that she had made in years gone by

The room itself was part of an old portico which had been walled up It
had a fireplace at one end holding a Franklin stove and a skylight
overhead the light softened by green shades Here she kept her own
books ranged on shelves over the mantel and in the niches and corners
and odd spaces a few rare prints and proofstwo Guido Renis and a
Leonardo both by Raphael Morghen Against the wall was an old
clothespress with brass handles its drawers filled with sketches as
well as a lounge covered with chintz and heaped up with cushions The
door between the studio and library had been taken off and was now
replaced by a heavy red curtain Margaret had held it aside for Oliver
to enter and it had dropped back by its own weight shutting them both
safely in

I dont know what happened when that heavy red curtain swung into
place and mother father sea sky sun moon stars and the planets
with all that in them is were shut out for a too brief moment

And if I did know I would not tell

We go through life and we have all sorts of sensations We hunger and
are fed We are thirsty and reach an oasis We are homeless and find
shelter We are ill and again walk the streets We dig and delve and
strain every nerve and tissue and the triumph comes at last and with
it often riches and honor All these things send shivers of delight
through us and for the moment we spread our wings and soar heavenward
But when we take in our arms the girl we love and hold close her
fresh sweet face with its trusting eyes and feel her warm breath on
our cheeks and the yielding figure next our heart knowing all the
time how mean and goodfornothing and how entirely unworthy of even
tying her shoestrings we are we experience a something compared with
which all our former flights heavenward are but the flutterings of bats
in a cave

And the blessed John did not come back until black dark nightnot
until it was so dark that you couldnt see your hand before you or the
girl beside you which is nearer the truth not until the stout woman
in spectacles with the conversational habit had brought in a lardoil
lamp with a big globe which she set down on Margarets table among her
books and papers And when John did come and poked his twiceblessed
head between the curtains it was not to sit down inside and talk until
suppertimes but to say that it was getting cold outside and that they
ought to have a fire if they intended to sit in the studio after
supper Oh what a trump of a brother And if they didnt mind hed
send Hopeful right away with some chips to start it All of which Miss
Hopeful Prime accomplished talking all the time to Margaret as she
piled up the logs and not forgetting a final word to Oliver as she
left the room to the effect that she guessed it must be kind o
comfortin to set by a firesuch luxuries of course to her
thinking being unknown in his tropical land where the blacks went
naked and the children lay about in the sun munching watermelons and
bananas

What an afternoon it had been They had talked of the woods and their
life under the trees of the sketches they made and how they could
improve them and would of the coming winter and the prospect of the
school being opened and what it meant to them if it did and how much
more if it did not and she be compelled to remain in Brookfield with
Oliver away all winter in New York and of a thousand and one other
things that lay nearest their hearts and with which neither you nor I
have anything to do

It was good Margaret thought to talk to him in this way and see the
quick response in his eyes and feel how true and helpful he was

She had dreaded his comingdreaded the contrasts which she knew his
presence among them would reveal She knew how punctiliously polite he
was and how brusque and positive was her father She realized too
how outspoken and bluff was John and how unaccustomed both he and her
dear deaf mother were to the ways of the outside world What would
Oliver think of them What effect would her home life have on their
future she kept saying to herself

Not that she was ashamed of her people certainly not of her father
who really occupied a higher position than any of his neighbors He was
not only a deacon in the church and chairman of the School Board but
he had been twice sent to the Legislature and at one time had been
widely discussed as a fitting candidate for Governor Nobody in
Brookfield thought the less of him because of his peculiaritiesmany
of his neighbors liked him the better for his brusqueness they
believed in a man who had the courage of his convictions and who spoke
out no matter whose toes he trod on

Nor could she be ashamed of her brother Johnso kind to everybody so
brave and generous and such a good brother Only she wished that he
had some of Olivers courtesy and that he would take off his hat when
a lady spoke to him in the road and keep it off till she bade him
replace it and observe a few of the other amenities but even with all
his defects of mannerall of which she had never before noticedhe
was still her own dear brother John and she loved him dearly

And as for her motherthat most gentle and gracious of womenthat one
person in the house who was considerate of everybodys feelings and
tolerant of everybodys impatience What could Oliver find in her
except what was adorable As she thought of her mother a triumphant
smile crossed her face Thats the one member of the Grant family
she said to herself whom my fine gentleman must admit is the equal of
any one of his toplofty kinsfolk in Kennedy Square or anywhere else
Which outburst the scribe must admit to himself was but another proof
of the fact that no such thing as true democracy exists the world over

None of these thoughts had ever crossed her mind up to the time she met
Oliver on the bridge that first sunny morning He had never discussed
the subject of any difference between their two families nor had he
ever criticised the personality of anyone she knew He had only BEEN
HIMSELF The change in her views had come gradually and unconsciously
to her as the happy weeks flew by Before she knew it she had realized
from his talk from his gestures even from the way he sat down or got
up or handled his knife and fork or left the room or entered it that
some of her early teachings had led her astray and that there might be
something else in life worth having outside of the four cardinal
virtueseconomy industry pluck and plainspeaking And if there
wereand she was quite certain of it nowwould Oliver find them at
Brookfield Farm This was really the basis of her disquietude the
kernel of the nut which she was trying to crack

If any of these shortcomings on the part of his entertainers had been
apparent to Oliver or if he had ever drawn any such deductions or
noted any such contrasts judged by the Kennedy Square code no word of
disappointment had passed his lips

Some things it is true during his visit at the farm had deeply
impressed him but they were not those that Margaret feared He had
thought of them that first night when going over the events of the day
as they passed in review before him One personality and one incident
had made so profound an impression upon him that he could not get to
sleep for an hour thinking about them It was the stalwart figure of
John Grant in his broadbrimmed straw hat and heavy boots striding up
the gardenpath with his scythe over his shoulder This apparition try
as he might would not down at his bidding

Think of that young fellow he kept repeating to himself The eldest
son and heir to the estate no doubt a collegebred man and a most
charming gentleman working like a common laborer in his fathers
field And proud of it tooand would do it again and talk about it
And yet I was so ashamed of working with my hands that I had to run
away from home for fear the boys would laugh at me

Margaret heard the whole story from Olivers lips the next morning with
many adornments and with any amount of good resolutions for the
future She listened quietly and held his hand the closer her eyes
dancing in triumph the color mounting to her cheeks but she made no
reply

Neither did she return the confidence and tell Oliver how she wished
her father could see some things in as clear a light and be more
gentle and less opinionated She was too proud for that

And so the days crowded thick with emotions sped on

The evening of their first one came and passed with its halfhours
when neither spoke a word and when both trembled all over for the very
joy of living and the morning of the second arrived bringing with it
a happiness she had never known before and then the morning of the
thirdand the last day

They had kept their secret even from John Oliver wanted to inform her
father at once of his attachment telling her it was not right for him
to accept the hospitality of her parents unless they understood the
whole situation but she begged him to wait and he had yielded to her
wishes

They had all discussed him at their pleasure

Nice chap that young Horn John had said to her the night before We
had three or four of em in my class one from Georgia and two from
Alabama Theyd fight in a minute but theyd make up just as quick
This ones the best of the lot He spoke as if they had all belonged
to another racedenizens of Borneo or Madagascar or the islands of the
Pacific

I have sent my love to his mother my dear Mrs Grant had confided
to her early that same morning I am sure he has a good mother He is
so kind and polite to me he never lets me remember that I am deaf when
I talk to him and she looked about her in her simple patient way

Yesperhaps so said Silas sitting hunched up in his chair Seems
sort of skippylike to me Something of a Dandy Jim I should say Good
enough to make men painters of I guess Artists in those days had few
friends North or South

None of these criticisms affected Margaret She didnt care what they
thought of him She knew his heart and so would they in time

When Oliver had said all his public goodbyes to the rest of the
familythe goodbyes with which we have nothing to do had been given
and taken in the studio with the curtains drawnhe joined Margaret at
the gate

They were standing in the road now under the giant elm waiting for
the stage She stood close beside him touching his arm with her own
mournfully counting the minutes before the stage would come her eyes
up the road All the light and loveliness of the summers all the joy
and gladness of life would go out of her heart when the door of the
lumbering vehicle closed on Oliver




CHAPTER XVII

LIVE COALS FROM MISS CLENDENNINGS WOODFIRE


His goodbyes said one absorbing thought now filled Olivers mindto
reach Kennedy Square on the wings of the wind and there to pour into
the ears of his mother and Miss Lavinia and of anyone else who would
listen the whys and wherefores of his love for Margaret with such
additional description of her personal charms qualities and talents
as would bring about in the shortest possible time the most amicable
of relations between Kennedy Square and Brookfield Farm He was
determined that his mother should know her at once He knew how strong
her prejudices were and what her traditions would cause her to think of
a woman who led the life that Margaret did but these things did not
deter him A new love now filled his heartanother and a different
kind of love from the one he bore his mother One that belonged to him
one that was his own and affected his life and soul and career He was
prepared to fight even harder for this desire of his soul than for his
art

There being no airships available for immediate charter nor big
balloons waiting for passengers with sandbags ready for instant
unloading nor any underground pneumatic tubes into which he could be
pumped and with a puff landed on his own doorstep in Kennedy Square
the impatient lover was obliged to content himself with the back seat
of the country stage and a night ride in the train down the valley

Then came a delay of a week in New York waiting for the return of Mr
Slade to the citywhom you must by all means see before coming home
so his mothers letter ran This delay was made bearable by Waller
Bowdoin and old Professor Cummings who went into spasms of delight
over the boys sketches Waller especially predicted a sure future for
him if he would have the grit to throw overboard every other thing he
was doing and stick it out and starve it out until he pulled through
and became famous

Mr Slade while welcoming him with both hands was not so cheering
The financial and political situations were no better he said They
had really become more alarming every day The repudiation of Northern
accounts by Southern merchants had ceasedat least some of Morton
Slade  Cos customers had redeemed their obligations and had
forwarded them their overdue remittances tiding them over for a
timebut no one could say what was in store for any firm whose
business lay largely in the Southern States He would however make
his word good Olivers situation was still open and he could again
occupy his desk as soon as he returned from Kennedy Square The length
of his service depended entirely on whether the country would go to war
or whether its difficulties could be satisfactorily settled in the next
Congress

But none of these thingsnone of the more depressing onesdulled for
an instant the purpose or chilled the enthusiasm of our young lover
Wars pestilence financial panics and even social tidalwaves might
overwhelm the land and yet not one drop of the topmost edge of the
flood could wet the tips of his highstepping toes Margaret was his
he trod an enchanted realm

An enthusiasm of equal intensity but of quite a different kind had
taken possession of the Horn mansion as the hour of Olivers arrival
approached as anyone would have noticed who happened to be inside its
hospitable walls Something out of the common was about to happen
There was an unusual restlessness in Malachi totally at variance with
his grave and dignified demeanor His perturbation was so great that he
even forgot the timehonored custom of wheeling his masters chair into
position and the equally timehonored salutation of yo chairs all
ready Marse Richard It was noticed too that he could not keep out
of the hall Richard had to speak to him twice and Mrs Horn had lifted
her head in astonishment when that hitherto attentive darky handed her
Richards spectacles instead of her own Or he would start to enter the
diningroom his hands laden with plates or the library his arms
filled with logs to replenish the fire and then stop suddenly and
listen with one foot raised standing like an old dog locating a
partridge So nervous did he become as the twilight deepened and he
began to set the table for supper that he dropped a cup smashing it
into atoms a thing that had not happened to him before in twenty
yearsone of the blue and giltpriceless heirlooms in the family and
only used when a distinguished guest was expected At another time he
would have dropped the whole tray with everything upon it had not Aunt
Hannah saved it in time How she came to be in the pantry with her two
eyes on the front door when her place was in the kitchen with both of
them on the pots and kettles no one could tell Everything seemed to
be at sixes and sevens in the old house that night

And the other members of the household inside the drawingroom seemed
just as restless Richard who had raked the coals of his forge closed
the green door of his workshop and had dressed himself an hour earlier
than usual much to Malachis delight became so restless that he got
up from his easychair half a dozen times and roamed aimlessly about
the room stopping to pick up a book reading a line and laying it down
again Mrs horn dropped so many stitches that she gave up in despair
and said she believed she would not knit

Malachi heard him first

Dats himdats Marse Ollie he cried I know dat knock Here he
is Mistis Here he is He sprang forward threw wide the door and had
him by the hand before the others could reach him

Fo Gawd Marse Ollie aint ol Malachi glad ter git his hans on yer
once mo

It was unseemly and absurd how the old man behaved

And the others were not far behind

My boy exclaimed Mrs Horn as she held him close to her breast
There are few words spoken in times like this

Richard waited behind her until that imperceptible moment of silence
had passedthe moment a mother gets her arms around the son she loves
Then when the sigh of restful relief that always follows had spent
itself and she had kissed him with his cheek held fast to hers Oliver
loosened his hold and threw his arms about his fathers neck patting
him between his shoulderblades as he kissed him

Dear old dad Oh but its good to get home And Aunt Hannah you
there and he extended his hand while his other arm was still around
his fathers neck

Yas Marse Oilie dats me dats ol Hannah and she stepped closer
and grasped his outstretched hand smoothing it as she spoke Lord
Marse Ollie but aint you filled out You is de probable son sho
honey come home to yo people

But Oliver was not through with Malachi He must take both of his hands
this time and look into his eyes It was all he could do to keep from
hugging him It would not have been the first time

Been well Mallie

Of course he had been he saw it in his face It was only to say
something to which the old darky could reply toto keep in touch with
himto know that he was speaking to this same old Malachi whom he had
so dearly loved

Middlin poly yasmiddlin poly suh

Malachi had not the slightest idea what he was talking about He had
not been sick a minute since Oliver left His heart was too near
bursting with pride at his appearance and joy over his return for his
mind to work intelligently

Dem Yankees aint spiled ye no dey aint Goramighty aint
Malachi glad Tears were standing in his eyes now There was no one
but Richard he loved better than Oliver

No fatted calf was spitted and roasted this night on Aunt Hannahs
swinging crane for this probable son but there was cornpone in
plenty and a chafing dish of terrapinMalachi would not let Aunt
Hannah touch it he knew just how much Madeira to put in Hannah always
drowned it he would say And there was sallylunn and Maryland
biscuit here at last Aunt Hannah was supremeher elbows told the
story And last of all there was a great dish of escalloped oysters
cooked in fossil scallop shells thousands of years old that Malachi
had himself dug out of the marlbanks at Yorktown when he was a boy
and which had been used in the Horn family almost as many times as they
were years old Oh for a revival of this extinct conchological
comfort But no It is just as well not to recall even the memories of
this toothsome dish There are no more fossils neither at Yorktown nor
anywhere else and no substitute in china tin or copper will be of
the slightest use in giving their flavor

Supper served and over with Oliver jumping up half a dozen times to
kiss his mother and plumping himself down again to begin on another
relay of pone or terrapin or oysters much to Malachis delight He do
eat he reported to Aunt Hannah I tell ye Hes bearin very heavy
on dem scallops Dats de third shellthe doors were opened with a
flourish and the three preceded by Malachi entered the drawingroom
in time to welcome the neighbors

Nathan who was already inside sitting by the fire his long thin legs
stretched out his bunchy white hair parted in the middle falling to
his collars edge sprang up and shook Olivers hand heartily He had
charged Malachi when he admitted him to keep his presence secret He
wanted them to have Oliver all to themselves

Miss Clendenning entered a moment later with both hands held out She
would not stop in the hall to unwind her nubia or take off her little
fur boots but motioned Oliver to her knees after she had kissed him
joyously on both cheeks and held out those two absurd little feet for
his ministrations while Mrs Horn removed her nubia and cloak

The ratatat at the door was now constant Judge Bowman and old Dr
Wallace and four or five of the young men with the young girls
entered all with expressions of delight at Olivers return home and
later with the air of a Lord High Mayor Colonel John Clayton of
Pongateague with Sue on his arm Clayton was always a picture when he
entered a room He stood six feet and an inch his gray hair brushed
straight back his goatee curling like a fishhook at its end
Handsome Jack Clayton was still handsome at sixty

After the Colonel had grasped Olivers hand in his warmest manner Sue
laid all of her ten fingers in his It was as good as a play to watch
the little witchs face as she stood for a moment and looked Oliver
over She had not written to him for months She had had half a dozen
beaus since his departure but she claimed him all the same as part of
her spoils His slight mustache seemed to amuse her immensely

Are you glad to see me Ollie she asked looking archly at him from
under her lashes

Why Sue

Of course he was gladfor a minutenot much longer How young she is
he thought how provincial As she rattled on he noticed the mass of
ringlets about her face and the way her head was set on her shoulders
Her neck he saw was much shorter than Margarets and a little out of
drawing Nor was there anything of that fearless look or toss of the
head like a surprised deer which made Margaret so distinguished
Oliver had arrived at that stage in his affection when he compared all
women to one

All this time Sue was reading his mind Trust a young girl for that
when she is searching a former lovers eyes for what lies behind them
She was evidently nettled at what she found and had begun by saying
she supposed the Yankee girls had quite captured his heart when the
Colonel interrupted her by asking Oliver whether the Northern men
really thought they could coerce the South into giving up their most
treasured possessions

He had been nursing his wrath all day over a fresh attack made on the
South by some Northern paper and Oliver was just the person to vent it
uponnot that he did not love the lad but because he was fresh from
the despised district

I dont think they want to sir They are opposed to slavery and so
are a good many of us You have a wrong idea of the life at the North
Colonel You have never been North I believe

No my dear Oliver and I never intend to If ever I go it will be
with a musket They have had it all their own way lately with their
Harriet Stowes William Lloyd Garrisons and John Browns it is our
turn now

Who do you want to run through the body Clayton asked Richard
joining the group and laying his hands affectionately on the Colonels
shoulders

Anybody and everybody Richard who says we are not free people to do
as we please

And is anybody really saying so

Yes you see it every day in every Northern editorialanother
todaya most villainous attack which you must read These Puritans
have been at it for years This psalmsinging crew have always hated
us Now while they are preaching meekness and lowliness and the rights
of our fellowmenblack ones they meanthey are getting ready to wad
their guns with their hymnbooks Its all a piece of their infernal
hypocrisy

But why should they hate us Clayton asked Richard in a
halfhumorous tone He had no spirit of contention in him tonight not
with Oliver beside him

Because we Cavaliers are made of different stuff thats why All this
talk about slavery is nonsense These Nutmeg fellows approved of
slavery as long as they could make a dollar out of the traffic and
then as soon as they found out that they had given us a commercial
club with which to beat out their brains and that we were really
dominating the nation they raised this hue and cry about the
downtrodden negro and American freedom and the Stars and Stripes and a
lot of such tomfoolery Do you know any gentleman who beats his
negroes Do you beat Malachi Do I beat my Sam whom I have brought up
from a boy and who would lay down his life any day for me I tell you
Richard it is nothing but a fight for financial and political mastery
Theyre afraid of us theyve been so for years They cried Wolf when
the fugitive slave law was passed and theyve kept it up ever since

No I dont believe it exclaimed Richard with a positive tone in
his voice and neither do you Clayton Its largely a question of
sentiment They dont believe one man should hold another in bondage

Thats where you are wrong They dont care a fippenny bit about the
negro If they ever succeed in their infernal purpose and abolish
slavery and set the negro adrift mark my words they wont live with
him and they wont let him come North and work alongside of their own
people Theyll throw him back on us after they have made a beggar and
a criminal of him Only a Southerner understands the negro and only a
Southerner can care for him See what we have done for them Every
slave that landed on our shores we have changed from a savage into a
man They forget this

Judge Bowman joined in the discussionso did Dr Wallace The Judge
in his usual ponderous way laid down the law both State and
Nationalthe Doctor who always took the opposite side in any
argument asking him rather pointed questions as to the rights of the
Government to control the several States as a unit

Richard held his peace He felt that this was not the night of all
others to discuss politics and he was at a loss to understand the
Colonels want of selfrestraint He could not agree with men like
Clayton He felt that the utterance of such inflammatory speeches only
added fuel to the smouldering flame If the ugly jets of threatening
smoke that were creeping out everywhere because of the friction between
the two sections were in danger of bursting into flame the first duty
of a patriot according to his creed was to stand by with pails of
water not with kegs of gunpowder So while Claytons outspoken tirade
still filled the room he with his usual tact did all he could to
soften the effect of his words Then again he did not want Olivers
feelings hurt

Malachis entrance with his tray just as the subject was getting
beyond control put a stop to the discussion The learned group of
disputants with the other guests quickly separated into little
coteries the older men taking their seats about an opened cardtable
on which Malachi had previously deposited several thin glasses and a
pair of decanters the ladies sitting together and the younger people
laughing away in a corner where Oliver joined them

Richard and Nathan now that the danger was averted they were both
natural born peacemakers stepped across the room to assist in
entertaining Miss Clendenning The little lady had not moved from the
chair in which she sat when Oliver relieved her of her fur boots She
rarely did move when once she had chosen a place for herself in a
drawingroom She was the kind of woman who could sit in one place and
still be surroundedby halfmoons of adorers if she sat against the
wall by full moons if she sat in the open She had learned the art
when a girl

If Clayton would go among these people my dear Lavinia said
Richard in a deprecating tone drawing up a chair and seating himself
beside her he would find them very different from what he thinks
Some of the most delightful men I have ever met have come from the
States north of us You know that to be so

That depends Richard on how far North you go Miss Clendenning
answered spreading her fan as she spoke looking in between the sticks
as if searching for specimens In Philadelphia I find some very
delightful houses quite like our own In New Yorkwell I rarely go
to New York The journey is a tiresome one and the hotels abominable
They are too busy there to be comfortable and I do not like noisy
restless people They give me a headache

Oliver has met some charming people he tells me said Richard Mr
Slade took him into his own home and treated him quite like a son

Of course he did why not Miss Clendenning was erect now her eyes
snapping with roguish indignation Anybody would be glad to take
Oliver into their home especially when they have two marriageable
daughters Olivers bow as he enters a room is a passport to any
society in the world my dear Richard My Lord Chesterfield Clayton has
no better manners nor any sweeter smile than our own Lorenzo Watch
Oliver now as he talks to those girls

Richard had been watching him he had hardly taken his eyes from him
Every time he looked at him his heart swelled the more with pride

And you think Lavinia Mr Slade invited him because of his manners
He was sure of it He only wanted her to confirm it

Of course What else and she cut her eye at him knowingly How many
of the other clerks did he invite Not one I wanted to find out and I
made Ollie write me They are queer people these Northerners They
affect to despise good blood and good breeding and good manners Thats
all folderolthey love it They are eternally talking of
equalityequality one man as GOOD as another When they say that one
man is as GOOD as another Richard they mean that THEY are as good
never the other poor fellow

Now my dear Lavinia stop a moment laughed the inventor in protest
You do not mean to say there are really no gentlemen north of us

Plenty of gentlemen Richard but few thoroughbreds There is a
distinction you know

Which do you value most

Oh the thoroughbred A gentleman might some time offend you by
telling you the truth about yourself or your friends The thoroughbred
never and she lifted her hands in mock horror

And he could be a rogue and yet his manners would save him

Quite true dear Richard quite true The most charming man I ever met
except your dear selfand she smiled graciously and lowered her voice
as if what she was about to tell was in the strictest confidencewas
a shrivelledup old prince who once called on my father and myself in
Vienna He was as ugly as a crab and walked with a limp There had
been some words over a cardtable he told me and the other man fired
first I was a young girl then but I have never forgotten him to this
day Indeed my dear Nathan and she turned to the old musician and
laid her wee hand confidingly on his knee but for the fact that the
princess was a most estimable woman and still alive I might have
beenwell I really forget what I might have been for I do not
remember his name but it was something most fascinating in five or six
syllables Now all that man ever did to make that unaccountable
impression upon me was just to pick up my handkerchief Oh Nathan it
really gives me a little quiver to this day I never watch Oliver bow
but I think of my prince Now I have never found that kind of quality
grace bearing presencewhatever you may choose to call itin the
Puritan He has not time to learn it He despises such subtle
courtesies They smack of the cavalier and the court to him He is
content with a nod of the head and a hurried handshake So are his
neighbors They would grow suspicious of each others honesty if they
did more Tut tut my dear Richard My princes grooms greeted each
other in that way

Richard and Nathan laughed heartily And you only find the manners of
the antechamber and the throneroom South asked the inventor

Umnot always It used to be so in my day and yours but we are
retrograding It is unpardonable in our case because we have known
better But up there and she pointed in the direction of the North
Star they never did know better thats some excuse for them

Ah you incorrigible woman you must not talk so You have not seen
them all Many of the men who do me the honor to come to my workroom
are most delightful persons Only last week there came one of the most
interesting scientists that I have met for

Of course of course I have not a doubt of it my dear Richard but I
am talking of men my friend not dried mummies

Again Richard laughed One of his greatest pleasures was to draw Miss
Clendenning out on topics of this class He knew she did not believe
onehalf that she said It was the way she parried his thrusts that
delighted him

Well then take Mr Winthrop Pierce Lawrence No more charming
gentleman ever entered my house You were in London at the time or you
would certainly have dined with him here Mr Lawrence is not only
distinguished as a statesman and a brilliant scholar but his manners
are perfect

Miss Clendenning turned her head and looked at Richard under her
eyelashes Where did you say he was from

Boston

Boston A rippling gurgling laugh floated through the room

Yes Boston Why do you laugh

Bostonians my dear Richard have habits and customs never manners
It is impossible that they should They are seldom underbred mind you
they are always overbred and strange to say without the slightest
sense of humor for they are all brought up on serious isms and solemn
fads The excitement we have gone through over this outrageous book of
this Mrs Stowes and all this woman movement is but a part of their
training How is it possible for people who believe in such dreadful
persons as this Miss Susan Anthony and that MisssomethingorotherI
forget her nameto know what the word home really means and what
graces should adorn it They could never understand my ugly prince and
hewell he would be too polite to tell them what he thought of them
No my dear Richard they dont know they never will know and they
never will be any better

Oliver had crossed the room and had reached her chair

Who will never be any better you dear Midget he cried

You you dear boy because you could not Come and sit by me where I
can get my hand on you If I had my way you would never be out of reach
of my five fingers

Oliver brought up a stool and sat at her feet

Your Aunt Lavinia Ollie said Richard rising to his feet this
relationship was of the same character as that of Uncle Nathan Gill
seems to think our manners are retrograding

Not yours protested Oliver with a laugh as he turned quickly
toward Miss Clendenning

No you sweetheart nor yours answered Miss Clendenning with a
sudden burst of affection Come now you have lived nearly two years
among these dreadful Yankeeswhat do you think of them

What could I think of people who have been so kind to me Fred Stone
has been like a brother and so has everybody else

Mrs Horn had joined the group and sat listening

But their manners my son she asked Do you see no difference
between them andandand your fathers for instance and she
motioned toward Richard who was now moving across the room to speak to
other guests

Dad is himself and you are yourself and I am myself replied Oliver
with some positiveness When people are kind I never stop to think how
they do it

Lovely Miss Clendenning whispered to Nathan Spoken like a
thoroughbred Yes he is BETTER than my ugly prince He would always
have remembered how they did it

And you see no difference either in the ladies continued Mrs Horn
with increasing interest in her tones Are the young girls as sweet
and engaging She had seen Margarets name rather often in his letters
and wondered what impression she had made upon him Olivers eyes
flashed and the color mounted to his cheeks Miss Clendenning saw it
and bent forward a little closer to get his answer

Well you see mother I do not know a great many I am so shut up
Miss Grant whom I wrote you about iswell you must see her She is
not the kind of girl that you can describe very wellshe really is not
the kind of girl that you can describe at all We have been together
all summer and I stopped at her fathers house for a few days when I
came down from the mountains They live in the most beautiful valley
you ever saw

Miss Clendenning was watching him closely She caught a look that his
mother had missed

Is she pretty Ollie asked Miss Lavinia

She is better than pretty You would not say the Milo was pretty
would you There is too much in her for prettiness

And are the others like her The little lady was only feeling about
trying to put her finger on the pulse of his heart

No there is nobody like her Nobody I have ever met

Miss Clendenning was sure now

Malachis second entrancethis time with the great china bowl held
above his headagain interrupted the general talk

Since the memory of man no such appletoddy had ever been brewed

Even Colonel Clayton when he tasted it looked over his glass and
nodded approvingly at its creatora recognition of genius which that
happy darky acknowledged by a slight bend of his back anything else
being out of the question by reason of the size of the bowl he was
carrying and the presence of his master and of his masters guests

This deposited on a side table another bowl filled with Olioa most
surprising and nevertobeforgotten salad of chicken and celery and
any number of other toothsome thingswas placed beside it together
with a plate of moonshines and one of Maryland biscuits

Then came some music in which Oliver sang and Miss Clendenning played
his accompanimentsthe old plantation melodies not the new songsand
next the wrappings up in the hall the host and hostess and the whole
party moving out of the drawingroom in a body Here Nathan with great
gallantry insisted on getting down on his stiff marrowbones to put on
Miss Clendennings boots while the young men and Oliver tied on the
girls hoods amid goodbyes and so glads that he could come home
if only for a day and that he had not forgotten them Olivers last
words being whispered in Miss Clendennings ear informing her that he
would come over in the morning and see her about a matter of the
greatest importance And so the door was shut on the last guest

When the hall was empty Oliver kissed his father goodnight and
slipping his arm around his mothers waist as he had always done when
a boy the two went slowly upstairs to his little room He could not
wait a minute longer He must unburden his heart about Margaret This
was what he had come for If his mother had only seen her it would be
so much easier he said to himself as he pushed open his bedroom door

You are greatly improved my son she said with a tone of pride in
her voice I see the change already She had lighted the candle and
the two were seated on the bed his arm still around her

How mother

Oh in everything The boy is gone out of you You are more reposeful
more selfreliant I like your modesty too She could tell him of his
faults she could also tell him of his virtues

And the summer has done you good she continued I felt sure it
would Mr Slade has been a steadfast friend of yours from the
beginning Tell me now about your new friends This Miss Grantis she
not the same girl you wrote me about some mouths agothe one who drew
with you at the art school Do you like her people This thought was
uppermost in her mindhad been in fact ever since she first saw
Margarets name in his letters

Her mother is lovely and she has got a brothera Dartmouth manwho
is a fine fellow I liked him from the first moment I saw him Oliver
answered simply wondering how he would begin

Is her father living

Yes

What kind of a man is he

Wellof course he is not like our people He is awellhe always
says just what he thinks you know But he is a man of character and
position He was speaking for Margaret now They have more family
portraits than we have This was said in a tone that was meant to
carry weight

And people of education

Oh I should certainly say so It is nothing but books all over the
house Really he has more books than Dad This statement was to
strengthen the one regarding the family ancestorsboth telling
arguments about Kennedy Square

And this girlis she a lady

The question somehow put to flight all his mental manoeuvres She is
more than a lady mother She is the dearest He stopped hesitated
for an instant and slipping his arm around his mothers neck drew her
close to him Then in a torrent of wordshis cheeks against hersthe
whole story came out He was a boy again now that quality in him that
would last all his life She listened with her eyes on the floor her
heart torn with varying emotions She was disturbed but not alarmed
One phase of the situation stood out clearly in her practical mindhis
poverty and the impossibility of any immediate marriage Before that
obstacle could be removed she felt sure his natural vacillation
regarding women would save him He would forget her as he had Sue

And you say her brother works in the fields and that her father and
mother permitted this girl to leave home and sit night after night with
you young men with no other protection than that of a common
Irishwoman There was a tone of censure now in her voice that roused a
slight antagonism in Oliver

Why not What could harm her There was no other place for her to go
where she could learn anything

Mrs Horn kept still for a moment looking on the floor Oliver sat
watching her face

And your family my son she protested with a certain patient
disapproval in her tones Do they count for nothing I of course
would love anybody you would make your wife but you have others about
you No man has a right to marry beneath him Do not be in a hurry over
this matter Come home for your wife when you are ready to marry Give
yourself time to compare this girl who seems to have fascinated you
withSue for instance or any of the others you have been brought up
with

Oliver shrugged his shoulders at the mention of Sues name He had
compared her

You would not talk this way dearie if you could see her he replied
in a hopeless way as if the futility of making his mother understand
was now becoming apparent to him She is different from anyone you
ever metshe is so strong so finesuch a woman in all that the word
means Not something you fondle and make love to remember but a woman
more like a Madonna that you worship or a Greek goddess that you might
fear As to the family part of it I am getting tired of it all
mother What good is Grandfather Horn or anybody else to me I have got
to dig my way out just as they did Just as dear old Dad is doing If
he succeeds in his work who will help him but himself There have been
times when I used to love to remember him sitting by his readinglamp
or with his violin tucked under his chin and I was proud to think he
was my father Do you know what sets my blood on fire now It is when I
think of him standing over his forge and blowing his bellows his hands
black with coal I understand many things dearie that I knew nothing
about when I left home You used to tell me yourself that everybody had
to work and you sent me away to do it I looked upon it then as a
degradation I see it differently now I have worked with all my might
all summer and I have brought back a whole lot of sketches that the
boys like Now I am going to work again with Mr Slade I do not like
his work and I do love mine but I am going to stick to his all the
same I have got something to work for now and his face brightened
I am going to win

She did not interrupt him It was better he should unburden his heart
She was satisfied with his record if he went wrong she only was to
blame But he was not going wrong nor was there anything to worry
aboutnot even his artnot so long as he kept his place with Mr
Slade and only took it up as a relaxation from more weighty cares It
was only the girl that caused her a moments thought

She saw too through all his outburst a certain independence and a
fearlessness and a certain fixedness of purpose that sent an exultant
thrill through her even when her heart was burdened with the thought of
this new danger that threatened him She had sent him away for the
fault of instability and he had overcome it Should she not now hold
fast as she had before and save him the second time from this girl
who was beneath him in station and who would drag him down to her
level and so perhaps ruin him

We will not talk any more about it tonight my son she said in
tender tones leaning forward and kissing him on the cheekit was
through his affections that she controlled him You should be tired
out with your days journey and ought to rest Take my advicedo not
ask her to be your wife yet Think about it a little and see some other
women before you make up your mind

A delicious tremor passed through Oliver He HAD asked her and she HAD
promised He remembered just the very day the hour the minute That
was the bliss of it all But this he did not tell his mother He would
not hurt her any further now Some other day he would tell her when
she could see Madge and judge for herself No not tonight and so
with the secret untold he kissed her and led her to her room

And yet strange to say it was the one only thing in all his life that
he had kept from her

Ah these mothers who make lovers of their only sons dominating their
lives How bitter must be the hours when they realize that anothers
arms are opening for them

And these boyswhat misgivings come what doubts How the old walls
impregnable from childhood begin to crumble How little now the dear
mother knowsshe so wise but a few moons since How this new love
steps in front of the old love and claims every part of the boy as its
very own


Faithful to her promise Miss Clendenning waited the next morning for
Oliver in her little boudoir that opened out of the library A bright
fire blazed and crackled sending its beams dancing over the room and
lighting up the red curtains that hung behind her writingdesk its top
covered with opened lettersher mornings mail many bore foreign
postmarks and not a few were emblazoned with rampant crests sunk in
little dabs of colored wax She wore a morning gown of soft white
flannel belted in at the waist Covering her head and wound loosely
about her throat was a fluff of transparent silk halfconcealing the
two nests of little gray and brown knots impaled on hairpins These
were the chrysalides of those gay butterfly sidecurls which framed her
sweet face at night and to which she never gave wing until after
luncheon no matter who called The silk scarf that covered them this
morning was in recognition of Olivers sex

She had finished her breakfast and was leaning forward in her
rockingchair her elbows on her knees her tiny feet resting on the
fender She was watching the firefairies at work building up their
wonderful palaces of molten gold studded with opals and rubies The
little lady must have been in deep thought for she did not know Oliver
had entered until she felt his arm on her shoulder

Ah you dear fellow No not there sit right here on this cricket by
my side Stop do not say a word I have been studying it all out in
these coals I know all about itit is about the mountain girl
thiswhat do you call her

Miss Grant

Nonsense What do YOU call her

Madge

Ah thats something like it And you love her

Yes Pianissimo

And she loves you

YES Forte

And you have told her so

YES Fortissimo

Whew Miss Clendenning caught her breath and gave a little gasp
Well upon my word You dont seem to have lost any time my young
Romeo What does her father say

He doesnt know anything about it

Does anybody except you two babes in the wood

Yes her mother

And yours You told her last night I knew you would

Not everything but she is all upset

Of course she is So am I Now tell meis she a LADY

She is the dearest sweetest girl you

Come now come now answer me They are all the dearest and sweetest
things in the world What I want to know is is she a lady

Yes

True now Olliehonest

Yes in every sense of the word A woman you would love and be proud
of the moment you saw her

Miss Clendenning took his face in her hands and looked down into his
eyes I believe you Now what do you want me to do

I want her to come down here so everybody can see her If I had a
sister she could invite her and it would be all right and maybe then
her mother would let her come

And you want me to play the sister and have her come here

Olivers fingers closed tight over Miss Clendennings hand Oh
Midget if you only would that would fix everything Mother would
understand then why I love her and Madge could go back and tell her
people about us Her father is very bitter against everybody at the
South They would feel differently if Madge could stay a week with us

Why wont her father bring her

He never leaves home He would not even take her to the mountains
fifteen miles away She could never paint as she does if she had relied
upon him Mother and Mr Grant are both alike in their hatred of art as
a fitting profession for anybody and I tell you that they are both
wrong

Miss Clendenning looked up in surprise She had never seen the boy take
a stand of this kind against one of his mothers opinions Oliver saw
the expression on the little ladys face and kept on his cheeks
flushed and a set look about his eyes

Yes wrong I have never believed mother could be wrong in anything
before and when she wanted me to give up painting I did so because I
thought she knew best But I know shes not right about Madge and if
she is wrong about her how do I know she was not wrong about my
working with Mr Crocker

Margarets words that day in the bark slant were now ringing in his
ears He had never forgotten themYour mother cannot coddle you up
forever

Miss Clendenning held her peace She was not astonished at the revolt
in the boys mind She had seen for months past in his letters that
Olivers individuality was asserting itself It was the new girl whom
he was defendingthe woman he loved This had given him strength She
knew something of what he felt and she knew what blind obedience had
done for her With a halfsmothered sigh she reached over Olivers
head dipped a quill pen in her inkstand and at Olivers dictation
wrote Margarets address

I will invite her at once she said

Long after Oliver had gone Miss Clendenning sat looking into the fire
The palaces of rose and amber that the busy fingers of the fire fairies
had built up in the white heat of their enthusiasm were in ruins The
light had gone out Only gray ashes remained with here and there a
dead cinder

Miss Clendenning rose from her chair stood a moment in deep thought
and said aloud

If she loves him she shall have him There shall be no more desolate
firesides if I can help it


Early the next morning she mailed by the first post a letter so dainty
in form and so delicate in color that only a turtledove should have
carried it to Brookfleld Farm and have dropped it into Margarets
hand This billetdoux began by inviting Miss Margaret Grant of
Brookfield Farm to pass a week with Miss Lavinia Clendenning of
Kennedy Square she Miss Lavinia desiring to know the better one who
had so charmed and delighted our dear Oliver and ended with Please
say to your good mother that I am twice your age and will take as
much care of you as if you were my own daughter I feel assured she
will waive all ceremony when she thinks of how warm a greeting awaits
you

Margaret looked at the postmark and then at the little oval of violet
wax bearing the crest of the Clendenningsgranted in the time of Queen
Elizabeth for distinguished services to the Throneand after she had
read it to her mother and had shown the seal to her father who had
put on his glasses scanned it closely and tossed it back to her with
a dry laugh and after she had talked it all over with John who said
it was certainly very kind of the woman and that Olivers people were
evidently nobs but of course Madge couldnt go not knowing any of
them Margaret took a sheet of plain white paper from her desk thanked
Miss Clendenning for her kind thought of her and declined the honor in
a firm round hand This she closed with a red wafer and then with a
little bridling of her head and a determined look in her face she laid
the letter on the gatepost ready for the early stage in the morning

This missive was duly received by Miss Clendenning and read at once to
Mrs Horn who raised her eyebrows and pursed her lips in deep thought
After some moments she looked over her glasses at Miss Lavinia and said

I must say Lavinia I am very greatly astonished Wont come She has
done perfectly right I think all the better of her for it Really
there may be something in the girl after all Let me look at her
handwriting againwrites like a woman of some force Wont come What
do you think Lavinia

Merely a question of grandmothers my dear she seems to have had one
too answered the little old maid with a quizzical smile in her eye
as she folded the letter and slipped it in her pocket




CHAPTER XVIII

THE LAST HOURS OF A CIVILIZATION


Margarets decision saddened Olivers last days at home and he
returned to New York with none of his former buoyancy Here other
troubles began to multiply Before the autumn was gone Morton Slade 
Co unable longer to make headway against the financial difficulties
that beset them went to the wall involving many of their
fellowmerchants Oliver lost his situation in consequence and was
forced to support himself during the long dreary winter by making
lithographic drawings for Bianchi at prices that barely paid his
board His loneliness in the garret room became more intense Fred
being much away and the occupants of the other rooms being either
strangers to him or so uncongenial that he would not make their
acquaintance

To his own troubles were added other anxieties The political outlook
had become even more gloomy than the financial The roar of Sumters
guns had reverberated throughout the land and men of all minds were
holding their breath and listening with ears to the ground for the
sound of the next shot Even Margarets letters were full of
foreboding Father is more bitter against the South than ever she
wrote He says if he had ten sons each should shoulder a musket We
must wait Ollie dear I can only talk to mother about you Father
wont listen and I never mention your name before him Not because it
is you Ollie but because you represent a class whom he hates Dear
John would listen but he is still in Boston Even his fellowclassmen
want to fight he says I fear all this will hurt my work and keep me
from painting

These letters of Margarets sad as they were were his greatest and
sometimes his only comfort She knew his ups and downs and they must
have no secrets from each other From his mother however he kept all
records of his privations during these troublous months Neither his
father nor his dear mother must deprive themselves for his benefit

During these dreary days he often longed for Kennedy Square and for
those whom he loved but it was not until one warm spring day when the
grass was struggling into life and the twigs on the scraggy trees in
Union Square were growing pink and green with impatient buds and leaves
that he had his wish Then a startling telegram summoned him It read
as follows

Father ill Come at once

Mother

Instinctively Oliver felt in his pockets for his purse There was just
money enough to take him to Kennedy Square and back

His mother met him at the door

It was only a fainting turn my son were her first words I am
sorry I sent for you Your father is himself again so Dr Wallace
says He has been working too hard latelysometimes far into the
night I could have stopped you from coming but somehow I wanted
you and she held him close in her arms and laid her cheek against
his I get so lonely my boy and feel so helpless sometimes

The weak and strong were changing places She felt the man in him now

Nathan was in the library He and Malachi had been taking turns at
Richards bedside Malachi had not closed his eyes all night Nathan
came out into the hall when he heard Olivers voice and put his hand
on his shoulder

We had a great scare Ollie he said but hes all right again
thank God Hes asleep nowbetter not wake him Then he put on his
coat and went home

Malachi shook his head Sumpins de matter wid him an dis aint de
las ob it Drapped jes like a shote when hes hit Marse Oliver he
said in a low whisper as if afraid of disturbing his master on the
floor above I was alayin out his cloes an he called quick like
Malachi Malachi an when I got dar he was lyin on de flo wid his
head on de mat I aint nebber seen Marse Richard do like dat befo
The old servant trembled as he spoke He evidently did not share
Nathans hopeful views Neither did Dr Wallace although he did not
say so to anyone

Their fears however were not realized Richard not only revived but
by the end of the week he was in the drawingroom again Malachi in
accordance with the timehonored custom wheeling out his chair
puffing up the cushions and with a wave of the hand and a sweeping
bow saying

Yo chars all ready Marse Richard Hope youse feelin fine dis
evenin sah

The following day he was in his lil room Oliver helping him It
was the lifting of the heavy plate of the motor that had hurt Richard
so Nathan told him not the same motor which Oliver remembered
another much larger and built on different lines The inventor now
used twentyfour cells instead of ten and the magnets had been wrapped
with finer wire

These days in the shop were delightful to Oliver His father no longer
treated him as an inexperienced youth but as his equal I hope you
will agree with me my son he would say or What do you think of
the idea of using a cam here instead of a lever or I wish you
would find the last issue of the Review and tell me what you think of
that article of Latrobes He puts the case very clearly it seems to
me etc And Oliver would bend his head in attention and try to follow
his fathers lead wishing all the time that he could really be of use
to the man he revered beyond all others and so lighten some of the
burdens that were weighing him down

And none the less joyful were the hours spent with his mother All the
oldtime affection the devotion of a loverson were lavished upon
her And she was so supremely happy in it all Now that Richard had
recovered there was no other cloud on her horizon not even that of
the dreaded mortgage which owing to some payments made Richard by a
company using one of his patents had been extended and its interest
paid for two years in advance in deference to her urgent request All
anxiety as to the Northern girl had happily passed out of her mind If
Oliver intended marrying Miss Grant he would have told her she knew
Then again he was so much stronger and wiser nowso much more
thoughtful than he had beenso much more able to keep his head in
matters of this kind

As his position was different with his father in the lil room and
with his mother in the stillness of her chamberfor often they talked
there together until far into the nightso were his relations altered
with his old friends and neighbors in the drawingroom While the young
men and girls filled the house as had always been their custom the
older men as well now paid their respects to Richard Horns son

One of our own kind Judge Bowman said to Richard Does you credit
Horna son to be proud of

Even Amos Cobb came to look him over a courtesy which pleased Richard
who greatly admired the Vermonter and who had not hesitated to express
his good opinion of him on more than one occasion before his own and
Cobbs friends

A man of force gentlemen Richard had said of great kindness of
heart and with a wide range of vision One who has the clearest ideas
of what makes for the good of his country a man too not ashamed of
his opinions and with ample courage to defend them He deserves our
unqualified respect not our criticism

When Cobb heard of Richards outspoken defence of him he at once called
on the inventor at his workshopa thing he had not done for mouths
and asked to see the motor and that same night astonished the circles
about the club tables by remarking in a tone of voice loud enough for
everybody to hear We have all been wrong about Horn He has got hold
of something that will one day knock steam higher than Gilderoys
kite A friendship was thus established between the two which had
become closer every daythe friendship of a clearer understanding one
which was unbroken during the rest of their lives

It was quite natural therefore that Amos Cobb should be among
Olivers earliest callers He must have been pleased with his
inspection for he took occasion at the club to say to Colonel Clayton
in his quick crisp way

Dropped in at Horns last night His boys over from New York Looks
like a different man since he quit fooling round here a couple of years
ago Clean cut a young fellow as Ive seen for many a day Got a look
out of his eyes like his mothers Levelheaded woman his motherno
better anywhere If all the young bloods South had Oliver Horns ideas
we might pull through this crisis

To which my Lord Chesterfield of Kennedy Square merely replied only
with a nod of the head and a drawing together of the eyebrows He found
it difficult to tolerate the Vermonter in these days with his continued
tirades against The epidemic of insanity sweeping over the South as
Cobb would invariably put it


The scribe now reaches a night in Olivers career fraught with such
momentous consequences that he would be glad to leave its story untold

An unforgettable night indeed both for those who were assembled there
and for him who is the chronicler He would fain lay down his pen to
recall again the charm and the sweetness and the oldtime flavor of
that drawingroom the soft lights of the candles the perfume of the
lilacs coming in through the halfopen windows the merry laugh of the
joyous girl running through the Square to be ushered by Malachi a
moment later into the presence of her hostess there to make her
courtesied obeisance before she joined a group of young people around
one of the red damaskcovered sofas And then Richard dear Richard
with his white hair and his gracious speech and Miss Clendenning with
her manners of foreign courts and the sweetvoiced hostess of the
mansion moving about among her guests her guests who were her
neighbors and her friends whose children were like her own and whose
joys and sorrows were hersguests neighbors friends many of whom
after this fatal night were to be as enemies never to assemble again
with the oldtime harmony and love

Malachi had brewed the punch the little squat glasses were set out
beside the Canton china bowl for it was the night of the weekly
musical and an unusually brilliant company had assembled in honor of
Olivers arrival and of Richards recovery

The inventor was to play his own interpretations of Handels Largo a
favorite selection of Ole Bull and one which the inventor and the
great virtuoso had played together some years before

Miss Clendenning had taken her place at the piano Nathan standing
beside her to turn the leaves of the accompaniment

Richard had picked up his violin tucked it under his chin poised the
bow and that peculiar hush which always precedes the sounding of the
first notes on evenings of this kind had already fallen upon the room
when there came a loud rap at the front door that startled everyone and
the next instant Colonel Clayton burst in his cheeks flaming his hat
still on his head

Ten thousand Yankees will be here in the morning Horn he gasped
out of breath with his run across the Square holding one hand to his
side as he spoke and waving an open telegram in the other Stop This
is no time for fiddling Theyre not going round by water theyre
coming here by train Read that and he held out the bit of paper

The Colonels sudden entrance and the startling character of the news
had brought every man to his feet

Richard laid down his violin read the telegram quietly and handed it
back

Well suppose they do come Clayton

His voice was so sustained and his manner so temperate that a certain
calming reassurance was felt

Suppose they DO come Theyll burn the town I tell you shouted the
infuriated man suddenly remembering his hat and handing it to Malachi
Thats what theyre coming for We want no troops in our streets and
the Government ought to know it Its an outrage to send armed men here
at this time

Youre all wrong Clayton answered Richard without raising his
voice You have always been wrong about this matter There are two
sides to this question Virginia troops occupied Harpers Ferry
yesterday If the authorities consider that more troops are needed to
protect Washington thats their affair not yours nor mine

Well MAKE it our affair What right has this damnable Government to
march their troops through a free and sovereign State without its
permission Whom do they think this town belongs to I want to know
that this Northern scum should foul it Not a man shall set foot here
if I can help it I would rather

Richard turned to stay the torrent of invectives in which such words as
renegades traitors mudsills were heard but the Colonel
completely unmanned by the rage he was in and seemingly unconscious of
the presence of the ladies waved him aside with his hand and faced
the row of frightened expectant faces

Gentlemen when you are through with this tomfoolery I shall be glad
if you will come to the club any of you who have got guns had better
look them up theyll be wanted before this is over Well meet these
dirty skinflints with cold lead and plenty of it

Olivers face flushed at the Colonels words and he was about to
speak when his mother laid her hand on his arm Visions of the kindly
face of Professor Cummings and the strong wellknit figure of Fred
Stone John Grant Hank Jonathan Gordon and the others whom he loved
came before his eyes

Richard raised his hand in protest

You are mad Clayton you dont know what you are doing Stop these
troops and our streets will run blood I beg and beseech you to keep
cool Because South Carolina has lost her head that is no reason why
we should This is not our fight If my State called me to defend her
against foreign invasion old as I am I would be ready and so should
you But the Government is part of ourselves and should not be looked
upon as an enemy You are wrong I tell you Clayton

Wrong or right theyll have to walk over my dead body if they attempt
to cross the streets of this town Thats my right as a citizen and
that I shall maintain Gentlemen I have called a meeting at the club
at ten oclock tonight All of you able to carry a gun will do me the
kindness to be present Id rather die right here in my tracks than let
a lot of lowlived mudsills who never entered a gentlemans house in
their lives come down here at the beck and call of this railsplitter
theyve put in the White House and walk over us roughshod And you
Horn a Virginian defend it By God sir its enough to make a mans
blood boil

The inventors eyes flashed They blazed now as brightly as those of
Clayton Not even a lifelong friend had the right to use such language
in his presence or in that of his guests Richards figure grew tense
with indignation Confronting the now reckless man he raised his hand
and was about to order him out of the house when Oliver stepped quickly
in front of his father

You are unjust Colonel Clayton The words came slowly between the
boys partly closed teeth You know nothing of these people I have
lived among them long enough not only to know but to love them There
are as many gentlemen North as South If you would go among them as I
have done you would be man enough to admit it

The Colonel turned upon him with a snarl

And so you have become a dirty renegade have you and gone back on
your blood and your State Thats what comes of sending boys like you
away from home

The guests stood amazed The spectacle of the most courteous man of his
time acting like a blackguard was more astounding than the news he had
brought Even Malachi at the open door trembled with fear

As the words fell from his lips Mrs Horns firm clear voice crying
Shame Shame rang through the room She had risen from her seat and
was walking rapidly to where the Colonel was standing

Shame I say John Clayton How dare you speak so What has our young
son ever done to you that you should insult him in his fathers house
What madness has come over you

The horrified guests looked from one to the other Every eye was fixed
on the Colonel shaking with rage

For a brief instant he faced his hostess started to speak checked
himself as if some better judgment prevailed and with upraised hands
flung himself from the room shouting as he went

Ten oclock gentlemen Chesapeake Club Every man with a gun

Richard astounded at Claytons action and now thoroughly convinced of
the danger of the situation and determined to do what he could to
thwart the efforts of such men as the Colonel and his following laid
his violin in its case turned to his frightened guests and with a few
calming words and a promise to send each one of them word if any
immediate danger existed called Oliver and Nathan to him and taking
his cloak and hat from Malachis outstretched trembling hands started
for the club Once outside it was easy to see that a feeling of intense
and ominous excitement was in the air Even on the sidewalk and on the
street corners men stood silent huddled together their eyes on the
ground the situation being too grave for spoken words

On arriving they found its halls already filled with angry and excited
men discussing the threatened invasion many of whom met the young man
with scowling looks the Colonel having evidently informed them of
Olivers protest

A few of the members had brought their sporting guns These had been
handed to the gouty old porter who halffrightened out of his wits
had stacked them in a row against the wall of the outer hall Billy
Talbot arrived a few moments later carrying a heavy fowlingpiece
loaded for swan He had been dining out when summoned and had hurriedly
left the table excusing himself on the ground that he had been called
to arms He had taken time however to stop at his own house slip
out of his English dresssuit and into a brown ducking outfit

Well shoot em on the run damn emlike rabbits sir he said to
Cobb as he entered the Vermonter being the only man likely to
communicate with the invaders and so make known the warlike intentions
of at least one citizen and the utter hopelessness of any prolonged
resistance Waggles who had followed close on his masters heels was
too excited to sit down but stood on three legs his eye turned toward
Talbot as if wanting to pick up any game which Billys trusty
fowlingpiece might bring down

A quiet repressed smile passed over Olivers face as he watched
Waggles and his master but he spoke no word to the Nimrod He could
not help thinking how Hank Pollard would handle the fashionplate if he
ever closed his great bony hands upon him

Judge Bowman now joined the group bowing to Richard rather coldly and
planting himself squarely in front of Oliver

Theres only one side to this question young man for you he said
Dont be fooled by those fellow up in New York I know themknown
them for years Look up thereand he pointed to the portrait of
Olivers ancestor above the mantel What do you think he would do if
he were alive today Stick to your own my boystick to your own

General Mactavish now hurried in drawing off his white gloves as he
entered the room followed by Tom Gunning Carter Thorn and Mowbray
an upcountry man The four had been dining together and had also left
the table on receipt of the Colonels message They evidently
appreciated the gravity of the situation for they stood just outside
the excited group that filled the centre of the large room listening
eagerly to Richards clear tones pleading for moderationin a crisis
which he urged required the greatest public restraint and
selfcontrol and which would surely plunge the State into the most
horrible of wars if those about him listened to the counsels of such
men as Clayton and Judge Bowman

During the whole discussion Amos Cobb stood silent leaning against the
mantelpiece his cold gray eyes fixed on the excited throng his thin
lips curling now and then When the Defence Committee in spite of
Richards protest had at last been formed and its members formally
instructed to meet the enemy outside the city and protest first by
voice and then if necessary by arms against the unwarrantable
invasion of the soil of their State the Vermonter buttoned up his coat
slowly one button after another fastened each one with a determined
gesture drew on his gloves set his lips tight singled out Oliver and
Richard shook their hands with the greatest warmth and walked
straight out of the clubhouse Some time during the night he drove in
a hack to Mr Stigers house roused the old cashier from his sleep
took him and the big walledtownkey down to the bank unlocked the
vault and dragged from it two wooden boxes filled with gold coin his
own property and which the month before he had deposited there for
safekeeping These with Stigers assistance he carried to the hack
Within the hour the two boxes with their contents were locked up in
bureaudrawer in his own house awaiting their immediate shipment to New
York


The next morning Malachis wizened face was thrust inside Olivers
bedroom door He was shaking with terror his eyes almost starting from
his head

Marse Ollie Marse Ollie git up quick as you kin De Yankees is come
de town is black wid em

Oliver sprang from his bed and stood halfdazed looking into Malachis
eyes

How do you know Who told you

I done seen em Been up since daylight Dey got guns wid em Fo
Gawd dis is turble The old mans voice trembledhe could hardly
articulate

Oliver hurried into his clothes stepped noiselessly downstairs so as
not to wake his father and mother and closing the front door softly
behind him stood for a moment on the top step Should he forget the
insults of the night before and go straight to Colonel Clayton and try
to dissuade him from his purpose or should he find the regiment and
warn them of their danger

A vague sense of personal responsibility for whatever the day might
bring forth took possession of himas though the turningpoint in his
life had come without his altogether realizing it These men from the
North were coming to his own town where he had been born and brought
up and where they should be hospitably received If Clayton had his
way they would be met with clenched hands and perhaps with blows That
these invaders were armed and that each man carried forty rounds of
ammunition and was perfectly able to take care of himself did not
impress him He only remembered that they were of the same blood as the
men who had befriended him and that they were in great personal danger

The angry shouts of a crowd of men and boys approaching the Square from
a side street now attracted his attention They rushed past Oliver
without noticing him and hurrying on through the gate crossed the
park in the direction of the railroad station and the docks One of
the mob lacking a club stopped long enough to wrench a paling from
the rickety fence enclosing the Square trampling the pretty crocuses
and the yellow tulips under foot Each new arrival seeing the gap
followed the first mans example throwing the branches and tendrils to
the ground as they worked until the whole panel was wrecked and the
vines were torn from their roots As they swept by the Clayton house
half a dozen men led by the Colonel ran down the steps and joined
the throng

Oliver seeing now that all his efforts for peace would be hopeless
ran through the Square close behind the shouting mob dashed down a
side street parallel to that through which the cars carrying the troops
were to pass on their way to Washington turned into an alley and
found himself on the waterfront opposite one of the dock slips

These slips were crowded with vessels their bowsprits like huge
bayonets thrust out over the cartracks as if to protect the cellars
of the opposite warehouses used by the shipchandlers for the storage
of coarse merchandise and always left open during the day The narrow
strip of dockfront between the cartracks and the waterlinean
unpaved strip of foottrodden earth and rotting planks on which lay
enormous shipanchors anchorchains in coils piles of squared timber
and other maritime properties stored here for yearswas now a
seething mass of people completely hiding the things on which they
stood

Oliver mounted a pile of barrels in front of one of these shipchandler
cellars and holding to an awningpost looked off over the heads of
the surging crowd and in the direction of the railroad station at the
end of the long street From his position on the top barrel he could
see the white steam of the locomotives rising above the buildings and
the line of cars He could see too a yard engine backing and puffing
as if making up a train

Suddenly without apparent cause there rose above the murmurs of the
street an ominous sound like that of a fierce wind soughing through a
forest of pines All eyes were directed down the long street upon a
line of cars that had been shunted on the streettrack about these
moved a group of men in blue uniforms the sun flashing on their
bayonets and the brass shields of their belts

Oliver stirred by the sound climbed to the top of the awningpost for
a better view and clung to the crosspiece Every man who could gain an
inch of vantage roused to an extra effort by the distinct roar took
equal advantage of his fellows Sailors sprang farther into the rigging
or crawled out to the end of the bowsprits the windows of the
warehouses were thrown up the clerks and employees standing on the
sills balancing themselves by the shutters even the skylights were
burst open men and boys crawling out edging their way along the
ridgepoles of the roofs or holding to the chimneys Every inch of
standingroom was black with spectators

The distant roar died away in fitful gusts as suddenly as it had
arisen and a silence even more terrifying fell upon the throng as a
body of police poured out of a side street and marched in a compact
body toward the cars

Then came long strings of horses eight or ten in tandem These were
backed down and hooked to the cars

The flash of bayonets was now cut off as the troops crowded into the
cars the body of police wheeled and took their places ahead of the
horses the tandems straightened out and the leaders lunged forward
under the lash The advance through the town had begun

All this time the mob about Oliver stood with hands clenched jaws
tight shut great lumps in their throats Their eyes were the eyes of
hungry beasts watching an approaching prey

As the distant rumbling of the cars drawn by teams of straining
horses sounded the nearer a bareheaded man with white hair and
mustache and black garments that distinguished him from the mob about
him and whom Oliver instantly recognized as Colonel Clayton mounted a
mass of squared timber lining the track ran the length of the pile
climbed to the topmost stick and shouted in a voice which
reverberated throughout the street

Block the tracks

A torrent of oaths broke loose as the words left his lips and a rush
was made for the pile of timber Men struggled and fought like demons
for the end of the great sticks carrying them by main strength
crossing them over the rails heaping them one on the other like a pile
of huge jackstraws a dozen men to a length the mobs on the
housetops and in the windows cheering like mad The ends of the heavy
chains resting on the strip of dirt were now caught up and hauled along
the cobbles to be intertwined with the squared timber anchors weighing
tons were pried up and dragged across the tracks by lines of men urged
on by grayhaired old merchants in Quakercut dress coats many of them
bareheaded who had yielded to the sudden unaccountable delirium that
had seized upon everyone Colonel Clayton Carter Thom and Mowbray
could be seen working side by side with stevedores from the docks and
the rabble from the shipyards John Camblin a millionnaire and nearly
eighty years of age head of the largest East India house on the
wharves his hat and wig gone his coat split from the collar to the
tails was tugging at an anchor ten men could not have moved Staid
citizens men who had not used an oath for years stood on the
sidewalks swearing like streettoughs others looked out from their
officewindows the tears streaming down their cheeks A woman with a
coarse shawl about her shoulders her hair hanging loose a broom in
one hand was haranguing the mob from the top of a tobacco hogshead
her curses filling the air

Oliver held to his seat on the crosspiece of the awning his teeth
set his eye fixed on the rapidly advancing cars his mind wavering
between two opinionsloyalty to his home now invaded by troops whose
bayonets might be turned upon his own people and loyalty to the
friends he lovedand to the woman who loved him

The shouting now became a continuous roar The front line of policemen
as they neared the obstructions swung their clubs right and left
beating back the crowd Then the rumbling cars drawn by the horses
came to a halt The barricades must be reckoned with

Again there came the flashing of steel and the intermingling of blue
and white uniforms The troops were leaving the cars and were forming
in line to pass the barricades the officers marching in front the
compact mass following elbow to elbow their eyes straight before them
their muskets flat against their shoulders

The approaching column now deployed sharply wheeled to the right of
the obstruction and became once more a solid mass leaving the
barricades behind them the Chief of Police at the head of the line
forcing the mob back to the curbstone laying about him with his club
thumping heads and cracking wrists as he cleared the way

The colonel of the regiment his fatigue cap pulled over his eyes
sword in hand shoulders erect cape thrown back was now abreast of
the awning to which Oliver clung Now and then he would glance
furtively at the housetops as if expecting a missile

The mob looked on sullenly awed into submission by the gleaming
bayonets But for the shouts of the police beating back the crowd and
the muttered curses one would have thought a parade was in progress

The first company had now passedpale haggardlooking men their lips
twitching showing little flecks of dried saliva caked in the corners
of their mouths their hands tight about the butts of their muskets

Oliver looked on with beating heart The dull monotonous tramp of
their feet strangely affected him

As the second line of bayonets came abreast of the awningpost a
blacksmith in a red shirt and leather apron his arms bared to the
elbow sprang from the packed sidewalk into the open space between the
troops and the gutter lifted a paving stone high above his head and
hurled it with all his might straight against the soldier nearest
him The man reeled clutched at the comrade next him and sank to the
ground Then quick as an echo a puff of white smoke burst out down
the line of troops and a sharp ringing report split the air The
first shot of defence had been fired

The whole column swayed as if breasting a gale

Another and an answering shot now rang through the street This came
from a window filled with men gesticulating wildly Instantly the
troop wheeled raised their muskets and a line of fire and smoke
belched forth

A terrible fear that paled mens faces followed by a moment of
ominous silence seized upon the mob and then a wild roar burst out
from thousands of human throats The rectangular body of soldiers and
the raggededged mob merged into a common mass Men wrenched the guns
from the soldiers and beat them down with the butt ends of the muskets
Frenzied policemen hurled themselves into the midst of the disorganized
militia knocking up the ends of their muskets begging the men to hold
their fire The air was thick with missiles bricks from the
housetops sticks of wood and coal from the fireplaces of the offices
iron bolts castings anything the crazed mob could find with which to
kill their fellowmen The roar was deafening drowning the orders of
the officers

Oliver clung to his post not knowing whether to drop into the seething
mass or to run the risk of being shot where he was Suddenly his eye
singled out a soldier who stood at bay below him swinging his musket
widening the circle about him with every blow The soldiers movements
were hampered by his heavy overcoat and army blanket slung across his
shoulder His face and neck were covered with blood and dirt
disfiguring him beyond recognition

At the same instant Oliver became conscious that a man in blue overalls
was creeping up on the soldiers rear to brain him with a cartrung
that he held in his hand

A mist swam before the boys eyes and a great lump rose in his throat
The cowardice of the attack incensed him some of the hot blood of the
old ancestor that had crossed the flood at Trenton flamed up in his
face With the quickness of a cat he dropped to the sidewalk darted
forward struck the coward full in the face with his clenched fist
tumbling him to the ground wrenched the rung from his hands and
jumping in front of the now almost overpowered soldier swung the heavy
stick about him like a flail clearing the space before him

The assaulting crowd wavered fell back and then maddened at Olivers
defence of the invader with a wild yell of triumph swept the two
young men off their feet throwing them bodily down the steps of a
shipchandlers shop the soldier knocked senseless by a blow from a
brick which had struck him full in the chest

Oliver lay still for a moment raised his head cautiously and putting
forth all his strength twisted his arms around the stricken man and
rolled with him into the cellar Then springing to his feet he
slammed the door behind them and slipped in the bolt before the mob
could guess his meaning

Listening at the crack of the door for a moment and finding they were
not pursued he stood over the limp body lifted it in his arms laid
it on a pile of sails and ran to the rear of the cellar for a bucket
standing under a grimy window scarcely visible in the gloom now that
the door was shut

Under the touch of the cold water the soldier slowly opened his eyes
straining them toward Oliver as if in pain

The two men looked intently at each other the soldier passing his
hand across his forehead as if trying to clear his brain Then lifting
himself up on his elbow he gasped

Horn Horn My God

Olivers heart stopped beating

Who are you

John Grant

Oliver saw only Margarets face

As though he were working for the woman he loveddoing what she would
have donehe knelt beside the wounded man wiped the blood and grime
from his cheeks with his own handkerchief loosening his coat rubbing
his hands murmuring Old fellow Dear John  there was no time for
other interchange of speech

When at last Grant was on his feet the two men barricaded the doors
more strongly rolling heavy barrels against them the sounds from the
street seeming to indicate that an attack might be made upon them But
the mob had swept on and forgotten them as mobs often do while the
fugitives waited hardly daring to speak except in detached whispers
lest some one of the inmates of the warehouse overhead might hear them

Toward noon a low tap was heard at the window which was level with an
alley in the rear and a mans hand was thrust through a broken pane
Oliver pressed Grants arm laid his finger on his lips caught up a
heavy hammer lying on an oilbarrel crept noiselessly along the wall
toward the sound and stopped to listen Then he heard his name called
in a hoarse whisper

Marse Ollie Marse Ollie Is you in here

Who is it Oliver called back crouching beneath the window his
fingers tight around the handle of the hammer

Its me Marse Ollie

You Malachi

Yassir Ise been afollowin ye all de mawnin I see em tryin to
kill ye an I tried to git to ye I kin git throughyer neednt help
me and he squeezed himself under the raised sash Malachi like de
snakecrawl through anywheres An ye aint hurted he asked when he
was inside De bressed Lord aint dat good I been awaitin outside
I was feared deyd see me if I tried de door

Where are the soldiers

Gone Aint nobody outside at all Mos to de railroad by dis time
dey tells me An dere aint nary soul bout dis placeall run away
Come long wid me sonI aint gwine ter leabe ye a minute Marse
Richardll be waitin Come long home son I been afollowin ye all
de mawnin The tears were in his eyes now An ye aint hurted and
he felt him all over with trembling hands

John raised himself above the oilbarrels He had heard the strange
talk and was anxiously watching the approaching figures

Its all right Grantits our Malachi Oliver called out in his
natural voice now that there was no danger of being overheard

The old man stopped and lifted both hands above his head

Goramighty an he aint dead His eyes had now become accustomed
to the gloom

No and just think Mally he is my own friend Grant this is our
Malachi whom I told you about

Grant stepped over the barrel and held out his hand to the old negro
There are no class distinctions where life and death are concerned

Glad to see you Pretty close shave but I guess Im all right Theyd
have done for me but for your master

A council of war was now held The uniform would be fatal if Grant were
seen in it on the street Malachi must crawl into the alley again go
over to Olivers house and return at dusk with one of Olivers suits
of clothes the uniform and the bloodstained shirt could then be
hidden in the cellar and at dark should the street still be deserted
the three would put on a bold front and walk out of the front door of
the main warehouse over their heads Once safe in the Horn house they
could perfect plans for Grants rejoining his regiment

Their immediate safety provided for and Malachi gone Oliver could
wait no longer to ask about Margaret He had been turning over in his
mind how he had best broach the subject when her brother solved the
difficulty by saying

Father was the first man in Brookfleld to indorse the Presidents call
for troops Hed have come himself old as he is if I had not joined
the regiment He didnt like you Horn I always told him he was wrong
Hell never forgive himself now when he hears what you have done for
me and he laid his hand affectionately on Olivers shoulder as he
spoke I liked you as soon as I saw you and so did mother and so
does Madge but father was always wrong about you We told him so
again and again and Madge said that father would see some day that you
got your politeness from the Cavaliers and we got our plain speaking
from the Puritans The old gentleman was pretty mad about her saying
so I tell you but she stuck to it Madge is a dear girl Horn A
fellow always knows just where to find Madge no nonsense about her
Shes grown handsome toohandsomer than ever Theres a new look in
her face somehow lately I tell her shes met somebody in New York
she likes but she wont acknowledge it

Oliver drank in every word drawing out the brother with skilful
questions and little exclamatory remarks that filled Grant with
enthusiasm and induced him to talk on They were young men again
nowbrothers once more as they had been that first afternoon in the
library at Brookfield In the joy of hearing from her he entirely
forgot his surroundings and the dangers that still beset them both a
joy intensified because it was the first and only time he had heard
someone who knew her talk to him of the woman he loved This went on
until night fell and Malachi again crawled in through the same low
window and helped John into Olivers clothes

When all was ready the main door of the warehouse above was opened
carefully and the three men walked outMalachi ahead John and Oliver
following The moonlit street was deserted only the barricades of
timber and the litter of stones and bricks marked the events of the
morning Dodging into a side alley and keeping on its shadow side they
made their way toward Olivers home

When the three reached the Square the white light of the moon lay full
on the bleached columns of the Clayton house Outside on the porch
resting against the wall stood a row of longbarrelled guns glinting
in the moons rays Through the open doorway could be seen the glow of
the hall lantern the hall itself crowded with men The Horn house was
dark except for a light in Mrs Horns bedroom The old servants
visit had calmed their fears and they had only to wait now until
Olivers return

Malachi stationed Oliver and John Grant in the shadow of the big
sycamore that overhung the house mounted the marble steps and knocked
twice Aunt Hannah opened the door She seemed to be expecting someone
for the knock was instantly followed by the turning of the knob

Malachi spoke a few words in an undertone to Hannah and stepped back
to where the two young men were standing

You go in Marse Oliver Leabe de gemman here wid me under de tree
Everybodys got dere eye wide open nowcant fool MalachiI knows de
signs

Oliver walked leisurely to the door closed it softly behind him and
ran upstairs into his mothers arms

Malachi whispered to Grant and the two disappeared in the shadows At
the same moment a bolt shot back in a gate in the rear of the yarda
gate rarely unbolted Old Hannah stood behind it shading a candle with
her hand Malachi led the way across the yard through the green door
of Richards shop mounted the workbench felt carefully along the
edge of a trapdoor in the ceiling unhooked a latch pushed it up with
his two hands the dust sifting down in showers on his head and
disclosed a large empty loft once used by the slaves as a
sleepingroom and which had not been opened for years

Assisted by the negros arms Grant climbed to the floor above where a
dim skylight gave him light and air A cup of hot coffee was then
handed up and the door of the trap carefully fastened Malachi rumpling
the shavings on the workbench to conceal the dust No trace of the
hidingplace of the fugitive was visible

When Malachi again reached the front hall it was in response to
someone who was hammering at the door as if to break it down The old
man peered cautiously out through the small panes of glass The
sidewalk was crowded with men led by Colonel Clayton most of them
carrying guns They had marched over from Claytons house Among them
was a posse of detectives from the Police Department

In answer to their summons Richard had thrown up the window of his
bedroom and was talking to Clayton whose voice Malachi recognized
above the murmurs and threats of the small mob

Come down Horn Oliver has proved traitor just as I knew he would
Hes been hiding one of these damned Yankees all day We want that man
I tell you dead or alive and we are going to have him

When the door was flung wide Clayton confronted not Richard but
Oliver

Wheres that Yankee cried Clayton He had not expected to see
Oliver We are in no mood for nonsensewhere have you hidden him

Malachi stepped forward before Oliver could answer

Marse Oliver aint hid him If you want him go hunt him

You speak like that to me you black scoundrel burst out the
Colonel and he raised his arm as if to strike him

Yesme Aint nobody gwine ter tech Marse Oliver while I lib Is as
free as you is Marse Clayton Aint no man can lay a han on me

The Colonel wheeled angrily and gave an order to one of the detectives
in a low voice Oliver stood irresolute He knew nothing of Grants
whereabouts

The detective moved from the Colonels side and pushed his way closer
to where Oliver stood

Theres no use your denying it young feller weve heard the whole
story from one of our men who saw you jump in front of him You bring
him out or well go through the place from cellar to garret

Oliver gazed straight at the speaker and still held his peace He was
wondering where Grant had hidden himself and what Johns chances were
if the crowd searched the house Malachis outburst had left him in the
dark

Mrs Horn and Richard who had followed Oliver and were standing half
way down the stairs looked on in astonishment Would Clayton dare to
break all the rules of good manners and search the house she
whispered to Richard

Another of the detectives now stepped forwarda dark uglylooking
man with the face of a bulldog

Look here Ill settle this You and two men crossed the Square ten
minutes ago This nigger one of em wheres the other

Malachi turned and smiled significantly at Olivera smile he knew It
was the smile which the old mans face always wore whenever some
tortuous lie of the darkys own concoction had helped his young master
out of one of his scrapes

I am not here to answer your questions Oliver replied quietly a
feeling of relief in his heart

The officer turned quickly and said with an oath to one of the
detectives Send one man to the alley in the rear and place another
at this door Ill search the yard and the house Let no one of the
family leave this hall If that nigger moves put the irons on him

The men outside made a circle about the house some of them moving up
the alley to watch the rear Clayton leaned against the jamb of the
door He addressed no word to Richard or Mrs Horn nor did he look
their way Oliver stood with folded arms under the eightsided
halllantern which an officer had lighted Now and then he spoke in
restrained tones to his mother who had taken her seat on the stairs
Richard standing beside her It was not the fate of the soldier that
interested herit was the horror of the search Richard had not spoken
except to direct Malachi to obey the officers orders The horror of
the search did not affect the inventorthat only violated the sanctity
of the home it was the brute force behind it which appalled himthat
might annihilate the Republic

It is the beginning of the end he said to himself

The tread of heavy feet was again heard coming through the hall
Malachi turned quickly and a subdued smile lighted his wrinkled face

The two detectives were alone

He is not there Colonel Clayton said the man with the bulldog
face slipping his pistol into his hip pocket We went through the
yard and the outhouses like a fine toothcomb and made a clean sweep
of the cellar He may have gotten over the wall but I dont think it
Theres a lot of broken bottles on top Ill try the bedrooms now

As the words fell from his lips Mrs Horn rose from her seat on the
stairs straight as a soldier on guard The light from the lantern
illumined her gray hair and threw into strong relief her upraised
handthe first of millions raised in protest against the invasion of
the homes of the South The detective saw the movement and a grim smile
came into his face

Unless theyll bring him out he added slowly This young feller
knows where he is Make him tell

Colonel Clayton turned to Oliver Is he upstairs Oliver

No

You give me your word of honor Oliver that he is not upstairs

I do

Of course hed say that Here Ill know pretty d quick muttered
the detective moving toward the stairway

The Colonel stepped forward and barred his way with his arm

Stay where you are You dont know these people If Oliver says he is
not upstairs I believe him These Horns dont know how to lie Your
information is wrong The man never entered the house You must look
for the Yankee somewhere else Waiting until the detectives had left
the hall he raised his hat and with some show of feeling said

I am sorry Sallie that we had to upset you so When you and Richard
see this matter in its true light youll think as I do If these
scoundrels are to be permitted to come here and burn our homes we want
to know which side our friends are on

You are the judge of your own conduct John Clayton she answered
calmly This nights work will follow you all your life Malachi show
Colonel Clayton to the door and close it behind him


Three nights later Malachi admitted a man he had never seen before He
was short and thickset and had a grim firmly set jaw Under the lapel
of his coat was a gold shield He asked for Mr Horn who had lately
been living in New York He would not come inside the drawingroom but
sat in the hall on the haircloth sofa his knees apart his cap in his
hand

Im the Chief of Police he said to Oliver without rising from his
seat and I come because Mr Cobb sent me Thats between ourselves
remember Youll have to get out of here at once Theyve got a yarn
started that youre a government detective sent down here to spot rebel
sympathizers and theyll make it warm for you Ive looked into it and
I know it aint so but this towns in no shape to listen to anything
Besides a while ago one of my men found your friends uniform in the
cellar where you hid it behind the barrels and the handkerchief all
blood with your name on it and theyve got you dead to rights
Thatll all be out in the morning papers and make it worse for you You
neednt worry about HIM Hes all right Mr Cobb found him at daylight
this morning just where your nigger left him and drove him over to the
junction Hes with his regiment by this time Get your things together
quick as you can Ill wait for you and see you safe aboard the owl
train

Within the hour Oliver had turned his back on his home and all that he
loved




CHAPTER XIX

THE SETTLING OF THE SHADOW


The bruised crocuses never again lifted their heads in Kennedy Square

With the settling of the shadowa shadow black with hatemen forgot
the perfume of flowers the rest and cool of shady nooks the kindling
touch of warm hands and stood apart with eyes askance women shuddered
and grew pale and sadfaced children peered out through closed blinds

Within the Square itself along paths that had once echoed to the tread
of slippered feet armed sentries paced their sharp challenges
breaking the stillness of the night Outside its wrecked fences strange
men in stranger uniforms strode in and out of the joyless houses tired
pickets stacked their arias on the unswept piazzas and panting horses
nibbled the bark from the withered trees rank weeds choked the
gardens dishevelled vines clung to the porches and doors that had
always swung wide to the gentle tap of loving fingers were opened
timidly to the blow of the swordhilt

Kennedy Square became a tradition

Some civilizations die slowly This one was shattered in a day by a
pavingstone in the hands of a thug




CHAPTER XX

THE STONE MUGS


Frederick Stone NA member of the Stone Mugs late war correspondent
and special artist on the spot paused before the cheerful blaze of his
studio fire shaking the wet snow from his feet He had tramped across
Washington Square in drifts that were over his shoetops mounted the
three flights of steps to his cosey rooms and was at the moment
expressing his views on the weather in terms more forcible than
polite to our very old friend Jack Bedford the famous
marinepainter Bedford on hearing the sound of Freds footsteps had
strolled in from his own studio in the same building and had thrown
himself into a big armchair where he was sitting hunched up his
knees almost touching his chin his round head covered by a skullcap
that showed above the chairback

Nice weather for ducks Jack isnt it Cant see how anybody can get
here tonight cried Fred striking the mantel with his wet cap and
scattering the raindrops over the hearth Just passed a Broadway
stage stuck in a hole as I came by the New York Hotel Been there an
hour they told me

Shouldnt wonder Whose night is it Fred asked Jack stretching out
one leg in the direction of the cheery blaze

Horns

Whats he going to do

Give it up Ask me an easy one Said he wanted a thirty by forty
There it is on the easel and Fred moved a chair out of his way hung
his wet coat and hat on a peg behind the door and started to clear up
a tangle of artillery harness that littered the floor

Thirty by forty eh grunted Jack from the depths of his chair
Thunder and Mars Is the beggar going to paint a panorama Thought
that canvas was for a new cavalry charge of yours He had lowered the
other leg now making a doublebarrelled gun of the pair

No its Horns Hes going to paint one of the fellows tonight

In costume Jacks head was now so low in the chair that his eyes
could draw a bead along his legs to the fire

Yes as an old Burgomaster or something with a ruff and he kicked
an army blanket into a corner as he spoke Theres the ruff hanging on
that pair of foils Waller sent it over Then his merry eyes fell on
Jacks sprawledout figure his feet almost in the gratea favorite
attitude of his neighbors when tired out with the days work
comfortable perhaps but especially objectionable at the moment

Hereget up you old stickinthemud Dont sit there doubled up
like a government mule he laughed The army lingo still showed
itself once in a while in Freds speech Help me get this room ready
or Ill whale you with this and he waved one end of a trace over his
head If the fellows are coming theyll be here in half an hour Shove
back that easel and bring in that beerits outside the door in a box
Ill get out the tobacco and pipes

Jack stretched both arms above his head emitted a yawn that could be
heard in his room below and sprang to his feet

Fred by this time had taken down from a closet a tin box of crackers
unwrapped a yellow cheese and was trimming its raw edges with a
palette knife Then they both moved out a big table from the inner room
to the larger one and while Jack placed the eatables on its bare top
Fred mounted a chair and began lighting a circle of gasjets that hung
from the ceiling of the skylight The warpainter was host tonight
and the task of arranging the rooms for the comfort of his
fellowmembers consequently devolved upon him

The refreshments having been made ready Fred roamed about the rooms
straightening the pictures on the wallsan old fad of his when guests
of any kind were expectedpunching the cushions and Turkish
saddlebags into plumpness that he had picked up in a flying trip
abroad the year the war was over and stringing them along the divan
ready for the backs and legs of the clubmembers Next he stripped the
piano of a collection of camp sketches that had littered it up for a
week dumped the pile into a closet and with a sudden wrench of his
arms whirled the instrument itself close against the wall Then some
firearms saddles and artillery trappings were hidden away in dark
corners and a lay figure clothed in fatigue cap and blue overcoat
and which had done duty as a picket during the day was wheeled
around with its face to the wall where it stood guard over Freds
famous picture of The Last Gun at Appomattox His final touches were
bestowed on the gratefire and the coalscuttle both of which were
replenished from a big pine box in the hall

Jack Bedford meanwhile had busied himself rolling another tablea
long oneunder the circle of gasjets so that the men could see to
work the better and loading it with palettes china tiles canvases
etc to be used by the members of the club in their work of the
evening Last of all and not by any means the least important Jack by
the aid of a chair gathered together on the top shelf of the closet
the unique collection of stone beermugs from which the club took its
name These he handed down one by one to Fred who arranged them in a
row on one end of the long table The mugs were to hold the contents of
sundry bottles of beer now safely stowed away in the lidless
pigeonholed box standing in the hall which Fred unloaded later
placing the bottles on the windowsill outside to cool

Before they had ended their preparations the stamping of feet on the
stair was heard the door was thrown back and the several members of
the club began to arrive

The great Waller came first brushing the snow from his shaggy coat
looking like a great bear growling as he rolled in as was his wont
Close behind him puffing with the run upstairs and halfhidden behind
Wallers broad shoulders trotted Simmons the musician

Not the tousled illclad Waller the Walrus of former daysno one
dared to call the painter by any such names since his picture took the
Medaille dHonneur at Parisand not the slender smoothfaced Simmons
who in the old days was content to take his chances of filling a
vacancy at Wallacks or the Winter Garden when some one of the regular
orchestra was under the weather but a sleek prosperous rotund
Waller with a bit of red in his buttonhole a wide expanse of
shirtfront and a waxed mustache and a thoughtful slightly bald and
welldressed Simmons with gold eyeglasses and his hair worn long in
his neck as befitted the leader of an orchestra whose concerts crowded
the Academy to the doors

These two arrivals nodded to Jack and Fred Waller cursing the weather
as he hung up his coat on a peg behind the door unnecessary
formalities of every kind including the shaking of hands and asking
after each others health were dispensed with by men who saw each
other several times a day at their different haunts and Simmons
without stopping to take off his wet coat flung his hat on the divan
crossed the room and seated himself at the piano

Went this way Waller didnt it said Simmons striking the keys
continuing the conversation the two had evidently had on the stairs
Never heard Parepa in better voice She filled every corner of the
house Crug told me he was up in Africa in the back row and never
missed a note Do you remember this and the musicians fingers again
slipped over the keys and one of the great singers trills rippled
through the room to which Waller nodded approvingly mopping his wet
face with his handkerchief as he listened

The opening and shutting of the door the stamping of feet the general
imprecations hurled at the climate and the scattering of wet snow and
raindrops about the entrance became constant Crug bustled ina
short thickset rosycheeked young fellow in a black mackintosh and a
white silk mufflera cellist of repute who had spent two years at
the conservatoire and who had once played for Eugenie at one of her
musicales at the Tuileries a fact he never let you forget And close
behind him came Watson the landscapepainter who had had two pictures
accepted by the Royal Academyone of them hung on the line a great
honor for an American and after them blueeyed roundfaced Munson a
pupil of Kaulbach and late from Munich as well as Harry Stedman
Post the artcritic and one or two others

Each man as he entered divested himself of his wet garments warmed his
hands at the blazing gratefire and reaching over the long table
picked up a clay or corncob pipe stuffing the bowl full of tobacco
from a cracked Japanese pot that stood on the mantel Then striking a
match he settled himself into the nearest chair joining in the general
talk or smoking quietly listening to what was being said about him
Now and then one would walk to the window raise the sash uncork a
bottle of beer where Fred had placed it empty its contents into one of
the mugs and resume his seatmug in one hand pipe in the other

Up to this time no work had been done the courtesies of the club
permitting none to begin until the member whose night it was had
arrived

As the halfhour slipped away the men began to grow restless

If its Horns night why the devil doesnt he come Fred asked
Waller in a querulous tone Although the great sheeppainter had lost
his sobriquet since the old days he had never parted with his right to
growl

Hell be here cried Simmons from his seat by the piano His fingers
were still rippling gently over the keys although he had stopped once
just long enough to strip off his wet overcoat I met him at Margaret
Grants this afternoon She had a little tea

There every afternoon isnt he Simmons asked Munson who was
smoking quietly

Shouldnt wonder came the response between the trills

Hows that affair coming on came a voice out of the tobaccosmoke

Same old way answered someone at the lower end of the tablestill
waiting for the spondulix

Seen her last picture remarked Watson knocking the ashes from his
pipe The one she scooped the medal with

Yes Rouser isnt it called out Waller Best thing she has done
yet Shes a great woman Hello there he is This is a pretty time for
him to put in an appearance

The door opened and Oliver walked in a wet umbrella in one hand his
coatcollar turned up his mustache beaded with melted snowdrops

Whats it doing outside Ollie raining cats and dogs Jack called
out

No going to clear up Its stopped snowing and getting colder Oh
what a night I love a storm like this it sets my blood tingling
Sorry to keep you waiting gentlemen but I couldnt help it It wont
make any difference I cant begin anyway Bianchi wont be here for
an hour Just met him on the streethes going to bring a guest he
says

Whos he going to bring shouted Simmons who had risen from his seat
at the piano and was now sorting out some sheets of music that Fred
had just laid on its top

He wont tell says its a surprise answered Oliver slipping off
his coat

A surprise is it grumbled Waller Ill bet its some greasy
foreigner He had left Simmonss side and was now standing by the
mantel filling a pipe from the bowl Bianchi has always got a lot of
cranks about him

Oliver hung his wet coat among the row of garments lining the wallhe
had come twice as far as the otherscrowded his dripping umbrella into
a broken Chinese jar that did duty as a rack and catching sight of
the canvas walked toward the easel holding the thirty by forty

Where did you get it Freddie he said putting his arms around the
shoulders of his old chum and dragging him toward the easel for a
closer inspection of the grain of the canvas

Snedecors

Just right old man Much obliged and he felt the grain of the cloth
with his thumb Got a ruff and he glanced about him Oh yes I
see Thanks

The men now that Oliver had arrived drew up around the long table
Some began setting their palettes others picked out from the common
stock before them the panels canvases china plates or sheets of
paper which under their deft touches were so soon to be covered with
dainty bits of color

It was in many ways a remarkable club Most of its members had already
achieved the highest rank in their several professions and outside the
walls of this eyrie were known as earnest thoughtful men envied and
sought after by those who respected their aims and successes

Inside these cosey rooms all restraint was laid aside and each mans
personality and temperament expressed itself without reserve Harry
Stedman who perhaps had been teaching a class of students all the
morning in the new building of the National Academy of Design each one
of whom hung upon his words as if he had been inspired could be found
here a few hours later joining in a chorus with a voice loud enough to
rattle every mug on the table

Waller who doubtless that same night had been the bright particular
star at some smart dinner uptown and whose red ribbon had added such
eclat to the occasion and whose low voice and quiet manners and
correct conventional speeches had so charmed and captivated the lady
on his right would when once in this room sit astride some chair a
pipe in one hand a mug of beer in the other Here he would discuss
with Simmons or Jack or Oliver his preference of Chopin over Beethoven
or the difference between ParepaRosa and Jenny Lind or any topic
which had risen out of the common talk and all too with a
grotesqueness of speech and manner that would have frozen his hostess
of the dinnertable dumb with astonishment could she have seen him

And so with the others Each man was frankly himself and in undress
uniform when under Freds skylight or when the club was enjoying any
one of its various festivals and functions

Olivers election into the organization had therefore been to him one
of the greatest honors he had received since his skill as a painter had
been recognized by his fellowsan honor not conferred upon him because
he had been one of the earlier members of the old Union Square
organization many of whom had been left out but entirely because he
was not only the best of fellows but among the best of painters as
well An honor too which brought with it the possibility of a certain
satisfying of his tastes Only once before had he found an atmosphere
so congenial and that was when the big hemlocks that he loved stood
firm and silent about himcompanions in a wilderness that rested him

The coming together of such a body of men representing as they did
the choicest the city afforded in art literature and music had been
as natural and unavoidable as the concentration of a mass of iron
filings toward a magnet That insatiable hunger of the Bohemian that
craving of the craftsman for men of his kind had at last overpowered
them and the meetings in Freds studio were the inevitable result

Many of these devotees of the arts had landed on the barren shores of
Americabarren of even the slightest trace of that life they had
learned to love so well in the Quartier Latin in Paris and in the
Rathskellers of Munich and Dusseldorfand had wandered about in the
uncongenial atmosphere of the commonplace until this retreat had been
opened to them Some like Fred Stone and Jack Bedford who had
struggled on through the war too much occupied in the whirl of their
life to miss at the time the associations of men of similar tastes had
eagerly grasped the opportunity when it came and others like Oliver
who had had all they could do to get their three meals during the day
and a shelter for the night had hardly been conscious of what they
wanted until the club had extended to them its congenial surroundings

On the trio of painters we knew best in the old days these privations
and the uncertainties and disappointments of the war had left their
indelible mark You became aware of this when you saw them among their
fellowworkers About Freds temples many telltale gray hairs were
mingled with the brown and about his mouth and eyes were deeper lines
than those which hard work alone would have cut He carried a hole
too in his right armor did until the army surgeon sewed it upyou
could see it as a blue scar every time he rolled up his sleevea
slight souvenir of the Battle of Five Forks It was bored out by a
bullet from the hands of a man in gray when Fred dropping his
sketchbook had bent to drag a wounded soldier from under an
overturned caisson He carried no scar however in his heart That
organ beat with as keen a sympathy and as warm a spirit of camaraderie
as it did when it first opened itself to Olivers miseries in Union
Square

Jack Bedford gaunt and strong of limb looking a foot taller had more
than once been compelled to lay down his painters palette and take up
the signpainters brush and the telltale wrinkles about his eyes and
the set look about his mouth testified but too plainly to the keenness
of his sufferings

And Oliver

Ah what of Oliver and of the changes in him since that fatal night in
Kennedy Square when he had been driven away from his home and made an
outcast because he had been brave enough to defend a helpless man

You can see at a glance as you watch him standing by the big easel
his coat off to give his arm freer play squeezing the tubes of color
on his palette that he is not the boy you knew some years ago He is
you will admit as strong and alertlooking as he was that morning when
he cleared the space in front of Margarets brother with a cartrung
You will concede too that the muscles about his chest and throat are
as firmly packed the eyes as keen and the smile as winning but you
will acknowledge that the boy in him ends there As you look the closer
you will note that the line of the jaw is more cleanly cut than in his
younger days that the ears are set closer to the finely modelled head
that the nose is more aquiline the eyes deeper and that the
overhanging brow is wrinkled with one or more tight knots that care has
tied and which only loosen when his face breaks into one of his
oldtime smiles The mustache is still therethe one which Sue once
laughed at but it has lost its silky curl and stands straight out now
from the corners of his mouth its points reaching almost to the line
of his ears There is too beneath it a small imperial giving to his
face the debonair look of a cavalier and which accentuates more than
any other one thing his Southern birth and training As you follow the
subtle outlines of his body you find too that he is better
proportioned than he was in his early manhood thinner around the
waist broader across the shoulders pressed into a closer mold more
compact more determinedlooking But for the gleam that now and then
flashes out of his laughing eyes and the winning smile that plays about
his mouth you would perhaps think that the years of hardship through
which he has passed have hardened his nature But you would be wrong
about the hardening process although you would have been entirely
right about the hardship

They had indeed been years of intense suffering full of privations
selfdenial and disappointments not only in his New York home but in
Kennedy Square whenever at long intervals he had gone back to the old
house to cheer its inmates in their lonelinessa loneliness relieved
only by the loyalty of old Malachi and Hannah and the affection and
sympathy of their immediate relatives and of such close friends as Amos
Cobb who had never left his post Miss Clendenning Dr Wallace
Nathan and some others But this sympathy had not always been extended
to Olivernot by his old schoolmates and chums at least Even Sue had
passed him in the street with a cold stare and not a few of the other
girlsgirls he had romped with many a night through the cool paths of
Kennedy Square had drawn their skirts aside as he passed lest he
should foul them with his touch

But his courage had not wavered nor had his strength failed him The
same qualities that had made Richard stick to the motor were in his own
blood His delicately modelled slender fingers white as ivory and as
sure as a pair of callipersso like his fathersand which as we
watch him work so deftly arranging the colors on his palette adjusting
the oilcup trying the points of the brushes on his thumbnail
gathering them in a sheaf in his left hand as they answer his purpose
had served him in more ways than one since he took that midnight ride
back from his old home in Kennedy Square These same hands that look so
white and wellkept as he stands by his easel in the full glare of the
gasjets had been his sole reliance during these days of toil and
suffering They had provided all the bread that had gone into his
mouth and every stitch of clothes that had covered his back And they
had not been overparticular as to how they had accomplished it nor at
what hours or places They had cleaned lithographic stones the
fingernails stained for weeks with colored inks they had packed
hardware they had driven a pen far into the night on space work for
the daily papers they had carried a dinnerpail to and from his
lodgings to the factory two miles away where he had workedvery little
in this pail some of the time they had posted ledgers made
officefires swept out storesanything and everything that his will
compelled and his necessities made imperative And they had done it
all forcefully and willingly with the persistence and sureness of
machines accomplishing a certain output in so many hours Joyfully too
sustained and encouraged by the woman he loved and whose heart through
all his and her vicissitudes was still his own

All this had strengthened him had taught him that any kind of work no
matter how menial was worthy of a gentleman so long as his object was
obtainedin this case his independence and his livelihood It had been
a bitter experience at first especially for a Southerner brought up as
he had been but he had mastered it at last His early training had
helped him especially that part which he owed to his mother who had
made him carry the marketbasket as a boy to humble a foolish and
hurtful pride He was proud enough of it now

But never through all these privations had these same white hands and
this tired body and brain been so occupied that they could not find
time during some one of the hours of the day and night to wield the
brush no matter how urgent had been the call for the weeks
boardwielding it too so lovingly and knowingly and with such
persistency that tonight although still poorhe stood recognized as
a rising man by the men in the front rank of the painters of his time

And with his mothers consent too Not that he had asked it in so many
words and stood hesitating fearing to take the divergent path until he
could take her willing blessing with him He had made his decision
firmly and against her wishes She had kept silent at first and had
watched his progress as she had watched his baby steps
tearfullyprayerfully at timesstanding ready to catch him if he
fell But that was over now The bigness of her vision covering margins
wide enough for new impressions impressions which her broad mind
great enough and honest enough to confess its mistakes always welcomed
and understood had long since made clear to her what in her early
anxiety she had ignoredthat if her son had inherited the creative
and imaginative gifts of his father those gifts which she so little
understood he had also inherited from her a certain spirit of
determination together with that practical turn of mind which had
given the men of her own family their eminence In proof of this she
could not but see that the instability which she had so dreaded in his
earlier years had given way to a certain fixedness of purpose and firm
selfreliance The thought of this thrilled her as nothing else in his
whole career had ever done All these things helped reconcile her to
his choice of a profession

Oliver now thoroughly warm and dry busied himself getting his brushes
and paints together and scraping off one of Freds palettes Bianchis
bald head and fat red smoothshaven face with its double chintime
had not dealt leniently with the distinguished lithographerhad
inspired our hero to attempt a Franz Hals smear as Waller called it
and the Pole when he arrived was to sit for him in the costume of an
old Dutch burgomaster the big white ruff furnishing the high lights in
the canvas

By the time Oliver had arranged his palette the club had settled itself
for work the smoke from the pipes floating in long lines toward the
ceiling befogging the big white albatross that hung from a wire in the
skylight Munson who had rubbed in a background of bitumen over a
square tile sat next to Fred who was picking out with the end of a
wooden match the outlines of an armywagon sketched on a plate smeared
with color Simmons was looking over a portfolio that Watson a new
member had brought with him filled with a lot of his summer sketches
made on the Normandy coast

One view of the fishmarket at Dieppe caught Olivers eye The slant of
light burnishing the roof of the church to silver and flooding the
pavement of the open square crowded with black figures the white caps
of the fishwomen indicated by crisp pats of the brush pleased our
painter immensely

Charming old man said Oliver turning to Watson How long did it
take you

About four hours

Looks like it growled Waller reaching over Olivers shoulder and
drawing the sketch toward him Thats the gospel of smear Horn
and he tossed it back Not a figure in the group has got any drawing
in it

Waller had set his face against the new outdoor school and never lost
a chance to ridicule it

Thats not what Watson is after exclaimed Oliver The figures are
mere accessories The dominating light is the thing hes got
thatand he held the sketch close to the overhead gasjets so that
the members could see it the better

Dominating light be hanged Whats the use of slobbering puddles of
paint over a canvas and calling it plein air or impressionism or
outofdoors or some such rot Get down to business and DRAW When you
have done that you can talk It cant be done in four hours and if
some of you fellows keep on the way youre going youll never do it in
four years

A four hours sketch handled as Watson has this said Oliver
thoughtfully is better than four years work on one of your Hudson
Rivery things The sun doesnt stand still long enough for a man to get
more than an expression of what he seesthat is if hes after truth
The angle of shadow changes too quickly and so do the reflected
lights

Whats the matter with the next day burst out Waller Cant you
take up your sketch where you left off You talk as if every great
picture had to be painted before luncheon

But there is no next day interrupted Watson I entirely agree
with Horn He had been listening to the discussion with silent
interest No next day like the one on which you began your canvas The
sky is differentgray blue or full of fleecy sunny clouds Your
shadows are more purple or blue or gray depending on your sky
overhead and so are your reflections If you go on and try to piece
out your sketch you make an almanac of itnot a portrait of what you
saw I can pick out the Mondays Tuesdays and Wednesdays on that kind
of a sketch as soon as I see it Nature is like a birdif you want to
surprise her you must let go both barrels when she rises if you miss
her at your first shot you will never have another chancenot at that
particular bird

Well but suppose you DO happen to have two days alike insisted
Waller I have seen thirty days on a stretch in Venice without a
cloud What then The bird simile had evidently not appealed to the
great critic

Then ten chances to one you are not the same man you were the day
before replied Watson calmly laying down his pipe You have had
bad news from home or your liver is out of order or worse still you
have seen some new subject which has taken hold of you and your first
enthusiasm has oozed away If you persist in going on you will either
undo what you did yesterday or you will trust to your memory of what
you THINK yesterday was to finish your sketch by The first fills it
full of lies and the second full of yourself neither have anything to
do with nature Four hours Waller not a minute more Youll come to
it before you die

That depends on what you have got to paint with snapped out Jack
Bedford who was trying to clean a dingylooking palette with a knife
Whose dirtdump is this anyhow and he held it up to view Might as
well try to get sunlight out of powdered brick Look at that pile of
mud and he pointed to some dry color near the thumbhole

Which palette came a voice

Jack held it up for the inspection of the room

Oh thats Parker Ridgways answered Fred He was here the other
day and made a halfhours sketch of a model I had

The announcement of Ridgways name was greeted with shouts of laughter
He was a society painter of the day pupil of Winterhalter and Meyer
von Bremen and had carried off more portraits and at higher prices
than all the other men put together

Keep on keep on Laugh away grumbled Waller squeezing a tube of
Prussian blue on his palette When any one of you fellows can get
4000 for a seasons work you can talk until you do you can keep
your mouths shut as tight as Long Island clams

Who got it

The Honorable Parker Ridgway RA PQ and I dont know but
XYZ roared Waller

Id like to know how asked Watson reaching over Freds arm for the
bottle of turpentine

Thats what he did snapped out Waller

Did what

Knew how

But he doesnt know how cried Munson from across the table I sat
alongside of that fellow at the Ecole for two years He cant draw and
never could His flesh was beastly his modelling worse and his
techniquea botch You can see what color he uses and he pointed to
the palette Jack was trying to clean

Granted my boy said Waller I didnt say he could PAINT I said he
knew how to earn 4000 in three months painting portraits

He never painted a portrait worth four cents Why I knew

Dry up Munson interrupted Jack Go on Waller tell us how he did
it

By using some horsesense and a little tact getting in with the
procession and bolding his cud up retorted Waller in a solemn tone

Give him room Give him room cried Oliver with a laugh pouring a
little dryer into his oilcup He loved to hear Waller talk He flings
his words about as if they were chunks of coal he would always say

The great man wheeled his chair around and faced the room Olivers
words had sounded like a challenge

Keep it uppound away he cried his face reddening Ive watched
Ridgway ever since he arrived here last spring and I will give you his
recipe for success He didnt fall overboard into a secondrate club as
soon as he got here and rub his brushes on his coatsleeve to look
artistic Not much He had his name put up at the Union got Croney to
cut his clothes and Leary to make his hats played croquet with the
girls he knew drove tandemhis brotherinlawsand dined out every
night in the week Every day or two he would haul out one of his
sixfoot canvases and give it a coat of bitumen Always did this when
some club swell was around who would tell about it

Did it with a sponge muttered Munson Old trick of his

Next thing he did continued Waller ignoring Munsons aside was to
refuse a thousanddollar commission offered by a vulgar realestate man
to paint a twohundredpound pinksilk sofacushion of a wife in a
tightfitting waist This spread like the measles It was the talk of
the club of dinnertables and piazzas and before sundown Ridgways
exclusiveness in taste and artistic instincts were established Then he
hunted up a pretty young married woman occupying the deadcentre of the
sanctified social circle went into spasms over her beautyso classic
such an exquisite outline grew confidential with the husband at the
club and begged permission to make just a sketch only the size of his
handwanted it for his head of Sappho Berlin Exhibition Next he
rented a suite of rooms crowded in a lot of borrowed tapestries
brass Venetian chests lamps and hangings gave a teaservants this
time in liveryexhibited his Sappho refused a big price for it from
the husband got orders instead for two halflengths 1500 each
finished them in two weeks declined more commissions on account of
extreme fatigue disappeared with the first frost and the best cottage
people booked three more fulllengths in New Yorktwo to be painted
in Paris and the other on his return in the spring was followed to the
steamer by a bevy of beauties halfsmothered in flowers and
disappeared in a halo of artistic glory just 4000 in

Fred broke out into a roar in which the whole room joined

And you call that art do you cried Munson laying down his palette
His face was flushed his eyes snapping with indignation

I do my babbling infant retorted Waller I call it the art of
making the most of your opportunities and putting your best foot
foremost Thats a thing you fellows never seem to understand You want
to shuffle around in carpetslippers live in a garret and wait until
some moneybags climbs up your crazy staircases to discover you
Ridgway puts his foot in a patentleather pump and silk stocking and
never steps on a carpet that isnt two inches thick Merchants
engineers manufacturers and even scientists when they have anything
to sell go where there is somebody to buy why shouldnt an artist

Just like a fakir peddling cheap jewelry said Stedman in a low
voice sending a cloud of smoke to the ceiling

Or a buncoman trading watches with a farmer remarked Jack Bedford
What do you say My Lord TomNoddyand he slapped Oliver on the
back The sobriquet was one of Jacks pet names for Oliverall the
Kennedy Square people were more or less aristocrats to Jack Bedford
the signpainterall except Oliver

I think Wallers about halfright Jack As far as Ridgways work
goes you know and I know that there isnt one man or woman out of a
hundred among his brotherinlaws friends who knows whether its good
or badthats the pity of it If its bad and they buy it thats
their fault for not knowing any better not Ridgways fault for doing
the best he knows how By silk stockings and pumps I suppose Waller
means that Ridgway dressed himself like a gentleman had his hair cut
and paid some attention to his fingernails Thats why they were glad
to see him The day has gone by when a painter must affect a bobtailed
velveteen jacket long hair and a slouch hat to help him paint just
as the day has gone by when an artist is not an honored guest in any
gentlemans house in town

Bravo TomNoddy shouted Jack and Fred in a breath Drink you dear
old pressed brick Put your nose into this and Fred held a mug of
beer to Olivers lips

Oliver laid down his sheaf of brushesburied his nose in the cool rim
of the stone mug the only beverage the club permitted and was about
to continue his talk when his eye rested on Bianchi who was standing
in the open door his hand upraised so as to bespeak silence

Hereyou beautiful baldheaded old burgomaster shouted Oliver
Get into your ruff right away Been waiting half an hour for you and

Bianchi put his fingers to his lips with a whispered hush knit his
brow and pointed significantly behind him Every eye turned and a
breathless silence fell upon the group followed by a scraping of
chairs on the floor as each man sprang to his feet

Bianchis surprise had arrived




CHAPTER XXI

THE WOMAN IN BLACK


In the doorway immediately behind Bianchi and looking over the little
mans head stood a woman of perhaps forty years of age in full evening
toilet About her head was wound a black lace scarf and hanging from
her beautiful shoulders halfconcealing a figure of marvellous
symmetry was a long black cloak open at the throat trimmed with fur
and lined with watermelon pink silk Tucked in her hair was a red
japonica She was courtesying to the room with all the poise and
graciousness of a prima donna saluting an audience

Oliver sprang for his coat and was about to cram his arms into the
sleeves when she cried

Oh please dont I wish I could wear a coat myself so that I could
take it off and paint Oh the smell of the lovely pipes Its
heavenly and its so like home Really and she looked about her
this is the only place I have seen in America that I can breathe in
Ive heard of you all winter and I so wanted to come I would not give
dear Bianchi any rest till he brought me Oh Im so glad to be here

Oliver and the others were still standing looking in amazement at the
newcorner One of the unwritten laws of the club was that no woman
should ever enter its doors a law that until this moment had never
been broken

While she was speaking Bianchi stepped back and took the tips of the
womans fingers within his own When she had finished he thrust out one
foot and with the bow of an impresario introducing a new songstress
said

Gentlemen of the Stone Mugs I have the honor of presenting you to the
Countess Kovalski

Again the woman courtesied sweeping the floor with her black velvet
skirt broke out into a laugh handed her cloak and scarf to Bianchi
who threw them over the shoulders of the lay figure and moved toward
the table Fred as host drawing out a chair for her

Ohwhat lovely beginnings she continued examining the sketches
with her lorgnette after the members had made their salutations Let
me make one I studied two years with Achenbach You did not know that
Bianchi did you There are so many things you do not know you lovely
man She was as much at home as if she had been there every evening of
her life

Still with the same joyous selfcontained air she settled herself in
Freds proffered chair picked up one of Jacks brushes reached over
his shoulder and with a pleaseholdstill thank you scooped up a
little yellow ochre from his palette and unloaded it on a corner of a
tile Then stripping off her bracelets she piled them in a heap
before her selected a Greek coin dangling from the end of one of them
propped it up on the table and began to paint the men all of whom
were too astonished to resume their work crowding about her watching
the play of her brush a brush so masterful in its technique that
before the picture was finished the room broke out in unrestrained
applause

During all this time she was talking in German to Crug or in French to
Waller only stopping to light a fresh cigarette which she took from a
jewelled case and laid beside her She could no doubt have as easily
lapsed into Russian Choctaw or Chinese had there been any such
strange people about

When the men had resumed their customary seats and the room had once
more settled to workit had only been a question of sex that had
destroyed the equilibrium a question no longer of value now that the
fair intruder could really PAINTOliver bent over her and said in his
most gallant manner

If the Countess Kovalski will be gracious enough to excuse Bianchi he
had never left her elbow I will try and make a burgomaster of him
Perhaps you will help me tie this around his neck and he held out the
white ruff He had put on his coat despite her protest

What dear Bianchi in a ruff Oh how perfectly charming Thats
really just what he looks like Ive always told him that Rembrandt
ought to have seen him Come you sweet man hold up your beautiful
Dutch face

As she spoke she caught the ruff from Olivers hand and stretched out
her bare arms toward Blanch

No Im not going to pose now protested the Pole pushing back her
hands You can get me any time Take the Countess Horn Shed make a
stunner

Yes Yes Please do she laughed springing from her seat and
clapping her hands with all the gayety and joyousness of a child over
some expected pleasure

Oliver hesitated for an instant as he looked down into her eyes
wondering whether his brush could do justice to their depth Then he
glanced at her supple figure and white skin in contrast to the black
velvet its edge softened by the fall of lace the dominant insistent
note of the red japonica in her blueblack hair the flesh tones
brilliant under the gasjets The color scheme was exactly what he had
been looking for all winterblack white and a touch of red

I have never been so honored Madame Nothing could give me greater
pleasure he answered with a dry smile May I escort your ladyship
to the platform And he held out his hand and conducted her to the
stand facing the big easel

Then there followed a scene such as many of the Stone Mugs had not
shared in since they left the Latin Quarter

The Countess stood erect on the raised platform with head up and
slightly turned the full glare of the gasjets falling upon her neck
and throat made all the more brilliant by reason of the dark green
walls of Freds studio which formed the background behind her One arm
was partly raised a lighted cigarette between her fingers the other
was lost in the folds of the velvet gown She posed as naturally and as
easily as if she had done nothing else all her life and with a certain
bravado and swing that enchanted everybody in the room

One talent demanded of the artist members of the club when they sought
admission and insisted upon by the Committee was the ability
possessed in a marked degree by Oliver of making a rapid telling
sketch from life and at night So expert had most of the members
become that many of their pictures made under the gaslight were as
correct in their colorvalues as those done in the daytime In this
Oliver was pastmaster Most of his own work had to be done under
artificial light during the long years of his struggle

The menthey were again on their feetcrowded closer forming a
circle about the easel They saw that the subject appealed to Oliver
and they knew how much better he could paint when his heart was in his
work His picture of Margaret Grant in the TamoShanter cap the best
portrait at the last exhibition had proved that

Oliver saw the interest shown in his work and put himself on his
mettle He felt that not only his own reputation but the honor of the
Stone Mugs was at stake He felt too a certain pride and confidence
in the sureness of his toucha touch that the woman he loved believed
inone she had really taught him herself He began by blocking in with
a bit of charcoal the salient points of the composition Fred stood on
his left hand holding a cigarbox filled with tubes of color ready to
unscrew their tops and pass them to Oliver as he needed them

As the dark background of greenish black under the vigorous strokes of
his brush began to relieve the flesh tones and the coloring of the
lips and the japonica in the hair took their places in the
colorscheme a murmur of applause ran through the room No such piece
of nightwork had ever been painted since the club had come together
and certainly not before

A Fortuny by thunder burst out Waller He had been the first man to
recognize Olivers talent in the old days and had always felt proud of
his foresight

For two hours Oliver stood before his canvas the Countess resting now
and then floating over to the piano as Simmons had done running her
fingers over its keys or breaking out into Polish Hungarian or
French songs at the pleasure of the room During these rests Oliver
turned the picture to the wall He did not wish her to see it until it
was finished He was trying some brush tricks that Madge loved some
that she had learned in Coutures atelier and whose full effect could
only be recognized in the finished work

When the last touches of Olivers brush had been laid on the canvas
and the modest signature O H as was the custom had been affixed to
its lower lefthand corner he made a low salaam to the model and
whirled the easel in front of her

The cry of delight that escaped her lips was not only an expression of
her pleasure but it convinced every man in the club that the
Countesss technical knowledge of what constituted a work of art
equalled her many other accomplishments She sat looking at it with
thoughtful grave face and her whole manner changed She was no longer
the woman who had so charmed the room She was the connoisseur the
expert the jury of last resort Oliver watched her with absorbing
interest as he sat wiping his forehead with his handkerchief

Monsieur Horn she said slowly as if weighing each word if you
come to my country they will cover you all over with medals I had no
idea anyone in this new land could paint as you do You are a master
Permit me Monsieur to make you my obeisance and she dipped back on
one foot and swept the floor with her skirts

Oliver laughed returned the bow with a mock flourish and began
rolling down his shirtcuffs a thrill quivering through himthat
thrill only felt by a painter when he is conscious that some work of
his brush has reached the highwater mark of his abilities For only
the artist in him had been at work What stirred him was not the
personality of the Countessnot her charm nor beauty but the harmony
of the colors playing about her figure the reflected lights in the
blueblack of her hair the soft tones of the velvet lost in the
shadows of the floor and melting into the walls behind her the high
lights on the bare shoulder and arms divided by the severe band of
black the subdued grays in the fall of lace uniting the flesh tones
and the bodice and more than all the ringing note of red sung by the
japonica tucked in her hair and which found its only echo in the red of
her lipsred as a slashed pomegranate with the white seedteeth
showing through The other side of her beautiful selfthe side that
lay hidden under her soft lashes and velvet touch the side that could
blaze and scorch and burn to cindersthat side Oliver had never once
seen nor thought of

This may have been because while his fingers worked on his thoughts
were somewhere else and that he saw another face as he mixed his
colors and not that of the siren before him Or it may have been that
as he looked into the eyes of the Countess he saw too deeply into the
whirlpool of passion and pain which made up the undercurrent in this
beautiful womans strange life

Not so the others Many of whom were the most seriousminded of men
where women were concerned Crugwho to quote Waller had drifted
into a state of mind bordering on lunacywas so completely taken off
his feet that he again led her ladyship by her fingertips to the
piano and with his hand on his heart and his eyes upraised begged
her to sing for him some of the songs of her native land and in the
tongue of her own people the Countess complying so graciously and
singing with such consummate taste and skill throwing her soul into
every line that the men soon broke out in rounds of applause crowding
about her with the eagerness of bees around a hiveall except Waller
and Oliver who sat apart quietly watching her out of the corners of
their eyes

The portrait was forgotten now so were the sketches and tiles and the
work of the evening So was everything else but the woman who dominated
the room She kept her seat on the pianostool the centre of the
group as a queen of the ballet sits on a painted throne flashing her
eyes from one to the other wheeling about to dash off an air from some
unknown operaunknown to those who listenedlaying her lighted
cigarette on the musicrack as she played and whirling back again to
tell some anecdote of the composer who wrote it or some incident
connected with its production in Vienna or Warsaw or St
Petersburgthe club echoing her every whim

It is not to be wondered at therefore that the staid and soberminded
Stone Mugs under these conditions completely lost their heads and
that when Oliver picked up an empty beermug the symbol of the club
used in all ceremonies and began filling it with the names of the
members which he had written on slips of paper preparatory to the
drawing of the lottery for the picture which he had just
finishedevery meetingnight a lottery was drawn the lucky winner
possessing the picture of the eveningCrug and Munson should have
simultaneously sprung to their feet and waving their hands over their
heads have proposed in one and the same breath that Our
distinguished visitor should have the privilege of adding her own name
to those in Olivers mugthe picture to be her own individual property
should her patronymic be the first to be drawn from its open mouth

Waller started to his feet to object and the words of protest were
half out of his mouth when Oliver stopped him A woman was always a
woman to Oliver no matter what her past or present station in life
might be It was her sex that kept him loyal when any discourtesy was
involved

Keep still old man he whispered Theyve gone crazy but we cant
help it Get on your feet and vote

When the sound of the ayes adopting Crug and Munsons motion had died
away Oliver inscribed her initials upon a small piece of paper
dropped it in the mug held it high above the ladys head and asked
her to reach up her dainty fingers and pick out the name of the lucky
possessor of The Woman in Black as the picture had now been
christened The white arm went up the jewelled fingers felt about
nervously among the little ballots and then the Countess held up a
twisted bit of paper

A burst of applause filled the room The scrap of paper bore the
initials of the Countess The Woman in Black was her property

But the most extraordinary part by far of the evenings performance was
still to come

When the hour of midnight had arrivedthe hour of dispersal a rule
rarely brokenthe Countess called to Bianchi and directed him to go
out into the hall and bring in her long black stockings and stout
shoes which she had taken off outside Freds door and which she had
left hanging on a nail

I can see her nowfor I too was leaning over the same table Oliver
beside me watching this most extraordinary woman of another world a
woman who had been the idol of almost every capital in Europe and whom
I knew although Oliver did not had been quietly conducted out of some
of them between dark and daylightI can see her now I say sitting on
the pianostool facing the group the long black silk stockings that
Bianchi had brought her in her hands I remember just the way in which
after loosening her dainty redheeled slippers she swept aside her
skirts unfastened her garters and with the same unconsciousness and
ease with which she would have slipped a pair of rubbers over a pair of
shoes drew the long black stockings over her fleshcolored ones
refastening the garters again talking all the time first to one and
then the other pausing only to accentuate some sentence with a wave of
her shoe or stocking or cigarette as the action suited the words

That the group about her was composed solely of men made not the
slightest difference She was only trying to save those precious
fleshcolored silk stockings that concealed her white skin from the
slush and snow of the streets As to turning her back to her hosts
during this little change of toiletthat was the last thing that
entered her head She would as soon have stepped into a closet to put
on her gloves

And then again why should she be ashamed of her ankles and her
wellturned instep and dainty toes as compact in their silk covering
as peas in a pod She might have been perhaps in some one of the
satinlined drawingrooms around Madison Square or Irving Place but
not here breathing the blue smoke of a dozen pipes and among her own
kindthe kind she had known and loved and charmed all her life

After all it was but a question of economy Broadway was a slough of
mud and slush and neither she nor Bianchi had the price of a carriage
to spare

Oliver watched her until the whole comedy was complete then picking
up his wet sketch and handing it with the greatest care to Bianchi who
was to conduct her ladyship to her lodgings he placed the long black
cloak with the furtrimming and watermeloncolored silk lining about
her beautiful bare shoulders and with the whole club following and
waving their hands goodnight our young gentleman bowed her out and
downstairs with all the deference and respect he would have shown the
highest lady in the land




CHAPTER XXII

MARGARET GRANTTOP FLOOR


One spring morning some time after the visit of the Countess to the
club and the painting of her portrait by Oliverthe incident had
become the talk of the studios before the week was outOliver sat in
his own rooms on the top floor drinking his coffeethe coffee he had
boiled himself The janitor had just slipped two letters through a slit
in the door Both lay on the floor within reach of his hand One was
from his mother bearing the postmark of his native city the other was
from a prominent picturedealer on Broadway with a gallery and big
window looking out on the street

Oliver broke the seal of his mothers letter and moved his chair so
that the light from the overhead skylight would fall on its pages

It read as follows

My Darling Boy Your father goes to you tomorrow Mr Cobb was here
last night with a letter from some gentleman of means with whom he has
been corresponding They want to see the motor so your father and
Nathan leave on the early train

This mans continued kindness is a constant surprise to me I have
always thought it was he who prevented the mortgage from being
foreclosed but I never knew until yesterday that he had written his
name under my own the second time the note was to be renewed and that
he has kept it there ever since I cannot speak of this to him nor
must you if you see him for poor old Mr Steiger told me in
confidence I am the more glad now that we have always paid the
interest on the note The next payment which you have just sent me
due on the first of the month is now in my bureaudrawer ready for the
bank but I will not have to use it now

Whether the mortgage can ever be paid off I do not know for the farm
is ruined I fear Mr Mowbrays cousin who drove over last week to
see what was left of the plantations in that section writes me that
there is nothing remaining of your grandfathers place but the bare
ground and the house All the fences have been burned and many of the
beautiful trees cut down for firewood The Government still occupies
the house and one of the outbuildings although most of the hospital
stores have been moved away The last halfyears rent which was held
back owing to some new ruling from Washington came I am thankful to
say two days ago in a check from the paymaster here owing to Mr
Cobbs intercession He never loses an opportunity to praise you for
what you did for that poor young soldier and Mr Steiger told me that
when those in authority heard from Mr Cobb which Mrs Horn it was
they ordered the rent paid at once He is always doing just such
kindnesses for us But for this rental I dont know how we would have
been able to live and take care of those dependent upon us We little
knew my son when we both strove so hard to save the farm that it
would really be our only support This rent however will soon cease
and I tremble for the future I can only pray my Heavenly Father that
something will come out of this visit to New York It is our only hope
now

Dont lose sight of your father for a moment my son He is not well
and gets easily fatigued and although he is greatly elated over his
promised success as we all areand he certainly deserves to beI
think you will see a great change in him these last few months I would
not have consented to his going had not Nathan gone with him Nathan
insists upon paying the expenses of the trip he says it is only fair
that he should as your father has given him an interest in the motor
I earnestly hope for some results for I shall have no peace until the
whole amount of the mortgage is paid back to the bank and you and Mr
Cobb are released from the burden so heavy on you my boy

There is no other news to tell you Sue Clayton brought her boy in
today He is a sweet little fellow and has Sues eyes She has named
him John Clayton after her father They have made another attempt to
find the Colonels body on the battlefield but without success I am
afraid it will never be recovered

Lavinia sends her love She has been much better lately Her army
hospital work has weighed upon her I think Three years was too long

I have the last newspaper notices of your academy picture pinned on my
cushion and I show them to everybody who comes in They always delight
me You have had a hard fight my son but you are winning now No one
rejoices more than I do in your success As you said in your last
letter the times have really changed They certainly have for me
Sorrow and suffering have made me see many things in a different light
these last few years

Malachi and Hannah are well but the old man seems quite feeble at
times

Your loving mother

Sallie T Horn

Dear lady with your soft white hair and deep brown eyes that have so
often looked into mine How dreary were those long days of hate and
misery How wise and helpful you were to every living soul who sought
your aid friend and foe alike Your great heart sheltered and
comforted them all

Oliver read the letter through and put his lips to the signature In
all his life he had never failed to kiss his mothers name at the
bottom of her letters The only difference was that now he kissed them
with an added reverence The fact of his having proved himself right
and her wrong in the choice of his profession made loyalty with him the
more tender

Dear dear mother he said to himself You have had so much trouble
lately and you have been so plucky through it all He stopped looked
dreamily across the room and added with a sigh But she has not said
one word about Madge not one single word She doesnt answer that part
of my letter she doesnt intend to

Then he opened the other communication which read

Dear Mr Horn Please call here in the morning I have some good news
for you

John Snedecor

Oliver turned the picturedealers letter over peered into the
envelope as if he expected to find some trace of the good news tucked
away in its corners lifted the tray holding his frugal breakfast and
laid it on the floor outside his door ready for the janitors morning
round Then picking up his hat he locked his door hung an out card
on the knob and strolling downstairs stepped into the fresh morning
air He knew the dealer well He had placed two of old Mr Crockers
pictures with himone of which had been sold

When he reached Snedecors gallery he found the big window surrounded
with a crowd gazing intently at an upright portrait in a glittering
gold frame to which was affixed an imposinglooking nameplate bearing
the inscription

 THE WOMAN IN BLACK
 BY OLIVER HORN

So this was Snedecors good news

Oliver made his way through the crowd and into the open door of the
shopthe shop was in front the gallery in the rearand found the
proprietor leaning over a case filled with artists supplies

Has she had it FRAMED Snedecor asked Oliver with a light laugh

Not to any alarming extent I made that frame for Mr Peter Fish She
sent it here for sale and Fish bought it Hes wild about it Says
its the best thing since Sully He wants you to paint his daughter
thats what I wanted to see you about Great card for you Mr Horn I
congratulate you

Oliver gave a low whistle His own good fortune was for the moment
forgotten in his surprise at the womans audacity Selling a sketch
painted by one of the club one which had virtually been GIVEN to her

Poor Bianchi He does pick up the queerest people I wonder if she was
out of stockings he said halfaloud

Oh you neednt worry about the Madame she wont suffer for clothes
as long as shes got that pair of eyes in her head You just ought to
have seen her handle old Fish It was beautiful But see here now you
dont want to make old Peter a present of this portrait of his
daughter Hes good for a thousand I tell you She got a cracking
price for that one and he pointed to the picture

Again Oliver laughed

A cracking price She must have needed the money bad The more he
thought of it the funnier it seemed

Snedecor looked surprised He was thinking of Fishs order and the
amount of his commission Most of Olivers remarks were unintelligible
to himespecially his reference to the stockings

What shall I say to him Snedecor asked at last

Oh nothing in particular Just send him to my studio Ill be in all
tomorrow morning

Well but dont you think youd better go and see him yourself now
Hes too big a bug to run after people That kind of thing dont come
every day you know you might lose it Why he lives right near you in
that swell house across the Square

Oh I know him very well said Oliver nodding his head No let him
come tomorrow to me it wont hurt him to walk up three flights of
stairs Im busy today Now I think of it theres one thing though
you CAN tell him and please be particular about itthere will be no
advance over my regular price I dont care to compete with her
ladyship

Without waiting to hear the dealers protest he stepped outside the
shop and joined the crowd about the window elbowing each other for a
better view of the portrait No one recognized him He was too obscure
for that They might after this he thought with an exultant throb and
a flush of pride crossed his face

As he walked down Broadway a sense of the humor of the whole situation
came over him Here for years he had been working day and night
running the gauntlet of successive juries and hanging committees with
his best things rejected or skied until his TamoShanter girl made a
hit worrying hoping against hope racking his brain as to how and
when and where he would find the path which would lead him to
commercial successa difficult task for one too proud to beg for
favors and too independent to seek anothers aidand here out of the
clear sky had come this audacious Bohemienne the pet of foyer and
studioa woman who presented the greatest number of contrasts to the
things he held most dear in womankindand with a single stroke had
cleared the way to success for him And this too not from any love of
him nor his work nor his future but simply to settle a boardbill or
pay for a bonnet

Again Oliver laughed this time so loudly that the man in front turned
and looked at him

A cracking price he kept repeating to himself a cracking price
eh and out of old Peter Fish Went fishing for minnows and hooked a
whale and another little fish for me I wonder what she baited her
hook with That womans a genius

Suddenly he caught sight of the sign of a Long Island florist set up in
an apothecarys window between the big green and red glass globes that
lined its sides

Turning on his heel he entered the door

Pick me out a dozen red japonicas he said to the boy behind the
counter

Oliver waited until each shortstemmed blossom was carefully selected
laid on its bed of raw cotton blanketed with the same covering and
packed in a paper box Then taking a card from his pocket he wrote
upon its back Most grateful thanks for my share of the catch
slipped it into an envelope addressed it to The fair Fisher The
Countess Kovalski and with a grim smile on his face kept on down
Broadway toward the dingy hotel the resort of all the Southerners of
the time to arrange for rooms for his father and Nathan Gill

Having with his card and his japonicas dismissed the Countess from
his mind and to a certain extent his obligations the full importance
of this new order of Peter Fishs began to take possession of him The
color rose in his cheeks and an oldtime spring and lightness came into
his steps He knew that such a commission and from such a man would
at once gain for him a recognition from art patrons and a standing
among the dealers Lasting success was now assured him in the line he
had chosen for his lifes work It only remained for him to do the best
that was in him Better than all it had come to him unasked and
without any compromising effort on his own part

He knew the connoisseurs collection It filled the large gallery
adjoining his extensive home on Washington Square and was not only the
best in the city containing as it did examples of Sir Thomas Lawrence
Sir Joshua Reynolds Chrome Sully and many of the modern French
schoolamong them two fine Courbets and a Rousseaubut it had lately
been enriched by one or more important American landscapes notably
Sanford Giffords Catskill Gorge and Churchs Tropicstwo canvases
which had attracted more than usual attention at the Spring Exhibition
of the Academy An order therefore for a family portrait from so
distinguished a patron not only gave weight and dignity to the work of
any painter he might select but it would unquestionably influence his
many friends and acquaintances to go and do likewise

As Oliver his eyes aglow his whole heart filled with joy stepped
quickly down the street the beauty of the day made him throw back his
shoulders and drink in long deep breaths as if he would fill his very
pores with its vitality These early spring days in New Yorkthe most
beautiful the world over not even in Italy can one find better
skiesalways affected him in this way There was a strengthgiving
quality in the ozone a brilliancy in the sunshine and a tempered
coolness in the air to be found nowhere else There was too a certain
picturesqueness in the skyline of the housesa skyline fringed with
jets of white steam from the escapepipes of numerous fires below
which appealed to his artistic sense These curling plumes that waved
so triumphantly in the sparkling morning light or stirred by the wind
flapped like milkwhite signal flags breaking at last into tatters and
shreds blurring the edges of chimney and cornice were a constant
source of delight to the young painter He would often stop to watch
their movements and as often determine to paint them at the first
opportunity They seemed to express to him something of the happy
freedom of one released from pentup toil a freedom longed for in his
own heart and which had rarely been his since those blessed days under
Moose Hillock when he and Margaret roamed the woods together

Still a third cause of rejoicingand this sent a flutter around his
heartwas the near prospect of meeting his dear old father whom he
had not seen for months not since his last visit home and whose long
years of struggle and waiting seemed now to be so nearly ended

With these last joyous thoughts filling his mind he stepped quickly
through the corridor of the hotel approached the desk and had just
given the names of his father and Nathan to the clerk when a man
behind the counter interrupted him with

Just arrived Got in this morning There they are by the window

Two quaintlooking old gentlemen were gazing out upon the rush of
Broadwaytwo old gentlemen so unusual that even the habitues of the
place those who sat tilted back all day chipping the arms of their
chairs with their penknives or sipping countless toddies and juleps
were still staring at them in undisguised astonishment Oneit was
Nathanwore a queer hat bushy white hair and long penwiper cloak
it was the same cloak or another just like it the same no doubt few
new clothes had been bought during the war And the otherand this was
his own dear fatherwore a buff waistcoat high white silk scarf and
brown frock coat with velvet collar Neither of them were everyday
sights around the corridors of the New York Hotel even among a
collection of human oddities representing every State in the South

We thought it best to take the night train my son said Richard
starting up at Olivers caressing touchhe had put both hands on his
fathers shoulders You got your dear mothers letter of course Oh
Im so glad to see you Sit down here alongside of us How well you are
looking my son and he patted him lovingly on the arm What a whirl
it all is Nathan and I have been here for hours we arrived at six
oclock Did you ever see anything like it The people never seem to
stop coming Ah this is the place for you my boy Everything is so
alive so full of purpose so intense so delightful and inspiring to
me And such a change in the years since I was here

He had brought the motor with him It lay at the moment in a square box
inside the officerailing Not the big one which he had just
perfectedthat one was at home under the window in the old shop in
the back yard in Kennedy Squarebut a smaller working model made of
pine wood with glasstumblers for jars and imitation magnets wrapped
round with thread instead of wirethe whole unintelligible to the
layman but perfectly clear to the scientist He had with him too
packed in a small carpetbag which lay within reach of his hand all
the patents which had been granted him as the work progressedbesides
a huge bundle of papers such as legal documents notices from the
scientific journals and other data connected with the great Horn
Galvanic Motor which was soon to revolutionize the motive power of the
world Tucked away in his inside pocket ready for instant use was
Amos Cobbs letter introducing the distinguished inventor Mr
Richard Horn of Kennedy Square etc etc to the group of
capitalists who were impatiently waiting his arrival and who were to
furnish the unlimited sums of money necessary in its
developmentunlimited sums being ready for any scheme no matter how
chimerical in the flush times through which the country was then
passing

I have succeeded at last my boy as I wrote you continued Richard
with glowing eyes Even that small motor at homethe one you
knowthat one has a lifting power of a hundred pounds All that is
necessary now is to increase the size of the batteries and the final
result is assured Let me show you thisand oblivious of the many
eyes fastened on him he drew toward him the black carpetbag and took
out a sheet of paper covered with red and blue lines You see where
the differences are And you see hereand he pointed out the details
with his thin white fingerwhat I have done since I explained to you
the new additions This drawing when carried out will result in a
motor with a lifting capacity of ten tons Ah Oliver I cannot tell
you what a great relief has come to me now that I know my lifes work
is crowned with success

Nathan was quite as happy Richard was his sungod When the light of
hope and success flashed in the inventors quiet thoughtful face
Nathan basked in its warmth and was radiant in its glow He needed all
the warmth he could get poor old man The cold chill of the days of
fear and pain and sorrow had wellnigh shrivelled him up he showed it
in every line of his body His shoulders were much more bent his
timid pipestem legs the more shaky the furrows about his face
deeper the thin nose more transparent All during the war he had
literally lived in Richard The cry of the extras and the dull tramp
of marching troops and the rumbling of cars laden with army supplies
had jarred on his sensitive ear as would discordant notes in a
quartette Days at a time he would hide himself away in Richards
workshop helping him with his bellows or gluepot or piling the coals
on the fire of his forge The war while it lasted paralyzed some men
to inactionNathan was one of them

At last Oliver at last Nathan whispered to Oliver when Richards
head was turned for a moment Nothing now but plain sailing Ah its
a great day for dear Richard I couldnt sleep last night on the train
for thinking of him

As Oliver looked down into Nathans eyes glistening with hope and
happiness he wondered whether after all these long years of waiting
his fathers genius was really to be rewarded Was it the same old
story of successone so often ending in defeat and gloom he thought
or had the problem really been solved He knew that the machine had
stood its initial test and had developed a certain lifting power his
fathers word assured him of that but would it continue to develop in
proportion to its size

He turned again toward Richard The dear face was alight with a new
certainty the eyes brilliant the smiles about the lips coming and
going like summer clouds across the sun Such enthusiasm was not to be
resisted A fresh hope rose in the sons heart Could this now almost
assured success of his fathers help him with Madge Would their long
waiting come any nearer to being ended Would the sum of money realized
be large enough to pay off the dreaded mortgage and there still be
enough for the dear home and its inmates

He knew how large this hopedfor sum must be and how closely his own
and his mothers honor were involved in its cancellation Her letter
had indeed stated the factsthis motor was now their only hope outside
the work of his own brush

Perhaps after all his lucky day had come The first gleam of light
had been this order of Peter Fishs to paint his daughter and now
here sitting beside him was his father with a letter in his pocket
addressed to Amos Cobb from one of the richest men in New York who
stood ready to pay a small fortune for the motor Then he thought of
his mother What a delight it would be when she could be freed from the
millstone that had hung around her neck for years

He must go and tell Margaret and take his father and Nathan with him
Yes his lucky day HAD come

Soon the two delighted and astonished old gentlemen under Olivers
guidance were making their way up Broadway ostensibly to see his
picture at Snedecors but really to call upon the distinguished
painter Margaret Grant whom everyone was talking about both in New
York and in Kennedy Square for one of her pictures graced Miss
Clendennings boudoir at that very moment Our young Romeo had waited
too many months for someone from Kennedy Square to see the woman he
loved and now that the arms of his father and Nathan were linked in
his own and their legs subject to his orders he did not intend to let
many precious minutes pass before he rang Margarets studio bell

When Snedecors window was reached Richard stopped short in amazement

Yours Oliver Marvellous Marvellous Richard exclaimed when the
three had wedged their way into the crowd to see the better A fine
strong picture and a most superb looking woman Why I had no idea
Really Reallyand his voice trembled He was deeply touched The
strength of the coloring the masterly drawing the admiring crowd
about the window greatly surprised him While he had been closeted
with his invention thinking only of its success and bending every
energy for its completion this boy of his had become a master

I didnt do my full duty to you my son he said with a tone of
sadness in his voice when they had resumed their walk up Broadway
You lost much time in finding your lifes work I should have insisted
years ago that you follow the trend of your genius Your dear mother
was not willing and I let it go but it was wrong From something she
said to me the other night I feel sure she sees her mistake now but I
never mention it to her and do you never let her know I told you Yes
You started too late in life my boy

No dear old daddy I started just in the nick of time and in the
right way

How could he have thought anything else on this lovely spring morning
with the brightest of skies overhead his first important order within
his grasp his dear old father and Nathan beside him and the loveliest
girl in the world or on the planets beyond waiting for him at the top
of her studio stairs

Its most kind of you to say so continued Richard dodging the
people as he talked but couldnt you have learned to work by
following your own tastes

No dad I was too confounded lazy and too fond of fun And then the
dear mother wanted me to go to work and that was always enough for me

Oh my son it does me good to hear you say soand a light shone on
the old gentlemans face Yes you ALWAYS considered your mother You
cant think how she has suffered during these terrible years But for
the good offices of Mr Cobb whose kindness I shall never forget I do
not see how she could have gone through them as she has Isnt it fine
my son to think it is all over She will never have to worry
againnevernever The motor will end all her troubles She did not
believe in it once but she does now

They continued on up Broadway Oliver in the middle Richards arm in
his he hurrying them both along steering them across the streets
avoiding the trucks and dragging them past the windows they wanted to
look into with promises of plenty of time for that tomorrow or next
week Only once did he allow them to catch their breath and that was
when they passed the big bronze statue overlooking Union Square and
then only long enough for the two to take in its outlines and from its
pedestal to fix their eyes on the little windows of Miss Teetums
boardinghouse where he had spent so many happy and unhappy days

Soon the two breathless old gentlemen and equally breathless young
guidethe first condition due to the state of the two old gentlemens
lungs and the second due entirely to the state of this particular young
gentlemans heartstood in a doorway just off Madison Square before a
small bellpull bearing above it a tiny sign reading Margaret Grant
Top Floor

Miss Grant has been at home only a few months Oliver burst out as he
rang the bell and climbed the stairs Since her fathers death she has
been in Paris with her mother her cousin Higbee Shaw the sculptor
and her brother John A shell injured the drum of Johns ear and while
she painted he was under the care of a French specialist He is still
there with his mother If you think I can paint just wait until you see
Miss Grants work Think dad she has taken two medals in Munich and
last year had honorable mention at the Salon You remember her brother
of course dont you Uncle Nat the one Malachi hid over fathers
shop

Uncle Nat nodded his head as he toiled up the steps He remembered
every hour of the hideous nightmare He had been the one other man
besides Richard and the Chief of Police to shake Olivers hand that
fatal night when he was exiled from Kennedy Square

Mrs Mulligan in white apron a French cap on her head and looking as
fresh and clean as a trained nurse opened the door Margaret had
looked her up the very day she landed and had placed her in charge of
her apartment as cook housekeeper and ladys maid with full control
of the front door and of her studio The old woman was not hard to
trace she had followed the schools of the academy from their old
quarters to the new marble building on Twentythird Street and was
again posing for the drapedlife class and occasionally lending a hand
to the new janitor Margarets life abroad had taught her the secret of
living alone a problem easily solved when there are Mrs Mulligans to
be had for the asking

Yes Mr Oliver shes insoide Oh its frinds ye hev wid ye and
she started back

Only my father and Mr Gill and he brushed past Mrs Mulligan
parted the heavy portieres that divided Madges working studio from the
narrow hall thrust in his head and called out in his cheeriest voice

Madge who do you think is outside Guess Father and Uncle Nat Just
arrived this morning

Before Margaret could turn her head the two stood before her Richard
with his hat in his hand his brown overcoat with the velvet collar
over his armhe had slipped it off outsideand Nathan close behind
still in the long penwiper cloak

And is it really the distinguished young lady of whom I have heard so
much exclaimed Richard with his most courtly bow taking the girls
outstretched hand in both of his I am so glad to see you my dear
both on your own account and on account of your brother whom we once
sheltered And how is he now and your dear mother

To all of which Margaret answered in low gentle tones her eyes never
leaving Richards her hand still fast in his until he had turned to
introduce Nathan so that he might pay his respects

Nathan in his timid halting way stepped from behind Richard and
taking her welcoming hand told her how much he had wanted to know her
since he had seen the picture she had painted then hanging in Miss
Lavinias home both because it was the work of a woman and because
tooand he looked straight into her eyes when he said it and meant
every wordshe was the sister of the poor fellow who had been so
shamefully treated in his own city And Margaret her voice breaking
answered that but for the aid of such kind friends as himself and
Oliver John might never have come back adding how grateful she and
her whole family had been for the kindness shown her brother

While they were talking Richard with a slight bow as if to ask her
permission began making the tour of the room his glasses held to his
eyes examining each thing about him with the air of a connoisseur
suddenly ushered into a new collection of curios

Tell me who this sketch is by he asked stopping before Margaret
and pointing to a small Lambinet glowing like an opal on the
dullgreen wall of the studio I so seldom see good pictures that a
gem like this is a delight By a Frenchman Ah Yes I see the subtlety
of coloring Marvellous people these Frenchmen And this little jewel
you have here This bit of mezzo in color With this I am more
familiar for we have a good many collections of old prints at home It
is I thinkyesI thought I could not be mistakenit is a Morland
and he examined it closely his nose almost touching the glass

The next instant he had crossed the room to the window looking out over
the city the smoke and steam of a thousand fires floating over its
wide expanse

Come here my son he called to Oliver Look over that stretch of
energy and brains Is it not inspiring And that band of silver moving
so quietly and resistlessly out to sea What a power for good it all
is and what a story it will tell before the century is out

Margaret was by his side as he spoke She had hardly taken her eyes
from him since he entered the roomnot even when she was listening to
Nathan All her oldtime prejudices and preconceived estimates of
Richard were slipping away Was this the man whom she used to think of
as a dreamer of dreams and a shiftless Southerner This charming old
gentleman with the air of an aristocrat and the keen discernment of an
expert She could hardly believe her eyes

As for Oliver his very heart was bursting with pride It had all
happened exactly as he had wanted ithis father and Margaret had liked
each other from the very first moment And then she had been so
beautiful too even in her long paintingapron and her hair twisted up
in a coil on her head And the little blush of surprise and sweetness
which had overspread her face when they entered and which his father
must have seen and the inimitable grace with which she slipped from
her high stool and with a half courtesy held out her hand to welcome
her visitors and all with the savoir faire and charm of a woman of the
world How it all went straight to his heart

If however he had ever thought her pretty in this workingcostume he
thought her all the more captivating a few minutes later in the little
French jacketall pockets and buttonswhich she had put on as soon as
the greetings were over and the tour of the room had been made in
answer to Richards delighted questions

But it was in serving the luncheon which Mrs Mulligan had brought in
that his sweetheart was most enchanting Her fullrounded figure moved
so gracefully when she bent across to hand someone a cup and the pose
of the head was so delicious and it was all so bewitching and so
precisely satisfied his artistic sense And he so loved to hear her
talk when she was the centre of a group like this as much really to
see the movement of her lips and the light in her eyes and the gracious
way in which she moved her head as to hear what she said

He was indeed so overflowing with happiness over it all and she was so
enchanting in his eyes as she sat there dispensing the comforts of the
silver tray that he must needs pop out of the room with some impromptu
excuse and disappear into the little den which held her desk that he
might dash off a note which he tucked under her writingpadone of
their hidingplacesand which bore the lines You were never so much
my queen as you are today dearest and which she found later and
covered with kisses before he was half way down the block on his way
back to the hotel with the two old gentlemen

She was indeed beautiful The brow was wider and whiter perhaps than
it had been in the old days under the bark slant and the look out of
the eyes a trifle softer and with a certain tenderness in themnot
quite so defiant and fearless but there had been no other changes
Certainly none in the goldbrown hair that Oliver so loved That was
still her glory and was still heaped up in magnificent masses and
with the same look about it of being ready to burst its bonds and flood
everything with a river of gold

Lots of good news today Madge Oliver exclaimed after they had all
taken their seats his father on Margarets right with Nathan next

Yes and I have got lots of good news too bushels of it laughed
Margaret

You tell me first cried Oliver bending toward her his face beaming
each day they exchanged the minutest occurrences of their lives

NoOllieLet me hear yours Whats it about Mines about a picture

Sos mine exclaimed Olive his eyes brimming with fun and the joy of
the surprise he had in store for her

But its about one of your OWN pictures Ollie

Sos mine he cried again his voice rising in merriment

Oh Ollie tell me first pleaded Margaret with a tone in her voice
of such coaxing sweetness that only Richards and Nathans presence
restrained him from catching her up in his arms and kissing her then
and there

No not until you have told me yours he answered with mock firmness
Mine came in a letter

So did mine cried Margaret clapping her hands I dont believe
yours is half as good as mine and Im not going to wait to hear it Now
listen and she opened an envelope that lay on the table within reach
of her hand This is from my brother John and she turned toward
Richard and Nathan He and Couture in whose atelier I studied are
great friends Now please pay attention Mr Autocrat and she looked
at Oliver over the edge of the letter and began to read

Couture came in today on his way home and I showed him the photograph
Ollie sent me of his portrait of youhis TamoShanter Girl he
calls it Couture was so enthusiastic about it that he wants it sent to
Paris at once so that he can exhibit it in his own studio to some of
the painters there Then he is going to send it to the Salon So you
can tell that Johnnie Reb to pass it along to me by the first
steamer and you can tell him too that his last letter is a month
old and I am getting hungry for another

There now what do you think of that Mr Honorable Mention

Oliver opened his eyes in astonishment

Thats just like John bless his heart he answered slowly as his
glance sought the floor This last drop had filled his cup of happiness
to the brim Some of it was glistening on his lashes

Now tell me your good news she continued her eyes still dancing
She had seen the look but misunderstood the cause

Oliver raised his eyes

Oh its not nearly as good as yours Madge in one way and yet in
another its a heap better What do you think Old Peter Fish wants me
to paint his daughters portrait

Margaret laid her hand on his

Oh Oliver Not Peter Fish Thats the best thing that has happened
yet and her face instantly assumed a more serious expression I know
the girlshe will be an easy subject shes exactly your type How do
you know

Just saw John Snedecor in answer to a letter he wrote me Fish has
bought the Woman in Black Hes delighted with it

Why I thought it belonged to the Countess

So it did She sold it

Sold it

Yes Does it surprise you

No I cant say that it does I am glad though that it will stay in
the country Its by far the best thing you or anybody else has done
this season I was afraid she would take it back with her Poor woman
she has had a hard life and it doesnt seem to get any better from
what I hear

You know the original then my dear asked Richard holding out his
second cup of tea for another lump of sugar which Margaret in her
excitement had forgotten He and Nathan had listened with the keenest
interest to the reading of John Grants letter and to the discussion
that had followed

I know OF her answered Margaret as she dropped it in and she knows
me but Ive never met her Shes a Pole and something of a painter
too She studied in the same atelier where I was but that was before I
went to Paris Her husband became mixed up in some political conspiracy
and was sent to Siberia and she was put across the frontier that same
night She is very popular in Paris they all like her especially the
painters There is nothing against her except her poverty There could
be nothing against any woman in Margarets eyes But for her jewels
she would have had as hard a time to get on as the rest of us Now and
then she parts with one of her pearls and between times she teaches
music You must see the picture Oliver painted of herit will delight
you

Oh but I have exclaimed Richard laying down his cup We looked at
it as we came up It is really a great picture He tells me it is the
work of two hours and under gaslight

No not altogether father I had a few hours on it the next day
interrupted Oliver

Strong isnt it continued Margaret without noticing Olivers
explanation It is really better in many ways than the girl in the
TamoShanter capthe one he painted of me That had some of Lelys
qualities about it especially in the flesh tones He always tells me
the inspiration to paint it came from an old picture belonging to his
uncle You know that of course and she laid a thin sandwich on
Nathans plate

You mean Tilghmans Lelythe one in his house in Kennedy Square Oh
said Richard lifting his fingers in appreciation I know every line
of it It is one of the best Lelys I ever saw and to me the gem of
Tilghmans collection

Yes so Ollie tells me continued Margaret Now this picture of the
Countess is to me very much more in Velasquezs method than in Lelys
Broader and stronger and with a surer touch I have always told Ollie
he was right to give up landscapes These two pictures show it There
is really Mr Horn no one on this side of the water who is doing
exactly what Oliver is She spoke as if she was discussing Page
Huntington or Elliott or any other painter of the day not as if it was
her lover Did you notice how the lace was brushed in and all that
work about the throatespecially the shadow tones

She treated Richard precisely as if he was one of the guild His
criticisms of her own workfor he had insisted on seeing her latest
picture and had even been more enthusiastic over it than he had been
over Oliversand his instant appreciation of the Lambinet convinced
her even before he had finished the tour of the room that the quaint
old gentleman was as much at home in her atmosphere as he was in that
of his shop at home discussing scientific problems with some savant

I did my dear It is quite as you say answered Richard with great
earnestness This Woman in Black as he calls it is painted not
only with sureness and with an intimate knowledge of the textures but
it seems to me he has the faculty of expressing with each stroke of his
brush as an engraver does with his burin the rounds and hollows of
his surfaces And to think too my dear he continued that most of
it was done at night The color tones you knowand his manner
changed and a more thoughtful expression came into his facethe
scientist was speaking noware most difficult to manage at night The
colors of the spectrum undergo some very curious changes under
artificial light especially from a gas consuming as much carbon as our
common carburetted hydrogen The greens owing to the absorption of the
yellow rays become the brighter and the orange and red tones from
the same reason the more intense while the paler violets and in
fact all the tertiaries of a bluish cast lose

He stopped as he caught a puzzled expression on her face Oh what a
dreadful person I am he exclaimed rising from his seat It is quite
inexcusable in me Please forgive me my dearI was really thinking
aloud Such ponderous learned words should be kept out of this
delightful abode of the Muses and then I assure you I really know so
little about it and you know so much And he laughed softly and made
a little bow as a further apology

No I dont know one thing about it nor does any other painter I
know she laughed blowing out the alcohol lamp not quite in the
same way And if I did I should want you to come every day and bring
Mr Gill with you to tell me about it Whereupon Nathan replying
that nothing would give him more pleasure he had been silent most of
the timesomehow no one expected him to talk much when Richard was
present struggled to his feet at an almost imperceptible sign from
the inventor who suddenly remembered that his capitalists were waiting
for him pulled his old cloak about his shoulders and with Richard
leading the way they all four moved out into the hall and stood in the
open doorway

When they reached the top stair outside the studio dear Richard
stopped took both of Margarets hands in his and said in his kindest
voice and in his gravest and most thoughtful manner as he looked down
into her face

My dear Miss Grant may I tell you that I have today found in you the
realization of one of my daydreams And will you forgive an old man
when he says how proud it makes him to know a woman who is brave enough
to live the life you do You are the forerunner of a great movement my
dearthe mother of a new guild It is a grand and noble thing for a
woman to sustain herself with work that she lovesand the dear old
gentleman lifting his hat with the air of a courtier betook himself
downstairs followed by Nathan bowing as he went

No wonder he rejoiced Most of the dreams of his younger days were
coining true And now this womanthe beginning of a new erathe
opening out of a new civilization And ahead of it a National Art that
the world would one day recognize

He tried to express his delight to Oliver and turned to find him but
Oliver was not beside him nor did he join his father for five minutes
at least That young gentlemanjust as Richard and Nathan had reached
the BOTTOM of the second flight of stairshad suddenly remembered
something of the utmost importance which he had left in the INNER room
and which he could not possibly find until Madge waiting by the
banister had gone back to help him look for it and not then until
Mrs Mulligan had left them both and shut the kitchendoor behind her
Yes it was quite five minutes or more before Oliver clattered
downstairs after his guests stopping but once to look up through the
banisters into Margarets eyesshe was leaning over for the
purposehis open hand held up toward her as a sign that it was always
at her command




CHAPTER XXIII

MR MUNSONS LOST FOIL


For a quiet orderly well behaved and most dignified street Tenth
Street at seven oclock one April night was disgracing itself in a way
that must have shocked its inhabitants Cabs driving like mad were
rattling over the cobbles making their way toward the old Studio
Building Policemen were shouting to the drivers to keep in line Small
boys were darting in and out peering into the cab windows and calling
out to their fellows Ki Jimmy see de Ingin wid de fedderduster on
his heador Look at de pill in de yaller shirt My eye aint he a
honeycooler

At the entrance of the building just inside the door where the crowd
was thickest stood two men in armor with visors downstood so still
that the boys and bystanders thought they had been borrowed from some
bricabrac shop until in an unguarded moment one plumed knight
rested his tired leg with a rattling noise that sounded like a
tinpeddler shifting his pack or the adjustment of a length of
stovepipe Behind the speechless sentinels leading into the narrow
corridor stretched a red carpet bordered by rows of palms and
evergreens and hung about with Chinese lanterns

At the end of this carpet opened a door that looked into a banquet hall
as rich in color and as sumptuous in its interior fittings as an
audiencechamber of the Doges at a time when Venice ruled the world
The walls were draped with Venetian silks and Spanish velvets against
which were placed Moorish plaques Dutch brass sconces holding clusters
of candles barbaric spears bits of armor pairs of fencing foils old
cabinets and low luxurious divans Thrust up into the skylight its
gaff festooned with trawlnets drooped a huge sloops sail its
graceful folds breaking the square lines of the ceiling and all about
suspended on long filigree chains swung old churchlamps of brass or
silver burning ruby tapers

In the centre of this glow of color stood a round table its top
covered with a white cloth and laid with covers for fifty guests On
this were placed in orderly confusion great masses of flowers heard
up in rare porcelain vases silver candelabra bearing lighted candles
old Antwerp brass holding bonbons and sweets Venetian flagons filled
with rare wines Chinese and Japanese curios doing service as
ashreceivers and matchsafes Delft platters for choice dishes
besides Flemish mugs Bavarian glasses George III silver and the
like

At the head of this sumptuous board was placed a chair of state
upholstered in red velvet studded with brass rosettes the corners of
its high back surmounted by two upright gilt ornaments This was to
hold the Master of the Feast the presiding officer who was to govern
the merry spirits during the hours of the revel In front of this royal
chair was a huge stone mug crowned with laurel This was guarded by two
ebony figures armed with drawn scimitars which stood at each side of
the throneseat From these guards of honor radiated two halfcircles
of lesser chairs one for each guestof all patterns and periods old
Spanish altarseats in velvet Dutch chairs in leather Italian chairs
in motherofpearl and ivoryall armless and quite low so low that
the costumed slaves who were to wait on the royal assembly could
serve the courses without having to reach over the backs of the guests

Moving about the room rearranging the curios on the cabinets adding a
bit of porcelain to the collection on the table shifting the lights
for better effect lounging on the wide divans or massed about the
doorway welcoming the new arrivals as they entered were Italian nobles
of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries costumed with every detail
correct even to the jewelled daggers that hung at their sides all
genuine and of the period cardinals in red hats and wonderful church
robes the candlegrease of the altar still clinging to their skirts
Spanish grandees in velvet and brocade Indian rajahs in baggy silk
trousers and embroidered waistcoats with Kohinoors flashing from their
turbansnot genuine this time but brilliant all the same
Shakespeares Dantes one of each besides courtiers nobles
gallants and gentry of various climes and periods

All this splendor of appointment all these shaded candles
hanginglamps Venetian glass antique furniture rich costumes
Japanese curios and assorted bricabrac were gathered together and
arranged thus sumptuously to add charm and lustre to a banquet given by
the Stone Mugs to those of their friends most distinguished in their
several professions of art literature and music

Indeed any banquet the Club gave was sure to be as unique as it was
artistic

Sometimes it would be held in the hold of an abandoned vessel left high
and dry on a lonely beach which under the deft touches of the artists
of the Club would be transformed in a night to the cabin of a
buccaneer filled with the loot of a treasure ship Sometimes a canal
boat which the week before had been loaded with lime or potatoes
would be scoured out with a firehose its deck roofed with awnings and
hung with lanterns its hatches lined with palms and in the hold below
a table spread of such surprising beauty and in an interior so
gorgeous in its appointments that each guest as he descended the
carpeted staircase leading from the deck above to the carpeted keelson
below would rub his eyes wondering whether he had not been asleep and
had suddenly awakened aboard Cleopatras barge

Again the club would hold a Roman feast in one of Solaris upstairs
roomsthe successor to Rileys of the old dayseach man speaking
ancient Latin with Tenth Street terminals the servants dressed in
tunics and sandals and the members in togas Or they would make a
descent at midnight on Fulton Market and have their tomcods scooped
from the fishboxes alive and broiled to their liking while they
waited or they would take possession of Browns or Farrishs for mugs
of ale and English chops But it was always one so different from any
other function of its class that it formed the topic of the studios for
weeks thereafter

Tonight it was the humor of the club to reproduce as closely as
possible with the limited means at their disposalfor none of the
Stone Mugs were rolling in wealth nor did these functions require
itsome one of the great banquets of former times not to be
historically or chronologically correct but to express the artistic
atmosphere of such an occasion

That there were certain unavoidable and easily detected shams under all
this glamour of color and form did not lessen the charm of the present
function

Everybody of course knew before the evening was over or could have
found out had he tried that the two knights in armor who guarded the
sidewalk entrance to this royal chamber and who had been the target
of the streetrats until they took their places at the inside door
were respectively Mr Patrick McGinnis who tended the furnace in the
basement of the Tenth Street Studio Building stripped for the occasion
down to his red flannels and Signore Luigi Bennelli his Italian
assistant

A closer inspection of the two ebony blackamoors with drawn scimitars
who guarded the royal chair at the head of the table would have
revealed the fact that they were not made of ebony at all but of
veritable flesh and bloodthe blackamoor on the right being none other
than Black Sam the bootblack who shined shoes on the corner of the
avenue and his bloodthirsty pal on the left the kinkyhaired porter
who served the grocer next door the only HONEST thing about either
of them to quote Waller being the artistic clothes that they stood in

Further investigation would have shown that every one of the wonderful
things that made glad and glorious the big square room on the ground
floor of the building from the brass sconces on the walls to the
hanging church lamps with everything that their lights fell upon had
been gathered up that same morning from the several homes and studios
of the members by old black Jerry the official carman of the Academy
and had been dumped in an indiscriminate heap on the floor of the
banquet hall where they had been disentangled and arranged by half a
dozen painters of the club that the table and table cloth had been
borrowed from Solaris that the very rare and fragrant old Chianti
the clubs private stock was from Solaris own cellars via Duncans
the grocer and that the dinner itself was cooked and served by that
distinguished boniface himself assisted by half a dozen of his own
waiters each one wearing an original Malay costume selected from
Stedmans collection and used by him in his great picture of the Sepoy
mutiny

Moreover there was not the slightest doubt that the Ingin who was
now bowing so gravely to the master of ceremonies was no other than
the distinguished Mr Thomas Brandon Waller himself NA Knight of
the Legion of Honor Pupil of Piloty etc etc that the highclass
mandarin in the sacred yellow robe and peacock feather who accompanied
him was Crug the cellist that the baldheaded gentleman with the
pointed beard who looked the exact presentment of the divine William
was Munson and that the gay young gallant in the Spanish costume was
none other than our Oliver The other nobles cavaliers and hidalgos
were the less known members of the club who in their desire to make
the occasion a success had fitted themselves to their costumes instead
of attempting to fit the costumes to themselves with the difference
that each man not only looked the character he assumed but assumed the
character he looked

But no one even the most knowing no student of costumes no reader of
faces no discerner of character no acute observer of manners and
timesin glancing over the motley company would have thought for one
instant that in all this atmosphere of real unrealism the two old
gentlemen who had just entered leaning on Olivers armone in a brown
coat with high velvet collar and fluffy silk scarf and the other in a
long penwiper cloak which at the moment was slipping from his
shoulderswere genuine specimens of the period of today without a
touch of makeup about them that their oldtime manners even to the
quaint bows they both gave the master of ceremonies as they entered
the royal chamber were their very own part of their daily equipment
and that nothing in the gorgeous banquet hall from the jewelled rapier
belted to Olivers side and which had once graced the collection of a
prince down to the priceless bit of satsuma set out on the table and
now stuffed full of cigarettes the bit could be traced back to the
Ming dynasty were any more veritable or genuine or any more
representative of the best their periods afforded than these two quaint
old gentlemen from Kennedy Square

Had there been any doubt in the minds of any such wiseacre either
regarding their authenticity or their quality he had only to listen to
Olivers presentation of his father and friend and to hear Richard say
in his most courteous manner and in his most winning voice

I have never been more honored sir It was more than kind of you to
wish me to come My only regret is that I am not your age or I would
certainly have appeared in a costume more befitting the occasion I
have never dreamed of so beautiful a place

Or to see him lift his hand in astonishment as he swept his eye over
the room his arm still resting on the velvet sleeve of Olivers
doublet and hear him add in a half whisper

Wonderful Wonderful Such harmony of color such an exquisite light
I am amazed at the splendor of it all What Aladdin among you my son
held the lamp that evoked all this beauty

Or still more convincing would it have been had he watched him moving
about the room shaking every mans hand in turn Oliver mentioning
their real names and their several qualifications and after ward the
characters they assumed and Richard commenting on each profession in a
way quite his own

A musician sir he would have heard him exclaim as he grasped
Simmonss hand over which hung a fall of antique lace I have loved
music all my days It is an additional bond between us sir And the
costume is quite in keeping with your art How delightful it would be
my dear sir if we could discard forever the sombre clothes of our day
and go back to the velvets and silks Of the past

Mr Stedman did you say my son and he turned to Oliver You have
certainly mentioned this gentlemans name to me before If I do not
mistake he is one of your very old friends There is no need of your
telling me that you are Lorenzo I can quite understand now why Jessica
lost her heart

Or to see him turn to Jack Bedford with You dont tell me so Mr
John Bedford did you say Oliver Ah but we should not be strangers
sir If I am right you are a fellowtownsman of ours and have already
distinguished yourself in your profession Your costume is especially
becoming to you sir What discernment you have shown Permit me to
say that with you the old adage must be reversedthis time the man
makes the clothes

The same adage could really have been applied to this old gentlemans
own dress had he but only known it He had not altered it in twenty
years even after it had become a matter of comment among his neighbors
in Kennedy Square

I always associate ones clothes with ones manners he would say
with a smile If they are good and suited to the occasion best not
change them Nathan was of the same mind The wide hat long evenly
parted hair and penwiper cloak could be traced to these same
oldfashioned ideas These idiosyncrasies excited no comment so far as
Nathan was concerned He was always looked upon as belonging to some
antediluvian period but with a progressive man like Richard the case
his neighbors thought might have been different

As Richard moved about the room saluting each one in turn the men in
and out of costumethe guests were in evening dresslooked at each
other and smiled at the old gentlemans quaint ways but the old
gentleman with the same ease of manner and speech continued on quite
around the table followed closely by Nathan who limited his
salutations to a timid shake of the fingers and the leaving of some
word of praise or quaint greeting which many of them remember even to
this day

These introductions overOliver had arrived on the minutethe
ceremony of seating the guests was at once begun This ceremony was one
of great dignity the two menatarms escorting the Master of the
Feast the Most High PanJam Frederico Stono NA to his Royal
Chair guarded by the immovable blackamoors the members and guests
standing until His Royal Highness had taken his seat and then dropping
into their own When everyone was in his place Richard found himself
to his delight on the right of Fred and next to Nathan and Oliveran
honor accorded to him because of his age and relationship to one of the
most popular members of the club and not because of his genius and
attainmentsthese latter attributes being as yet unknown quantities in
that atmosphere The two thus seated together under the especial care
of Olivera fact which relieved the master of ceremonies of any
further anxiety on their accountwere to a certain extent left to
themselves the table being too large for general conversation except
with ones neighbors

The seat in which he had been placed exactly suited Richards frame of
mind With an occasional word to Fred he sat quite still talking now
and then in low tones to Nathan his eyes taking in every detail of the
strange scene

While Nathan saw only the color and beauty of it all Richards keener
mind was analyzing the causes that had led up to such a gathering and
the skill and taste with which the banquet had been carried out He
felt assured that the men who could idle so luxuriously and whose
technical knowledge had perfected the artistic effects about him could
also work at their several professions with equal results He was glad
that Oliver had been found worthy enough to be admitted to such a
circle He loved too to hear his sons voice and watch the impression
his words made on the room As the evening wore on and he listened to
his banter or caught the point of the jests that Oliver parried and
heard his merry laugh he would slip his hand under the table and pat
his boys knee with loving taps of admiration prouder of him than
ever His own pleasures so absorbed him that he continued to sit almost
silent except for a word now and then to Nathan or a monosyllable to
Fred

The guests who were near enough to observe the visitors closely soon
began to look upon Richard and Nathan as a couple of quaint harmless
exceedingly wellbred old gentlemen rather provincial in appearance
and a little stilted in their manners who before the evening was
over would perhaps become tired of the gayety ask to be excused
and betake themselves to bed All of which would be an eminently proper
proceeding in view of their extreme age and general infirmities old
gentlemen of three score years and over appearing more or less decrepit
to athletes of twenty and five

Waller was the only man who really seemed to take either of them
seriously After a critical examination of Richards head in clear
relief under the soft light of the candles he leaned over to Stedman
and said in a half whisper nodding toward Richard

Stedman old man take that in for a minute Strong isnt it
Wouldnt you like to paint him as a blessed old Cardinal in a red gown
See how fine the nose is and the forehead Best head Ive seen
anywhere Something in that old fellow

The dinner went on The Malays in scarlet and yellow served the dishes
and poured the wine with noiseless regularity The men at arms at each
side of the door rested their legs The two blackamoors guarding the
High PanJams chair and who had been promised double pay if they kept
still during the entire evening had not so far winked an eyelid Now
and then a burst of laughter would start from one end of the table
leap from chair to chair and end in a deafening roar in which the
whole room joined Each man was at his best Fred with entire gravity
and with his sternest and most High PanJam expression told just
after the fish was served a story of a negro cook at a camp so true to
life and in so perfect a dialect that the righthand blackamoor doubled
himself up like a jackknife much to the astonishment of those on the
far side of the big round table who up to that moment had firmly
believed them to be studio properties with ebony heads screwed on
bodies of iron wire the whole stuffed with curled hair Bianchi Who
had come in late clothed in a Burgomasters costume and the identical
ruff that Oliver had expected to paint him in the night when the
Countess took his place was called to account for piecing out his
dress with a pair of breeches a century behind his coat and hat and
had his voice drowned in a roar of protests before he could explain

Batterson the big baritone of the club Batterson with the resonant
voice surpassed all his former efforts by singing when the cheese and
salads were served a Bedouin lovesong with such power and pathos and
to the accompaniment of a native instrument so skilfully handled that
the room rose to its feet waving napkins and the great Carvalho the
famous tenora guest of Crugs each member could invite one
guestwho was singing that week at the Academy of Music left his seat
and circling the table threw his arms about the singer in undisguised
admiration

When the cigars and liqueurs had been passed aroundthese last were
poured from bubbleblown decanters and drunk from the little cups
flecked with gold that Munson had found in an old shop in Ravennathe
chairs were wheeled about or pushed back and the members and guests
rose from the table and drifted to the divans lining the walls or
threw themselves into the easychairs that were being brought from the
corners by the waiters The piano with the assistance of the two now
crestfallen and disappointed blackamoors who Eurydice like had
listened and lost was pushed from its place against the wall Crugs
cello was stripped of its green baize bag and Simmonss violincase
opened and his Stradivarius placed beside it The big table bearing
the wreck of the feast more captivating even in its delightful
disorder than it had been in its orderly confusion was then with the
combined help of all the Malays moved gently back against the wall so
as to widen the space around the piano its debris left undisturbed by
special orders from the Royal Chair the rattling of dishes while their
fun was in progress being one of the things which the club would not
tolerate

While all this rearranging of the banquethall was going on Simmons
was busying himself putting a new bridge under the strings of his
violin tightening its bow and testing the condition of his instrument
by that seesaw harumscarum flourish so common to all virtuososno
function of the club was ever complete without musicthe men meanwhile
settled themselves comfortably in their seats some occupying their old
chairs others taking possession of the divans the gay costumes of the
members and the black coats and white shirtfronts of the guests in
high relief against the wrecked dinnertable presenting a picture as
rich in color as it was strong in contrast

What is so significant by the way or so picturesque as a
dinnertable wrecked by good cheer and hospitality The stranded
crumpled napkins the bunching together of half and wholly emptied
glasses each one marking a period of contentthe low candles with
half dried tears still streaming down their cheeks tears of laughter
of course the charming disorder of cups on plates and the piling up
of dishes one on the otherall such a protest against the formality of
the beginning and all so suggestive of the lavish kindness of the
host A wonderful objectlesson is a wrecked dinnertable if one cares
to study it

Silence now fell upon the room the slightest noise when Simmons played
being an unpardonable sin The waiters were ordered either to become
part of the wall decoration or to betake themselves to the outside
hall or the infernal regions a suggestion of Wallers when one of
them rattled some glasses he was carrying on a tray

Simmons tucked a handkerchief in the band of his collar balanced his
bow for an instant looked around the room and asked in a modest
obliging way

What shall it be fellows

Better give us Bach The aria on the G strings answered Waller

No Chopin cried Fred

No you woodenhead Bachs aria whispered Waller Dont you know
that is the best thing he does

Bach it is then answered Simmons tucking his instrument under his
chin

As the music filled the room Richard settled himself on one of the
large divans between Nathan and Oliver his head lying back on the
cushions his eyes half closed If the table with its circle of
thoughtful and merry faces had set his brain to work the tones of
Simmonss violin had now stirred his very soul Music was the one thing
in the world he could not resist

He had never heard the aria better played He had no idea that anyone
since Ole Bulls time could play it so well Really the surprises of
this wonderful city were becoming greater to him every hour Nathan
too had caught the infection as he sat with his body bent forward his
head on one side listening intently

When the last note of Simmonss violin had ceased vibrating Richard
sprang to his feet with all the buoyancy of a boy and grasped the
musician by the hand

My dear sir you really astound me Your tone is most exquisite and I
must also thank you for the rendering It is one quite new to me Ole
Bull played it you rememberexcuse me and he picked up Simmonss
violin where he had laid it on the piano tucked it under his chin and
there vibrated through the room half a dozen quivering notes so clear
and sweet that all eyes were instantly directed toward the quaint old
gentleman who still stood with uplifted bow the violin in his hand

Where the devil did he learn to play like that said one member to
another Why I thought he was an inventor

Keep your toes in your pumps gentlemen said Waller under his breath
to some men beside him as he sat hunched up in the depths of an old
Spanish armchair He had not taken his eyes from Richard while the
music went on Were not half through with this old fellow One thing
Ive found out any howthats where this beggar Horn got his voice

Simmons was not so astounded if he were he did not show it He had
recognized the touch of a musician in the very first note that came
from the strings just as the painters of the club had recognized the
artist in the first line of the Countesss brush

Yes youre right Mr Horn said Simmons as Richard returned him
the instrument Now I come to think of it I do remember having heard
Ole Bull phrase it in that way you have Stop a moment take my violin
again and play the air Theres another instrument here which I can
use I brought it for one of my orchestra but he has not turned up
yet and he opened a cabinet behind him and took out a violin and bow

Richard laughed as he again picked up Simmonss instrument from the
piano where he had laid it

What an extraordinary place this is he said as he adjusted the
maestros violin to his chin It fills me with wonder Everything you
want seems to be within reach of your hand You take a bare room and
transform it into a dream of beauty you touch a spring in a sixteenth
century cabinet and out comes a violin Marvellous Marvellous and
he sounded the strings with his bow And a wonderful instrument too
he continued as he tightened one of its strings his acute ear having
detected a slight inaccuracy of pitch

Im all ready Mr Simmons now if you please

If the club and its guests had forgotten the old gentleman an hour
before the old gentleman had now quite forgotten them

He played simply and easily Simmons joining in picking out the
accompaniment entirely unaware that anybody was listening as unaware
as he would have been had only the whitehaired mistress been present
and perhaps Malachi stepping noiselessly in and out When he ceased
and the audience had broken out into exclamations of delight he looked
about him as if surprised and then suddenly remembering the cause of
it all said in a low gentle voice and with a pleasant smile I
dont wonder youre delighted gentlemen It is to me the most divine
of all his creations There is only one Bach That his hand had held
the bow and that the merit of its expression lay with him never seemed
to have entered his head

When the applause had died out and Oliver with the others had crowded
around his father to congratulate him the young fellows eyes fell
upon Nathan who was still sitting on the long divan his head resting
against the wall his trembling legs crossed one over the other the
thin hands in his lapRichards skill was a neverending delight to
Nathan and he had not lost a note that his bow had called out The
fluteplayer had kept so quiet since the music had begun and had
become so much a part of the decorationslike one of the old chairs
with its arms held out or a whitefaced bust staring from out a dark
corner or some portrait that looked down from the tapestries and held
its peacethat almost everyone had forgotten his presence

The attitude of the old manalways a pathetic one brought back to
Olivers mind some memory from out his boyhood days Suddenly a
forgotten strain from Nathans flute floated through his brain some
strain that had vibrated through the old rooms in Kennedy Square
Springing to his feet and tiptoeing to the door he passed between the
two men in armorrather tired knights by this time but still on
dutyran down the carpeted hall between the lines of palms and up one
flight of stairs Then came a series of low knocks A few minutes later
he bounded in again his rapier in his hand to give his legs freer play

I rapped up Mitchell whos sick in his studio upstairs and got his
flute he whispered to Waller If you think my father can play you
should hear Uncle Nat Gill and he walked toward Nathan the flute
held out toward him

The old gentleman woke to consciousness at the sight of the instrument
and a slight flush overspread his face

Oh Oliver Really gentlemenIOf course I love the instrument
but here among you all and he looked up in a helpless way

No no Uncle Nat cried Oliver pressing the flute into Nathans
hand We wont take any excuse There is no one in my town
gentlemen and he faced the others who can play as he does Please
Uncle Natjust for me its so long since I heard you play and he
caught hold of Nathans arm to lift him to his feet

You are quite right my son cried Richard and I will play his
accompaniment

Olivers announcement and Richards endorsement caused a stir as great
as Richards own performance A certain curiosity took possession of
the room quite distinct from the spirit of merriment which had
characterized it before Many of the men now left their seats and began
crowding about the pianored cardinals cavaliers nobles and
blackcoated guests looking over each others shoulders Everybody was
getting more and more mystified

Really Fred whispered Waller who still sat quietly watching the
two visitorshe had not taken his eyes from them since Richard in his
enthusiasm sprang forward to grasp Simmonss hand this is the most
ridiculous thing I ever saw in my life First comes this fossil
thoroughbred who outplays Simmons and now comes this old nutcracker
with his white towhair sticking out in two straight mops who is going
to play the flute What in thunder is coming next Pretty soon one of
them will be pulling rabbits out of somebodys ears or rubbing gold
watches into canary birds

Nathan took the flute from Olivers outstretched hand bowed in a timid
way like a schoolboy about to speak a piece turned it over carefully
tried the silver keys to see that they responded easily to the pressure
of his fingers and raised it to his lips Richard picked up the violin
and whispered to Munson with whom he had been talkingthe one member
who could play the piano as well as he could paint or fencewho nodded
his head in assent

Then with Richard leading the fourone of the guests a cellist of
distinction took Max Ungers placebegan Maxs arrangement of the
overture to Fidelio the one Richard and Nathan had played so often
together in the old parlor in Kennedy Square with Miss Clendenning and
Unger an arrangement which had now become known to most musical
amateurs

There is not a man yet alive who has forgotten the tones of Nathans
flute as they soared that night through the clouds of tobaccosmoke
that filled the great banquethall Every shade and gradation of tone
was a delight Now soft as the cooing of doves now low as the music of
a brook rippling over the shallows and again swelling into song like a
chorus of birds rejoicing in the coming of spring

Not until the voice in the slender instrument had become silent and the
last note of Richards bow had ceased reverberatingnot in fact until
both men had laid down their instruments and had turned from the
pianodid the room seem to recover from the spell that had bound it
Even then there was no applause no clapping of hands nor stamping of
feet There followed from members and guests alike only a deep
pentup sigh and a long breath of relief as if from a strain
unbearable Simmons who had sat with his head buried in his hands
gave no other sign of his approval than by rising from his chair
taking Nathans thin hand in his own and grasping it tightly without a
word Stedman blurted out in a low voice to himself My God Who ever
heard anything like that and remained fixed to his seat As for
Richard and Nathan they resumed their places on the divan as men who
had read a message not their own to willing ears

Another and quite a different mood now took possession of the room
Somehow the mellow tones of Nathans flute had silenced the spirit of
the rollicking buffoonery which had pervaded the evening

The blackcoated guests with superlative praise of the good time they
had had and with renewed thanks for the privilege began to bid Fred
the Master of Ceremonies goodnight Soon only the costumed members
with Richard and Nathan were left So far from being tired out with
the nights diversion these two old gentlemen seemed to have just
wakened up

Those remaining drew their chairs together lighted fresh cigars and
sat down to talk over the events of the evening Richard related an
anecdote of Macready when playing the part of Hamlet Stedman told of
the graceful manner in which Booth a few months before in the same
part had handed the flageolet to the musicians and the way the words
fell from his lips You would play upon me  Oliver addressing his
words rather to his father than to the roomacting the scene as he
talked and in his tightfitting doublet looking not unlike the
tragedian himself cut in with a description of the great tragedians
first night at the Winter Garden after his seclusiona night when the
whole house rose to greet their favorite and cheered and roared and
pounded everything within reach of their hands and feet for twenty
minutes while Booth stood with trembling knees the tears rolling down
his cheeks Munson remarked with some feelinghe was an intimate
friend of the actorthat he remembered the night perfectly having sat
behind Oliver and that Booth was not only the most accomplished actor
but the best swordsman ever seen on the American or any other stage
Munson was an expert fencer himself as was evidenced by the scar on
his left cheek received when he was a student at Heidelberg and so
thought himself competent to judge

While Munson was speaking the great Waller had risen from his seat for
the first time gathered his gorgeous raiment closer about him crossed
the room and now stood filling a thin glass from a Venetian flagon
that graced the demoralized table

Booths a swordsman is he he said pushing back his turban from his
forehead and walking toward Munson glass in hand his baggy trousers
and tunic making him look twice his regular size You know as much
about fencing Munson as you do about the lost tribes of Israel Booth
handles his foil as a policeman does a rattan cane in the pit of the
Bowery Forrest is the only man in this country who can handle a blade

I do do I cried Munson springing to his feet and unhooking a pair
of foils decorating the wall Stop where you are you caricature of
Nana Sahib or Ill run you through the body and pin you to the wall
like a beetle where you can kick to your hearts content Here catch
this and he tossed one of the foils to Waller

A ring A ring cried the men with one of those sudden inspirations
that often swept over them jumping from their seats and pushing back
the chairs and musicracks to give the contestants room

Waller laid down his wineglass slipped off his turban and gold
embroidered tunic with great deliberation threw them over to Oliver
who caught them in his arms tightened his sash grasped the foil in
his fat hand and with great gravity made a savage lunge at the
counterfeit presentment of William Shakespeare who parried his blow
without moving from where he stood Thereupon the lithe wellbuilt
young fellow teetered his foil in the air and with great nicety pinked
his fat antagonist in the stomach selecting a gilt band just above his
sash as the point of contact

A mock battle now ensued Munson chasing Waller about the room the
members roaring with laughter Richard with Olivers assistance
having mounted the divan to see the better clapping his hands like any
boy and shouting Bravo Bravo Now the uppercut now the thrust Ah
well done Capital Capital

Oliver listened in wonder to the strange expressions that dropped from
his fathers lips Up to that moment he had never known that the old
gentleman had ever touched a foil in his life

The next instant Richard was on the floor again commiserating with
Waller who was out of Munsons reach and out of breath with laughter
and congratulating Munson on his skill as a swordsman

I only noticed one flaw my dear Mr Munson in your handling he
cried with a graceful wave of the hand and that may be due to your
more modern way of fencing Pardon meand he picked up Wallers foil
where he had dropped it and the fine wrist with the nimble fingers
that had served him so well all his days closed over the handle of the
foil The thrust in the old days was made SO You I think made it
SOand two flashes at different angles gleamed in the candlelight

Munson as if to humor the old gentleman threw up his foil made a
pass or two and to his intense astonishment received the button of
Richards foil on his black velvet jacket and within an inch of his
heart

Everybody on the floor at once circled about the contestants The
spectacle of an old gentleman in a snuffcolored coat and high collar
having a bout with a short gentleman in shorter velvet trunks silk
hose and steel buckles was one too droll and too exhilarating to
loseanachronistic it was yet quite in keeping with the surroundings
More exhilarating still was the extreme punctiliousness with which the
old gentleman raised the handle of his foil to his chin after he had
made his point and saluted his antagonist as if he had been some
knight of King Arthurs table

Still more fascinating was the way in which the younger man settled
down to work his brow knit his lips tightly closed the members
widening out to give them room Oliver and Nathan cheering the loudest
of them all as Richards foil flashed in the air parrying receiving
now up now down his right foot edging closer his dear old head bent
low his deep eyes fixed on his young antagonist until with a quick
thrust of his arm and a sudden upward twist of his hand he wrenched
Munsons foil from his grasp and sent it flying across the room

Best of all was the joyful yet apologetic way with which Richard sprang
forward and held out his hand to Munson crying out

A fluke my dear Mr Munson quite a fluke I assure you Pray forgive
me A mere lucky accident My old fencing master Martini taught me
that trick I thought I had quite forgotten it Just think it is forty
years since I have had a foil in my hands and laughing like a boy he
crossed the room picked up the foil and bowing low handed it to the
crestfallen man with the air of a gallant


Half the club costumed as they wereit was now after midnight and
there were but few people in the streetsescorted the two old men back
to their hotel Munson walked beside Richard Waller his flowing
skirts tucked up inside his overcoat stepped on the right of Nathan
Oliver Fred and the others followed behind the hubbub of their talk
filling the night even when they reached the side door of the hotel
and rang up the night porter they must still stand on the sidewalk
listening to Richards account of the way the young gallants were
brought up in his day of the bouts with the foils and of the duels
which were fought before they were willing to take their leave

When the last goodbyes had been given and Oliver had waved his rapier
from the doorstep as a final farewell to his fellowmembers before he
saw his father upstairs to bed and the delighted escort had turned on
their heels to retrace their steps up Broadway Waller slipped his arm
into Munsons and said in his most thoughtful tone one entirely free
from cynicism or badinage

What a lovely pair of old duffers We talk about Bohemia Munson and
think weve got it but we havent Our kind is a cheap veneer glued to
commonplace pine Their kind is old mahogany solid all the way
throughfine grain high polish and no knots I only wish they lived
here




CHAPTER XXIV

IN THE TWILIGHT


Each day Margarets heart warmed more and more to Richard He not only
called out in her a tenderness and veneration for his age and
attainments which her own father had never permitted her to express
but his personality realized for her an ideal which until she knew
him she had despaired of ever finding While his courtesy his
oldtime manners his quaintness of speech and dress captivated her
imagination his perfect and unfailing sympathy and constant kindness
completely won her heart There was too now and then a peculiar tone
in his voice which would bring the tears to her eyes without her
knowing why until her mind would recall some blunt outspoken speech
of her dead fathers in answer to the very sentiments she was then
expressing to Richard who received them as a matter of coursea
remembrance which always caused a tightening about her heart

Sometimes the inventor would sit for her while she sketched his head in
different lights he watching her work interested in every stroke
every bit of composition She loved to have him beside her easel
criticising her work No one she told Oliver had ever been so
interested before with the little niceties of her techniquein the
amount of oil used in the way the paints were mixed in the value of a
palette knife as a brush or of an old cotton rag as a blender nor had
any one of her sitters ever been so enthusiastic over her results

There was one halfhour sketch which more than all the others
astonished and delighted himone in which Margaret in her finishing
touches had eschewed brushes paletteknife and rag and with one dash
of her dainty thumb had brought into instant relief the subtle curves
about his finely modelled nose This filled him with wonder and
admiration His own finger had always obeyed him and he loved to find
the same skill in another

To Richard these hours of intercourse with Margaret were among the
happiest of his life It was Margaret indeed who really helped him
bear with patience the tedious delays attendant upon the completion of
his financial operations Even when the final sum was agreed uponand
it was a generous one that filled Olivers heart with joy and set
Nathans imagination on firethe best part of two weeks had been
consumed before the firm of lawyers who were to pass upon Richards
patents were willing to certify to the purchasers of the stock of the
horn Magnetic Motor Company as to the priority of Richards invention
based on the patent granted on August 13 1856 and which covered the
principle of the levers working in connection with the magnets

During these tedious delays in which his heart had vibrated between
hope and fear he had found his way every afternoon to Margarets
studio Nathan having gone home to Kennedy Square with his head in the
clouds when the negotiations became a certainty In these weeks of
waiting the Northern girl had not only stolen his heart taking the
place of a daughter he had never knowna void never filled in any
mans soulbut she had satisfied a craving no less intense the hunger
for the companionship of one who really understood his aims and
purposes Nathan had in a measure met this need as far as unselfish
love and unswerving loyalty could go and so had his dear wife
especially in these later years when her mind had begun to grasp the
meaning of the social and financial changes that the war had brought
and what place her husbands inventions might hold in the new regime
But no one of these not even Nathan had ever understood him as
clearly as had this young girl

When it grew too dark to paint he would make her sit on a stool at his
feet while he would talk to her of his life work and of the future as
he saw itoften of things which he had kept shut away in his heart
even from Nathan He would tell her of the long years of anxiety of
the sleepless nights of his utter loneliness without a friend to
guide him while he was trying to solve the problems that had blocked
his path of the poverty of these late years all the more pitiful
because of his inability at times to buy even the bare materials and
instruments needed for his work and again of his many
disappointments in his search for the hopedfor link that was needed to
make his motor a success

Once in lowered tones and with that eager restless expression which
so often came into his face when standing over his workbench in his
little shop baffled by some unsolved problem he told her of his many
anxieties lest some other brain groping along the same paths should
reach the goal before him how the Scientific Review the one chronicle
of the discoveries of the time would often lie on his table for hours
before he had the courage to open it and read the list of patents
granted during the preceding months adding with a voice full of
gentleness I was ashamed of it all afterward my dear but Mrs Horn
became so anxious over our daily expenses and so much depended on my
success

This brave pioneer did not realize nor did she that they were both
valiant soldiers fighting the good fight of science and art against
tradition and provincialismpart of that great army of progress which
was steadily conquering the world

As she listened in the darkening shadows her hand in his her fingers
tight about his own he reading the sympathy of her touch and fearing
to have distressed her by his talk had started up and in his cheery
buoyant voice cried out

But it is all over now my child All past and gone The work of my
life is finished Theres plenty now for all of us For my dear wife
who has borne up so bravely and has never complained and for you and
Oliver Your waiting need not be long my dear This last happiness
which has come to meand he smoothed her hair gently with his thin
hand and drew her closer to himseems the greatest of them all


The two were seated in this way one afternoon Margaret resting after a
days work when Oliver opened the door She had made a sketch of
Richards head that very morning as he lay back in a big chair a
strong vigorous piece of work which she afterward finished

Richard looked up and his face broke into a joyous smile

Bring a chair my son he cried and sit by me I have something to
say to you When a few moments later Margaret had left the room to
give some directions to Mrs Mulligan he added I have been telling
Margaret that you both do wrong in putting off your marriage These
delays fret young peoples lives away She tells me it is your wish
What are you waiting for

Only for money enough to take care of her father Madge has been
accustomed to more comforts than I can give her She would I know
cheerfully give up half of her income small as it is to me if I would
let her but that is not the way I want to make her happy Dont worry
dear old dad the Fish portrait will pull us outand he leaned down
and put his arms about his fathers neck as he used to do when he was a
boy I shall get there before long

Oliver did not tell his father what a grief it had been to him to keep
Madge waiting nor how he had tried to make it up to her in every way
while he had made his fight alone Nor did he tell Richard of the
principal cause of his waitingthat the mortgage to which his mother
had pledged her name and to which he had morally pledged his own was
still unpaid

Richard listened to Olivers outburst without interrupting him

I only wanted to do the best I could for you my son he answered
laying his fingers on Olivers hand I was thinking of nothing but
your happiness During the last few days since I have become assured
that this negotiation would go through I have decided to carry out a
plan which has long been in my mind and which now that I know about
Margaret makes it all the more necessary I am going to make provision
for you immediately This I hope will be tomorrow or the next day at
farthest The contracts are all ready for our signatures and only
await the return of one of the attorneys who is out of town The cash
sum they pay for the control of the patents is as you know a
considerable one then I get nearly half of the capital stock of the
new company I am going to give you at once onethird of the money
and onethird of the stock

Oliver raised his hand in protest but Richard kept on

It is but just my son There are but three of usyour mother
yourself and I It is only your share I wont have you and Margaret
waiting until I am goneand he looked up with a smile on his face

Oliver stood for a moment dazed at the joyous news his fathers hand
in his the tears dimming his eyes While he was thanking him telling
him how glad he was that the struggle was over and how proud he was of
his genius Margaret stole up behind him and put her hands over his
eyes bidding him guess who it wasas if there could be another woman
in the whole world who would take the liberty Oliver caught her in his
arms and kissed her whispering in her ears the joyous news with her
cheek close to his and Margaret looked from one to the other and then
put her arms around Richard and kissed him without a wordthe first
time she had ever dared so much

Oh but there were joyous times that followed

Mrs Mulligan at a whispered word from her mistress ran downstairs
as fast as her old legs could carry her and came back with her arms
full of bundles which she dumped upon her small kitchentable And
Margaret put on a clean white apron white as snow and rolled up her
sleeves showing her beautiful arms above her elbowsOliver always
vowed that she had picked them up where the Milo had dropped themand
began emptying the contents of a bowl of oysters one of Mrs
Mulligans packages into a chafingdish And Oliver wheeled out the
table and brought out the cloth and dear old Richard his face full of
smiles placed the napkins with great precision beside each plate
puckering them up into little sheaves just as Malachi would have
done he said and then Margaret whispered to Oliver if he didnt
think it would be just the very thing they were so anxious to see
himand Oliver thought it wouldhe was cutting bread at the moment
and getting it ready for Mrs Mulligan to toast on her crackerbox of a
range and Margaret with her arms and her cheeks scarlet ran out in
the hall and down the corridor and came back out of breath with two
other girlsone in a calico frock belted in at her slender waist and
the other in a black bombazine and a linen collar And Richard looked
into their faces and took them both by the hand and told them how glad
he was to be permitted to share in their merrymakings and then when
Oliver had drawn out the chairsone was a stool by the waythe whole
party sat down Oliver at the foot and Richard on Margarets right the
old gentleman remarking as he opened his napkin that but one thing
was wanting to complete his happiness and that was Olivers mother
who of all women in the world would enjoy the occasion the most

But the happiest time of all was over the soup or rather over the
tureen or rather what was inside of itor worse still what was not
This wonderful soup had been ordered at the restaurant across the way
and was to be brought in smoking hot at the appointed time by a boy
The boy arrived on the minute and so did the tureena gayly flowered
affair with a cover the whole safely ensconced in a basket When the
lid was lifted and Margaret and the two girls looked in a merry shout
went up Not a drop of soup was in the tureen The boy craned his head
in amazement and Mrs Mulligan who stood by with the plates and who
had broken out into violent gestures at the sight was about to upbraid
the boy for his stupidity when Margarets quick eye discovered a trail
of grease running down the tablecloth along the floor and out of the
door Whereupon everybody got up including Richard and with roars of
laughter followed the devious trail out into the hall and so on down
the staircase as far as they could see Only when Mrs Mulligan on
their return to the room held up the tureen and pointed to a leak in
its bottom was the mystery explained

And so the merry dinner went on

Ah dear old man if these happy days could only have gone on till the
end

On the afternoon of the day following this joyous nightthe day the
contracts were to be signed a culmination which would make everybody
happyMargaret hurried up the stairs of her building and pushed open
the door She knew she should find the inventor waiting for her and
she wanted to be the first to get the glad news from his lips It was
varnishing day at the Academy and she had gone down to put the last
touches on her big portraitthe one of Madame X that she had begun
in Paris the year before

Richard did not move when she entered He was leaning back in the chair
she had placed for him his head on his hand his attitude one of
thoughtful repose the light of the fastfading twilight making a
silhouette of his figure She thought he was dozing and so crept up
behind him to make sure

Ah my dear is that you he asked The voice did not sound like
Richards

YesI thought you were asleep

No my childIm only greatly troubled Im glad you have comeand
he took her hand and smoothed it with his own Bring your stool I
have something to say to you

Without taking off her bonnet and cloak she took her place at his
feet The tones of his voice chilled her A great fear rose in her
heart Why she could not tell

Has anything happened to Oliver she asked eagerly

No nothing so terrible as that It is about the motor The bankers
have refused the loan and the attorneys have withdrawn the papers

Withdrawn the papers Oh no it cant be She had leaned forward now
her anxious startled eyes looking into his

Yes my dear a Mr Gorton from Maine has perfected a machine which
not only accomplishes what I claim for my own but is much better in
every way The attorneys have been looking into this new motor for a
week past so I learn now Here is their letterand he put his hand
in his pocket and took out a white envelope They will perhaps take
up Mr Gortons machine instead of mine I made a hasty examination of
this new motor this morning with my old friend Professor Morse and we
both agree that the invention is all Mr Gorton claims for it It is
only a beginning of course along the lines of galvanic energy but it
is a better beginning than mine and I feel sure it is all the inventor
claims for it I have so informed them and I have also written a
letter to Mr Gorton congratulating him on his success The calmness
and gentleness of his voice thrilled her

I suppose I ought to have telegraphed the news to Mrs Horn as I
promised he continued slowly as if each word gave him pain but I
really had not the heart so I came up here Ive been here all the
afternoon hoping you would come in The room felt a little cold my
dear and your good woman made a fire for me as you see You dont
mind do you

Margaret bowed her head on his hands and kissed the thin fingers that
lay in her own Her heart was full to bursting The pathos of the bent
figure the despairing sound of his voiceso unlike his buoyant tones
the ghostly light that permeated the room so restful always before so
grewsome and forbidding now appealed to her in a way she had never
known She was not thinking of herself nor of Oliver nor of the wife
waiting for the news at home she was only thinking of this dear old
man who sat with bowed head his courage gone all the joyousness out
of his life What hurt her most was her own utter helplessness In most
things she could be of service now she was powerless She knew it when
she spoke

Is it ended she asked at last her practical mind wanting to know
the worst

Yes my child ended I wish I could give you some hope but there is
none I shall go home tomorrow and begin againon what I do not
knowsomethingI cannot tell

Olivers footsteps sounded in the outer hall She rose quickly and met
him on the outside half closing the door so that she could tell him
the dreadful news without being overheard

Broken their promises to father Impossible Why What for Another
invention Oh it cannot be

He walked quickly toward him But father what about your patents
They cant rob you of them Suppose this mans motor is better

Richard did not move He seemed unwilling to look his son in the face

Let me take hold of this thing Oliver was bending over him now his
arms about his neck Ill see Mr Slade at once I met him this
morning and told him you were here and he is coming to call on you He
has always stood by me and will now These people who have disappointed
you are not the only ones who have got money Mr Slade you know is
now a banker himself I will begin tomorrow to fight this new man
who

No no my son you must do nothing of the kind said Richard leaning
his cheek wearily against Olivers hand as if for warmth and
protection but still looking into the fire It would not be right to
take from him what he has honestly earned The lifting power of his
machine is four times my own and the adjustment of the levers much
simpler He has only accomplished what I failed to do I am not quite
sure but I think he uses the same arrangement of levers that I do but
everything else is his Such a man is to be helped not worried with
lawsuits No my son I must bear it as best I may Your poor mother
He stopped suddenly and passed his hand over his eyes and in a broken
halting voice added Ive tried so hard to make her old age happier
I fear for the result when the news reaches her And you and this poor
girland he reached out his hand to Margaretthis is the part that
is hardest to bear

Oliver disengaged his arm from his fathers neck and walked up and down
the room Madge watching him His mind was searching about for some way
to stem the tide of disaster Every movement of his body expressing his
determination He was not thinking of himself He saw only Madge and
his mother Then he turned again and faced his father

Will you let me try he urged in a firm voice

No Oliver Positively no

As he spoke he straightened himself in his chair and turned toward
Oliver His voice had regained something of its oldtime ring and
force To rob a man of the work of his brain is worse than to take his
purse You will agree with me I know when you think it over Mr
Gorton had never heard of my invention when he perfected his nor had I
ever heard of his when I perfected mine He is taking nothing from me
how can I take anything from him Give me your hand my son I am not
feeling very well His voice fell again as if the effort had been too
much for him I think I will go back to the hotel A nights rest will
do me good

He rose slowly from his chair steadied himself by holding to Olivers
strong arm stood for an instant looking into Margarets eyes and
said with infinite tenderness

Come close my daughter and kiss me

She put her arms about him cuddling her head against his soft cheek
smoothing his gray hair with her palm

My child he said you have been a delight and joy to me A woman
like you is beyond price I thank you from the bottom of my heart for
loving my son

With something of his old manner he again straightened himself up
threw his shoulders back as if strengthened by some new determination
walked firmly across the room and picked up his cloak As he stood
waiting for Oliver to place it about his shoulders he put his hand to
his side with a quick movement as if smitten by some sudden pain
staggered backward his head upon his breast and would have sunk to
the floor but for Olivers hand Margaret sprang forward and caught his
other arm

Its nothing my son he said between his gasps for breath holding
on to Oliver A sudden giddiness Im often subject to it I perhaps
got up too quickly It will pass over Let me sit down for a moment

Half supporting him Oliver put his arm about his father and laid him
on the lounge

As Richards head touched the cushion that Margaret had made ready he
gave a quick gasp half rose as if to breathe the better and fell back
unconscious


When the doctor arrived Richard was lying on Margarets bed where
Oliver had carried him he had rallied a little and had then sunk into
a deep sleep Margaret sat beside him watching every breath he drew
the scalding tears streaming down her face

The physician bent closer and pressed his ear to the sleeping mans
breast

Has he been subject to these attacks he said in a grave tone

I know of only one some years ago the year the war broke out but he
recovered then very quickly answered Oliver

Is your mother living

Yes

Better send her word at once




CHAPTER XXV

SMOULDERING COALS


The night wind sighed through the old sycamores of Kennedy Square A
soft haze the harbinger of the coming spring filled the air The cold
moon hanging low bleached the deserted steps of the silent houses to
a ghostly white

In the Horn mansion a dim light burned in Richards room and another in
the lower hall Everywhere else the house was dark

Across the Square in Miss Clendennings boudoir a small wood fire
tempering the chill of the April night slumbered in its bed of ashes
or awakened with fitful starts its restless blaze illumining the
troubled face of Margaret Grant The girls eyes were fixed on the
dying coals her chin in her hand the browngold of her wonderful hair
goldred in the firelight Now and then she would lift her head as if
listening for some approaching footstep Miss Clendenning sat beside
her leaning over the hearth in her favorite attitude her tiny feet
resting on the fender

The years had touched the little lady but lightly since that night when
she sat in this same spot and Oliver had poured out his heart to her
She was the same dainty precise lovable old maid that she had been in
the old days of Kennedy Square when the crocuses bloomed in the
flowerbeds and its drawingrooms were filled with the wit and fashion
of the day Since that fatal night when Richard had laid away his
violin and brother had been divided against brother and Kennedy Square
had become the stamping ground of armed men she had watched by the
bedsides of a thousand wounded soldiers regardless of which flag they
had battled under The service had not withered her Time had simply
stood still forgetting the sum of its years while it marked her with
perennial sweetness

Im afraid hes worse Margaret said breaking the silence of the
room as she turned to Miss Clendenning or Ollie would have been here
before this Dr Wallace was to go to the house at eleven and now it
is nearly twelve

The doctor may have been detained Miss Clendenning answered There
is much sickness in town

For a time neither spoke Only the low muttering of the fire could be
heard or the turning of some restless coal

Margaret Miss Clendenning said at lastit had always been
Margaret with the little lady ever since the day she had promised
Oliver to love the woman whom he loved and it was still Margaret
when the women met for the first time in the gray dawn at the station
and Miss Clendenning herself helped lead Richard out of the
trainThere is a bright side to every trouble But for this illness
you would never have known Olivers mother as she really is All her
prejudices melted away as soon as she looked into your face She loves
you better every day and she is learning to depend on you just as
Richard and Oliver have done

I hope she will the young woman answered without moving It breaks
my heart to see her suffer as she does I see my own mother in her so
often She is different in many ways but she is the same
underneathso gentle and so kind and she is so big and broadminded
too I am ashamed to think of all the bitter feelings I used to have in
my heart toward her

She stopped abruptly her hands tightly folded in her lap her
shoulders straightened Margarets confessions were always made in this
determined way head thrown back like a soldiers as though a new
resolve had been born even while an old sin was being confessed

Go on said Miss Clendenning I understand You mean that you did
not know her

No but I thought her narrow and proud and that she disliked me for
influencing Oliver in his art and that she wanted to keep him from me
and from my ideals Oh Ive been very very wicked

Not wicked my dearonly human You are not the first woman who did
not want to divide a love with a mother

But it wasnt exactly that dear Cousin Lavinia I had never met
anyone who obeyed his mother as Ollie did andandI almost hated her
for being his guide and counsel whenoh not because she did not love
him too just as I didbut because I thought that I could really help
him mostbecause I believed in his talent and she did not and because
I knew all the time that she was ruining him keeping him back
spoiling his career and

Again she stopped and straightened herself her beautiful head held
higher Those who knew Margaret well would have known that the worst
part of her confession was yet to come

I suppose I was hurt too she said slowly accentuating each pause
with a slight movement of the head That I was LITTLE enough and MEAN
enough and HORRID enough for that But he was always talking of his
mother as though she never did anything but sit still in that white
shawl of hers listening to music while everybody waited on her and
came to her for advice And I always thought that she couldnt
understand me nor any other woman who wanted to work When Ollie talked
of you all and of what you did at home I couldnt help feeling she
must think that I and all my people belonged to some different race and
that when she saw me she would judge me by some petty thing that
displeased her the cut of my skirt or the way I carried my hands or
something else equally trivial and that she would use that kind of
thing against me and perhaps tell Ollie too Father judged Oliver in
that way He thought that Ollies joyousness and his courtesy even his
way of taking off his hat and holding it in his two hands for a
momentyouve seen him do it a hundred timeswas only a proof of his
Southern shiftlessnesscaring more for manners than for work Mother
didnt she understood Ollie better and so did John but father never
could Thats why I wouldnt come when you asked me You wouldnt have
judged me I know but I thought that she would And nowoh Im so
sorry I could cry

It was only another of the mistakes and misunderstandings that divided
us all at that time my dear Miss Clendenning answered This
dreadful war could have been averted if people had only come together
and understood each other I did not think so then but I do now

And you dont think me wicked Cousin Lavinia Margaret asked with a
sudden relaxation of her figure and something infinitely childlike and
appealing in her tone You really dont think me wicked do you

Not wicked dear only human as I said a moment ago Yet you have
been stronger than I You have held on and won I let go and lost

Margaret bent forward and laid her finger on Miss Clendennings knee

Lost what Cousin Lavinia she asked in surprise

My lover

When

When I was just your age

Did he die asked Margaret in awed tones overcome all at once with
the solemnity of the hour and a strange new note in Miss Lavinias
voice

No he married someone else

He nevernever loved you then There was a positiveness now in her
intonations

Yes he did with all his heart His mother came between us

Again silence fell on the room Margaret would not look at Miss
Clendenning The little old maid had suddenly opened the windows of her
heart but whether to let a longcaged sorrow out or some friendly
sympathy in she could not tell

May I know about it There was a softer cadence now in the girls
voice

It would only make you unhappy dear It was all over forty years or
more ago Sallie when she saw you put her arms about you You had
only to come together The oftener she sees you the more she will love
you My lovers mother shut the door in my face

In your face Why

Margaret moved closer to Miss Clendenning stirred by a sudden impulse
as if she could even now protect her from one who had hurt her

Miss Lavinia bent forward and picked up the brass tongs that lay on the
fender at her feet She saw Margarets gesture but she did not turn
her head Her eyes were still watching the smouldering embers

For no reason dear that you or any other Northern woman could
understand An old family quarrel that began before I was born

Margarets cheeks flushed and a determined look came into her face

The coward I would not have cared what his mother or anybody else
did or how they quarrelled If I loved you I would have married you in
spite of everything

And so would he She was balancing the tongs in her hand now her
eyes still on the fire She had not looked at Margaret once

What happened then

Miss Clendenning leaned forward spread the tongs in her little hands
lifted an ember and tucked it closer to its neighbor The charred mass
crumbled at the touch and fell into a heap of broken coals

I am a Clendenning my dear that is all she answered slowly

Margaret stared at her with wideopen eyes That a life should be
wrecked for a mere question of family pride was something her mind
could not fathom

Have you regretted it since Cousin Lavinia she asked calmly She
wanted to follow it out now to the end

Miss Clendenning heaped the broken coals closer together laid the
tongs back in their place on the fender and turning to Margaret
said with a sigh

Dont ask me my dear I never dare ask myself but do you keep your
hand close in Olivers Remember dear closeclose Then you will
never know the bitterness of a lonely life

She rose from her seat bent down and taking Margarets cheeks
between her palms kissed her on the forehead

Margaret put her arms about the little lady and was about to draw her
nearer when the front door opened and a step was heard in the hall
Miss Lavinia raised herself erect listening to the sound

Hark she cried theres the dear fellow nowand she advanced to
meet him her gentle countenance once more serene

Olivers face as he entered the room told the story

Not worse Margaret exclaimed starting from her chair

Yesmuch worse I have just sent word to Uncle Natand he kissed
them both Put on your things at once The doctor is anxious

Miss Lavinia caught up her cloak handed Margaret her shawl and the
three hurried out the frontdoor and along the Square passing the
Pancoast house now turned into offices its doors and windows covered
with signs and the Clayton Mansion surmounted by a flagpole and
still used by the Government Entering the park they crossed the site
of the once lovely flowerbeds now trampled flatas was everything
else in the groundsand so on to the marble steps of the Horn Mansion

Mrs Horn met them at the top of the stairs She put her arms silently
about Margaret kissed her tenderly and led her into Richards room
Oliver and Miss Clendenning stood at the door

The master lay under the canopy of the fourpost bedstead his eyes
closed the soft white hair lost in the pillows the pale face tinged
with the glow of the night lamp Dr Wallace was standing by the bed
watching the labored breathing of the prostrate man Old Hannah sat on
the floor at Richards feet She was rocking to and fro making no
sign crooning inaudibly to herself listening to every sound

Margaret sank to her knees and laid her cheek on the coverlet She
wanted to touch something that was close to him

The head of the sick man turned uneasily The doctor bent noiselessly
down put his ears close to the patients breast touched his pulse
with his fingers and laid his hand on his forehead

Better send for some hot water he whispered to Mrs Horn when he had
regained her side Margaret overheard and started to rise from her
knees but Mrs Horn waved her back Hannah will get it she said
and stooped close to the old woman to give the order There was a
restrained calmness in her manner that sent a shiver through Margaret
She remembered just such an expression on her mothers face when her
own father lay dying

The old servant lifted herself slowly and with bent head and crouching
body crept out of the room without turning her face toward her master
The superstition of the negroes about the eyes of a dying man kept hers
close to the floorshe did not want Richard to look at her

Dr Wallace detected the movementhe knew its causeand passed out of
the sick chamber to where Oliver stood with Miss Clendenning

Better go down Oliver and see that the hot water is sent up right
away he said Poor old Hannah seems to have lost her head

Has there been any further change Doctor Oliver asked as he
started for the stairs

No not since you went He is holding his own His hands feel cold
that is all To Miss Lavinia he said It is only a question of
hours and went back into the room

Oliver hurried after Hannah He intended to send Malachi up with the
hot water and then persuade the old woman to go to bed When he reached
the lower hall it was empty so were the parlors and the diningroom
At the kitchendoor he met Hannah She had filled the pitcher and had
turned to carry it upstairs Oliver stopped her

Where is Malachi aunty

Hannah pointed through the open door to Richards little shop in the
back yard and hurried on Oliver walked quickly through the damp
brickpaved yard now filled with the sombre shadows of the night and
pushed open the green door The place was dark except for a slant of
moonlight which had struggled through the windowpane and was
illumining the motor where it rested in its customary place under the
sash

Malachi are you here

A sob was the only answer

Oliver stepped inside The old man was on his knees his head and arms
lying flat on Richards workbench Oliver bent down and laid his hand
on the old servants head

Mally

I hear ye Marse Ollie an I hearn Hannah I tell you same as I tol
heraint no use fetchin no water aint no use no mo for no doctor
aint no use aint no use I aint never goin to say no mo to him
Chairs all ready Marse Richard I aint never goin to wait on him
no mo Come close to me Marse Ollie get down an let me tell ye
son

He had lifted his head now and was looking up into Olivers eyes the
tears streaming down his face

He freed me he gimme a home He aint neber done nothin but love me
an take care o me When I bin sick he come in an he set by me You
got a fever I think Malachi he say Go to bed dis minute Cold is
you Git dat blanket outn my room an put it on yo bed Dont let me

so Marse Richard Lemme see hed say Dats so dat aint fit fer
nobody to wear Go upstairs to my closet Malachi an git dat coat I
was awearin yisterday I reckon I kin git on widout it

Malachi had his head in his hands now his body swaying from side to
side Oliver stood silent

When he come home de udder day an I lif him in de bed he say
Dont you strain yosef Malachi Member you aint spry as you
was Oh Gawd Oh Gawd Whats Malachi gwine to do

Oliver sat down beside him There was nothing to say The old servants
grief was only his own

Ebery night Marse Ollie sence he bin sick I git so lonesome dat I
wait till de house git still an den I git outn de bed and crope
downstairs an listen at de bedroom door Den I hear de mistis say
In pain dear and he say No Sallie An den I crope up agin an
go to bed kind o comforted I was down agin las nightmos
mawninalistenin an de mistis say Kin I do sumpin to ease de
pain dear an he dont answer only groan and den I hear de bed
creak an dat SHORT BREF COME Pats the sign I knows it In de
mawnin hell be gone Cant fool Malachi I knows de signs

A gentle tap at the front door on the street sounded through the
stillness Oliver had left all the intervening doors between the
diningroom and the shop open in his search for Malachi

The old servant with the lifelong habit upon him started up to answer
the summons

No Mally stay here said Oliver Ill go Some neighbor perhaps
wanting to know how father is

Oliver walked rapidly through the yard tiptoed through the hall and
carefully turned the knob

Amos Cobb stepped in

I saw the light Oliver he said in a low tone and I knew you were
up I have an important telegram from New York in answer to one I sent
this morning from my office here Would it be possible for me to see
your father I know it is very late but the matter is most urgent

Im afraid not Mr Cobb He is very low

Not serious Amos exclaimed in alarm

Doctor Wallace thinks it is

You dont tell me so I had no idea he was so ill

Nor did we sir a change for the worse set in this evening

Amos leaned back against the wall his hat in his hand The light from
the eightsided hall lamp fell on his thickset shoulders and square
determined honest face The keeneyed blunt Vermonters distress at
the news was sincere and heartfelt

Could I attend to it Mr Cobb asked Oliver

Perhaps so Ive got those fellows now where the hair is short and
Im going to make em pay for it

What is it about

Amos Cobb took a double telegram from his pocket It was closely
written and contained a long message

Its about your fathers patents This telegram is from the attorneys
of the Gorton

Oliver laid his fingers on the open telegram in Cobbs hand and said
in a positive tone

He will not rob this man of his rights Mr Cobb

Its not that It is the other way The attorneys of the Gorton
Company refuse to rob your father of HIS rights Further the bankers
will not endorse the Gorton stock until your fathers patentI think
it is No 18131and he examined the telegram closelyyes August
13 1856 18131is out of the way They are prepared to pay a large
price for it at once and have asked me to see your father and arrange
it on the best terms I can The offer is most liberal I dont feel
like risking an hours delay thats why Im here so late What had I
better do

Oliver caught Mr Cobbs hand in his and a flash of exultant joy passed
over his face as he thought of his fathers triumph and all it meant to
him Then Margarets eyes looked into his and next his mothers he
knew what it meant to them all Then the wasted figure of his father
rose in his mind and his tears blinded him

Amos stood watching him trying to read his thoughts He saw the tears
glistening on Olivers lashes but he misunderstood the cause Only the
practical side of the situation appealed to the Vermonter at the
moment These New York men had cast discredit on his endorsement of
Richards priority in the invention and had tried to ignore them both
Now he held them tight in his grasp Horn was a rich man

Ill be very quiet Oliver he continued in a halfpleading tone
and will make it as short as I can Just let me go up It cant hurt
himand he laid his hand on Olivers shoulder with a tenderness that
surprised him I would never forgive myself if he should pass away
without learning of his success Hes worked so hard

Before Oliver could reply another low tap was heard at the door Cobb
turned the knob gently and Nathan stepped inside the hall The old man
had gone home and to bed tired out with his ceaseless watching by
Richards bedside and was only half dressed

Still with us he asked in trembling tones his eyes searching
Olivers face Oh thank God Thank God Ill go up at onceand he
passed on toward the stairway Amos and Oliver followed

As Nathans foot touched the first step Doctor Wallaces voice sounded
over the bannisters

Oliver Malachi Both of youquick The three bounded noiselessly
upstairs and entered the room Richard lay high up on the pillows the
face in shadow his eyes closed Margaret was still on her knees her
head on the coverlet Mrs Horn stood on the other side of the bed the
same calm fixed expression on her face as if she was trying to read
the unknowable Dr Wallace sat on a chair beside his patient his
fingers on Richards pulse

Is he gone asked Oliver stepping quickly to his fathers side his
voice choking

Dr Wallace shook his head

Amos Cobb drew near and whispered in the doctors ear The old
physician listened quietly and nodded in assent Then he leaned over
his patient

Mr Cobb has some good news for you Richard he said calmly The
bankers have recognized your patents and are ready to pay the money

The dying mans eyes opened slowly

Amos stepped in front of the doctor and bent down close to the bed

Its all right Hornall right They cant get along without your
first patent Heres the telegram He spoke with an encouraging
cheeriness in his voice as one would in helping a child across a
dangerous place

The brow of the dying man suddenly cleared the eyes burned with their
old steadiness then the lips parted

Read it he muttered The words were barely audible

Cobb held the paper so the dim light should fall upon it and read the
contents slowly emphasizing each word

Raise me up

The voice seemed to come from his throat as if his lungs were closed
Oliver started forward but Cobb being nearer slipped his arm under
the wasted figure and with the tenderness of a woman lifted him
carefully tucking the pillows in behind the thin shoulders for better
support Oliver sank softly to his knees beside Margaret

Again the thin lips parted

Read it once more The voice came stronger now

Amos held the paper to the light and the words of the telegram like
the low tick of a clock again sounded through the hushed room

For a brief instant the inventors eyes sought each face in turn As
his gaze rested on Margaret and Oliver he moved his thin white hand
slowly along the coverlet and laid it first on Olivers and next on
Margarets head Then with a triumphant look lighting his face he
lifted his arms toward his wife

Sallie he called and fell back on his pillow lifeless




CHAPTER XXVI

THE LIGHT OF A NEW DAY


The crocuses are abloom once more The lilac buds are bursting with
the joy of the new spring A veil of silvergray floats over Moose
Hillock The idle brook like a truant boy dances in the sunshine
singing to itself as it leaps from ledge to pool

All the doors and windows of the big studio on the side looking down
the valley are open to the morning air Through one of these Margaret
has just entered her arms full of apple blossoms One spray she places
in a slender blue jar the delicate blush of the buds and the pale
green of the leaves harmonizing with the goldbrown of her marvellous
hair as she buries her face among them All about the spacious room are
big easels halffinished portraits rich draperies wide divans old
brass and rare porcelain

In an easy chair close to the window with the fragrance of the
blossoms around her sits a whitehaired old lady with a gossamer shawl
about her shoulders She is watching Margaret as she moves about the
room her eyes brimming with tenderness and pride Now and then she
looks toward a door leading into the bedroom beyond as if expecting
someone

Oliver stands before his easel his palette and brushes in his hand He
is studying the effect of a pat of color he has just laid on the
portrait of a young girl in a rich gownthe fourth fulllength he has
painted this yearthe most important being the one of his father
ordered by the Historical Society of Kennedy Square and painted from
Margarets sketches

Malachithe old man is very feeblemoves slowly around a square table
covered with a snowwhite cloth with seats set for fourone a high
chair with little arms In his hands are a heap of cups and
saucersthe same Spode cups and saucers he looked after so carefully
in the old house at home These he places near the smoking coffeeurn

Suddenly a merry roguish laugh is heard and a little fellow with
goldbrown hair and big blue eyes peers in through the slowly opening
door

The old servant stops and his withered face breaks into a smile

Is dat you honey he cries with a laugh Come along son Yo
chars all ready Marse Richard

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
To donate please visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate


Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For forty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

 wwwgutenbergorg

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
