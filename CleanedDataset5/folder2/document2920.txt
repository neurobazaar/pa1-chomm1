 through the French window with a wet Scotch terrier in her
 arms She vanishes through the door left A little pause and

 halts where the tracks of water cease at the door left A

 CHARACTERS

 DURING THE GREAT WAR EVENING



 An empty room The curtains drawn and gas turned low The
 furniture and walls give a colourimpression as of greens and
 beetroot There is a prevalence of plush A fireplace on the
 Left a sofa a small table the curtained window is at the
 back On the table in a common pot stands a little plant of
 maidenhair fern fresh and green

 Enter from the door on the Right a GIRL and a YOUNG OFFICER in
 khaki The GIRL wears a discreet dark dress hat and veil and
 stained yellow gloves The YOUNG OFFICER is tall with a fresh
 open face and kindly eager blue eyes he is a little lame The
 GIRL who is evidently at home moves towards the gas jet to
 turn it up then changes her mind and going to the curtains
 draws them apart and throws up the window Bright moonlight
 comes flooding in Outside are seen the trees of a little
 Square She stands gazing out suddenly turns inward with a
 shiver

YOUNG OFF I say whats the matter You were crying when I spoke

YOUNG OFF Oh not a bit youre quite out I assure you when we
made the attack where I got wounded there wasnt a single man in my

still a good girl as I was once you know and you took me to your
mother and your sisters and you said Here is a little German girl
that has no work and no money and no friends They will say Oh

 The OFFICER is silent staring at her

GIRL You see

YOUNG OFF Muttering Im sure there are people

GIRL No They would not take a German even if she was good
Besides I dont want to be good any moreI am not a humbug I have
learned to be bad Arent you going to kees me niice boy

She puts her face close to his Her eyes trouble him he draws back

YOUNG OFF Dont Id rather not if you dont mind She looks at
him fixedly with a curious inquiring stare Its stupid I dont

Itsitsit isnt mean you know Dont come too close

GIRL Oh You are funShe stops Doesnt it light No Zeps
tonight When they burnwhat a orrble death And all the people

YOUNG OFF Turning sharply Hate I dont know

GIRL I dont hate even the EnglishI despise them I despise my
people too even more because they began this war Oh I know that
I despise all the peoples Why haf they made the world so miserable
why haf they killed all our liveshundreds and thousands and
millions of livesall for noting They haf made a bad world
everybody hating and looking for the worst everywhere They haf
made me bad I know I believe no more in anything What is there
to believe in Is there a God No Once I was teaching little
English children their prayersisnt that funnee I was reading to
them about Christ and love I believed all those things Now I
believe noting at allno one who is not a fool or a liar can
believe I would like to work in a ospital I would like to go and
elp poor boys like you Because I am a German they would throw me
out a undred times even if I was good It is the same in Germany
in France in Russia everywhere But do you think I will believe in
Love and Christ and God and all thatNot I I think we are animals
thats all Oh yes you fancy it is because my life has spoiled
me It is not that at allthat is not the worst thing in life The
men I take are not niice like you but its their nature andthey
help me to live which is something for me anyway No it is the
men who think themselves great and good and make the war with their
talk and their hate killing us allkilling all the boys like you
and keeping poor People in prison and telling us to go on hating
and all these dreadful coldblood creatures who write in the papers
the same in my countryjust the same it is because of all of them
that I think we are only animals

 The YOUNG OFFICER gets up acutely miserable

 She follows him with her eyes

GIRL Dont mind me talkin niice boy I dont know anyone to
talk to If you dont like it I can be quiet as a mouse

YOUNG OFF Oh go on Talk away Im not obliged to believe you
and I dont

 She too is on her feet now leaning against the wall her
 dark dress and white face just touched by the slanting
 moonlight Her voice comes again slow and soft and bitter

GIRL Well look here niice boy what sort of world is it where
millions are being tortured for no fault of theirs at all A
beautiful world isnt it Umbog Silly rot as you boys call it
You say it is all Comrades and braveness out there at the front
and people dont think of themselves Well I dont think of myself
veree much What does it matter I am lost now anyway But I
think of my people at ome how they suffer and grieve I think of
all the poor people there and here how lose those they love and
all the poor prisoners Am I not to think of them And if I do how
am I to believe it a beautiful world niice boy

 He stands very still staring at her

GIRL Look here We haf one life each and soon it is over Well
I think that is lucky

YOUNG OFF No Theres more than that

GIRL Softly Ah You think the war is fought for the future you
are giving your lives for a better world arent you

YOUNG OFF We must fight till we win

GIRL Till you win My people think that too All the peoples
think that if they win the world will be better But it will not
you know it will be much worse anyway

 He turns away from her and catches up his cap Her voice
 follows him

GIRL I dont care which win I dont care if my country is beaten
I despise them allanimalsanimals Ah Dont go niice boy I
will be quiet now

 He has taken some notes from his tunic pocket he puts then on
 the table and goes up to her

YOUNG OFF Goodnight

GIRL Plaintively Are you really going Dont you like me
enough

YOUNG OFF Yes I like you

GIRL It is because I am German then

YOUNG OFF No

GIRL Then why wont you stay

YOUNG OFF With a shrug If you must knowbecause you upset me

GIRL Wont you kees me once

 He bends puts his lips to her forehead But as he takes them
 away she throws her head back presses her mouth to his and
 clings to him

YOUNG OFF Sitting down suddenly Dont I dont want to feel a
brute

GIRL Laughing You are a funny boy but you are veree good Talk
to me a little then No one talks to me Tell me haf you seen
many German prisoners

YOUNG OFF Sighing A good many

GIRL Any from the Rhine

YOUNG OFF Yes I think so

GIRL Were they veree sad

YOUNG OFF Some were some were quite glad to be taken

GIRL Did you ever see the Rhine It will be wonderful tonight
The moonlight will be the same there and in Rooshia too and France
everywhere and the trees will look the same as here and people will
meet under them and make love just as here Oh isnt it stupid the
war As if it were not good to be alive

YOUNG OFF You cant tell how good it is to be alive till youre
facing death You dont live till then And when a whole lot of you
feel like thatand are ready to give their lives for each other
its worth all the rest of life put together

 He stops ashamed of such sentiment before this girl who
 believes in nothing

GIRL Softly How were you wounded niice boy

YOUNG OFF Attacking across open ground four machine bullets got me
at one go off

GIRL Werent you veree frightened when they ordered you to attack

 He shakes his head and laughs

YOUNG OFF It was great We did laugh that morning They got me
much too soon thougha swindle

GIRL Staring at him You laughed

YOUNG OFF Yes And what do you think was the first thing I was
conscious of next morning My old Colonel bending over me and giving
me a squeeze of lemon If you knew my Colonel youd still believe in
things There is something you know behind all this evil After
all you can only die once and if its for your countryall the
better

 Her face in the moonlight with intent eyes touched up with
 black has a most strange otherworld look

GIRL No I believe in nothing not even in my country My heart is
dead

YOUNG OFF Yes you think so but it isnt you know or you
wouldnt have been crying when I met you

GIRL If it were not dead do you think I could live my lifewalking
the streets every night pretending to like strange men never
hearing a kind word never talking for fear I will be known for a
German Soon I shall take to drinking then I shall be Kaput veree
quick You see I am practical I see things clear Tonight I am a
little emotional the moon is funny you know But I live for myself
only now I dont care for anything or anybody

YOUNG OFF All the same just now you were pitying your folk at
home and prisoners and that

GIRL Yees because they suffer Those who suffer are like meI
pity myself thats all I am different from your English women I
see what I am doing I do not let my mind become a turnip just
because I am no longer moral

YOUNG OFF Nor your heart either for all you say

GIRL Niice boy you are veree obstinate But all that about love
is umbog We love ourselves noting more

 At that intense soft bitterness in her voice he gets up
 feeling stifled and stands at the window A newspaper boy some
 way off is calling his wares The GIRLs fingers slip between
 his own and stay unmoving He looks round into her face In
 spite of makeup it has a queer unholy touching beauty

YOUNG OFF With an outburst No we dont only love ourselves
there is more I cant explain but theres something great theres
kindnessandand

 The shouting of newspaper boys grows louder and their cries
 passionately vehement clash into each other and obscure each
 word His head goes up to listen her hand tightens within his
 armshe too is listening The cries come nearer hoarser more
 shrill and clamorous the empty moonlight outside seems suddenly
 crowded with figures footsteps voices and a fierce distant
 cheering Great victorygreat victory Official British
 Eavy defeat of the Uns Many thousand prisoners Eavy
 defeat It speeds by intoxicating filling him with a fearful
 joy he leans far out waving his cap and cheering like a
 madman the night seems to flutter and vibrate and answer He
 turns to rush down into the street strikes against something
 soft and recoils The GIRL stands with hands clenched and
 face convulsed panting All confused with the desire to do
 something he stoops to kiss her hand She snatches away her
 fingers sweeps up the notes he has put down and holds them out
 to him

GIRL Take themI will not haf your English moneytake them

 Suddenly she tears them across twice thrice lets the bits
 flutter to the floor and turns her back on him He stands
 looking at her leaning against the plushcovered table her head
 down a dark figure in a dark room with the moonlight
 sharpening her outline Hardly a moment he stays then makes
 for the door When he is gone she still stands there her chin
 on her breast with the sound in her ears of cheering of
 hurrying feet and voices crying Eavy Defeat stands in the
 centre of a pattern made by the fragments of the tornup notes
 staring out unto the moonlight seeing not this hated room and
 the hated Square outside but a German orchard and herself a
 little girl plucking apples a big dog beside her and a
 hundred other pictures such as the drowning see Then she
 sinks down on the floor lays her forehead on the dusty carpet
 and presses her body to it Mechanically she sweeps together
 the scattered fragments of notes assembling them with the dust
 into a little pile as of fallen leaves and dabbling in it with
 her fingers while the tears run down her cheeks

GIRL Defeat Der Vaterland Defeat One shillin

 Then suddenly in the moonlight she sits up and begins to
 sing with all her might Die Wacht am Rhein And outside men
 pass singing Rule Britannia

SCENE The Stage of a Theatre

Action continuous though the curtain is momentarily lowered
according to that action



 PUNCH AND GO

 The Scene is the stage of the theatre set for the dress
 rehearsal of the little play Orpheus with his Lute The
 curtain is up and the audience though present is not supposed
 to be The set scene represents the end section of a room with
 wide French windows Back Centre fully opened on to an apple
 orchard in bloom The Back Wall with these French windows is
 set only about ten feet from the footlights and the rest of the
 stage is orchard What is visible of the room would indicate
 the study of a writing man of culture  NoteIf found
 advantageous for scenic purposes this section of room can be
 changed to a broad verandah or porch with pillars supporting its
 roof In the wall Stage Left is a curtained opening across
 which the curtain is half drawn Stage Right of the French
 windows is a large armchair turned rather towards the window
 with a book rest attached on which is a volume of the
 Encyclopedia Britannica while on a stool alongside are writing
 materials such as a man requires when he writes with a pad on
 his knees On a little table close by is a readinglamp with a
 dark green shade A crude light from the floats makes the stage
 stare the only person on it is MR FORESON the stage manager
 who is standing in the centre looking upwards as if waiting for
 someone to speak He is a short broad man rather blank and
 fatal From the back of the auditorium or from an empty box
 whichever is most convenient the producer MR BLEWITT VANE a
 man of about thirty four with his hair brushed back speaks

VANE Mr Foreson

FORESON Sir

VANE Well do that lighting again

 FORESON walks straight of the Stage into the wings Right

 A pause

Mr Foreson Crescendo Mr Foreson

 FORESON walks on again from Right and shades his eyes

VANE For goodness sake stand by Well do that lighting again
Check your floats

FORESON Speaking up into the prompt wings Electrics

VOICE OF ELECTRICS Hallo

FORESON Give it us again Check your floats

 The floats go down and there is a sudden blinding glare of
 blue lights in which FORESON looks particularly ghastly

VANE Great Scott What the blazes Mr Foreson

 FORESON walks straight out into the wings Left Crescendo

Mr Foreson

FORESON Reappearing Sir

VANE Tell Miller to come down

FORESON Electrics Mr Blewitt Vane wants to speak to you Come

VANE Tell Herbert to sit in that chair

 FORESON walks straight out into the Right wings

Mr Foreson

FORESON Reappearing Sir

VANE Dont go off the stage FORESON mutters

 ELECTRICS appears from the wings Stage Left He is a dark
 thinfaced man with rather spikey hair

ELECTRICS Yes Mr Vane

VANE Look

ELECTRICS Thats what Id got marked Mr Vane

VANE Once for all what I want is the orchard in full moonlight
and the room dark except for the reading lamp Cut off your front
battens

 ELECTRICS withdraws Left FORESON walks off the Stage into the
 Right wings

Mr Foreson

FORESON Reappearing Sir

VANE See this marked right Now come on with it I want to get
some beauty into this

 While he is speaking HERBERT the call boy appears from the
 wings Right a mercurial youth of about sixteen with a wide
 mouth

FORESON Maliciously Here you are then Mr Vane Herbert sit
in that chair

 HERBERT sits an the armchair with an air of perfect peace

VANE Now All the lights go out In a wail Great Scott

 A throaty chuckle from FORESON in the darkness The light
 dances up flickers shifts grows steady falling on the
 orchard outside The reading lamp darts alight and a piercing
 little glare from it strikes into the auditorium away from
 HERBERT

In a terrible voice Mr Foreson

FORESON Sir

VANE Lookatthatshade

 FORESON mutters walks up to it and turns it round so that the
 light shines on HERBERTS legs

On his face on his face

 FORESON turns the light accordingly

FORESON Is that what you want Mr Vane

VANE Yes Now mark that

FORESON Up into wings Right Electrics

ELECTRICS Hallo

FORESON Mark that

VANE My God

 The blue suddenly becomes amber

 The blue returns All is steady HERBERT is seen diverting
 himself with an imaginary cigar

Mr Foreson

FORESON Sir

VANE Ask him if hes got that

FORESON Have you got that

ELECTRICS Yes

VANE Now pass to the change Take your floats off altogether

FORESON Calling up Floats out They go out

VANE Cut off that lamp The lamp goes out Put a little amber in
your back batten Mark that Now pass to the end Mr Foreson

FORESON Sir

VANE Black out

FORESON Calling up Black out

 The lights go out

VANE Give us your first lightinglamp on And then the two
changes Quick as you can Put some pep into it Mr Foreson

FORESON Sir

VANE Stand for me where Miss Hellgrove comes in FORESON crosses
to the window No noby the curtain

 FORESON takes his stand by the curtain and suddenly the three
 lighting effects are rendered quickly and with miraculous
 exactness

Good Leave it at that Well begin Mr Foreson send up to Mr
Frust

 He moves from the auditorium and ascends on to the Stage by
 some steps Stage Right

FORESON Herb Call the boss and tell beginners to stand by
Sharp now

 HERBERT gets out of the chair and goes off Right

 FORESON is going off Left as VANE mounts the Stage

VANE Mr Foreson

FORESON Reappearing Sir

VANE I want Props

FORESON In a stentorian voice Props

 Another motheaten man appears through the French windows

VANE Is that boulder firm

PROPS Going to where in front of the backcloth and apparently
among its apple trees lies the counterfeitment of a mossy boulder
he puts his foot on it If you dont put too much weight on it
sir

VANE It wont creak

PROPS Nao He mounts on it and a dolorous creaking arises

VANE Make that right Let me see that lute

 PROPS produces a property lute While they scrutinize it a
 broad man with broad leathery cleanshaven face and small mouth
 occupied by the butt end of a cigar has come on to the stage
 from Stage Left and stands waiting to be noticed

PROPS Attracted by the scent of the cigar The Boss Sir

VANE Turning to PROPS Thatll do then

 PROPS goes out through the French windows

VANE To FRUST Now sir were all ready for rehearsal of
Orpheus with his Lute

FRUST In a cosmopolitan voice Orphoos with his loot That his
loot Mr Vane Why didnt he pinch something more precious Has
this highbrow curtainraiser of yours got any pep in it

VANE It has charm

FRUST Id thought of Pop goes the Weasel with little Miggs We
kind of want a cocktail before Louisa loses Mr Vane

VANE Well sir youll see

FRUST This your lighting Its a bit on the spiritool side Ive
left my glass Guess Ill sit in the front row Haf a minute Who

VANE George Fleetway

FRUST Has he got punch

VANE Its a very small part

FRUST Who are the others

VANE Guy Toone plays the Professor Vanessa Hellgrove his wife
Maude Hopkins the faun

FRUST Hm Names dont draw

VANE Theyre not expensive any of them Miss Hellgroves a find
I think

FRUST Pretty

VANE Quite

FRUST Arty

VANE Doubtfully No With resolution Look here Mr FRUST
its no use your expecting another Pop goes the Weasel

FRUST Weell if its got punch and go thatll be enough for me
Lets get to it

 He extinguishes his cigar and descends the steps and sits in
 the centre of the front row of the stalls

VANE Mr Foreson

FORESON Appearing through curtain Right Sir

VANE Beginners Take your curtain down

 He descends the steps and seats himself next to FRUST The
 curtain goes down

 A womans voice is heard singing very beautifully Sullivans
 song Orpheus with his lute with his lute made trees and the
 mountain tops that freeze etc

FRUST Some voice

 The curtain rises In the armchair the PROFESSOR is yawning
 tall thin abstracted and slightly grizzled in the hair He
 has a pad of paper over his knee ink on the stool to his right
 and the Encyclopedia volume on the stand to his leftbarricaded
 in fact by the article he is writing He is reading a page over
 to himself but the words are drowned in the sound of the song
 his WIFE is singing in the next room partly screened off by the
 curtain She finishes and stops His voice can then be heard
 conning the words of his article

PROF Orpheus symbolized the voice of Beauty the call of life
luring us mortals with his song back from the graves we dig for
ourselves Probably the ancients realized this neither more nor less
than we moderns Mankind has not changed The civilized being still
hides the faun and the dryad within its broadcloth and its silk And
yetHe stops with a driedup airrather impatiently Go on my
dear It helps the atmosphere

 The voice of his WIFE begins again gets as far as made them
 sing and stops dead just as the PROFESSORs pen is beginning
 to scratch And suddenly drawing the curtain further aside

 SHE appears Much younger than the PROFESSOR pale very
 pretty of a Botticellian type in face figure and in her
 clinging creamcoloured frock She gazes at her abstracted
 husband then swiftly moves to the lintel of the open window
 and stands looking out

THE WIFE God What beauty

PROF Looking Up Umm

THE WIFE I said God What beauty

PROF Aha

THE WIFE Looking at him Do you know that I have to repeat
everything to you nowadays

PROF What

THE WIFE That I have to repeat

PROF Yes I heard Im sorry I get absorbed

THE WIFE In all but me

PROF Startled My dear your song was helping me like anything to
get the mood This paper is the very deuceto balance between the
historical and the natural

THE WIFE Who wants the natural

PROF Grumbling Umm Wish I thought that Modern taste
History may go hang theyre all for tuppencecoloured sentiment
nowadays

THE WIFE As if to herself Is the Spring sentiment

PROF I beg your pardon my dear I didnt catch

WIFE As if against her willurged by some pentup force Beauty
beauty

PROF Thats what Im trying to say here The Orpheus legend
symbolizes to this day the call of Beauty He takes up his pen
while she continues to stare out at the moonlight Yawning Dash
it I get so sleepy I wish youd tell them to make the afterdinner
coffee twice as strong

WIFE I will

PROF How does this strike you Conning Many Renaissance
pictures especially those of Botticelli Francesca and Piero di
Cosimo were inspired by such legends as that of Orpheus and we owe a
tiny gemlike Raphael Apollo and Marsyas to the same Pagan
inspiration

WIFE We owe it more than thatrebellion against the dryasdust

PROF Quite I might develop that We owe it our revolt against
the academic or our disgust at big business and all the grossness
of commercial success We owe His voice peters out

WIFE Itlove

PROF Abstracted Eh

WIFE I said We owe it love

PROF Rather startled Possibly Buter With a dry smile
I mustnt say that herehardly

WIFE To herself and the moonlight Orpheus with his lute

PROF Most people think a lute is a sort of flute Yawning
heavily My dear if youre not going to sing again dyou mind
sitting down I want to concentrate

WIFE Im going out

PROF Mind the dew

WIFE The Christian virtues and the dew

PROF With a little dry laugh Not bad Not bad The Christian
virtues and the dew His hand takes up his pen his face droops
over his paper while his wife looks at him with a very strange face
How far we can trace the modern resurgence against the Christian
virtues to the symbolic figures of Orpheus Pan Apollo and Bacchus
might be difficult to estimate but

 During those words his WIFE has passed through the window into
 the moonlight and her voice rises singing as she goes
 Orpheus with his lute with his lute made trees

PROF Suddenly aware of something Shell get her throat bad
He is silent as the voice swells in the distance Sounds queer at
nightHm He is silentYawning The voice dies away Suddenly
his head nods he fights his drowsiness writes a word or two nods
again and in twenty seconds is asleep

 The Stage is darkened by a blackout FRUSTs voice is heard
 speaking

FRUST Whats that girls name

VANE Vanessa Hellgrove

FRUST Aha

 The Stage is lighted up again Moonlight bright on the
 orchard the room in darkness where the PROFESSORS figure is
 just visible sleeping in the chair and screwed a little more
 round towards the window From behind the mossy boulder a
 faunlike figure uncurls itself and peeps over with ears
 standing up and elbows leaning on the stone playing a rustic
 pipe and there are seen two rabbits and a fox sitting up and
 listening A shiver of wind passes blowing petals from the
 appletrees

 The FAUN darts his head towards where from Right comes slowly
 the figure of a Greek youth holding a lute or lyre which his
 fingers strike lifting out little wandering strains as of wind
 whinnying in funnels and odd corners The FAUN darts down
 behind the stone and the youth stands by the boulder playing
 his lute Slowly while he plays the whitened trunk of an
 appletree is seen to dissolve into the body of a girl with
 bare arms and feet her dark hair unbound and the face of the
 PROFESSORS WIFE Hypnotized she slowly sways towards him
 their eyes fixed on each other till she is quite close Her
 arms go out to him cling round his neck and their lips meet
 But as they meet there comes a gasp and the PROFESSOR with
 rumpled hair is seen starting from his chair his hands thrown
 up and at his horrified Oh the Stage is darkened with a
 blackout

 The voice of FRUST is heard speaking

FRUST Gee

 The Stage is lighted up again as in the opening scene The
 PROFESSOR is seen in his chair with spilt sheets of paper round
 him waking from a dream He shakes himself pinches his leg
 stares heavily round into the moonlight rises

PROF Phew Beastly dream Boof Hm He moves to the window
and calls Blanche Blanche To himself Made treesmade trees
Calling Blanche

WIFEs VOICE Yes

PROF Where are you

WIFE Appearing by the stone with her hair down Here

PROF I sayIIve been asleephad a dream Come in Ill tell
you

 She comes and they stand in the window

PROF I dreamed I saw afaun on that boulder blowing on a pipe He
looks nervously at the stone With two damned little rabbits and a
fox sitting up and listening And then from out there came our
friend Orpheus playing on his confounded lute till he actually
turned that tree there into you And gradually hehe drew you like a
snake till youerput your arms round his neck anderkissed him
Boof I woke up Most unpleasant Why Your hairs down

WIFE Yes

PROF Why

WIFE It was no dream He was bringing me to life

PROF What on earth

WIFE Do you suppose I am alive Im as dead as Euridice

PROF Good heavens Blanche whats the matter with you tonight

WIFE Pointing to the litter of papers Why dont we live instead
of writing of it She points out unto the moonlight What do we
get out of life Money fame fashion talk learning Yes And
what good are they I want to live

PROF Helplessly My dear I really dont know what you mean

WIFE Pointing out into the moonlight Look Orpheus with his
lute and nobody can see him Beauty beauty beautywe let it go
With sudden passion Beauty love the spring They should be in
us and theyre all outside

PROF My dear this isthis isawful He tries to embrace her

WIFE Avoiding himan a stilly voice Oh Go on with your
writing

PROF ImIm upset Ive never known you soso

WIFE Hysterical Well Its over Ill go and sing

PROF Soothingly There there Im sorry darling I really am
Youre kippedyoure kipped He gives and she accepts a kiss
Better

 He gravitates towards his papers

All right now

WIFE Standing still and looking at him Quite

PROF Well Ill try and finish this tonight then tomorrow we
might have a jaunt How about a theatre Theres a thingthey say
called Chinese Chops thats been running years

WIFE Softly to herself as he settles down into his chair Oh
God

 While he takes up a sheet of paper and adjusts himself she
 stands at the window staring with all her might at the boulder
 till from behind it the fauns head and shoulders emerge once
 more

PROF Very queer the power suggestion has over the mind Very
queer Theres nothing really in animism you know except the
curious shapes rocks trees and things take in certain lightseffect
they have on our imagination He looks up Whats the matter now

WIFE Startled Nothing Nothing

 Her eyes waver to him again and the FAUN vanishes She turns
 again to look at the boulder there is nothing there a little
 shiver of wind blows some petals off the trees She catches one
 of them and turning quickly goes out through the curtain

PROF Coming to himself and writing The Orpheus legend is the
erapotheosis of animism Can we accept His voice is lost in
the sound of his WIFES voice beginning again Orpheus with his
lutewith his lute made trees It dies in a sob The PROFESSOR
looks up startled as the curtain falls

FRUST Fine Fine

VANE Take up the curtain Mr Foreson

 The curtain goes up

FORESON Sir

VANE Everybody on

 He and FRUST leave their seats and ascend on to the Stage on
 which are collecting the four Players

VANE Give us some light

FORESON Electrics Turn up your floats

 The footlights go up and the blue goes out the light is crude
 as at the beginning

FRUST Id like to meet Miss Hellgrove She comes forward eagerly
and timidly He grasps her hand Miss Hellgrove I want to say I

MISS HOPK Oh Thank you Mr Frost How nice of you to say so I

FRUST His eye growing bald Mr Foreson I thought the way you
fixed that tree was very cunning I certainly did Got a match

 He takes a match from FORESON and lighting a very long cigar
 walks up Stage through the French windows followed by FORESON
 and examines the appletree

 The two Actors depart but Miss HELLGROVE runs from where she
 has been lingering by the curtain to VANE Stage Right

MISS H Oh Mr Vanedo you think He seemed quiteOh Mr Vane
ecstatically If only

VANE Pleased and happy Yes yes All rightyou were splendid

MISS H Clasping her hand How wonderful Oh Mr Vane thank you

 She clasps his hands but suddenly seeing that FRUST is coming
 back fits across into the curtain and vanishes

 The Stage in the crude light as empty now save for FRUST
 who in the French windows Centre is mumbling his cigar and
 VANE Stage Right who is looking up into the wings Stage
 Left

 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
 with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
 Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


 Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
 editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
 unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
