 The curtain rises on the BARTHWICKS diningroom large

 Electric light is burning On the large round diningtable is
 set out a tray with whisky a syphon and a silver
 cigarettebox It is past midnight

 A fumbling is heard outside the door It is opened suddenly
 JACK BARTHWICK seems to fall into the room He stands holding
 by the door knob staring before him with a beatific smile
 He is in evening dress and opera hat and carries in his hand a
 skyblue velvet ladys reticule His boyish face is freshly
 coloured and cleanshaven An overcoat is hanging on his arm

pulls a shilling out it drops and rolls away He looks for it
Beastly shilling He looks again Base ingratitude Absolutely
nothing He laughs Mus tell him Ive got absolutely nothing

 He lurches through the door and down a corridor and presently
 returns followed by JONES who is advanced in liquor JONES
 about thirty years of age has hollow cheeks black circles
 round his eyes and rusty clothes He looks as though he might
 be unemployed and enters in a hangdog manner

JACK Sh sh sh Dont you make a noise whatever you do Shu

purse lying on the floor More cats fur Puss puss He
fingers it drops it on the tray and looks at JACK Calf Fat
calf He sees his own presentment in a mirror Lifting his hands
with fingers spread he stares at it then looks again at JACK
clenching his fist as if to batter in his sleeping smiling face
Suddenly he tilts the rest o f the whisky into the glass and drinks
it With cunning glee he takes the silver box and purse and pockets
them I ll score you off too that s wot I ll do

 He gives a little snarling laugh and lurches to the door His
 shoulder rubs against the switch the light goes out There is
 a sound as of a closing outer door


 The curtain falls




The curtain rises again at once

SCENE II

 In the BARTHWICKS diningroom JACK is still asleep the
 morning light is coming through the curtains The time is
 halfpast eight WHEELER brisk person enters with a dustpan
 and MRS JONES more slowly with a scuttle

WHEELER Drawing the curtains That precious husband of yours
was round for you after youd gone yesterday Mrs Jones Wanted
your money for drink I suppose He hangs about the corner here
half the time I saw him outside the Goat and Bells when I went
to the post last night If I were you I would nt live with him I
would nt live with a man that raised his hand to me I wouldnt
put up with it Why dont you take your children and leave him If
you put up with im itll only make him worse I never can see why
because a mans married you he should knock you about

MRS JONES Slim darkeyed and darkhaired ovalfaced and with
a smooth soft even voice her manner patient her way of talking
quite impersonal she wears a blue linen dress and boots with
holes It was nearly two last night before he come home and he
wasnt himself He made me get up and he knocked me about he
didnt seem to know what he was saying or doing Of course I would
leave him but Im really afraid of what hed do to me He s such
a violent man when hes not himself

WHEELER Why dont you get him locked up Youll never have any
peace until you get him locked up If I were you Id go to the
police court tomorrow Thats what I would do

MRS JONES Of course I ought to go because he does treat me so
badly when hes not himself But you see Bettina he has a very
hard timehe s been out of work two months and it preys upon his
mind When hes in work he behaves himself much better Its when
hes out of work that hes so violent

WHEELER Well if you wont take any steps you ll never get rid of
him

MRS JONES Of course its very wearing to me I dont get my sleep
at nights And it s not as if I were getting help from him
because I have to do for the children and all of us And he throws
such dreadful things up at me talks of my having men to follow me
about Such a thing never happens no man ever speaks to me And
of course its just the other way Its what he does thats wrong
and makes me so unhappy And then he s always threatenin to cut
my throat if I leave him Its all the drink and things preying on
his mind he s not a bad man really Sometimes hell speak quite
kind to me but Ive stood so much from him I dont feel it in me
to speak kind back but just keep myself to myself And hes all
right with the children too except when hes not himself

WHEELER You mean when hes drunk the beauty

MRS JONES Yes Without change of voice Theres the young
gentleman asleep on the sofa

 They both look silently at Jack

MRS JONES At last in her soft voice He does nt look quite
himself

WHEELER Hes a young limb thats what he is It s my belief he
was tipsy last night like your husband It s another kind of
bein out of work that sets him to drink I ll go and tell Marlow
This is his job

 She goes

 Mrs Jones upon her knees begins a gentle sweeping

JACK Waking Whos there What is it

MRS JONES Its me sir Mrs Jones

JACK Sitting up and looking round Where is itwhatwhat time
is it

MRS JONES Its getting on for nine oclock sir

JACK For nine Whywhat Rising and loosening his tongue
putting hands to his head and staring hard at Mrs Jones Look
here you MrsMrs Jonesdont you say you caught me asleep
here

MRS JONES No sir of course I wont sir

JACK Its quite an accident I dont know how it happened I must
have forgotten to go to bed Its a queer thing I ve got a most
beastly headache Mind you dont say anything Mrs Jones

 Goes out and passes MARLOW in the doorway MARLOW is young
 and quiet he is cleanshaven and his hair is brushed high from
 his forehead in a coxcomb Incidentally a butler he is first
 a man He looks at MRS JONES and smiles a private smile

MARLOW Not the first time and wont be the last Looked a bit
dicky eh Mrs Jones

MRS JONES He did nt look quite himself Of course I did nt
take notice

MARLOW Youre used to them Hows your old man

MRS JONES Softly as throughout Well he was very bad last
night he did nt seem to know what he was about He was very late
and he was most abusive But now of course hes asleep

MARLOW Thats his way of finding a job eh

MRS JONES As a rule Mr Marlow he goes out early every morning
looking for work and sometimes he comes in fit to dropand of
course I cant say he does nt try to get it because he does
Trades very bad She stands quite still her fan and brush before
her at the beginning and the end of long vistas of experience
traversing them with her impersonal eye But hes not a good
husband to melast night he hit me and he was so dreadfully
abusive

MARLOW Bank oliday eh He s too fond of the Goat and Bells
thats whats the matter with him I see him at the corner late
every night He hangs about

MRS JONES He gets to feeling very low walking about all day after
work and being refused so often and then when he gets a drop in
him it goes to his head But he shouldnt treat his wife as he
treats me Sometimes I ve had to go and walk about at night when
he wouldnt let me stay in the room but hes sorry for it
afterwards And he hangs about after me he waits for me in the
street and I dont think he ought to because I ve always been a
good wife to him And I tell him Mrs Barthwick wouldnt like him
coming about the place But that only makes him angry and he says
dreadful things about the gentry Of course it was through me that
he first lost his place through his not treating me right and
thats made him bitter against the gentry He had a very good place
as groom in the country but it made such a stir because of course
he did nt treat me right

MARLOW Got the sack

MRS JONES Yes his employer said he couldnt keep him because
there was a great deal of talk and he said it was such a bad
example But its very important for me to keep my work here I
have the three children and I dont want him to come about after me
in the streets and make a disturbance as he sometimes does

MARLOW Holding up the empty decanter Not a drain Next time
he hits you get a witness and go down to the court

MRS JONES Yes I think I ve made up my mind I think I ought
to

MARLOW Thats right Wheres the ciga

 He searches for the silver box he looks at MRS JONES who is
 sweeping on her hands and knees he checks himself and stands
 reflecting From the tray he picks two halfsmoked cigarettes
 and reads the name on them

Nestorwhere the deuce

 With a meditative air he looks again at MRS JONES and
 taking up JACKS overcoat he searches in the pockets
 WHEELER with a tray of breakfast things comes in

MARLOW Aside to WHEELER Have you seen the cigarettebox

WHEELER No

MARLOW Well its gone I put it on the tray last night And
hes been smoking Showing her the ends of cigarettes Its not
in these pockets He cant have taken it upstairs this morning
Have a good look in his room when he comes down Whos been in
here

WHEELER Only me and Mrs Jones

MRS JONES I ve finished here shall I do the drawingroom now

WHEELER Looking at her doubtfully Have you seenBetter do
the boudwower first

 MRS JONES goes out with pan and brush MARLOW and WHEELER
 look each other in the face

MARLOW Itll turn up

WHEELER Hesitating You dont think she
Nodding at the door

MARLOW Stoutly I dontI never believes anything of
anybody

WHEELER But the masterll have to be told

MARLOW You wait a bit and see if it dont turn up Suspicions
no business of ours I set my mind against it


 The curtain falls




 The curtain rises again at once



SCENE III

 BARTHWICK and MRS BARTHWICK are seated at the breakfast table
 He is a man between fifty and sixty quietly important with a
 bald forehead and pincenez and the Times in his hand She
 is a lady of nearly fifty well dressed with greyish hair
 good features and a decided manner They face each other

BARTHWICK From behind his paper The Labour man has got in at
the byelection for Barnside my dear

MRS BARTHWICK Another Labour I cant think what on earth the
country is about

BARTHWICK I predicted it Its not a matter of vast importance

MRS BARTHWICK Not How can you take it so calmly John To me
its simply outrageous And there you sit you Liberals and
pretend to encourage these people

BARTHWICK Frowning The representation of all parties is
necessary for any proper reform for any proper social policy

MRS BARTHWICK Ive no patience with your talk of reformall that
nonsense about social policy We know perfectly well what it is
they want they want things for themselves Those Socialists and
Labour men are an absolutely selfish set of people They have no
sense of patriotism like the upper classes they simply want what
weve got

BARTHWICK Want what weve got He stares into space My dear
what are you talking about With a contortion I m no alarmist

MRS BARTHWICK Cream Quite uneducated men Wait until they
begin to tax our investments I m convinced that when they once
get a chance they will tax everythingthey ve no feeling for the
country You Liberals and Conservatives you re all alike you
dont see an inch before your noses Youve no imagination not a
scrap of imagination between you You ought to join hands and nip
it in the bud

BARTHWICK You re talking nonsense How is it possible for
Liberals and Conservatives to join hands as you call it That
shows how absurd it is for womenWhy the very essence of a
Liberal is to trust in the people

MRS BARTHWICK Now John eat your breakfast As if there were
any real difference between you and the Conservatives All the
upper classes have the same interests to protect and the same
principles Calmly Oh youre sitting upon a volcano John

BARTHWICK What

MRS BARTHWICK I read a letter in the paper yesterday I forget
the mans name but it made the whole thing perfectly clear You
dont look things in the face

BARTHWICK Indeed Heavily I am a Liberal Drop the subject
please

MRS BARTHWICK Toast I quite agree with what this man says
Education is simply ruining the lower classes It unsettles them
and thats the worst thing for us all I see an enormous difference
in the manner of servants

BARTHWICK With suspicious emphasis I welcome any change that
will lead to something better He opens a letter Hm This is
that affair of Master Jacks again High Street Oxford Sir We
have received Mr John Barthwick Seniors draft for forty pounds
Oh the letters to him We now enclose the cheque you cashed with
us which as we stated in our previous letter was not met on
presentation at your bank We are Sir yours obediently Moss and
Sons Tailors H m Staring at the cheque A pretty business
altogether The boy might have been prosecuted

MRS BARTHWICK Come John you know Jack did nt mean anything he
only thought he was overdrawing I still think his bank ought to
have cashed that cheque They must know your position

BARTHWICK Replacing in the envelope the letter and the cheque
Much good that would have done him in a court of law

 He stops as JACK comes in fastening his waistcoat and
 staunching a razor cut upon his chin

JACK Sitting down between them and speaking with an artificial
joviality Sorry I m late He looks lugubriously at the
dishes Tea please mother Any letters for me BARTHWICK
hands the letter to him But look here I say this has been
opened I do wish you would nt

BARTHWICK Touching the envelope I suppose I m entitled to
this name

JACK Sulkily Well I cant help having your name father He
reads the letter and mutters Brutes

BARTHWICK Eyeing him You dont deserve to be so well out of
that

JACK Havent you ragged me enough dad

MRS BARTHWICK Yes John let Jack have his breakfast

BARTHWICK If you hadnt had me to come to where would you have
been Its the merest accidentsuppose you had been the son of a
poor man or a clerk Obtaining money with a cheque you knew your
bank could not meet It might have ruined you for life I cant
see whats to become of you if these are your principles I never
did anything of the sort myself

JACK I expect you always had lots of money If youve got plenty
of money of course

BARTHWICK On the contrary I had not your advantages My father
kept me very short of money

JACK How much had you dad

BARTHWICK Its not material The question is do you feel the
gravity of what you did

JACK I dont know about the gravity Of course I m very sorry
if you think it was wrong Have nt I said so I should never have
done it at all if I had nt been so jolly hard up

BARTHWICK How much of that forty pounds have you got left Jack

JACK Hesitating I dont knownot much

BARTHWICK How much

JACK Desperately I have nt got any

BARTHWICK What

JACK I know I ve got the most beastly headache

 He leans his head on his hand

MRS BARTHWICK Headache My dear boy Cant you eat any
breakfast

JACK Drawing in his breath Too jolly bad

MRS BARTHWICK Im so sorry Come with me dear Ill give you
something that will take it away at once

 They leave the room and BARTHWICK tearing up the letter
 goes to the fireplace and puts the pieces in the fire While
 he is doing this MARLOW comes in and looking round him is
 about quietly to withdraw

BARTHWICK Whats that What d you want

MARLOW I was looking for Mr John sir

BARTHWICK What d you want Mr John for

MARLOW With hesitation I thought I should find him here sir

BARTHWICK Suspiciously Yes but what do you want him for

MARLOW Offhandedly Theres a lady calledasked to speak to
him for a minute sir

BARTHWICK A lady at this time in the morning What sort of a
lady

MARLOW Without expression in his voice I cant tell sir no
particular sort She might be after charity She might be a Sister
of Mercy I should think sir

BARTHWICK Is she dressed like one

MARLOW No sir shes in plain clothes sir

BARTHWICK Did nt she say what she wanted

MARLOW No sir

BARTHWICK Where did you leave her

MARLOW In the hall sir

BARTHWICK In the hall How do you know shes not a thiefnot got
designs on the house

MARLOW No sir I dont fancy so sir

BARTHWICK Well show her in here Ill see her myself

 MARLOW goes out with a private gesture of dismay He soon
 returns ushering in a young pale lady with dark eyes and
 pretty figure in a modish black but rather shabby dress a
 black and white trimmed hat with a bunch of Parma violets
 wrongly placed and fuzzyspotted veil At the Sight of MR
 BARTHWICK she exhibits every sign of nervousness MARLOW goes
 out

BARTHWICK Ask Mr John to come down

 MARLOW goes out and BARTHWICK walks uneasily about

 He glances at this unknown lady who stands with eyes cast
 down twisting her hands And suddenly Jack appears He stops
 on seeing who is here and the unknown lady hysterically
 giggles There is a silence

BARTHWICK Portentously This youngerlady says that last

UNKNOWN Impulsively My reticule and all my money was in a
crimson silk purse

JACK Reticule Looking round for any chance to get away I
dont know anything about it

BARTHWICK Sharply Come do you deny seeing this young lady

JACK Smiling pallidly Im awfully sorry If theres anything

BARTHWICK Do You can restore this property I suppose

JACK Ill go and have a look but I really dont think I ve got
it

 He goes out hurriedly And BARTHWICK placing a chair
 motions to the visitor to sit then with pursed lips he
 stands and eyes her fixedly She sits and steals a look at
 him then turns away and drawing up her veil stealthily
 wipes her eyes And Jack comes back

JACK Ruefully holding out the empty reticule Is that the
thing I ve looked all overI cant find the purse anywhere Are
you sure it was there

UNKNOWN Tearfully Sure Of course Im sure A crimson silk
purse It was all the money I had

JACK Clasping his head But I cant give you what I have nt

UNKNOWN Tearing at her handkerchief Oh do give it me She
puts her hands together in appeal then with sudden fierceness
If you dont Ill summons you Its stealing thats what it is

BARTHWICK Uneasily One moment please As a matter ofer
principle I shall settle this claim He produces money Here is
eight pounds the extra will cover the value of the purse and your
cab fares I need make no commentno thanks are necessary

 Touching the bell he holds the door ajar in silence The
 unknown lady stores the money in her reticule she looks from
 JACK to BARTHWICK and her face is quivering faintly with a
 smile She hides it with her hand and steals away Behind
 her BARTHWICK shuts the door

BARTHWICK With solemnity Hm This is nice thing to happen

JACK Impersonally What awful luck

BARTHWICK So this is the way that forty pounds has gone One
thing after another Once more I should like to know where you d
have been if it had nt been for me You dont seem to have any
principles Youyoure one of those who are a nuisance to society
youyoure dangerous What your mother would say I dont know
Your conduct as far as I can see is absolutely unjustifiable
Itsits criminal Why a poor man who behaved as youve done
d you think hed have any mercy shown him What you want is a good
lesson You and your sort arehe speaks with feelinga nuisance
to the community Dont ask me to help you next time Youre not
fit to be helped

JACK Turning upon his sire with unexpected fierceness All

helped me this time I know if you had nt been scared the thing
would get into the papers Where are the cigarettes

BARTHWICK Regarding him uneasily Well I ll say no more about
it He rings the bell I ll pass it over for this once but
MARLOW Comes in You can clear away

 He hides his face behind the Times

JACK Brightening I say Marlow where are the cigarettes

MARLOW I put the box out with the whisky last night sir but this
morning I cant find it anywhere

JACK Did you look in my room

MARLOW Yes sir Ive looked all over the house I found two
Nestor ends in the tray this morning so you must have been smokin
last night sir Hesitating I m really afraid some ones
purloined the box

JACK Uneasily Stolen it

BARTHWICK Whats that The cigarettebox Is anything else
missing

MARLOW No sir I ve been through the plate

BARTHWICK Was the house all right this morning None of the
windows open

MARLOW No sir Quietly to JACK You left your latchkey in
the door last night sir

 He hands it back unseen by BARTHWICK

JACK Tst

BARTHWICK Whos been in the room this morning

MARLOW Me and Wheeler and Mrs Jones is all sir as far as I
know

BARTHWICK Have you asked Mrs Barthwick

To JACK Go and ask your mother if shes had it ask her to look
and see if shes missed anything else

 JACK goes upon this mission

Nothing is more disquieting than losing things like this

MARLOW No sir

BARTHWICK Have you any suspicions

MARLOW No sir

BARTHWICK This Mrs Joneshow long has she been working here

MARLOW Only this last month sir

BARTHWICK What sort of person

MARLOW I dont know much about her sir seems a very quiet
respectable woman

BARTHWICK Who did the room this morning

MARLOW Wheeler and Mrs Jones Sir

BARTHWICK With his forefinger upraised Now was this Mrs
Jones in the room alone at any time

MARLOW Expressionless Yes Sir

BARTHWICK How do you know that

MARLOW Reluctantly I found her here sir

BARTHWICK And has Wheeler been in the room alone

MARLOW No sir shes not sir I should say sir that Mrs
Jones seems a very honest

BARTHWICK Holding up his hand I want to know this Has this
Mrs Jones been here the whole morning

MARLOW Yes sirno sirshe stepped over to the greengrocers
for cook

BARTHWICK Hm Is she in the house now

MARLOW Yes Sir

BARTHWICK Very good I shall make a point of clearing this up
On principle I shall make a point of fixing the responsibility it
goes to the foundations of security In all your interests

MARLOW Yes Sir

BARTHWICK What sort of circumstances is this Mrs Jones in Is
her husband in work

MARLOW I believe not sir

BARTHWICK Very well Say nothing about it to any one Tell
Wheeler not to speak of it and ask Mrs Jones to step up here

MARLOW Very good sir

 MARLOW goes out his face concerned and BARTHWICK stays his
 face judicial and a little pleased as befits a man conducting
 an inquiry MRS BARTHWICK and hey son come in

BARTHWICK Well my dear youve not seen it I suppose

MRS BARTHWICK No But what an extraordinary thing John
Marlow of course is out of the question I m certain none of the
maids as for cook

BARTHWICK Oh cook

MRS BARTHWICK Of course Its perfectly detestable to me to
suspect anybody

BARTHWICK It is not a question of ones feelings Its a question
of justice On principle

MRS BARTHWICK I should nt be a bit surprised if the charwoman
knew something about it It was Laura who recommended her

BARTHWICK Judicially I am going to have Mrs Jones up Leave
it to me anderremember that nobody is guilty until theyre
proved so I shall be careful I have no intention of frightening
her I shall give her every chance I hear shes in poor
circumstances If we are not able to do much for them we are bound
to have the greatest sympathy with the poor MRS JONES comes in
Pleasantly Oh good morning Mrs Jones

MRS JONES Soft and even unemphatic Good morning sir Good

MRS JONES No sir hes not earning anything just now sir

sir A little silence

BARTHWICK And how old is the eldest

MRS JONES Nine years old sir

BARTHWICK Do they go to school

MRS JONES Yes sir they all three go to school every day

BARTHWICK Severely And what about their food when youre out
at work

MRS JONES Well Sir I have to give them their dinner to take
with them Of course I m not always able to give them anything
sometimes I have to send them without but my husband is very good
about the children when hes in work But when hes not in work of
course hes a very difficult man

BARTHWICK He drinks I suppose

MRS JONES Yes Sir Of course I cant say he does nt drink
because he does

BARTHWICK And I suppose he takes all your money

MRS JONES No sir hes very good about my money except when

BARTHWICK Now what is heyour husband

MRS JONES By profession sir of course hes a groom

BARTHWICK A groom How came he to lose his place

MRS JONES He lost his place a long time ago sir and hes never
had a very long job since and now of course the motorcars are
against him

BARTHWICK When were you married to him Mrs Jones

MRS JONES Eight years ago sir that was in

MRS BARTHWICK Sharply Eight You said the eldest child was
nine

MRS JONES Yes maam of course that was why he lost his place
He did nt treat me rightly and of course his employer said he
couldnt keep him because of the example

BARTHWICK You mean heahem

MRS JONES Yes sir and of course after he lost his place he
married me

MRS BARTHWICK You actually mean to say youyou were

MRS JONES Well Sir I have a day in Stamford Place Thursdays
And Mondays and Wednesdays and Fridays I come here But today of
course is a halfday because of yesterdays Bank Holiday

BARTHWICK I see four days a week and you get half a crown a day
is that it

MRS JONES Yes sir and my dinner but sometimes its only half
a day and thats eighteen pence

BARTHWICK And when your husband earns anything he spends it in
drink I suppose

MRS JONES Sometimes he does sir and sometimes he gives it to me
for the children Of course he would work if he could get it sir
but it seems there are a great many people out of work

BARTHWICK Ah Yes Weerwont go into that
Sympathetically And how about your work here Do you find it
hard

MRS JONES Oh no sir not very hard sir except of course
when I dont get my sleep at night

BARTHWICK Ah And you help do all the rooms And sometimes I
suppose you go out for cook

MRS JONES Yes Sir

BARTHWICK And you ve been out this morning

MRS JONES Yes sir of course I had to go to the greengrocers

BARTHWICK Exactly So your husband earns nothing And hes a bad
character

MRS JONES No Sir I dont say that sir I think theres a
great deal of good in him though he does treat me very bad
sometimes And of course I dont like to leave him but I think I
ought to because really I hardly know how to stay with him He
often raises his hand to me Not long ago he gave me a blow here
touches her breast and I can feel it now So I think I ought to
leave him dont you sir

BARTHWICK Ah I cant help you there Its a very serious thing
to leave your husband Very serious thing

MRS JONES Yes sir of course I m afraid of what he might do to
me if I were to leave him he can be so very violent

BARTHWICK Hm Well that I cant pretend to say anything about
Its the bad principle Im speaking of

MRS JONES Yes Sir I know nobody can help me I know I must
decide for myself and of course I know that he has a very hard
life And hes fond of the children and its very hard for him to
see them going without food

BARTHWICK Hastily Wellerthank you I just wanted to hear
about you I dont think I need detain you any longer Mrs Jones

MRS JONES No sir thank you sir

BARTHWICK Good morning then

MRS JONES Good morning sir good morning maam

BARTHWICK Exchanging glances with his wife By the way Mrs
JonesI think it is only fair to tell you a silver cigarettebox
eris missing

MRS JONES Looking from one face to the other I am very sorry
sir

BARTHWICK Yes you have not seen it I suppose

MRS JONES Realising that suspicion is upon her with an uneasy
movement Where was it sir if you please sir

BARTHWICK Evasively Where did Marlow say Erin this room
yes in this room

MRS JONES No Sir I have nt seen itof course if I d seen it
I should have noticed it

BARTHWICK Giving hey a rapid glance Youyou are sure of that

MRS JONES Impassively Yes Sir With a slow nodding of her
head I have not seen it and of course I dont know where it is

 She turns and goes quietly out

BARTHWICK Hm

 The three BARTHWICKS avoid each others glances


 The curtain falls

SCENE I

 The JONESs lodgings Merthyr Street at halfpast two oclock

 There is a knock and MRS SEDDON the landlady appears an
 anxious harassed shabby woman in working clothes

MRS SEDDON I thought I eard you come in Mrs Jones I ve

JONES With scowling jocularity Never you mind what your
usband says you go your own way like a proper independent woman
Here jenny chuck her that

 Producing a sovereign from his trousers pocket he throws it
 to his wife who catches it in her apron with a gasp JONES
 resumes the lacing of his boots

MRS JONES Rubbing the sovereign stealthily Im very sorry

 MRS SEDDON takes the sovereign and fumbles for the change

 A silence

And you treat me so badly James going after that Rosie and all
You dont ever seem to think of the children that I ve had to bring

 He puts the purse back in his pocket

MRS JONES Of course it would have been better for them poor

JONES Sullenly An you aint the only one If I make money
out thereLooking up he sees her shaking out his coatin a
changed voice Leave that coat alone

 The silver box drops from the pocket scattering the
 cigarettes upon the bed Taking up the box she stares at it
 he rushes at her and snatches the box away

 The curtain falls




SCENE II

 The BARTHWICKS diningroom the same evening The BARTHWICKS
 are seated at dessert

MRS BARTHWICK John A silence broken by the cracking of nuts
John

BARTHWICK I wish youd speak about the nuts theyre uneatable
He puts one in his mouth

MRS BARTHWICK Its not the season for them I called on the
Holyroods

 BARTHWICK fills his glass with port

JACK Crackers please Dad

 BARTHWICK passes the crackers His demeanour is reflective

MRS BARTHWICK Lady Holyrood has got very stout I ve noticed it
coming for a long time

BARTHWICK Gloomily Stout He takes up the crackerswith
transparent airiness The Holyroods had some trouble with their
servants had nt they

JACK Crackers please Dad

BARTHWICK Passing the crackers It got into the papers The
cook was nt it

MRS BARTHWICK No the ladys maid I was talking it over with
Lady Holyrood The girl used to have her young man to see her

BARTHWICK Uneasily Im not sure they were wise

MRS BARTHWICK My dear John what are you talking about How
could there be any alternative Think of the effect on the other
servants

BARTHWICK Of course in principleI wasnt thinking of that

JACK Maliciously Crackers please Dad

 BARTHWICK is compelled to pass the crackers

MRS BARTHWICK Lady Holyrood told me I had her up she said I
said to her Youll leave my house at once I think your conduct
disgraceful I cant tell I dont know and I dont wish to know
what you were doing I send you away on principle you need not
come to me for a character And the girl said If you dont give
me my notice my lady I want a months wages Im perfectly
respectable Ive done nothingDone nothing

BARTHWICK Hm

MRS BARTHWICK Servants have too much license They hang together
so terribly you never can tell what theyre really thinking its as
if they were all in a conspiracy to keep you in the dark Even with
Marlow you feel that he never lets you know whats really in his
mind I hate that secretiveness it destroys all confidence I
feel sometimes I should like to shake him

JACK Marlows a most decent chap Its simply beastly every one
knowing your affairs

BARTHWICK The less you say about that the better

MRS BARTHWICK It goes all through the lower classes You can not
tell when they are speaking the truth Today when I was shopping
after leaving the Holyroods one of these unemployed came up and
spoke to me I suppose I only had twenty yards or so to walk to the
carnage but he seemed to spring up in the street

BARTHWICK Ah You must be very careful whom you speak to in these
days

MRS BARTHWICK I did nt answer him of course But I could see
at once that he wasnt telling the truth

BARTHWICK Cracking a nut Theres one very good rulelook at
their eyes

JACK Crackers please Dad

BARTHWICK Passing the crackers If their eyes are
straightforward I sometimes give them sixpence It s against my
principles but its most difficult to refuse If you see that
theyre desperate and dull and shiftylooking as so many of them
are its certain to mean drink or crime or something
unsatisfactory

MRS BARTHWICK This man had dreadful eyes He looked as if he
could commit a murder I ve ad nothing to eat today he said
Just like that

BARTHWICK What was William about He ought to have been waiting

JACK Raising his wineglass to his nose Is this the 63 Dad

 BARTHWICK holding his wineglass to his eye lowers it and
 passes it before his nose

MRS BARTHWICK I hate people that cant speak the truth Father
and son exchange a look behind their port It s just as easy to
speak the truth as not Ive always found it easy enough It makes
it impossible to tell what is genuine one feels as if one were
continually being taken in

BARTHWICK Sententiously The lower classes are their own
enemies If they would only trust us they would get on so much
better

MRS BARTHWICK But even then its so often their own fault Look
at that Mrs Jones this morning

BARTHWICK I only want to do whats right in that matter I had
occasion to see Roper this afternoon I mentioned it to him Hes
coming in this evening It all depends on what the detective says
Ive had my doubts Ive been thinking it over

MRS BARTHWICK The woman impressed me most unfavourably She
seemed to have no shame That affair she was talking aboutshe and
the man when they were young so immoral And before you and Jack
I could have put her out of the room

BARTHWICK Oh I dont want to excuse them but in looking at
these matters one must consider

MRS BARTHWICK Perhaps youll say the mans employer was wrong in
dismissing him

BARTHWICK Of course not Its not there that I feel doubt What
I ask myself is

JACK Port please Dad

BARTHWICK Circulating the decanter in religious imitation of the
rising and setting of the sun I ask myself whether we are
sufficiently careful in making inquiries about people before we
engage them especially as regards moral conduct

JACK Pass theport please Mother

MRS BARTHWICK Passing it My dear boy are nt you drinking
too much

 JACK fills his glass

MARLOW Entering Detective Snow to see you Sir

BARTHWICK Uneasily Ah say Ill be with him in a minute

MRS BARTHWICK Without turning Let him come in here Marlow

 SNOW enters in an overcoat his bowler hat in hand

BARTHWICK Halfrising Oh Good evening

SNOW Good evening sir good evening maam I ve called round to
report what I ve done rather late I m afraidanother case took
me away He takes the silver box out o f his pocket causing a
sensation in the BARTHWICK family This is the identical article
I believe

BARTHWICK Certainly certainly

SNOW Havin your crest and cypher as you described to me sir I
d no hesitation in the matter

BARTHWICK Excellent Will you have a glass of he glances at the
waning portersherrypours out sherry Jack just give Mr
Snow this

 JACK rises and gives the glass to SNOW then lolling in his
 chair regards him indolently

SNOW Drinking off wine and putting down the glass After seeing
you I went round to this womans lodgings sir Its a low
neighborhood and I thought it as well to place a constable below
and not without e was wanted as things turned out

BARTHWICK Indeed

SNOW Yes Sir I ad some trouble I asked her to account for the
presence of the article She could give me no answer except to
deny the theft so I took her into custody then her husband came
for me so I was obliged to take him too for assault He was very
violent on the way to the stationvery violentthreatened you and
your son and altogether he was a handful I can till you

MRS BARTHWICK What a ruffian he must be

SNOW Yes maam a rough customer

JACK Sipping his mine bemused Punch the beggars head

SNOW Given to drink as I understand sir

MRS BARTHWICK Its to be hoped he will get a severe punishment

SNOW The odd thing is sir that he persists in sayin he took the
box himself

BARTHWICK Took the box himself He smiles What does he think
to gain by that

SNOW He says the young gentleman was intoxicated last night

 JACK stops the cracking of a nut and looks at SNOW

 BARTHWICK losing his smile has put his wineglass down
 there is a silenceSNOW looking from face to face remarks

took him into the house and gave him whisky and under the
influence of an empty stomach the man says he took the box

MRS BARTHWICK The impudent wretch

BARTHWICK D you mean that heerintends to put this forward
tomorrow

SNOW Thatll be his line sir but whether hes endeavouring to
shield his wife or whether he looks at JACK theres something in
it will be for the magistrate to say

MRS BARTHWICK Haughtily Something in what I dont
understand you As if my son would bring a man like that into the
house

BARTHWICK From the fireplace with an effort to be calm My son
can speak for himself no doubt Well Jack what do you say

MRS BARTHWICK Sharply What does he say Why of course he
says the whole storys stuff

JACK Embarrassed Well of course Iof course I dont know
anything about it

MRS BARTHWICK I should think not indeed To Snow The man is
an audacious ruffian

BARTHWICK Suppressing jumps But in view of my sons saying
theres nothing in thisthis fablewill it be necessary to proceed
against the man under the circumstances

SNOW We shall have to charge him with the assault sir It would
be as well for your son to come down to the Court Therell be a
remand no doubt The queer thing is there was quite a sum of money
found on him and a crimson silk purse

 BARTHWICK starts JACK rises and sits dozen again

I suppose the lady has nt missed her purse

BARTHWICK Hastily Oh no Oh No

JACK No

MRS BARTHWICK Dreamily No To SNOW I ve been inquiring
of the servants This man does hang about the house I shall feel
much safer if he gets a good long sentence I do think we ought to
be protected against such ruffians

BARTHWICK Yes yes of course on principle but in this case we
have a number of things to think of To SNOW I suppose as you
say the man must be charged eh

SNOW No question about that sir

BARTHWICK Staring gloomily at JACK This prosecution goes very
much against the grain with me I have great sympathy with the
poor In my position I m bound to recognise the distress there is
amongst them The condition of the people leaves much to be
desired D you follow me I wish I could see my way to drop it

MRS BARTHWICK Sharply John its simply not fair to other
people Its putting property at the mercy of any one who likes to
take it

BARTHWICK Trying to make signs to her aside I m not defending
him not at all Im trying to look at the matter broadly

MRS BARTHWICK Nonsense John theres a time for everything

SNOW Rather sardonically I might point out sir that to
withdraw the charge of stealing would not make much difference
because the facts must come out he looks significantly at JACK in
reference to the assault and as I said that charge will have to go
forward

BARTHWICK Hastily Yes oh exactly Its entirely on the
womans accountentirely a matter of my own private feelings

SNOW If I were you sir I should let things take their course
Its not likely therell be much difficulty These things are very
quick settled

BARTHWICK Doubtfully You think soyou think so

JACK Rousing himself I say what shall I have to swear to

SNOW Thats best known to yourself sir Retreating to the
door Better employ a solicitor sir in case anything should
arise We shall have the butler to prove the loss of the article
Youll excuse me going I m rather pressed tonight The case may
come on any time after eleven Good evening sir good evening
maam I shall have to produce the box in court tomorrow so if
youll excuse me sir I may as well take it with me

 He takes the silver box and leaves them with a little bow

 BARTHWICK makes a move to follow him then dashing his hands
 beneath his coat tails speaks with desperation

BARTHWICK I do wish youd leave me to manage things myself You
will put your nose into matters you know nothing of A pretty mess
youve made of this

MRS BARTHWICK Coldly I dont in the least know what youre
talking about If you cant stand up for your rights I can I ve
no patience with your principles its such nonsense

BARTHWICK Principles Good Heavens What have principles to do
with it for goodness sake Dont you know that Jack was drunk last
night

JACK Dad

MRS BARTHWICK In horror rising Jack

JACK Look here MotherI had supper Everybody does I mean to
sayyou know what I meanits absurd to call it being drunk At
Oxford everybody gets a bit on sometimes

MRS BARTHWICK Well I think its most dreadful If that is
really what you do at Oxford

JACK Angrily Well why did you send me there One must do as
other fellows do Its such nonsense I mean to call it being
drunk Of course I m awfully sorry I ve had such a beastly
headache all day

BARTHWICK Tcha If youd only had the common decency to remember
what happened when you came in Then we should know what truth
there was in what this fellow saysas it is its all the most
confounded darkness

JACK Staring as though at halfformed visions I just get a
and thenit s gone

MRS BARTHWICK Oh Jack do you mean to say you were so tipsy you
cant even remember

JACK Look here Mother Of course I remember I cameI must have
come

BARTHWICK Unguardedly and walking up and down Tchaand that
infernal purse Good Heavens Itll get into the papers Who on
earth could have foreseen a thing like this Better to have lost a
dozen cigaretteboxes and said nothing about it To his wife
Its all your doing I told you so from the first I wish to
goodness Roper would come

MRS BARTHWICK Sharply I dont know what youre talking about
John

BARTHWICK Turning on her No youyouyou dont know
anything Sharply Where the devil is Roper If he can see a
way out of this hes a better man than I take him for I defy any
one to see a way out of it I cant

JACK Look here dont excite DadI can simply say I was too
beastly tired and dont remember anything except that I came in and
in a dying voice went to bed the same as usual

BARTHWICK Went to bed Who knows where you wentI ve lost all
confidence For all I know you slept on the floor

JACK Indignantly I did nt I slept on the

BARTHWICK Sitting on the sofa Who cares where you slept what
does it matter if he mentions thethea perfect disgrace

MRS BARTHWICK What A silence I insist on knowing

JACK Oh nothing

MRS BARTHWICK Nothing What do you mean by nothing Jack
Theres your father in such a state about it

JACK Its only my purse

MRS BARTHWICK Your purse You know perfectly well you have nt
got one

JACK Well it was somebody elsesit was all a jokeI did nt
want the beastly thing

MRS BARTHWICK Do you mean that you had another persons purse
and that this man took it too

BARTHWICK Tcha Of course he took it too A man like that Jones
will make the most of it Itll get into the papers

MRS BARTHWICK I dont understand What on earth is all the fuss
about Bending over JACK and softly Jack now tell me dear
Dont be afraid What is it Come

JACK Oh dont Mother

and rising voice a woman

JACK Jumping up You would have it I did nt want to tell

 The door opens and MARLOW ushers in a man of middle age
 inclined to corpulence in evening dress He has a ruddy thin
 moustache and dark quickmoving little eyes His eyebrows
 aye Chinese

 MRS BARTHWICK recoils from him

father to his mother

MRS BARTHWICK Turning quickly Goodnight my boy

JACK Goodnight Mother

 He goes out MRS BARTHWICK heaves a sigh There is a
 silence

BARTHWICK He gets off too easily But for my money that woman

ROPER Therell be a remand

BARTHWICK What D you mean hell have to appear on the remand

ROPER Yes

BARTHWICK Hm I thought youd be able toLook here Roper

 ROPER fixes his little eyes on him and nods

MRS BARTHWICK Mr Roper dont you think the magistrate ought to
be told what sort of people these Joness are I mean about their
immorality before they were married I dont know if John told you

ROPER Afraid its not material

MRS BARTHWICK Not material

ROPER Purely private life May have happened to the magistrate

BARTHWICK With a movement as if to shift a burden Then youll
take the thing into your hands

ROPER If the gods are kind He holds his hand out

BARTHWICK Shaking it dubiously Kind eh What You going

ROPER Yes Ive another case something like yoursmost
unexpected

 He bows to MRS BARTHWICK and goes out followed by
 BARTHWICK talking to the last MRS BARTHWICK at the table
 bursts into smothered sobs BARTHWICK returns

BARTHWICK To himself Therell be a scandal

MRS BARTHWICK Disguising her grief at once I simply cant
imagine what Roper means by making a joke of a thing like that

BARTHWICK Staring strangely You You cant imagine anything
Youve no more imagination than a fly

MRS BARTHWICK Angrily You dare to tell me that I have no
imagination

BARTHWICK Flustered II m upset From beginning to end the
whole thing has been utterly against my principles

MRS BARTHWICK Rubbish You have nt any Your principles are
nothing in the world but sheer fright

BARTHWICK Walking to the window Ive never been frightened in
my life You heard what Roper said Its enough to upset one when
a thing like this happens Everything one says and does seems to
turn in ones mouthitsits uncanny Its not the sort of thing
Ive been accustomed to As though stifling he throws the window
open The faint sobbing of a child comes in Whats that

 They listen

MRS BARTHWICK Sharply I cant stand that crying I must send
Marlow to stop it My nerves are all on edge She rings the
bell

BARTHWICK Ill shut the window youll hear nothing He shuts
the window There is silence

MRS BARTHWICK Sharply Thats no good Its on my nerves
Nothing upsets me like a childs crying

 MARLOW comes in

Whats that noise of crying Marlow It sounds like a child

BARTHWICK It is a child I can see it against the railings

MARLOW Opening the window and looking out quietly Its Mrs
Joness little boy maam he came here after his mother

MRS BARTHWICK Moving quickly to the window Poor little chap
John we ought nt to go on with this

BARTHWICK Sitting heavily in a chair Ah but its out of our
hands

 MRS BARTHWICK turns her back to the window There is an
 expression of distress on hey face She stands motionless
 compressing her lips The crying begins again BARTHWICK
 coveys his ears with his hands and MARLOW shuts the window
 The crying ceases


 The curtain falls

under the influence of the whisky he had taken the box

SNOW I did sir

MAGISTRATE Hissing with protruded neck Nowyou will have
your chance of saying what you want to say presently Have you
anything to ask the officer

JONES Sullenly No

MAGISTRATE Very well then Now let us hear what the female
prisoner has to say first

MRS JONES Well your Worship of course I can only say what I ve
said all along that I did nt take the box

MAGISTRATE Yes but did you know that it was taken

MRS JONES No your Worship And of course to what my husband
says your Worship I cant speak of my own knowledge Of course I
know that he came home very late on the Monday night It was past
one oclock when he came in and he was not himself at all

MAGISTRATE Had he been drinking

MRS JONES Yes your Worship

MAGISTRATE And was he drunk

MRS JONES Yes your Worship he was almost quite drunk

MAGISTRATE And did he say anything to you

MRS JONES No your Worship only to call me names And of course
in the morning when I got up and went to work he was asleep And I
dont know anything more about it until I came home again Except
that Mr BARTHWICKthat s my employer your Worshiptold me the
box was missing

MAGISTRATE Yes yes

MRS JONES But of course when I was shaking out my husbands coat
the cigarettebox fell out and all the cigarettes were scattered on
the bed

To SNOW Did you see the cigarettes scattered on the bed

SNOW No your Worship I did not

MAGISTRATE You see he says he did nt see them

JONES Well they were there for all that

SNOW I cant say your Worship that I had the opportunity of
going round the room I had all my work cut out with the male
prisoner

MAGISTRATE To MRS JONES Well what more have you to say

MRS JONES Of course when I saw the box your Worship I was
dreadfully upset and I could nt think why he had done such a
thing when the officer came we were having words about it because
it is ruin to me your Worship in my profession and I have three
little children dependent on me

MAGISTRATE Protruding his neck Yesyesbut what did he say
to you

MRS JONES I asked him whatever came over him to do such a thing
and he said it was the drink He said he had had too much to drink
and something came over him And of course your Worship he had
had very little to eat all day and the drink does go to the head
when you have not had enough to eat Your Worship may not know but
it is the truth And I would like to say that all through his
married life I have never known him to do such a thing before
though we have passed through great hardships and speaking with
soft emphasis I am quite sure he would not have done it if he had
been himself at the time

MAGISTRATE Yes yes But dont you know that that is no excuse

MRS JONES Yes your Worship I know that it is no excuse

 The MAGISTRATE leans over and parleys with his CLERK

JACK Leaning over from his seat behind I say Dad

BARTHWICK Tsst Sheltering his mouth he speaks to ROPER
Roper you had better get up now and say that considering the
circumstances and the poverty of the prisoners we have no wish to
proceed any further and if the magistrate would deal with the case
as one of disorder only on the part of

BALD CONSTABLE HSSShh

 ROPER shakes his head

MAGISTRATE Now supposing what you say and what your husband says
is true what I have to consider ishow did he obtain access to
this house and were you in any way a party to his obtaining access
You are the charwoman employed at the house

MRS JONES Yes your Worship and of course if I had let him into
the house it would have been very wrong of me and I have never done
such a thing in any of the houses where I have been employed

MAGISTRATE Wellso you say Now let us hear what story the male
prisoner makes of it

JONES Who leans with his arms on the dock behind speaks in a
slow sullen voice Wot I say is wot my wife says I ve never
been ad up in a police court before an I can prove I took it when
in liquor I told her and she can tell you the same that I was
goin to throw the thing into the water sooner then ave it on my

ROPER And is that all you can remember about your coming in

JACK In a loud voice Yes it is

MAGISTRATE Now you have heard the male prisoners story what do

straightforward voice The fact of the matter is sir that I d

came in late

MAGISTRATE Do you remember this man being outside when you came
in

JACK No Sir He hesitates I dont think I do

MAGISTRATE Somewhat puzzled Well did he help you to open the

MAGISTRATE Smiling Oh youd had too much champagne

JONES May I ask the gentleman a question

JONES Well I do an my words as good as yours I ve never
been had up in a police court before Look ere dont you remember

ROPER I submit to your worship that these questions are hardly to
the point the prisoner having admitted that he himself does not
remember anything There is a smile on the face of Justice It
is a case of the blind leading the blind

JONES Violently Ive done no more than wot he as Im a poor
man Ive got no money an no friendshe s a toffhe can do wot I
cant

MAGISTRATE Now now All this wont help youyou must be quiet
You say you took this box Now what made you take it Were you

JONES Im always pressed for money

MAGISTRATE Was that the reason you took it

JONES No

MAGISTRATE To SNOW Was anything found on him

SNOW Yes your worship There was six pounds twelve shillins
found on him and this purse

 The red silk purse is handed to the MAGISTRATE BARTHWICK
 rises his seat but hastily sits down again

MAGISTRATE Staring at the purse Yes yeslet me see There is
a silence No no I ve nothing before me as to the purse How
did you come by all that money

JONES After a long pause suddenly I declines to say

MAGISTRATE But if you had all that money what made you take this
box

JONES I took it out of spite

MAGISTRATE Hissing with protruded neck You took it out of
spite Well now thats something But do you imagine you can go
about the town taking things out of spite

JONES If you had my life if youd been out of work

MAGISTRATE Yes yes I knowbecause youre out of work you think
its an excuse for everything

JONES Pointing at JACK You ask im wot made im take the

ROPER Quietly Does your Worship require this witness in the
box any longer

MAGISTRATE Ironically I think not he is hardly profitable

 JACK leaves the witnessbox and hanging his head resumes his
 seat

JONES You ask im wot made im take the ladys

 But the BALD CONSTABLE catches him by the sleeve

BALD CONSTABLE SSSh

MAGISTRATE Emphatically Now listen to me

I ve nothing to do with what he may or may not have taken Why did
you resist the police in the execution of their duty

JONES It war nt their duty to take my wife a respectable woman
that ad nt done nothing

MAGISTRATE But I say it was What made you strike the officer a
blow

JONES Any man would a struck im a blow Id strike im again I

MAGISTRATE You are not making your case any better by violence
How do you suppose we could get on if everybody behaved like you

JONES Leaning forward earnestly Well wot about er whos

MRS JONES Your Worship its the children thats preying on his
mind because of course I ve lost my work And Ive had to find
another room owing to the scandal

MAGISTRATE Yes yes I knowbut if he had nt acted like this
nobody would have suffered

JONES Glaring round at JACK I ve done no worse than wot e
as Wot I want to know is wot s goin to be done to im

 The BALD CONSTABLE again says HSSh

ROPER Mr BARTHWICK wishes it known your Worship that
considering the poverty of the prisoners he does not press the
charge as to the box Perhaps your Worship would deal with the case
as one of disorder

JONES I dont want it smothered up I want it all dealt with fair
I want my rights

MAGISTRATE Rapping his desk Now you have said all you have to
say and you will be quiet

 There is a silence the MAGISTRATE bends over and parleys with
 his CLERK

Yes I think I may discharge the woman In a kindly voice he
addresses MRS JONES who stands unmoving with her hands crossed on
the rail It is very unfortunate for you that this man has behaved
as he has It is not the consequences to him but the consequences
to you You have been brought here twice you have lost your work
He glares at JONESand this is what always happens Now you may
go away and I am very sorry it was necessary to bring you here at
all

MRS JONES Softly Thank you very much your Worship

 She leaves the dock and looking back at JONES twists her
 fingers and is still

MAGISTRATE Yes yes but I cant pass it over Go away theres a
good woman

 MRS JONES stands back The MAGISTRATE leans his head on his
 hand then raising it he speaks to JONES

Now listen to me Do you wish the case to be settled here or do
you wish it to go before a jury

JONES Muttering I dont want no jury

MAGISTRATE Very well then I will deal with it here After a
pause You have pleaded guilty to stealing this box

JONES Not to stealin

BALD CONSTABLE HSSShh

MAGISTRATE And to assaulting the police

JONES Any man as was a man

MAGISTRATE Your conduct here has been most improper You give the
excuse that you were drunk when you stole the box I tell you that
is no excuse If you choose to get drunk and break the law
afterwards you must take the consequences And let me tell you that
men like you who get drunk and give way to your spite or whatever
it is thats in you arearea nuisance to the community

JACK Leaning from his seat Dad thats what you said to me

BARTHWICK TSSt

 There is a silence while the MAGISTRATE consults his CLERK
 JONES leans forward waiting

MAGISTRATE This is your first offence and I am going to give you
a light sentence Speaking sharply but without expression One
month with hard labour
