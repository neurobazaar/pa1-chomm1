REGINALD


I did itI who should have known better I persuaded Reginald to go to
the McKillops gardenparty against his will

We all make mistakes occasionally

They know youre here and theyll think it so funny if you dont go
And I want particularly to be in with Mrs McKillop just now

I know you want one of her smoke Persian kittens as a prospective wife
for Wumplesor a husband is it Reginald has a magnificent scorn for
details other than sartorial And I am expected to undergo social
martyrdom to suit the connubial exigencies

Reginald Its nothing of the kind only Im sure Mrs McKillop Would
be pleased if I brought you Young men of your brilliant attractions are
rather at a premium at her gardenparties

Should be at a premium in heaven remarked Reginald complacently

There will be very few of you there if that is what you mean But
seriously there wont be any great strain upon your powers of endurance
I promise you that you shant have to play croquet or talk to the
Archdeacons wife or do anything that is likely to bring on physical
prostration You can just wear your sweetest clothes and moderately
amiable expression and eat chocolatecreams with the appetite of a
_blase_ parrot Nothing more is demanded of you

Reginald shut his eyes There will be the exhaustingly uptodate young
women who will ask me if I have seen _San Toy_ a less progressive grade
who will yearn to hear about the Diamond Jubileethe historic event not
the horse With a little encouragement they will inquire if I saw the
Allies march into Paris Why are women so fond of raking up the past
Theyre as bad as tailors who invariably remember what you owe them for
a suit long after youve ceased to wear it

Ill order lunch for one oclock that will give you two and a half
hours to dress in

Reginald puckered his brow into a tortured frown and I knew that my
point was gained He was debating what tie would go with which
waistcoat

Even then I had my misgivings

    

During the drive to the McKillops Reginald was possessed with a great
peace which was not wholly to be accounted for by the fact that he had
inveigled his feet into shoes a size too small for them I misgave more
than ever and having once launched Reginald on to the McKillops lawn I
established him near a seductive dish of _marrons glaces_ and as far
from the Archdeacons wife as possible as I drifted away to a diplomatic
distance I heard with painful distinctness the eldest Mawkby girl asking
him if he had seen _San Toy_

It must have been ten minutes later not more and I had been having
_quite_ an enjoyable chat with my hostess and had promised to lend her
_The Eternal City_ and my recipe for rabbit mayonnaise and was just
about to offer a kind home for her third Persian kitten when I
perceived out of the corner of my eye that Reginald was not where I had
left him and that the _marrons glaces_ were untasted At the same
moment I became aware that old Colonel Mendoza was essaying to tell his
classic story of how he introduced golf into India and that Reginald was
in dangerous proximity There are occasions when Reginald is caviare to
the Colonel

When I was at Poona in 76

My dear Colonel purred Reginald fancy admitting such a thing Such
a giveaway for ones age I wouldnt admit being on this planet in
76 Reginald in his wildest lapses into veracity never admits to
being more than twentytwo

The Colonel went to the colour of a fig that has attained great ripeness
and Reginald ignoring my efforts to intercept him glided away to
another part of the lawn I found him a few minutes later happily
engaged in teaching the youngest Rampage boy the approved theory of
mixing absinthe within full earshot of his mother Mrs Rampage
occupies a prominent place in local Temperance movements

As soon as I had broken up this unpromising _teteatete_ and settled
Reginald where he could watch the croquet players losing their tempers I
wandered off to find my hostess and renew the kitten negotiations at the
point where they had been interrupted I did not succeed in running her
down at once and eventually it was Mrs McKillop who sought me out and
her conversation was not of kittens

Your cousin is discussing _Zaza_ with the Archdeacons wife at least
he is discussing she is ordering her carriage

She spoke in the dry staccato tone of one who repeats a French exercise
and I knew that as far as Millie McKillop was concerned Wumples was
devoted to a lifelong celibacy

If you dont mind I said hurriedly I think wed like our carriage
ordered too and I made a forced march in the direction of the croquet
ground

I found everyone talking nervously and feverishly of the weather and the
war in South Africa except Reginald who was reclining in a comfortable
chair with the dreamy faraway look that a volcano might wear just after
it had desolated entire villages The Archdeacons wife was buttoning up
her gloves with a concentrated deliberation that was fearful to behold I
shall have to treble my subscription to her Cheerful Sunday Evenings Fund
before I dare set foot in her house again

At that particular moment the croquet players finished their game which
had been going on without a symptom of finality during the whole
afternoon Why I ask should it have stopped precisely when a counter
attraction was so necessary Everyone seemed to drift towards the area
of disturbance of which the chairs of the Archdeacons wife and Reginald
formed the stormcentre Conversation flagged and there settled upon
the company that expectant hush that precedes the dawnwhen your
neighbours dont happen to keep poultry

What did the Caspian Sea asked Reginald with appalling suddenness

There were symptoms of a stampede The Archdeacons wife looked at me
Kipling or someone has described somewhere the look a foundered camel
gives when the caravan moves on and leaves it to its fate The
peptonised reproach in the good ladys eyes brought the passage vividly
to my mind

I played my last card

Reginald its getting late and a seamist is coming on I knew that
the elaborate curl over his right eyebrow was not guaranteed to survive a
seamist

    

Never never again will I take you to a gardenparty Never    You
behaved abominably    What did the Caspian see

A shade of genuine regret for misused opportunities passed over
Reginalds face

After all he said I believe an apricot tie would have gone better
with the lilac waistcoat




REGINALD ON CHRISTMAS PRESENTS


I wish it to be distinctly understood said Reginald that I dont want a
George Prince of Wales Prayerbook as a Christmas present The fact
cannot be too widely known

There ought he continued to be technical education classes on the
science of presentgiving No one seems to have the faintest notion of
what anyone else wants and the prevalent ideas on the subject are not
creditable to a civilised community

There is for instance the female relative in the country who knows a
tie is always useful and sends you some spotted horror that you could
only wear in secret or in Tottenham Court Road It _might_ have been
useful had she kept it to tie up currant bushes with when it would have
served the double purpose of supporting the branches and frightening away
the birdsfor it is an admitted fact that the ordinary tomtit of
commerce has a sounder aesthetic taste than the average female relative
in the country

Then there are aunts They are always a difficult class to deal with in
the matter of presents The trouble is that one never catches them
really young enough By the time one has educated them to an
appreciation of the fact that one does not wear red woollen mittens in
the West End they die or quarrel with the family or do something
equally inconsiderate That is why the supply of trained aunts is always
so precarious

There is my Aunt Agatha _par exemple_ who sent me a pair of gloves last
Christmas and even got so far as to choose a kind that was being worn
and had the correct number of buttons But_they were nines_ I sent
them to a boy whom I hated intimately he didnt wear them of course
but he could havethat was where the bitterness of death came in It
was nearly as consoling as sending white flowers to his funeral Of
course I wrote and told my aunt that they were the one thing that had
been wanting to make existence blossom like a rose I am afraid she
thought me frivolousshe comes from the North where they live in the
fear of Heaven and the Earl of Durham Reginald affects an exhaustive
knowledge of things political which furnishes an excellent excuse for
not discussing them Aunts with a dash of foreign extraction in them
are the most satisfactory in the way of understanding these things but
if you cant choose your aunt it is wisest in the longrun to choose the
present and send her the bill

Even friends of ones own set who might be expected to know better have
curious delusions on the subject I am _not_ collecting copies of the
cheaper editions of Omar Khayyam I gave the last four that I received
to the liftboy and I like to think of him reading them with
FitzGeralds notes to his aged mother Liftboys always have aged
mothers shows such nice feeling on their part I think

Personally I cant see where the difficulty in choosing suitable
presents lies No boy who had brought himself up properly could fail to
appreciate one of those decorative bottles of liqueurs that are so
reverently staged in Morels windowand it wouldnt in the least matter
if one did get duplicates And there would always be the supreme moment
of dreadful uncertainty whether it was _creme de menthe_ or
Chartreuselike the expectant thrill on seeing your partners hand
turned up at bridge People may say what they like about the decay of
Christianity the religious system that produced green Chartreuse can
never really die

And then of course there are liqueur glasses and crystallised fruits
and tapestry curtains and heaps of other necessaries of life that make
really sensible presentsnot to speak of luxuries such as having ones
bills paid or getting something quite sweet in the way of jewellery
Unlike the alleged Good Woman of the Bible Im not above rubies When
found by the way she must have been rather a problem at Christmastime
nothing short of a blank cheque would have fitted the situation Perhaps
its as well that shes died out

The great charm about me concluded Reginald is that I am so easily
pleased But I draw the line at a Prince of Wales Prayerbook




REGINALD ON THE ACADEMY


One goes to the Academy in selfdefence said Reginald It is the one
topic one has in common with the Country Cousins

It is almost a religious observance with them said the Other A kind
of artistic Mecca and when the good ones die they go

To the Chantrey Bequest The mystery is _what_ they find to talk about
in the country

There are two subjects of conversation in the country Servants and Can
fowls be made to pay The first I believe is compulsory the second
optional

As a function resumed Reginald the Academy is a failure

You think it would be tolerable without the pictures

The pictures are all right in their way after all one can always
_look_ at them if one is bored with ones surroundings or wants to avoid
an imminent acquaintance

Even that doesnt always save one There is the inevitable female whom
you met once in Devonshire or the Matoppo Hills or somewhere who
charges up to you with the remark that its funny how one always meets
people one knows at the Academy Personally I _dont_ think it funny

I suffered in that way just now said Reginald plaintively from a
woman whose word I had to take that she had met me last summer in
Brittany

I hope you were not too brutal

I merely told her with engaging simplicity that the art of life was the
avoidance of the unattainable

Did she try and work it out on the back of her catalogue

Not there and then She murmured something about being so clever
Fancy coming to the Academy to be clever

To be clever in the afternoon argues that one is dining nowhere in the
evening

Which reminds me that I cant remember whether I accepted an invitation
from you to dine at Kettners tonight

On the other hand I can remember with startling distinctness not having
asked you to

So much certainty is unbecoming in the young so well consider that
settled What were you talking about Oh pictures Personally I
rather like them they are so refreshingly real and probable they take
one away from the unrealities of life

One likes to escape from oneself occasionally

That is the disadvantage of a portrait as a rule ones bitterest
friends can find nothing more to ask than the faithful unlikeness that
goes down to posterity as oneself I hate posterityits so fond of
having the last word Of course as regards portraits there are
exceptions

For instance

To die before being painted by Sargent is to go to heaven prematurely

With the necessary care and impatience you may avoid that catastrophe

If youre going to be rude said Reginald I shall dine with you to
morrow night as well The chief vice of the Academy he continued is
its nomenclature Why for instance should an obvious troutstream with
a palpable rabbit sitting in the foreground be called an evening dream
of unbeclouded peace or something of that sort

You think said the Other that a name should economise description
rather than stimulate imagination

Properly chosen it should do both There is my lady kitten at home
for instance Ive called it Derry

Suggests nothing to my imagination but protracted sieges and religious
animosities Of course I dont know your kitten

Oh youre silly Its a sweet name and it answers to itwhen it
wants to Then if there are any unseemly noises in the night they can
be explained succinctly Derry and Toms

You might almost charge for the advertisement But as applied to
pictures dont you think your system would be too subtle say for the
Country Cousins

Every reformation must have its victims You cant expect the fatted
calf to share the enthusiasm of the angels over the prodigals return
Another darling weakness of the Academy is that none of its luminaries
must arrive in a hurry You can see them coming for years like a
Balkan trouble or a street improvement and by the time they have painted
a thousand or so square yards of canvas their work begins to be
recognised

Someone who Must Not be Contradicted said that a man must be a success
by the time hes thirty or never

To have reached thirty said Reginald is to have failed in life




REGINALD AT THE THEATRE


After all said the Duchess vaguely there are certain things you
cant get away from Right and wrong good conduct and moral rectitude
have certain welldefined limits

So for the matter of that replied Reginald has the Russian Empire
The trouble is that the limits are not always in the same place

Reginald and the Duchess regarded each other with mutual distrust
tempered by a scientific interest Reginald considered that the Duchess
had much to learn in particular not to hurry out of the Carlton as
though afraid of losing ones last bus A woman he said who is
careless of disappearances is capable of leaving town before Goodwood
and dying at the wrong moment of an unfashionable disease

The Duchess thought that Reginald did not exceed the ethical standard
which circumstances demanded

Of course she resumed combatively its the prevailing fashion to
believe in perpetual change and mutability and all that sort of thing
and to say we are all merely an improved form of primeval apeof course
you subscribe to that doctrine

I think it decidedly premature in most people I know the process is far
from complete

And equally of course you are quite irreligious

Oh by no means The fashion just now is a Roman Catholic frame of mind
with an Agnostic conscience you get the mediaeval picturesqueness of the
one with the modern conveniences of the other

The Duchess suppressed a sniff She was one of those people who regard
the Church of England with patronising affection as if it were something
that had grown up in their kitchen garden

But there are other things she continued which I suppose are to a
certain extent sacred even to you Patriotism for instance and Empire
and Imperial responsibility and bloodisthickerthanwater and all
that sort of thing

Reginald waited for a couple of minutes before replying while the Lord
of Rimini temporarily monopolised the acoustic possibilities of the
theatre

That is the worst of a tragedy he observed one cant always hear
oneself talk Of course I accept the Imperial idea and the
responsibility After all I would just as soon think in Continents as
anywhere else And some day when the season is over and we have the
time you shall explain to me the exact bloodbrotherhood and all that
sort of thing that exists between a French Canadian and a mild Hindoo and
a Yorkshireman for instance

Oh well dominion over palm and pine you know quoted the Duchess
hopefully of course we mustnt forget that were all part of the great
AngloSaxon Empire

Which for its part is rapidly becoming a suburb of Jerusalem A very
pleasant suburb I admit and quite a charming Jerusalem But still a
suburb

Really to be told ones living in a suburb when one is conscious of
spreading the benefits of civilisation all over the world PhilanthropyI
suppose you will say _that_ is a comfortable delusion and yet even you
must admit that whenever want or misery or starvation is known to exist
however distant or difficult of access we instantly organise relief on
the most generous scale and distribute it if need be to the uttermost
ends of the earth

The Duchess paused with a sense of ultimate triumph She had made the
same observation at a drawingroom meeting and it had been extremely
well received

I wonder said Reginald if you have ever walked down the Embankment
on a winter night

Gracious no child Why do you ask

I didnt I only wondered And even your philanthropy practised in a
world where everything is based on competition must have a debit as well
as a credit account The young ravens cry for food

And are fed

Exactly Which presupposes that something else is fed upon

Oh youre simply exasperating Youve been reading Nietzsche till you
havent got any sense of moral proportion left May I ask if you are
governed by _any_ laws of conduct whatever

There are certain fixed rules that one observes for ones own comfort
For instance never be flippantly rude to any inoffensive greybearded
stranger that you may meet in pine forests or hotel smokingrooms on the
Continent It always turns out to be the King of Sweden

The restraint must be dreadfully irksome to you When I was younger
boys of your age used to be nice and innocent

Now we are only nice One must specialise in these days Which reminds
me of the man I read of in some sacred book who was given a choice of
what he most desired And because he didnt ask for titles and honours
and dignities but only for immense wealth these other things came to
him also

I am sure you didnt read about him in any sacred book

Yes I fancy you will find him in Debrett




REGINALDS PEACE POEM


Im writing a poem on Peace said Reginald emerging from a sweeping
operation through a tin of mixed biscuits in whose depths a macaroon or
two might yet be lurking

Something of the kind seems to have been attempted already said the
Other

Oh I know but I may never have the chance again Besides Ive got a
new fountain pen I dont pretend to have gone on any very original
lines in writing about Peace the thing is to say what everybody else is
saying only to say it better It begins with the usual ornithological
emotion

 When the widgeon westward winging
 Heard the folk Vereeniginging
 Heard the shouting and the singing

Vereeniginging is good but why widgeon

Why not Anything that winged westward would naturally begin with a
_w_

Need it wing westward

The bird must go somewhere You wouldnt have it hang around and look
foolish Then Ive brought in something about the heedless hartebeest
galloping over the deserted veldt

Of course you know its practically extinct in those regions

I cant help _that_ it gallops so nicely I make it have all sorts of
unexpected yearnings

 Mother may I go and maffick
 Tear around and hinder traffic

Of course youll say there would be no traffic worth bothering about on
the bare and sunscorched veldt but theres no other word that rhymes
with maffick

Seraphic

Reginald considered It might do but Ive got a lot about angels later
on You must have angels in a Peace poem I know dreadfully little about
their habits

They can do unexpected things like the hartebeest

Of course Then I turn on London the City of Dreadful Nocturnes
resonant with hymns of joy and thanksgiving

 And the sleeper eye unlidding
 Heard a voice for ever bidding
 Much farewell to Dolly Gray
 Turning weary on his truckle
 Bed he heard the honeysuckle
 Lauded in apiarian lay

Longfellow at his best wrote nothing like that

I agree with you

I wish you wouldnt Ive a sweet temper but I cant stand being
agreed with And Im so worried about the aasvogel

Reginald stared dismally at the biscuittin which now presented an
unattractive array of rejected cracknels

I believe he murmured if I could find a woman with an unsatisfied
craving for cracknels I should marry her

What is the tragedy of the aasvogel asked the Other sympathetically

Oh simply that theres no rhyme for it I thought about it all the
time I was dressingits dreadfully bad for one to think whilst ones
dressingand all lunchtime and Im still hung up over it I feel like
those unfortunate automobilists who achieve an unenviable motoriety by
coming to a hopeless stop with their cars in the most crowded
thoroughfares Im afraid I shall have to drop the aasvogel and it did
give such lovely local colour to the thing

Still youve got the heedless hartebeest

And quite a decorative bit of moral admonitionwhen youve worried the
meaning out

 Cease War thy bubbling madness that the wine shares
 And bid thy legions turn their swords to mine shares

Mine shares seems to fit the case better than ploughshares Theres lots
more about the blessings of Peace shall I go on reading it

If I must make a choice I think I would rather they went on with the
war




REGINALDS CHOIR TREAT


Never wrote Reginald to his most darling friend be a pioneer Its
the Early Christian that gets the fattest lion

Reginald in his way was a pioneer

None of the rest of his family had anything approaching Titian hair or a
sense of humour and they used primroses as a table decoration

It follows that they never understood Reginald who came down late to
breakfast and nibbled toast and said disrespectful things about the
universe The family ate porridge and believed in everything even the
weather forecast

Therefore the family was relieved when the vicars daughter undertook the
reformation of Reginald Her name was Amabel it was the vicars one
extravagance Amabel was accounted a beauty and intellectually gifted
she never played tennis and was reputed to have read Maeterlincks _Life
of the Bee_ If you abstain from tennis _and_ read Maeterlinck in a
small country village you are of necessity intellectual Also she had
been twice to Fecamp to pick up a good French accent from the Americans
staying there consequently she had a knowledge of the world which might
be considered useful in dealings with a worldling

Hence the congratulations in the family when Amabel undertook the
reformation of its wayward member

Amabel commenced operations by asking her unsuspecting pupil to tea in
the vicarage garden she believed in the healthy influence of natural
surroundings never having been in Sicily where things are different

And like every woman who has ever preached repentance to unregenerate
youth she dwelt on the sin of an empty life which always seems so much
more scandalous in the country where people rise early to see if a new
strawberry has happened during the night

Reginald recalled the lilies of the field which simply sat and looked
beautiful and defied competition

But that is not an example for us to follow gasped Amabel

Unfortunately we cant afford to You dont know what a world of
trouble I take in trying to rival the lilies in their artistic
simplicity

You are really indecently vain of your appearance A good life is
infinitely preferable to good looks

You agree with me that the two are incompatible I always say beauty is
only sin deep

Amabel began to realise that the battle is not always to the
strongminded With the immemorial resource of her sex she abandoned
the frontal attack and laid stress on her unassisted labours in parish
work her mental loneliness her discouragementsand at the right moment
she produced strawberries and cream Reginald was obviously affected by
the latter and when his preceptress suggested that he might begin the
strenuous life by helping her to supervise the annual outing of the
bucolic infants who composed the local choir his eyes shone with the
dangerous enthusiasm of a convert

Reginald entered on the strenuous life alone as far as Amabel was
concerned The most virtuous women are not proof against damp grass and
Amabel kept her bed with a cold Reginald called it a dispensation it
had been the dream of his life to stagemanage a choir outing With
strategic insight he led his shy bulletheaded charges to the nearest
woodland stream and allowed them to bathe then he seated himself on
their discarded garments and discoursed on their immediate future which
he decreed was to embrace a Bacchanalian procession through the village
Forethought had provided the occasion with a supply of tin whistles but
the introduction of a hegoat from a neighbouring orchard was a brilliant
afterthought Properly Reginald explained there should have been an
outfit of panther skins as it was those who had spotted handkerchiefs
were allowed to wear them which they did with thankfulness Reginald
recognised the impossibility in the time at his disposal of teaching
his shivering neophytes a chant in honour of Bacchus so he started them
off with a more familiar if less appropriate temperance hymn After
all he said it is the spirit of the thing that counts Following the
etiquette of dramatic authors on first nights he remained discreetly in
the background while the procession with extreme diffidence and the
goat wound its way lugubriously towards the village The singing had
died down long before the main street was reached but the miserable
wailing of pipes brought the inhabitants to their doors Reginald said
he had seen something like it in pictures the villagers had seen nothing
like it in their lives and remarked as much freely

Reginalds family never forgave him They had no sense of humour




REGINALD ON WORRIES


I have said Reginald an aunt who worries Shes not really an aunta
sort of amateur one and they arent really worries She is a social
success and has no domestic tragedies worth speaking of so she adopts
any decorative sorrows that are going myself included In that way
shes the antithesis or whatever you call it to those sweet
uncomplaining women one knows who have seen trouble and worn blinkers
ever since Of course one just loves them for it but I must confess
they make me uncomfy they remind one so of a duck that goes flapping
about with forced cheerfulness long after its heads been cut off Ducks
have _no_ repose Now my aunt has a shade of hair that suits her and a
cook who quarrels with the other servants which is always a hopeful
sign and a conscience thats absentee for about eleven months of the
year and only turns up at Lent to annoy her husbands people who are
considerably Lower than the angels so to speak with all these natural
advantagesshe says her particular tint of bronze is a natural
advantage and there can be no two opinions as to the advantageof
course she has to send out for her afflictions like those restaurants
where they havent got a licence The system has this advantage that
you can fit your unhappinesses in with your other engagements whereas
real worries have a way of arriving at mealtimes and when youre
dressing or other solemn moments I knew a canary once that had been
trying for months and years to hatch out a family and everyone looked
upon it as a blameless infatuation like the sale of Delagoa Bay which
would be an annual loss to the Press agencies if it ever came to pass
and one day the bird really did bring it off in the middle of family
prayers I say the middle but it was also the end you cant go on
being thankful for daily bread when you are wondering what on earth very
new canaries expect to be fed on

At present shes rather in a Balkan state of mind about the treatment of
the Jews in Roumania Personally I think the Jews have estimable
qualities theyre so kind to their poorand to our rich I daresay in
Roumania the cost of living beyond ones income isnt so great Over
here the trouble is that so many people who have money to throw about
seem to have such vague ideas where to throw it That fund for
instance to relieve the victims of sudden disasterswhat is a sudden
disaster Theres Marion Mulciber who _would_ think she could play
bridge just as she would think she could ride down a hill on a bicycle
on that occasion she went to a hospital now shes gone into a
Sisterhoodlost all she had you know and gave the rest to Heaven
Still you cant call it a sudden calamity _that_ occurred when poor
dear Marion was born The doctors said at the time that she couldnt
live more than a fortnight and shes been trying ever since to see if
she could Women are so opinionated

And then theres the Education Questionnot that I can see that theres
anything to worry about in that direction To my mind education is an
absurdly overrated affair At least one never took it very seriously
at school where everything was done to bring it prominently under ones
notice Anything that is worth knowing one practically teaches oneself
and the rest obtrudes itself sooner or later The reason ones elders
know so comparatively little is because they have to unlearn so much that
they acquired by way of education before we were born Of course Im a
believer in Naturestudy as I said to Lady Beauwhistle if you want a
lesson in elaborate artificiality just watch the studied unconcern of a
Persian cat entering a crowded salon and then go and practise it for a
fortnight The Beauwhistles werent born in the Purple you know but
theyre getting there on the instalment systemso much down and the
rest when you feel like it They have kind hearts and they never forget
birthdays I forget what he was something in the City where the
patriotism comes from and sheoh well her frocks are built in Paris
but she wears them with a strong English accent So publicspirited of
her I think she must have been very strictly brought up shes so
desperately anxious to do the wrong thing correctly Not that it really
matters nowadays as I told her I know some perfectly virtuous people
who are received everywhere




REGINALD ON HOUSEPARTIES


The drawback is one never really _knows_ ones hosts and hostesses One
gets to know their foxterriers and their chrysanthemums and whether the
story about the gocart can be turned loose in the drawingroom or must
be told privately to each member of the party for fear of shocking
public opinion but ones host and hostess are a sort of human hinterland
that one never has the time to explore

There was a fellow I stayed with once in Warwickshire who farmed his own
land but was otherwise quite steady Should never have suspected him of
having a soul yet not very long afterwards he eloped with a liontamers
widow and set up as a golfinstructor somewhere on the Persian Gulf
dreadfully immoral of course because he was only an indifferent player
but still it showed imagination His wife was really to be pitied
because he had been the only person in the house who understood how to
manage the cooks temper and now she has to put DV on her dinner
invitations Still thats better than a domestic scandal a woman who
leaves her cook never wholly recovers her position in Society

I suppose the same thing holds good with the hosts they seldom have more
than a superficial acquaintance with their guests and so often just when
they do get to know you a bit better they leave off knowing you
altogether There was _rather_ a breath of winter in the air when I left
those Dorsetshire people You see they had asked me down to shoot and
Im not particularly immense at that sort of thing Theres such a
deadly sameness about partridges when youve missed one youve missed
the lotat least thats been my experience And they tried to rag me
in the smokingroom about not being able to hit a bird at five yards a
sort of bovine ragging that suggested cows buzzing round a gadfly and
thinking they were teasing it So I got up the next morning at early
dawnI know it was dawn because there were larknoises in the sky and
the grass looked as if it had been left out all nightand hunted up the
most conspicuous thing in the bird line that I could find and measured
the distance as nearly as it would let me and shot away all I knew
They said afterwards that it was a tame bird thats simply _silly_
because it was awfully wild at the first few shots Afterwards it
quieted down a bit and when its legs had stopped waving farewells to the
landscape I got a gardenerboy to drag it into the hall where everybody
must see it on their way to the breakfastroom I breakfasted upstairs
myself I gathered afterwards that the meal was tinged with a very
unchristian spirit I suppose its unlucky to bring peacocks feathers
into a house anyway there was a bluepencilly look in my hostesss eye
when I took my departure

Some hostesses of course will forgive anything even unto pavonicide
is there such a word as long as one is nicelooking and sufficiently
unusual to counterbalance some of the others and there _are_ othersthe
girl for instance who reads Meredith and appears at meals with
unnatural punctuality in a frock thats made at home and repented at
leisure She eventually finds her way to India and gets married and
comes home to admire the Royal Academy and to imagine that an
indifferent prawn curry is for ever an effective substitute for all that
we have been taught to believe is luncheon Its then that she is really
dangerous but at her worst she is never quite so bad as the woman who
fires _Exchange and Mart_ questions at you without the least provocation
Imagine the other day just when I was doing my best to understand half
the things I was saying being asked by one of those seekers after
country home truths how many fowls she could keep in a run ten feet by
six or whatever it was I told her whole crowds as long as she kept
the door shut and the idea didnt seem to have struck her before at
least she brooded over it for the rest of dinner

Of course as I say one never really _knows_ ones ground and one may
make mistakes occasionally But then ones mistakes sometimes turn out
assets in the longrun if we had never bungled away our American
colonies we might never have had the boy from the States to teach us how
to wear our hair and cut our clothes and we must get our ideas from
somewhere I suppose Even the Hooligan was probably invented in China
centuries before we thought of him England must wake up as the Duke of
Devonshire said the other day wasnt it Oh well it was someone else
Not that I ever indulge in despair about the Future there always have
been men who have gone about despairing of the Future and when the
Future arrives it says nice superior things about their having acted
according to their lights It is dreadful to think that other peoples
grandchildren may one day rise up and call one amiable

There are moments when one sympathises with Herod




REGINALD AT THE CARLTON


A most variable climate said the Duchess and how unfortunate that we
should have had that very cold weather at a time when coal was so dear
So distressing for the poor

Someone has observed that Providence is always on the side of the big
dividends remarked Reginald

The Duchess ate an anchovy in a shocked manner she was sufficiently old
fashioned to dislike irreverence towards dividends

Reginald had left the selection of a feedingground to her womanly
intuition but he chose the wine himself knowing that womanly intuition
stops short at claret A woman will cheerfully choose husbands for her
less attractive friends or take sides in a political controversy without
the least knowledge of the issues involvedbut no woman ever cheerfully
chose a claret

Hors doeuvres have always a pathetic interest for me said Reginald
they remind me of ones childhood that one goes through wondering what
the next course is going to be likeand during the rest of the menu one
wishes one had eaten more of the hors doeuvres Dont you love watching
the different ways people have of entering a restaurant There is the
woman who races in as though her whole scheme of life were held together
by a onepin despotism which might abdicate its functions at any moment
its really a relief to see her reach her chair in safety Then there
are the people who troop in with anunpleasantdutytoperform air as if
they were angels of Death entering a plague city You see that type of
Briton very much in hotels abroad And nowadays there are always the
Johannesbourgeois who bring a CapetoCairo atmosphere with themwhat
may be called the Rand Manner I suppose

Talking about hotels abroad said the Duchess I am preparing notes
for a lecture at the Club on the educational effects of modern travel
dealing chiefly with the moral side of the question I was talking to
Lady Beauwhistles aunt the other dayshes just come back from Paris
you know Such a sweet woman

And so silly In these days of the overeducation of women shes quite
refreshing They say some people went through the siege of Paris without
knowing that France and Germany were at war but the Beauwhistle aunt is
credited with having passed the whole winter in Paris under the
impression that the Humberts were a kind of bicycle    Isnt there a
bishop or somebody who believes we shall meet all the animals we have
known on earth in another world How frightfully embarrassing to meet a
whole shoal of whitebait you had last known at Princes Im sure in my
nervousness I should talk of nothing but lemons Still I daresay they
would be quite as offended if one hadnt eaten them I know if I were
served up at a cannibal feast I should be dreadfully annoyed if anyone
found fault with me for not being tender enough or having been kept too
long

My idea about the lecture resumed the Duchess hurriedly is to
inquire whether promiscuous Continental travel doesnt tend to weaken the
moral fibre of the social conscience There are people one knows quite
nice people when they are in England who are so _different_ when they
are anywhere the other side of the Channel

The people with what I call Tauchnitz morals observed Reginald On
the whole I think they get the best of two very desirable worlds And
after all they charge so much for excess luggage on some of those
foreign lines that its really an economy to leave ones reputation
behind one occasionally

A scandal my dear Reginald is as much to be avoided at Monaco or any
of those places as at Exeter let us say

Scandal my dear IreneI may call you Irene maynt I

I dont know that you have known me long enough for that

Ive known you longer than your godparents had when they took the
liberty of calling you that name Scandal is merely the compassionate
allowance which the gay make to the humdrum Think how many blameless
lives are brightened by the blazing indiscretions of other people Tell
me who is the woman with the old lace at the table on our left Oh
_that_ doesnt matter its quite the thing nowadays to stare at people
as if they were yearlings at Tattersalls

Mrs Spelvexit Quite a charming woman separated from her husband

Incompatibility of income

Oh nothing of that sort By miles of frozen ocean I was going to say
He explores icefloes and studies the movements of herrings and has
written a most interesting book on the homelife of the Esquimaux but
naturally he has very little homelife of his own

A husband who comes home with the Gulf Stream _would_ be rather a tied
up asset

His wife is exceedingly sensible about it She collects postagestamps
Such a resource Those people with her are the Whimples very old
acquaintances of mine theyre always having trouble poor things

Trouble is not one of those fancies you can take up and drop at any
moment its like a grousemoor or the opiumhabitonce you start it
youve got to keep it up

Their eldest son was such a disappointment to them they wanted him to
be a linguist and spent no end of money on having him taught to
speakoh dozens of languagesand then he became a Trappist monk And
the youngest who was intended for the American marriage market has
developed political tendencies and writes pamphlets about the housing of
the poor Of course its a most important question and I devote a good
deal of time to it myself in the mornings but as Laura Whimple says
its as well to have an establishment of ones own before agitating about
other peoples She feels it very keenly but she always maintains a
cheerful appetite which I think is so unselfish of her

There are different ways of taking disappointment There was a girl I
knew who nursed a wealthy uncle through a long illness borne by her with
Christian fortitude and then he died and left his money to a swinefever
hospital She found shed about cleared stock in fortitude by that time
and now she gives drawingroom recitations Thats what I call being
vindictive

Life is full of its disappointments observed the Duchess and I
suppose the art of being happy is to disguise them as illusions But
that my dear Reginald becomes more difficult as one grows older

I think its more generally practised than you imagine The young have
aspirations that never come to pass the old have reminiscences of what
never happened Its only the middleaged who are really conscious of
their limitationsthat is why one should be so patient with them But
one never is

After all said the Duchess the disillusions of life may depend on
our way of assessing it In the minds of those who come after us we may
be remembered for qualities and successes which we quite left out of the
reckoning

Its not always safe to depend on the commemorative tendencies of those
who come after us There may have been disillusionments in the lives of
the mediaeval saints but they would scarcely have been better pleased if
they could have foreseen that their names would be associated nowadays
chiefly with racehorses and the cheaper clarets And now if you can
tear yourself away from the salted almonds well go and have coffee
under the palms that are so necessary for our discomfort




REGINALD ON BESETTING SINS THE WOMAN WHO TOLD THE TRUTH


There was once said Reginald a woman who told the truth Not all at
once of course but the habit grew upon her gradually like lichen on an
apparently healthy tree She had no childrenotherwise it might have
been different It began with little things for no particular reason
except that her life was a rather empty one and it is so easy to slip
into the habit of telling the truth in little matters And then it
became difficult to draw the line at more important things until at last
she took to telling the truth about her age she said she was fortytwo
and five monthsby that time you see she was veracious even to months
It may have been pleasing to the angels but her elder sister was not
gratified On the Womans birthday instead of the operatickets which
she had hoped for her sister gave her a view of Jerusalem from the Mount
of Olives which is not quite the same thing The revenge of an elder
sister may be long in coming but like a SouthEastern express it
arrives in its own good time

The friends of the Woman tried to dissuade her from overindulgence in
the practice but she said she was wedded to the truth whereupon it was
remarked that it was scarcely logical to be so much together in public
No really provident woman lunches regularly with her husband if she
wishes to burst upon him as a revelation at dinner He must have time to
forget an afternoon is not enough And after a while her friends began
to thin out in patches Her passion for the truth was not compatible
with a large visitinglist For instance she told Miriam Klopstock
_exactly_ how she looked at the Ilexes ball Certainly Miriam had asked
for her candid opinion but the Woman prayed in church every Sunday for
peace in our time and it was not consistent

It was unfortunate everyone agreed that she had no family with a child
or two in the house there is an unconscious check upon too free an
indulgence in the truth Children are given us to discourage our better
emotions That is why the stage with all its efforts can never be as
artificial as life even in an Ibsen drama one must reveal to the
audience things that one would suppress before the children or servants

Fate may have ordained the truthtelling from the commencement and should
justly bear some of the blame but in having no children the Woman was
guilty at least of contributory negligence

Little by little she felt she was becoming a slave to what had once been
merely an idle propensity and one day she knew Every woman tells
ninety per cent of the truth to her dressmaker the other ten per cent
is the irreducible minimum of deception beyond which no selfrespecting
client trespasses Madame Dragas establishment was a meetingground for
naked truths and overdressed fictions and it was here the Woman felt
that she might make a final effort to recall the artless mendacity of
past days Madame herself was in an inspiring mood with the air of a
sphinx who knew all things and preferred to forget most of them As a
War Minister she might have been celebrated but she was content to be
merely rich

If I take it in here andMiss Howard one moment if you pleaseand
there and round like thissoI really think you will find it quite
easy

The Woman hesitated it seemed to require such a small effort to simply
acquiesce in Madames views But habit had become too strong Im
afraid she faltered its just the least little bit in the world too

And by that least little bit she measured the deeps and eternities of her
thraldom to fact Madame was not best pleased at being contradicted on a
professional matter and when Madame lost her temper you usually found it
afterwards in the bill

And at last the dreadful thing came as the Woman had foreseen all along
that it must it was one of those paltry little truths with which she
harried her waking hours On a raw Wednesday morning in a few
illchosen words she told the cook that she drank She remembered the
scene afterwards as vividly as though it had been painted in her mind by
Abbey The cook was a good cook as cooks go and as cooks go she went

Miriam Klopstock came to lunch the next day Women and elephants never
forget an injury




REGINALDS DRAMA


Reginald closed his eyes with the elaborate weariness of one who has
rather nice eyelashes and thinks it useless to conceal the fact

One of these days he said I shall write a really great drama No
one will understand the drift of it but everyone will go back to their
homes with a vague feeling of dissatisfaction with their lives and
surroundings Then they will put up new wallpapers and forget

But how about those that have oak panelling all over the house said
the Other

They can always put down new staircarpets pursued Reginald and
anyhow Im not responsible for the audience having a happy ending The
play would be quite sufficient strain on ones energies I should get a
bishop to say it was immoral and beautifulno dramatist has thought of
that before and everyone would come to condemn the bishop and they
would stay on out of sheer nervousness After all it requires a great
deal of moral courage to leave in a marked manner in the middle of the
second act when your carriage isnt ordered till twelve And it would
commence with wolves worrying something on a lonely wasteyou wouldnt
see them of course but you would hear them snarling and scrunching and
I should arrange to have a wolfy fragrance suggested across the
footlights It would look so well on the programmes Wolves in the
first act by Jamrach And old Lady Whortleberry who never misses a
first night would scream Shes always been nervous since she lost her
first husband He died quite abruptly while watching a county cricket
match two and a half inches of rain had fallen for seven runs and it
was supposed that the excitement killed him Anyhow it gave her quite a
shock it was the first husband shed lost you know and now she always
screams if anything thrilling happens too soon after dinner And after
the audience had heard the Whortleberry scream the thing would be fairly
launched

And the plot

The plot said Reginald would be one of those little everyday
tragedies that one sees going on all round one In my minds eye there
is the case of the MudgeJervises which in an unpretentious way has
quite an Enoch Arden intensity underlying it Theyd only been married
some eighteen months or so and circumstances had prevented their seeing
much of each other With him there was always a foursome or something
that had to be played and replayed in different parts of the country and
she went in for slumming quite as seriously as if it was a sport With
her I suppose it was She belonged to the Guild of the Poor Dear
Souls and they hold the record for having nearly reformed a washerwoman
No one has ever really reformed a washerwoman and that is why the
competition is so keen You can rescue charwomen by fifties with a
little tea and personal magnetism but with washerwomen its different
wages are too high This particular laundress who came from Bermondsey
or some such place was really rather a hopeful venture and they thought
at last that she might be safely put in the window as a specimen of
successful work So they had her paraded at a drawingroom At Home at
Agatha Camelfords it was sheer bad luck that some liqueur chocolates
had been turned loose by mistake among the refreshmentsreally liqueur
chocolates with very little chocolate And of course the old soul found
them out and cornered the entire stock It was like finding a whelk
stall in a desert as she afterwards partially expressed herself When
the liqueurs began to take effect she started to give them imitations of
farmyard animals as they know them in Bermondsey She began with a
dancing bear and you know Agatha doesnt approve of dancing except at
Buckingham Palace under proper supervision And then she got up on the
piano and gave them an organ monkey I gather she went in for realism
rather than a Maeterlinckian treatment of the subject Finally she fell
into the piano and said she was a parrot in a cage and for an impromptu
performance I believe she was very wordperfect no one had heard
anything like it except Baroness Boobelstein who has attended sittings
of the Austrian Reichsrath Agatha is trying the Restcure at Buxton

But the tragedy

Oh the MudgeJervises Well they were getting along quite happily
and their married life was one continuous exchange of picturepostcards
and then one day they were thrown together on some neutral ground where
foursomes and washerwomen overlapped and discovered that they were
hopelessly divided on the Fiscal Question They have thought it best to
separate and she is to have the custody of the Persian kittens for nine
months in the yearthey go back to him for the winter when she is
abroad There you have the material for a tragedy drawn straight from
lifeand the piece could be called The Price They Paid for Empire And
of course one would have to work in studies of the struggle of hereditary
tendency against environment and all that sort of thing The womans
father could have been an Envoy to some of the smaller German Courts
thats where shed get her passion for visiting the poor in spite of the
most careful upbringing _Cest le premier pa qui compte_ as the cuckoo
said when it swallowed its fosterparent That I think is quite
clever

And the wolves

Oh the wolves would be a sort of elusive undercurrent in the background
that would never be satisfactorily explained After all life teems with
things that have no earthly reason And whenever the characters could
think of nothing brilliant to say about marriage or the War Office they
could open a window and listen to the howling of the wolves But that
would be very seldom




REGINALD ON TARIFFS


Im not going to discuss the Fiscal Question said Reginald I wish to
be original At the same time I think one suffers more than one
realises from the system of free imports I should like for instance a
really prohibitive duty put upon the partner who declares on a weak red
suit and hopes for the best Even a free outlet for compressed verbiage
doesnt balance matters And I think there should be a sort of bounty
fed export is that the right expression of the people who impress on
you that you ought to take life seriously There are only two classes
that really cant help taking life seriouslyschoolgirls of thirteen and
Hohenzollerns they might be exempt Albanians come under another
heading they take life whenever they get the opportunity The one
Albanian that I was ever on speaking terms with was rather a decadent
example He was a Christian and a grocer and I dont fancy he had ever
killed anybody I didnt like to question him on the subjectthat
showed my delicacy Mrs Nicorax says I have no delicacy she hasnt
forgiven me about the mice You see when I was staying down there a
mouse used to cakewalk about my room half the night and none of their
silly patent traps seemed to take its fancy as a bijou residence so I
determined to appeal to the better side of itwhich with mice is the
inside So I called it Percy and put little delicacies down near its
hole every night and that kept it quiet while I read Max Nordaus
_Degeneration_ and other reproving literature and went to sleep And
now she says there is a whole colony of mice in that room

That isnt where the indelicacy comes in She went out riding with me
which was entirely her own suggestion and as we were coming home through
some meadows she made a quite unnecessary attempt to see if her pony
would jump a rather messy sort of brook that was there It wouldnt It
went with her as far as the waters edge and from that point Mrs
Nicorax went on alone Of course I had to fish her out from the bank
and my ridingbreeches are not cut with a view to salmonfishingits
rather an art even to ride in them Her habitskirt was one of those
open questions that need not be adhered to in emergencies and on this
occasion it remained behind in some waterweeds She wanted me to fish
about for that too but I felt I had done enough Pharaohs daughter
business for an October afternoon and I was beginning to want my tea So
I bundled her up on to her pony and gave her a lead towards home as fast
as I cared to go What with the wet and the unusual responsibility her
abridged costume did not stand the pace particularly well and she got
quite querulous when I shouted back that I had no pins with meand no
string Some women expect so much from a fellow When we got into the
drive she wanted to go up the back way to the stables but the ponies
_know_ they always get sugar at the front door and I never attempt to
hold a pulling pony as for Mrs Nicorax it took her all she knew to
keep a firm hand on her seceding garments which as her maid remarked
afterwards were more _tout_ than _ensemble_ Of course nearly the whole
houseparty were out on the lawn watching the sunsetthe only day this
month that its occurred to the sun to show itself as Mrs Nic
viciously observedand I shall never forget the expression on her
husbands face as we pulled up My darling this is too much was his
first spoken comment taking into consideration the state of her toilet
it was the most brilliant thing I had ever heard him say and I went into
the library to be alone and scream Mrs Nicorax says I have no
delicacy

Talking about tariffs the liftboy who reads extensively between the
landings says it wont do to tax raw commodities What exactly is a
raw commodity Mrs Van Challaby says men are raw commodities till you
marry them after theyve struck Mrs Van C I can fancy they pretty
soon become a finished article Certainly shes had a good deal of
experience to support her opinion She lost one husband in a railway
accident and mislaid another in the Divorce Court and the current one
has just got himself squeezed in a Beef Trust What was he doing in a
Beef Trust anyway she asked tearfully and I suggested that perhaps he
had an unhappy home I only said it for the sake of making conversation
which it did Mrs Van Challaby said things about me which in her calmer
moments she would have hesitated to spell Its a pity people cant
discuss fiscal matters without getting wild However she wrote next day
to ask if I could get her a Yorkshire terrier of the size and shade
thats being worn now and thats as near as a woman can be expected to
get to owning herself in the wrong And she will tie a salmonpink bow
to its collar and call it Reggie and take it with her everywherelike
poor Miriam Klopstock who _would_ take her Chow with her to the
bathroom and while she was bathing it was playing at shebears with her
garments Miriam is always late for breakfast and she wasnt really
missed till the middle of lunch

However Im not going any further into the Fiscal Question Only I
should like to be protected from the partner with a weak red tendency




REGINALDS CHRISTMAS REVEL


They say said Reginald that theres nothing sadder than victory except
defeat If youve ever stayed with dull people during what is alleged to
be the festive season you can probably revise that saying I shall
never forget putting in a Christmas at the Babwolds Mrs Babwold is
some relation of my fathersa sort of tobelefttillcalledfor
cousinand that was considered sufficient reason for my having to accept
her invitation at about the sixth time of asking though why the sins of
the father should be visited by the childrenyou wont find any
notepaper in that drawer thats where I keep old menus and firstnight
programmes

Mrs Babwold wears a rather solemn personality and has never been known
to smile even when saying disagreeable things to her friends or making
out the Stores list She takes her pleasures sadly A state elephant at
a Durbar gives one a very similar impression Her husband gardens in all
weathers When a man goes out in the pouring rain to brush caterpillars
off rosetrees I generally imagine his life indoors leaves something to
be desired anyway it must be very unsettling for the caterpillars

Of course there were other people there There was a Major Somebody who
had shot things in Lapland or somewhere of that sort I forget what they
were but it wasnt for want of reminding We had them cold with every
meal almost and he was continually giving us details of what they
measured from tip to tip as though he thought we were going to make them
warm underthings for the winter I used to listen to him with a rapt
attention that I thought rather suited me and then one day I quite
modestly gave the dimensions of an okapi I had shot in the Lincolnshire
fens The Major turned a beautiful Tyrian scarlet I remember thinking
at the time that I should like my bathroom hung in that colour and I
think that at that moment he almost found it in his heart to dislike me
Mrs Babwold put on a firstaidtotheinjured expression and asked him
why he didnt publish a book of his sporting reminiscences it would be
_so_ interesting She didnt remember till afterwards that he had given
her two fat volumes on the subject with his portrait and autograph as a
frontispiece and an appendix on the habits of the Arctic mussel

It was in the evening that we cast aside the cares and distractions of
the day and really lived Cards were thought to be too frivolous and
empty a way of passing the time so most of them played what they called
a book game You went out into the hallto get an inspiration I
supposethen you came in again with a muffler tied round your neck and
looked silly and the others were supposed to guess that you were Wee
MacGreegor I held out against the inanity as long as I decently could
but at last in a lapse of goodnature I consented to masquerade as a
book only I warned them that it would take some time to carry out They
waited for the best part of forty minutes while I went and played
wineglass skittles with the pageboy in the pantry you play it with a
champagne cork you know and the one who knocks down the most glasses
without breaking them wins I won with four unbroken out of seven I
think William suffered from overanxiousness They were rather mad in
the drawingroom at my not having come back and they werent a bit
pacified when I told them afterwards that I was At the end of the
passage

I never did like Kipling was Mrs Babwolds comment when the
situation dawned upon her I couldnt see anything clever in
_Earthworms out of Tuscany_or is that by Darwin

Of course these games are very educational but personally I prefer
bridge

On Christmas evening we were supposed to be specially festive in the Old
English fashion The hall was horribly draughty but it seemed to be the
proper place to revel in and it was decorated with Japanese fans and
Chinese lanterns which gave it a very Old English effect A young lady
with a confidential voice favoured us with a long recitation about a
little girl who died or did something equally hackneyed and then the
Major gave us a graphic account of a struggle he had with a wounded bear
I privately wished that the bears would win sometimes on these occasions
at least they wouldnt go vapouring about it afterwards Before we had
time to recover our spirits we were indulged with some thoughtreading
by a young man whom one knew instinctively had a good mother and an
indifferent tailorthe sort of young man who talks unflaggingly through
the thickest soup and smooths his hair dubiously as though he thought it
might hit back The thoughtreading was rather a success he announced
that the hostess was thinking about poetry and she admitted that her
mind was dwelling on one of Austins odes Which was near enough I
fancy she had been really wondering whether a scragend of mutton and
some cold plumpudding would do for the kitchen dinner next day As a
crowning dissipation they all sat down to play progressive halma with
milkchocolate for prizes Ive been carefully brought up and I dont
like to play games of skill for milkchocolate so I invented a headache
and retired from the scene I had been preceded a few minutes earlier by
Miss LangshanSmith a rather formidable lady who always got up at some
uncomfortable hour in the morning and gave you the impression that she
had been in communication with most of the European Governments before
breakfast There was a paper pinned on her door with a signed request
that she might be called particularly early on the morrow Such an
opportunity does not come twice in a lifetime I covered up everything
except the signature with another notice to the effect that before these
words should meet the eye she would have ended a misspent life was sorry
for the trouble she was giving and would like a military funeral A few
minutes later I violently exploded an airfilled paper bag on the
landing and gave a stage moan that could have been heard in the cellars
Then I pursued my original intention and went to bed The noise those
people made in forcing open the good ladys door was positively
indecorous she resisted gallantly but I believe they searched her for
bullets for about a quarter of an hour as if she had been an historic
battlefield

I hate travelling on Boxing Day but one must occasionally do things that
one dislikes




REGINALDS RUBAIYAT


The other day confided Reginald when I was killing time in the
bathroom and making bad resolutions for the New Year it occurred to me
that I would like to be a poet The chief qualification I understand
is that you must be born Well I hunted up my birth certificate and
found that I was all right on that score and then I got to work on a
Hymn to the New Year which struck me as having possibilities It
suggested extremely unusual things to absolutely unlikely people which I
believe is the art of firstclass catering in any department Quite the
best verse in it went something like this

 Have you heard the groan of a gravelled grouse
 Or the snarl of a snaffled snail
 Husband or mother like me or spouse
 Have you lain acreep in the darkened house
 Where the wounded wombats wail

It was quite improbable that anyone had you know and thats where it
stimulated the imagination and took people out of their narrow humdrum
selves No one has ever called me narrow or humdrum but even I felt
worked up now and then at the thought of that house with the stricken
wombats in it It simply wasnt nice But the editors were unanimous in
leaving it alone they said the thing had been done before and done
worse and that the market for that sort of work was extremely limited

It was just on the top of that discouragement that the Duchess wanted me
to write something in her albumsomething Persian you know and just a
little bit decadentand I thought a quatrain on an unwholesome egg would
meet the requirements of the case So I started in with

 Cackle cackle little hen
 How I wonder if and when
 Once you laid the egg that I
 Met alas too late Amen

The Duchess objected to the Amen which I thought gave an air of
forgiveness and _chose jugee_ to the whole thing also she said it wasnt
Persian enough as though I were trying to sell her a kitten whose mother
had married for love rather than pedigree So I recast it entirely and
the new version read

 The hen that laid thee moons ago who knows
 In what Dead Yesterday her shades repose
 To some election turn thy waning span
 And rain thy rottenness on fiscal foes

I thought there was enough suggestion of decay in that to satisfy a
jackal and to me there was something infinitely pathetic and appealing
in the idea of the egg having a sort of St Lukes summer of commercial
usefulness But the Duchess begged me to leave out any political
allusions shes the president of a Womens Something or other and she
said it might be taken as an endorsement of deplorable methods I never
can remember which Party Irene discourages with her support but I shant
forget an occasion when I was staying at her place and she gave me a
pamphlet to leave at the house of a doubtful voter and some grapes and
things for a woman who was suffering from a chill on the top of a patent
medicine I thought it much cleverer to give the grapes to the former
and the political literature to the sick woman and the Duchess was quite
absurdly annoyed about it afterwards It seems the leaflet was addressed
To those about to wobbleI wasnt responsible for the silly title of
the thingand the woman never recovered anyway the voter was
completely won over by the grapes and jellies and I think that should
have balanced matters The Duchess called it bribery and said it might
have compromised the candidate she was supporting he was expected to
subscribe to church funds and chapel funds and football and cricket
clubs and regattas and bazaars and beanfeasts and bellringers and
poultry shows and ploughing matches and readingrooms and choir outings
and shooting trophies and testimonials and anything of that sort but
bribery would not have been tolerated

I fancy I have perhaps more talent for electioneering than for poetry
and I was really getting extended over this quatrain business The egg
began to be unmanageable and the Duchess suggested something with a
French literary ring about it I hunted back in my mind for the most
familiar French classic that I could take liberties with and after a
little exercise of memory I turned out the following

 Hast thou the pen that once the gardener had
 I have it not and know these pears are bad
 Oh larger than the horses of the Prince
 Are those the general drives in Kaikobad

Even that didnt altogether satisfy Irene I fancy the geography of it
puzzled her She probably thought Kaikobad was an unfashionable German
spa where youd meet matrimonial bargainhunters and emergency Servian
kings My temper was beginning to slip its moorings by that time I
look rather nice when I lose my temper I hoped you would say I lose it
very often I mustnt monopolise the conversation

Of course if you want something really Persian and passionate with red
wine and bulbuls in it I went on to suggest but she grabbed the book
away from me

Not for worlds Nothing with red wine or passion in it Dear Agatha
gave me the album and she would be mortified to the quick

I said I didnt believe Agatha had a quick and we got quite heated in
arguing the matter Finally the Duchess declared I shouldnt write
anything nasty in her book and I said I wouldnt write anything in her
nasty book so there wasnt a very wide point of difference between us
For the rest of the afternoon I pretended to be sulking but I was really
working back to that quatrain like a foxterrier thats buried a
deferred lunch in a private flowerbed When I got an opportunity I
hunted up Agathas autograph which had the front page all to itself
and copying her prim handwriting as well as I could I inserted above it
the following Thibetan fragment

 With Thee oh my Beloved to do a dak
 a dak I believe is a sort of uncomfortable postjourney
 On the packsaddle of a grunting yak
 With never room for chilling chaperone
 Twere better than a Panhard in the Park

That Agatha would get on to a yak in company with a lover even in the
comparative seclusion of Thibet is unthinkable I very much doubt if
shed do it with her own husband in the privacy of the Simplon tunnel
But poetry as Ive remarked before should always stimulate the

By the way when you asked me the other day to dine with you on the 14th
I said I was dining with the Duchess Well Im not Im dining with
you




THE INNOCENCE OF REGINALD


Reginald slid a carnation of the newest shade into the buttonhole of his
latest lounge coat and surveyed the result with approval I am just in
the mood he observed to have my portrait painted by someone with an
unmistakable future So comforting to go down to posterity as Youth
with a Pink Carnation in cataloguecompany with Child with Bunch of
Primroses and all that crowd

Youth said the Other should suggest innocence

But never act on the suggestion I dont believe the two ever really go
together People talk vaguely about the innocence of a little child but
they take mighty good care not to let it out of their sight for twenty
minutes The watched pot never boils over I knew a boy once who really
was innocent his parents were in Society but they never gave him a
moments anxiety from his infancy He believed in company prospectuses
and in the purity of elections and in women marrying for love and even
in a system for winning at roulette He never quite lost his faith in
it but he dropped more money than his employers could afford to lose
When last I heard of him he was believing in his innocence the jury
werent All the same I really am innocent just now of something
everyone accuses me of having done and so far as I can see their
accusations will remain unfounded

Rather an unexpected attitude for you

I love people who do unexpected things Didnt you always adore the man
who slew a lion in a pit on a snowy day But about this unfortunate
innocence Well quite long ago when Id been quarrelling with more
people than usual you among the numberit must have been in November I
never quarrel with you too near ChristmasI had an idea that Id like to
write a book It was to be a book of personal reminiscences and was to
leave out nothing

Reginald

Exactly what the Duchess said when I mentioned it to her I was
provoking and said nothing and the next thing of course was that
everyone heard that Id written the book and got it in the press After
that I might have been a goldfish in a glass bowl for all the privacy I
got People attacked me about it in the most unexpected places and
implored or commanded me to leave out things that Id forgotten had ever
happened I sat behind Miriam Klopstock one night in the dress circle at
His Majestys and she began at once about the incident of the Chow dog
in the bathroom which she insisted must be struck out We had to argue
it in a disjointed fashion because some of the people wanted to listen
to the play and Miriam takes nines in voices They had to stop her
playing in the Macaws Hockey Club because you could hear what she
thought when her shins got mixed up in a scrimmage for half a mile on a
still day They are called the Macaws because of their blueandyellow
costumes but I understand there was nothing yellow about Miriams
language I agreed to make one alteration as I pretended I had got it a
Spitz instead of a Chow but beyond that I was firm She megaphoned back
two minutes later You promised you would never mention it dont you
ever keep a promise When people had stopped glaring in our direction
I replied that Id as soon think of keeping white mice I saw her
tearing little bits out of her programme for a minute or two and then
she leaned back and snorted Youre not the boy I took you for as
though she were an eagle arriving at Olympus with the wrong Ganymede
That was her last audible remark but she went on tearing up her
programme and scattering the pieces around her till one of her
neighbours asked with immense dignity whether she should send for a
wastepaper basket I didnt stay for the last act

Then there is Mrsoh I never can remember her name she lives in a
street that the cabmen have never heard of and is at home on Wednesdays
She frightened me horribly once at a private view by saying mysteriously
I oughtnt to be here you know this is one of my days I thought she
meant that she was subject to periodical outbreaks and was expecting an
attack at any moment So embarrassing if she had suddenly taken it into
her head that she was Cesar Borgia or St Elizabeth of Hungary That
sort of thing would make one unpleasantly conspicuous even at a private
view However she merely meant to say that it was Wednesday which at
the moment was incontrovertible Well shes on quite a different tack
to the Klopstock She doesnt visit anywhere very extensively and of
course shes awfully keen for me to drag in an incident that occurred at
one of the Beauwhistle gardenparties when she says she accidentally hit
the shins of a Serene Somebody or other with a croquet mallet and that he
swore at her in German As a matter of fact he went on discoursing on
the GordonBennett affair in French I never can remember if its a new
submarine or a divorce Of course how stupid of me To be
disagreeably exact I fancy she missed him by about two
inchesoveranxiousness probablybut she likes to think she hit him
Ive felt that way with a partridge which I always imagine keeps on
flying strong out of false pride till its the other side of the hedge
She said she could tell me everything she was wearing on the occasion I
said I didnt want my book to read like a laundry list but she explained
that she didnt mean those sort of things

And theres the Chilworth boy who can be charming as long as hes
content to be stupid and wear what hes told to but he gets the idea now
and then that hed like to be epigrammatic and the result is like
watching a rook trying to build a nest in a gale Since he got wind of
the book hes been persecuting me to work in something of his about the
Russians and the Yalu Peril and is quite sulky because I wont do it

Altogether I think it would be rather a brilliant inspiration if you
were to suggest a fortnight in Paris
