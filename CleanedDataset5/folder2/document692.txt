Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtytwo text
files per month or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 10 of the present number of computer users 2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that so it
will require us reaching less than 5 of the users in 2001

ECCENTRIC MR CLARK

All who knew Mr Clark intimately casually
or by sight alone smiled always meeting
him and thought What an odd man he is Not
that there was anything extremely or ridiculously
obtrusive in Mr Clarks peculiarities either of
feature dress or deportment by which a graded
estimate of his really quaint character might aptly be
given but rather perhaps it was the curious
combination of all these things that had gained
for Mr Clark the transient celebrity of being a
very eccentric man

And Mr Clark of all the odd inhabitants of the
busy metropolis in which he lived seemed least
conscious of the fact of his local prominence True
it was that when familiarly addressed as Clark
old boy by sportive individuals he never recollected
having seen before he would oftentimes stare
blankly in return and with evident embarrassment
but as these actions may have been attributable to
weak eyes or to the confusion consequent upon
being publicly recognized by the quondam associates
of bacchanalian hours the suggestive facts only
served to throw his eccentricities in new relief

And in the minds of many that Mr Clark was somewhat given to
dissipation there was but little
doubt for although in no way and at no time
derelict in the rigid duties imposed upon him as
an accountant in a wholesale liquor house on South
John Street a grand majority of friends had long
ago conceded that a certain puffiness of flesh and
a soiledlike pallor of complexion were in nowise
the legitimate result of overapplication simply in
the countingroom of the establishment in which he
found employment but as to the complicity of Mr
Clarks direct associates in this belief it is only
justice to the gentleman to state that by them
he was held above all such suspicion from the
grayhaired senior of the firm down to the pink
nosed porter of the warerooms who upon every
available occasion would point out the eccentric
Mr Clark as the ony man in the biznez at never
sunk a thief er drunk a drop o goods o any
kind under no consideration

And Mr Clark himself when playfully
approached on the subject would quietly assert that
never under any circumstances had the taste of
intoxicating liquors passed his lips though at such
asseverations it was a noticeable fact that Mr
Clarks complexion invariably grew more sultry
than its wont and that his eyes forever moist grew
dewier and that his lips and tongue would seem
covertly entering upon some lush conspiracy which
in its incipiency he would be forced to smother with
his hastily drawn handkerchief Then the eccentric
Mr Clark would laugh nervously and pouncing
on some subject so vividly unlike the one just
preceding it as to daze the listener he would ripple
ahead with a tide of eloquence that positively
overflowed and washed away all remembrance of the
opening topic

In point of age Mr Clark might have been thirty
thirtyfive or even forty years were one to venture
an opinion solely by outward appearance and under
certain circumstances and surroundings As for
example when a dozen years ago the writer of this
sketch rode twenty miles in a freightcaboose with
Mr Clark as the only other passenger he seemed
in age at first not less than thirtyfive but on
opening a conversation with him in which he joined
with wonderful vivacity a nearer view and a
prolonged and studious one as well revealed the rather
curious fact that at the very limit of all allowable
supposition his age could not possibly have exceeded
twentyfive

What it was in the man that struck me as
eccentric at that time I have never been wholly
able to define but I recall accurately the most
trivial occurrences of our meeting and the very
subjectmatter of our conversation I even remember
the very words in which he declined a drink
from my travelingflaskfor Its a raw day I
said by way of gratuitous excuse for offering it
Yes he said smilingly motioning the temptation
aside it is a raw day but youre rather young in
years to be doctoring the weatherat least youd
better change the treatmenttheyll all be raw days
for you after a while I confess that I even
felt an inward pity for the man as I laughingly
drained his health and returned the flask to my
valise But when I asked him ten minutes later
the nature of the business in which he was engaged
and he handed me in response and without comment
the card of a wholesale liquor house with
his own name in crimson letters struck diagonally
across the surface I winked naively to myself and
thought Ahha And as if reading my very
musings he said Why certainly I carry a full
line of samples but my dear young friend dont
imagine for a minute that I refuse your brand on
that account You can rest assured that I have
nothing better in my cases Whisky is whisky
wherever it is found and there is no best
whiskynot in all the world

Truly I thought this is an odd source for the
emanation of temperance sentimentsthen said
aloud And yet you engage in a business you
dislike Traffic in an article that you yourself
condemn Do I understand you

Might there not be such a thing he said
quietly as inheriting a businessthe same as
inheriting an appetite However one advances by
gradations I shall SELL no more This is my last
trip on the road in that capacity I am coming in
now to take charge of the firms books Would be
glad to have you call on me any time youre in the
city Goodby And as he swung off the slowly
moving train now entering the city and I stood
watching him from the open door of the caboose
as he rapidly walked down a suburban street I
was positive his gait was anything but steadythat
the stepthe figurethe whole air of the man was
that of one then laboring under the effects of
partial intoxication

I have always liked peculiar people no matter
where I met them no matter who they were if
once impressed with an eccentricity of character
which I have reason to believe purely unaffected I
never quite forget the person name or place of
our first meeting or where the interesting party
may be found again And so it was in the customary
order of things that during hasty visits to the
city I often called on the eccentric Mr Clark and
as he had promised on our first acquaintance he
seemed always glad to see and welcome me in his
new office The more I knew of him the more I
liked him but I think I never fully understood him
No one seemed to know him quite so well as that

Once I had a little private talk regarding him with
the senior partner of the firm for which he worked
Mr Clark just prior to my call had gone to lunch
would be back in half an hour Would I wait there
in the office until his return Certainly And the
chatty senior entertained meQueer fellowMr
Clarkas his father was before him Used to be
a member of the firmhis father in fact founded
the businessmade a fortune at itfailed for an
unfortunate reason and went up the flume Paid
every dollar that he owed however sacrificing the
very home that sheltered his wife and children
but never rallied He had quite a family then
Oh yes had a familynot a large one but a
bright oneonly they all seemed more or less
unfortunate The father was unfortunatevery and
died so leaving his wife and two boysthe older
son much like the fathersplendid business
capacities but lacked willcouldnt resist some things
even weaker than the father in that regard and
died at half his age

But the younger brotherour Mr Clark
remained and he was sterlingstraight goods in
all respects Lived with his motherwas her
sole support A proud woman Mrs Clark
a proud woman with a broken spiritwithdrawn
entirely from the world and had been
so for years and years The Clarks as had been
mentioned were all peculiareven the younger Mr
Clark our friend I had doubtless noticed was an
odd genius but he had staminasomething solid
about him for all his eccentricitiescould be relied
on Had been with the house there since a boy
of twelvetook him for the fathers sake had never
missed a days time in any line of work that ever
had been given in his chargewas weaklylooking
too Had worked his way from the cellar upfrom
the least pay to the highesthad saved enough to
buy and pay for a comfortable house for his mother
and himself and still a lad maintained the
expense of companion attendant and maid servant for
the mother Yet with all this burden on his
shoulders the boy had worried through some way with
a jolly smile and a good word for every one A
boy sir the enthusiastic senior concludeda boy
sir that never was a boy and never had a taste of
genuine boyhood in his lifeno more than he ever
took a taste of whisky and you couldnt get that
in him with a funnel

At this juncture Mr Clark himself appeared and
in a particularly happy frame of mind For an
hour the delighted senior and myself sat laughing at
the fellows quaint conceits and witty sayings the
conversation at last breaking up with an abrupt
proposition from Mr Clark that I remain in the
city overnight and accompany him to the theater
an invitation I rather eagerly accepted Mr Clark
thanking me and pivoting himself around on his
high stool with a mechanical Good afternoon
was at once submerged in his books while the senior
following me out and stepping into a carriage that
stood waiting for him at the curb waved me adieu
and was driven away I turned my steps up the
street but remembering that my friend had fixed no
place to meet me in the evening I stepped back into
the storeroom and again pushed open the glass door
of the office

Mr Clark still sat on the high stool at his desk
his back toward the door and his ledger spread out
before him

Mr Clark I called

He made no answer

Mr Clark I called again in an elevated key

He did not stir

I paused a moment then went over to him letting
my hand drop lightly on his arm

Still no response I only felt the shoulder heave
as with a longdrawn quavering sigh then heard the
regular though labored breathing of a weary man
that slept

I had not the heart to waken him but lifting the
still moistened pen from his unconscious fingers I
wrote where I might be found at eight that evening
folded and addressed the note and laying it on
the open page before him turned quietly away

Poor man I mused compassionately with a
touch of youthful sentiment affecting mePoor
man Working himself into his very grave and
with never a sign or murmur of complaintworn
and weighed down with the burden of his work and
yet with a nobleness of spirit and resolve that still
conceals behind glad smiles and laughing words
the cares that lie so heavily upon him

The long afternoon went by at last and evening
came and as promptly as my note requested the
jovial Mr Clark appeared laughing heartily as
we walked off down the street at my explanation
of the reason I had written my desires instead of
verbally addressing him and laughing still louder
when I told him of my fears that he was overworking
himself

Oh no my friend he answered gaily
theres no occasion for anxiety on that account
But the fact is old man he went on half apologetically
the fact is I havent been so overworked
of late as overwakeful Theres something in the
night I think that does it Do you know that the
night is a great mystery to mea great mystery
And it seems to be growing on me all the time
Theres the trouble The night to me is like some
vast incomprehensible being When I write the
name night I instinctively write it with a capital
And I like my night deep and dark and swarthy
dont you know Now some like clear and starry
nights but theyre too pale for metoo weak and
fragile altogether Theyre popular with the
masses of course these blueeyed goldenhaired
moonlightonthelake nights but somehow I
dont stand in with them My favorite night is
the pronounced brunettethe darker the better To
night is one of my kind and shes growing more
and more like it all the time If it were not for
depriving you of the theater Id rather just drift
off now in the deepening gloom till swallowed up
in itlost utterly Come with me anyhow

Gladly I answered catching something of his
own enthusiasm I myself prefer it to the play

I heartily congratulate you on your taste he
said diving violently for my hand and wringing it

Oh its going to be grimly gloriousa depth of
darkness one can wade out into and knead in his
hands like dough And he laughed himself at
this grotesque conceit

And so we walkedfor hours Our talkor
rather my friends talklulled and soothed at last
into a calmer flow almost solemn in its tone and
yet fretted with an occasional wildness of utterance
and expression

Half consciously I had been led by my companion
who for an hour had been drawing closer to me
as we walked His arm thrust through my own
clung almost affectionately We were now in some
strange suburb of the city evidently too in a low
quarter for from the windows of such business
rooms and shops as bore any evidence of respectability
the lights had been turned out and the doors
locked for the night Only a gruesome green light
was blazing in a little drugstore just opposite
while at our left as we turned the corner a tumble
down saloon sent out on the night a mingled
sound of clicking billiardballs discordant voices
the harsher rasping of a violin together with the
sullen plunkings of a banjo

I must leave you here for a minute said my
friend abruptly breaking a long silence and loosening
my arm The druggist over there is a patron
of our house and I am reminded of a little business
I have with him He is about closing too and
Ill see him now as I may not be down this way
again soon No you wait here for meright here
and he playfully but firmly pushed me back ran
across the street and entered the store Through
the open door I saw him shake hands with the man
who stood behind the counter and stand talking
in the same position for some minutesboth still
clasping hands as it seemed but as I mechanically
bent with closer scrutiny the druggist seemed to be
examining the hand of Mr Clark and working at
it as though picking at a splinter in the palmI
I could not quite determine what was being done
for a glass showcase blurred an otherwise clear
view of the arms of both from the elbows down
Then they came forward Mr Clark arranging his
cuffs and the druggist wrapping up some minute
article he took from an upper showcase and handing
it to my friend who placed it in the pocket of
his vest and turned away At this moment my
attention was withdrawn by an extra tumult of jeers
and harsh laughter in the saloon from the door of
which even as my friend turned from the door
opposite a drunken woman reeled and staggering
round the corner as my friend came up fell
violently forward on the pavement not ten steps in
our advance Instinctively we both sprang to her
aid and bending over the senseless figure peered
curiously at the bruised and bleeding features My
friend was trembling with excitement He clutched
wildly at the limp form trying but vainly to lift the
woman to her feet Why dont you take hold of
her he whispered hoarsely Help me with her
quick quick Lift her up I obeyed without a
word though with a shudder of aversion as a drop
of hot red blood stung me on the hand

Now draw her arm about your shoulderthis
wayand hold it so And now your other arm
around her waistquick man quick as you yourself
will want Gods arm about you when you fail
Now come And with no other word we hurried
with our burden up the empty darkness of the
street

I was utterly bewildered with it all but something
kept me silent And so we hurried on and on and
on our course directed by my now wholly reticent
companion Where he was going what his purpose
was I could not but vaguely surmise I only recognized
that his intentions were humane which fact
was emphasized by the extreme caution he took to
avoid the two or three late pedestrians that passed
us on our way as we stood crowded in concealment
once behind a low shed once in an entryway
and once at the distant rattle of a police whistle
we hurried through the blackness of a narrow alley
into the silent street beyond And on up this we
passed until at last we paused at the gateway of a
cottage on our left On to the door of that we went
my friend first violently jerking the bell then opening
the door with a nightkey and with me lifting
the still senseless woman through the hall into a
dimly lighted room upon the right and laying her
upon a clean white bed that glimmered in the corner
He reached and turned the gas on in a flaring jet
and as he did so This is my home he whispered
and this woman ismy mother He flung himself
upon his knees beside her as he spoke He laid
his quivering lips against the white hair and the
ruddy wound upon the brow then dappled with his
kisses the pale face and stroked and petted and
caressed the faded hands O God he moaned if
I might only weep

The steps of some one coming down the stairs
aroused him He stepped quickly to the door and
threw it open It was a woman servant He
simply pointed to the form upon the bed

Oh sir exclaimed the frightened woman
what has happened What has happened to my
poor dear mistress

Why did you let her leave the house

She sent me away sir I never dreamed that
she was going out again She told me she was very
sleepy and wanted to retire and I helped her to
undress before I went But she aint bad hurt is
she she continued stooping over the still figure
and tenderly smoothing back the disheveled hair
Its only the cheek bruised and the forehead cut
a littleits the blood that makes it look like a bad
hurt See when I bathe it it is not a bad hurt sir
Shes just beenshes just worn out poor thing
and shes asleepthats all

He made no answer to the womans speech but
turned toward me Five doors from here he
said and to your left as you go out you will find
the residence of Dr Worrel Go to him for me and
tell him he is wanted here at once Tell him my
mother is much worse He will understand I
would go myself but must see about arranging for
your comfort upon your return for you will not
leave me till broad daylightyou must not I
bowed in silent acceptance of his wishes and turned
upon my errand

Fortunately the doctor was at home and
returned at once with me to my friend where after a
careful examination of his patient he assured the
anxious son that the wounds were only slight and
that her unconscious condition was simply the result
of overstimulation perhaps as he delicately
put it She would doubtless waken in her usual
rational statean occurrence really more to be
feared than desired since her peculiar sensitiveness
might feel too keenly the unfortunate happening
Anyway he continued I will call early in the
morning and in the event of her awakening before
that time I will leave a sedative with Mary with
directions she will attend to She will remain here
at her side And as to yourself Mr Clark the
doctor went on in an anxious tone as he marked the
haggard face and hollow eyes I insist that you
retire You must rest sirworrying for the past
week as you have been doing is telling on you
painfully You need restand you must take it

And I will said Mr Clark submissively
Stooping again he clasped the sleeping face between
his hands and kissed it tenderly Good night I
heard him whispergood nightgood night He
turned and motioning for me to follow opened the
doorDoctor good night Good night Mary

He led the way to his own room upstairs And
now my friend he said as he waved me to an easy
chair I have but two other favors to ask of you
The first is that you talk to me or read to me or
tell me fairy tales or riddlesanything so that you
keep it up incessantly and never leave off till you
find me fast asleep Then in the next room you
will find a comfortable bed Leave me sleeping
here and you sleep there And the second favor
he continued with a slow smile and an affected air
of great deliberationoh well Ill not ask the
second favor of you now Ill keep it for you till
tomorrow And as he turned laughingly away and
paced three or four times across the room in his
step his gait the general carriage of the figure I
was curiously reminded of the time years before
that I had watched him from the door of the caboose
as he walked up the suburban street till the
movement of the train had hidden him from view

Well what will you do he asked as he wheeled
a cozycushioned lounge close beside my chair and
removing his coat flung himself languidly down
Will you talk or read to me

I will read I said as I picked up a book to
begin my vigil

Hold just a minute then he said drawing a
card and pencil from his vestI may want to
jot down a note or twoNow go ahead

I had been reading in a low voice steadily for
perhaps an hour my companion never stirring from
his first position but although my eyes were never
lifted from the book I knew by the occasional sound
of his pencil that he had not yet dropped asleep
And so without a pause I read monotonously on
At last he turned heavily I paused With his eyes
closed he groped his hand across my knees and
grasped my own Go on with the reading he
said drowsilyGuess Im going to sleep nowbut
you go right on with the storyGood night His
hand fumbled lingeringly a moment then was withdrawn
and folded with the other on his breast

I read on in a lower tone an hour longer then
paused again to look at my companion He was
sleeping heavily and although the features in their
repose appeared unusually pale a wholesome perspiration
as it seemed pervaded all the face while the
breathing though labored was regular I bent
above him to lower the pillow for his head and the
movement half aroused him as I thought at first
for he muttered something as though impatiently
but listening to catch his mutterings I knew that
he was dreaming Its what killed father I heard
him say And its what killed Tom he went on
in a smothered voice killed bothkilled both It
shant kill me I swear it I could bottle itcase
after caseand never touch a drop If you never
take the first drink youll never want it Mother
taught me that What made her ever take the first
Mother mother When I get to be a man Ill
buy her all the fine things she used to have when
father was alive Maybe I can buy back the old
home with the roses up the walk and the sunshine
slanting in the hall


And so the sleeper murmured on Sometimes
the voice was thick and discordant sometimes low
and clear and tuneful as a childs Never touch
whisky he went on almost harshly Never
never Drop in the street first I did The doctor
will come then and he knows what you want Not
whiskyMedicine the kind that makes you warm
againmakes you want to live but dont ever dare
touch whisky Let other people drink it if they
want it Sell it to them theyll get it anyhow but
dont you touch it It killed your father it killed
Tom andohmother mother mother Tears
actually teemed from underneath the sleepers lids
and glittered down the pallid and distorted features
Theres a medicine thats good for you when you
want whisky he went onWhen you are weak
and everybody else is strongand always when the
flagstones give way beneath your feet and the long
street undulates and wavers as you walk why
thats a sign for you to take that medicineand
take it quick Oh it will warm you till the little
pale blue streaks in your white hands will bulge out
again with tingling blood and it will start up from
its stagnant pools and leap from vein to vein till it
reaches your beings furthest height and droops and
falls and folds down over icy brow and face like a
soft veil moistened with pure warmth Ah it is
so deliriously sweet and restful

I heard a moaning in the room below and then
steps on the stairs and a tapping at the door It
was Mary Mrs Clark had awakened and was
crying for her son But we must not waken him I
said Give Mrs Clark the medicine the doctor left
for herthat will quiet her

But she wont take it sir She wont do
anything at all for meand if Mr Clark could only
come to her for just a minute she would

The womans speech was broken by a shrill cry
in the hall and then the thud of naked feet on the
stairway I want my boymy boy wailed the
hysterical woman from without

Go to your mistressquick I said sternly
pushing the maid from the roomTake her back
I will come down to your assistance in a moment
Then I turned hastily to see if the sleeper had been
disturbed by the womans cries but all was peaceful
with him yet and so throwing a coverlet over
him I drew the door to silently and went below

I found the wretched mother in an almost frenzied
state and her increasing violence alarmed
me so that I thought it best to summon the physician
again and bidding the servant not to leave
her for an instant I hurried for the help so badly
needed This time the doctor was long delayed
although he joined me with all possible haste and
with all speed accompanied me back to the unhappy
home Entering the door our ears were greeted
with a shriek that came piercing down the hall till
the very echoes shuddered as with fear It was the
patients voice shrilling from the sleepers room up
stairsO God My boy my boy I want my
boy and he will not waken for me An instant
later we were both upon the scene

The woman in her frenzy had broken from the
servant to find her son And she had found him

She had wound her arms about him and had
dragged his still sleeping form upon the floor He
would not waken even though she gripped him to
her heart and shrieked her very soul out in his ears
He would not waken The face though whiter
than her own betokened only utter rest and peace
We drew her limp and voiceless from his side
We are too late the doctor whispered lifting with
his finger one of the closed lids and letting it drop
to againSee here He had been feeling at the
wrist and as he spoke he slipped the sleeve up
bared the sleepers arm From the wrist to elbow it
was livid purple and pitted and scarred with minute
woundssome scarcely scaled as yet with clotted
blood

In heavens name what does it all mean I
asked

Morphine said the doctor and the
hypodermic And here he exclaimed lifting the other
handhere is a folded card with your name at the
top

I snatched it from him and I read written in
faint but rounded characters


I like to hear your voice It sounds kind It is
like a faroff tune To drop asleep though as I
am doing now is sweeter musicbut read onI
have taken something to make me sleep and by
mistake I have taken too much but you will read
right on Now mind you this is not suicide as
God listens to the whisper of this pencil as I write
I did it by mistake For years and years I have
taken the same thing This time I took too much
much more than I meant tobut I am glad This
is the second favor I would ask Go to my employers
tomorrow show them this handwriting and
say I know for my sake they will take charge of
my affairs and administer all my estate in the best
way suited to my mothers needs Goodby my
friendI can only say good night to you when I
shall take your hand an instant later and turn away
forever


Through tears I read it all and ending with his
name in full I turned and looked down on the face
of this man that I had learned to love and the
full measure of his needed rest was with him and
the rainy day that glowered and drabbled at the
eastern window of the room was as drearily stared
back at by a hopeless womans dull demented eyes



A NESTEGG

But a few miles from the city here and on the
sloping banks of the stream noted more for its
plenitude of chubs and shiners than the gamier
two and fourpound bass for which in season so
many credulous anglers flock and lie in wait stands
a country residence so convenient to the stream
and so inviting in its pleasant exterior and
comfortable surroundingsbarn dairy and spring
housethat the weary sunburned and disheartened
fisherman out from the dusty town for a day of
recreation is often wont to seek its hospitality

The house in style of architecture is something of
a departure from the typical farmhouse being
designed and fashioned with no regard to symmetry
or proportion but rather as is suggested built to
conform to the matteroffact and most sensible
ideas of its owner who if it pleased him would
have small windows where large ones ought to be
and vice versa whether they balanced properly to
the eye or not And chimneyshe would have as
many as he wanted and no two alike in either
height or size And if he wanted the front of the
house turned from all possible view as though
abashed at any chance of public scrutiny why that
was his affair and not the publics and with like
perversity if he chose to thrust his kitchen under the publics
very nose what should the generally
faggedout halffamished representative of that
dignified public do but reel in his dead minnow
shoulder his fishingrod clamber over the back
fence of the old farmhouse and inquire within or
jog back to the city inwardly anathematizing that
particular locality or the whole rural district
in general That is just the way that farmhouse
looked to the writer of this sketch one week ago
so individual it seemedso liberal and yet so
independent It wasnt even weatherboarded but
instead was covered smoothly with cement
as though the plasterers had come while the folks
were visiting and so unable to get at the interior
had just plastered the outside

I am more than glad that I was hungry enough
and weary enough and wise enough to take the
house at its first suggestion for putting away my
fishingtackle for the morning at least I went up
the sloping bank crossed the dusty road and
confidently clambered over the fence

Not even a growling dog to intimate that I was
trespassing All was opengraciouslookingpastoral
The sward beneath my feet was velvetlike
in elasticity and the scarce visible path I followed
through it led promptly to the open kitchen door
From within I heard a woman singing some old
ballad in an undertone while at the threshold a
trim whitespurred rooster stood poised on one foot
curving his glossy neck and cocking his wattled
head as though to catch the meaning of the words
I paused It was a scene I felt restrained from
breaking in upon nor would I have but for the
sound of a strong male voice coming around the
corner of the house

Sir Howdy

Turning I saw a roughlooking but kindly
featured man of sixtyfive evidently the owner of the
place

I returned his salutation with some confusion
and much deference I must really beg your pardon
for this intrusion I began but I have been
tiring myself out fishing and your home here looked
so pleasantand I felt so thirstyand

Want a drink I reckon said the old man
turning abruptly toward the kitchen door then pausing
as suddenly with a backward motion of his thumb
jest follow the path here down to the little
brickthats the springand youll find at youve
come to the right place fer drinkinworter Hold
on a minute tel I get you a tumblertheres nothin
down there but a tin

Then dont trouble yourself any further I
said heartily for Id rather drink from a tin cup
than a goblet of pure gold

And sod I said the old man reflectively
turning mechanically and following me down the path
 Druther drink out of a tiner jest a fruitcan
with the top knocked offererer a gourd he
added in a zestful reminiscent tone of voice that
so heightened my impatient thirst that I reached
the springhouse fairly in a run

Wellsir exclaimed my host in evident
delight as I stood dipping my nose in the second
cupful of the cool revivifying liquid and peering in a
congratulatory kind of way at the blurred and rubicund
reflection of my features in the bottom of the
cup wellsir blamedon ef it dont do a feller
good to see you enjoyin of it thataway But dont
you drink too much o the wortercause theres
some sweet milk over there in one o them crocks
maybe and ef youll jest kind o keerfullike lift
off the led of that third one say over there to
yer left and dip you out a tinful er two o that
wy itll do you good to drink it and itll do me
good to see you at it But hold uphold up
he called abruptly as nowise loath I bent above
the vessel designated Hold yer hosses fer a second
Heres Marthy let her git it fer ye

If I was at first surprised and confused meeting
the master of the house I was wholly startled and
chagrined in my present position before its mistress
But as I arose and stammered in my confusion
some incoherent apology I was again reassured and
put at greater ease by the comprehensive and
forgiving smile the woman gave me as I yielded her
my place and with lifted hat awaited her further
kindness

I came just in time sir she said half
laughingly as with strong bare arms she reached across
the gurgling trough and replaced the lid that I had
partially removedI came just in time I see to
prevent father from having you dip into the mornings
milk which of course has scarcely a veil of
cream over the face of it as yet But men as you
are doubtless willing to admit she went on jocularly
dont know about these things You must
pardon father as much for his wellmeaning ignorance
of such matters as for this cup of cream
which I am sure you will better relish

She arose still smiling with her eyes turned
frankly on my own And I must be excused when
I confess that as I bowed my thanks taking the
proffered cup and lifting it to my lips I stared
with an uncommon interest and pleasure at the
donors face

She was a woman of certainly not less than forty
years of age But the figure and the rounded grace
and fulness of it together with the features and the
eyes completed as fine a specimen of physical and
mental health as ever it has been my fortune to
meet there was something so full of purpose and
resolvesomething so wholesome too about the
charactersomething so womanlyI might almost
say manly and would but for the petty prejudice
maybe occasioned by the trivial fact of a locket
having dropped from her bosom as she knelt and
that trinket still dangles in my memory even as it
then dangled and dropped back to its concealment
in her breast as she arose But her face by no
means handsome in the common sense of the word
was marked with a breadth and strength of outline
and expression that approached the heroica face
that once seen is forever fixed in memorya personage
once met one must know more of And so it
was that an hour later as I strolled with the old
man about his farm looking to all intents with the
profoundest interest at his Devonshires Shorthorns
Jerseys and the like I lured from him something
of an outline of his daughters history

Therere no better girl n Marthy he said
mechanically answering some ingenious allusion to
her worth And yit he went on reflectively
stooping from his seat in the barn door and with
his open jackknife picking up a little chip with the
point of the bladeand yityou wouldnt believe
itbut Marthy was the oldest o three daughters
and hedI may sayhed more advantages o marryin
and yit as I was jest goin to say shes the
very one at didnt marry Hed every advantage
Marthy did Wy we even hed her educatedher
mother was alivin thenand we was well enough
fixed to afford the educatin of her mother allus
contendedand we wasbesides it was Marthys
notion too and you know how women is thataway
when they git their head set So we sent Marthy
down to Indianoplus and got her books and put
her in school there and paid fer her keepin and
everthing and she jestwell you may say lived
there stiddy fer bettern four year O course
shed git back ever onceanawhile but her visits
was allus somewayanother onsatisfactorylike
cause you see Marthy was allus my favorite and
Id allus laughed and told her at the other girls
could git marrid ef they wanted but SHE was goin
to be the nestegg of our family and slong as I
lived I wanted her at home with me And shed
laugh and contend at shed as lif be an old maid as
not and never expected to marry ner didnt want
to

But she had me sceart onct though Come
out from the city one time durin the army with
a peartlookin young feller in blue clothes and gilt
straps on his shoulders Young lieutenant he was
name o Morris Was layin in camp there in the
city somers I disremember which camp it was
now adzacklybut anyway it peared like he had
plenty o time to go and come fer from that time
on he kep on acominever time Marthy ud
come home hed come too and I got to noticin at
Marthy come home a good eal moren she used to
afore Morris first brought her And blame ef the
thing didnt git to worryin me And onct I spoke
to mother about it and told her ef I thought the
feller wanted to marry Marthy Id jest stop his
comin right then and there But mother she sort o
smiled and said somepin bout men anever seein
through nothin and when I ast her what she meant
wy she ups and tells me at Morris didnt keer
nothin fer Marthy ner Marthy fer Morris and
then went on to tell me that Morris was kind o
aidgin up tords Annieshe was next to Marthy
you know in pint of years and experience but
everbody allus said at Annie was the purtiest one
o the whole three of em And so when mother
told me at the signs pinted tords Annie wy of course I
hednt no particular objections to that
cause Morris was of good fambly enough it turned
out and in fact was as stirrin a young feller as
ever I want fer a soninlaw and so I hed nothin
more to sayner they wasnt no occasion to say
nothin cause right along about then I begin to
notice at Marthy quit comin home so much and
Morris kep acomin more

Tel finally one time he was out here all by
hisself long about dusk come out here where
I was feedin and ast me all at onct and in
a straightforard way ef he couldnt marry
Annie and somewayanother blame ef it didnt
make me happy as him when I told him yes
You see that thing proved pineblank at he wasnt
afishin round fer Marthy Wellsir as luck would
hev it Marthy got home about a halfhour later
and Ill give you my word I was never so glad to
see the girl in my life It was foolish in me I
reckon but when I see her drivin up the lane
it was purt nigh dark then but I could see her
through the open winder from where I was sittin
at the suppertable and so I jest quietly excused
myself plitelike as a feller will you know when
theys compny round and slipped off and met her
jest as she was about to git out to open the barn
gate Hold up Marthy says I set right where
you air Ill open the gate fer you and Ill do
anything else fer you in the world at you want me to

 Wy whats pleased YOU so she says
laughin as she druv through slowlike and aticklin my nose
with the cracker of the buggywhipWhats
pleased YOU

 Guess says I jerkin the gate to and turnin to
lift her out

 The new peanners come says she eagerlike

 Yer new peanners come says I but thats
not it

 Strawberries for supper says she

 Strawberries fer supper says I but that
aint it

Jest then Morriss hoss whinnied in the barn
and she glanced up quick and smilin and says
Somebody come to see somebody

 Youre agittin warm says I

 Somebody come to see ME she says anxiouslike

 No says I and Im glad of itfer this one
ats come wants to git married and o course I
wouldnt harber in my house no young feller at
was alayin round fer a chance to steal away the
Nestegg  says I laughin

Marthy had riz up in the buggy by this time
but as I helt up my hands to her she sort o drawed
back a minute and says all seriouslike and kind o
whisperin

 Is it ANNIE

I nodded Yes says I and whats more Ive
give my consent and mothers give hernthe things
all settled Come jump out and run in and be
happy with the rest of us and I helt out my hands
agin but she didnt pear to take no heed She was kind o
pale too I thought and swallered a
time er two like as ef she couldnt speak plain

 Who is the man she ast

 Whowhos the man I says agittin kind o
out o patience with the girlWy you know who
it is o courseIts Morris says I Come jump
down Dont you see Im waitin fer ye

 Then take me she says and blamedon ef
the girl didnt keel right over in my arms as limber
as a rag Clean fainted away Honest Jest the
excitement I reckon o breakin it to her so suddent
likecause she liked Annie Ive sometimes
thought bettern even she did her own mother
Didnt go half so hard with her when her other
sister married Yessir said the old man by way
of sweeping conclusion as he rose to his feet
Marthys the ony one of em at never married
both the others is goneMorris went all through
the army and got back safe and sounds livin in
Idyho and doin fustrate Sends me a letter ever
now and then Got three little chunks o grandchildren
out there and I never laid eyes on one
of em You see Im agittin to be quite a middle
aged manin fact a very middleaged man you
might say Sence mother died which has ben
lemmeseemothers ben dead somers in the
neighberhood o ten yearsSence mother died Ive
ben agittin more and more o MARTHYS notion
that isyou couldnt ever hire ME to marry nobody
and them has allus ben and still is the Nesteggs
views Listen Thats her acallin fer us now You must sort
o overlook the freedom but I told
Marthy youd promised to take dinner with us to
day and it ud never do to disappoint her now
Come on And ah it would have made the soul
of you either rapturously glad or madly envious to
see how meekly I consented

I am always thinking that I never tasted coffee
till that day I am always thinking of the crisp and
steaming rolls ored over with the molten gold
that hinted of the cloverfields and the bees that
had not yet permitted the honey of the bloom and
the white blood of the stalk to be divorced I am
thinking that the young and tender pullet we happy
three discussed was a near and dear relative of the
gay patrician rooster that I first caught peering so
inquisitively in at the kitchen door and I am
alwaysalways thinking of The Nestegg



THE BOY FROM ZEENY

His advent in our little country town was at
once abrupt and novel Why he came when
he came or how he came we boys never knew My
first remembrance of him is of his sudden appearance
in the midst of a game of Antnyover in
which a dozen boys besides myself were most
enthusiastically engaged The scene of the exciting
contest was the center of the main street of the
town the elevation over which we tossed the ball
being the skeleton remains of a grand triumphal
arch left as a sort of cadaverous reminder of some
recent political demonstration Although I recall
the boys external appearance upon that occasion
with some vagueness I vividly remember that his
trousers were much too large and long and that
his heavy flapping coat was buttonless and very
badly worn and damaged at the sleeves and elbows
I remember too with even more distinctness the
hat he wore it was a high silk bellcrowned hat
a mans hat and a veritable plugnot a new and
shiny plug by any means but still of dignity and
gloss enough to furnish a noticeable contrast to the
other appurtenances of its wearers wardrobe In
fact it was through this latter article of dress that the
general attention of the crowd came at last to
be drawn particularly to its unfortunate possessor
who evidently directed by an oldtime instinct had
mechanically thrust the inverted castor under a
falling ball and the ball being made of yarn
wrapped tightly over a green walnut and dropping
from an uncommon height had gone through the
hat like a round shot

Naturally enough much merriment was occasioned
by the singular mishap and the victim of
the odd occurrence seemed himself inclined to join
in the boisterous laughter and make the most of
his ridiculous misfortune He pulled the hat back
over his tousled head and with the flapping crown
of it still clinging by one frayed hinge he capered
through a grotesquely executed jig that made the
clamorous crowd about him howl again

Wo what a hat cried Billy Kinzey derisively
and with a palpably rancorous twinge of envy in
his heart for Billy was the bad boy of our town
and would doubtless have enjoyed the strange boys
sudden notoriety in thus being able to convert
disaster into positive fun Wo what a hat
reiterated Billy making a feint to knock it from the
boys head as the still capering figure pirouetted
past him

The boys eye caught the motion and he whirled
suddenly in a backward course and danced past his
reviler again this time much nearer than before
Better try it he said in a low halflaughing
tone that no one heard but Billy and myself He
was out of range in an instant still laughing as he
went

Durn him said Billy with stifling anger
clutching his fist and leaving one knuckle protruding
in a very wickedlooking mannerDurn him He
better not sass me Hes afeard to come past here
agin and say that Ill knock his durn ole stove
pipe in the middle o nex week

You will hey queried a revolving voice as
the boy twirled past againthis time so near that
Billy felt his taunting breath blown in his face

Yes I will hey said Billy viciously and
with a sidesweeping flathanded lick that sounded
like striking a rusty sheet of tin the crownless
plug went spinning into the gutter while as
suddenly the assaulted little stranger with a peculiarly
pallid smile about his lips and an electric glitter
in his eye adroitly flung his left hand forward
smiting his insulter such a blow in the region of the
brow that the unguarded Billy went tumbling
backward his plucky assailant prancing wildly
around his prostrate form

Oh come and see me snarled the strange boy
in a contemptuous tone cocking his fists up in a
scientific manner and dropping into a stoop
shouldered swagger that would have driven envy into
the heart of a bullying hackdriver Git the bloke
on his pins he sneered turning to the crowd
Spose Im goin to hit a man wen hes down

But his antagonist needed no such assistance
Stung with his unlookedfor downfall bleeding
from the first blow ever given him by mortal boy
and goaded to absolute frenzy by the taunts of his
swaggering enemy Billy sprang to his feet and a
moment later had succeeded in closing with the
boy in a roughandtumble fight in which his
adversary was at a disadvantage being considerably
smaller hampered too with his loose unbuttoned
coat and baggy trousers But for all that he did
some very efficient work in the way of a deft and
telling blow or two upon the nose of his overpowering
foe who sat astride his wriggling body but
wholly unable to get in a lick

Durn you said Billy with his hand gripping
the boys throat holler nough

Holler nothin gurgled the boy with his eyes
fairly starting from his head

Oh let him up Billy called a compassionate
voice from the excited crowd

Holler nough and I will said Billy in a tragic
whisper in the boys ear Durn ye holler Calfrope 

The boy only shook his head trembled convulsively
let fall his eyelids and lay limp and to all
appearances unconscious

The startled Billy loosed his hold rose halfway
to his feet then fiercely pounced again at his rival

But it was too lateThe ruse had succeeded
and the boy was once more on his feet

You fight like a dog said the strange boy in
a tone of infinite contemptand you AIR a dog
Put up yer props like a man and come at me and
Ill meller yer head till yer mother wont know
you Come on I dare you

This time as Billy started forward at the
challenge I regret to say that in his passion he snatched
up from the street a broken buggyspoke before
which warlike weapon the strange boy was forced
warily to retreat Step by step he gave way and
step by step his threatening foe advanced I think
perhaps part of the strange boys purpose in thus
retreating was to arm himself with one of the ax
handles that protruded from a churn standing in
front of a grocery toward which he slowly backed
across the sidewalk However that may be it is
evident he took no note of an open cellarway that
lay behind him over the brink of which he deliberately
backed throwing up his hands as he disappeared

We heard a heavy fall but heard no cry Some
loungers in the grocery attracted by the clamor of
the throng without came to the door inquiringly
one man learning what had happened peered down
the stairway of the cellar and called to ask the boy
if he was hurt which query was answered an instant
later by the appearance of the boy himself his face
far whiter than his shirt and his lips trembling
but his teeth clenched

Guess I broke my arm agin he said briefly as
the man leaned over and helped him up the steps
the boy sweeping his keen eyes searchingly over the
faces of the crowd Its the RIGHT arm though
he continued glancing at the injured member dangling
helplessly at his sideTHISUNS all right yet
and as he spoke he jerked from the mans assistance
wheeled round and an instant later as a
buggyspoke went hurtling through the air he
slapped the bewildered face of Billy with his open
hand Dam coward he said

Then the man caught him and drew him back
and the crowd closed in between the combatants
following as the boy with the broken arm was
hurried down street to the doctors office where the
door was immediately closed on the rabble and all
the mystery withinnot an utter mystery either
for three or four enterprising and sagacious boys
slipped off from the crowd that thronged in front
and climbing by a roundabout way and over a high
board fence into the back yard secretly posted
themselves at the blinded window in the rear of the little
oneroomed office and breathlessly awaited news
from within

They got him laid out on the settee whispered
a venturous boy who had leaned a board against
the windowsill and climbed into a position
commanding the enviable advantage of a broken window
pane I kin see him through a hole in the
curtain Keep still

They got his coat off and his sleeve rolled up
whispered the boy in continuationand the doctors
agivin him some medicine in a tumbler Now
hes apullin his arm Geemunnee I kin hear the
bones crunch

Haint he acryin queried a milkfaced boy
with very large blue eyes and fine white hair and
a grieved expression as he spokeHaint he
acryin

Well he haint said the boy in the window
with unconscious admiration Listen

I heerd him thist tell em at it wasnt the first
time his arm was broke Now keep still and
the boy in the window again bent his ear to the
broken pane

He says both his arms ben broke continued
the boy in the windowsays thisun ats broke
nows ben broke two times fore this time

Doggone haint he a funny feller said the
milkfaced boy with his big eyes lifted wistfully
to the boy in the window

He says onct his pap broke his arm wen he was
whippin him whispered the boy in the window

Bet his pas a wicked man said the milkfaced
boy in a dreamy speculative wayspect hes a
drunkard er somepin

Keep still said the boy at the window theyre
tryin to git him to tell his paps name and his and
he wont do it cause he says his pap comes and
steals him ever time he finds out where he is

The milkfaced boy drew a long quavering
breath and gazed suspiciously round the high board
fence of the enclosure

He says his pap used to keep a libertystable
in Zeenyin Ohio somersbut he daresnt stay
round THERE no more cause he broke up there and
had to skedaddle er theyd clean him out He says
he haint got no mother ner no brothers ner no
sisters ner no nothinony the boy in the window
added with a very dry and painful swallow he
says he haint got nothin ony thist the clothes on
his back

Yes and I bet broke in the milkfaced boy
abruptly with his thin lips compressed and his
big eyes fixed on spaceyes and I bet he kin lick
Billy Kinzey ef his arm IS broke

At this juncture some one inside coming to raise
the window the boy at the broken pane leaped to
the ground and flocking at his heels his frightened
comrades bobbed one by one over the horizon of the
high fence and were gone in an instant

So it was the hero of this sketch came to be
known as The Boy from Zeeny

The Boy from Zeeny though evidently predisposed
to novel and disastrous happenings for once
at least had come upon a streak of better fortune
for the doctor it appeared had someway taken a
fancy to him and had offered him an asylum at
his own home and hearththe compensation stipulated
and suggested by the boy himself being a
conscientious and efficient service in the doctors
stable Even with his broken arm splinted and
bandaged and supported in a sling The Boy from
Zeeny could daily be seen loping the doctors spirited
horse up the back alley from the stable to the office
with the utter confidence and careless grace
of a Bedouin When at last the injured arm was
wholly well again the daring feats of horsemanship
of which the boy was capable were listened to with
incredulity by the good boys of the village school
who never played hooky on long summer afternoons
and in consequence never had a chance of
witnessing The Boy from Zeeny loping up to the
swimminhole a mile from town barebacked
with nothing but a halter and his face turned
toward the horses tail In fact The Boy from
Zeeny displayed such a versatility of accomplishments
and those too of a character but faintly
represented in the average boy of the country town
that for all the admiration their possessor evoked
an equal envy was aroused in many a youthful
breast

The boys in this towns down on you said
a crosseyed freckledfaced boy one day to The
Boy from Zeeny

The Boy from Zeeny was sitting in the alley
window of the hayloft of the doctors stable and
the crosseyed boy had paused below and with his
nowardlooking eyes upturned stood waiting the
effect of this intelligence

What do I care for the boys in this town said
The Boy from Zeeny

The boys in this town repeated the crosseyed
boy with a slow prophetic flourish of his head
the boys in this town says cause you come from
Zeeny and blacked Billy Kinzeys eye at you think
youre goin to run things round here And youll
find out you aint the bosst o this town and the
crosseyed boy shook his head again with dire foreboding

Looky here Cocky said The Boy from Zeeny
trying to focus a direct gaze on the boys delusive
eyes wy dont you talk straight out from the
shoulder I reckon the boys in this town as you
call em didnt send YOU round here to tell me what
THEY was goin to do But ef you want to take it
up fer em and got any sand to back you jest say it
and Ill come down there and knock them durn
twisted eyes o yourn straight agin

Yes you will muttered the crosseyed boy
with dubious articulation glancing uneasily up the
alley

What growled The Boy from Zeeny thrusting
one dangling leg farther out the window supporting
his weight by the palms of his hands and poised as
though about to springwhat id you say

Didnt say nothin said the crosseyed boy
feebly and then as a sudden and most bewildering
smile lighted up his defective eyes he exclaimed
Oh I tell you what les do Les me and you
git up a show in your stable and dont let none o
the other boys be in it I kin turn a handspring
like you and purt nigh walk on my hands and
you kin pform on the slackropeand spraddle
out like the injarubber manand hold a pitch
fork on yer chinand stand up on a horse ithout
aholdinandandOh everthing And as the
crosseyed boy breathlessly concluded this list of
strong attractions he had The Boy from Zeeny so
thoroughly inoculated with the enterprise that he
warmly closed with the proposition and the preparations
and the practise for the show were at once
inaugurated

Three hours later an extremely crosseyed boy
with the freckles of his face thrown into vivid relief
by an intense pallor rushed pantingly into the
doctors office with the fateful intelligence that The
Boy from Zeeny had fell and broke his arm agin
And this time as it seemed the hapless boy had
surpassed the seriousness of all former fractures
this last being of a compound nature and very
painful in the setting and tedious in recovery the
recovery too being anything but perfect since it
left the movement of the elbow somewhat restricted
and threw the little fellows arm into an unnatural
position with the palm of the hand turned forward
as he walked But for all that the use of it was
to all appearances little impaired

Doubtless it was through such interludes from
rough service as these accidents afforded that The
Boy from Zeeny had acquired the meager education
he possessed The doctors wife who had from the
first been kind to him grew to like him very much
Through her gentle and considerate interest he was
stimulated to study by the occasional present of a
simple volume Oftentimes the good woman would
devote an hour to his instruction in the mysteries of
the books orthography and rhetoric

Nor was The Boy from Zeeny a dull pupil nor
was he an ungrateful one He was quick to learn
and never prouder than when a mastered lesson
gained for him the approbation of his patient instructor

The history of The Boy from Zeeny such as had
been gathered by the doctor and his wife was
corroborative in outline with the brief hint of it
communicated to the curious listeners at the rear
window of the doctors office on the memorable day
of the boys first appearance in the town He was
without family save a harsh unfeeling father who
from every evidence must have neglected and
abused the child most shamefully the circumstantial
proof of this fact being evidenced in the boys
frank acknowledgment that he had repeatedly run
away from him and his still firm resolve to keep
his name a secret lest he might thereby be traced
to his present security and fall once more into the
hands of his unnatural parent

Certain it was that the feelings of all who knew
the lads story showed hearty sympathy with him
and when one morning it was rumored that The Boy
from Zeeny had mysteriously disappeared and the
rumor rapidly developed into an unquestionable
fact there was a universal sense of regret in the
little town which in turn resolved itself into positive
indignation when it was learned from the doctor
that an explanation printed in red keel on the
back of a fragment of circusposter had been
found folded and tucked away an the bucklestrap
of his horses bridle The somewhat remarkable
communication in sprawling capitals ran thus


PAPS GOT ME AGIN I HAF TO GO DAM HIM DOC TEL
HER TO KEEP MY BOOCKS GOOD BY I FED OLE CHARLY I
FED HIM OTES AND HA AN CORN HE WONT NEED NO MORE FER
A WEAK AN BRAND TO DOC TEL HER GOOD BY


It was a curious bit of compositionuncouth
assuredly and marred maybe with an unpardonable
profanitybut it served In the silence and gloom
of the old stable the doctors fingers trembled as
he read and the good wifes eyes peering anxiously
above his heaving shoulder filled and overflowed
with tears

I wish that it were in the veracious sequence of
this simple history to give this wayward boy back
to the hearts that loved him and that still in memory
enshrine him with affectionate regard but the
hapless ladthe little ragged twelveyearold that
wandered out of nowhere into town and wandered
into nowhere out againnever returned Yet we
who knew him in those old dayswe who were
children with him and in spite of boyish jealousy
and petty bickerings admired the gallant spirit of
the ladare continually meeting with reminders of
him the last instance of which in my own experience
I can not refrain from offering here

For years I have been a wanderer from the dear
old town of my nativity but through all my
wanderings a gracious fate has always kept me somewhere
in its pleasant neighborhood and in consequence
I often pay brief visits to the scenes of my
longvanished boyhood It was during such a visit
but a few short years ago that remembrances of
my lost youth were most forcibly recalled by the
progress of the county fair which institution I
was permitted to attend through the kindness of an
old chum who drove me over in his buggy

Although it was not the day for racing we found
the track surrounded by a dense crowd of clamorous
and applauding people

What does it mean I asked my friend as he
guided his horse in and out among the trees toward
the edge of the enclosure

Its Professor Andrus I suspect he answered
rising in the buggy as he spoke and peering eagerly
above the heads of the surging multitude

And whos Professor Andrus I asked striking
a match against the tire of the now stationary buggy
wheel and lighting the stump of my cigar

Why havent you heard of the famous Professor
he answered laughinglyimmediately adding
in a serious tone Professor Andrus is the famous
horsetamer who has been driving the country
absolutely wild here for two or three days Stand up
here where you can see he went on excitedly

Yonder he comes Isnt that splendid

And it was

Across the sea of heads and facing toward us
down the track I caught sight of a glossy span of
horses that in their perfect beauty of symmetry
high heads and tossing manes looked as though
they were just prancing out of some Arabian dream
The animals seemed nude of rein or harness save
only a jeweled strap that crossed the breast of each
together with a slender trace at either side connecting
with a jaunty little phaeton whose glittering
wheels slivered the sunshine into splinters as they
spun Upon the narrow seat of the airy vehicle sat
the driver No lines were wound about his hands
no shout or lash to goad the horses to their telling
speed They were simply directed and controlled
by the graceful motions of a long and slender whip
which waved slowly to and fro above their heads
The great crowd cheered the master as he came He
arose deliberately took off his hat and bowed The
applause was deafening Still standing he whizzed
past us and was gone But something in the manner
of the handsome fellow struck me with a strange
sense of familiarity Was it the utter disregard of
fear that I saw on his face Was it the keenness
of the eye and the perfect selfpossession of the
man Or was itwas it the peculiar way in which
the right arm had dropped to his side after his
salute to us while curving past us and did I fancy
for that reason that the palm of his hand turned
forward as he stood

Clear the track there came a far voice across
the ringDont cross there in Gods name Drive
back

The warning evidently came too late There was
an instants breathless silence then a faraway pent
sounding clash then utter havoc in the crowd The
ropes about the ring were broken over and a tumultuous
tide of people poured across the ring myself
borne on the very foremost wave

Jest the buggy smashed thats all cried a voice
The hosses haint hurtner the man

The man referred to was the Professor I caught
a glimpse of him as he rose from the grassy bank
where he had been flung He was very pale but
calm An uncouth man brought him his silk hat
from where it had rolled in the dust

Wish youd just take this handkerchief and
brush it off said the Professor I guess Ive broke
my arm

It was The Boy from Zeeny



WHERE IS MARY ALICE SMITH

WhereisMaryAliceSmith Oh
shehasgonehome It was the thin
mysterious voice of little Mary Alice Smith herself
that so often queried and responded as above
every word accented with a sweet and eery intonation
and a very gaiety of solemn earnestness that
baffled the cunning skill of all childish imitators A
slender wisp of a girl she was not more than ten
years in appearance though her age had been
given to us as fourteen The spindle ankles that
she so airily flourished from the sparse concealment
of a worn and shadowy calico skirt seemed scarce
a fraction more in girth than the slim blueveined
wrists she tossed among the loose and ragged tresses
of her yellow hair as she danced around the room
She was from the first an object of curious and
most refreshing interest to our familyto us children
in particularan interest though years and
years have interposed to shroud it in the dull dust
of forgetfulness that still remains vivid and bright
and beautiful Whether an orphan child only or
with a father that could thus lightly send her adrift
I do not know now nor do I care to ask but I do
recall distinctly that on a raw bleak day in early
winter she was brought to us from a wild country settlement by
a reputed unclea gaunt round
shouldered man with deep eyes and sallow cheeks
and weedylooking beard as we curiously watched
him from the front window stolidly swinging this
little bluelipped rednosed waif over the muddy
wagonwheel to fathers arms like so much country
produce And even as the man resumed his seat
upon the thick board laid across the wagon and
sat chewing a straw with spasmodic noddings of
the head as some brief further conference detained
him I remember mother quickly lifting my sister
up from where we stood folding and holding the
little form in unconscious counterpart of father and
the little girl without And how we gathered round
her when father brought her in and mother fixed
a cozy chair for her close to the blazing fire and
untied the little summer hat with its hectic
trimmings together with the dismal green veil that had
been bound beneath it round the little tingling ears
The hollow pale blue eyes of the child followed
every motion with an alertness that suggested a
somewhat suspicious mind

Dave gimme that she said her eyes proudly
following the hat as mother laid it on the pillow of
the bed Mustnt git it mussed up sir er youll
have Dave in yer wool she continued warningly
as our childish interest drew us to a nearer view of
the gaudy article in question

Half awed we shrank back to our first wonderment
one of us however with the bravery to ask
Whos Dave

Whos Dave reiterated the little voice half
scornfullyWy Daves a great big boy Dave
works on Barness place And he kin purt nigh
make a full hand too Daves purt nigh tall as
your pap Hes purt nigh growed upDave is
AndDavidMasonJeffries she continued
jauntily teetering her head from left to right and
for the first time introducing that peculiar deliberation
of accent and undulating utterance that we
afterward found to be her quaintest and most
charming characteristicandDavidMason
JeffrieshelikesMaryAliceSmith And
then she broke abruptly into the merriest laughter
and clapped her little palms together till they fairly
glowed

And whos Mary Alice Smith clamored a
chorus of merry voices

The elfish figure straightened haughtily in the
chair Folding the slender arms tightly across her
breast and tilting her wan face back with an
imperious air she exclaimed sententiously Wy
Mary Alice Smith is methats who Mary Alice
Smith is

It was not long however before her usual bright
and infectious humor was restored and we were
soon piloting the little stranger here and there about
the house and laughing at the thousand funny little
things she said and did The winding stairway in
the hall quite dazed her with delight Up and down
she went a hundred times it seemed And she
would talk and whisper to herself and oftentimes
would stop and nestle down and rest her pleased
face close against the steps and pat one softly with
her slender hand peering curiously down at us
with halfaverted eyes And she counted them and
named them every one as she went up and down

Im mighty glad Im come to live in thishere
house she said

We asked her why

Oh cause she said starting up the stairs again
by an entirely novel and original method of her
own cause Uncle Tomps ner Aunt Lizabeth
dont live here and when they ever come here to
git their dinners like they will ef you dont watch
out wy then I kin slip out here on thesehere
stairs and play like I was climbin up to the Good
World where my mother isthats why

Then we hushed our laughter and asked her
where her home was and what it was like and
why she didnt like her Uncle Tomps and Aunt
Lizabeth and if she wouldnt want to visit them
sometimes

Oh yes she artlessly answered in reply to the
concluding query Ill want to go back there lots
o times but not to see them Illonlygoback
theretoseeand here she was holding up
the little flaredout fingers of her left hand and
with the index finger of the right touching their
pink tips in ordered notation with the accent of
every gleeful wordIllonlygobackthere
toseeDavidMasonJeffriescausehes
theboyferme And then she clapped her
hands again and laughed in that halfhysterical half
musical way of hers till we all joined in and made
the echoes of the old hall ring again And then
she went on suddenly throwing out an imperative
gesture of silenceand then after Ive been in this
here house a long long time and you all gits sos
you like me awfulawfulawful well then some
day youll go in that room thereand that room
thereand in the kitchenand out on the porch
and down the cellarand out in the smokehouse
and the woodhouseand the loftand all around
oh ever placeand in hereand up the stairs
and all them rooms up thereand youll look behind
all the doorsand in all the cubboardsand under
all the bedsand then youll look sorrylike and
holler out kind o skeert and youll say Where
isMaryAliceSmith And then youll wait
and listen and hold yer breath and then somepin ll
holler back away fur off and say Ohshehas
gonehome And then everthingll be all still
agin and youll be afraid to holler any moreand
you dursnt playand you cant laugh and yer
throatll thist hurt and hurt like you been aeatin
too much calamusroot er somepin And as the
little gipsy concluded her weird prophecy with a
final flourish of her big pale eyes we glanced
furtively at one anothers awestruck faces with a
superstitious dread of a vague indefinite disaster
most certainly awaiting us around some shadowy
corner of the future Through all this speech she
had been slowly and silently groping up the winding
steps her voice growing fainter and fainter
and the littly pixy form fading and wholly vanishing
at last around the spiral banister of the upper
landing Then down to us from that alien recess
came the voice alone touched with a tone as of
wild entreaty and despair WhereisMary
AliceSmith And then a long breathless pause
in which our wideeyed group below huddled still
closer pale and mute Thenfar off and faint
and quavering with a tenderness of pathos that
dews the eyes of memory even nowcame like a
belated echo the voice all desolate Ohshehas
gonehome

What a queer girl she was and what a fascinating
influence she unconsciously exerted over us
We never tired of her presence but she deprived
of ours by the many household tasks that she herself
assumed so rigidly maintained and deftly executed
seemed always just as happy when alone as
when in our boisterous funloving company Such
resources had Mary Alice Smithsuch a wonderful
inventive fancy She could talk to herselfa
favorite amusement I might almost say a popular
amusement of hers since these monologues at times
would involve numberless characters chipping in
from manifold quarters of a wholesale discussion
and querying and exaggerating agreeing and
controverting till the dishes she was washing would
clash and clang excitedly in the general badinage
Loaded with a pyramid of glistening cups and
saucers she would improvise a gallant line of march
from the kitchen table to the pantry heading an
imaginary procession and whistling a fifetune that
would stir your blood Then she would trippingly
return rippling her rosy fingers up and down the
keys of an imaginary portable piano or stammering
flatsoled across the floor chuffing and tooting like
a locomotive And she would gravely propound to
herself the most intricate riddlesponder thoughtfully
and in silence over themhazard the most
ridiculous answers and laugh derisively at her
own affected ignorance She would guess again
and again and assume the most gleeful surprise
upon at last giving the proper answer and then
she would laugh jubilantly and mockingly scout
herself with having given out a foolriddle that
she could guess with both eyes shut

Talk about riddles she said abruptly to us
one evening after supper as we lingered watching
her clearing away the tabletalk about riddles
ittakesDavidMasonJeffriestotellriddles
Bet you dont know

 Riddlecum riddlecum right
 Where was I last Saturdy night
 The winds blowthe boughs did shake
 I saw the hole a fox did make 


Again we felt that indefinable thrill never
separate from the strange utterance suggestive always
of some dark mystery and fascinating and holding
the childish fancy in complete control

Bet you dont know thisun neether

 A hollerhearted father
 And a humpback mother
 Three black orphants
 All born together 


We were dumb

You cant guess nothin she said half pityingly
Wy thems easy as fallin off a chunk Firstuns
a man named Fox and he kilt his wife and chopped
her head off and they was a man named Wright
lived in that neighberhoodand he was agoin
homeand it was Saturdy nightand he was
acomin through the big woodsand they was a
stormand Wright he clumb a tree to git out of
the rain and while he was up there here come
along a man with a dead womanand a pickax
and a spade And he drug the dead woman under
the same tree where Mr Wright wasso ever
time it ud lightnin wy Wright he could look down
and see him adiggin a grave there to bury the
woman in So Wright he kep still tel he got her
buried all right you know and went back home
and then he clumb down and lit out fer town and
waked up the constabuland he got a supeeny and
went out to Foxs place and had him jerked up
fore the gran jury Then when Fox was in
court and wanted to know where their proof was
that he kilt his wife wy Wright he jumps up and
says that riddle to the judge and all the neighbers
that was there And so when they got it all studied
outwy they tuk old Fox out and hung him under
the same tree where he buried Mrs Fox under And
thats all o thatn and the othernI promised
DavidMasonJeffriesI wouldntnevertell
nolivinsoullesshegimmeleefer
theyguesseditouttheirownsef And
as she gave this rather ambiguous explanation of
the first riddle with the mysterious comment on the
latter in conclusion she shook her elfin tresses back
over her shoulders with a cunning toss of her head
and a glimmering twinkle of her pale bright eyes
that somewhat reminded us of the fairy godmother
in Cinderella

And Mary Alice Smith was right too in her early
prognostications regarding the visits of her Uncle
Tomps and Aunt Lizabeth Many times through
the winter they jest dropped in as Aunt Lizabeth
always expressed it to see how we was agittin on
with Mary Alice And once in court week
during a prolonged trial in which Uncle Tomps and
Aunt Lizabeth rather prominently figured they
jest dropped in on us and settled down and dwelt
with us for the longest five days and nights we
children had ever in our lives experienced Nor
was our long term of restraint from childish sports
relieved wholly by their absence since Aunt Lizabeth
had taken Mary Alice back with them saying
that a good long visit to her dear old homepore
as it waswould do the child good

And then it was that we went about the house in
moody silence the question WhereisMary
AliceSmith forever yearning at our lips for
utterance and the still belated echo in the old hall
overhead forever answering Ohshehasgone
home

It was early spring when she returned And
we were looking for her coming and knew a week
beforehand the very day she would arrivefor had
not Aunt Lizabeth sent special word by Uncle
Tomps who had come to town to do his millin and
git the latest war news not to fail to jest drop in
and tell us that they was layin off to send Mary
Alice in next Saturdy

Our little town like every other village and
metropolis throughout the country at that time was
to the children at least a scene of continuous
holiday and carnival The nations heart was
palpitating with the feverish pulse of war and already
the still halffrozen clods of the common highway
were beaten into frosty dust by the tread of marshaled
men and the shrill shriek of the fife and
the hoarse boom and jar and rattling patter of the
drums stirred every breast with something of that
rapturous insanity of which true patriots and heroes
can alone be made

But on the daywhen Mary Alice Smith was
to returnwhat was all the gallant tumult of the
town to us I remember how we ran far up
the street to welcome herfor afar off we had
recognized her elfish face and eager eyes peering
expectantly from behind the broad shoulders of a
handsome fellow mounted on a great highstepping
horse that neighed and pranced excitedly as we ran
scurrying toward them

Whooee she cried in perfect ecstasy as we
paused in breathless admiration Clearthe
trackthereoldfolksyoungfolksfer
MaryAliceSmithandDavidMasonJeffries

O what a day that was And how vain indeed
would be the attempt to detail here a tithe of its
glory or our happiness in having back with us our
dear little girl and her hysterical delight in seeing
us so warmly welcome to the full love of our childish
hearts the great strong roundfaced simple
natured DavidMasonJeffries Long and
long ago we had learned to love him as we loved
the peasant hero of some fairy tale of Christian
Andersens but now that he was with us in most
wholesome and robust verity our very souls seemed
scampering from our bodies to run to him and be
caught up and tossed and swung and dandled in
his gentle giant arms

All that long delicious morning we were with
him In his tender charge we were permitted to go
down among the tumult and the music of the
streets his round goodhumored face and big blue
eyes lit with a luster like our own And happy
little Mary Alice Smithhow proud she was of
him And how closely and how tenderly through
all that golden morning did the strong brown hand
clasp hers A hundred times at least as we promenaded
thus she swung her head back jauntily to
whisper to us in that old mysterious way of hers
that DavidMasonJeffriesandMaryAlice
Smithknewsomethingthatwecouldnt
guess But when he had returned us home and
after dinner had started down the street alone with
little Mary Alice clapping her hands after him
above the gate and laughing in a strange new voice
and with the backs of her little fluttering hands
vainly striving to blot out the big teardrops that
gathered in her eyes we vaguely guessed the secret
she and David kept That night at suppertime we
knew it fully He had enlisted

      


Among the list of killed at Rich Mountain
Virginia occurred the name of Jeffries David M
We kept it from her as long as we could At last
she knew

      


It dont seem like no year ago to me Over
and over she had said these words The face was
very pale and thin and the eyes so brightso
bright The kindly hand that smoothed away the
little sufferers hair trembled and dropped tenderly
again upon the folded ones beneath the snowy
spread

Git me out the picture again

The trembling hand lifted once more and searched
beneath the pillow

She drew the thin hands up and smiling pressed
the pictured face against her lips DavidMason
Jeffries she saidlesmeandyougo
playoutonthestairs

And ever in the empty home a voice goes
moaning on and on and Where is Mary Alice it
cries and WhereisMaryAliceSmith
And the still belated echo through the high depths
of the old hall overhead answers quaveringly back
Ohshehasgonehome But her voice
it is silent evermore

Oh where is Mary Alice Smith She taught
us how to call her thusand now she will not
answer us Have we no voice to reach her with
How sweet and pure and glad they were in those old
days as we recall the accents ringing through the
hallthe same we vainly cry to her Her fancies
were so quainther ways so full of prankish
mysteries We laughed then now upon our knees
we wring our lifted hands and gaze through streaming
tears high up the stairs she used to climb in
childish glee to call and answer eerily And now
no answer anywhere

How deft the little fingertips in every task The
hands how smooth and delicate to lull and soothe
And the strange music of her lips The very
crudeness of their speech made chaster yet the
childish thought her guileless utterance had caught
from spiritdepths beyond our reach And so her
homely name grew fair and sweet and beautiful
to hear blent with the echoes pealing clear and
vibrant up the winding stair Wherewhere is Mary
Alice Smith She taught us how to call her thus
but oh she will not answer us We have no
voice to reach her with




THE OLD MAN

Response made to the sentiment The Old Man
at a dinner of the Indianapolis Literary Club

 You are old Father William the young man said
 And your hair has become very white
 And yet you incessantly stand on your head
 Do you think at your age it is right

THE OLD MAN never grows so old as to be
come either stale juiceless or unpalatable The
older he grows the mellower and riper he becomes
His eyes may fail him his step falter and his big
mouthed shoesa world too wide for his shrunk
shankmay cluck and shuffle as he walks his
rheumatics may make great knuckles of his knees
the rusty hinges of his vertebrae may refuse
cunningly to articulate but all the same the backbone
of the old man has been timeseasoned tried and
tested and no deerskin vest was ever buttoned
round a tougher Look at the eccentric kinks and
curvings of itits abrupt depression at the base
and its rounded bulging at the shoulders but dont
laugh with the smart young man who airily observes
how fullchested the old man would be if his head
were only turned around and dont kill the young
man either until you take him out some place and
tell him that the old man got himself warped up in
that shape along about the time when everybody
had to hump himself Try to bring before the
young mans defective mental vision a dissolving
view of a good oldfashioned barnraisin and
the old man doing all the raisin  himself and
grubbin and burnin  logs and underbrush
and dreenin  at the same time and trying to coax
something besides calamus to grow in the spongy
little tract of swampland that he could stand in the
middle of and wobble and shake the whole farm
Or if you cant recall the many salient features of
the minor disadvantages under which the old man
used to labor your pliant limbs may soon overtake
him and he will smilingly tell you of trials and
privations of the early days until your anxiety about
the young man just naturally stagnates and dries
up and evaporates and blows away

In this little sideshow of existence the old man
is always worth the full price of admission He
is not only the greatest living curiosity on exhibition
but the object of the most genial solicitude and
interest to the serious observer It is even good to
look upon his vast fund of afflictions finding
prominent above them all that wholesome patience that
surpasseth understanding to dwell compassionately
upon his prodigality of aches and ailments and yet
by his pride in their wholesale possession and his
thorough resignation to the inevitable continually to
be rebuked and in part made envious of the old
mans rightoftitle situation Nature after all is
kinder than unkind to him and always has a
compensation and a soothing balm for every blow that
age may deal him And in the fading embers of
the old mans eyes there are at times swift flashes
and rekindlings of the smiles of youth and the old
artlessness about the wrinkled face that dwelt there
when his cheeks were like the pippins and his

 Red lips redder still
 Kissed by strawberries on the hill

And thus it is the children are intuitively drawn
toward him and young purefaced mothers are
forever hovering about him with just such humorings
and kindly ministrations as they bestow on
the little emperor of the household realm strapped
in his high chair at the dinnertable crying Amen
in the midst of grace and ignoring the substantials
of the groaning board and at once insisting
upon a square deal of the more temporal blessings
of jelly cake and pie And the old man has justly
earned every distinction he enjoys Therefore let
him make your hearthstone all the brighter with the
ruddy coal he drags up from it with his pipe as he
comfortably settles himself where with reminiscent
eyes he may watch the curling smoke of his tobacco
as it indolently floats and drifts and drifts
and dips at last and vanishes up the grateful flue
At such times when a fiveyearold what a haven
every boy has found between the old grandfathers
knees Look back in fancy at the faces blending
therethe old mans and the boysand with the
nimbus of the smokewreaths round the brows the
gilding of the firelight on cheek and chin and the
rapt and faroff gazings of the eyes of both why
but for the silver tinsel of the beard of one and the
dusky elflocks of the other the faces seem almost
like twins

With such a view of age one feels like whipping
up the lazy years and getting old at once In heart
and soul the old man is not oldand never will be
He is paradoxically old and that is all So it is that
he grows younger with increasing years until old
age at worst is always at a level par with youth
Who ever saw a man so old as not secretly and most
heartily to wish the veteran years upon years of
greater age And at what great age did ever any
old man pass away and leave behind no sudden
shock and no selfish hearts still to yearn after him
and grieve on unconsoled Why even in the slow
declining years of old Methuselahthe banner old
man of the universeso old that history grew
absolutely tired waiting for him to go off some place and
dieeven Methuselahs taking off must have seemed
abrupt to his immediate friends and a blow to the
general public that doubtless plunged it into the
profoundest gloom For nine hundred and sixtynine
years this durable old man had smelt the rose above
the mold and doubtless had a thousand times
been told by congratulating friends that he didnt
look a day older than nine hundred and sixtyeight
and necessarily the habit of living with him was
hard to overcome

In his later years what an oracle he must
have been and with what reverence his friends
must have looked upon the little glassyheaded
hairless man and hung upon his every utterance
And with what unerring gift of prophecy
could he foretell the long and husky droughts
of summerthe gracious rains at lastthe
milksick breeding autumn and the blighting
winter simply by the way his bones felt after a
centurys casual attack of inflammatory rheumatism
And having annually frosted his feet for some
odd centuriesboy and manwe can fancy with
what quiet delight he was wont to practise his
prognosticating facilities on the boys forecasting the
coming of the then fledgling cyclone and the gosling
blizzard and doubtless even telling the day of the
month by the way his heels itched And with what
wonderment and awe must old chronic maladies
have regarded himtackling him singly or in solid
phalanx only to drop back pantingly at last and
slink away dumfounded and abashed And with
what brazen pride the final conquering disease must
have exulted over its shameless victory But this is
pathos here and not a place for ruthless speculation
a place for asterisksnot words Peace
peace The man is dead The fever called living
is over at last The patient slumbers He takes
his rest He sleeps Come away He is the oldest
dead man in the cemetery

Whether the hardy stallfed old man of the
country or the opulent and wellgroomed old man of
the metropolis he is one in our esteem and the still
warmer affections of the children The old man
from the countryyou are always glad to see him
and hear him talk There is a breeziness of the
woods and hills and a spice of the bottomlands and
thickets in everything he says and dashes of shadow
and sunshine over the waving wheat are in all the
varying expressions of his swarthy face The grip
of his hand is a thing to bet on and the undue
loudness of his voice in greeting you is even lulling
and melodious since unconsciously it argues for the
frankness of a nature that has nothing to conceal
Very probably you are forced to smile meeting the
old man in town where he never seems at ease
and invariably apologizes in some way for his presence
saying perhaps by way of explanation Yessir
here I am in spite o myself Come in day
afore yisterdy Boys was thrashin on the place
and the beltin kept atroublin and delayin of em
and I was potterin round in the way anyhow
tel finally they sent me off to town to git some
whangluther and ribbets and while I was in
I thoughtI thought Id jest run over and see the
Jedge about that Henry County matter and as I
was knockin round the courthouse first thing I
knowed Ill be switched to death ef they didnt pop
me on the jury And here I am eatin my head off
up here at the tavern Reckon tho the countyll
stand good for my expenses Ef hit caint I kin
And with the heartiest sort of a laugh the old man
jogs along leaving you to smile till bedtime over
the happiness he has unconsciously contributed

Another instance of the old mans humor under
trying circumstances was developed but a few days
ago This old man was a German citizen of an
inundated town in the Ohio valley There was much
of the pathetic in his experience but the bravery
with which he bore his misfortunes was admirable
A year ago his little home was first invaded by the
flood and himself and wife and his sons family
were driven from it to the hills for safetybut the
old mans telling of the story can not be improved
upon It ran like this Last year ven I svwim out
fon dot leedle home off mine mit my vife unt my
son his vife unt leedle girls I dink dots der last
time gootby to dose proberty But afder der vater

vonce Unt now all I safe is my vife unt my son
his vife unt my leedle grandchilderns Else
everding is gone AlleverydingDer house goneuntuntder
morgage gone too And then the
old Teutonic face melted all over in sunshiny
smiles and turning he bent and lifted a sleepy
little girl from a pile of dirty bundles in the depot
waitingroom and went pacing up and down the
muddy floor saying things in German to the child
I thought the whole thing rather beautiful Thats
the kind of an old man who saying goodby to
his son would lean and kiss the young mans hand
as in the Dutch regions of Pennsylvania two or
three weeks ago I saw an old man do

Mark Lemon must have known intimately and
loved the genteel old man of the city when the once
famous domestic drama of Grandfather Whitehead
was conceived In the play the old mana
once prosperous merchantfinds a happy home in
the household of his soninlaw And here it is
that the gentle author has drawn at once the poem
the picture and the living proof of the old
Wordsworthian axiom The child is father to the man
The old man in his simple way and in his great
love for his wilful little grandchild is being
continually distracted from the grave sermons and
moral lessons he would read the boy As for
instance aggrievedly attacking the little fellows
neglect of his books and his inordinate tendency
toward idleness and playthe culprit in the meantime
down on the floor clumsily winding his top
the old man runs on something in this wise

Play play play Always play and no work no
study no lessons And here you are the only child
of the most indulgent parents in the worldparents
that proud as they are of you would be ten times
prouder only to see you at your book storing
your mind with useful knowledge instead of day
in day out frittering away your time over your
toys and your tops and marbles And even when
your old grandfather tries to advise you and wants
to help you and is always ready and eager to assist
you and allwhy whats it all amount to Coax
and beg and tease and plead with you and yetand
yet Mechanically kneeling as he speaks
Now thats not the way to wind your top How
many more times will I have to show you And
an instant later the old mans admonitions are
entirely forgotten and his artless naturedull now to
everything but the childish glee in which he shares
is all the sweeter and more lovable for its simplicity

And so it is Old Man that you are always
touching the very tenderest places in our hearts
unconsciously appealing to our warmest sympathies
and taking to yourself our purest love We look
upon your drooping figure and we mark your tottering
step and trembling hand yet a reliant something
in your face forbids compassion and a something
in your eye will not permit us to look sorrowfully
on you And however we may smile at your
quaint ways and oldschool oddities of manner and
of speech our merriment is ever tempered with the
gentlest reverence



THE GILDED ROLL

Nosing around in an old boxpacked away
and lost to memory for yearsan hour ago
I found a musty package of gilt paper or rather
a roll it was with the greentarnished gold of the
old sheet for the outer wrapper I picked it up
mechanically to toss it into some obscure corner
when carelessly lifting it by one end a childs tin
whistle dropped therefrom and fell tinkling on the
attic floor It lies before me on my writing table
nowand so too does the roll entire though now
a roll no longerfor my eager fingers have unrolled
the gilded covering and all its precious contents
are spread out beneath my hungry eyes

Here is a scroll of inkwritten music I dont
read music but I know the dash and swing of the
pen that rained it on the page Here is a letter
with the selfsame impulse and abandon in every
syllable and its melodyhowever sweet the other
is far more sweet to me And here are other
letters like itthreefiveand seven at least Bob
wrote them from the front and Billy kept them
for me when I went to join him Dear boy Dear
boy

Here are some cards of bristolboard Ah when
Bob came to these there were no blotches then
What faceswhat expressions The droll ridiculous
goodfornothing genius with his sad mouth
as he called it upside down laughing always
at everything at big rallies and massmeetings and
conventions county fairs and floral halls booths
watermelonwagons dancingtents the swing the
Daguerreancar the lungbarometer and the air
gun man Oh what a gifted goodfornothing boy
Bob was in those old days And heres a picture
of a girlish facea very faded photographeven
fresh from the gallery five and twenty years ago
it was a faded thing But the living facehow
bright and clear that wasfor Doc Bobs awful
name for her was a pretty girl and brilliant clever
lovable every way No wonder Bob fancied her
And you could see some hint of her jaunty loveliness
in every fairy face he drew and you could
find her happy ways and dainty tastes unconsciously
assumed in all he didthe books he readthe
poems he admired and those he wrote and ringing
clear and pure and jubilant the vibrant beauty
of her voice could clearly be defined and traced
through all his music Now theres the happy pair
of themBob and Doc Make of them just whatever
your good fancy may dictate but keep in mind
the stern relentless ways of destiny

You are not at the beginning of a novel only at
the threshold of one of a hundred experiences that
lie buried in the past and this particular one most
happily resurrected by these odds and ends found
in the gilded roll

You see dating away back the contents of this
package mainly were hastily gathered together
after a weeks visit out at the old Mills farm the
gilt paper and the whistle and the pictures they
were Billys the music pages Bobs or Docs the
letters and some other manuscripts were mine

The Mills girls were great friends of Docs and
often came to visit her in town and so Doc often
visited the Millss This is the way that Bob first
got out there and won them all and shaped the
thing for me as he would put it and lastly we
had lugged in Billysuch a handy boy you know
to hold the horses on picnic excursions and to
watch the carriage and the luncheon and all that
Yes and Bob would say such a serviceable
boy in getting all the fishing tackle in proper order
and digging bait and promenading in our wake up
and down the creek all day with the minnow
bucket hanging on his arm dont you know

But jolly as the days were I think jollier were
the long evenings at the farm After the supper in
the grove where when the weather permitted
always stood the table ankledeep in the cool green
plush of the sward and after the lounge upon the
grass and the cigars and the new fish stories and
the general invoice of the old ones it was delectable
to get back to the girls again and in the old
best room hear once more the lilt of the old
songs and the staccatoed laughter of the piano
mingling with the alto and falsetto voices of the Mills
girls and the gallant soprano of the dear girl Doc

This is the scene I want you to look in upon
as in fancy I do nowand here are the materials
for it all husked from the gilded roll

Bob the master leans at the piano now and Doc
is at the keys her glad face often thrown up side
wise toward his own His face is boyishfor there
is yet but the ghost of a mustache upon his lip
His eyes are dark and clear of oversize when looking
at you but now their lids are drooped above
his violin whose melody has for the time almost
smoothed away the upward kinkings of the corners
of his mouth And wonderfully quiet now
is every one and the chords of the piano too are
low and faltering and so at last the tune itself
swoons into the universal hush andBob is rasping
in its stead the ridiculous but marvelously
perfect imitation of the priming of a pump while
Billys hands forget the chiggers on the bare
backs of his feet as with clapping palms he dances
round the room in ungovernable spasms of delight
And then we all laugh and Billy taking advantage
of the general tumult pulls Bobs head down and
whispers Git em to stay up way late tonight
And Bob perhaps remembering that we go back
home tomorrow winks at the little fellow and whispers
You let me manage em Stay up till broad
daylight if we take a notioneh And Billy
dances off again in newer glee while the inspired
musician is plunking a banjo imitation on his
enchanted instrument which is unceremoniously
drowned out by a circustune from Doc that is
absolutely inspiring to every one but the barefooted
brother who drops back listlessly to his old position
on the floor and sullenly renews operations on
his chigger claims

Thought you was goin to have popcorn tonight
all so fast he says doggedly in the midst of a
momentary lull that has fallen on a game of whist
And then the oldest Mills girl who thinks cards stupid
anyhow says Thats so Billy and were going
to have it too and right away for this games
just ending and I shant submit to being bored with
another I say popcorn with Billy And after
that she continues rising and addressing the party
in general we must have another literary and
artistic tournament and thats been in contemplation
and preparation long enough so you gentlemen can
be pulling your wits together for the exercises while
us girls see to the refreshments

Have you done anything toward it queries
Bob when the girls are gone with the alert Billy in
their wake

Just an outline I reply How with you

Clean forgot itthat is the preparation but Ive
got a little old secondhand idea if youll all help me
out with it thatll amuse us some and tickle Billy
Im certain

So thats agreed upon and while Bob produces
his portfolio drawing paper pencils and so on I
turn to my notebook in a dazed way and begin
counting my fingers in a depth of profound abstraction
from which I am barely aroused by the reappearance
of the girls and Billy

Goody goody goody Bobs goin to make
pictures cries Billy in additional transport to that
the cake popcorn had produced

Now you girls says Bob gently detaching the
affectionate Billy from one leg and moving a chair
to the table with a backward glance of intelligence
toward the boyyou girls are to help us all you
can and we can all work but as Ill have all the
illustrations to do I want you to do as many of
the verses as you canthatll be easy you know
because the work entire is just to consist of a series
of foolepigrams such as for instancelisten
Billy

 Here lies a young man
 Who in childhood began
 To swear and to smoke and to drink
 In his twentieth year
 He quit swearing and beer
 And yet is still smoking I think


And the rest of his instructions are delivered in
lower tones that the boy may not hear and then all
matters seemingly arranged he turns to the boy with
And now Billy no lookin over shoulders you
know or swinging on my chairback while Im at
work When the pictures are all finished then you
can take a squint at em and not before Is that all
hunky now

Oh whos agoin to look over your shoulder
only DOC And as the radiant Doc hastily quits
that very post and dives for the offending brother
he scrambles under the piano and laughs derisively

And then a silence falls upon the groupa
gracious quiet only intruded upon by the very juicy
and exuberant munching of an apple from a remote
fastness of the room and the occasional thumping
of a bare heel against the floor

At last I close my notebook with a half slam

That means says Bob laying down his pencil
and addressing the girlsthat means hes
concluded his poem and that hes not pleased with it
in any manner and that he intends declining to read
it for that selfacknowledged reason and that he
expects us to believe every affected word of his
entire speech

Oh dont I exclaim

Then give us the wretched production in all its
hideous deformity

And the girls all laugh so sympathetically and
Bob joins them so gently and yet with a tone I
know that can be changed so quickly to my further
discomfiture that I arise at once and read without
apology or excuse this primitive and very callow
poem recovered here today from the gilded roll


A BACKWARD LOOK

 As I sat smoking alone yesterday
 And lazily leaning back in my chair
 Enjoying myself in a general way
 Allowing my thoughts a holiday
 From weariness toil and care
 My fanciesdoubtless for ventilation
 Left ajar the gates of my mind
 And Memory seeing the situation
 Slipped out in the street of Auld Lang Syne

 Wandering ever with tireless feet
 Through scenes of silence and jubilee
 Of longhushed voices and faces sweet
 Were thronging the shadowy side of the street
 As far as the eye could see
 Dreaming again in anticipation
 The same old dreams of our boyhoods days
 That never come true from the vague sensation
 Of walking asleep in the worlds strange ways

 Away to the house where I was born
 And there was the selfsame clock that ticked
 From the close of dusk to the burst of morn
 When lifewarm hands plucked the golden corn
 And helped when the apples were picked
 And the chany dog on the mantelshelf
 With the gilded collar and yellow eyes
 Looked just as at first when I hugged myself
 Sound asleep with the dear surprise

 And down to the swing in the locusttree
 Where the grass was worn from the trampled ground
 And where Eck Skinner Old Carr and three
 Or four such other boys used to be
 Doin skyscrapers or whirlin round
 And again Bob climbed for the bluebirds nest
 And again had shows in the buggyshed
 Of Guymons barn where still unguessed
 The old ghosts romp through the best days dead

 And again I gazed from the old schoolroom
 With a wistful look of a long June day
 When on my cheek was the hectic bloom
 Caught of Mischief as I presume
 He had such a partial way
 It seemed toward meAnd again I thought
 Of a probable likelihood to be
 Kept in after schoolfor a girl was caught
 Catching a note from me

 And down through the woods to the swimminghole
 Where the big white hollow old sycamore grows
 And we never cared when the water was cold
 And always ducked the boy that told
 On the fellow that tied the clothes
 When life went so like a dreamy rhyme
 That it seems to me now that then
 The world was having a jollier time
 Than it ever will have again


The crude production is received I am glad to
note with some expressions of favor from the company
though Bob of course must heartlessly dissipate
my weak delight by saying Well its certainly
bad enough though he goes on with an air
of deepest critical sagacity and fairness considered
as it should be justly as the production of a
jourpoet why it might be worsethat is a little
worse

Probably I remember sayingprobably I
might redeem myself by reading you this little
amateurish bit of verse enclosed to me in a letter by
mistake not very long ago I here fish an envelope
from my pocket the address of which all recognize
as in Bobs almost printed writing He smiles
vacantly at itthen vividly colors

What date he stoically asks

The date I suggestively answer of your last
letter to our dear Doc at boardingschool two days
exactly in advance of her coming homethis veritable
visit now

Both Bob and Doc rush at mebut too late The
letter and contents have wholly vanished The
youngest Miss Mills quiets usurgently distracting
us in fact by calling our attention to the immediate
completion of our joint production For now she
says with our new reinforcement we can with
becoming diligence soon have it ready for both printer
and engraver and then well wake up the boy who
has been fortunately slumbering for the last quarter
of an hour and present to him as designed and
intended this matchless creation of our united
intellects At the conclusion of this speech we all go
goodhumoredly to work and at the close of half an
hour the tedious but most ridiculous task is
announced completed

As I arrange and place in proper form here on the
table the separate cardstwentyseven in number
I sigh to think that I am unable to transcribe for
you the best part of the nonsensical workthe
illustrations All I can give is the written copy of


BILLYS ALPHABETICAL ANIMAL SHOW

 A WAS an elegant Ape
 Who tied up his ears with red tape
 And wore a long veil
 Half revealing his tail
 Which was trimmed with jet bugles and crape

 B was a boastful old Bear
 Who used to sayHoomh I declare
 I can eatif youll get me

 Ten babies teeth toenails and hair

 When snatched from the home of his pride

 As eighteen or twenty
 And that was quite all that she needed

 G was a gluttonous Goat
 Who dining one day table dhote
 Ordered soupbone au fait
 And fish papiermache
 And a filet of Spring overcoat

 H was a highcultured Hound
 Who could clear forty feet at a bound
 And a coon once averred
 That his howl could be heard
 For five miles and threequarters around

 I was an Ibex ambitious
 To dive over chasms auspicious
 He would leap down a peak
 And not light for a week
 And swear that the jump was delicious

 J was a Jackass who said
 He had such a bad cold in his head
 If it wasnt for leaving
 The rest of us grieving
 Hed really rather be dead

 K was a profligate Kite
 Who would haunt the saloons every night
 And often he ust
 To reel back to his roost
 Too full to set up on it right

 I thinks ef you happen
 To ketch me anappin
 Im ready to set up the drinks

 M was a merry old Mole
 Who would snooze all the day in his hole
 Thenall night arootin

Like oysters theyll serve us

 And barrel and pickle and bottle us

 O was an autocrat Owl
 Such a wisesuch a wonderful fowl
 Why for all the night through
 He would hoot and hoohoo

 And there he had lodgings to let

 Q was a querulous Quail
 Who said It will little avail
 The efforts of those

 To attempt to put salt on my tail

 R was a ringtailed Raccoon
 With eyes of the tinge of the moon

 And the fur on his back
 A sad sort of sallow maroon

 S is a Sculpinyoull wish
 Very much to have one on your dish

 On the outside and so
 Hes a very desirable fish

 T was a Turtle of wealth
 Who went round with particular stealth
 Why said he Im afraid
 Of being waylaid
 When I even walk out for my health

 U was a Unicorn curious
 With one horn of a growth so LUXURIOUS
 He could level and stab it
 If you didnt grab it
 Clean through you he was so blamed furious

 V was a vagabond Vulture
 Who said I dont want to insult yer
 But when you intrude
 Where in lone solitude
 Im apreyin youre no man o culture

 W was a wild WOODchuck

 Green corn and tomatoes
 And tree roots and call it all GOOD chuck

 X was a kind of Xcuse
 Of somesortothing that got loose

 And cage it and tame it
 And bring it in general use

 Or a handful of lightning
 Bugs squeezed in the tightning
 Pink fist of a boy at night

 Z is the Zebra of course
 A kind of a clownofahorse
 Each other despising
 Yet neither devising
 A way to obtain a divorce

  here is the famouswhatisit

 Aint this the BEST of em
 Right at the end of your visit


At last Billy is sent off to bed It is the prudent
mandate of the old folks But so loathfully the poor
child goes Bobs heart goes tooYes Bob himself
to keep the little fellow company for a while and
up there under the old rafters in the pleasant gloom
lull him to famous dreams with fairy tales And it
is during this brief absence that the youngest Mills
girl gives us a surprise She will read a poem she
says written by a very dear friend of hers who
fortunately for us is not present to prevent her We
guard door and window as she reads Doc says she
will not listen but she does listen and cries too
out of pure vexation she asserts The rest of us
however cry just because of the apparent honesty
of the poem of


BEAUTIFUL HANDS

 O your handsthey are strangely fair
 Fairfor the jewels that sparkle there
 Fairfor the witchery of the spell
 That ivory keys alone can tell
 But when their delicate touches rest
 Here in my own do I love them best
 As I clasp with eager acquisitive spans
 My glorious treasure of beautiful hands

 Marvelouswonderfulbeautiful hands
 They can coax roses to bloom in the strands
 Of your brown tresses and ribbons will twine
 Under mysterious touches of thine
 Into such knots as entangle the soul
 And fetter the heart under such a control
 As only the strength of my love understands
 My passionate love for your beautiful hands

 As I remember the first fair touch
 Of those beautiful hands that I love so much
 I seem to thrill as I then was thrilled
 Kissing the glove that I found unfilled
 When I met your gaze and the queenly bow
 As you said to me laughingly Keep it now   
 And dazed and alone in a dream I stand
 Kissing this ghost of your beautiful hand

 When first I loved in the long ago
 And held your hand as I told you so
 Pressed and caressed it and gave it a kiss
 And said I could die for a hand like this
 Little I dreamed loves fullness yet
 Had to ripen when eyes were wet
 And prayers were vain in their wild demands
 For one warm touch of your beautiful hands

 Beautiful HandsO Beautiful Hands
 Could you reach out of the alien lands
 Where you are lingering and give me tonight
 Only a touchwere it ever so light
 My heart were soothed and my weary brain
 Would lull itself into rest again
 For there is no solace the world commands
 Like the caress of your beautiful hands

        


Violently winking at the mist that blurs my sight
I regretfully awaken to the here and now And is
it possible I sorrowfully muse that all this glory
can have fled awaythat more than twenty long
long years are spread between me and that happy
night And is it possible that all the dear old faces
Oh quit it quit it Gather the old scraps up and
wad em back into oblivion where they belong

Yes but be calmbe calm Think of cheerful
things You are not all alone BILLYS living yet

I knowand six feet highand sagshouldered
and owns a tin and stovestore and cant hear
thunder BILLY

And the youngest Mills girlshes alive too

Spose I dont know that I married her

And Doc

BOB married her Been in California for more
than fifteen yearson some blasted cattleranch or
somethingand hes worth a half a million And
am I less prosperous with this gilded roll



A WILD IRISHMAN

Not very many years ago the writer was for
some months stationed at South Bend a thriving
little city of northern Indiana Its population is
mainly on the one side of the St Joseph River but
quite a respectable fraction thereof takes its
industrial way to the opposite shore and there gains an
audience and a hearing in the rather imposing
growth and hurlyburly of its big manufactories
and the consequent rapid appearance of multitudinous
neat cottages tenement houses and business
blocks A stranger entering South Bend proper on
any ordinary day will be at some loss to account for
its prosperous appearanceits flagged and bouldered
streetsits handsome mercantile blocks banks and
business houses generally Reasoning from cause to
effect and seeing but a meager sprinkling of people
on the streets throughout the day and these seeming
for the most part merely idlers and in nowise
accessory to the evident thrift and opulence of their
surroundings the observant stranger will be puzzled
at the situation But when evening comes and the
outlying foundries sewingmachine wagon plow
and other works together with the papermills and all the
nameless industrieswhen the operations
of all these are suspended for the day and the
workmen and workwomen loosed from laborthen
as this vast army suddenly invades and overflows
bridge roadway street and lane the startled stranger
will fully comprehend the why and wherefore
of the citys high prosperity And once acquainted
with the people there the fortunate sojourner will
find no ordinary culture and intelligence and as
certainly he will meet with a social spirit and a
wholesouled heartiness that will make the place a
lasting memory The town too is the home of
many worldknown people and a host of local
celebrities the chief of which latter class I found
during my stay there in the person of Tommy Stafford
or The Wild Irishman as everybody called
him

Talk of odd fellows and eccentric characters
said Major Blowney my employer one afternoon
you must see our Wild Irishman here before you
say youve yet found the queerest brightest cleverest
chap in all your travels What dye say
Stockford And the Major paused in his work of
charging cartridges for his new breechloading shotgun
and turned to await his partners response

Stockford thus addressed paused above the
shieldsign he was lettering slowly smiling as he
dipped and trailed his pencil through the ivory black
upon a bit of broken glass and said in his deliberate
half absentminded wayIs it Tommy youre telling
him about and then with a gradual broadening
of the smile he went on Well I should say so
Tommy Whats come of the fellow anyway I
havent seen him since his last bout with the mayor
on his trial for shakin up that fasthorse man

The fasthorse man got just exactly what he
needed too said the genial Major laughing and
mopping his perspiring brow The fellow was
barkin up the wrong stump when he tackled
Tommy Got beat in the trade at his own game
you know and wound up by an insult that no Irishman
would take and Tommy just naturally wore
out the hall carpet of the old hotel with him

And then collared and led him to the mayors
office himself they say

Oh he did said the Major with a dash of
pride in the confirmation thats Tommy all over

Funny trial wasnt it continued the ruminating
Stockford

Wasnt it though laughed the Major The
porters testimony You see he was for Tommy
of course and on examination testified that the
horseman struck Tommy first And here Tommy
broke in with Hes ameanin well yer Honor but
hes lyin to yehes lyin to ye No livin man iver
struck me firstnor last nayther for the matter o
that And I thoughtthecourtwoulddie
continued the Major in a like imminent state of
merriment

Yes and he said if he struck him first
supplemented Stockford hed like to know why the
horseman was wearin all the black eyes and the
blood and the boomps on that head of um And
its that talk that got him off with so light a fine

As it always does said the Major coming to
himself abruptly and looking at his watch Stock
you say youre not going along with our duckshooting
party this time The old Kankakee is just lousy
with em this season

Cant go possibly said Stockford not on
account of the work at all but the folks aint just
as well as Id like to see them and Ill stay here till
theyre better Next time Ill try and be ready for
you Going to take Tommy of course

Of course Got to have The Wild Irishman
with us Im going around to find him now Then
turning to me the Major continued Suppose you
get on your coat and hat and come along Its the
best chance youll ever have to meet Tommy Its
late anyhow and Stockfordll get along without you
Come on

Certainly said Stockford go ahead And you
can take him ducking too if he wants to go

But he doesnt want to goand wont go
replied the Major with a commiserative glance at me
Says he doesnt know a duck from a pollparrot
nor how to load a shotgunand couldnt hit a house
if he were inside of it and the door shut Admits
that he nearly killed his uncle once on the other side
of a tree with a squirrel runnin down it Dont
want him along

When I reached the street with the genial Major
he gave me this advice Now when you meet Tommy you mustnt
take all he says for dead earnest
and you mustnt believe because he talks loud and
in italics every other word that he wants to do all
the talking and wont be interfered with Thats the
way hes apt to strike folks at firstbut its their
mistake not his Talk back to himcontrovert him
whenever hes aggressive in the utterance of his
opinions and if youre only honest in the announcement
of your own ideas and beliefs hell like you all
the better for standing by them Hes quicktempered
and perhaps a trifle sensitive so share your
greater patience with him and hell pay you back by
fighting for you at the drop of the hat In short hes
as nearly typical of his gallant countrys brave
impetuous funloving race as one man can be

But is he quarrelsome I asked

Not at all Theres the trouble If hed only
quarrel thered be no harm done Quarrelings
cheap and Tommys extravagant A big blacksmith
here the other day kicked some boy out of his
shop and Tommy on his cart happened to be passing
at the time and he just jumped off without a
word and went in and worked on that fellow for
about three minutes with such disastrous results that
they couldnt tell his shop from a slaughterhouse
paid an assault and battery fine and gave the boy a
dollar besides and the whole thing was a positive
luxury to him But I guess wed better drop the
subject for heres his cart and heres Tommy Hi
there you Fardown Irish Mick called the Major
in affected antipathy been out raiding the honest
farmers henroosts again have you

We had halted at a corner grocery and produce
store as I took it and the smoothfaced shaven
headed man in woolen shirt short vest and suspenderless
trousers so boisterously addressed by the
Major was just lifting from the back of his cart
a coop of cackling chickens

Arrah ye blasted Kerryonian replied the
handsome fellow depositing the coop on the curb
and straightening his tall slender figure I were
jist thinkin of yez and the ducks and here ye come
quackin into the prisence of ryalty wid yer canvas
back suit upon ye and the schwimskins bechuxt yer
toes How air yez anyhowand air we startin for
the Kankakee by the nixt post

Were to start just as soon as we get the boys
together said the Major shaking hands The
crowds to be at Andrews by four and its fully that
now so come on at once Well go round by Munsons
and have Hi send a boy to look after your
horse Come I want to introduce my friend
here to you and well all want to smoke and jabber
a little in appropriate seclusion Come on And
the impatient Major had linked arms with his hesitating
ally and myself and was turning the corner
of the street

Its an hours work I have yet wid the squawkers
mildly protested Tommy still hanging back
and stepping a trifle high but as one Irishman
would say til another Yere wrong but Im wid
ye 

And five minutes later the three of us had joined
a very jolly party in a snug back room with

 The chamber walls depicted all around
 With portraitures of huntsman hawk and hound
 And the hurt deer

and where as well drifted over the olfactory
intelligence a certain subtle warmbreathed aroma that
genially combated the chill and darkness of the day
without and resurrecting longdead Christmases
brimmed the grateful memory with all comfortable
cheer

A dozen hearty voices greeted the appearance of
Tommy and the Major the latter adroitly pushing
the jovial Irishman to the front with a mockheroic
introduction to the general company at the conclusion
of which Tommy with his hat tucked under
his left elbow stood bowing with a grace of pose
and presence Lord Chesterfield might have applauded

Gintlemen said Tommy settling back upon his
heels and admiringly contemplating the group
gintlemen I congratulate yez wid a pride that
shoves the thumbs o me into the arrumholes of me
weshkit At the inshtigation of the bowld OBlowney
axin the gintlemans pardonI am here wid
no silver tongue of illoquence to paralyze yez but
I am prisent as has been ripresinted to jine wid yez
in a stupendous waste of gunpowder and duck
shot and highwines and ham sandwiches upon
the silvonian banks of the ragin Kankakee where
the didipper tips ye goodby wid his tail and the
wild loon skoots like a skyrocket for his exiled
home in the alien dunes of the wild morassor as
Tommy Moore so illegantly describes the blashted
birrud

 Away to the dizhmal shwamp he spheeds
 His path is rugged and sore
 Through tangled juniper beds of reeds
 And many a fen where the serpent feeds
 And birrud niver flew before
 And niver will fly any more


if iver he arrives back safe into civilization again
and Ive been in the poultry business long enough to
know the private opinion and personal integrity of
ivery fowl that flies the air or roosts on poles But
changin the subject of my few small remarks here
and thankin yez wid an overflowin heart but a dhry
tongue I have the honor to propose gintlemen long
life and health to ivery mothers son o yez and
success to the Duckhunters of Kankakee 

The duckhunters of the Kankakee chorused
the elated party in such musical uproar that for a
full minute the voice of the enthusiastic Major
who was trying to say somethingcould not be
heard Then he said

I want to propose that themeThe Duck
hunters of the Kankakee for one of Tommys
improvisations I move we have a song now from
Tommy on The Duck Hunters of the Kankakee 

Hurrah Hurrah A song from Tommy cried
the crowd Make us up a song and put us all into
it A song from Tommy A song A song

There was a queer light in the eye of the
Irishman I observed him narrowlyexpectantly Often
I had read of this phenomenal art of improvised
balladsinging but had always remained a little
skeptical in regard to the possibility of such a feat
Even in the notable instances of this gift as
displayed by the very clever Theodore Hook I had
always half suspected some prior preparationsome
adroit forecasting of the sequence that seemed the
instant inspiration of his witty verses Here was
evidently to be a test example and I was all alert
to mark its minutest detail

The clamor had subsided and Tommy had drawn
a chair near to and directly fronting the Majors
His right hand was extended closely grasping the
right hand of his friend which he scarce perceptibly
though measuredly lifted and let fall throughout the
length of all the curious performance The voice
was not unmusical nor was the quaint old balladair
adopted by the singer unlovely in the least simply
a monotony was evident that accorded with the
levity and chancefinish of the improvisationand
that the song was improvised on the instant I am
certainthough in nowise remarkable for other
reasons in rhythmic worth or finish And while his
smiling auditors all drew nearer and leant with
parted lips to catch every syllable the words of the
strange melody trailed unhesitatingly into the line
literally as here subjoined

 One gloomy day in the airly Fall
 Whin the sunshine had no chance at all
 No chance at all for to gleam and shine
 And lighten up this heart of mine

  Twas in South Bend that famous town
 Whilst I were astrollin round and round
 I met some friends and they says to me
 Its a hunt well take on the Kankakee 


Hurrah for the Kankakee Give it to us
Tommy cried an enthusiastic voice between
verses Now give it to the Major And the song
went on

 Theres Major Blowney leads the van
 As crack a shot as an Irishman
 For its the duck is a tin decoy
 That his owld shotgun cant destroy


And a halfdozen jubilant palms patted the
Majors shoulders and his ruddy goodnatured
face beamed with delight Now give it to the rest
of em Tommy chuckled the Major And the
song continued

 And along wid Hank is Mick Maharr
 And Barney Pince at The Shamrock bar
 Theres Barney Pinch wid his heart so true
 And the Andrews Brothers theyll go too


Hold on Tommy chipped in one of the
Andrews you must give the Andrews Brothers a
better advertisement than that Turn us on a full
verse cant you

Make em pay for it if you do said the Major
in an undertone And Tommy promptly amended

 O the Andrews Brothers theyll be there
 Wid good segyars and wine to sphare
 Theyll treat us here on fine champagne
 And whin were there theyll treat us again


The applause here was vociferous and only
discontinued when a box of Havanas stood open on the
table During the momentary lull thus occasioned
I caught the Majors twinkling eyes glancing evasively
toward me as he leaned whispering some further
instructions to Tommy who again took up his
desultory ballad while I turned and fled for the
street catching however as I went and high above
the laughter of the crowd the satire of this quatrain
to its latest line

 But RRRiley hell not go I guess
 Lest hed get lost in the wilderness
 And so in the city he will shtop
 For to curl his hair in the barber shop


It was after six when I reached the hotel but I
had my hair trimmed before I went in to supper
The style of trimming adopted then I still rigidly
adhere to and call it the Tommy Stafford stubble
crop

Ten days passed before I again saw the Major
Immediately upon his returnit was late afternoon
when I heard of itI determined to take my
evening walk out the long street toward his pleasant
home and call on him there This I did and
found him in a wholesome state of fatigue slippers
and easy chair enjoying his pipe on the piazza Of
course he was overflowing with happy reminiscences
of the huntthe woodandwatercraft
boatsambushesdecoys and tramp and camp
and so on without endbut I wanted to hear him
talk of The Wild IrishmanTommy and I think
too now that the sagacious Major secretly read my
desires all the time To be utterly frank with the
reader I will admit that I not only think the Major
divined my interest in Tommy but I know he did
for at last as though reading my very thoughts he
abruptly said after a long pause in which he
knocked the ashes from his pipe and refilled and
lighted itWell all I know of The Wild Irishman
I can tell you in a very few wordsthat is
if you care at all to listen And the crafty old
Major seemed to hesitate

Go ongo on I said eagerly

About forty years ago resumed the Major
placidly in the little old unheardof town
Karnteel County Tyrone Province Ulster Ireland
Tommy Stafford was fortunate enoughdespite
the contrary opinion on that point of his wretchedly
poor parentsto be born And here again as I
advised you the other day you must be prepared for
constant surprises in the study of Tommys character

Go on I said Im prepared for anything

The Major smiled profoundly and continued

Fifteen years ago when he came to America
and the Lord only knows how he got the passage
moneyhe brought his widowed mother with him
here and has supported and is still supporting her
Besides went on the still secretly smiling Major
the fellow has actually found time through all his
adversities to pick up quite a smattering of education
here and there

Poor fellow I broke in sympathizingly what
a pity it is that he couldnt have had such advantages
earlier in life and as I recalled the broad brogue
of the fellow together with his careless dress
recognizing beneath it all the native talent and
brilliancy of a mind of most uncommon worth I could
not restrain a deep sigh of compassion and regret

The Major was leaning forward in the gathering
dusk and evidently studying my own face the
expression of which at that moment was very grave
and solemn I am sure He suddenly threw himself
backward in his chair in an uncontrollable burst of
laughter Oh I just cant keep it up any longer
he exclaimed

Keep what up I queried in a perfect maze of
bewilderment and surprise Keep what up I
repeated

Why all this twaddle farce travesty and by
play regarding Tommy You know I warned you
over and over and you mustnt blame me for the
deception I never thought youd take it so in
earnest and here the jovial Major again went into
convulsions of laughter

But I dont understand a word of it all I cried
half frenzied with the gnarl and tangle of the whole
affair What twaddle farce and byplay is it
anyhow And in my vexation I found myself on
my feet and striding nervously up and down the
paved walk that joined the street with the piazza
pausing at last and confronting the Major almost
petulantly Please explain I said controlling my
vexation with an effort

The Major arose Your striding up and down
there reminds me that a little stroll on the street
might do us both good he said Will you wait
until I get a coat and hat

He rejoined me a moment later and we passed
through the open gate and saying Lets go down
this way he took my arm and turned into a street
where cooling as the dusk was the thick maples
lining the walk seemed to throw a special shade of
tranquillity upon us

What I meant wasbegan the Major in a low
serious voiceWhat I meant wassimply this
Our friend Tommy though the truest Irishman in
the world is a man quite the opposite every way of
the character he has appeared to you All that rich
brogue of his is assumed Though he was poor as I
told you when he came here his native quickness
and his marvelous resources tact judgment business
qualitiesall have helped him to the equivalent
of a liberal education His love of the humorous
and the ridiculous is unbounded but he has serious
moments as well and at such times is as dignified
and refined in speech and manner as any man youd
find in a thousand He is a good speaker can stir
a political convention to highest excitement when he
gets fired up and can write an article for the press
that goes spang to the spot He gets into a great
many personal encounters of a rather undignified
character but they are almost invariably bred of his
innate interest in the under dog and the fire and
tow of his impetuous nature

My companion had paused here and was looking
through some printed slips in his pocketbook I
wanted you to see some of the fellows articles in
print but I have nothing of importance here only
some of his doggerel as he calls it and youve had
a sample of that But heres a bit of the upper spirit
of the manand still another that you should hear
him recite You can keep them both if you care to
The boys all fell in love with that last one
particularly hearing his rendition of it So we had a
lot printed and I have two or three left Put these
two in your pocket and read them at your leisure

But I read them there and then as eagerly too
as I append them here and now The first is
called

SAYS HE

 Whatever the weather may be says he
 Whatever the weather may be
 Its plaze if ye will an Ill say me say
 Supposin today was the winterest day
 Wud the weather be changing because ye cried
 Or the snow be grass were ye crucified
 The best is to make your own summer says he
 Whatever the weather may be says he
 Whatever the weather may be

 Whatever the weather may be says he
 Whatever the weather may be
 Its the songs ye sing an the smiles ye wear
 Thats amakin the sun shine everywhere
 An the world of gloom is a world of glee
 Wid the bird in the bush an the bud in the tree
 An the fruit on the stim of the bough says he
 Whatever the weather may be says he
 Whatever the weather may be

 Whatever the weather may be says he
 Whatever the weather may be
 Ye can bring the Spring wid its green an gold
 An the grass in the grove where the snow lies cold
 An yell warm yer back wid a smiling face
 As ye sit at yer heart like an owld fireplace
 An toast the toes o yer sowl says he
 Whatever the weather may be says he
 Whatever the weather may be


Now said the Major peering eagerly above my
shoulder go on with the next To my mind it is
even better than the first A type of character youll
recognizeThe same broth of a boy only
AMERICANIZED dont you know

And I read the scrap entitled

CHAIRLEY BURKE

 Its Chairley Burkes in town bys Hes down til Jamesys
Place

 O dhrivin all the throubles aff these dhark an ghloomy days
 Ohone that its meself wid all the graifs I have to dhrown
 Must lave me pick to resht a bit sence Chairley Burkes in
town


Before we turn back now said the smiling
Major as I stood lingering over the indefinable
humor of the last refrain before we turn back I
want to show you something eminently characteristic
Come this way a halfdozen steps

As he spoke I looked up first to observe that we
had paused before a handsome square brick residence
centering a beautiful smooth lawn its emerald
only littered with the light gold of the earliest
autumn leaves On either side of the trim walk
that led up from the gate to the carved stone
ballusters of the broad piazza with its empty easy
chairs were graceful vases frothing over with
late blossoms and wreathed with laurellooking
vines and luxuriantly lacing the border of the
pave that turned the farther corner of the house
blue white and crimson pink and violet went
fading away in perspective as my gaze followed the
gesture of the Majors

Here come a little farther Now do you see
that man there

Yes I could make out a figure in the deepening
duskthe figure of a man on the back stoopa
tiredlooking man in his shirtsleeves who sat upon
a low chairno not a chairan empty box He
was leaning forward with his elbows on his knees
and the hands dropped limp He was smoking
too I could barely see his pipe and but for the
odor of very strong tobacco would not have known
he had a pipe Why does the master of the house
permit his servants so to desecrate this beautiful
home I thought

Well shall we go now said the Major

I turned silently and we retraced our steps I
think neither of us spoke for the distance of a
square

Guess you didnt know the man there on the
back porch said the Major

No why I asked dubiously

I hardly thought you would and besides the
poor fellows tired and it was best not to disturb
him said the Major

Why who was itsome one I know

It was Tommy

Oh said I inquiringly hes employed there in
some capacity

Yes as master of the house

You dont mean it

I certainly do He owns it and made every
cent of the money that paid for it said the Major
proudly Thats why I wanted you particularly
to note that eminent characteristic I spoke of
Tommy could just as well be sitting with a fine
cigar on the front piazza in an easy chair as with
his dhudeen on the back porch on an empty box
where every night youll find him Its the
unconscious dropping back into the old ways of his
father and his fathers father and his fathers
fathers father In brief he sits there the poor
lorn symbol of the long oppression of his race




MRS MILLER

JOHN B McKINNEY Attorney and Counselor
at Law as his sign read was for many reasons
a fortunate man For many other reasons he was
not He was chiefly fortunate in being as certain
opponents often strove witheringly to designate
him the son of his father since that sound old
gentleman was the wealthiest farmer in that section
with but one son and heir to supplant him in
time in the role of county god and haply
perpetuate the prouder title of the biggest taxpayer on
the assessment list And this fact too fortunate
as it would seem was doubtless the indirect occasion
of a liberal percentage of all Johns misfortunes
From his earliest schooldays in the little
town up to his tardy graduation from a distant
college the influence of his fathers wealth invited
his procrastination humored its results encouraged
the laxity of his ambition and even now as John
used in bitter irony to put it it is aiding and
abetting me in the ostensible practise of my chosen
profession a listless aimless undetermined man of
forty and a confirmed bachelor at that At the
utterance of his selfdepreciating statement John generally
jerked his legs down from the top of his
desk and rising and kicking his chair back to the
wall he would stump around his littered office till
the manila carpet steamed with dust Then he
would wildly break away seeking refuge either in
the open street or in his room at the oldtime
tavern The Eagle House where he would say I
have lodged and boarded I do solemnly asseverate
for a long unbroken middleaged eternity of ten
years and can yet assert in the words of the more
fortunatelydying Webster that I still live

Extravagantly satirical as he was at times John
had always an indefinable drollery about him that
made him agreeable company to his friends at
least and such an admiring friend he had constantly
at hand in the person of Bert Haines Both
were Bohemians in natural tendency and though
John was far in Berts advance in point of age he
found the young man just the kind of a fellow to
have around while Bert in turn held his senior
in profound esteemlooked up to him in fact and
even in his eccentricities strove to pattern himself
after him And so it was when summer days were
dull and tedious these two could muse and doze the
hours away together and when the nights were long
and dark and deep and beautiful they could drift
out in the noonlight of the stars and with the soft
complaining flute and warbling lute lay the
pipes as John would say for their enduring
popularity with the girls And it was immediately
subsequent to one of these romantic excursions when
the belated pair at two oclock in the morning had
skulked up a side stairway of the old hotel and
gained Johns room with nothing more serious happening
than Bert falling over a trunk and smashing
his guitarjust after such a night of romance and
adventure it was that in the seclusion of Johns
room Bert had something of especial import to
communicate

Mack he said as that worthy anathematized
a spiteful match and then sucked his finger

Blast the allfired old torch said John wrestling
with the lampflue and turning on a welcome flame
at last Well you said Mack Why dont you
go on And dont bawl at the top of your lungs
either Youve already succeeded in waking every
boarder in the house with that guitar and you want
to make amends now by letting them go to sleep
again

But my dear fellow said Bert with forced
calmness youre the fellow thats making all the
noiseand

Why you howling dervish interrupted John
with a feigned air of pleased surprise and
admiration But lets drop controversy Throw the
fragments of your guitar in the woodbox there and
proceed with the opening proposition

What I was going to say was this said Bert
with a halfdesperate enunciation Im getting
tired of this way of livingclean deadtired and
fagged out and sick of the whole artificial business

Oh yes exclaimed John with a towering
disdain you neednt go any further I know just
what malady is throttling you Its reformreform
Youre going to turn over a new leaf and
all that and sign the pledge and quit cigars and
go to work and pay your debts and gravitate back
into Sundayschool where you can make love to
the preachers daughter under the guise of religion
and desecrate the sanctity of the innermost pale of
the church by confessions at Class of your thorough
conversion Oh youre going to

No but Im going to do nothing of the sort
interrupted Bert resentfully What I meanif
youll let me finishis Im getting too old to be
eternally undignifying myself with this singing of
midnight strains under Bonnybells windowpanes
and too old to be keeping myself in constant
humiliation and expense by the borrowing and stringing
up of old guitars together with the breakage of the
same and the general wearandtear on a constitution
that is slowly being sapped to its foundations
by exposure in the nightair and the dew

And while you receive no further compensation
in return said John than perhaps the coy turning
up of a lamp at an upper casement where the
jasmine climbs or an exasperating patter of
invisible palms or a huge dank wedge of fruitcake
shoved at you by the old man through a crack in
the door

Yes and Im going to have my just reward is
what I mean said Bert and exchange the lovers
life for the benedicts Going to hunt out a good
sensible girl and marry her And as the young
man concluded this desperate avowal he jerked the
bow of his cravat into a hard knot kicked his hat
under the bed and threw himself on the sofa like
an old suit

John stared at him with absolute compassion
Poor devil he said half musingly I know just
how he feels

 Ring in the wind his wedding chimes
 Smile villagers at every door
 Old churchyards stuffed with buried crimes
 Be clad in sunshine oer and oer


Oh here exclaimed the wretched Bert jumping
to his feet let up on that dismal recitative It
would make a dog howl to hear that

Then you let up on that suicidal talk of
marrying replied John and all that harangue of
incoherency about your growing old Why my dear
fellow youre at least a dozen years my junior
and look at me and John glanced at himself in the
glass with a feeble pride noting the gray sparseness
of his sidehair and its plaintive dearth on
top Of course Ive got to admit he continued
that my hair is gradually evaporating but for all
that Im still in the ring dont you know as
young in society for the matter of that as yourself
And this is just the reason why I dont want
you to blight every prospect in your life by marrying
at your ageespecially a womanI mean the
kind of woman youd be sure to fancy at your age

Didnt I say a good sensible girl was the kind
I had selected Bert remonstrated

Oh exclaimed John youve selected her
thenand without one word to me he ended
rebukingly

Well hang it all said Bert impatiently I
knew how YOU were and just how youd talk me
out of it and I made up my mind that for once at
least Id follow the dictations of a heart that
however capricious in youthful frivolitiesshould
beat in manhood loyal to itself and loyal to its
own affinity

Go it Fire away Farewell vain world
exclaimed the excited JohnTrade your soul off for
a pair of earbobs and a buttonhooka hank of
jute hair and a box of lilywhite Ive buried not
less than ten old chums this way and heres another
nominated for the tomb

But youve got no REASON about you began
BertI want to

And so do _I_ want to  broke in John finally
I want to get some sleepSo register and
come to bedAnd lie up on edge too when you
DO comecause this old catafalqueofabed is just
about as narrow as your views of single blessedness
Peace Not another word Pile in Pile
in Im threeparts sick anyhow and I want
rest And very truly he spoke

It was a bright morning when the slothful John
was aroused by a long vociferous pounding on the
door He started up in bed to find himself alone
the victim of his wrathful irony having evidently
risen and fled away while his pitiless tormentor
sleptDoubtless to accomplish at once that
nefarious intent as set forth by his unblushing
confession of last night mused the miserable John
And he ground his fingers in the corners of his
swollen eyes and leered grimly in the glass at the
feverish orbs bloodshot blurred and aching

The pounding on the door continued John
looked at his watch it was only eight oclock

Hi there he called viciously What do you
mean anyhow he went on elevating his voice
again shaking a man out of bed when hes just
dropping into his first sleep

I mean that youre going to get up thats what
replied a firm female voice Its eight oclock and I
want to put your room in order and Im not going
to wait all day about it either Get up and go
down to your breakfast and let me have the room
And the clamor at the door was industriously renewed

Say called John querulously hurrying on his
clothes Say you

Theres no say about it responded the
determined voice Ive heard about you and your
ways around this house and Im not going to put
up with it Youll not lie in bed till high noon
when Ive got to keep your room in proper order

Oh ho bawled John intelligently reckon
youre the new invasion here Doubtless youre
that girl thats been hanging up the new window
blinds that wont roll and disguising the pillows
with clean slips and hennin round among my
books and papers on the table here and aging me
generally till I dont know my own handwriting by
the time I find it Oh yes youre going to
revolutionize things here youre going to introduce
promptness and system and order See youve
even filled the washpitcher and tucked two starched
towels through the handle Havent got any tin
towels have you I rather like this new soap too
So solid and durable you know warranted not to
raise a lather Might as well wash ones hands with
a doorknob

And as Johns voice grumbled away into the
sullen silence again the determined voice without
responded Oh you can growl away to your
hearts content Mr McKinney but I want you
to understand distinctly that Im not going to humor
you in any of your old bachelor sluggardly
slovenly ways and whims and notions And I
want you to understand too that Im not hired
help in this house nor a chambermaid nor anything
of the kind Im the landlady here and Ill give you
just ten minutes more to get down to your breakfast
or youll not get anythats all And as
the reversed cuff John was in the act of buttoning
slid from his wrist and rolled under the dresser he
heard a stiff rustling of starched muslin flouncing
past the door and the quick italicized patter of
determined gaiters down the hall

Look here said John to the brightfaced boy
in the hotel office a half hour later It seems the
house heres been changing hands again

Yes sir said the boy closing the cigar case
and handing him a lighted match Well the new
landlord whoever he is continued John patronizingly
is a good one Leastwise he knows whats
good to eat and how to serve it

The boy laughed timidlyIt aint a landlord
thoughits a landlady its my mother

Ah said John dallying with the change the
boy had pushed toward him Your mother eh
And wheres your father

Hes dead said the boy

And whats this for abruptly asked John
examining his change

Thats your change said the boy You got
three for a quarter and gave me a half

Well YOU just keep it said John sliding back
the change Its for good luck you know my boy
Same as drinking your long life and prosperity
And oh yes by the way you may tell your mother
Ill have a friend to dinner with me today

Yes sir and thank you sir said the beaming
boy

Handsome boy mused John as he walked
down street Takes that from his father though
Ill wager my existence

Upon his office desk John found a hastily written
note It was addressed in the wellknown hand of
his old chum He eyed the missive apprehensively
and there was a positive pathos in his voice as he
said aloud Its our divorce I feel it The note
headed At the Office Four in Morning ran like
this


Dear MackI left you slumbering so soundly
that by noon when you waken I hope in your
refreshed state you will look more tolerantly on my
intentions as partially confided to you this night I
will not see you here again to say goodby I
wanted to but was afraid to rouse the sleeping
lion I will not close my eyes tonightfact is I
havent time Our serenade at Josies was a
prearranged signal by which she is to be ready and at
the station for the five morning train You may
remember the lighting of three consecutive matches
at her window before the igniting of her lamp
That meant Thrice dearest one Ill meet thee at
the depot at fourthirty sharp So my dear Mack
this is to inform you that even as you read Josie
and I have eloped It is all the old mans fault yet
I forgive him Hope hell return the favor Josie
predicts he will inside of a weekor two weeks
anyhow Goodby Mack old boy and let a fellow
down as easy as you can Affectionately
 BERT


Heavens exclaimed John stifling the note in
his hand and stalking tragically around the room
Can it be possible that I have nursed a frozen
viper An ingrate A wolf in sheeps clothing
An orangoutang in gents furnishings

Was you calling me sir asked a voice at the
door It was the janitor

No thundered John Quit my sight get out
of my way No no Thompson I dont mean
that he called after him Heres a halfdollar
for you and I want you to lock up the office and
tell anybody that wants to see me that Ive been
set upon and sacked and assassinated in cold blood
and Ive fled to my fathers in the country and am
lying there in the convulsions of dissolution babbling
of green fields and running brooks and thirsting
for the life of every woman that comes in gunshot
And then more like a confirmed invalid
than a man in the strength and pride of his prime
he crept down into the street again and thence back
to his hotel

Dejectedly and painfully climbing to his room he
encountered on the landing above a little woman
in a jaunty dustingcap and a trim habit of crisp
muslin He tried to evade her but in vain She
looked him squarely in the faceoccasioning him
the dubious impression of either needing shaving
very badly or having eggstains on his chin

Youre the gentleman in Number II I believe
Why Mr McKinney are you ill

He nodded confusedly

Mr McKinney is your name I think she
queried with a pretty elevation of the eyebrows

Yes maam said John rather abjectly You
see maamBut I beg pardon he went on
stammeringly and with a very awkward bowI beg
pardon but I am addressingahtheahthe

You are addressing the new landlady she
interpolated pleasantly Mrs Miller is my name I
think we should be friends Mr McKinney since I
hear that you are one of the oldest patrons of the
house

Thank youthank you said John completely
embarrassed Yes indeedha ha Oh yes
yesreally we must be quite old friends I assure
you MrsMrs

Mrs Miller smilingly prompted the little
woman

Yes ah yesMrs Miller Lovely morning
Mrs Miller said John edging past her and backing
toward his room

But as Mrs Miller was laughing outright for
some mysterious reason and gave no affirmation
in response to his proposition as to the quality of
the weather John utterly abashed and nonplused
darted into his room and closed the door Deucedly
extraordinary woman he thought wonder
whats her idea

He remained locked in his room till the dinner
hour and when he promptly emerged for that occasion
there was a very noticeable improvement in
his personal appearance in point of dress at least
though there still lingered about his smoothly
shaven features a certain haggard careworn
anxious look that would not out

Next his own at the table he found a chair tilted
forward as though in reservation for some honored
guest What did it mean Oh he remembered
now Told the boy to tell his mother he would have
a friend to dine with him Bertand blast the fellow
was doubtless dining then with a far preferable
companionhis wifein a palacecar on the
P C  St L a hundred miles away The thought
was maddening Of course now the landlady
would have material for a new assault And how
could he avert it A despairing film blurred his
sight for the momentthen the eyes flashed daringly
I will meet it like a man he said mentally
yea like a States AttorneyI will invite
it Let her do her worst

He called a servant giving some message in an
undertone

Yes sir said the agreeable servant Ill go
right away sir and left the room

Five minutes elapsed and then a voice at his
shoulder startled him

Did you send for me Mr McKinney What
is it I can do

You are very kind MrsMrs

Mrs Miller said the lady with a smile that he
remembered

Now please spare me even the mildest of
rebukes I deserve your censure but I cant stand it
I cant positively and there was a pleading
look in Johns lifted eyes that changed the little
womans smile to an expression of real solicitude
I have sent for you continued John to ask of
you three great favors Please be seated while I
enumerate them FirstI want you to forgive and
forget that illnatured uncalledfor grumbling of
mine this morning when you awakened me

Why certainly said the landlady again smiling
though quite seriously

I thank you said John with dignity And
second he continuedI want your assurance that
my extreme confusion and awkwardness on the occasion
of our meeting later were rightly interpreted

Certainlycertainly said the landlady with the
kindliest sympathy

I am gratefulutterly said John with newer
dignity And then he went onafter informing
you that it is impossible for the best friend I
have in the world to be with me at this hour as
intended I want you to do me the very great honor
of dining with me Will you

Why certainly said the charming little
landladyand a thousand thanks besides But tell me
something of your friend she continued as they
were being served What is he likeand what is
his nameand where is he

Well said John warilyhes like all young
fellows of his age Hes quite young you know
not over thirty I should saya mere boy in fact
but clevertalentedversatile

Unmarried of course said the chatty little
woman

Oh yes said John in a matterofcourse tone
but he caught himself abruptlythen stared intently
at his napkinglanced evasively at the side
face of his questioner and saidOh yes Yes
indeed Hes unmarriedOld bachelor like myself
you know Ha Ha

So hes not like the young man here that
distinguished himself last night said the little woman
archly

The fork in Johns hand halflifted to his lips
faltered and fell back toward his plate

Why whats that said John in a strange
voice I hadnt heard anything about itI mean
I havent heard anything about any young man
What was it

Havent heard anything about the elopement
exclaimed the little woman in astonishment
Why its been the talk of the town all morning
Elopement in high lifeson of a graindealer name
of Hines or Himes or something and a preachers
daughterJosie somebodydidnt catch her last
name Wonder if you dont know the parties
Why Mr McKinney are you ill

Oh nonot at all said John Dont mention
it Haha Just eating too rapidly thats all
Go on withyou were saying that Bert and Josie
had really eloped

What Bert asked the little woman quickly

Why did I say Bert said John with a guilty
look I meant Haines of course you know
Haines and JosieAnd did they really elope

Thats the report answered the little woman
as though deliberating some important evidence
and they say too that the plot of the runaway
was quite ingenious It seems the young lovers
were assisted in their flight by some old fellow
friend of the young mansWhy Mr McKinney
you ARE ill surely

Johns face was as ashen

Nono he gasped painfully Go ongo
on Tell me more about thethethe old fellow
the old reprobate And is he still at large

Yes said the little woman anxiously regarding
the strange demeanor of her companion They
say though that the law can do nothing with him
and that this fact only intensifies the agony of the
brokenhearted parentsfor it seems they have till
now regarded him both as a gentleman and family
friend in whom

I really am ill moaned John waveringly rising
to his feet but I beg you not to be alarmed Tell
your little boy to come to my room where I will
retire at once if youll excuse me and send for
my physician It is simply a nervous attack I am
often troubled so and only perfect quiet and
seclusion restores me You have done me a great
honor MrsMrs Miller sighed the
sympathetic little womanMrs Millerand I thank
you more than I have words to express He bowed
limply turned through a side door opening on a
stair and tottered to his room

During the three weeks illness through which he
passed John had every attentionmuch more indeed
than he had consciousness to appreciate For
the most part his mind wandered and he talked of
curious things and laughed hysterically and serenaded
mermaids that dwelt in grassy seas of dew
and were baldheaded like himself He played
upon a fourteenjointed flute of solid gold with
diamond holes and keys carved out of thawless ice
His old father came at first to take him home but
he could not be moved the doctor said

Two weeks of Johns illness had worn away
when a very seriouslooking young man in a traveling
duster and a high hat came up the stairs to
see him A handsome young lady was clinging to
his arm It was Bert and Josie She had guessed
the very date of their forgiveness John awoke
even clearer in mind than usual that afternoon He
recognized his old chum at a glance and Josie
now Berts wife Yes he comprehended that He
was holding a hand of each when another figure
entered His thin white fingers loosened their clasp
and he held a hand toward the newcomer Here
he said is my best friend in the worldBert you
and Josie will love her I know for this is Mrs
MrsMrs Miller said the radiant little woman
YesMrs Miller said John very proudly



AT ZEKESBURY

The little town as I recall it was of just enough
dignity and dearth of the same to be an ordinary
county seat in IndianaThe Grand Old
Hoosier State as it was used to being howlingly
referred to by the forensic stump orator from the
old stand in the courthouse yarda political
campaign being the wildest delight that Zekesbury
might ever hope to call its own

Through years the fitful happenings of the town
and its vicinity went on the samethe same Annually
about one circus ventured in and vanished
and was gone even as a passing trumpetblast the
usual rainy season swelled the Crick the driftage
choking at the covered bridge and backing water
till the old road looked amphibious and crowds
of curious townfolk struggled down to look upon
the watery wonder and lean awestruck above it
and spit in it and turn mutely home again

The usual formula of incidents peculiar to an
uneventful town and its vicinity The countryman
from Jessups Crossing with the cornstalk coffin
measure loped into town his steaming little gray
andredflecked roadster gurgitating as it were with that
mysterious utterance that ever has
commanded and ever must evoke the wonder and
bewilderment of every boy the smallpox rumor
became prevalent betimes and the subtle aroma of
the asafetidabag permeated the graded schools
from turret to foundationstone the still
recurring expose of the poorhouse management the
farmhand with the scythe across his shoulder
struck dead by lightning the longdrawn quarrel
between the rival editors culminating in one of them
assaulting the other with a sidestick and the other
kicking the one downstairs and thenceward ad
libitum the tramp suppositiously stealing a ride
found dead on the railroad the grand jury returning
a sensational indictment against a bartender
non est the Temperance outbreak the Revival
the Church Festival and the Free Lectures on
Phrenology and Marvels of Mesmerism at the
town hall It was during the time of the lastmentioned
sensation and directly through this scientific
investigation that I came upon two of the
towns most remarkable characters And however
meager my outline of them may prove my material
for the sketch is most accurate in every detail and
no deviation from the cold facts of the case shall
influence any line of my report

For some years prior to this odd experience
I had been connected with a daily paper at the
state capital and latterly a prolonged session of
the legislature where I specially reported having
told threateningly upon my health I took both the
advantage of a brief vacation and the invitation of a
young bachelor senator to get out of the city for
a while and bask my respiratory organs in the
revivifying rural air of Zekesburythe home of my
new friend

Itll pay you to get out here he said cordially
meeting me at the little station and Im glad youve
come for youll find no end of odd characters to
amuse you And under the very pleasant sponsorship
of my senatorial friend I was placed at
once on genial terms with half the citizens of the
little townfrom the shirtsleeved nabob of the
county office to the droll wag of the favorite loafing
placethe rules and bylaws of which resort by
the way being rudely charcoaled on the wall above
the cutters bench and somewhat artistically
culminating in an original dialect legend which ran
thus

 Fr instunce now when SOME folks gits
 To relyin on theyr wits
 Ten to one they git too smart
 And SPILE it all right at the start
 Feller wants to jest go slow
 And do his THINKIN first you know
 F I CASTT THINK UP SOMEPIN GOOD
 I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD


And it was at this inviting rendezvous two or
three evenings following my arrival that the general
crowd acting upon the random proposition of
one of the boys rose as a man and wended its
hilarious way to the town hall

Phrenology said the little old baldheaded
lecturer and mesmerist thumbing the eggshaped head
of a young man I remembered to have met that afternoon
in some law office phrenology repeated
the Professoror rather the TERM phrenologyis
derived from two Greek words signifying MIND
and DISCOURSE hence we find embodied in phrenology
proper the science of intellectual measurement
together with the capacity of intelligent communication
of the varying mental forces and their flexibilities
etc etc The study then of phrenology is
to simplify it whollyis I say the general
contemplation of the workings of the mind as made
manifest through the certain corresponding depressions
and protuberances of the human skull when of
course in a healthy state of action and development
as we find the conditions exemplified in the subject
before us

Here the subject vaguely smiled

You recognize that mug dont you whispered
my friend Its that coruscating young ass you
know Hedrickin Cummings officetrying to
study law and literature at the same time and
tampering with The Monster that Annually dont
you knowwhere we found the two young students
scuffling round the office and smelling of
peppermintHedrick you know and Sweeney
Sweeney the slim chap with the pallid face and
frogeyes and clammy hands You remember I
told you there was a pair of em Well theyre
up to something here tonight Hedrick there on
the stage in front and Sweeneydont you see
with the gang on the rear seats

Phrenologyagain continued the lecturer is
we may say a species of mental geography as it
were whichby a study of the skullleads also
to a study of the brain within even as geology
naturally follows the initial contemplation of the
earths surface The brain thurfur or intellectual
retort as we may say natively exerts a molding
influence on the skull contour thurfur is the expert
in phrenology most readily enabled to accurately
locate the multitudinous intellectual forces and
most exactingly estimate as well the sequent
character of each subject submitted to his scrutiny As
in the example before usa young man doubtless
well known in your midst though I may say an
entire stranger to myselfI venture to disclose
some characteristic trends and tendencies as
indicated by this phrenological depression and
development of the skull proper as later we will show
through the mesmeric condition the accuracy of our
mental diagnosis

Throughout the latter part of this speech my
friend nudged me spasmodically whispering something
which was jostled out of intelligent utterance
by some inward spasm of laughter

In this head said the Professor straddling
his malleable fingers across the young mans bumpy
browIn this head we find Ideality largeabnormally
large in fact thurby indicatingtaken in
conjunction with a like development of the perceptive
qualitieslanguage following as well in the
prominent eyethurby indicating I say our
subject as especially endowed with a love for the
beautifulthe sublimethe elevatingthe refined and
delicatethe lofty and superbin nature and in all
the sublimated attributes of the human heart and
beatific soul In fact we find this young man
possessed of such natural gifts as would befit him for
the exalted career of the sculptor the actor the
artist or the poetany ideal calling in fact any
calling but a practical matteroffact vocation
though in poetry he would seem to best succeed

Well said my friend seriously hes FEELING
for the boy Then laughingly Hedrick HAS written
some rhymes for the county papers and Sweeney
once introduced him at an Old Settlers Meeting
as The Best Poet in Center Township and never
cracked a smile Always after each other that way
but the best friends in the world SWEENEYS strong
suit is elocution He has a native ability that way
by no means ordinary but even that gift he abuses
and distorts simply to produce grotesque and oftentimes
ridiculous effects For instance nothing
more delights him than to loathfully consent to
answer a request at The Mite Society some evening
for an appropriate selection and then with
an elaborate introduction of the same and an
exalted tribute to the refined genius of the author
proceed with a most gruesome rendition of Alonzo
The Brave and The Fair Imogene in a way to
coagulate the blood and curl the hair of his fair
listeners with abject terror Pale as a corpse you
know and with that cadaverous face lit with those
malignantlooking eyes his slender figure and his
long thin legs and arms and hands and his whole
diabolical talent and adroitness brought into play
why I want to say to you its enough to scare em
to death Never a smile from him though till he
and Hedrick are safe out into the night again
then of course they hug each other and howl
over it like Modocs But pardon Im interrupting
the lecture Listen

A lack of continuity however continued the
Professor and an undue love of approbation
would measurably at least tend to retard the
young mans progress toward the consummation of
any loftier ambition I fear yet as we have intimated
if the subject were appropriately educated
to the needs demand he could doubtless produce
a high order of both prose and poetryespecially
the latterthough he could very illy bear being
laughed at for his pains

Hes dead wrong there said my friend
Hedrick enjoys being laughed at hes used to itgets
fat on it

Is fond of his friends continued the Professor
and the heartier they are the better might even
be convivially inclinedif so temptedbut prudent
in a degree loiteringly concluded the speaker
as though unable to find the exact bump with which
to bolster up the last named attribute

The subject blushed vividlymy friends right
eyelid dropped and there was a noticeable though
elusive sensation throughout the audience

BUT said the Professor explosively selecting
a directly opposite subject in conjunction with the
study of the one before us turning to the group at
the rear of the stage and beckoning we may find
a newer interest in the practical comparison of these
subjects side by side And the Professor pushed
a very pale young man into position

Sweeney whispered my friend delightedly
now look out

In THIS subject said the Professor we find
the practical business head Squarethough small
a trifle light at the base in fact but well balanced
at the important points at least thoughtful
eyewideawakecraftyquickrestlessa policy
eye though not denoting languageunless perhaps
mere business forms and direct statements

Fooled again whispered my friend and Im
afraid the old man will fail to nest out the fact
also that Sweeney is the coldbloodedest guyer on
the face of the earth and with more diabolical
resources than a prosecuting attorney the Professor
ought to know this too by this timefor these
same two chaps have been visiting the old man in
his room at the hotelthats what I was trying to
tell you a while ago The old chap thinks hes
playing the boys is my idea but its the other way
or I lose my guess

Now under the mesmeric influenceif the two
subjects will consent to its administration said
the Professor after some further tedious preamble
we may at once determine the fact of my assertions
as will be proved by their action while in
this peculiar state Here some apparent
remonstrance was met with from both subjects though
amicably overcome by the Professor first manipulating
the stolid brow and pallid front of the imperturbable
Sweeneyafter which the same mysterious
ordeal was loathfully submitted to by Hedrick
though a noticeably longer time was consumed in
securing his final loss of selfcontrol At last however
this curious phenomenon was presented and there
before us stood the two swaying figures the heads
dropped back the lifted hands with thumb and
fingertips pressed lightly together the eyelids
languid and half closed and the features in
appearance wan and humid

Now sir said the Professor leading the limp
Sweeney forward and addressing him in a quick
sharp tone of voiceNow sir you are a great
contractorown large factories and with untold
business interests Just look out there pointing
out across the expectant audience look there and
see the countless minions toiling servilely at your
dread mandates And yetha ha See see
They recognize the avaricious greed that would thus
grind them in the very dust they see alas they see
themselves halfclothedhalffed that you may
glut your coffers Halfstarved they listen to the
wail of wife and babe and with eyes upraised in
prayer they see YOU rolling by in gilded coach and
swathed in silk attire Butha again Look
look they are rising in revolt against you Speak
to them before too late Appeal to themquell
them with the promise of the just advance of wages
they demand

The limp figure of Sweeney took on something
of a stately and majestic air With a graceful and
commanding gesture of the hand he advanced a
step or two then after a pause of some seconds
duration in which the lifted face grew pale as it
seemed and the eyes a denser black he said

 But yesterday
 I looked away
 Oer happy lands where sunshine lay
 In golden blots
 Inlaid with spots
 Of shade and wild forgetmenots


The voice was low but clear and even musical
The Professor started at the strange utterance
looked extremely confused and as the boisterous
crowd cried Hear hear he motioned the subject
to continue with some gasping comment interjected
which if audible would have run thus
My God Its an inspirational poem

 My head was fair
 With flaxen hair

resumed the subject


Yoopee yelled an irreverent auditor

Silence silence commanded the excited Professor
in a hoarse whisper then turning enthusiastically
to the subjectGo on young man Go
onThy head was fair with flaxen hair 

 My head was fair
 With flaxen hair
 And fragrant breezes faint and rare
 And warm with drouth
 From out the south
 Blew all my curls across my mouth


The speakers voice exquisitely modulated yet
resonant as the twang of a harp now seemed of itself
to draw and hold each listener while a certain
extravagance of gesticulationa fantastic movement
of both form and featureseemed very near
akin to fascination And so flowed on the curious
utterance

 And cool and sweet
 My naked feet
 Found dewy pathways through the wheat
 And out again
 Where down the lane
 The dust was dimpled with the rain


In the pause following there was a breathlessness
almost painful The poem went on

 But yesterday
 I heard the lay
 Of summer birds when I as they
 With breast and wing
 All quivering
 With life and love could only sing

 My head was leant
 Where with it blent
 A maidens oer her instrument
 While all the night
 From vale to height
 Was filled with echoes of delight

 And all our dreams
 Were lit with gleams
 Of that lost land of reedy streams
 Along whose brim
 Forever swim
 Pans lilies laughing up at him

And still the inspired singer held rapt sway


It is wonderful I whispered under breath

Of course it is answered my friend But
listen there is more

 But yesterday    
 O blooms of May
 And summer roseswhere away
 O stars above
 And lips of love
 And all the honeyed sweets thereof

 O lad and lass
 And orchard pass
 And briered lane and daisied grass
 O gleam and gloom
 And woodland bloom
 And breezy breaths of all perfume

 No more for me
 Or mine shall be
 Thy rapturessave in memory
 No moreno more
 Till through the Door
 Of Glory gleam the days of yore

This was the evident conclusion of the remarkable
utterance and the Professor was impetuously
fluttering his hands about the subjects upward
staring eyes stroking his temples and snapping his
fingers in his face

Well said Sweeney as he stood suddenly
awakened and grinning in an idiotic way how did
the old thing work And it was in the consequent
hilarity and loud and long applause perhaps
that the Professor was relieved from the explanation
of this rather astounding phenomenon of the
idealistic workings of a purely practical brainor as
my impious friend scoffed the incongruity later
in a particularly withering allusion as the blank
blanked fallacy dont you know of staying the
hunger of a howling mob by feeding em on spring
poetry

The tumult of the audience did not cease even
with the retirement of Sweeney and cries of Hedrick
Hedrick only subsided with the Professors
highkeyed announcement that the subject was even
then endeavoring to make himself heard but
could not until utter quiet was restored adding
the further appeal that the young man had already
been a long time under the mesmeric spell and
ought not be so detained for an unnecessary period
See he concluded with an assuring wave of the
hand toward the subject see he is about to address
you Now quietutter quiet if you please

Great heavens exclaimed my friend stiflingly
just look at the boy Get on to that position for a
poet Even Sweeney has fled from the sight of
him

And truly too it was a grotesque pose the young
man had assumed not wholly ridiculous either
since the dwarfed position he had settled into
seemed more a genuine physical condition than an
affected one The head backtilted and sunk between
the shoulders looked abnormally large while
the features of the face appeared peculiarly child
likeespecially the eyeswakeful and wide apart
and very bright yet very mild and very artless and
the drawn and cramped outline of the legs and feet
and of the arms and hands even to the shrunken
slenderlooking fingers all combined to convey most
strikingly to the pained senses the fragile frame
and pixy figure of some pitiably afflicted child
unconscious altogether of the pathos of its own deformity

Now mark the cuss Horatio gasped my
friend

At first the speakers voice came very low and
somewhat piping too and brokenan eery sort of
voice it was of brittle and erratic timbre and undulant
inflection Yet it was beautiful It had the
ring of childhood in it though the ring was not pure
golden and at times fell echoless The SPIRIT of its
utterance was always clear and pure and crisp and
cheery as the twitter of a bird and yet forever ran
an undercadence through it like a lowpleading
prayer Half garrulously and like a shallow brook
might brawl across a shelvy bottom the rhythmic
little changeling thus began

 Im thist a little crippled boy an never goin to grow
 An git a great big man at allcause Aunty told me so
 When I was thist a baby onct I falled out of the bed
 An got The Curvture of the Spineats what the Doctor
said
 I never had no Mother nenfer my Pa runned away
 An dassnt come back here no morecause he was drunk one day
 An stobbed a man in thishere town an couldnt pay his fine
 An nen my Ma she diedan I got Curvture of the Spine


A few titterings from the younger people in the
audience marked the opening stanza while a certain
restlessness and a changing to more attentive positions
seemed the general tendency The old Professor
in the meantime had sunk into one of the
empty chairs The speaker went on with more gaiety

 Im nine years old An you cant guess how much I weigh I
bet
 Last birthday I weighed thirtythreeAn I weigh thirty yet
 Im awful little fer my sizeIm purt nigh littler an
 Some babies isan neighbers all calls me The Little Man
 An Doc one time he laughed an said I spect first think
you know
 Youll have a little spiketail coat an travel with a show
 An nen I laughedtill I looked round an Aunty was acryin
 Sometimes she acts like that cause I got Curvture of the
Spine


Just in front of me a great broadshouldered
countryman with a rainy smell in his cumbrous
overcoat cleared his throat vehemently looked
startled at the sound and again settled forward his
weedy chin resting on the knuckles of his hands as
they tightly clutched the seat before him And it
was like being taken into a childish confidence as the
quaint speech continued

 I setwhile Auntys washinon my little longleg stool
 An watch the little boys an girls askippin by to school
 An I peck on the winder an holler out an say
 Who wants to fight The Little Man at dares you all today
 An nen the boys climbs on the fence an little girls peeks
through
 An they all says Cause youre so big you think were feard
o you
 An nen they yell an shake their fist at me like I shake
mine
 Theyre thist in fun you know cause I got Curvture of the
Spine


Well whispered my friend with rather odd
irrelevance I thought of course you see through
the scheme of the fellows by this time dont you

I see nothing said I most earnestly but a
poor little wisp of a child that makes me love him
so I dare not think of his dying soon as he surely
must There listen And the plaintive gaiety
of the homely poem ran on

 At evening when the ironin s done an Auntys fixed the
fire
 An filled an lit the lamp an trimmed the wick an turned it
higher
 An fetched the wood all in fer night an locked the kitchen
door
 An stuffed the ole crack where the wind blows in up through the
floor
 She sets the kittle on the coals an biles an makes the tea
 An fries the liver an the mush an cooks a egg fer me
 An sometimeswhen I cough so hardher elderberry wine
 Dont go so bad fer little boys with Curvture of the Spine


Look whispered my friend touching me with
his elbow Look at the Professor

Look at everybody said I And the artless
little voice went on again half quaveringly

 But Auntys all so childishlike on my account you see
 Im most afeard shell be took downan ats what bothers
ME
 Cause ef my good ole Aunty ever would git sick an die
 I dont know what shed do in Heaventill _I_ come by an by
 Fer shes so ust to all my ways an everthing you know
 An no one there like me to nurse an worry over so
 Cause all the little childerns theres so straight an strong
an fine
 Theys nary angel bout the place with Curvture of the
Spine


The old Professors face was in his handkerchief
so was my friends in his and so was mine in mine
as even now my pen drops and I reach for it again
I half regret joining the mad party that had gathered
an hour later in the old law office where these
two graceless characters held almost nightly revel
the instigators and conniving hosts of a reputed
banquet whose MENUS range confined itself to herrings
or blind robins dried beef and cheese with
crackers gingerbread and sometimes pie the whole
washed down with anything but

 Wines that heaven knows when
 Had sucked the fire of some forgotten sun
 And kept it through a hundred years of gloom
 Still glowing in a heart of ruby


But the affair was memorable The old Professor
was himself lured into it and loudest in his praise
of Hedricks realistic art and I yet recall him at the
orgies height excitedly repulsing the continued
slurs and insinuations of the clammyhanded
Sweeney who still contending against the old mans
fulsome praise of his more fortunate rival at last
openly declared that Hedrick was NOT a poet NOT a
genius and in no way worthy to be classed in the
same breath with HIMSELFthe gifted but unfortunate
SWEENEY sirthe unacknowledged author
sir y gad sirof the two poems that held you
spellbound tonight



A CALLER FROM BOONE

BENJ F JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR

It was a dim and chill and loveless afternoon in
the late fall of eightythree when I first saw
the genial subject of this hasty sketch From time
to time the daily paper on which I worked had been
receiving among the general literary driftage of
amateur essayists poets and sketchwriters some
conceits in verse that struck the editorial head as
decidedly novel and as they were evidently the
production of an unlettered man and an OLD man
and a farmer at that they were usually spared the
wastebasket and preservednot for publication
but to pass from hand to hand among the members
of the staff as simply quaint and mirthprovoking
specimens of the verdancy of both the venerable
author and the Muse inspiring him Letters as
quaint as were the poems invariably accompanied
them and the oddity of these in fact had first called
attention to the verses I well remember the general
merriment of the office when the first of the old
mans letters was read aloud and I recall too some
of his comments on his own verse verbatim In
one place he said I make no doubt you will find some purty SAD
spots in my poetry considerin but
I hope you will bear in mind that I am a great
sufferer with rheumatizum and have been off and
on sence the cold New Years In the main however
he continued I allus aim to write in a cheerful
comfortin sperit sos ef the stuff hangs fire
and dont do no good it haint agoin to do no
harmand thems my honest views on poetry

In another letter evidently suspecting his poem
had not appeared in print because of its dejected
tone he said The poetry I herewith send was
wrote off on the finest Autumn day I ever laid eyes
on I never felt better in my life The morning air
was as invigoratin as bitters with tanzy in it and the
folks at breakfast said they never saw such a appetite
on mortal man before Then I lit out for the
barn and after feedin I come back and tuck my
pen and ink out on the porch and jest cut loose I
writ and writ till my fingers was that cramped I
couldnt hardly let go of the penholder And the
poem I send you is the upshot of it all Ef you dont
find it cheerful enough fer your columns Ill have
to knock under thats all And that poem as I recall
it certainly was cheerful enough for publication
only the copy was almost undecipherable and the
ink too so pale and vague it was thought best to
reserve the verses for the time at least and later on
revise copy punctuate and then print it sometime
as much for the joke of it as anything But it
was still delayed neglected and in a weeks time
almost entirely forgotten And so it was upon this
chill and somber afternoon I speak of that an event
occurred which most pleasantly reminded me of
both the poem with the sad spots in it and the
cheerful one writ out on the porch that glorious
autumn day that poured its glory through the
old mans letter to us

Outside and in the sanctum the gloom was too
oppressive to permit an elevated tendency of either
thought or spirit I could do nothing but sit listless
and inert Paper and pencil were before me but
I could not writeI could not even think coherently
and was on the point of rising and rushing out into
the streets for a wild walk when there came a
hesitating knock at the door

Come in I snarled grabbing up my pencil and
assuming a frightfully industrious air Come in
I almost savagely repeated Come in And shut the
door behind you and I dropped my lids bent my
gaze fixedly upon the blank pages before me and
began scrawling some disconnected nothings with
no head or tail or anything

Sir howdy said a low and pleasant voice And
at once in spite of my perverse resolve I looked up
I someway felt rebuked

The speaker was very slowly noiselessly closing
the door I could hardly face him when he turned
around An old man of sixtyfive at least but with
a face and an eye of the most cheery and wholesome
expression I had ever seen in either youth or age
Over his broad bronzed forehead and white hair
he wore a lowcrowned widebrimmed black felt
hat somewhat rusted now and with the band
greasecrusted and the binding frayed at intervals
and sagging from the threads that held it on An
oldstyled frock coat of black dull brown in streaks
and quite shiny about the collar and lapels A waistcoat
of no describable material or pattern and a
clean white shirt and collar of one piece with a black
stringtie and double bow which would have been
entirely concealed beneath the long white beard
but for its having worked around to one side
of the neck The front outline of the face was
cleanly shaven and the beard growing simply from
the under chin and throat lent the old pioneer the
rather singular appearance of having hair all over
him with this luxurious growth pulled out above
his collar for mere sample

I arose and asked the old man to sit down handing
him a chair decorously

Nono he saidIm much obleeged I haint
come in to bother you no moren I can hep All
I wanted was to know ef you got my poetry all right
You know I take yer paper he went on in an
explanatory way and seein you printed poetry in it
onceinawhile I sent you some of mineneighbors
kindo advised me to he added apologetically and
so I sent you sometwo or three times I sent you
some but I haint never seed hidenerhair of it in
your paper and as I wus in town today anyhow
I jest thought Id kindo drap in and git it back ef
you aint goin to print itcause I allus save up
most the things I write aimin sometime to git em
all struck off in pamphletform to kindo distribit
round mongst the neighbors dont you know

Already I had begun to suspect my visitors identity
and was mechanically opening the drawer of
our poetical department

How was your poetry signed I asked

Signed by my own name he answered proudly
signed by my own nameJohnsonBenjamin
F Johnson of Boone Countythis state

And is this one of them Mr Johnson I asked
unfolding a clumsilyfolded manuscript and closely
scrutinizing the verse

How does she read said the old man eagerly
and searching in the meantime for his spectacles
How does she readThen I can tell you

It reads said I studiously conning the old
mans bold but bad chirography and tilting my chair
back indolentlyit reads like thisthe first verse
doesand I very gravely read

 Oh the old swimminhole


Stop Stop said the old man excitedlyStop
right there Thats my poetry but thats not the
way to read it by a long shot Give it to me and
he almost snatched it from my hand Poetry like
this aint no poetry at all less you read it NATCHURL
and IN JEST THE SAME SPERIT AT ITS WRIT IN dont you
understand Its a old man atalkin rickollect and
afeelin kindo sad and yit kindo sorto good too
and I opine he wouldnt got that off with a face on
him like a undertaker and a voice as solemn as a cowbell after
dark Hed say it more like this
And the old man adjusted his spectacles and read


 THE OLD SWIMMINHOLE

 Oh the old swimminhole whare the crick so still and deep
 Looked like a babyriver that was laying half asleep
 And the gurgle of the worter round the drift jest below
 Sounded like the laugh of something we onct ust to know
 Before we could remember anything but the eyes
 Of the angels lookin out as we left Paradise
 But the merry days of youth is beyond our controle
 And its hard to part ferever with the old swimminhole


I clapped my hands in genuine applause Read
on I saidRead on Read all of it

The old mans face was radiant as he continued

 Oh the old swimminhole In the happy days of yore
 When I ust to lean above it on the old sickamore
 Oh it showed me a face in its warm sunny tide
 That gazed back at me so gay and glorified
 It made me love myself as I leaped to caress
 My shadder smilin up at me with sich tenderness
 But them days is past and gone and old Times tuck his toll
 From the old man come back to the old swimminhole

 Oh the old swimminhole In the long lazy days
 When the humdrum of school made so many runaways
 How pleasant was the jurney down the old dusty lane
 Whare the tracks of our bare feet was all printed so plane
 You could tell by the dent of the heel and the sole
 They was lots o fun on hands at the old swimminhole
 But the lost joys is past Let your tears in sorrow roll
 Like the rain that ust to dapple up the old swimminhole

 Thare the bullrushes growed and the cattails so tall
 And the sunshine and shadder fell over it all
 And it mottled the worter with amber and gold
 Till the glad lilies rocked in the ripples that rolled
 And the snakefeeders four gauzy wings fluttered by
 Like the ghost of a daisy dropped out of the sky
 Or a wownded appleblossom in the breezes controle
 As it cut acrost some orchurd tords the old swimminhole

 Oh the old swimminhole When I last saw the place
 The scenes was all changed like the change in my face
 The bridge of the railroad now crosses the spot
 Whare the old divinlog lays sunk and fergot
 And I stray down the banks whare the trees ust to be
 But never again will theyr shade shelter me
 And I wish in my sorrow I could strip to the soul
 And dive off in my grave like the old swimminhole


My applause was long and loud The old mans
interpretation of the poem was a positive revelation
though I was glad enough to conceal from him my
moistened eyes by looking through the scraps for
other specimens of his verse

Here said I enthusiastically is another one
signed Benj F Johnson read me this and I
handed him the poem

The old man smiled and took the manuscript
Thishere ones on The Hoss  he said simply
clearing his throat They aint so much fancy
work about this as the othern but theys jest as
much FACT you can betcause theyre no animal
alivin at I love better an

THE HOSS

 The hoss he is a splendud beast
 He is mans friend as heaven desined
 And search the world from west to east
 No honester youll ever find

 Some calls the hoss a pore dumb brute
 And yit like Him who died fer you
 I say as I theyr charge refute
 Fergive they know not what they do

 No wiser animal makes tracks
 Upon these earthly shores and hence
 Arose the axium true as facts
 Extoled by all as Good hosssense

 The hoss is strong and knows his strenth
 You hitch him up a time er two
 And lash him and hell go his lenth
 And kick the dashboard out fer you

 But treat him allus good and kind
 And never strike him with a stick
 Ner aggervate him and youll find
 Hell never do a hostile trick

 A hoss whose master tends him right
 And worters him with daily care
 Will do your biddin with delight
 And act as docile as YOU air

 Hell paw and prance to hear your praise
 Because hes learnt to love you well
 And though you cant tell what he says
 Hell nicker all he wants to tell

 He knows you when you slam the gate
 At early dawn upon your way
 Unto the barn and snorts elate
 To git his corn er oats er hay

 He knows you as the orphant knows
 The folks that loves her like theyr own
 And raises her and finds her clothes
 And schools her tel a womerngrown

 I claim no hoss will harm a man
 Ner kick ner run away cavort
 Stumpsuck er balk er catamaran
 Ef youll jest treat him as you ort

 But when I see the beast abused
 And clubbed around as Ive saw some
 I want to see his owner noosed
 And jest yanked up like Absolum

 Of course theys differunce in stock
 A hoss that has a little yeer
 And slender build and shaller hock
 Can beat his shadder mighty near

 Whilse one thats thick in neck and chist
 And big in leg and full in flank
 That tries to race I still insist
 Hell have to take the second rank

 And I have jest laid back and laughed
 And rolled and wallered in the grass
 At fairs to see some heavydraft
 Lead out at FIRST yit come in LAST

 Each hoss has his appinted place
 The heavy hoss should plow the soil
 The blooded racer he must race
 And win big wages fer his toil

 I never betner never wrought
 Upon my feller man to bet
 And yit at times Ive often thought
 Of my convictions with regret

 I bless the hoss from hoof to head
 From head to hoof and tale to mane
 I bless the hoss as I have said
 From head to hoof and back again

 I love my God the first of all
 Then Him that perished on the cross
 And next my wifeand then I fall
 Down on my knees and love the hoss


Again I applauded handing the old man still
another of his poems and the last received Ah
said he as his gentle eyes bent on the title this
heres the cheerfullest one of em all This is the
one writ as I wrote you abouton that glorious
October morning two weeks agoI thought your
paper would print thisun shore

Oh it WILL print it I said eagerly and it will
print the other two as well It will print ANYTHING
that you may do us the honor to offer and well
reward you beside just as you may see fit to designate
But go ongo on Read me the poem

The old mans eyes were glistening as he responded
with the poem entitled


WHEN THE FROST IS ON THE PUNKIN

 When the frost is on the punkin and the fodders in the shock
 And you hear the kyouck and gobble of the struttin turkeycock
And the clackin of the guineys and the cluckin of the hens
 And the roosters hallylooyer as he tiptoes on the fence
 O its thens the times a feller is afeelin at his best
 With the risin sun to greet him from a night of peaceful rest
 As he leaves the house bareheaded and goes out to feed the
stock
 When the frost is on the punkin and the fodders in the shock

 Theys something kindo hartylike about the atmusfere
 When the heat of summers over and the coolin fall is here
 Of course we miss the flowers and the blossums on the trees
 And the mumble of the humminbirds and buzzin of the bees
 But the airs so appetizin and the landscape through the haze
 Of a crisp and sunny morning of the airly autumn days
 Is a pictur that no painter has the colorin to mock
 When the frost is on the punkin and the fodders in the shock

 The husky rusty russel of the tossels of the corn
 And the raspin of the tangled leaves as golden as the morn
 The stubble in the furrieskindo lonesomelike but still
 Apreachin sermuns to us of the barns they growed to fill
 The strawstack in the medder and the reaper in the shed
 The hosses in theyr stalls belowthe clover overhead
 O it sets my hart aclickin like the tickin of a clock
 When the frost is on the punkin and the fodders in the shock

 Then your apples all is getherd and the ones a feller keeps
 Is poured around the cellerfloor in red and yeller heaps
 And your cidermakin s over and your wimmernfolks is through
 With theyr mince and applebutter and theyr souse and saussage
too   
 I dont know how to tell itbut ef sich a thing could be
 As the Angels wantin boardin and theyd call around on ME
 Id want to commodate emall the wholeindurin flock
 When the frost is on the punkin and the fodders in the shock


That was enough Surely thought I here is a
diamond in the rough and a gem too of purest
ray serene I caught the old mans hand and
wrung it with positive rapture and it is needless to
go further in explanation of how the readers of our
daily came to an acquaintance through its columns
with the crude unpolished yet most gentle genius of
Benj F Johnson of Boone



THE OLD SOLDIERS STORY

AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW
YORK CITY

Since we have had no stories tonight I will
venture Mr President to tell a story that I
have heretofore heard at nearly all the banquets I
have ever attended It is a story simply and you
must bear with it kindly It is a story as told by
a friend of us all who is found in all parts of all
countries who is immoderately fond of a funny
story and who unfortunately attempts to tell a
funny story himselfone that he has been particularly
delighted with Well he is not a storyteller
and especially he is not a funny storyteller His
funny stories indeed are oftentimes touchingly
pathetic But to such a story as he tells being a
goodnatured man and kindly disposed we have to
listen because we do not want to wound his feelings
by telling him that we have heard that story a
great number of times and that we have heard it
ably told by a great number of people from the time
we were children But as I say we can not hurt his
feelings We can not stop him We can not kill him
and so the story generally proceeds He selects a very old story
always and generally tells it in about
this fashion

I heerd an awful funny thing the other dayha
ha I dont know whether I kin git it off er not
but anyhow Ill tell it to you Wellles see now
how the foolthing goes Oh yesWy there was
a feller one timeit was during the army and this
feller that I started in to tell you about was in the
war andha hathere was a big fight agoin on
and this feller was in the fight and it was a big battle
and bullets aflyin ever which way and bomb
shells abustin and cannonballs aflyin round
promiskus and this feller right in the midst of it
you know and all excited and het up and chargin
away and the fust thing you know along come a
cannonball and shot his head offha ha ha
Hold on here a minuteno sir Im agittin ahead
of my story no no it didnt shoot his HEAD off
Im gittin the cart before the horse thereshot his
LEG off that was the way shot his leg off and
down the poor feller drapped and of course in that
condition was perfectly hepless you know but yit
with presence o mind enough to know that he was
in a dangerous condition ef somepin wasnt done fer
him right away So he seen a comrade achargin
by that he knowed and he hollers to him and called
him by nameI disremember now what the fellers
name was   

Well thats got nothin to do with the story
anyway he hollers to him he did and says Hello
there he says to him here I want you to come
here and give me a lift I got my leg shot off and
I want you to pack me back to the rear of the battle
where the doctors always is you know during a
fightand he says I want you to pack me back
there where I can get meddycinal attention er Im
a dead man fer I got my leg shot off he says
and I want you to pack me back there sos
the surgeons kin take keer of me Well
the feller as luck would have it rickonized him
and run to him and throwed down his own musket
sos he could pick him up and he stooped down and
picked him up and kindo halfway shouldered him
and halfway helt him betwixt his arms like and
then he turned and started back with himha ha
ha Now mind the fight was still agoin onand
right at the hot of the fight and the feller all
excited you know like he was and the soldier that
had his leg shot off gittin kindo fainty like and his
head kindo stuck back over the fellers shoulder
that was carryin him And he hadnt got moren a
couple o rods with him when another cannonball

and the curioust thing about it washa hathat
the feller was apackin him didnt know that he
had been hit agin at all and back he wentstill
carryin the deceased backha ha hato where
the doctors could take keer of himas he thought
Well his capn happened to see him and he thought
it was a ruther curous pceedinsa soldier carryin
a dead body out o the fightdont you see And
so he hollers at him and he says to the soldier the
capn did he says Hullo there where you goin
with that thing the capn said to the soldier who
was acarryin away the feller that had his leg shot
off Well his head too by that time So he says
Where you going with that thing the capn said
to the soldier who was acarryin away the feller that
had his leg shot off Well the soldier he stopped
kinder halted you know like a private soldier will
when his presidin officer speaks to himand he says
to him Wy he says Cap its a comrade o mine
and the pore feller has got his leg shot off and Im
apackin him back to where the doctors is and there
was nobody to hep him and the feller would a died
in his trackser track rutherif it hadnt abeen fer
me and Im apackin him back where the surgeons
can take keer of him where he can get medical
attendanceer his wifes a widder he says  cause
hes got his leg shot off Then CAPN says You
blame fool you hes got his HEAD shot off So then
the feller slacked his grip on the body and let it
slide down to the ground and looked at it a minute
all puzzled you know and says Wy he told me
it was his leg Ha ha ha




DIALECT IN LITERATURE

And the common people heard him gladly

Of what shall be said herein of dialect let it be
understood the term dialect referred to is of
that general breadth of meaning given it today
namely any speech or vernacular outside of the
prescribed form of good English in its present state
The present state of the English is of course not
any one of its prior states So first let it be
remarked that it is highly probable that what may
have been the best of English once may now by some
be counted as a weak inconsequent patois or
dialect

To be direct it is the object of this article to show
that dialect is not a thing to be despised in any event
that its origin is oftentimes of as royal caste as
that of any speech Listening back from the stand
point of today even to the divine singing of that old
classic master to whom Englands late laureate
refers as

    the first warbler whose sweet breath
 Preluded those melodious bursts that fill
 The spacious times of great Elizabeth
 With sounds that echo still

or to whom Longfellow alludes in his matchless
sonnet as

    the poet of the dawn who wrote
 The Canterbury Tales and his old age
 Made beautiful with song

Chaucers verse to us is NOW as veritably dialect as
to that old time it was the chastest English and even
then his materials were essentially dialect when his
song was at best pitch Again our present dialect
of most plebeian ancestry may none the less prove
worthy Mark the recognition of its own personal
merit in the great new dictionary where what was
in our own remembrance the most outlandish dialect
is now good sound official English

Since Literature must embrace all naturally
existing materialsphysical mental and spiritualwe
have no occasion to urge its acceptance of socalled
dialect for dialect IS in Literature and HAS been
there since the beginning of all written thought and
utterance Strictly speaking as well as paradoxically
all verbal expression is more or less dialectic
however grammatical While usage establishes
grammar it no less establishes socalled dialect
Therefore we may as rightfully refer to socalled
grammar

It is not really a question of Literatures position
toward dialect that we are called upon to consider
but rather how much of Literatures valuable time
shall be taken up by this dialectic country cousin
This question Literature her gracious self most
amiably answers by hugging to her breast voluminous
tomes from Chaucer on to Dickens from
Dickens on to Joel Chandler Harris And this
affectionate spirit on the part of Literature in the
main we all most feelingly indorse

Briefly summed it would appear that dialect
means something more than mere rude form of
speech and actionthat it must in some righteous
and substantial way convey to us a positive force
of soul truth dignity beauty grace purity and
sweetness that may even touch us to the tenderness
of tears Yes dialect as certainly does all this as
that speech and act refined may do it and for the
same reasons it is simply purely natural and
human

Yes the Lettered and the Unlettered powers are
at swords points and very old and bitter foemen
too they are As fairly as we can then let us look
over the field of these contending forces and note
their diverse positions First THE LETTEREDthey
who have the full advantages of refined education
training and associationare undoubtedly as
wholly out of order among the UNLETTERED as the
Unlettered are out of order in the exalted presence
of the Lettered Each faction may in like aversion
ignore or snub the other but a longsuffering Providence
must bear with the society of both There
may be one vague virtue demonstrated by this feud
each division will be found unwaveringly loyal to
its kind and mutually they desire no interchange of
sympathy whateverNeither element will accept
from the other any PATRONIZING treatment and
perhaps the more especially does the UNLETTERED faction
reject anything in vaguest likeness of this spirit Of
the two divisions in graphic summaryONE knows
the very core and center of refined civilization and
this only the OTHER knows the outlying wilds and
suburbs of civilization and this only Whose therefore
is the greater knowledge and whose the just
right of any whit of selfglorification

A curious thing indeed is this factional pride as
made equally manifest in both forces in one for
instance of the Unlettered forces The average
farmer or countryman knows in reality a far better
and wider range of diction than he permits himself
to use He restricts and abridges the vocabulary
of his speech fundamentally for the reason
that he fears offending his rural NEIGHBORS to whom
a choicer speech might suggest on his part an
assumptiona spirit of conscious superiority and
therewith an implied reflection on THEIR lack of
intelligence and general worthiness If there is any
one text universally known and nurtured of the
Unlettered masses of our common country it is that
which reads All men are created equal Therefore
it is a becoming thing when true gentility prefers
to overlook some variations of the class who
more from lack of cultivation than out of rude
intent sometimes almost compel a positive doubt of
the nice veracity of the declaration or at least a
grief at the munificent liberality of the sobequoted
statement The somewhat bewildering position of
these conflicting forces leaves us nothing further to
consider but how to make the most and best of the
situation so far as Literature may be hurt or helped
thereby

Equally with the perfect English then dialect
should have full justice done it Then always it is
worthy and in Literature is thus welcome The
writer of dialect should as reverently venture in its
use as in his chastest English His effort in the
SCHOLARLY and ELEGANT direction suffers no neglect
he is SCHOOLED in that perhaps he may explain
Then let him be SCHOOLED in DIALECT before he sets
up as an expounder of ita teacher forsooth a
master The real master must not only know each
varying light and shade of dialect expression but
he must as minutely know the inner character of the
people whose native tongue it is else his product is
simply a pretensea wilful forgery a rank
abomination Dialect has been and is thus insulted
vilified and degraded now and continually and
through this outrage solely thousands of generous
minded readers have been turned against dialect
who otherwise would have loved and blessed it in
its real form of crude purity and unstrained sweetness

 Honey dripping from the comb


Let no impious faddist then assume its just
interpretation He may know everything else in the
world but not dialect nor dialectic people for both
of which he has supreme contempt which same be
sure is heartily returned Such a superior
personage may even go among these simple country
people and abide indefinitely in the midst of them
yet their more righteous contempt never for one instant
permits them to be their real selves in his presence
In consequence his most conscientious report
of them their ways lives and interests is absolutely
of no importance or value in the world He
never knew them nor will he ever know them They
are not his kind of people any more than he is their
kind of man and THEIR disappointment grieves us
more than his

The master in Literature as in any art is that
divinely gifted man who does just obeisance to
all living creatures both man and beast and bird
It is this master only who as he writes can sweep
himself aside and leave his humble characters to do
the thinking and the talking This man it is who
celebrates his performancenot himself His work
he celebrates because it is not his only but because
he feels it to be the conscientious reproduction of
life itselfas he has seen and known and felt ita
representation it is of Gods own script translated
and transcribed by the worshipful mind and heart
and hand of genius This virtue is impartially
demanded in all art and genius only can fully
answer the demand in any art for which we claim
perfection The painter has his expression of it
with no slighting of the dialect element so too the
sculptor the musician and the list entire In the
line of Literature and literary material an illustration
of the nice meaning and distinction of the art
of dialect will be found in Charles Dudley Warners
comment on George Cables work as far back as
1883 referring to the authors own rendition of it
from the platform Mr Warner says

While the author was unfolding to his audience a life
and society unfamiliar to them and entrancing them with
pictures the reality of which none doubted and the spell
of which none cared to escape it occurred to me that here
was the solution of all the pother we have recently got into
about the realistic and the ideal schools in fiction In
Posson Jone an awkward campmeeting country preacher
is the victim of a vulgar confidence game the scenes are
the street a drinkingplace a gamblingsaloon a bullring
and a calaboose there is not a respectable character in
it Where shall we look for a more faithful picture of low
life Where shall we find another so vividly set forth in
all its sordid details And yet see how art steps in with
the wand of genius to make literature Over the whole the
author has cast an ideal light over a picture that in the
hands of a bungling realist would have been repellent he
has thrown the idealizing grace that makes it one of the
most charming sketches in the world Here is nature as
nature only ought to be in literature elevated but never
departed from


So we find dialect as a branch of literature
worthy of the high attention and employment of
the greatest master in lettersnot the merest
mountebank Turn to Dickens in innumerable
passages of pathos the death of poor Jo or that
of the Cheap Johns little daughter in her fathers
arms on the footboard of his peddling cart before
the jeering of the vulgar mob smile moistly too
at Mr Slearys odd philosophies or at the trials
of Sissy Jupe or lift and tower with indignation
giving ear to Stephen Blackpool and the stainless
nobility of his cloyed utterances

The crudeness or the homeliness of the dialectic
element does not argue its unfitness in any way
Some readers seem to think so but they are wrong
and very gravely wrong Our own brief history as
a nation and our finding and founding and maintaining
of it left our forefathers little time indeed
for the delicate cultivation of the arts and graces
of refined and scholarly attainments And there
is little wonder and utter blamelessness on their
part if they lapsed in point of high mental
accomplishments seeing their attention was so absorbed
by propositions looking toward the protection of
their rude farmhomes their meager harvests and
their halfstabled cattle from the dread invasion of
the Indian Then too they had their mothers and
their wives and little ones to protect to clothe to
feed and to die for in this awful line of duty as
hundreds upon hundreds did These sad facts are
here accented and detailed not so much for the sake
of being tedious as to indicate more clearly why it
was that many of the truly heroic ancestors of our
best people grew unquestionably dialect of caste
not alone in speech but in every mental trait and
personal address It is a grievous fact for us to
confront but many of them wore apparel of the
commonest talked loudly and doubtless said thisaway
and thataway and Watch y doin of
and Whur yi goin atusing dialect even in
their prayers to Him who in His gentle mercy
listened and was pleased and who listens verily
unto this hour to all like prayers yet pleased yea
haply listens to the refined rhetorical petitions of
those who are NOT pleased

There is something more at fault than the language
when we turn from or flinch at it and as
has been intimated the wretched fault may be
skulkingly hidden away in the ambush of OSTENSIBLE
dialectthat type of dialect so copiously produced
by its sole manufacturers who utterly stark and
bare of the vaguest idea of country life or country
people at once assume that all their gifted pens
have to do is stupidly to misspell every word
vulgarly mistreat and besloven every theme however
sacred maim cripple and disfigure language never
in the vocabulary of the countrymanthen smuggle
these monstrosities of either rhyme or prose somehow
into the public print that is innocently to smear
them broadcast all over the face of the country they
insult

How different the mind and method of the true
intrepreter As this phrase goes down the man
himself arisesthe type perfectColonel Richard
Malcolm Johnston who wrote The Dukesborough
Talesan accomplished classical scholar and
teacher yet no less an accomplished master and
lover of his native dialect of middle Georgia He
like Dickens permits his rustic characters to think
talk act and live Just as nature designed them He
does not make the pitiable error of either
patronizing or making fun of them He knows them and
he loves them and they know and love him in
return Recalling Colonel Johnstons dialectic
sketches with his own presentation of them from
the platform the writer notes a fact that seems
singularly to obtain among all true dialectwriters
namely that they are also endowed with native
histrionic capabilities HEAR as well as read Twain
Cable Johnston Page Smith and all the list with
barely an exception

Did space permit no better illustration of true
dialect sketch and characterization might here be
offered than Colonel Johnstons simple story of
Mr Absalom Billingslea or the short and simple
annals of his like quaint contemporaries Mr Bill
Williams and Mr Jonas Lively The scene is
the country and the very little country town with
landscape atmosphere simplicity circumstanceall
surroundings and conditionsVERITABLEeverything
rural and dialectic no less than the simple
primitive common wholesomehearted men and women
who so naturally live and have their blessed being
in his stories just as in the life itself This is the
manifest work of the true dialect writer and
expounder In every detail the most minute such
work reveals the masterhand and heart of the
humanitarian as well as artistthe two are indissolubly
fusedand the result of such just treatment
of whatever lowly themes or characters we can but
love and loyally approve with all our human hearts Such masters
necessarily are rare and such ripe
perfecting as is here attained may be in part the
mellowing result of age and long observation
though it can be based upon the wisest purest
spirit of the man as well as artist

With no less approval should the work of Joel
Chandler Harris be regarded His touch alike is
ever reverential He has gathered up the bruised
and broken voices and the legends of the slave
and from his childheart he has affectionately
yielded them to us in all their eery beauty and
wild loveliness Through them we are made to
glorify the helpless and the weak and to revel in
their victories But better we are taught that even
in barbaric breasts there dwells inherently the sense
of right above wrongequity above lawand the
One Unerring Righteousness Eternal With equal
truth and strength too Mr Harris has treated the
dialectic elements of the interior Georgia country
the wilds and fastnesses of the moonshiners His
tale of Teague Poteet of some years ago was
contemporaneous with the list of striking mountain
stories from that strong and highly gifted Tennesseean
Miss Murfree or Charles Egbert Craddock
In the dialectic spirit her stories charm and
hold us Always there is strangely mingled but
most naturally the gentle nature cropping out amid
the most desperate and stoical the night scene in
the isolated mountain cabin guarded ever without
and within from any chance downswooping of the
minions of the redeyed law the great mangroup
of gentle giants with rifles never out of arms
reach in tender rivalry ranged admiringly around
the crowing wakeful little boybaby the return at
last of the belated mistress of the housethe sister
to whom all do great awkward reverence Jealously
snatching up the babe and kissing it she
querulously demands why he has not long ago been
put to bed He lowed he wouldnt go is the
reply

Thomas Nelson Page of Virginia who wrote
Meh Ladya positive classic in the negro dialect
his work is veritablestrong and pure and
sweet and as an oral reader of it the doubly gifted
author in voice and cadence natural utterance
every possible effect of speech and tone is doubtless
without rival anywhere

Many more indeed than may be mentioned now
there are of these real benefactors and preservers
of the wayside characters times and customs of our
evershifting history Needless is it to speak here of
the earlier of our workers in the dialectic lineof
James Russell Lowells New England Hosea Biglow
Dr Egglestons Hoosier SchoolMaster or
the very rare and quaint bright prattle of Helens
Babies In connection with this last let us very
seriously inquire what this real child has done that
Literature should so persistently refuse to give him
an abiding welcome Since for ages this question
seems to have been left unasked it may be timely
now to propound it Why not the real child in
Literature The real child is good enough we all
know he is bad enough to command our admiring
attention and most lively interest in real life and
just as we find him in the raw Then why do we
deny him any righteous place of recognition in our
Literature From the immemorial advent of our
dear old Mother Goose Literature has been especially
catering to the juvenile needs and desires and
yet steadfastly overlooking all the time the very
principles upon which Nature herself founds and
presents this lawless little brood of hersthe
children It is not the children who are out of order
it is Literature And not only is Literature out of
order but she is presumptuous she is impudent
She takes Natures children and revises and corrects
them till their own mother doesnt know them
This is literal fact So very many of us are coming
to inquire as weve a right why is the real child
excluded from a just hearing in the world of letters
as he has in the world of fact For instance
what has the lovely little ragamuffin ever done of
sufficient guilt to consign him eternally to the
monstrous penalty of speaking most accurate grammar
all the literary hours of the days of the years of his
otherwise natural life

 Oh mother may I go to school
 With brother Charles today
 The air is very fine and cool
 Oh mother say I may

Is this a real boy that would make such a request
and is it the real language he would use No we
are glad to say that it is not Simply it is a libel
in every particular on any boy however fondly
and exactingly trained by parents however zealous
for his overdecorous future Better indeed the
dubious sentiment of the most trivial nursery jingle
since the latter at least maintains the lawless though
wholesome spirit of the childgenuine

 Hink Minx The old witch winks
 The fat begins to fry
 Theres nobody home but Jumping Joan
 Father and mother and I

Though even here the impious poet leaves the scar
of grammatical knowledge upon childhoods native
diction and so the helpless little fellow is again
misrepresented and his character to all intents and
purposes is assaulted and maligned outrageously
thereby

Now in all seriousness this situation ought not
to be permitted to exist though to change it seems
an almost insurmountable task The general public
very probably is not aware of the real gravity of
the position of the case as even unto this day it
exists Let the public try then to contribute the
real child to the socalled Child Literature of its
country and have its real child returned as promptly
as it dare show its little tousled head in the presence
of that scholarly and dignified institution Then
ask why your real child has been spanked back
home again and the wise mentors there will virtually
tell you that Child Literature wants no real children in it that
the real childs example of
defective grammar and lack of elegant deportment
would furnish to its little patrician patrons suggestions
very hurtful indeed to their higher morals
tendencies and ambitions Then although the general
public couldnt for the life of it see why or
how and might even be reminded that it was just
such a rowdying child itself and that its FATHER
the Father of his Countrywas just such a child
that Abraham Lincoln was just such a lovable lawless
child and yet was blessed and chosen in the
end for the highest service man may ever render
unto manallall this argument would avail not
in the least since the elegantly minded purveyors
of Child Literature can not possibly tolerate the
presence of any but the refined childrenthe very
proper childrenthe studiously thoughtful poetic
childrenand these must be kept safe from the
contaminating touch of our roughandtumble little
fellows in hodden gray with frowzly heads
begrimed but laughing faces and such awful awful
vulgarities of naturalness and crimes of simplicity
and brazen faith and trust and love of life and
everybody in it All other real people are getting
into Literature and without some real children
along will they not soon be getting lonesome too
