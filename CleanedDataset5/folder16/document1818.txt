THE SPY


By Richard Harding Davis



My going to Valencia was entirely an accident But the more often I
stated that fact the more satisfied was everyone at the capital that I
had come on some secret mission Even the venerable politician who
acted as our minister the night of my arrival after dinner said
confidentially Now Mr Crosby between ourselves whats the game

Whats what game I asked

You know what I mean he returned What are you here for

But when for the tenth time I repeated how I came to be marooned in
Valencia he showed that his feelings were hurt and said stiffly As
you please Suppose we join the ladies

And the next day his wife reproached me with I should think you could
trust your own minister My husband NEVER talksnot even to me

So I see I said

And then her feelings were hurt also and she went about telling people
I was an agent of the WalkerKeefe crowd

My only reason for repeating here that my going to Valencia was an
accident is that it was because Schnitzel disbelieved that fact and
to drag the hideous facts from me followed me back to New York Through
that circumstance I came to know him and am able to tell his story

The simple truth was that I had been sent by the State Department to
Panama to go look see and straighten out a certain conflict of
authority among the officials of the canal zone While I was there
the yellowfever broke out and every selfrespecting power clapped a
quarantine on the Isthmus with the result that when I tried to return
to New York no steamer would take me to any place to which any white man
would care to go But I knew that at Valencia there was a direct line to
New York so I took a tramp steamer down the coast to Valencia I went
to Valencia only because to me every other port in the world was closed
My position was that of the man who explained to his wife that he came
home because the other places were shut

But because formerly in Valencia I had held a minor post in our
legation and because the State Department so constantly consults our
firm on questions of international law it was believed I revisited
Valencia on some mysterious and secret mission

As a matter of fact had I gone there to sell phonographs or to start a
steam laundry I should have been as greatly suspected For in Valencia
even every commercial salesman from the moment he gives up his passport
on the steamer until the police permit him to depart is suspected
shadowed and begirt with spies

I believe that during my brief visit I enjoyed the distinction
of occupying the undivided attention of three a common or garden
Government spy from whom no guilty man escapes a WalkerKeefe spy
and the spy of the Nitrate Company The spy of the Nitrate Company is
generally a man you meet at the legations and clubs He plays bridge
and is dignified with the title of agent The WalkerKeefe spy is
ostensibly a travelling salesman or hotel runner The Government spy is
just a spya scowling important little beast in a white duck suit and
a diamond ring The limit of his intelligence is to follow you into a
cigar store and note what cigar you buy and in what kind of money you
pay for it

The reason for it all was the threecornered fight which then was being
waged by the Government the Nitrate Trust and the WalkerKeefe crowd
for the possession of the nitrate beds Valencia is so near to the
equator and so far from New York that there are few who studied the
intricate story of that disgraceful struggle which I hasten to add
with the fear of libel before my eyes I do not intend to tell now

Briefly it was a triangular fight between opponents each of whom was in
the wrong and each of whom to gain his end bribed blackmailed and
robbed not only his adversaries but those of his own side the end in
view being the possession of those great deposits that lie in the
rocks of Valencia baked from above by the tropic sun and from below by
volcanic fires As one of their engineers one night in the Plaza said
to me Those mines were conceived in hell and stink to heaven and
the reputation of every man of us that has touched them smells like the
mines

At the time I was there the situation was acute In Valencia the
situation always is acute but this time it looked as though something
might happen On the day before I departed the Nitrate Trust had cabled
vehemently for warships the Minister of Foreign Affairs had refused to
receive our minister and at Porto Banos a mob had made the tin sign of
the United States consulate look like a sieve Our minister urged me to
remain To be bombarded by ones own warships he assured me would be
a thrilling experience

But I repeated that my business was with Panama not Valencia and that
if in this matter of his row I had any weight at Washington as between
preserving the nitrate beds for the trust and preserving for his
country and various sweethearts one brownthroated cleanlimbed
bluejacket I was for the bluejacket

Accordingly when I sailed from Valencia the aged diplomat would have
described our relations as strained

Our ship was a slow ship listed to touch at many ports and as early as
noon on the following day we stopped for cargo at Trujillo It was there
I met Schnitzel

In Panama I had bought a macaw for a little niece of mine and while we
were taking on cargo I went ashore to get a tin cage in which to put
it and for direction called upon our consul From an inner room he
entered excitedly smiling at my card and asked how he might serve me
I told him I had a parrot below decks and wanted to buy a tin cage

Exactly You want a tin cage the consul repeated soothingly The
State Department doesnt keep me awake nights cabling me what its
going to do he said but at least I know it doesnt send a
thousanddollaraminute fourcylinder lawyer all the way to this fever
swamp to buy a tin cage Now honest how can I serve you I saw it was
hopeless No one would believe the truth To offer it to this friendly
soul would merely offend his feelings and his intelligence

So with much mystery I asked him to describe the situation and he
did so with the exactness of one who believes that within an hour every
word he speaks will be cabled to the White House

When I was leaving he said Oh theres a newspaper correspondent after
you He wants an interview I guess He followed you last night from the
capital by train You want to watch out he dont catch you His name is
Jones I promised to be on my guard against a man named Jones and
the consul escorted me to the ship As he went down the accommodation
ladder I called over the rail In case they SHOULD declare war cable
to Curacoa and Ill come back And dont cable anything indefinite
like Situation critical or War imminent Understand Cable me Come
back or Go ahead But whatever you cable make it CLEAR

He shook his head violently and with his greenlined umbrella pointed at
my elbow I turned and found a young man hungrily listening to my words
He was leaning on the rail with his chin on his arms and the brim of his
Panama hat drawn down to conceal his eyes

On the pierhead from which we now were drawing rapidly away the
consul made a megaphone of his hands

Thats HIM he called Thats Jones

Jones raised his head and I saw that the tropical heat had made Jones
thirsty or that with friends he had been celebrating his departure He
winked at me and apparently with pleasure at his own discernment and
with pity for me smiled

Oh of course he murmured His tone was one of heavy irony Make it
clear Make it clear to the whole wharf Shout it out sos everybody
can hear you Youre clear enough His disgust was too deep for
ordinary words My uncle he exclaimed

By this I gathered that he was expressing his contempt

I beg your pardon I said

We had the deck to ourselves Its emptiness suddenly reminded me that
we had the ship also to ourselves I remembered the purser had told me
that except for those who travelled overnight from port to port I was
his only passenger

With dismay I pictured myself for ten days adrift on the high
seasalone with Jones

With a dramatic gesture as one would say I am here he pushed back
his Panama hat With an unsteady finger he pointed as it was drawn
dripping across the deck at the stern hawser

You see that rope he demanded Soon as that rope hit the water I
knocked off work Slong as you was in Valenciame on the job Now
YOU cant go back I cant go back Why further dissimlation WHO AM
I

His condition seemed to preclude the possibility of his knowing who he
was so I told him

He sneered as I have seen men sneer only in melodrama

Oh of course he muttered Oh of course

He lurched toward me indignantly

You know perfecly well Jones is not my name You know perfecly well
who I am

My dear sir I said I dont know anything about you except that
your are a damned nuisance

He swayed from me pained and surprised Apparently he was upon an
outbreak of tears

Proud he murmured AND haughty Proud and haughty to the last

I never have understood why an intoxicated man feels the climax of
insult is to hurl at you your name Perhaps because he knows it is the
one charge you cannot deny But invariably before you escape as though
assured the words will cover your retreat with shame he throws at you
your full title Jones did this

Slowly and mercilessly he repeated MrGeorgeMorganCrosby Of
Harvard he added Proud and haughty to the last

He then embraced a passing steward and demanded to be informed why the
ship rolled He never knew a ship to roll as our ship rolled

Perfecly satisfactry ocean but shiprolling like a stonebreaker
Take me some place in the ship where this ship dont roll

The steward led him away

When he had dropped the local pilot the captain beckoned me to the
bridge

I saw you talking to Mr Schnitzel he said Hes a little under the
weather He has too light a head for liquors

I agreed that he had a light head and said I understood his name was
Jones

Thats what I wanted to tell you said the captain His name is
Schnitzel He used to work for the Nitrate Trust in New York Then
he came down here as an agent Hes a good boy not to tell things to
Understand Sometimes I carry him under one name and the next voyage
under another The purser and he fix it up between em It pleases him
and it dont hurt anybody else so long as I tell them about it I dont
know who hes working for now he went on but I know hes not with
the Nitrate Company any more He sold them out

How could he I asked Hes only a boy

He had a berth as typewriter to Senator Burnsides president of the
Nitrate Trust sort of confidential stenographer said the captain
Whenever the senator dictated an important letter they say Schnitzel
used to make a carbon copy and when he had enough of them he sold them
to the WalkerKeefe crowd Then when WalkerKeefe lost their suit in
the Valencia Supreme Court I guess Schnitzel went over to President
Alvarez And again some folks say hes back with the Nitrate Company

After he sold them out

Yes but you see hes worth more to them now He knows all the
WalkerKeefe secrets and Alvarezs secrets too

I expressed my opinion of every one concerned

It shouldnt surprise YOU complained the captain You know the
country Every man in it is out for something that isnt his The pilot
wants his bit the health doctor must get his the customs take all your
cigars and if you dont put up gold for the captain of the port and the
alcalde and the commandant and the harbor police and the foreman of the
cargadores they wont move a lighter and theyll hold up the ships
papers Well an American comes down here honest and straight and
willing to work for his wages But pretty quick he finds every one
is getting his squeeze but him so he tries to get some of it back by
robbing the natives that robbed him Then he robs the other foreigners
and it aint long before hes cheating the people at home who sent him
here There isnt a man in this nitrate row that isnt robbing the crowd
hes with and that wouldnt change sides for money Schnitzels no
worse than the president nor the canteen contractor

He waved his hand at the glaring coastline at the steaming swamps and
the hot naked mountains

Its the country that does it he said Its in the air You can
smell it as soon as you drop anchor like you smell the slaughterhouse
at PuntaArenas

How do YOU manage to keep honest I asked smiling

I dont take any chances exclaimed the captain seriously When Im
in their damned port I dont go ashore

I did not again see Schnitzel until with haggard eyes and suspiciously
wet hair he joined the captain doctor purser and myself at
breakfast In the phrases of the Tenderloin he told us cheerfully that
he had been grandly intoxicated and to recover drank mixtures of
raw egg vinegar and red pepper the sight of which took away every
appetite save his own When to this he had added a bottle of beer he
declared himself a new man The new man followed me to the deck and
with the truculent bearing of one who expects to be repelled he asked
if the day before he had not made a fool of himself

I suggested he had been somewhat confidential At once he recovered his
pose and patronized me

Dont you believe it he said Thats all part of my game
Confidence for confidence is the way I work it Thats how I learn
things I tell a man something on the inside and he says Heres
a nice young fellow Nothing standoffish about him and he tells me
something he shouldnt Like as not what I told him wasnt true See

I assured him he interested me greatly

You find then in your line of business I asked that apparent
frankness is advisable As a rule I explained secrecy is what aa
person in your linea

To save his feelings I hesitated at the word

A spy he said His face beamed with fatuous complacency

But if I had not known you were a spy I asked would not that have
been better for you

In dealing with a party like you Mr Crosby Schnitzel began
sententiously I use a different method Youre on a secret mission
yourself and you get your information about the nitrate row one way
and I get it another I deal with you just like we were drummers in the
same line of goods We are rivals in business but outside of business
hours perfect gentleman

In the face of the disbelief that had met my denials of any secret
mission I felt to have Schnitzel also disbelieve me would be too great
a humiliation So I remained silent

You make your report to the State Department he explained and I
make mine tomy people Who they are doesnt matter Youd like to
know and I dont want to hurt your feelings butthats MY secret

My only feelings were a desire to kick Schnitzel heavily but for
Schnitzel to suspect that was impossible Rather he pictured me as
shaken by his disclosures

As he hung over the rail the glare of the sun on the tumbling water lit
up his foolish mongrel features exposed their cunning their utter
lack of any character and showed behind the shifty eyes the vacant
halfcrooked mind

Schnitzel was smiling to himself with a smile of complete
selfsatisfaction In the light of his later conduct I grew to
understand that smile He had anticipated a rebuff and he had been
received as he read it with consideration The irony of my politeness
he had entirely missed Instead he read in what I said the admiration
of the amateur for the professional He saw what he believed to be a
high agent of the Government treating him as a worthy antagonist In no
other way can I explain his later heaping upon me his confidences It
was the vanity of a child trying to show off

In ten days in the limited area of a twothousandton steamer one
could not help but learn something of the history of so communicative a
fellowpassenger as Schnitzel His parents were German and still lived
in Germany But he himself had been brought up on the East Side An
uncle who kept a delicatessen shop in Avenue A had sent him to the
public schools and then to a business college where he had developed
remarkable expertness as a stenographer He referred to his skill in
this difficult exercise with pitying contempt Nevertheless from a
room noisy with typewriters this skill had lifted him into the private
office of the president of the Nitrate Trust There as Schnitzel
expressed it I saw mine and I took it To trace back the criminal
instinct that led Schnitzel to steal and sell the private letters of
his employer was not difficult In all of his few early years I found it
lying latent Of every story he told of himself and he talked only of
himself there was not one that was not to his discredit He himself
never saw this nor that all he told me showed he was without the moral
sense and with an instinctive enjoyment of what was deceitful mean
and underhand That as I read it was his character

In appearance he was smoothshaven with long locks that hung behind
wide protruding ears He had the unhealthy skin of bad blood and his
eyes as though the daylight hurt them constantly opened and shut He
was like hundreds of young men that you see loitering on upper Broadway
and making predatory raids along the Rialto Had you passed him in that
neighborhood you would have set him down as a wiretapper a racing
tout a wouldbe actor

As I worked it out Schnitzel was a spy because it gave him an
importance he had not been able to obtain by any other effort As a
child and as a clerk it was easy to see that among his associates
Schnitzel must always have been the butt Until suddenly by one dirty
action he had placed himself outside their class As he expressed it
Whenever I walk through the office now where all the stenographers
sit you ought to see those slobs look after me When they go to the
presidents door they got to knock like I used to but now when the
old man sees me coming to make my report after one of these trips he
calls out Come right in Mr Schnitzel And like as not I go in with
my hat on and offer him a cigar An they see me do it too

To me that speech seemed to give Schnitzels view of the values of his
life His vanity demanded he be pointed at if even with contempt But
the contempt never reached himhe only knew that at last people took
note of him They no longer laughed at him they were afraid of him In
his heart he believed that they regarded him as one who walked in the
dark places of world politics who possessed an evil knowledge of great
men as evil as himself as one who by blackmail held public ministers at
his mercy

This view of himself was the one that he tried to give me I probably
was the first decent man who ever had treated him civilly and to
impress me with his knowledge he spread that knowledge before me It was
sale shocking degrading

At first I took comfort in the thought that Schnitzel was a liar Later
I began to wonder if all of it were a lie and finally in a way I could
not doubt it was proved to me that the worst he charged was true

The night I first began to believe him was the night we touched at
Cristobal the last port in Valencia In the most lighthearted manner
he had been accusing all concerned in the nitrate fight with every crime
known in Wall Street and in the dark reaches of the Congo River

But I know him Mr Schnitzel I said sternly He is incapable of
it I went to college with him

I dont care whether hes a rahrah boy or not said Schnitzel I
know thats what he did when he was up the Orinoco after orchids and
if the tribe had ever caught him theyd have crucified him And I know
this too he made forty thousand dollars out of the Nitrate Company on
a tenthousanddollar job And I know it because he beefed to me about
it himself because it wasnt big enough

We were passing the limestone island at the entrance to the harbor
where in the prison fortress with its muzzleloading guns pointing
drunkenly at the sky are buried the political prisoners of Valencia

Now there said Schnitzel pointing that shows you what the Nitrate
Trust can do Judge Rojas is in there He gave the first decision in
favor of the WalkerKeefe people and for making that decision William
T Scott the Nitrate manager made Alvarez put Rojas in there Hes
seventy years old and hes been there five years The cell they keep
him in is below the sealevel and the saltwater leaks through the
wall Ive seen it Thats what William T Scott did an up in New York
people think Billy Scott is a fine man I seen him at the Horse Show
sitting in a box bowing to everybody with his wife sitting beside him
all hung out with pearls An that was only a month after Id seen Rojas
in that sewer where Scott put him

Schnitzel I laughed you certainly are a magnificent liar

Schnitzel showed no resentment

Go ashore and look for yourself he muttered Dont believe me
Ask Rojas Ask the first man you meet He shivered and shrugged his
shoulders I tell you the walls are damp like sweat

The Government had telegraphed the commandant to come on board and as
he expressed it offer me the hospitality of the port which meant
that I had to take him to the smokingroom and give him champagne What
the Government really wanted was to find out whether I was still on
board and if it were finally rid of me

I asked the official concerning Judge Rojas

Oh yes he said readily He is still incomunicado

Without believing it would lead to anything I suggested

It was foolish of him to give offence to Mr Scott

The commandant nodded vivaciously

Mr Scott is very powerful man he assented We all very much love
Mr Scott The president he love Mr Scott too but the judges were
not sympathetic to Mr Scott so Mr Scott asked our president to give
them a warning and Senor Rojashe is the warning

When will he get out I asked

The commandant held up the glass in the sunlight from the open airport
and gazed admiringly at the bubbles

Who can tell he said Any day when Mr Scott wishes Maybe never
Senor Rojas is an old man Old and he has much rheumatics Maybe he
will never come out to see our beloved country any more

As we left the harbor we passed so close that one could throw a stone
against the wall of the fortress The sun was just sinking and the air
became suddenly chilled Around the little island of limestone the waves
swept through the seaweed and black manigua up to the rusty bars of the
cells I saw the barefooted soldiers smoking upon the sloping ramparts
the common criminals in a long stumbling line bearing kegs of water
three stormbeaten palms rising like gallows and the green and yellow
flag of Valencia crawling down the staff Somewhere entombed in that
blotched and mildewed masonry an old man of seventy years was shivering
and hugging himself from the damp and cold A man who spoke five
languages a just brave gentleman To me it was no new story I knew
of the horrors of Cristobal prison of political rivals chained to
criminals loathsome with disease of men who had raised the flag of
revolution driven to suicide But never had I supposed that my own
people could reach from the city of New York and cast a fellowman into
that cellar of fever and madness

As I watched the yellow wall sink into the sea I became conscious that
Schnitzel was near me as before leaning on the rail with his chin
sunk on his arms His face was turned toward the fortress and for the
first time since I had known him it was set and serious And when a
moment later he passed me without recognition I saw that his eyes were
filled with fear

When we touched at Curacoa I sent a cable to my sister announcing the
date of my arrival and then continued on to the Hotel Venezuela Almost
immediately Schnitzel joined me With easy carelessness he said I was
in the cable office just now sending off a wire and that operator told
me he cant make head or tail of the third word in your cable

That is strange I commented because its a French word and he is
French Thats why I wrote it in French

With the air of one who nails another in a falsehood Schnitzel
exclaimed

Then how did you suppose your sister was going to read it Its a
cipher thats what it is Oh no YOURE not on a secret mission Not
at all

It was most undignified of me but in five minutes I excused myself and
sent to the State Department the following words

Roses red violets blue send snow

Later at the State Department the only person who did not eventually
pardon my jest was the clerk who had sat up until three in the morning
with my cable trying to fit it to any known code

Immediately after my return to the Hotel Venezuela Schnitzel excused
himself and half an hour later returned in triumph with the cable
operator and ordered lunch for both They imbibed much sweet champagne

When we again were safe at sea I said Schnitzel how much did you pay
that Frenchman to let you read my second cable

Schnitzels reply was prompt and complacent

One hundred dollars gold It was worth it Do you want to know how I
doped it out

I even challenged him to do so Roses redwar declared violets
blueoutlook bad or blue send snowsend squadron because the
white squadron is white like snow See It was too easy

Schnitzel I cried you are wonderful

Schnitzel yawned in my face

Oh you dont have to hit the soles of my feet with a nightstick to
keep me awake he said

After I had been a week at sea I found that either I had to believe
that in all things Schnitzel was a liar or that the men of the Nitrate
Trust were in all things evil I was convinced that instead of the
people of Valencia robbing them they were robbing both the people of
Valencia and the people of the United States

To go to war on their account was to degrade our Government I explained
to Schnitzel it was not becoming that the United States navy should be
made the catspaw of a corrupt corporation I asked his permission to
repeat to the authorities at Washington certain of the statements he had
made

Schnitzel was greatly pleased

Youre welcome to tell em anything Ive said he assented And he
added most of its true too

I wrote down certain charges he had made and added what I had always
known of the nitrate fight It was a terrible arraignment In
the evening I read my notes to Schnitzel who in a corner of the
smokingroom sat frowning importantly checking off each statement
and where I made an error of a date or a name severely correcting me

Several times I asked him Are you sure this wont get you into trouble
with your people You seem to accuse everybody on each side

Schnitzels eyes instantly closed with suspicion

Dont you worry about me and my people he returned sulkily Thats
MY secret and you wont find it out neither I may be as crooked as
the rest of them but Im not giving away my employer

I suppose I looked puzzled

I mean not a second time he added hastily I know what youre
thinking of and I got five thousand dollars for it But now I mean to
stick by the men that pay my wages

But youve told me enough about each of the three to put any one of
them in jail

Of course I have cried Schnitzel triumphantly

If Id let down on any one crowd youd know I was working for that
crowd so Ive touched em all up Only what I told you about my
crowdisnt true

The report we finally drew up was so sensational that I was of a mind
to throw it overboard It accused members of the Cabinet of our Senate
diplomats business men of national interest judges of the Valencia
courts private secretaries clerks hired bullies and filibusters
Men the trust could not bribe it had blackmailed Those it could not
corrupt and they were pitifully few it crushed with some disgraceful
charge

Looking over my notes I said

You seem to have made every charge except murder

Howd I come to leave that out Schnitzel answered flippantly
What about Coleman the foreman at Bahia and that German contractor
Ebhardt and old Smedburg They talked too much and they died of
yellowfever maybe and maybe what happened to them was they ate
knockout drops in their soup

I disbelieved him but there came a sudden nasty doubt

Curtis who managed the companys plant at Barcelona died of
yellowfever I said and was buried the same day

For some time Schnitzel glowered uncertainly at the bulkhead

Did you know him he asked

When I was in the legation I knew him well I said

So did I said Schnitzel He wasnt murdered He murdered himself He
was wrong ten thousand dollars in his accounts He got worrying about it
and we found him outside the clearing with a hole in his head He left a
note saying he couldnt bear the disgrace As if the company would hold
a little grafting against as good a man as Curtis

Schnitzel coughed and pretended it was his cigarette

You see you dont put in nothing against him he added savagely

It was the first time I had seen Schnitzel show emotion and I was moved
to preach

Why dont you quit I said You had an A1 job as a stenographer Why
dont you go back to it

Maybe some day But its great being your own boss If I was a
stenographer I wouldnt be helping you send in a report to the State
Department would I No this job is all right They send you after
something big and you have the devil of a time getting it but when you
get it you feel like you had picked a hundredtoone shot

The talk or the drink had elated him His fishlike eyes bulged and
shone He cast a quick look about him Except for ourselves the
smokingroom was empty From below came the steady throb of the engines
and from outside the whisper of the waves and of the wind through the
cordage A barefooted sailor pattered by to the bridge Schnitzel bent
toward me and with his hand pointed to his throat

Ive got papers on me thats worth a million to a certain party he
whispered You understand my notes in cipher

He scowled with intense mystery

I keep em in an oiledsilk bag tied around my neck with a string
And here he added hastily patting his hip as though to forestall any
attack I might make upon his person I carry my automatic It shoots
nine bullets in five seconds They got to be quick to catch me

Well if you have either of those things on you I said testily I
dont want to know it How often have I told you not to talk and drink
at the same time

Ah go on laughed Schnitzel Thats an old gag warning a fellow not
to talk so as to MAKE him talk I do that myself

That Schnitzel had important papers tied to his neck I no more believe
than that he wore a shirt of chain armor but to please him I pretended
to be greatly concerned

Now that were getting into New York I said you must be very
careful A man who carries such important documents on his person might
be murdered for them I think you ought to disguise yourself

A picture of my bag being carried ashore by Schnitzel in the uniform of
a ships steward rather pleased me

Go on youre kidding said Schnitzel He was drawn between believing
I was deeply impressed and with fear that I was mocking him

On the contrary I protested I dont feel quite safe myself Seeing
me with you they may think I have papers around MY neck

They wouldnt look at you Schnitzel reassured me They know youre
just an amateur But as you say with me its different I GOT to be
careful Now you mightnt believe it but I never go near my uncle nor
none of my friends that live where I used to hang out If I did the
other spies would get on my track I suppose he went on grandly I
never go out in New York but that at least two spies are trailing me
But I know how to throw them off I live way down town in a little
hotel you never heard of You never catch me dining at Sherrys nor the
Waldorf And you never met me out socially did you now

I confessed I had not

And then I always live under an assumed name

Like Jones I suggested

Well sometimes Jones he admitted

To me I said Jones lacks imagination Its the sort of name you
give when youre arrested for exceeding the speed limit Why dont you
call yourself Machiavelli

Go on Im no dago said Schnitzel and dont you go off thinking
Jones is the only disguise I use But Im not tellin what it is am
I Oh no

Schnitzel I asked have you ever been told that you would make a
great detective

Cut it out said Schnitzel Youve been reading those fairy stories
Theres no fly cops nor Pinks could do the work I do Theyre pikers
compared to me They chase pettylarceny cases and kick in doors I
wouldnt stoop to what they do Its being mixed up the way I am
with the problems of two governments that catches me He added
magnanimously You see something of that yourself

We left the ship at Brooklyn and with regret I prepared to bid
Schnitzel farewell Seldom had I met a little beast so offensive but
his vanity his lies his moral blindness made one pity him And in ten
days in the smokingroom together we had had many friendly drinks and
many friendly laughs He was going to a hotel on lower Broadway and
as my cab on my way uptown passed the door I offered him a lift
He appeared to consider the advisability of this and then with much
byplay of glancing over his shoulder dived into the front seat and
drew down the blinds This hotel I am going to is an oldfashioned
trap he explained but the clerk is wise to me understand and I
dont have to sign the register

As we drew nearer to the hotel he said Its a pity we cant dine out
somewheres and go to the theatre butyou know

With almost too much heartiness I hastily agreed it would be imprudent

I understand perfectly I assented You are a marked man Until you
get those papers safe in the hands of your people you must be very
cautious

Thats right he said Then he smiled craftily

I wonder if youre on yet to which my people are

I assured him that I had no idea but that from the avidity with which
he had abused them I guessed he was working for the WalkerKeefe crowd

He both smiled and scowled

Dont you wish you knew he said Ive told you a lot of inside
stories Mr Crosby but Ill never tell on my pals again Not me
Thats MY secret

At the door of the hotel he bade me a hasty goodby and for a few
minutes I believed that Schnitzel had passed out of my life forever
Then in taking account of my belongings I missed my fieldglasses I
remembered that in order to open a trunk for the customs inspectors
I had handed them to Schnitzel and that he had hung them over his
shoulder In our haste at parting we both had forgotten them

I was only a few blocks from the hotel and I told the man to return

I inquired for Mr Schnitzel and the clerk who apparently knew him by
that name said he was in his room number eightytwo

But he has a caller with him now he added A gentleman was waiting
for him ands just gone up

I wrote on my card why I had called and soon after it had been borne
skyward the clerk said I guess hell be able to see you now Thats
the party that was calling on him there

He nodded toward a man who crossed the rotunda quickly His face was
twisted from us as though as he almost ran toward the street he were
reading the advertisements on the wall

He reached the door and was lost in the great tide of Broadway

I crossed to the elevator and as I stood waiting it descended with a
crash and the boy who had taken my card flung himself shrieking into
the rotunda

That manstop him he cried The man in eightytwohes murdered

The clerk vaulted the desk and sprang into the street and I dragged the
boy back to the wire rope and we shot to the third story The boy shrank
back A chambermaid crouching against the wall her face colorless
lowered one hand and pointed at an open door

In there she whispered

In a mean common room stretched where he had been struck back upon the
bed I found the boy who had elected to meddle in the problems of two
governments

In tiny jets from three wide knifewounds his blood flowed slowly His
staring eyes were lifted up in fear and in entreaty I knew that he was
dying and as I felt my impotence to help him I as keenly felt a great
rage and a hatred toward those who had struck him

I leaned over him until my eyes were only a few inches from his face

Schnitzel I cried Who did this You can trust me Who did this
Quick

I saw that he recognized me and that there was something which with
terrible effort he was trying to make me understand

In the hall was the rush of many people running exclaiming the noise
of bells ringing from another floor the voice of a woman shrieked
hysterically

At the sounds the eyes of the boy grew eloquent with entreaty and with
a movement that called from each wound a fresh outburst like a man
strangling he lifted his fingers to his throat

Voices were calling for water to wait for the doctor to wait for the
police But I thought I understood

Still doubting him still unbelieving ashamed of my own credulity I
tore at his collar and my fingers closed upon a package of oiled silk

I stooped and with my teeth ripped it open and holding before him the
slips of paper it contained tore them into tiny shreds

The eyes smiled at me with cunning with triumph with deep content

It was so like the Schnitzel I had known that I believed still he might
have strength enough to help me

Who did this I begged Ill hang him for it Do you hear me I
cried

Seeing him lying there with the life cut out of him swept me with a
blind anger with a need to punish

Ill see they hang for it Tell me I commanded Who did this

The eyes now filled with weariness looked up and the lips moved
feebly

My own people he whispered

In my indignation I could have shaken the truth from him I bent closer

Then by God I whispered back youll tell me who they are

The eyes flashed sullenly

Thats my secret said Schnitzel

The eyes set and the lips closed

A man at my side leaned over him and drew the sheet across his face
