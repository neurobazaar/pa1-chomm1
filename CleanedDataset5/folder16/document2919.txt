AMERICAN That pears to be one up to democracy To the LITTLE
MAN I judge you go in for brotherhood

LITTLE MAN Startled Oh no

AMERICAN I take considerable stock in Leo Tolstoi myself Grand
mangrandsouled apparatus But I guess youve got to pinch those
waiters some to make em skip To the ENGLISH who have carelessly
looked his way for a moment Youll appreciate that the way he
acted about my eggs

 The ENGLISH make faint motions with their chins and avert their
 eyes

 To the WAITER who is standing at the door of the buffet

Waiter Flash of beerjump now

WAITER Schon

 He disappears

AMERICAN Affablyto the LITTLE MAN Now if I dont get that

AMERICAN Relishing the approach of argument Well that is a
matter of temperament Now Im all for equality See that poor
woman therevery humble womanthere she sits among us with her
baby Perhaps youd like to locate her somewhere else

GERMAN Shrugging Tolstoi is sentimentalisch Nietzsche is
the true philosopher the only one

AMERICAN Well thats quite in the prospectusvery stimulating
partyold Nietchvirgin mind But give me Leo He turns to the
redcheeked YOUTH What do you opine sir I guess by your labels
youll be Dutch Do they read Tolstoi in your country

 The DUTCH YOUTH laughs

AMERICAN That is a very luminous answer

GERMAN Tolstoi is nothing Man should himself express He must
pushhe must be strong

AMERICAN That is so In America we believe in virility we like a
man to expand But we believe in brotherhood too We draw the line
at niggers but we aspire Social barriers and distinctions weve
not much use for

ENGLISHMAN Do you feel a draught

ENGLISHWOMAN With a shiver of her shoulder toward the AMERICAN I
dorather

GERMAN Wait You are a young people

AMERICAN That is so there are no flies on us To the LITTLE MAN
who has been gazing eagerly from face to face Say Id like to
have you give us your sentiments in relation to the duty of man

 The LITTLE MAN fidgets and is about to opens his mouth

AMERICAN For exampleis it your opinion that we should kill off
the weak and diseased and all that cant jump around

GERMAN Nodding Ja ja That is coming

LITTLE MAN Looking from face to face They might be me

 The DUTCH YOUTH laughs

AMERICAN Reproving him with a look Thats true humility
Tisnt grammar Now heres a proposition that brings it nearer the
bone Would you step out of your way to help them when it was liable
to bring you trouble

GERMAN Nein nein That is stupid

LITTLE MAN Eager but wistful Im afraid not Of course one
wants toThere was St Francis dAssisi and St Julien LHospitalier
and

AMERICAN Very lofty dispositions Guess they died of them He
rises Shake hands sirmy name isHe hands a card I am an

WAITER Komm gleich

ENGLISHMAN Consulting watch Trains late

ENGLISHWOMAN Really Nuisance

 A station POLICEMAN very square and uniformed passes and
 repasses

much of that in America Guess we feel more to trust in human
nature

GERMAN Ah ha you will bresently find there is nothing in him
but self

LITTLE MAN Wistfully Dont you believe in human nature

AMERICAN Very stimulating question

 He looks round for opinions The DUTCH YOUTH laughs

ENGLISHMAN Holding out his half of the paper to his wife Swap

 His wife swaps

GERMAN In human nature I believe so far as I can see himno more

AMERICAN Now that pears to me kind o blasphemy I believe in
heroism I opine theres not one of us settin around here thats
not a herogive him the occasion

LITTLE MAN Oh Do you believe that

AMERICAN Well I judge a hero is just a person thatll help
another at the expense of himself Take that poor woman there
Well now shes a heroine I guess She would die for her baby any
old time

GERMAN Animals will die for their babies That is nothing

AMERICAN I carry it further I postulate we would all die for that
baby if a locomotive was to trundle up right here and try to handle
it To the GERMAN I guess you dont know how good you are As
the GERMAN is twisting up the ends of his moustacheto the
ENGLISHWOMAN I should like to have you express an opinion maam

ENGLISHWOMAN I beg your pardon

AMERICAN The English are very humanitarian they have a very high
sense of duty So have the Germans so have the Americans To the
DUTCH YOUTH I judge even in your little country they have that
This is an epoch of equality and hightoned ideals To the LITTLE
MAN What is your nationality sir

LITTLE MAN Im afraid Im nothing particular My father was
halfEnglish and halfAmerican and my mother halfGerman and
halfDutch

AMERICAN My Thats a bit streaky any old way The POLICEMAN
passes again Now I dont believe weve much use any more for those
gentlemen in buttons Weve grown kind of mildwe dont think of
self as we used to do

 The WAITER has appeared in the doorway

GERMAN In a voice of thunder Cigarren Donnerwetter

AMERICAN Shaking his fist at the vanishing WAITER That flash of
beer

WAITER Komm gleich

AMERICAN A little more and he will join George Washington I was
about to remark when he intruded In this year of grace 1913 the
kingdom of Christ is quite a going concern We are mighty near
universal brotherhood The colonel here He indicates the GERMAN is
a man of blood and iron but give him an opportunity to be
magnanimous and hell be right there Oh sir yep

 The GERMAN with a profound mixture of pleasure and cynicism
 brushes up the ends of his moustache

LITTLE MAN I wonder One wants to but somehowHe shakes his
head

AMERICAN You seem kind of skeery about that Youve had experience
maybe Im an optimistI think were bound to make the devil hum in
the near future I opine we shall occasion a good deal of trouble to
that old party Theres about to be a holocaust of selfish
interests The colonel there with oldman Nietch he wont know
himself Theres going to be a very sacred opportunity

 As he speaks the voice of a RAILWAY OFFICIAL is heard an the
 distance calling out in German It approaches and the words
 become audible

GERMAN Startled Der Teufel He gets up and seizes the bag
beside him

 The STATION OFFICIAL has appeared he stands for a moment
 casting his commands at the seated group The DUTCH YOUTH also
 rises and takes his coat and hat The OFFICIAL turns on his
 heel and retires still issuing directions

ENGLISHMAN What does he say

GERMAN Our drain has come in de oder platform only one minute we
haf

 All have risen in a fluster

AMERICAN Now thats very provoking I wont get that flash of
beer

 There is a general scurry to gather coats and hats and wraps
 during which the lowly WOMAN is seen making desperate attempts
 to deal with her baby and the two large bundles Quite
 defeated she suddenly puts all down wrings her hands and
 cries out Herr Jesu Hilfe The flying procession turn
 their heads at that strange cry

AMERICAN Whats that Help

 He continues to run The LITTLE MAN spins round rushes back
 picks up baby and bundle on which it was seated

LITTLE MAN Come along good woman come along

 The WOMAN picks up the other bundle and they run

 The WAITER appearing in the doorway with the bottle of beer
 watches with his tired smile


 CURTAIN




SCENE II

 A secondclass compartment of a corridor carriage in motion
 In it are seated the ENGLISHMAN and his WIFE opposite each
 other at the corridor end she with her face to the engine he
 with his back Both are somewhat protected from the rest of the
 travellers by newspapers Next to her sits the GERMAN and
 opposite him sits the AMERICAN next the AMERICAN in one window
 corner is seated the DUTCH YOUTH the other window corner is
 taken by the GERMANS bag The silence is only broken by the
 slight rushing noise of the trains progression and the
 crackling of the English newspapers

AMERICAN Turning to the DUTCH YOUTH Guess Id like that window
raised its kind of chilly after that old run they gave us

 The DUTCH YOUTH laughs and goes through the motions of raising
 the window The ENGLISH regard the operation with uneasy
 irritation The GERMAN opens his bag which reposes on the
 corner seat next him and takes out a book

AMERICAN The Germans are great readers Very stimulating practice
I read most anything myself

 The GERMAN holds up the book so that the title may be read

Don Quixotefine book We Americans take considerable stock in
old man Quixote Bit of a wildcatbut we dont laugh at him

GERMAN He is dead Dead as a sheep A good thing too

AMERICAN In America we have still quite an amount of chivalry

GERMAN Chivalry is nothing sentimentalisch In modern daysno
good A man must push he must pull

AMERICAN So you say But I judge your form of chivalry is
sacrifice to the state We allow more freedom to the individual
soul Where theres something little and weak we feel it kind of
noble to give up to it That way we feel elevated

 As he speaks there is seen in the corridor doorway the LITTLE
 MAN with the WOMANS BABY still on his arm and the bundle held
 in the other hand He peers in anxiously The ENGLISH acutely
 conscious try to dissociate themselves from his presence with
 their papers The DUTCH YOUTH laughs

GERMAN Ach So

AMERICAN Dear me

LITTLE MAN Is there room I cant find a seat

AMERICAN Why yes Theres a seat for one

LITTLE MAN Depositing bundle outside and heaving BABY May I

AMERICAN Come right in

 The GERMAN sulkily moves his bag The LITTLE MAN comes in and
 seats himself gingerly

AMERICAN Wheres the mother

LITTLE MAN Ruefully Afraid she got left behind

 The DUTCH YOUTH laughs The ENGLISH unconsciously emerge from
 their newspapers

AMERICAN My That would appear to be quite a domestic incident

 The ENGLISHMAN suddenly utters a profound Ha Ha and
 disappears behind his paper And that paper and the one
 opposite are seen to shake and little sguirls and squeaks
 emerge

GERMAN And you haf got her bundle and her baby Ha He cackles
drily

AMERICAN Gravely I smile I guess Providence has played it
pretty low down on you Its sure acted real mean

 The BABY wails and the LITTLE MAN jigs it with a sort of
 gentle desperation looking apologetically from face to face
 His wistful glance renews the fore of merriment wherever it
 alights The AMERICAN alone preserves a gravity which seems
 incapable of being broken

AMERICAN Maybe youd better get off right smart and restore that
baby Theres nothing can act madder than a mother

LITTLE MAN Poor thing yes What she must be suffering

 A gale of laughter shakes the carriage The ENGLISH for a
 moment drop their papers the better to indulge The LITTLE MAN
 smiles a wintry smile

AMERICAN In a lull How did it eventuate

LITTLE MAN We got there just as the train was going to start and I
jumped thinking I could help her up But it moved too quickly
andand left her

 The gale of laughter blows up again

AMERICAN Guess Id have thrown the baby out to her

LITTLE MAN I was afraid the poor little thing might break

 The Baby wails the LITTLE MAN heaves it the gale of laughter
 blows

AMERICAN Gravely Its highly entertainingnot for the baby
What kind of an old baby is it anyway He sniffs I judge its a
bitniffy

LITTLE MAN Afraid Ive hardly looked at it yet

AMERICAN Which end up is it

LITTLE MAM Oh I think the right end Yes yes it is

AMERICAN Well thats something Maybe you should hold it out of
window a bit Very excitable things babies

ENGLISHWOMAN Galvanized No no

ENGLISHMAN Touching her knee My dear

AMERICAN You are right maam I opine theres a draught out
there This baby is precious Weve all of us got stock in this
baby in a manner of speaking This is a little bit of universal
brotherhood Is it a woman baby

LITTLE MAN II can only see the top of its head

AMERICAN You cant always tell from that It looks kind of
overwrapped up Maybe it had better be unbound

GERMAN Nein nein nein

AMERICAN I think you are very likely right colonel It might be a
pity to unbind that baby I guess the lady should be consulted in
this matter

ENGLISHWOMAN Yes yes of course

ENGLISHMAN Touching her Let it be Little beggar seems all
right

AMERICAN That would seem only known to Providence at this moment
I judge it might be due to humanity to look at its face

LITTLE MAN Gladly Its sucking my finger There therenice
little thingthere

AMERICAN I would surmise in your leisure moments you have created
babies sir

LITTLE MAN Oh noindeed no

AMERICAN Dear meThat is a loss Addressing himself to the
carriage at large I think we may esteem ourselves fortunate to have
this little stranger right here with us Demonstrates what a hold
the little and weak have upon us nowadays The colonel herea man
of blood and ironthere he sits quite calm next door to it He
sniffs Now this baby is rather chasteningthat is a sign of
grace in the colonelthat is true heroism

LITTLE MAN Faintly II can see its face a little now

 All bend forward

AMERICAN What sort of a physiognomy has it anyway

LITTLE MAN Still faintly I dont see anything butbut spots

GERMAN Oh Ha Pfui

 The DUTCH YOUTH laughs

AMERICAN I am told that is not uncommon amongst babies Perhaps we
could have you inform us maam

ENGLISHWOMAN Yes of courseonly what sort of

LITTLE MAN They seem all over itsAt the slight recoil of
everyone I feel sure itsits quite a good baby underneath

AMERICAN That will be rather difficult to come at Im just a bit
sensitive Ive very little use for affections of the epidermis

GERMAN Pfui He has edged away as far as he can get and is
lighting a big cigar

 The DUTCH YOUTH draws his legs back

AMERICAN Also taking out a cigar I guess it would be well to
fumigate this carriage Does it suffer do you think

LITTLE MAN Peering Really I dontIm not sureI know so
little about babies I think it would have a nice expressionifif
it showed

AMERICAN Is it kind of boiled looking

LITTLE MAN Yesyes it is

AMERICAN Looking gravely round I judge this baby has the
measles

 The GERMAN screws himself spasmodically against the arm of the
 ENGLISHWOMANS seat

ENGLISHWOMAN Poor little thing Shall I

 She half rises

ENGLISHMAN Touching her No noDash it

AMERICAN I honour your emotion maam It does credit to us all
But I sympathize with your husband too The measles is a very
important pestilence in connection with a grown woman

LITTLE MAN It likes my finger awfully Really its rather a sweet
baby

AMERICAN Sniffing Well that would appear to be quite a
question About them spots now Are they rosy

LITTLE MAN Noo theyre dark almost black

GERMAN Gott Typhus He bounds up on to the arm of the
ENGLISHWOMANS Seat

AMERICAN Typhus Thats quite an indisposition

 The DUTCH YOUTH rises suddenly and bolts out into the
 corridor He is followed by the GERMAN puffing clouds of
 smoke The ENGLISH and AMERICAN sit a moment longer without
 speaking The ENGLISHWOMANS face is turned with a curious
 expressionhalf pity half feartowards the LITTLE MAN Then
 the ENGLISHMAN gets up

ENGLISHMAN Bit stuffy for you here dear isnt it

 He puts his arm through hers raises her and almost pushes her
 through the doorway She goes still looking back

AMERICAN Gravely Theres nothing I admire moren courage Guess
Ill go and smoke in the corridor

 As he goes out the LITTLE MAN looks very wistfully after him
 Screwing up his mouth and nose he holds the BABY away from him
 and wavers then rising he puts it on the seat opposite and
 goes through the motions of letting down the window Having
 done so he looks at the BABY who has begun to wail Suddenly
 he raises his hands and clasps them like a child praying
 Since however the BABY does not stop wailing he hovers over
 it in indecision then picking it up sits down again to dandle
 it with his face turned toward the open window Finding that
 it still wails he begins to sing to it in a cracked little
 voice It is charmed at once While he is singing the
 AMERICAN appears in the corridor Letting down the passage
 window he stands there in the doorway with the draught blowing
 his hair and the smoke of his cigar all about him The LITTLE
 MAN stops singing and shifts the shawl higher to protect the
 BABYS head from the draught

AMERICAN Gravely This is the most sublime spectacle I have ever
envisaged There ought to be a record of this

 The LITTLE MAN looks at him wondering You are typical sir
 of the sentiments of modern Christianity You illustrate the
 deepest feelings in the heart of every man

 The LITTLE MAN rises with the BABY and a movement of approach

Guess Im wanted in the diningcar

 He vanishes The LITTLE MAN sits down again but back to the
 engine away from the draught and looks out of the window
 patiently jogging the BABY On his knee


 CURTAIN

MAN with a sweep of his arm This is a white man Hes got a black
baby and he won leave it in the lurch Guess we would all act
noble that way give us the chance

 The LITTLE MAN rises holding out the BABY and advances a step

 AMERICAN climbs on to a higher trunk The LITTLE MAN retires
 and again sits down

AMERICAN Addressing the OFFICIAL Guess youd better go out of
business and wait for the mother

AMERICAN My Thats wonderful What a man this is What a

 The DUTCH YOUTH laughs The OFFICIAL turns on him but as he
 does so the MOTHER of the Busy is seen hurrying

MOTHER Ach Ach Mei Bubi

 Her face is illumined she is about to rush to the LITTLE MAN

OFFICIAL To the POLICEMAN Nimm die Frau

 The POLICEMAN catches hold of the WOMAN

OFFICIAL To the frightened WOMAN Warum haben Sie einen Buben mit
Typhus mit ausgebracht

AMERICAN Eagerly from his perch What was that I dont want to

 them on the BABY

 The BABY exchanging the warmth of the LITTLE MAN for the
 momentary chill of its MOTHER wails

OFFICIAL Descending and beckoning to the POLICEMAN Sie wollen
den Herrn accusiren

 The POLICEMAN takes the LITTLE MANs arm

AMERICAN Whats that They goin to pitch him after all

 The MOTHER still hugging her BABY who has stopped crying
 gazes at the LITTLE MAN who sits dazedly looking up Suddenly
 she drops on her knees and with her free hand lifts his booted
 foot and kisses it

AMERICAN Waving his hat Ra Ra He descends swiftly goes up
to the LITTLE MAN whose arm the POLICEMAN has dropped and takes his
hand Brother I am proud to know you This is one of the greatest
moments I have ever experienced Displaying the LITTLE MAN to the
assembled company I think I sense the situation when I say that we
all esteem it an honour to breathe the rather inferior atmosphere of
this station here Along with our little friend I guess we shall all
go home and treasure the memory of his face as the whitest thing in
our museum of recollections And perhaps this good woman will also
go home and wash the face of our little brother here I am inspired
with a new faith in mankind Ladies and gentlemen I wish to present
to you a sureenough saintonly wants a halo to be transfigured
To the LITTLE MAN Stand right up

 The LITTLE MAN stands up bewildered They come about him The
 OFFICIAL bows to him the POLICEMAN salutes him The DUTCH
 YOUTH shakes his head and laughs The GERMAN draws himself up
 very straight and bows quickly twice The ENGLISHMAN and his
 WIFE approach at least two steps then thinking better of it
 turn to each other and recede The MOTHER kisses his hand The
 PORTER returning with the Sanitatsmachine turns it on from
 behind and its pinkish shower goldened by a ray of sunlight
 falls around the LITTLE MANs head transfiguring it as he
 stands with eyes upraised to see whence the portent comes

AMERICAN Rushing forward and dropping on his knees Hold on just
a minute Guess Ill take a snapshot of the miracle He adjusts
his pocket camera This ought to look bully
