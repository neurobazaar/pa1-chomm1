WHAT DIANTHA DID

By Charlotte Perkins Gilman




CHAPTER I HANDICAPPED


 One may use the Old Man of the Sea
 For a partner or patron
 But helpless and hapless is he
 Who is ridden inextricably
 By a fond old mermatron


The Warden house was more impressive in appearance than its neighbors
It had grounds instead of a yard or garden it had wide pillared
porches and galleries showing southern antecedents moreover it
had a cupola giving date to the building and proof of the continuing
ambitions of the builders

The stately mansion was covered with heavy flowering vines also with
heavy mortgages Mrs Roscoe Warden and her four daughters reposed
peacefully under the vines while Roscoe Warden Jr struggled
desperately under the mortgages

A slender languid lady was Mrs Warden wearing her thin but still
brown hair in waterwaves over a pale high forehead She was sitting
on a couch on the broad roseshaded porch surrounded by billowing
masses of varicolored worsted It was her delight to purchase skein on
skein of soft brighthued wool cut it all up into short lengths tie
them together again in contrasting colors and then crochet this hashed
rainbow into afghans of startling aspect California does not call for
afghans to any great extent but they make such acceptable presents
Mrs Warden declared to those who questioned the purpose of her work
and she continued to send them off on Christmases birthdays and minor
weddings in a stream of pillowy bundles As they were accepted they
must have been acceptable and the stream flowed on

Around her among the gay blossoms and gayer wools sat her four
daughters variously intent The mother a poetic soul had named them
musically and with dulcet rhymes Madeline and Adeline were the two
eldest Coraline and Doraline the two youngest It had not occurred to
her until too late that those melodious terminations made it impossible
to call one daughter without calling two and that Lina called them
all

Mis Immerjin said a soft voice in the doorway dere postively
aint no butter in de house fer supper

No butter said Mrs Warden incredulously Why Sukey Im sure we
had a tub sent up lastlast Tuesday

A week ago Tuesday more likely mother suggested Dora

Nonsense Dora It was this week wasnt it girls The mother
appealed to them quite earnestly as if the date of that tubs delivery
would furnish forth the suppertable but none of the young ladies save
Dora had even a contradiction to offer

You know I never notice things said the artistic Cora and the
delines as their younger sisters called them said nothing

I might borrow some o Mis Bell suggested Sukey dats nearer n
de sto

Yes do Sukey her mistress agreed It is so hot But what have you
done with that tubful

Why some I tuk back to Mis Bell for what I borrered befoIm always
most careful to make return for what I borrersand yo know Mis
Warden dat waffles and sweet potaters and cohn bread dey do take
butter to say nothin o them little cakes you all likes so well_an_
de fried chicken _an_

Never mind Sukey you go and present my compliments to Mrs Bell and
ask her for some and be sure you return it promptly Now girls dont
let me forget to tell Ross to send up another tub

We cant seem to remember any better than you can mother said
Adeline dreamily Those details are so utterly uninteresting

I should think it was Sukeys business to tell him said Madeline with
decision while the alines kept silence this time

There Sukeys gone Mrs Warden suddenly remarked watching the stout
figure moving heavily away under the pepper trees And I meant to have
asked her to make me a glass of shrub Dora dear you run and get it
for mother

Dora laid down her work not too regretfully and started off

That child is the most practical of any of you said her mother which
statement was tacitly accepted It was not extravagant praise

Dora poked about in the refrigerator for a bit of ice She had no idea of
the high cost of ice in that regionit came from the store like all
their provisions It did not occur to her that fish and milk and melons
made a poor combination in flavor or that the clammy suboffensive
smell was not the natural and necessary odor of refrigerators Neither
did she think that a sunny corner of the back porch near the chimney
though convenient was an illselected spot for a refrigerator She
couldnt find the icepick so put a big piece of ice in a towel and
broke it on the edge of the sink replaced the largest fragment used
what she wanted and left the rest to filter slowly down through a mass
of grease and tealeaves found the raspberry vinegar and made a very
satisfactory beverage which her mother received with grateful affection

Thank you my darling she said I wish youd made a pitcherful

Why didnt you Do her sisters demanded

Youre too late said Dora hunting for her needle and then for her
thimble and then for her twist but theres more in the kitchen

Id rather go without than go into the kitchen said Adeline I do
despise a kitchen And this seemed to be the general sentiment for no
one moved

My mother always liked raspberry shrub said Mrs Warden and your
Aunt Leicester and your Raymond cousins

Mrs Warden had a wide family circle many beloved relatives
connections of whom she was duly proud and kin in such widening
ramifications that even her carefully reared daughters lost track of
them

You young people dont seem to care about your cousins at all pursued
their mother somewhat severely setting her glass on the railing from
whence it was presently knocked off and broken

Thats the fifth remarked Dora under breath

Why should we Ma inquired Cora Weve never seen one of
themexcept Madam Weatherstone

Well never forget _her_ said Madeline with delicate decision
laying down the silk necktie she was knitting for Roscoe What
_beautiful_ manners she had

How rich is she mother Do you know asked Dora

Rich enough to do something for Roscoe Im sure if she had a proper
family spirit replied Mrs Warden Her mother was own cousin to my
grandmotherone of the Virginia Paddingtons Or she might do something
for you girls

I wish she would Adeline murmured softly her large eyes turned to
the horizon her hands in her lap over the handkerchief she was marking
for Roscoe

Dont be ungrateful Adeline said her mother firmly You have a
good home and a good brother no girl ever had a better

But there is never anything going on broke in Coraline in a tone of
complaint no parties no going away for vacations no anything

Now Cora dont be discontented You must not add a straw to dear
Roscoes burdens said her mother

Of course not mother I wouldnt for the world I never saw her but
that once and she wasnt very cordial But as you say she might do
_something_ She might invite us to visit her

If she ever comes back again Im going to recite for her said Dora
firmly

Her mother gazed fondly on her youngest I wish you could dear
she agreed Im sure you have talent and Madam Weatherstone would
recognize it And Adelines music too And Coras art I am very proud
of my girls

Cora sat where the light fell well upon her work She was illuminating
a volume of poems painting flowers on the margins in appropriate
placesfor Roscoe

I wonder if hell care for it she said laying down her brush and
holding the book at arms length to get the effect

Of course he will answered her mother warmly It is not only the
beauty of it but the affection How are you getting on Dora

Dora was laboring at a task almost beyond her fourteen years consisting
of a negligee shirt of outing flannel upon the breast of which she was
embroidering a large intricate designfor Roscoe She was an ambitious
child but apt to tire in the execution of her large projects

I guess itll be done she said a little wearily What are you going
to give him mother

Another bathrobe his old one is so worn And nothing is too good for
my boy

Hes coming said Adeline who was still looking down the road and
they all concealed their birthday work in haste

A tall straight young fellow with an air of suddenlyfaced maturity
upon him opened the gate under the pepper trees and came toward them

He had the finely molded features we see in portraits of handsome
ancestors seeming to call for curling hair a little longish and a rich
profusion of ruffled shirt But his hair was sternly short his shirt
severely plain his proudly carried head spoke of effort rather than of
ease in its attitude

Dora skipped to meet him Cora descended a decorous step or two
Madeline and Adeline arm in arm met him at the piazza edge his mother
lifted her face

Well mother dear Affectionately he stooped and kissed her and she
held his hand and stroked it lovingly The sisters gathered about with
teasing affection Dora poking in his coatpocket for the stick candy
her father always used to bring her and her brother still remembered

Arent you home early dear asked Mrs Warden

Yes I had a little headachehe passed his hand over his
foreheadand Joe can run the store till after supper anyhow They
flew to get him camphor cologne a mentholpencil Dora dragged forth
the wicker lounge He was laid out carefully and fanned and fussed over
till his mother drove them all away

Now just rest she said Its an hour to supper time yet And she
covered him with her latest completed afghan gathering up and carrying
away the incomplete one and its tumultuous constituents

He was glad of the quiet the fresh sweet air the smell of flowers
instead of the smell of molasses and cheese soap and sulphur matches
But the headache did not stop nor the worry that caused it He loved
his mother he loved his sisters he loved their home but he did not
love the grocery business which had fallen so unexpectedly upon him at
his fathers death nor the load of debt which fell with it

That they need never have had so large a place to keep up did not
occur to him He had lived there most of his life and it was home That
the expenses of running the household were three times what they needed
to be he did not know His father had not questioned their style of
living nor did he That a family of five women might between them do
the work of the house he did not even consider

Mrs Wardens health was never good and since her husbands death she
had made daily use of many afghans on the many lounges of the house
Madeline was delicate and Adeline was frail Cora was nervous
Dora was only a child So black Sukey and her husband Jonah did the
work of the place so far as it was done and Mrs Warden held it a
miracle of management that she could do with one servant and the
height of womanly devotion on her daughters part that they dusted the
parlor and arranged the flowers

Roscoe shut his eyes and tried to rest but his problem beset him
ruthlessly There was the storetheir one and only source of income
There was the house a steady large expense There were five women to
clothe and keep contented beside himself There was the unappeasable
demand of the mortgageand there was Diantha

When Mr Warden died some four years previously Roscoe was a lad of
about twenty just home from college full of dreams of great service to
the world in science expecting to go back for his doctors degree next
year Instead of which the older man had suddenly dropped beneath
the burden he had carried with such visible happiness and pride such
unknown anxiety and straining effort and the younger one had to step
into the harness on the spot

He was brave capable wholly loyal to his mother and sisters reared
in the traditions of older days as to a mans duty toward women In his
first grief for his father and the ready pride with which he undertook
to fill his place he had not in the least estimated the weight of care
he was to carry nor the time that he must carry it A year a year or
two a few years he told himself as they passed and he would make
more money the girls of course would marry he could retire in time
and take up his scientific work again Thenthere was Diantha

When he found he loved this young neighbor of theirs and that she loved
him the first flush of happiness made all life look easier They had
been engaged six monthsand it was beginning to dawn upon the young man
that it might be six yearsor sixteen yearsbefore he could marry

He could not sell the businessand if he could he knew of no better
way to take care of his family The girls did not marry and even when
they did he had figured this out to a dreary certainty he would still
not be free To pay the mortgages off and keep up the house even
without his sisters would require all the money the store would bring
in for some six years ahead The young man set his teeth hard and turned
his head sharply toward the road

And there was Diantha

She stood at the gate and smiled at him He sprang to his feet
headacheless for the moment and joined her Mrs Warden from the
lounge by her bedroom window saw them move off together and sighed

Poor Roscoe she said to herself It is very hard for him But he
carries his difficulties nobly He is a son to be proud of And she
wept a little

Diantha slipped her hand in his offered armhe clasped it warmly with
his and they walked along together

You wont come in and see mother and the girls

No thank you not this time I must get home and get supper Besides
Id rather see just you

He felt it a pity that there were so many houses along the road here
but squeezed her hand anyhow

She looked at him keenly Headache she asked

Yes its nothing its gone already

Worry she asked

Yes I suppose it is he answered But I ought not to worry Ive
got a good home a good mother good sisters andyou And he took
advantage of a high hedge and an empty lot on either side of them

Diantha returned his kiss affectionately enough but seemed preoccupied
and walked in silence till he asked her what she was thinking about

About you of course she answered brightly There are things I want
to say and yetI ought not to

You can say anything on earth to me he answered

You are twentyfour she began musingly

Admitted at once

And Im twentyone and a half

Thats no such awful revelation surely

And weve been engaged ever since my birthday the girl pursued

All these are facts dearest

Now Ross will you be perfectly frank with me May I ask you anan
impertinent question

You may ask me any question you like it couldnt be impertinent

Youll be scandalised I knowbutwell here goes What would you
think if Madelineor any of the girlsshould go away to work

He looked at her lovingly but with a little smile on his firm mouth

I shouldnt allow it he said

Oallow it I asked you what youd think

I should think it was a disgrace to the family and a direct reproach
to me he answered But its no use talking about that None of the
girls have any such foolish notion And I wouldnt permit it if they
had

Diantha smiled I suppose you never would permit your wife to work

My widow might have tonot my wife He held his fine head a trifle
higher and her hand ached for a moment

Wouldnt you let me workto help you Ross

My dearest girl youve got something far harder than that to do for
me and thats wait

His face darkened again and he passed his hand over his forehead
Sometimes I feel as if I ought not to hold you at all he burst out
bitterly You ought to be free to marry a better man

There arent any said Diantha shaking her head slowly from side to
side And if there weremillionsI wouldnt marry any of em I love
_you_ she firmly concluded

Then well just _wait_ said he setting his teeth on the word as
if he would crush it It wont be hard with you to help Youre better
worth it than Rachael and Leah together They walked a few steps
silently

But how about science she asked him

I dont let myself think of it Ill take that up later Were young
enough both of us to wait for our happiness

And have you any ideawe might as well face the worsthow many years
do you think that will be dearest

He was a little annoyed at her persistence Also though he would not
admit the thought it did not seem quite the thing for her to ask A
woman should not seek too definite a period of waiting She ought to
trustto just wait on general principles

I can face a thing better if I know just what Im facing said the
girl quietly and Id wait for you if I had to all my life Will it
be twenty years do you think

He looked relieved Why no indeed darling It oughtnt to be at the
outside more than five Or six he added honest though reluctant

You see father had no time to settle anything there were outstanding
accounts and the funeral expenses and the mortgages But the business
is good and I can carry it I can build it up He shook his broad
shoulders determinedly I should think it might be within five
perhaps even less Good things happen sometimessuch as you my hearts
delight

They were at her gate now and she stood a little while to say
goodnight A step inside there was a seat walled in by evergreen
roofed over by the wide acacia boughs Many a long goodnight had they
exchanged there under the large brilliant California moon They sat
there silent now

Dianthas heart was full of love for him and pride and confidence in
him but it was full of other feelings too which he could not fathom
His trouble was clearer to her than to him as heavy to bear To her
mind trained in all the minutiae of domestic economy the Warden family
lived in careless wastefulness That five womenfor Dora was older than
she had been when she began to do houseworkshould require servants
seemed to this New Englandborn girl mere laziness and pride That two
voting women over twenty should prefer being supported by their brother
to supporting themselves she condemned even more sharply Moreover she
felt well assured that with a different family to support Mr Warden
would never have broken down so suddenly and irrecoverably Even that
funeralher face hardened as she thought of the conspicuous lot the
continual flowers the monument not wholly paid for yet that monument
though this she did not knowall that expenditure to do honor to the
man they had worked to death thus brutally Diantha put it was probably
enough to put off their happiness for a whole year

She rose at last her hand still held in his Im sorry but Ive got
to get supper dear she said and you must go Goodnight for the
present youll be round by and by

Yes for a little while after we close up said he and took himself
off not too suddenly walking straight and proud while her eyes were on
him throwing her a kiss from the corner but his step lagging and his
headache settling down upon him again as he neared the large house with
the cupola

Diantha watched him out of sight turned and marched up the path to her
own door her lips set tight her wellshaped head as straightly held
as his Its a shame a cruel burning shame she told herself
rebelliously A man of his ability Why he could do anything in his
own work And he loved it so

To keep a grocery store

And nothing to show for all that splendid effort

They dont do a thing They just _live_and keep house All those
women

Six years Likely to be sixty But Im not going to wait




CHAPTER II AN UNNATURAL DAUGHTER


 The brooding bird fulfills her task
 Or shebear lean and brown
 All parent beasts see duty true
 All parent beasts their duty do
 We are the only kind that asks
 For duty upside down


The stiffrayed windmill stood like a tall mechanical flower turning
slowly in the light afternoon wind its faint regular metallic squeak
pricked the dry silence wearingly Rampant fuchsias redjewelled
heavy ran up its framework with crowding heliotrope and nasturtiums
Thick straggling roses hung over the kitchen windows and a row of dusty
eucalyptus trees rustled their stiff leaves and gave an ineffectual
shade to the house

It was one of those small frame houses common to the northeastern
states which must be dear to the hearts of their dwellers For no
other reason surely would the cold grey steeproofed little boxes be
repeated so faithfully in the broad glow of a semitropical landscape
There was an attempt at a lawn the pet ambition of the transplanted
easterner and a further attempt at flowerbeds which merely served
as a sort of springboard to their farreaching products

The parlor behind the closed blinds was as New England parlors are
minus the hint of cosiness given by even a fireless stove the little
bedrooms baked under the roof only the kitchen spoke of human living
and the living it portrayed was not to say the least joyous It was
clean clean with a cleanness that spoke of conscientious labor and
unremitting care The zinc mat under the big cookstove was scoured to a
dull glimmer while that swart altar itself shone darkly from its daily
rubbing

There was no dust nor smell of dust no grease spots no litter
anywhere But the place bore no atmosphere of contented pride as does
a Dutch German or French kitchen it spoke of Labor Economy and
Dutyunder restriction

In the dead quiet of the afternoon Diantha and her mother sat there
sewing The sun poured down through the dangling eucalyptus leaves The
dry air rich with flower odors flowed softly in pushing the white
sash curtains a steady inch or two EeerrrEeerrrcame the faint
whine of the windmill

To the older woman rocking in her small splint chair by the rosedraped
window her thoughts dwelling on long dark green grass the shade of
elms and cows kneedeep in rivershallows this was Californiahot
arid tedious in endless sunlighta place of exile

To the younger the long seam of the turned sheet pinned tightly to her
knee her needle flying firmly and steadily and her thoughts full of
pouring moonlight through acacia boughs and Rosss murmured words it
was Californiarich warm full of sweet bloom and fruit of boundless
vitality promise and powerhome

Mrs Bell drew a long weary sigh and laid down her work for a moment

Why dont you stop it Mother dear Theres surely no hurry about these
things

Nonot particularly her mother answered but theres plenty else to
do And she went on with the long neat hemming Diantha did the over
and over seam up the middle

What _do_ you do it for anyway MotherI always hated this joband
you dont seem to like it

They wear almost twice as long child you know The middle gets worn
and the edges dont Now theyre reversed As to liking it She gave
a little smile a smile that was too tired to be sarcastic but which
certainly did not indicate pleasure

What kind of work do you like bestreally her daughter inquired
suddenly after a silent moment or two

WhyI dont know said her mother I never thought of it I never
tried any but teaching I didnt like that Neither did your Aunt
Esther but shes still teaching

Didnt you like any of it pursued Diantha

I liked arithmetic best I always loved arithmetic when I went to
schoolused to stand highest in that

And what part of housework do you like best the girl persisted

Mrs Bell smiled again wanly Seems to me sometimes as if I couldnt
tell sometimes what part I like least she answered Then with sudden
heatO my Child Dont you marry till Ross can afford at least one
girl for you

Diantha put her small strong hands behind her head and leaned back in
her chair Well have to wait some time for that I fancy she said
But Mother there is one part you likekeeping accounts I never saw
anything like the way you manage the money and I believe youve got
every bill since you were married

YesI do love accounts Mrs Bell admitted And I can keep run of
things Ive often thought your Fatherd have done better if hed let me
run that end of his business

Diantha gave a fierce little laugh She admired her father in some ways
enjoyed him in some ways loved him as a child does if not illtreated
but she loved her mother with a sort of passionate pity mixed with
pride feeling always nobler power in her than had ever had a fair
chance to grow It seemed to her an interminable dull tragedy this
graceful eager blackeyed woman spending what to the girl was
literally a lifetime in the conscientious performance of duties she did
not love

She knew her mothers idea of duty knew the clear head the steady
will the active intelligence holding her relentlessly to the task the
chafe and fret of seeing her husband constantly attempting against her
judgment and failing for lack of the help he scorned Young as she was
she realized that the nervous breakdown of these later years was wholly
due to that common misery of the square man in the round hole

She folded her finished sheet in accurate lines and laid it awaytaking
her mothers also Now you sit still for once Mother dear read or lie
down Dont you stir till suppers ready

And from pantry to table she stepped swiftly and lightly setting out
what was needed greased her pans and set them before her and proceeded
to make biscuit

Her mother watched her admiringly How easy you do it she said I
never could make bread without getting flour all over me You dont
spill a speck

Diantha smiled I ought to do it easily by this time Fathers got to
have hot bread for supperor thinks he hasand Ive made emevery
night when I was at home for this ten years back

I guess you have said Mrs Bell proudly You were only eleven when
you made your first batch I can remember just as well I had one of my
bad headaches that nightand it did seem as if I couldnt sit up But
your Fathers got to have his biscuit whether or no And you said Now
Mother you lie right still on that sofa and let me do it I can And
you couldyou did They were bettern mine that first timeand your
Father praised emand youve been at it ever since

Yes said Diantha with a deeper note of feeling than her mother
caught Ive been at it ever since

Except when you were teaching school pursued her mother

Except when I taught school at Medville Diantha corrected When I
taught here I made em just the same

So you did agreed her mother So you did No matter how tired you
wereyou wouldnt admit it You always were the best child

If I was tired it was not of making biscuits anyhow I was tired enough
of teaching school though Ive got something to tell you presently
Mother

She covered the biscuits with a light cloth and set them on the shelf
over the stove then poked among the greasewood roots to find what
she wanted and started a fire Why _dont_ you get an oil stove Or a
gasoline It would be a lot easier

Yes her mother agreed Ive wanted one for twenty years but you
know your Father wont have one in the house He says theyre dangerous
What are you going to tell me dear I do hope you and Ross havent
quarrelled

No indeed we havent Mother Ross is splendid Only

Only what Dinah

Only hes so tied up said the girl brushing every chip from the
hearth Hes perfectly helpless there with that mother of hisand
those four sisters

Ross is a good son said Mrs Bell and a good brother I never saw a
better Hes certainly doing his duty Now if his fatherd lived you two
could have got married by this time maybe though youre too young yet

Diantha washed and put away the dishes she had used saw that the pantry
was in its usual delicate order and proceeded to set the table with
light steps and no clatter of dishes

Im twentyone she said

Yes youre twentyone her mother allowed It dont seem possible
but you are My first baby she looked at her proudly

If Ross has to wait for all those girls to marryand to pay his
fathers debtsIll be old enough said Diantha grimly

Her mother watched her quick assured movements with admiration and
listened with keen sympathy I know its hard dear child Youve
only been engaged six monthsand it looks as if it might be some years
before Rossll be able to marry Hes got an awful load for a boy to
carry alone

I should say he had Diantha burst forth Five helpless womenor
three women and two girls Though Coras as old as I was when I began
to teach And not one of em will lift a finger to earn her own living

They werent brought up that way said Mrs Bell Their mother dont
approve of it She thinks the home is the place for a womanand so does
Rossand so do I she added rather faintly

Diantha put her pan of white puffballs into the oven sliced a quantity
of smoked beef in thin shavings and made white sauce for it talking
the while as if these acts were automatic I dont agree with Mrs
Warden on that point nor with Ross nor with you Mother she said
What Ive got to tell you is thisIm going away from home To work

Mrs Bell stopped rocking stopped fanning and regarded her daughter
with wide frightened eyes

Why Diantha she said Why Diantha You wouldnt go and leave your
Mother

Diantha drew a deep breath and stood for a moment looking at the feeble
little woman in the chair Then she went to her knelt down and hugged
her closeclose

Its not because I dont love you Mother Its because I do And its
not because I dont love Ross eitherits because I _do_ I want to
take care of you Mother and make life easier for you as long as
you live I want to help himto help carry that awful loadand Im
goingtodoit

She stood up hastily for a step sounded on the back porch It was only
her sister who hurried in put a dish on the table kissed her mother
and took another rockingchair

I just ran in said she to bring those berries Arent they
beauties The babys asleep Gerald hasnt got in yet Suppers all
ready and I can see him coming time enough to run back Why Mother
Whats the matter Youre crying

Am I asked Mrs Bell weakly wiping her eyes in a dazed way

What are you doing to Mother Diantha demanded young Mrs Peters
Bless me I thought you and she never had any differences I was always
the black sheep when I was at home Maybe thats why I left so early

She looked very pretty and complacent this young matron and mother of
nineteen and patted the older womans hand affectionately demanding
Comewhats the trouble

You might as well know now as later said her sister I have decided
to leave home thats all

To leave home Mrs Peters sat up straight and stared at her To
leave homeAnd Mother

Well said Diantha while the tears rose and ran over from her
mothers eyes Well why not You left homeand Motherbefore you
were eighteen

Thats different said her sister sharply I left to be marriedto
have a home of my own And besides I havent gone far I can see Mother
every day

Thats one reason I can go now better than later on Diantha said
You are close by in case of any trouble

What on earth are you going for Ross isnt ready to marry yet is he

Nonor likely to be for years Thats another reason Im going

But what _for_ for goodness sake

To earn moneyfor one thing

Cant you earn money enough by teaching the Mother broke in eagerly
I know you havent got the same place this fallbut you can get
another easy enough

Diantha shook her head No Mother Ive had enough of that Ive
taught for four years I dont like it I dont do well and it exhausts
me horribly And I should never get beyond a thousand or fifteen hundred
dollars a year if I taught for a lifetime

Well I declare said her sister What do you _expect_ to get I
should think fifteen hundred dollars a year was enough for any woman

Diantha peered into the oven and turned her biscuit pan around

And youre meaning to leave home just to make money are you

Why not said Diantha firmly Henderson didwhen he was eighteen
None of you blamed him

I dont see what thats got to do with it her mother ventured
Hendersons a boy and boys have to go of course A mother expects
that But a girlWhy Diantha How can I get along without you With my
health

I should think youd be ashamed of yourself to think of such a thing
said young Mrs Peters

A slow step sounded outside and an elderly man tall slouching
carelessly dressed entered stumbling a little over the ragmat at the
door

Father hasnt got used to that rug in fourteen years said his
youngest daughter laughingly And Mother will straighten it out after
him Im bringing Gerald up on better principles You should just see
him wait on me

A man should be master in his own household Mr Bell proclaimed
raising a dripping face from the basin and looking around for the
towelwhich his wife handed him

You wont have much household to be master of presently said Mrs
Peters provokingly Half of its going to leave

Mr Bell came out of his towel and looked from one to the other for some
explanation of this attempted joke What nonsense are you talking he
demanded

I think its nonsense myself said the pretty young womanher hand on
the doorknob But youd better enjoy those biscuits of Dis while you
canyou wont get many more Theres Geraldgood night And off she
ran

Diantha set the plateful on the table puffy brown and crisply
crusted Suppers ready she said Do sit down Mother and she held
the chair for her Minnies quite right Father though I meant not to
tell you till youd had supper I am going away to work

Mr Bell regarded his daughter with a stern slow stare not so much
surprised as annoyed by an untimely jesting He ate a hot biscuit in two
unFletcherized mouthfuls and put more sugar in his large cup of tea
Youve got your Mother all worked up with your nonsense said he
What are you talking about anyway

Diantha met his eyes unflinchingly He was a tall old man still
handsome and impressive in appearance had been the head of his own
household beyond question ever since he was left the only son of
an idolizing mother But he had never succeeded in being the head
of anything else Repeated failures in the old New England home had
resulted in his ruthlessly selling all the property there and bringing
his delicate wife and three young children to California Vain were her
protests and objections It would do her goodbest place in the world
for childrengood for nervous complaints too A wifes duty was to
follow her husband of course She had followed willy nilly and it was
good for the childrenthere was no doubt of that

Mr Bell had profited little by his venture They had the ranch the
flowers and fruit and ample living of that rich soil but he had failed
in oranges failed in raisins failed in prunes and was now failing in
wealthpromising hens

But Mrs Bell though an ineffectual housekeeper did not fail in
the children They had grown up big and vigorous sturdy handsome
creatures especially the two younger ones Diantha was goodlooking
enough Roscoe Warden thought her divinely beautiful But her young
strength had been heavily taxed from childhood in that complex process
known as helping mother As a little child she had been of constant
service in caring for the babies and early developed such competence in
the various arts of house work as filled her mother with fond pride and
even wrung from her father some grudging recognition That he did not
value it more was because he expected such competence in women all
women it was their natural field of ability their duty as wives and
mothers Also as daughters If they failed in it that was by illness or
perversity If they succeededthat was a matter of course

He ate another of Dianthas excellent biscuits his greyishred whiskers
slowly wagging and continued to eye her disapprovingly She said
nothing but tried to eat and tried still harder to make her heart go
quietly her cheeks keep cool and her eyes dry Mrs Bell also strove
to keep a cheerful countenance urged food upon her family even tried
to open some topic of conversation but her gentle words trailed off
into unnoticed silence

Mr Bell ate until he was satisfied and betook himself to a comfortable
chair by the lamp where he unfolded the smart local paper and lit
his pipe When youve got through with the dishes Diantha he said
coldly Ill hear about this proposition of yours

Diantha cleared the table lowered the leaves set it back against
the wall spreading the turkeyred cloth upon it She washed the
dishesher kettle long since boiling scalded them wiped them set
them in their places washed out the towels wiped the pan and hung it
up swiftly accurately and with a quietness that would have seemed
incredible to any mistress of heavyfooted servants Then with
heightened color and firmset mouth she took her place by the lamplit
table and sat still

Her mother was patiently darning large socks with many holesa kind
of work she specially disliked Youll have to get some new socks
Father she ventured these are pretty well gone

O theyll do a good while yet he replied not looking at them I
like your embroidery my dear

That pleased her She did not like to embroider but she did like to be
praised

Diantha took some socks and set to work redchecked and excited but
silent yet Her mothers needle trembled irregularly under and over and
a tear or two slid down her cheeks

Finally Mr Bell laid down his finished paper and his emptied pipe and
said Now then Out with it

This was not a felicitious opening It is really astonishing how little
diplomacy parents exhibit how difficult they make it for the young to
introduce a proposition There was nothing for it but a bald statement
so Diantha made it baldly

I have decided to leave home and go to work she said

Dont you have work enough to do at home he inquired with the same
air of quizzical superiority which had always annoyed her so intensely
even as a little child

She would cut short this form of discussion I am going away to earn
my living I have given up schoolteachingI dont like it and there
isnt money enough in it I have planswhich will speak for themselves
later

So said Mr Bell Plans all made eh I suppose youve considered
your Mother in these plans

I have said his daughter It is largely on her account that Im
going

You think itll be good for your Mothers health to lose your
assistance do you

I know shell miss me but I havent left the work on her shoulders I
am going to pay for a girlto do the work Ive done It wont cost you
any more Father and youll save somefor shell do the washing too
You didnt object to Hendersons goingat eighteen You didnt object
to Minnies goingat seventeen Why should you object to my goingat
twentyone

I havent objectedso far replied her father Have your plans also
allowed for the affection and duty you owe your parents

I have done my dutyas well as I know how she answered Now I am
twentyone and selfsupportingand have a right to go

O yes You have a righta legal rightif thats what you base your
idea of a childs duty on And while youre talking of rightshow about
a parents rights How about common gratitude How about what you owe
to mefor all the care and pains and cost its been to bring you up A
childs a rather expensive investment these days

Diantha flushed she had expected this and yet it struck her like a
blow It was not the first time she had heard itthis claim of filial
obligation

I have considered that position Father I know you feel that
wayyouve often made me feel it So Ive been at some pains to work it
outon a money basis Here is an accountas full as I could make it
She handed him a paper covered with neat figures The totals read as
follows

 Miss Diantha Bell
 To Mr Henderson R Bell Dr

 To medical and dental expenses 11000
 To school expenses 7600
 To clothing in full 113000
 To board and lodging at 300 a week 218400
 To incidentals 10000
  360000

He studied the various items carefully stroking his beard half in
anger half in unavoidable amusement Perhaps there was a tender feeling
too as he remembered that doctors billthe first he ever paid with
the other when she had scarlet fever and saw the exact price of the
high chair which had served all three of the children but of which she
magnanimously shouldered the whole expense

The clothing total was so large that it made him whistlehe knew he had
never spent 113000 on one girls clothes But the items explained it

 Materials three years at an average of 10 a year 3000
 Five years averaging 20 each year 10000
 Five years averaging 30 each year 5000
 Five years averaging 50 each year 25000
  53000

The rest was Mothers labor averaging twenty full days a year at 2
a day 40 a year For fifteen years 60000 Mothers laboron one
childs clothesfooting up to 60000 It looked strange to see cash
value attached to that unfailing source of family comfort and advantage

The school expenses puzzled him a bit for she had only gone to public
schools but she was counting books and slates and even pencilsit
brought up evenings long passed by the sewing wife the studying
children the Say Father Ive got to have a new slatemines broke

Broken Dina her Mother would gently correct while he demanded
How did you break it and scolded her for her careless tomboy ways
Slatesthree 150they were all down And slates didnt cost so much
come to think of it even the rededged ones wound with black that she
always wanted

Board and lodging was put low at 300 per week but the items had a
footnote as to houserent in the country and food raised on the farm
Yes he guessed that was a full rate for the plain food and bare little
bedroom they always had

Its what Aunt Esther paid the winter she was here said Diantha

 Circusesthree 150
 Share in melodeon 5000

Yes she was one of five to use and enjoy it

 Music lessons 3000

And quite a large margin left here called miscellaneous which he
smiled to observe made just an even figure and suspected she had put in
for that purpose as well as from generosity

This board account looks kind of funny he saidonly fourteen years
of it

I didnt take tableboardnor a roomthe first yearnor much
the second Ive allowed 100 a week for that and 200 for the
thirdthat takes out two you see Then its 156 a year till I was
fourteen and earned board and wages two more years at 156and Ive
paid since I was seventeen you know

WellI guess you didI guess you did He grinned genially Yes
he continued slowly I guess thats a fair enough account Cording
to this you owe me 360000 young woman I didnt think it cost that
much to raise a girl

I know it said she But heres the other side

It was the other side He had never once thought of such a side to the
case This account was as clear and honest as the first and full of
exasperating detail She laid before him the second sheet of figures and
watched while he read explaining hurriedly

It was a clear expense for ten yearsnot counting help with the
babies Then I began to do housework regularlywhen I was ten or
eleven two hours a day three when I was twelve and thirteenreal work
youd have had to pay for and Ive only put it at ten cents an hour
When Mother was sick the year I was fourteen and I did it all but the
washingall a servant would have done for 300 a week Ever since then
I have done three hours a day outside of school full grown work now at
twenty cents an hour Thats what we have to pay here you know

Thus it mounted up

 Mr Henderson R Bell
 To Miss Diantha Bell Dr

 For labor and services

 Two years two hours a day at 10c an hour 14600
 Two years three hours a day at 10c an hour 21900
 One year full wages at 500 a week 26000
 Six years and a half three hours a day at 20c 142350
  204850

Mr Bell meditated carefully on these figures To think of that childs
labor footing up to two thousand dollars and over It was lucky a man
had a wife and daughters to do this work or he could never support a
family

Then came her schoolteaching years She had always been a fine scholar
and he had felt very proud of his girl when she got a good school
position in her eighteenth year

California salaries were higher than eastern ones and times had
changed too the year he taught school he remembered the salary was only
30000and he was a man This girl got 600 next year 700 800
900 why it made 3000 she had earned in four years Astonishing Out
of this she had a balance in the bank of 55000 He was pleased to see
that she had been so saving And her clothing accountlittle enough he
admitted for four years and six months 30000 All incidentals for
the whole time 5000this with her balance made just 900 That left
210000

Twentyone hundred dollars unaccounted for young ladybesides this
nest egg in the bankId no idea you were so wealthy What have you
done with all that

Given it to you Father said she quietly and handed him the third
sheet of figures

Board and lodging at 400 a week for 4 12 years made 93600 that he
could realize but cash advance 1164 morehe could not believe it
That time her mother was so sick and Diantha had paid both the doctor
and the nurseyeshe had been much cramped that yearand nurses come
high For Henderson Jrs expenses to San Francisco and again for
Henderson when he was out of a jobMr Bell remembered the boys
writing for the money and his not having it and Mrs Bell saying she
could arrange with Diantha

Arrange And that girl had kept this niggardly account of it For
Minnies trip to the Yosemiteand what was thisfor his raisin
experimentfor the new horse they simply had to have for the drying
apparatus that year he lost so much money in apricotsand for the
spraying materialsyes he could not deny the items and they covered
that 116400 exactly

Then came the deadly balance of the account between them

 Her labor 204700
 Her board 93600
 Her cash advanced 116400
  414700
 His expense for her 3600
  Due her from him 54700

Diantha revolved her pencil between firm palms and looked at him
rather quizzically while her mother rocked and darned and wiped away an
occasional tear She almost wished she had not kept accounts so well

Mr Bell pushed the papers away and started to his feet

This is the most shameful piece of calculation I ever saw in my life
said he I never heard of such a thing You go and count up in cold
dollars the work that every decent girl does for her family and is glad
to I wonder you havent charged your mother for nursing her

You notice I havent said Diantha coldly

And to think said he gripping the back of a chair and looking down
at her fiercely to think that a girl who can earn nine hundred dollars
a year teaching school and stay at home and do her duty by her family
besides should plan to desert her mother outrightnow shes old and
sick Of course I cant stop you Youre of age and children nowadays
have no sense of natural obligation after theyre grown up You can
go of course and disgrace the family as you proposebut you neednt
expect to have me consent to it or approve of itor of you Its a
shameful thingand you are an unnatural daughterthats all Ive got
to say

Mr Bell took his hat and went outa conclusive form of punctuation
much used by men in discussions of this sort




CHAPTER III BREAKERS


 Duck Dive Here comes another one
 Wait till the crestruffles show
 Beyond is smooth water in beauty and wonder
 Shut your mouth Hold your breath Dip your head under
 Dive through the weight and the wash and the thunder
 Look out for the undertow


If Diantha imagined that her arithmetical victory over a toosordid
presentation of the parental claim was a final one she soon found
herself mistaken

It is easy to sayputting an epic in an epigramShe seen her duty and
she done it but the space and time covered are generally as far beyond
our plans as the estimates of an amateur mountain climber exceed his
achievements

Her determination was not concealed by her outraged family Possibly
they thought that if the matter was well aired and generally discussed
the daring offender might reconsider Wellaired it certainly was and
widely discussed by the parents of the little town before young people
who sat in dumbness or made faint defense It was also discussed by the
young people but not before their parents

She had told Ross first of all meaning to have a quiet talk with him
to clear the ground before arousing her own family but he was suddenly
away just as she opened the subject by a man on a wheelsome wretched
business about the store of courseand sent word that night that he
could not come up again Couldnt come up the next night either Two
long daystwo long evenings without seeing him Wellif she went away
shed have to get used to that

But she had so many things to explain so much to say to make it
right with him she knew well what a blow it was Now it was all over
townand she had had no chance to defend her position

The neighbors called Tall bony Mrs Delafield who lived nearest to them
and had known Diantha for some years felt it her duty to make a special
appealor attack rather and brought with her stout Mrs Schlosster
whose ancestors and traditions were evidently of German extraction

Diantha retired to her room when she saw these two bearing down upon
the house but her mother called her to make a pitcher of lemonade for
themand having entered there was no escape They harried her with
questions were increasingly offended by her reticence and expressed
disapproval with a fullness that overmastered the girls selfcontrol

I have as much right to go into business as any other citizen Mrs
Delafield she said with repressed intensity I am of age and live in
a free country What you say of children no longer applies to me

And what is this mysterious business youre goin intoif one
may inquire Nothin youre ashamed to mention I hope asked Mrs
Delafield

If a woman refuses to mention her age is it because shes ashamed of
it the girl retorted and Mrs Delafield flushed darkly

Never have I heard such talk from a maiden to her elders said Mrs
Schlosster In my country the young have more respect as is right

Mrs Bell objected inwardly to any reprimand of her child by others but
she agreed to the principle advanced and made no comment

Diantha listened to quite a volume of detailed criticism inquiry and
condemnation and finally rose to her feet with the stiff courtesy of
the young

You must excuse me now she said with set lips I have some necessary
work to do

She marched upstairs shut her bedroom door and locked it raging
inwardly Its none of their business Not a shadow Why should Mother
sit there and let them talk to me like that One would think childhood
had no limitunless its matrimony

This reminded her of her younger sisters airs of superior wisdom and
did not conduce to a pleasanter frame of mind With all their miserable
little conventions and idiocies And what theyll say and theyll
think As if I cared Minniell be just such another

She heard the ladies going out still talking continuously a faint
response from her mother now and then a growing quiet as their steps
receded toward the gate and then another deeper voice took up the theme
and heavily approached

It was the minister Diantha dropped into her rocker and held the arms
tight Now Ill have to take it again I suppose But he ought to know
me well enough to understand

Diantha called her mother Heres Dr Major and the girl washed
her face and came down again

Dr Major was a heavy elderly man with a strong mouth and a warm hand
clasp Whats all this I hear about you young lady he demanded
holding her hand and looking her straight in the eye Is this a new
kind of Prodigal Daughter were encountering

He did not look nor sound condemnatory and as she faced him she caught
a twinkle in the wise old eyes

You can call it that if you want to she said Only I thought the
Prodigal Son just spent his moneyIm going to earn some

I want you to talk to Diantha Doctor Major Mrs Bell struck in Im
going to ask you to excuse me and go and lie down for a little I do
believe shell listen to you more than to anybody

The mother retired feeling sure that the good man who had known her
daughter for over fifteen years would have a restraining influence now
and Diantha braced herself for the attack

It came heavy and solid based on reason religion tradition the
custom of ages the pastoral habit of control and protection the
fathers instinct the mans objection to a girls adventure But it was
courteous kind and rationally put and she met it point by point with
the wholesouled arguments of a new position the passionate enthusiasm
of her years

They called a truce

I can see that you _think_ its your duty young womanthats the main
thing I think youre wrong But what you believe to be right you
have to do Thats the way we learn my dear thats the way we learn
Wellyouve been a good child ever since Ive known you A remarkably
good child If you have to sow this kind of wild oats they both
smiled at this I guess we cant stop you Ill keep your secret

Its not a secret really the girl explained Ill tell them as soon
as Im settled Then they can tellif they want to And they both
smiled again

WellI wont tell till I hear of it then Andyes I guess I can
furnish that document with a clean conscience

She gave him paper and pen and he wrote with a grin handing her the
result

She read it a girlish giggle lightening the atmosphere Thank you
she said earnestly Thank you ever so much I knew you would help me

If you get stuck anywhere just let me know he said rising This
Proddy Gal may want a return ticket yet

Ill walk first said Diantha

O Dr Major cried her mother from the window Dont go We want you
to stay to supper of course

But he had other calls to make he said and went away his big hands
clasped behind him his head bent smiling one minute and shaking his
head the next

Diantha leaned against a pearly eucalyptus trunk and watched him She
would miss Dr Major But who was this approaching Her heart sank
miserably Mrs Wardenand _all_ the girls

She went to meet themperforce Mrs Warden had always been kind and
courteous to her the girls she had not seen very much of but they had
the sweet Southern manner were always polite Rosss mother she must
love Rosss sisters tooif she could Why did the bottom drop out of
her courage at sight of them

You dear child said Mrs Warden kissing her I know just how you
feel You want to help my boy Thats your secret But this wont do it
my dear

Youve no idea how badly Ross feels said Madeline Mrs Delafield
dropped in just now and told us You ought to have seen him

He didnt believe it of course Adeline put in And he wouldnt say a
thingnot a thing to blame you

We said wed come over right offand tried to bring himbut he said
hed got to go back to the store Coraline explained

He was mad though said Dora_I_ know

Diantha looked from one to the other helplessly

Come in Come in said Mrs Bell hospitably Have this rocker Mrs
Wardenwouldnt you like some cool drink Diantha

No indeed Mrs Warden protested Dont get a thing Were going
right back its near supper time No we cant think of staying of
course not no indeedBut we had to come over and hear about this dear
childs ideaNow tell us all about it Diantha

There they satfive pairs of curious eyesand her mothers sad
onesall kindall utterly incapable of understanding

She moistened her lips and plunged desperately It is nothing dreadful
Mrs Warden Plenty of girls go away to earn their livings nowadays
That is all Im doing

But why go away

I thought you were earning your living before

Isnt teaching earning your living

What _are_ you going to do the girls protested variously and Mrs
Warden with a motherly smile suggested

That doesnt explain your wanting to leave Ross my dearand your
mother

I dont want to leave them protested Diantha trying to keep her
voice steady It is simply that I have made up my mind I can do better
elsewhere

Do what better asked Mrs Warden with sweet patience which reduced
Diantha to the bald statement Earn more money in less time

And is that better than staying with your mother and your lover
pursued the gentle inquisitor while the girls tried What do you want
to earn more money for and I thought you earned a lot before

Now Diantha did not wish to state in so many words that she wanted more
money in order to marry soonershe had hardly put it to herself that
way She could not make them see in a few moments that her plan was to
do far more for her mother than she would otherwise ever be able to And
as to making them understand the larger principles at stakethe range
and depth of her full purposethat would be physically impossible

I am sorry she said with trembling lips I am extremely sorry
ButI cannot explain

Mrs Warden drew herself up a little Cannot explain to meYour
mother of course knows

Diantha is naturally more frank with me than withanyone said Mrs
Bell proudly But she does not wish herbusinessplansmade public
at present

Her daughter looked at her with vivid gratitude but the words made
public were a little unfortunate perhaps

Of course Mrs Warden agreed with her charming smile that we can
quite understand Im sure I should always wish my girls to feel so
Madelinejust show Mrs Bell that necktie youre makingshe was asking
about the stitch you remember

The necktie was produced and admired while the other girls asked
Diantha if she had her fall dressmaking done yetand whether she
found wash ribbon satisfactory And presently the whole graceful family
withdrew only Dora holding her head with visible stiffness

Diantha sat on the floor by her mother put her head in her lap and
cried How splendid of you Mother she sobbed How simply splendid
I will tell you nowififyou wont tell even Fatheryet

Dear child said her Mother Id rather not know in that case It
iseasier

Thats what I kept still for said the girl Its hard enough
goodness knowsas it is Its nothing wicked or even risky Mother
dearand as far as I can see it is right

Her mother smiled through her tears If you say that my dear child
I know theres no stopping you And I hate to argue with youeven for
your own sake because it is so much to my advantage to have you here
Ishall miss youDiantha

Dont Mother sobbed the girl

Its natural for the young to go We expect itin time But you are so
young yetandwell I had hoped the teaching would satisfy you till
Ross was ready

Diantha sat up straight

Mother cant you see Rossll never be ready Look at that family And
the way they live And those mortgages I could wait and teach and save
a little even with Father always losing money but I cant see Ross
wearing himself out for years and yearsI just _cant_ bear it

Her mother stroked her fair hair softly not surprised that her own plea
was so lost in thought of the brave young lover

And besides the girl went on If I waitedand savedand married
Rosswhat becomes of _you_ Id like to know What I cant stand is to
have you grow older and sickerand never have any good time in all your
life

Mrs Bell smiled tenderly You dear child she said as if an
affectionate fiveyear old had offered to get her a rainbow I know
you mean it all for the best But O my _dearest_ Id rather have
youhereat home with methan any other good time you can
imagine

She could not see the suffering in her daughters face but she felt
she had made an impression and followed it up with heartbreaking
sincerity She caught the girl to her breast and held her like a little
child O my baby my baby Dont leave your mother I cant bear it

A familiar step outside heavy yet uncertain and they both looked at
each other with frightened eyes

They had forgotten the biscuit


Supper ready asked Mr Bell with grim humor

It will be in a moment Father cried Diantha springing to her feet
At leastin a few moments

Dont fret the child Father said Mrs Henderson softly Shes
feeling bad enough

Shd think she would replied her husband Moreoverto my mindshe
ought to

He got out the small damp local paper and his pipe and composed himself
in obvious patience yet somehow this patience seemed to fill the
kitchen and to act like a ball and chain to Dianthas feet

She got supper ready at last making griddlecakes instead of biscuit
and no comment was made of the change but the tension in the atmosphere
was sharply felt by the two women and possibly by the tall old man who
ate less than usual and said absolutely nothing

Im going over to see Edwards about that new incubator he said when
the meal was over and departed and Mrs Bell after trying in vain to
do her mending wiped her clouded glasses and went to bed

Diantha made all neat and tidy washed her own wet eyes again and went
out under the moon In that broad tender mellow light she drew a deep
breath and stretched her strong young arms toward the sky in dumb
appeal

I knew it would be hard she murmured to herself That is I knew the
factsbut I didnt know the feeling

She stood at the gate between the cypresses sat waiting under the
acacia boughs walked restlessly up and down the path outside the dry
pepper berries crush softly under foot bracing herself for one more
struggleand the hardest of all

He will understand he told herself over and over but at the bottom
of her heart she knew he wouldnt

He came at last a slower wearier step than usual came and took both
her hands in his and stood holding them looking at her questioningly
Then he held her face between his palms and made her look at him Her
eyes were brave and steady but the mouth trembled in spite of her

He stilled it with a kiss and drew her to a seat on the bench beside
him My poor Little Girl You havent had a chance yet to really tell
me about this thing and I want you to right now Then Im going to kill
about forty people in this town _Somebody_ has been mighty foolish

She squeezed his hand but found it very difficult to speak His
love his sympathy his tenderness were so delicious after this days
trialsand before those further ones she could so well anticipate
She didnt wish to cry any more that would by no means strengthen her
position and she found she couldnt seem to speak without crying

One would think to hear the good people of this town that you were
about to leave home and mother forwell for a trip to the moon he
added There isnt any agreement as to what youre going to do but
theyre unanimous as to its being entirely wrong Now suppose you tell
me about it

I will said Diantha I began to the other night you know you first
of courseit was too bad your having to go off at that exact moment
Then I had to tell motherbecausewell youll see presently Now
dearjust let me say it _all_before youdo anything

Say away my darling I trust you perfectly

She flashed a grateful look at him It is this way my dear I have
two three yes four things to considerMy own personal problemmy
familysyoursand a social one

My familys he asked with a faint shade of offence in his tone

No no dearyour own she explained

Better cut mine out Little Girl he said Ill consider that
myself

WellI wont talk about it if you dont want me to There are the
other three

I wont question your second nor your imposing third but isnt
the first oneyour own personal problema good deal answered he
suggested holding her close for a moment

Dont she said I cant talk straight when you put it that way

She rose hurriedly and took a step or two up and down I dont
supposein spite of your loving me that I can make you see it as I
do But Ill be just as clear as I can There are some years before
us before we can be together In that time I intend to go away and
undertake a business I am interested in My purpose is todevelop the
work to earn money to help my family and towell not to hinder
you

I dont understand I confess he said Dont you propose to tell me
what this work is

YesI willcertainly But not yet dear Let me try to show you how I
feel about it

Wait said he One thing I want to be sure of Are you doing this
with any quixotic notion of helping mein _my_ business Helping me to
take care of my family Helping me to he stood up now looking very
tall and rather forbidding No I wont say that to you

Would there be anything wrong in my meaning exactly that she asked
holding her own head a little higher both what you said and what you
didnt

It would be absolutely wrong all of it he answered I cannot
believe that the woman I love wouldcould take such a position

Look here Ross said the girl earnestly Suppose you knew where
there was a gold mine_knew it_and by going away for a few years you
could get a real fortunewouldnt you do it

Naturally I should he agreed

Well suppose it wasnt a gold mine but a business a new system
like those cigar storesorsome patent amusement specialtyor
_anything_that you knew was better than what youre doingwouldnt
you have a right to try it

Of course I shouldbut what has that to do with this case

Why its the same thing Dont you see I have plans that will be of
real benefit to all of us something worth while to _do_and not only
for us but for _everybody_a real piece of progressand Im going
to leave my peopleand even youfor a little whileto make us all
happier later on

He smiled lovingly at her but shook his head slowly You dear brave
foolish child he said I dont for one moment doubt your noble
purposes But you dont get the mans point of viewnaturally Whats
more you dont seem to get the womans

Can you see no other point of view than those she asked

There are no others he answered Come come my darling dont add
this new difficulty to what weve got to carry I know you have a hard
time of it at home Some day please God you shall have an easier
one And Im having a hard time tooI dont deny it But you are the
greatest joy and comfort I have dearyou know that If you go awayit
will be harder and slower and longerthats all I shall have you to
worry about too Let somebody else do the goldmine dearyou stay here
and comfort your Mother as long as you canand me How can I get along
without you

He tried to put his arm around her again but she drew back Dear
she said If I deliberately do what I think is rightagainst your
wisheswhat will you do

Do The laughed bitterly What can I do Im tied by the leg hereI
cant go after you Ive nothing to pull you out of a scrape with if you
get in one I couldnt do anything butstand it

And if I go ahead and do what you dont likeand make
yousufferwould youwould you rather be free Her voice was very
low and shaken but he heard her well enough

Free of you Free of _you_ He caught her and held her and kissed her
over and over

You are mine he said You have given yourself to me You cannot
leave me Neither of us is freeever again But she struggled away
from him

Both of us are freeto do what we think right _always_ Ross I
wouldnt try to stop you if you thought it was your duty to go to the
North Pole She held him a little way off Let me tell you dear Sit
downlet me tell you all about it But he wouldnt sit down

I dont think I want to know the details he said It doesnt much
matter what youre going to doif you really go away I cant stop
youI see that If you think this thing is your duty youll do it if
it kills us alland you too If you have to goI shall do nothingcan
do nothingbut wait till you come back to me Whatever happens
darlingno matter how you faildont ever be afraid to come back to
me

He folded his arms nowdid not attempt to hold hergave her the
freedom she asked and promised her the love she had almost feared to
loseand her whole carefully constructed plan seemed like a childs
sand castle for a moment her heroic decision the wildest folly

He was not even looking at her she saw his strong cleancut profile
dark against the moonlit house a settled patience in its lines Duty
Here was duty surely with tenderest happiness She was leaning toward
himher hand was seeking his when she heard through the fragrant
silence a sound from her mothers roomthe faint creak of her light
rocking chair She could not sleepshe was sitting up with her trouble
bearing it quietly as she had so many others

The quiet everyday tragedy of that distasteful lifethe slow withering
away of youth and hope and ambition into a gray waste of ineffectual
submissive labornot only of her life but of thousands upon thousands
like herit all rose up like a flood in the girls hot young heart

Ross had turned to herwas holding out his arms to her You wont go
my darling he said

I am going Wednesday on the 710 said Diantha




CHAPTER IV A CRYING NEED


 Lovest thou me said the Fair Ladye
 And the Lover he said Yea
 Then climb this treefor my sake said she
 And climb it every day
 So from dawn till dark he abrazed the bark
 And wore his clothes away
 Till What has this tree to do with thee
 The Lover at last did say


It was a poor dinner Cold in the first place because Isabel would wait
to thoroughly wash her long artistic hands and put on another dress
She hated the smell of cooking in her garments hated it worse on her
white fingers and now to look at the graceful erect figure the
round throat with the silver necklace about it the soft smooth
hair silverfilletted the negative beauty of the dovecolored gown
specially designed for home evenings one would never dream she had set
the table so welland cooked the steak so abominably


Isabel was never a cook In the many servantless gaps of domestic life
in Orchardina there was always a strained atmosphere in the Porne
household

Dear said Mr Porne might I petition to have the steak less cooked
I know you dont like to do it so why not shorten the process

Im sorry she answered I always forget about the steak from one
time to the next

Yet weve had it three times this week my dear

I thought you liked it better than anything she with marked
gentleness Ill get you other thingsoftener

Its a shame you should have this to do Isabel I never meant you
should cook for me Indeed I didnt dream you cared so little about it

And I never dreamed you cared so much about it she replied still
with repression Im not complaining am I Im only sorry you should
be disappointed in me

Its not _you_ dear girl Youre all right Its just this everlasting
bother Cant you get _anybody_ that will stay

I cant seem to get anybody on any terms so far Im going again
tomorrow Cheer up dearthe baby keeps wellthats the main thing

He sat on the rosebowered porch and smoked while she cleared the table
At first he had tried to help her on these occasions but their methods
were dissimilar and she frankly told him she preferred to do it alone

So she slipped off the silk and put on the gingham again washed the
dishes with the labored accuracy of a trained mind doing unfamiliar
work made the bread redressed at last and joined him about nine
oclock

Its too late to go anywhere I suppose he ventured

Yesand Im too tired Besideswe cant leave Eddie alone

O yesI forget Of course we cant

His hand stole out to take hers I _am_ sorry dear Its awfully rough
on you women out here How do they all stand it

Most of them stand it much better than I do Ned You see they dont
want to be doing anything else

Yes Thats the mischief of it he agreed and she looked at him in
the clear moonlight wondering exactly what he thought the mischief was

Shall we go in and read a bit he offered but she thought not

Im too tired Im afraid And Eddiell wake up as soon as we begin

So they sat awhile enjoying the soft silence and the rich flower scents
about them till Eddie did wake presently and Isabel went upstairs

She slept little that night lying quite still listening to her
husbands regular breathing so near her and the lighter sound from the
crib I am a very happy woman she told herself resolutely but there
was no outpouring sense of love and joy She knew she was happy but by
no means felt it So she stared at the moon shadows and thought it over

She had planned the little house herself with such love such hope
such tender happy care Not her first work which won high praise in the
school in Paris not the prizewinning plan for the library now gracing
Orchardinas prettiest square was as dear to her as this most womanly
taskthe making of a home

It was the library success which brought her here fresh from her
foreign studies and Orchardina accepted with western cordiality the
youth and beauty of the young architect though a bit surprised at first
that I H Wright was an Isabel In her further work of overseeing
the construction of that library she had met Edgar Porne one of
the numerous eager young real estate men of that region who showed a
liberal enthusiasm for the general capacity of women in the professions
and a much warmer feeling for the personal attractions of this one

Together they chose the lot on peppershaded Inez Avenue together they
watched the rising of the concrete walls and planned the garden walks
and seats and the tiny precious pool in the far corner He was so
sympathetic so admiring He took as much pride in the big drawing
room on the third floor as she did herself Architecture is such fine
work to do at home they had both agreed Here you have your north
lightyour big tableplenty of room for work You will grow famouser
and famouser he had lovingly insisted And she had answered I fear I
shall be too contented dear to want to be famous

That was only some year and ahalf agobut Isabel lying there by
her sleeping husband and sleeping child was stark awake and only by
assertion happy She was thinking persistently of dust She loved a
delicate cleanliness Her art was a precise one her studio a workshop
of white paper and fine pointed hard pencils her painting the
mechanical perfection of an even wash of color And she saw through
the floors and walls and the darkness the dust in the little shaded
parlortwo days dust at least and Orchardina is very dustydust in
the diningroom gathered since yesterdaythe dust in the kitchenshe
would not count time there and the dusthere she counted it
inexorablythe dust of eight days in her great light workroom
upstairs Eight days since she had found time to go up there

Lying there wideeyed and motionless she stood outside in thought and
looked at the houseas she used to look at it with him before they
were married Then it had roused every blessed hope and dream of wedded
joyit seemed a casket of uncounted treasures Now in this dreary
mood it seemed not only a mere workshop but one of alien tasks
continuous impossible like those set for the Imprisoned Princess
by bad fairies in the old tales In thought she entered the
wellproportioned doorthe Gate of Happinessand a musty smell greeted
hershe had forgotten to throw out those flowers She turned to the
parlorno the piano keys were gritty one had to clean them twice a
day to keep that room as she liked it

From room to room she flitted in her mind trying to recall the
exquisite things they meant to her when she had planned them and each
one now opened glaring and blank as a place to work inand the work
undone

If I were an abler woman she breathed And then her common sense and
common honesty made her reply to herself I am able enoughin my own
work Nobody can do everything I dont believe Edgard do it any better
than I doHe dont have toand then such a wave of bitterness rushed
over her that she was afraid and reached out one hand to touch the
cribthe other to her husband

He awakened instantly What is it Dear he asked Too tired to
sleep you poor darling But you do love me a little dont you

O _yes_ she answered I do Of _course_ I do Im just tired I
guess Goodnight Sweetheart


She was late in getting to sleep and late in waking

When he finally sat down to the hurriedly spread breakfasttable Mr
Porne long coffeeless found it a bit difficult to keep his temper
Isabel was a little stiff bringing in dishes and cups and paying no
attention to the sounds of wailing from above

Well if you wont I will burst forth the father at last and ran
upstairs returning presently with a fine boy of some eleven months who
ceased to bawl in these familiar arms and contented himself for the
moment with a teaspoon

Arent you going to feed him asked Mr Porne with forced patience

It isnt time yet she announced wearily He has to have his bath
first

Well with a patience evidently forced farther isnt it time to feed
me

Im very sorry she said The oatmeal is burned again Youll have
to eat cornflakes Andthe cream is sourthe ice didnt comeor at
least perhaps I was out when it cameand then I forgot it I had
to go to the employment agency in the morning Im sorry Im soso
incompetent

So am I he commented drily Are there any crackers for instance And
how about coffee

She brought the coffee such as it was and a can of condensed milk
Also crackers and fruit She took the baby and sat silent

Shall I come home to lunch he asked

Perhaps youd better not she replied coldly

Is there to be any dinner

Dinner will be ready at sixthirty if I have to get it myself

If you have to get it yourself Ill allow for seventhirty said he
trying to be cheerful though she seemed little pleased by it
Now dont take it so hard Ellie You are a firstclass architect
anyhowone cant be everything Well get another girl in time This is
just the common lot out here All the women have the same trouble

Most women seem better able to meet it she burst forth Its not
my trade Im willing to work I like to work but I cant _bear_
housework I cant seem to learn it at all And the servants will not do
it properly

Perhaps they know your limitations and take advantage of them But
cheer up dear Its no killing matter Order by phone dont forget the
ice and Ill try to get home early and help Dont cry dear girl I
love you even if you arent a good cook And you love me dont you

He kissed her till she had to smile back at him and give him a loving
hug but after he had gone the gloom settled upon her spirits once
more She bathed the baby fed him put him to sleep and came back to
the table The screen door had been left ajar and the house was buzzing
with flies hot with a weeks accumulating disorder The bread she
made last night in fear and trembling was hanging fatly over the pans
perhaps sour already She clapped it into the oven and turned on the
heat

Then she stood undetermined looking about that messy kitchen while the
big flies bumped and buzzed on the windows settled on every dish and
swung in giddy circles in the middle of the room Turning swiftly she
shut the door on them The diningroom was nearly as bad She began
to put the cups and plates together for removal but set her tray down
suddenly and went into the comparative coolness of the parlor closing
the diningroom door behind her

She was quite tired enough to cry after several nights of broken rest
and days of constant discomfort and irritation but a sense of rising
anger kept the tears back

Of course I love him she said to herself aloud but softly
remembering the baby And no doubt he loves me Im glad to be his
wife Im glad to be a mother to his child Im glad I married him
But_this_ is not what he offered And its not what I undertook He
hasnt had to change his business

She marched up and down the scant space and then stopped short and
laughed drily continuing her smothered soliloquy

Do you love me they ask and I will make you happy they say and
you get marriedand after that its Housework

They dont say Will you be my Cook Will you be my Chamber maid
Will you give up a good clean wellpaid business that you lovethat
has big hope and power and beauty in itand come and keep house for
me

Love him Id be in Paris this minute if I didnt What has love to
do with dust and grease and flies

Then she did drop on the small sofa and cry tempestuously for a little
while but soon arose fiercely ashamed of her weakness and faced the
day thinking of the old lady who had so much to do she couldnt think
what to firstso she sat down and made a pincushion

Thenwhere to begin

Eddie will sleep till halfpast tenif Im lucky Its now nearly
halfpast nine she meditated aloud If I do the upstairs work I might
wake him I mustnt forget the bread the dishes the parlorO those
flies WellIll clear the table first

Stepping softly and handling the dishes with slow care she cleaned the
breakfast table and darkened the diningroom flapping out some of the
flies with a towel Then she essayed the parlor dusting and arranging
with undecided steps It _ought_ to be swept she admitted to herself
I cant do itthere isnt time Ill make it dark

Id rather plan a dozen houses she fiercely muttered as she fussed
about YesId rather build emthan to keep one clean

Then were her hopes dashed by a rising wail from above She sat quite
still awhile hoping against hope that he would sleep again but he
wouldnt So she brought him down in full cry

In her low chair by the window she held him and produced bright and
jingling objects from the tall workbasket that stood near by sighing
again as she glanced at its accumulated mending

Master Eddy grew calm and happy in her arms but showed a growing
interest in the pleasing materials produced for his amusement and a
desire for closer acquaintance Then a penetrating odor filled the air
and with a sudden O dear she rose put the baby on the sofa and
started toward the kitchen

At this moment the doorbell rang

Mrs Porne stopped in her tracks and looked at the door It remained
opaque and immovable She looked at the babywho jiggled his spools and
crowed Then she flew to the oven and dragged forth the bread not much
burned after all Then she opened the door

A nice looking young woman stood before her in a plain travelling suit
holding a cheap dresssuit case in one hand and a denim rollbag in
the other who met her with a cheerful inquiring smile

Are you Mrs Edgar Porne she asked

I am answered that lady somewhat shortly her hand on the doorknob
her ear on the baby her nose still remorsefully in the kitchen her
eyes fixed sternly on her visitor the while as she wondered whether it
was literature cosmetics or medicine

She was about to add that she didnt want anything when the young
lady produced a card from the Rev Benjamin A Miner Mrs Pornes
particularly revered minister and stated that she had heard there was a
vacancy in her kitchen and she would like the place

Introducing Mrs D Bell well known to friends of mine

I dont know said Mrs Porne reading the card without in the least
grasping what it said I

Just then there was a dull falling sound followed by a sharp rising one
and she rushed into the parlor without more words

When she could hear and be heard again she found Mrs Bell seated
in the shadowy little hall serene and cool I called on Mr Miner
yesterday when I arrived said she with letters of introduction from
my former minister told him what I wanted to do and asked him if he
could suggest anyone in immediate need of help in this line He said
he had called here recently and believed you were looking for someone
Here is the letter I showed him and she handed Mrs Porne a most
friendly and appreciative recommendation of Miss D Bell by a minister
in Jopalez Inca Co stating that the bearer was fully qualified to
do all kinds of housework experienced honest kind had worked seven
years in one place and only left it hoping to do better in Southern
California

Backed by her own pastors approval this seemed to Mrs Porne fully
sufficient The look of the girl pleased her though suspiciously
above her station in manner service of any sort was scarce and high in
Orchardina and she had been an agelong week without any When can you
come she asked

I can stop now if you like said the stranger This is my baggage
But we must arrange terms first If you like to try me I will come this
week from noon today to noon next Friday for seven dollars and then
if you are satisfied with my work we can make further arrangements I do
not do laundry work of course and dont undertake to have any care of
the baby

I take care of my baby myself said Mrs Porne thinking the new girl
was presuming though her manner was most gently respectful But a week
was not long she was well recommended and the immediate pressure
in that kitchen where the harvest was so ripe and the laborers so
fewWellyou may try the week she said Ill show you your room
And what is your name

Miss Bell




CHAPTER V

 When the fig growns on the thistle
 And the silk purse on the sow
 When one swallow brings the summer
 And blue moons on her brow

 Then we may look for strength and skill
 Experience good health good will
 Art and science well combined
 Honest soul and able mind
 Servants built upon this plan
 One to wait on every man
 Patiently from youth to age
 For less than a street cleaners wage

 When the parsons gay on Mondays
 When we meet a month of Sundays
 We may look for them and find them
 But Not Now


When young Mrs Weatherstone swept her trailing crepe from the
automobile to her friends door it was opened by a quick softfooted
maid with a pleasant face who showed her into a parlor not only cool
and flowerlit but having that fresh smell that tells of newwashed
floors

Mrs Porne came flying down to meet her with such a look of rest and
comfort as roused instant notice

Why Belle I havent seen you look so bright in ever so long It must
be the new maid

Thats itshes Bell tooMiss Bell if you please

The visitor looked puzzled Is she aa friend she ventured not sure
of her ground

I should say she was A friend in need Sit here by the window
Vivaand Ill tell you all about itas far as it goes

She gaily recounted her climax of confusion and weariness and the
sudden appearance of this ministering angel She arrived at about
quarter of ten I engaged her inside of five minutes She was into a
gingham gown and at work by ten oclock

What promptness And I suppose there was plenty to do

Mrs Porne laughed unblushingly There was enough for ten women it
seemed to me Lets seeits about five nowseven hours We have nine
rooms besides the halls and stairs and my shop She hasnt touched
that yet But the house is clean_clean_ Smell it

She took her guest out into the hall through the library and
diningroom upstairs where the pleasant bedrooms stretched open and
orderly

She said that if I didnt mind shed give it a superficial general
cleaning today and be more thorough later

Mrs Weatherstone looked about her with a rather languid interest Im
very glad for you Belle dearbutwhat an endless nuisance it all
isdont you think so

Nuisance Its slow death to me at least Mrs Porne answered But
I dont see why you should mind I thought Madam Weatherstone ran
thatpalace of yours and you didnt have any trouble at all

Oh yes she runs it I couldnt get along with her at all if she
didnt Thats her life It was my mothers too Always fussing and
fussing Their houses on their backslike snails

Dont see why with ten or is it fifteen servants

Its twenty I think But my dear Belle if you imagine that when you
have twenty servants you have neither work nor carecome and try it
awhile thats all

Not for a millionaire babys ransom answered Isabel promptly

Give me my drawing tools and plans and Im happybut this
businessshe swept a white hand wearily aboutits not my work
thats all

But you _enjoy_ it dont youI mean having nice things asked her
friend

Of course I enjoy it but so does Edgar Cant a woman enjoy her home
just as a man does without running the shop I enjoy ocean travel but
I dont want to be either a captain or a common sailor

Mrs Weatherstone smiled a little sadly Youre lucky you have
other interests she said How about our bungalow have you got any
farther

Mrs Porne flushed Im sorry Viva You ought to have given it to
someone else I havent gone into that workroom for eight solid days No
help and the baby you know And I was always dogtired

Thats all right dear theres no very great rush You can get at it
now cant youwith this other Belle to the fore

Shes not Belle bless youshes Miss Bell Its her last name

Mrs Weatherstone smiled her faint smile Wellwhy not Like a
seamstress I suppose

Exactly Thats what she said If this labor was as important as that
of seamstress or governess why not the same courtesyOh shes a most
superior _and_ opinionated young person I can see that

I like her looks admitted Mrs Weatherstone but cant we look over
those plans again theres something I wanted to suggest And they went
up to the big room on the third floor

In her shop and at her work Isabel Porne was a different woman She
was eager and yet calm full of ideas and ideals yet with a practical
knowledge of details that made her houses dear to the souls of women

She pointed out in the new drawings the practical advantages of kitchen
and pantry the simple but thorough ventilation the deep closets till
her friend fairly laughed at her And you say youre not domestic

Im a domestic architect if you like said Isabel but not a
domestic servantIll remember what you say about those windowsits
a good idea and she made a careful note of Mrs Weatherstones
suggestion

That lady pushed the plans away from her and went to the many cushioned
lounge in the wide west window where she sat so long silent that Isabel
followed at last and took her hand

Did you love him so much she asked softly

Who was the surprising answer

WhyMr Weatherstone said Mrs Porne

Nonot very much But he was something

Isabel was puzzled I knew you so well in school she said and
that gay year in Paris You were always a dear submissive quiet little
thingbut not like this Whats happened Viva

Nothing that anybody can help said her friend Nothing that matters
What does matter anyway Fuss and fuss and fuss Dress and entertain
Travel till youre tired and rest till youre crazy Thenwhen a real
thing happenstheres all this and she lifted her black draperies
disdainfully And mourning notepaper and cards and servants
liveryand all the things you mustnt do

Isabel put an arm around her Dont mind dearyoull get over
thisyou are young enough yetthe world is full of things to do

But Mrs Weatherstone only smiled her faint smile again I loved
another man first she said A real one He died He never cared
for me at all I cared for nothing elsenothing in life Thats why
I married Martin Weatherstonenot for his old millionsbut he really
caredand I was sorry for him Now hes dead And Im wearing thisand
still mourning for the other one

Isabel held her hand stroked it softly laid it against her cheek

Oh Ill feel differently in time perhaps said her visitor

Maybe if you took hold of the houseif you ran things
yourselfventured Mrs Porne

Mrs Weatherstone laughed And turn out the old lady You dont know
her Why she managed her son till he ran away from herand after he got
so rich and imported her from Philadelphia to rule over Orchardina in
general and his household in particular she managed that poor little
first wife of his into her grave and that wretched boyhes the
only person that manages her Shes utterly spoiled himthat was his
fathers constant grief No nolet her run the houseshe thinks she
owns it

Shes fond of you isnt she asked Mrs Porne

O I guess soif I let her have her own way And she certainly saves me
a great deal of trouble Speaking of trouble there they areshe said
shed stop for me

At the gate puffed the big car a person in livery rang the bell and
Mrs Weatherstone kissed her friend warmly and passed like a heavy
shadow along the rosebordered path In the tonneau sat a massive old
lady in sober silks with a set impassive countenance severely correct
in every feature and young Mat Weatherstone sulky because he had to
ride with his grandmother now and then He was not a nice young man



Diantha found it hard to write her home letters especially to Ross She
could not tell them of all she meant to do and she must tell them of
this part of it at once before they heard of it through others

To leave hometo leave schoolteaching to leave loveand go out to
service did not seem a step up that was certain But she set her red
lips tighter and wrote the letters wrote them and mailed them that
evening tired though she was

Three letters came back quickly

Her mothers answer was affectionate patient and trustful though not
understanding

Her sisters was as unpleasant as she had expected

The _idea_ wrote Mrs Susie A girl with a good home to live in and
another to look forward toand able to earn money _respectably_ to
go out and work like a common Irish girl Why Gerald is so mortified he
cant face his friendsand Im as ashamed as I can be My own sister
You must be _crazy_simply _crazy_

It was hard on them Diantha had faced her own difficulties bravely
enough and sympathized keenly with her mother and with Ross but she
had not quite visualized the mortification of her relatives She found
tears in her eyes over her mothers letter Her sisters made her both
sorry and angrya most disagreeable feelingas when you step on the
cat on the stairs Rosss letter she held some time without opening

She was in her little upstairs room in the evening She had swept
scoured scalded and carbolized it and the hospitally smell was now
giving way to the soft richness of the outer air The hoo hoo of the
little mourning owl came to her ears through the whispering night and
large moths beat noiselessly against the window screen She kissed the
letter again held it tightly to her heart for a moment and opened it

Dearest I have your letter with itssomewhat surprisingnews It is
a comfort to know where you are that you are settled and in no danger

I can readily imagine that this is but the preliminary to something
else as you say so repeatedly and I can understand also that you are
too wise to tell me all you mean to be beforehand

I will be perfectly frank with you Dear

In the first place I love you I shall love you always whatever you
do But I will not disguise from you that this whole business seems to
me unutterably foolish and wrong

I suppose you expect by some mysterious process to develope and
elevate this housework business and to make money I should not love
you any better if you made a millionand I would not take money from
youyou know that I hope If in the years we must wait before we can
marry you are happier away from meworking in strange kitchensor
officesthat is your affair

I shall not argue nor plead with you Dear Girl I know you think you
are doing right and I have no right nor power to prevent you But
if my wish were right and power you would be here tonight under the
shadow of the acacia boughsin my arms

Any time you feel like coming back you will be welcome Dear

Yours Ross

Any time she felt like coming back

Diantha slipped down in a little heap by the bed her face on the
letterher arms spread wide The letter grew wetter and wetter and her
shoulders shook from time to time

But the hands were tightclenched and if you had been near enough you
might have heard a dogged repetition monotonous as a Tibetan prayer
mill It is right It is right It is right And then Help
meplease I need it Diantha was not gifted in prayer


When Mr Porne came home that night he found the wifely smile which is
supposed to greet all returning husbands quite genuinely in evidence O
Edgar cried she in a triumphant whisper Ive got such a nice
girl Shes just as neat and quick youve no idea the work shes done
todayit looks like another place already But if things look queer
at dinner dont notice itfor Ive just given her her head I was so
tired and baby bothered so and she said that perhaps she could
manage all by herself if I was willing to risk it so I took baby for a
carride and have only just got back And I _think_ the dinners going
to be lovely

It was lovely The diningroom was cool and flyless The table was set
with an assured touch A few of Orchardinas ever ready roses in a glass
bowl gave an air of intended beauty Mrs Porne had had no time for

The food was wellcooked and wellserved and the attendance showed an
intelligent appreciation of when people want things and how they want
them

Mrs Porne quite glowed with exultation but her husband gently
suggested that the newness of the broom was visibly uppermost and that
such palpable perfections were probably accompanied by some drawbacks
But he liked her looks he admitted and the cooking would cover a
multitude of sins

On this they rested while the week went by It was a full week and
a short one Mrs Porne making hay while the sun shone caught up a
little in her sewing and made some consciencetormenting calls

When Thursday night came around she was simply running over with
information to give her husband

Such a talk as I have had with Miss Bell She is so queer But shes
nice too and its all reasonable enough what she says You know shes
studied this thing all out and she knows about itstatistics and
things I was astonished till I found she used to teach school Just
think of it And to be willing to work out She certainly does her work
beautiful butit doesnt seem like having a servant at all I feel as
if Iboarded with her

Why she seemed to me very modest and unpresuming put in Mr Porne

O yes she never presumes But I mean the capable way she managesI
dont have to tell her one thing nor to oversee nor criticize I spoke
of it and she said If I didnt understand the business I should have
no right to undertake it

Thats a new point of view isnt it asked her husband Dont they
usually make you teach them their trade and charge for the privilege

Yes of course they do But then she does have her disadvantagesas
you said

Does she What are they

Why shes sorigid Ill read you herI dont know what to call it
Shes written out a definite proposition as to her staying with us and
I want you to study it its the queerest thing I ever saw

The document was somewhat novel A clear statement of the hours of labor
required in the position the quality and amount of the different kinds
of work the terms on which she was willing to undertake it and all
prefaced by a few remarks on the status of household labor which made
Mr Porne open his eyes

Thus Miss Bell The ordinary rate for labor in this state unskilled
labor of the ordinary sort is 200 a day This is in return for
the simplest exertion of brute force under constant supervision and
direction and involving no serious risk to the employer

Household labor calls for the practice of several distinct crafts
and to be properly done requires thorough training and experience
Its performer is not only in a position of confidence as necessarily
entrusted with the care of the employers goods and with knowledge of
the most intimate family relations but the work itself in maintaining
the life and health of the members of the household is of most vital
importance

In consideration of existing economic conditions however I am willing
to undertake these intricate and responsible duties for a seven day week
at less wages than are given the streetdigger for 150 a day

Good gracious my dear said Mr Porne laying down the paper This
young woman does appreciate her business And were to be let off easy
at 4500 a month are we

And feel under obligations at that answered his wife But you read
ahead It is most instructive We shall have to ask her to read a paper
for the Club

In further consideration of the conditions of the time I am willing
to accept part payment in board and lodging instead of cash Such
accommodations as are usually offered with this position may be rated at
1700 a month

O come now dont we board her any better than that

Thats what I thought and I asked her about it and she explained that
she could get a room as good for a dollar and ahalf a weekshe had
actually made inquiries in this very town And she could really a
better room better furnished that is and service with it You know
Ive always meant to get the girls room fixed more prettily but
usually they dont seem to mind And as to foodyou see she knows all
about the cost of things and the materials she consumes are really not
more than two dollars and a half a week if they are that She even made
some figures for me to prove itsee

Mr Porne had to laugh

Breakfast Coffee at thirtyfive cents per pound one cup one cent
Oatmeal at fourteen cents per package one bowl one cent Bread at five
cents per loaf two slices onehalf cent Butter at forty cents per
pound one piece one and ahalf cents Oranges at thirty cents per
dozen one three cents Milk at eight cents per quart on oatmeal one
cent Meat or fish or egg average five cents Totalthirteen cents

There And she showed me dinner and lunch the same way I had no idea
food just the material cost so little Its the labor she says that
makes it cost even in the cheapest restaurant

I see said Mr Porne And in the case of the domestic servant we
furnish the materials and she furnishes the labor She cooks her own
food and waits on herselfnaturally it wouldnt come high What does
she make it

 Food average per day035
 Room 150 per wk ave per day22
 
 57

 Total per month 1710

 150 per day per month 4500

Remaining payable in cash 2800 Do I still live But my dear
Ellie thats only what an ordinary firstclass cook charges out here
without all this fuss

I know it Ned but you know we think its awful and were always
telling about their getting their board and lodging clearas if we
gaveem that out of the goodness of our hearts

Exactly my dear And this amazing and arithmetical young woman makes
us feel as if we were giving her wampum instead of moneymere primitive
barter of ancient days in return for her twentieth century services How
does she do her workthats the main question

I never saw anyone do it better or quicker or easier That is I
thought it was easy till she brought me this paper Just read about her
work and youll feel as if we ought to pay her all your salary

Mr Porne read

Labor performed average ten hours a day as follows Preparation of
food materials care of fires cooking table service and cleaning of
dishes utensils towels stove etc per mealbreakfast two hours
dinner three hours supper or lunch one hoursix hours per day for food
service Daily chamber work and dusting etc one and onehalf hours
per day Weekly cleaning for house of nine rooms with halls stairs
closets porches steps walks etc sweeping dusting washing
windows mopping scouring etc averaging two hours per day Door
service waiting on tradesmen and extras onehalf hour per day Total
ten hours per day

That sounds well Does it take that much time every day

Yes indeed It would take me twenty she answered You know the week
I was here alone I never did half she does Of course I had Baby but
then I didnt do the things I guess when it doesnt take so long they
just dont do what ought to be done For she is quick awfully quick
about her work And shes thorough I suppose it ought to be done that
waybut I never had one before

She keeps mighty fresh and brightlooking after these herculean
labors

Yes but then she rests Her ten hours are from sixthirty am
when she goes into the kitchen as regularly as a cuckoo clock to
eightthirty pm when she is all through and her kitchen looks like
awell its as clean and orderly as if no one was ever in it

Ten hoursthats fourteen

I know it but she takes out four She claims time to eat her meals

Preposterous

Half an hour apiece and half an hour in the morning to restand two
in the afternoon Anyway she is out two hours every afternoon riding
in the electric cars

That dont look like a very hard job Her day laborer doesnt get two
hours off every afternoon to take excursions into the country

No I know that but he doesnt begin so early nor stop so late She
does her square ten hours work and I suppose one has a right to time
off

You seem dubious about that my dear

Yes thats just where its awkward Im used to girls being in all the
time excepting their day out You see I cant leave baby nor always
take himand it interferes with my freedom afternoons

Wellcant you arrange with her somehow

See if you can She says she will only give ten hours of time for a
dollar and a half a daytisnt but fifteen cents an hourI have to
pay a woman twenty that comes in And if she is to give up her chance
of sunlight and fresh air she wants me to pay her extraby the hour Or
she says if I prefer she would take four hours every other dayand so
be at home half the time I said it was difficult to arrangewith baby
and she was very sympathetic and nice but she wont alter her plans

Let her go and get a less exacting servant

Butshe does her work so well And it saves a lot really She knows
all about marketing and things and plans the meals so as to have things
lap and its a comfort to have her in the house and feel so safe and
sure everything will be done right

Well its your province my dear I dont profess to advise But I
assure you I appreciate the table and the cleanness of everything and
the rested look in your eyes dear girl

She slipped her hand into his affectionately It does make a
difference she said I _could_ get a girl for 2000 and save nearly
260 a weekbut you know what they are

I do indeed he admitted fervently Its worth the money to have this
thing done so well I think shes right about the wages Better keep
her

Oshell only agree to stay six months even at this rate

Wellkeep her six months and be thankful I thought she was too good
to last

They looked over the offered contract again It closed with

This agreement to hold for six months from date if mutually
satisfactory In case of disagreement two weeks notice is to be given
on either side or two weeks wages if preferred by the employer It
was dated and signed Miss D C Bell

And with inward amusement and great display of penmanship they added
Mrs Isabel J Porne and the contract was made




CHAPTER VI THE CYNOSURE


 Its a singular thing that the commonest place
 Is the hardest to properly fill
 That the labor imposed on a full half the race
 Is so seldom performed with good will
 To say nothing of knowledge or skill

 What we ask of all women we stare at in one
 And tribute of wonderment bring
 If this task of the million is once fitly done
 We all hold our hands up and sing
 Its really a singular thing


Isabel Porne was a cautious woman and made no acclaim over her new
acquisition until its value was proven Her husband also bided his
time and when congratulated on his improved appearance and air of
contentment merely vouchsafed that his wife had a new girl who could
cook

To himself he boasted that he had a new wife who could loveso cheerful
and gay grew Mrs Porne in the changed atmosphere of her home

It is remarkable Edgar she said dilating repeatedly on the peculiar
quality of their good fortune Its not only good cooking and good
waiting and a clean housecleaner than I ever saw one before and its
not only the quietness and regularity and economywhy the bills have
gone down more than a third

Yeseven I noticed that he agreed

But what I enjoy the most is the _atmosphere_ she continued When I
have to do the work the house is a perfect nightmare to me She leaned
forward from her low stool her elbows on her knees her chin in her
hands and regarded him intently

Edgar You know I love you And I love my babyIm no unfeeling
monster But I can tell you frankly that if Id had any idea of what
housework was like Id never have given up architecture to try it

Lucky for me you hadnt said he fondly I know its been hard
for you little girl I never meant that you should give up
architecturethats a business a woman could carry on at home I
thought the designing part anyway Theres your drawingroom and all
your things

Yes she said with reminiscent bitterness there they areand there
they might have stayed untouchedif Miss Bell hadnt come

Makes you call her Miss Bell all the time does she

Mrs Porne laughed Yes I hated it at first but she asked if I could
give her any real reason why the cook should be called by her first
name more than the seamstress or governess I tried to say that it was
shorter but she smiled and said that in this case it was longerHer
name is DianthaIve seen it on letters And it is one syllable longer
Anyhow Ive got used to Miss Bell now

She gets letters often

Yesvery oftenfrom Topolaya where she came from Im afraid shes
engaged Mrs Porne sighed ruefully

I dont doubt it said Mr Porne That would account for her six
months arrangement Well my dearmake hay while the sun shines

I do she boasted Whole stacks Ive had a seamstress in and got
all my clothes in order and the babys Weve had lot of dinnerparties
and teas as you knowall my social obligations are cleared off Weve
had your mother for a visit and mines coming nowand I wasnt
afraid to have either of them Theres no fault to be found with my
housekeeping now And there are two things better than thatyes
three

The best thing is to see you look so young and handsome and happy
again said her husband with a kiss

Yesthats one Another is that now I feel so easy and lighthearted
I can love you and babyasas I _do_ Only when Im tired and
discouraged I cant put my hand on it somehow

He nodded sympathetically I know dear he said I feel that way
myselfsometimes Whats the other

Why thats best of all she cried triumphantly I can Work again
When Babys asleep I get hours at a time and even when hes awake Ive
fixed a place where he can playand I can draw and planjust as I used
to_better_ than I used to

And that is even more to you than loving he asked in a quiet
inquiring voice

Its more because it means _both_ She leaned to him glowing Dont
you see First I had the work and loved it Then you cameand I loved
youbetter Then Baby came and I loved himbest I dont knowyou and
baby are all one somehow

There was a brief interim and then she drew back blushing richly
Now stopI want to explain When the housework got to be such a
nightmareand I looked forward to a whole lifetime of it and _no_
improvement then I just _ached_ for my workand couldnt do it And
thenwhy sometimes dear I just wanted to run away Actually From
_both_ of youyou see I spent five years studyingI was a _real_
architectand it did hurt to see it go And nowO now Ive got It and
You too darling _And_ the BabyO Im so happy

Thanks to the Providential Miss Bell said he If shell stay Ill
pay her anything

The months went by

Peace order comfort cleanliness and economy reigned in the Porne
household and the lady of the house blossomed into richer beauty and
happiness her contentment marred only by a sense of flying time

Miss Bell fulfilled her carefully specified engagement to the letter
rested her peaceful hour in the morning walked and rode in the
afternoon familiarized herself with the length and breadth of the
town and visited continuously among the servants of the neighborhood
establishing a large and friendly acquaintance If she wore rubber
gloves about the rough work she paid for them herself and she washed
and ironed her simple and pretty costumes herselfwith the result that
they stayed pretty for surprising periods

She wrote letters long and loving to Ross daily to her mother twice a
week and by the help of her sisters authority succeeded in maintaining
a fairly competent servant in her deserted place

Father was bound he wouldnt her sister wrote her but I stood right
up to him I can now Im marriedand Gerald toothat hed no right to
take it out of mother even if he was mad with you He made a fuss about
your paying for the girlbut that was only showing off_he_ couldnt
pay for her just nowthats certain And she does very wella
good strong girl and quite devoted to mother And then she scolded
furiously about her sisters working out

Diantha knew just how hard it was for her mother She had faced all
sides of the question before deciding

Your mother misses you badly of course Ross wrote her I go in
as often as I can and cheer her up a bit Its not just the workshe
misses you By the wayso do I He expressed his views on her new
employment

Diantha used to cry over her letters quite often But she would put them
away dry her eyes and work on at the plans she was maturing with grim
courage Its hard on them now she would say to herself Its hard
on mesome But well all be better off because of it and not only
usbut everybody

Meanwhile the happy and unhappy households of the fair town buzzed in
comment and grew green with envy

In social circles and church circles and club circles as also in
domestic circles it was noised abroad that Mrs Edgar Porne had solved
the servant question News of this marvel of efficiency and propriety
was discussed in every household and not only so but in barbershops
and other downtown meeting places mentioned Servants gathered it at
dinnertables and Diantha much amused regathered it from her new
friends among the servants


Does she keep on just the same asked little Mrs Ree of Mrs Porne in
an awed whisper

Just the same if not better I dont even order the meals now unless I
want something especial She keeps a calendar of what weve had to eat
and what belongs to the time of year prices and things When I used
to ask her to suggest one does you know it is so hard to think up a
variety shed always be ready with an idea or remind me that we had
had so and so two days before till I asked her if shed like to order
and she said shed be willing to try and now I just sit down to the
table without knowing whats going to be there

But I should think that would interfere with your sense of freedom
said Mrs Ellen A Dankshire A woman should be mistress of her own
household

Why I am I order whenever I specially want anything But she really
does it moremore scientifically She has made a study of it And the
bills are very much lower

Well I think you are the luckiest woman alive sighed Mrs Ree I
wish I had her

Many a woman wished she had her and some calling when they knew Mrs
Porne was out or descending into their own kitchens of an evening
when the strange Miss Bell was visiting the help made flattering
propositions to her to come to them She was perfectly polite and
agreeable in manner but refused all blandishments

What are you getting at your present placeif I may ask loftily
inquired the great Mrs Thaddler ponderous and beaded

There is surely no objection to your asking madam she replied
politely Mrs Porne will not mind telling you I am sure

Hm said the patronizing visitor regarding her through her lorgnette
Very good Whatever it is Ill double it When can you come

My engagement with Mrs Porne is for six months Diantha answered
and I do not wish to close with anyone else until that time is up
Thank you for your offer just the same

Peculiarly offensive young person said Mrs Thaddler to her husband
Looks to me like one of these literary imposters Mrs Porne will
probably appear in the magazines before long

Mr Thaddler instantly conceived a liking for the young person sight
unseen

Diantha acquired quite a list of offers places open to her as soon
as she was free at prices from her present seven dollars up to the
proposed doubling

Fourteen dollars a week and foundthats not so bad she meditated
That would mean over 650 clear in a year Its a wonder to me girls
dont try it long enough to get a start at something else With even two
or three hundred aheadand an outfitit would be easier to make good
in a store or any other way WellI have other fish to fry

So she pursued her way and with Mrs Pornes permissionheld a sort
of girls club in her spotless kitchen one evening a week during the
last three months of her engagement It was a Study and Amusement
Club She gave them short and interesting lessons in arithmetic in
simple dressmaking in easy and thorough methods of housework She gave
them lists of books referred them to articles in magazines insidiously
taught them to use the Public Library

They played pleasant games in the second hour and grew well acquainted
To the eye or ear of any casual visitor it was the simplest and most
natural affair calculated to elevate labor and to make home happy

Diantha studied and observed They brought her their poor confidences
painfully similar Always povertyor they would not be there Always
ignorance or they would not stay there Then either incompetence in the
work or inability to hold their little earningsor both and further
the Tale of the Other Sidethe exactions and restrictions of the
untrained mistresses they served cases of withheld wages cases of
endless requirements cases of most arbitrary interference with their
receiving friends and followers or going out and cases common
enough to be horrible of insult they could only escape by leaving

Its no wages of courseand no recommendation when you leave like
thatbut what else can a girl do if shes honest

So Diantha learned made friends and laid broad foundations

The excellence of her cocking was known to many thanks to the weekly
entertainments No one refused No one regretted acceptance Never had
Mrs Porne enjoyed such a sense of social importance

All the people she ever knew called on her afresh and people she
never knew called on her even more freshly Not that she was directly
responsible for it She had not triumphed cruelly over her less happy
friends nor had she cried aloud on the street corners concerning her
good fortune It was not her fault nor in truth anyones But in a
community where the servant question is even more vexed than in
the country at large where the local product is quite unequal to the
demand and where distance makes importation an expensive matter the
fact of one womans having as it appeared settled this vexed question
was enough to give her prominence

Mrs Ellen A Dankshire President of the Orchardina Home and Culture
Club took up the matter seriously

Now Mrs Porne said she settling herself vigorously into a
comfortable chair I just want to talk the matter over with you with a
view to the club We do not know how long this will last

Dont speak of it said Mrs Porne

and it behooves us to study the facts while we have them

So much is involved said little Mrs Ree the Corresponding
Secretary lifting her pale earnest face with the perplexed fine lines
in it We are all so truly convinced of the sacredness of the home
duties

Well what do you want me to do asked their hostess

We must have that remarkable young woman address our club Mrs
Dankshire announced It is one case in a thousand and must be
studied

So noble of her said Mrs Ree You say she was really a
schoolteacher Mrs Thaddler has put it about that she is one of these
dreadful writing personsin disguise

O no said Mrs Porne She is perfectly straightforward about it and
had the best of recommendations She was a teacher but it didnt agree
with her health I believe

Perhaps there is a story to it Mrs Ree advanced but Mrs Dankshire
disagreed with her flatly

The young woman has a theory I believe and she is working it out I
respect her for it Now what we want to ask you Mrs Porne is this do
you think it would make any trouble for youin the household relations
you knowif we ask her to read a paper to the Club Of course we do not
wish to interfere but it is a remarkable opportunityvery You know
the fine work Miss Lucy Salmon has done on this subject and Miss
Frances Kellor You know how little data we have and how great how
serious a question it is daily becoming Now here is a young woman of
brains and culture who has apparently grappled with the question her
example and influence must not be lost We must hear from her The
public must know of this

Such an ennobling example murmured Mrs Ree It might lead numbers
of other schoolteachers to see the higher side of the home duties

Furthermore pursued Mrs Dankshire this has occured to me Would it
not be well to have our ladies bring with them to the meeting the more
intelligent of their servants that they might hear and see thethe
dignity of household laborso ably set forth

Isnt itwouldnt that be aan almost dangerous experiment urged
Mrs Ree her high narrow forehead fairly creped with little wrinkles
She mightsay something you know that they mighttake advantage
of

Nonsense my dear replied Mrs Dankshire She was very fond of Mrs
Ree but had small respect for her judgment What could she say Look
at what she does And how beautifullyhow perfectlyshe does it I
would wager now_may_ I try an experiment Mrs Porne and she stood
up taking out her handkerchief

Certainly said Mrs Porne with pleasure You wont find any

Mrs Dankshire climbed heavily upon a carefully selected chair and
passed her large clean plainhemmed handkerchief across the top of a
picture

I knew it she proclaimed proudly from her eminence and showed the
cloth still white That she continued in ponderous descent that is
Knowledge Ability and Conscience

I dont see how she gets the time breathed Mrs Ree shaking her head
in awed amazement and reflecting that she would not dare trust Mrs
Dankshires handkerchief on her picture tops

We must have her address the Club the president repeated It will do
worlds of good Let me seea paper onwe might say On the True Nature
of Domestic Industry How does that strike you Mrs Ree

Admirable said Mrs Ree So strong so succinct

That certainly covers the subject said Mrs Porne Why dont you ask
her

We will We have come for that purpose But we felt it right to ask you
about it first said Mrs Dankshire

Why I have no control over Miss Bells movements outside of working
hours answered Mrs Porne And I dont see that it would make any
difference to our relations She is a very selfpoised young woman
but extremely easy to get along with And Im sure she could write a
splendid paper Youd better ask her I think

Would you call her in asked Mrs Dankshire or shall we go out to
the kitchen

Come right out Id like you to see how beautifully she keeps
everything

The kitchen was as clean as the parlor and as prettily arranged Miss
Bell was making her preparation for lunch and stopped to receive the
visitors with a serenely civil airas of a country storekeeper

I am very glad to meet you Miss Bell very glad indeed said Mrs
Dankshire shaking hands with her warmly We have at heard so much of
your beautiful work here and we admire your attitude Now would you be
willing to give a paperor a talkto our club the Home and Culture
Club some Wednesday on The True Nature of Domestic Industry

Mrs Ree took Miss Bells hand with something of the air of a Boston
maiden accosting a saint from Hindoostan If you only would she said
I am sure it would shed light on this great subject

Miss Bell smiled at them both and looked at Mrs Porne inquiringly

I should be delighted to have you do it said her employer I know it
would be very useful

Is there any date set asked Miss Bell

Any Wednesday after February said Mrs Dankshire

WellI will come on the first Wednesday in April If anything should
happen to prevent I will let you know in good season and if you should
wish to postpone or alter the programshould think better of the
ideajust send me word I shall not mind in the least

They went away quite jubilant Miss Bells acceptance was announced
officially at the next clubmeeting and the Home and Culture Club felt
that it was fulfilling its mission




CHAPTER VII HERESY AND SCHISM


 You may talk about religion with a free and open mind
 For ten dollars you may criticize a judge
 You may discuss in politics the newest thing you find
 And open scientific truth to all the deaf and blind
 But theres one place where the brain must never budge

 CHORUS

 Oh the Home is Utterly Perfect
 And all its works within
 To say a word about it
 To criticize or doubt it
 To seek to mend or move it
 To venture to improve it
 Is The Unpardonable Sin

 Old Song


Mr Porne took an afternoon off and came with his wife to hear their
former housemaid lecture As many other men as were able did the same
All the members not bedridden were present and nearly all the guests
they had invited

So many were the acceptances that a downtown hall had been taken the
floor was more than filled and in the gallery sat a block of servant
girls more gorgeous in array than the ladies below whispering excitedly
among themselves The platform recalled a tournament of roses and
sternly important among all that fragrant loveliness sat Mrs Dankshire
in the chair flanked by Miss Torbus the Recording Secretary Miss
Massing the Treasurer and Mrs Ree tremulous with importance in her
official position All these ladies wore an air of high emprise even
more intense than that with which they usually essayed their public
duties They were richly dressed except Miss Torbus who came as near
it as she could

At the side and somewhat in the rear of the President on a chair quite
different from the chair discreetly gowned and of a bafflingly
serene demeanor sat Miss Bell All eyes were upon hereven some opera
glasses

Shes a goodlooker anyhow was one masculine opinion

Shes a peach was another Tell youthe chap that gets her is well
heeled said a third

The ladies bent their hats toward one another and conferred in flowing
whispers and in the gallery eager confidences were exchanged with
giggles

On the small table before Mrs Dankshire shaded by a magnificent bunch
of roses lay that core and crux of all parliamentry dignity the gavel
an instrument no selfrespecting chairwoman may be without yet which
she still approaches with respectful uncertainty

In spite of its large size and high social standing the Orchardina Home
and Culture Club contained some elements of unrest and when the yearly
election of officers came round there was always need for careful work
in practical politics to keep the reins of government in the hands of
the right people

Mrs Thaddler conscious of her New York millions and Madam
Weatherstone conscious of her Philadelphia lineage with Mrs Johnston
A Marrow one of the Boston Marrows was awesomely whispered of her
were the heads of what might be called the conservative party in this
small parliament while Miss Miranda L Eagerson describing herself as
a journalist who held her place in local society largely by virtue of
the tacit dread of what she might do if offendedled the more radical
element

Most of the members were quite content to follow the lead of the solidly
established ladies of Orchard Avenue especially as this leadership
consisted mainly in the pursuance of a masterly inactivity When wealth
and aristocracy combine with that common inertia which we dignify as
conservatism they exert a powerful influence in the great art of
sitting still

Nevertheless there were many alert and conscientious women in this large
membership and when Miss Eagerson held the floor and urged upon the
club some active assistance in the march of events it needed all Mrs
Dankshires generalship to keep them content with marking time

On this auspicious occasion however both sides were agreed in interest
and approval Here was a subject appealing to every woman present and
every man but such few as merely boarded even they had memories and
hopes concerning this question

Solemnly rose Mrs Dankshire her full silks rustling about her and
let one clear tap of the gavel fall into the sea of soft whispering and
guttural murmurs

In the silence that followed she uttered the momentous announcements
The meeting will please come to order We will now hear the reading
of the minutes of the last meeting and so on most conscientiously
through officers reports and committees reports to new business

Perhaps it is their more frequent practice of religious rites perhaps
their devout acceptance of social rulings and the dictates of fashion
perhaps the lifelong reiterance of small duties at home or all these
things together which makes women so seriously letterperfect in
parliamentry usage But these stately ceremonies were ended in course of
time and Mrs Dankshire rose again even more solemn than before and
came forward majestically

Membersand guests she said impressively this is an occasion
which brings pride to the heart of every member of the Home and Culture
Club As our name implies this Club is formed to serve the interests
of The Homethose interests which stand first I trust in every human
heart

A telling pause and the light patter of gloved hands

Its second purpose pursued the speaker with that measured delivery
which showed that her custom as one member put it was to first write
and then commit is to promote the cause of Culture in this community
Our aim is Culture in the broadest sense not only in the curricula of
institutions of learning not only in those spreading branches of study
and research which tempts us on from height to heightproof of
arboreal ancestry that Miss Eagerson confided to a friend whose
choked giggle attracted condemning eyesbut in the more intimate
fields of daily experience

Most of us however widely interested in the higher education are
stilland find in this our highest honorwives and mothers These
novel titles called forth another round of applause

As such continued Mrs Dankshire we all recognize the
difficultthe wellnigh insuperable problems of theshe glanced at
the gallery now paying awed attentiondomestic question

We know how on the one hand our homes yawn unattendedI yawn
while Im attendingeh one gentleman in the rear suggested to
his neighborwhile on the other the ranks of mercenary labor are
overcrowded Why is it that while the peace and beauty the security and
comfort of a good home with easy labor and high pay are open to every
young woman whose circumstances oblige her to toil for her living she
blindly refuses these true advantages and loses her health and too often
what is far more preciousin the din and tumult of the factory or the
dangerous exposure of the public counter

Madam Weatherstone was much impressed at this point and beat her black
fan upon her black glove emphatically Mrs Thaddler also nodded which
meant a good deal from her The applause was most gratifying to the
speaker who continued

Fortunately for the world there are some women yet who appreciate the
true values of life A faint blush crept slowly up the face of Diantha
but her expression was unchanged Whoso had met and managed a roomful of
merciless children can easily face a womans club

We have with us on this occasion one as we my say our equal in birth
and breedingMadam Weatherstone here looked painfully shocked as also
did the Boston Marrow possibly Mrs Dankshire whose parents were Iowa
farmers was not unmindful of this but she went on smoothly and
whose first employment was the honored task of the teacher who has
deliberately cast her lot with the domestic worker and brought
her trained intelligence to bear upon the solution of this great
questionThe True Nature of Domestic Service In the interests of this
problem she has consented to address usI take pleasure in introducing
Miss Diantha Bell

Diantha rose calmly stepped forward bowed to the President and
officers and to the audience She stood quietly for a moment regarding
the faces before her and produced a typewritten paper It was clear
short and to some minds convincing

She set forth that the term domestic industry did not define certain
kinds of labor but a stage of labor that all labor was originally
domestic but that most kinds had now become social as with weaving and
spinning for instance for centuries confined to the home and done by
women only now done in mills by men and women that this process
of socialization has now been taken from the home almost all the
manufacturesas of wine beer soap candles pickles and other
specialties and part of the laundry work that the other processes
of cleaning are also being socialized as by the vacuum cleaners the
professional windowwashers rug cleaners and similar professional
workers and that even in the preparation of food many kinds are now
specialized as by the baker and confectioner That in service itself
we were now able to hire by the hour or day skilled workers necessarily
above the level of the general

A growing rustle of disapproval began to make itself felt which
increased as she went on to explain how the position of the housemaid is
a survival of the ancient status of woman slavery the family with the
male head and the group of servile women

The keynote of all our difficulty in this relation is that we demand
celibacy of our domestic servants said Diantha

A murmur arose at this statement but she continued calmly

Since it is natural for women to marry the result is that our domestic
servants consist of a constantly changing series of young girls
apprentices as it were and the complicated and important duties of the
household cannot be fully mastered by such hands

The audience disapproved somewhat of this but more of what followed
She showed Mrs Porne nodding her head amusedly that so far from
being highly paid and easy labor house service was exacting and
responsible involving a high degree of skill as well as moral
character and that it was paid less than ordinary unskilled labor part
of this payment being primitive barter

Then as whispers and sporadic little spurts of angry talk increased
the clear quiet voice went on to state that this last matter the
position of a strange young girl in our homes was of itself a source of
much of the difficulty of the situation

We speak of giving them the safety and shelter of the homehere
Diantha grew solemnSo far from sharing our homes she gives up her
own and has none of ours but the poorest of our food and a cramped
lodging she has neither the freedom nor the privileges of a home and
as to shelter and safetythe domestic worker owing to her peculiarly
defenceless position furnishes a terrible percentage of the
unfortunate

A shocked silence met this statement

In England shopworkers complain of the old custom of sleeping
intheir employers furnishing them with lodging as part payment
this also is a survival of the old apprentice method With us only the
domestic servant is held to this antiquated position

Regardless of the chill displeasure about her she cheerfully pursued

Let us now consider the economic side of the question Domestic
economy is a favorite phrase As a matter of fact our method of
domestic service is inordinately wasteful Even where the wife does all
the housework without pay we still waste labor to an enormous extent
requiring one whole woman to wait upon each man If the man hires one
or more servants the wastes increase If one hundred men undertake
some common business they do not divide in two halves each man having
another man to serve himfifty productive laborers and fifty cooks
Two or three cooks could provide for the whole group to use fifty is to
waste 47 per cent of the labor

But our waste of labor is as nothing to our waste of money For say
twenty families we have twenty kitchens with all their furnishings
twenty stoves with all their fuel twenty cooks with all their wages
in cash and barter combined we pay about ten dollars a week for our
cooks200 a week to pay for the cooking for twenty families for about
a hundred persons

Three expert cooks one at 20 a week and two at 15 would save to
those twenty families 150 a week and give them better food The cost
of kitchen furnishings and fuel could be reduced by ninetenths and
beyond all that comes our incredible waste in individual purchasing
What twenty families spend on individual patronage of small retailers
could be reduced by more than half if bought by competent persons in
wholesale quantities Moreover our whole food supply would rise in
quality as well as lower in price if it was bought by experts

To what does all this lead asked Diantha pleasantly

Nobody said anything but the visible attitude of the house seemed to
say that it led straight to perdition

The solution for which so many are looking is no new scheme of any
sort and in particular it is not that oft repeated foredoomed failure
called cooperative housekeeping

At this a wave of relief spread perceptibly The irritation roused by
those preposterous figures and accusations was somewhat allayed Hope
was relit in darkened countenances

The inefficiency of a dozen tottering households is not removed by
combining them said Diantha This was of dubious import Why should
we expect a group of families to keep house expertly and economically
together when they are driven into companionship by the fact that none
of them can do it alone

Again an uncertain reception

Every family is a distinct unit the girl continued Its needs are
separate and should be met separately The separate house and garden
should belong to each family the freedom and group privacy of the
common milkman by a common baker by a common cooking and a common
cleaning establishment We are rapidly approaching an improved system of
living in which the private home will no more want a cookshop on the
premises than a blacksmiths shop or soapfactory The necessary work of
the kitchenless house will be done by the hour with skilled labor and
we shall order our food cooked instead of raw This will give to the
employees a respectable wellpaid profession with their own homes and
families and to the employers a saving of about twothirds of the
expense of living as well as an end of all our difficulties with the
servant question That is the way to elevateto enoble domestic
service It must cease to be domestic serviceand become world
service

Suddenly and quietly she sat down

Miss Eagerson was on her feet So were others

Madam President Madam President resounded from several points at
once Madam WeatherstoneMrs Thaddlerno yesthey really were both
on their feet Applause was going onirregularlysoon dropped Only
from the group in the gallery it was wholehearted and consistent

Mrs Dankshire who had been growing red and redder as the paper
advanced who had conferred in alarmed whispers with Mrs Ree and Miss
Massing who had even been seen to extend her hand to the gavel and
finger it threateningly now rose somewhat precipitately and came
forward

Order please You will please keep order You have heard thewe will
nowthe meeting is now open for discussion Mrs Thaddler And she sat
down She meant to have said Madam Weatherstone by Mrs Thaddler was
more aggressive

I wish to say said that much beaded lady in a loud voice that I
was against thisunfortunate experimentfrom the first And I trust it
will never be repeated She sat down

Two tight little dimples flickered for an instant about the corners of
Dianthas mouth

Madam Weatherstone said the President placatingly

Madam Weatherstone arose rather sulkily and looked about her An
agitated assembly met her eye buzzing universally each to each

Order said Mrs Dankshire ORDER please and rapped three times
with the gavel

I have attended many meetings in many clubs in many states said
Madam Weatherstone and have heard much that was foolish and some
things that were dangerous But I will say that never in the course of
all my experience have I heard anything so foolish and so dangerous as
this I trust that thedoubtless well meantattempt to throw light on
this subjectfrom the wrong quarterhas been a lesson to us all No
club could survive more than one such lamentable mistake And she sat
down gathering her large satin wrap about her like a retiring Caesar

Madam President broke forth Miss Eagerson I was up firstand have
been standing ever since

One moment Miss Eagerson said Mrs Dankshire superbly The Rev Dr
Eltwood

If Mrs Dankshire supposed she was still further supporting the cause of
condemnation she made a painful mistake The cloth and the fine bearing
of the young clergyman deceived her and she forgot that he was said to
be advanced and was new to the place

Will you come to the platform Dr Eltwood

Dr Eltwood came to the platform with the easy air of one to whom
platforms belonged by right

Ladies he began in tones of cordial good will both employer and
employedand gentlemenwhom I am delighted to see here today I am
grateful for the opportunity so graciously extended to mehe bowed
six feet of black broadcloth toward Mrs Dankshireby your honored
President

And I am grateful for the opportunity previously enjoyed of listening
to the most rational practical wise true and hopeful words I have
ever heard on this subject I trust there will be enough openminded
womenand menin Orchardina to make possible among us that higher
business development of a great art which has been so convincingly laid
before us This club is deserving of all thanks from the community
for extending to so many the privilege of listening to our valued
fellowcitizenMiss Bell

He bowed againto Miss Belland to Mrs Dankshire and resumed his
seat Miss Eagerson taking advantage of the dazed pause to occupy the
platform herself

Mr Eltwood is right she said Miss Bell is right This is the true
presentation of the subject by one who knows Miss Bell has
pricked our pretty bubble so thoroughly that we dont know where
were standingbut she knows Housework is a businesslike any other
businessIve always said so and its got to be done in a business
way Now I for one but Miss Eagerson was rapped down by the
Presidential gavel as Mrs Thaddler portentous and severe stalked
forward

It is not my habit to make public speeches she began nor my desire
but this is a time when prompt and decisive action needs to be taken
This Club cannot afford to countenance any such farrago of mischievous
nonsense as we have heard today I move you Madam President that
a resolution of condemnation be passed at once and the meeting then
dismissed

She stalked back again while Mrs Marrow of Boston in clear cold
tones seconded the motion

But another voice was heardfor the first time in that assemblyMrs
Weatherstone the pretty delicate widower daughterinlaw of Madam
Weatherstone was on her feet with Madam President I wish to speak to
this motion

Wont you come to the platform Mrs Weatherstone asked Mrs
Dankshire graciously and the little lady came visibly trembling but
holding her head high

All sat silent all expectedwhat was not forthcoming

I wish to protest as a member of the Club and as a woman against the
gross discourtesy which has been offered to the guest and speaker of the
day In answer to our invitation Miss Bell has given us a scholarly and
interesting paper and I move that we extend her a vote of thanks

I second the motion came from all quarters

There is another motion before the house from others

Cries of Madam President arose everywhere many speakers were on their
feet Mrs Dankshire tapped frantically with the little gavel but Miss
Eagerson by sheer vocal power took and held the floor

I move that we take a vote on this question she cried in piercing
tones Let every woman who knows enough to appreciate Miss Bells
paperand has any sense of decencystand up

Quite a large proportion of the audience stood upvery informally
Those who did not did not mean to acknowledge lack of intelligence and
sense of decency but to express emphatic disapproval of Miss Eagerson
Miss Bell and their views

I move you Madam President cried Mrs Thaddler at the top of her
voice that every member who is guilty of such grossly unparlimentary
conduct be hereby dropped from this Club

We hereby resign cried Miss Eagerson _We_ drop _you_ Well have
a New Womans Club in Orchardina with some warmth in its heart and some
brains in its headeven if it hasnt as much money in its pocket

Amid stern rappings hissings cries of Orderorder and frantic
Motions to adjourn the meeting broke up the club elements dissolving
and reforming into two bodies as by some swift chemical reaction

Great was the rejoicing of the daily press some amusement was felt
though courteously suppressed by the men present and by many not
present when they heard of it

Some ladies were so shocked and grieved as to withdraw from clublife
altogether Others in stern dignity upheld the shaken standards of
Home and Culture while the most conspicuous outcome of it all was the
immediate formation of the New Womans Club of Orchardina




CHAPTER VIII


Behind the straight purple backs and smooth purple legs on the box
before them Madam Weatherstone and Mrs Weatherstone rolled home
silently a silence of thunderous portent Another purple person opened
the door for them and when Madam Weatherstone said We will have tea
on the terrace it was brought them by a fourth

I was astonished at your attitude Viva began the old lady at
length Of course it was Mrs Dankshires fault in the first place but
to encourage thatoutrageous person How could you do it

Young Mrs Weatherstone emptied her exquisite cup and set it down

A sudden access of courage I suppose she said I was astonished at
myself

I wholly disagree with you replied her motherinlaw Never in my
life have I heard such nonsense Talk like that would be dangerous if
it were not absurd It would destroy the home It would strike at the
roots of the family

Viva eyed her quietly trying to bear in mind the weight of a tradition
the habits of a lifetime the effect of long years of uninterrupted
worship of household gods

It doesnt seem so to me she said slowly I was much interested and
impressed She is evidently a young woman of knowledge and experience
and put her case well It has quite waked me up

It has quite upset you was the reply Youll be ill after this I am
sure Hadnt you better go and lie down now Ill have some dinner sent
to you

Thank you said Viva rising and walking to the edge of the broad
terrace You are very kind No I do not wish to lie down I havent
felt so thoroughly awake in she drew a pink cluster of oleander
against her cheek and thought a momentin several years There was a
new look about her certainly

Nervous excitement her motherinlaw replied Youre not like
yourself at all tonight Youll certainly be ill tomorrow

Viva turned at this and again astonished the old lady by serenely
kissing her Not at all she said gaily Im going to be well
tomorrow You will see

She went to her room drew a chair to the wide west window with the far
off view and sat herself down to think Dianthas assured poise
her clear reasoning her courage her common sense and something of
tenderness and consecration she discerned also had touched deep chords
in this womans nature It was like the sound of far doors opening
windows thrown up the jingle of bridles and clatter of hoofs keen
bugle notes A sense of hope of power of new enthusiasm rose in her

Orchardina Society eagerly observing young Mrs Weatherstone from her
first appearance had always classified her as delicate Beside the
firm features and high color of the matroninoffice this pale quiet
slender woman looked like a meek and transient visitor But her white
forehead was broad under its softhanging eaves of hair and her chin
though lacking in prognathous prominence or bulldog breadth had a
certain depth which gave hope to the physiognomist

She was strangely roused and stirred by the afternoons events Im
like that man in Phantastes she thought contemptuously who stayed
so long in that dungeon because it didnt occur to him to open the door
Why dont I she rose and walked slowly up and down her hands behind
her I will she said at last

Then she dressed for dinner revolving in her mind certain suspicions
long suppressed but now flaming out in clear conviction in the light
of Dianthas words Sleeping in indeed she murmured to herself And
nobody doing anything

She looked herself in the eye in the long mirror Her gown was an
impressive one her hair coiled high a gold band ringed it like a
crown A clear red lit her checks

She rang Little Ilda the newest maid appeared gazing at her in shy
admiration Mrs Weatherstone looked at her with new eyes Have you
been here long she asked What is your name

No maam said the childshe was scarce more Only a week and two
days My name is Ilda

Who engaged you

Mrs Halsey maam

Ah said Mrs Weatherstone musing to herself and I engaged Mrs
Halsey Do you like it here she continued kindly

Oh yes maam said Ilda That is she stopped blushed and
continued bravely I like to work for you maam

Thank you Ilda Will you ask Mrs Halsey to come to meat once
please

Ilda went more impressed than ever with the desirability of her new
place and mistress

As she was about to pass the door of Mr Matthew Weatherstone that
young gentleman stepped out and intercepted her Whither away so fast
my dear he amiably inquired

Please let one pass sir Im on an errand Please sir

You must give me a kiss first said heand since there seemed no
escape and she was in haste she submitted He took sixand she ran
away half crying

Mrs Halsey little accustomed to take orders from her real mistress
and resting comfortably in her room had half a mind to send an excuse

Im not dressed she said to the maid

Well she is replied Ilda dressed splendid She said at once
please

A pretty time o day said the housekeeper with some asperity hastily
buttoning her gown and she presently appeared somewhat heated before
Mrs Weatherstone

That lady was sitting cool and gracious her long ivory papercutter
between the pages of a new magazine

In how short a time could you pack Mrs Halsey she inquired

Pack maam Im not accustomed to doing packing Ill send one of the
maids Is it your things maam

No said Mrs Weatherstone It is yours I refer to I wish you to
pack your things and leave the housein an hour One of the maids can
help you if necessary Anything you cannot take can be sent after you
Here is a check for the following months wages

Mrs Halsey was nearly a head taller than her employer a stout showy
woman handsome enough redlipped and with a moist and crafty eye
This was so sudden a misadventure that she forgot her usual caution
Youve no right to turn me off in a minute like this she burst forth
Ill leave it to Madam Weatherstone

If you will look at the terms on which I engaged you Mrs Halsey you
will find that a months warning or a months wages was specified
Here are the wagesas to the warning that has been given for some
months past

By whom Maam

By yourself Mrs HalseyI think you understand me Oscar will take
your things as soon as they are ready

Mrs Halsey met her steady eye a momentsaw more than she cared to
faceand left the room

She took care however to carry some letters to Madam Weatherstone and
meekly announced her discharge also by some coincidence she met Mr
Matthew in the hall upstairs and weepingly confided her grievance to
him meeting immediate consolation both sentimental and practical

When hurried servants were sent to find their young mistress they
reported that she must have gone out and in truth she had out on her
own roof where she sat quite still though shivering a little now and
then from the new excitement until dinner time

This meal in the mind of Madam Weatherstone was the crowning factor
of daily life and on state occasions of social life In her cosmogony
the central sun was a round mahogany table all other details of
housekeeping revolved about it in varying orbits To serve an endless
series of dignified delicious meals notably dinners was in her eyes
the chief end of woman the most high purpose of the home

Therefore though angry and astounded she appeared promptly when the
meal was announced and when her daughterinlaw serene and royally
attired took her place as usual no emotion was allowed to appear
before the purple footman who attended

I understood you were out Viva she said politely

I was replied Viva with equal decorum It is charming outside at
this time in the eveningdont you think so

Young Matthew was gloomy and irritable throughout the length and breadth
of the meal and when they were left with their coffee in the drawing
room he broke out Whats this I hear about Mrs Halsey being fired
without notice

That is what I wish to know Viva said the grandmother The poor
woman is greatly distressed Is there not some mistake

Its a damn shame said Matthew

The younger lady glanced from one to the other and wondered to see how
little she minded it The door was there all the time she thought
to herself as she looked her stepson in the eye and said Hardly
drawingroom language Matthew Your grandmother is present

He stared at her in dumb amazement so she went on No there is no
mistake at all I discharged Mrs Halsey about an hour before dinner
The terms of the engagement were a months warning or a months wages I
gave her the wages

But but Madam Weatherstone was genuinely confused by this sudden
inexplicable yet perfectly polite piece of what she still felt to be in
the nature of interference and presumption I have had no fault to
find with her

I have you see said her daughterinlaw smiling I found her
unsatisfactory and shall replace her with something better presently
How about a little music Matthew Wont you start the victrolla

Matthew wouldnt He was going out went out with the word Madam
Weatherstone didnt wish to hear ithad a headachemust go to her
roomwent to her room forthwith There was a tension in the atmosphere
that would have wrung tears from Viva Weatherstone a week ago yes
twentyfour hours ago

As it was she rose to her feet stretching herself to her full height
and walked the length of the great empty room She even laughed a
little Its open said she and ordered the car While waiting for it
she chatted with Mrs Porne awhile over the allconvenient telephone



Diantha sat at her window watching the big soft brilliant moon behind
the eucalyptus trees After the close of the strenuous meeting she had
withdrawn from the crowd of excited women anxious to shake her hand
and engage her on the spot had asked time to consider a number of good
opportunities offered and had survived the cold and angry glances of
the now smaller but far more united Home and Culture Club She declined
to talk to the reporters and took refuge first in an open car
This proved very unsatisfactory owing to her sudden prominence Two
persistent newspaper men swung themselves upon the car also and insisted
on addressing her

Excuse me gentlemen she said I am not acquainted with you

They eagerly produced their cardsand said they were newspaper men

I see said Diantha But you are still men And gentlemen I suppose
I am a woman and I do not wish to talk with you

Miss Bell Declines to Be Interviewed wrote the reporters and
spent themselves on her personal appearance being favorably impressed
thereby

But Miss Bell got off at the next corner and took a short cut to the
house where she had rented a room Reporters were waiting there two
being women

Diantha politely but firmly declined to see them and started for the
stairs but they merely stood in front of her and asked questions The
girls blood surged to her cheeks she smiled grimly kept absolute
silence brushed through them and went swiftly to her room locking the
door after her

The reporters described her appearanceunfavorably this time and
they described the housealso unfavorably They said that A group of
adoringeyed young men stood about the doorway as the flushed heroine of
the afternoon made her brusque entrance These adorers consisted of
the landladys Johnny aged thirteen and two satellites of his still
younger They _did_ look at Diantha admiringly and she _was_ a little
hurried in her entrancetruth must be maintained

Too irritated and tired to go out for dinner she ate an orange or two
lay down awhile and then eased her mind by writing a long letter to
Ross and telling him all about it That is she told him most of it
all the pleasant things all the funny things leaving out about the
reporters because she was too angry to be just she told herself She
wrote and wrote becoming peaceful as the quiet moments passed and
a sense grew upon her of the strong lasting love that was waiting so
patiently

Dearest her swift pen flew along I really feel much encouraged
An impression has been made One or two men spoke to me afterward the
young minister who said such nice things and one older man who looked
prosperous and reliable When you begin any such business as you have
outlined you may count on me Miss Bell he said and gave me his
card Hes a lawyerP L Wiscomb nice man I should think Another
big sheepishlooking man said And me Miss Bell His name is
Thaddler his wife is very disagreeable Some of the women are favorably
impressed but the oldfashioned kindmy If hate killed men Brother
Lawrencebut it dont

She wrote herself into a good humor and dwelt at considerable length
on the pleasant episode of the minister and young Mrs Weatherstones
remarks I liked her she wrote Shes a nice womaneven if she is
rich

There was a knock at her door Lady to see you Miss

I cannot see anyone said Diantha you must excuse me

Beg pardon Miss but its not a reporter its The landlady
stretched her lean neck around the door edge and whispered hoarsely
Its young Mrs Weatherstone

Diantha rose to her feet a little bewildered Ill be right down she
said But a voice broke in from the hall I beg your pardon Miss Bell
but I took the liberty of coming up may I come in

She came in and the landlady perforce went out Mrs Weatherstone held
Dianthas hand warmly and looked into her eyes I was a schoolmate of
Ellen Porne she told the girl We are dear friends still and so I
feel that I know you better than you think You have done beautiful work
for Mrs Porne now I want you to do to it for me I need you

Wont you sit down said Diantha

You too said Mrs Weatherstone Now I want you to come to meright
away You have done me so much good already I was just a New England
bred school teacher myself at first so were even that far Then you
took a step upand I took a step down

Diantha was a little slow in understanding the quick fervor of this new
friend a trifle suspicious even being a cautious soul and somewhat
overstrung perhaps Her visitor brighteyed and eager went on I
gave up school teaching and married a fortune You have given it up to
do a more needed work I think you are wonderful Now I know this
seems queer to you but I want to tell you about it I feel sure youll
understand At home Madam Weatherstone has had everything in charge for
years and years and Ive been too lazy or too weak or too indifferent
to do anything I didnt care somehow All the machinery of living
and no _living_no good of it all Yet there didnt seem to be
anything else to do Now you have waked me all upyour paper this
afternoonwhat Mr Eltwood saidthe way those poor dull blind women
took it And yet I was just as dull and blind myself Well I begin to
see things now I cant tell you all at once what a difference it has
made but I have a very definite proposition to make to you Will you
come and be my housekeeper nowright awayat a hundred dollars a
month

Diantha opened her eyes wide and looked at the eager lady as if she
suspected her nervous balance

The other one got a thousand a yearyou are worth more Now dont
decline please Let me tell you about it I can see that you have plans
ahead for this business but it cant hurt you much to put them off
six months say Meantime you could be practicing Our place at Santa
Ulrica is almost as big as this one there are lots of servants and
a great weary maze of accounts to be kept and it wouldnt be bad
practice for younow would it

Dianthas troubled eyes lit up Noyou are right there she said If
I could do it

Youll have to do just that sort of thing when you are running your
business wont you her visitor went on And the summers not a good
time to start a thing like that is it

Diantha meditated No I wasnt going to I was going to start
somewheretake a cottage a dozen girls or soand furnish labor by the
day to the other cottages

Well you might be able to run that on the side said Mrs
Weatherstone And you could train my girls get in new ones if you
like it doesnt seem to me it would conflict But to speak to you quite
frankly Miss Bell I want you in the house for my own sake You do me
good

They discussed the matter for some time Diantha objecting mainly to
the suddenness of it all Im a slow thinker she said and this is
soso attractive that Im suspicious of it I had the other thing all
plannedthe girls practically engaged

Where were you thinking of going asked Mrs Weatherstone

To Santa Ulrica

Exactly Well you shall have your cottage and our girls and give them
part time Orhow many have you arranged with

Only six have made definite engagements yet

What kind

Two laundresses a cook and three second maids all good ones

Excellent Now I tell you what to do I will engage all those girls
Im making a change at the house for various reasons You bring them to
me as soon as you like but you I want at once I wish youd come home
with me tonight Why dont you

Dianthas scanty baggage was all in sight She looked around for an
excuse Mrs Weatherstone stood up laughing

Put the new address in the letter she said mischievously and come
along



And the purple chauffeur his disapproving back ineffectual in the
darkness rolled them home




CHAPTER IX SLEEPING IN


 Men have marched in armies fleets have borne them
 Left their homes new countries to subdue
 Young men seeking fortune wide have wandered
 We have something new

 Armies of young maidens cross our oceans
 Leave their mothers love their fathers care
 Maidens young and helpless widely wander
 Burdens new to bear

 Strange the land and language laws and customs
 Ignorant and all alone they come
 Maidens young and helpless serving strangers
 Thus we keep the Home

 When on earth was safety for young maidens
 Far from mothers love and fathers care
 We preserve The Home and call it sacred
 Burdens new they bear


The sun had gone down on Madam Weatherstones wrath and risen to find
it unabated With condensed disapprobation written on every wellcut
feature she came to the coldly gleaming breakfast table

That Mrs Halsey was undoubtedly gone she had to admit yet so far
failed to find the exact words of reproof for a woman of independent
means discharging her own housekeeper when it pleased her

Young Mathew unexpectedly appeared at breakfast perhaps in anticipation
of a sort of Roman holiday in which his usually late and apologetic
stepmother would furnish the amusement They were both surprised to find
her there before them looking uncommonly fresh in crisp sheer white
with deeptoned violets in her belt

She ate with every appearance of enjoyment chatting amiably about the
lovely morningthe flowers the garden and the gardeners her efforts
ill seconded however

Shall I attend to the orders this morning asked Madam Weatherstone
with an air of noble patience

O no thank you replied Viva I have engaged a new housekeeper

A new housekeeper When The old lady was shaken by this inconceivable
promptness

Last night said her daughterinlaw looking calmly across the table
her color rising a little

And when is she coming if I may ask

She has come I have been with her an hour already this morning

Young Mathew smiled This was amusing though not what he had expected
How extremely alert and businesslike he said lazily Its becoming
to youto get up early

You cant have got much of a personat a minutes notice said his
grandmother Or perhaps you have been planning this for some time

No said Viva I have wanted to get rid of Mrs Halsey for some time
but the new one I found yesterday

Whats her name inquired Mathew

BellMiss Diantha Bell she answered looking as calm as if
announcing the day of the week but inwardly dreading the result
somewhat Like most of such terrors it was overestimated

There was a little pauserather an intense little pause and
thenIsnt that the girl who set em all by the ears yesterday
asked the young man pointing to the morning paper They say shes a
goodlooker

Madam Weatherstone rose from the table in some agitation I must say
I am very sorry Viva that you should have been soprecipitate This
young woman cannot be competent to manage a house like thisto say
nothing of her scandalous ideas Mrs Halsey wasto my mindperfectly
satisfactory I shall miss her very much She swept out with an
unanswerable air

So shall I muttered Mat under his breath as he strolled after her
unless the new ones equally amiable

Viva Weatherstone watched them go and stood awhile looking after the
wellbuilt welldressed wellmannered but far from wellbehaved young
man

I dont _know_ she said to herself but I do feelthinkimaginea
good deal Im sure I hope not Anywayits new life to have that girl
in the house

That girl had undertaken what she described to Ross as a large ordera
very large order

Its the hardest thing I ever undertook she wrote him but I think
I can do it and it will be a tremendous help Mrs Weatherstones a
bricka perfect brick She seems to have been very unhappyfor ever
so longand to have submitted to her domineering old motherinlaw just
because she didnt care enough to resist Now shes got waked up all
of a suddenshe says it was my paper at the clubmore likely my awful
example I think and she fired her old housekeeperI dont know what
forand rushed me in

So here I am The salary is good the work is excellent training and I
guess I can hold the place But the old lady is a terror and the young
manhow you would despise that Johnny

The home letters she now received were rather amusing Ross sternly
patient saw little difference in her position I hope you will enjoy
your new work he wrote but personally I should prefer that you did
notso you might give it up and come home sooner I miss you as you
can well imagine Even when you were here life was hard enoughbut
now

I had a half offer for the store the other day but it fell through If
I could sell that incubus and put the money into a ranchfruit hens
anythingthen we could all live on it more cheaply I think and I
could find time for some research work I have in mind You remember that
guineapig experiment I want so to try

Diantha remembered and smiled sadly She was not much interested in
guineapigs and their potential capacities but she was interested in
her lover and his happiness Ranch she said thoughtfully thats not
a bad idea

Her mother wrote the same patient loving letters perfunctorily hopeful
Her father wrote noneA womans businessthis letterwritin he
always held and George after one scornful upbraiding had washed his
hands of her with some sense of relief He didnt like to write letters
either

But Susie kept up a lively correspondence She was attached to her
sister as to all her immediate relatives and surroundings and while
she utterly disapproved of Dianthas undertaking a sense of sisterly
duty to say nothing of affection prompted her to many letters It did
not however always make these agreeable reading

Mothers pretty well and the girl shes got now does nicelythat
first one turned out to be a failure Fathers as cranky as ever We are
all well here and the baby this was a brand new baby Diantha had not
seen is just a Darling You ought to be here you unnatural Aunt
Gerald doesnt ever speak of youbut I do just the same You hear from
the Wardens of course Mrs Wardens got neuralgia or something keeps
them all busy They are much excited over this new place of yoursyou
ought to hear them go on It appears that Madam Weatherstone is a
connection of theirsone of the F F Vs I guess and they think
shes something wonderful And to have _you_ working _there_well
you can just see how theyd feel and I dont blame them Its no
use arguing with youbut I should think youd have enough of this
disgraceful foolishness by this time and come home

Diantha tried to be very philosophic over her home letters but they
were far from stimulating Its no use arguing with poor Susie she
decided Susie thinks the sun rises and sets between kitchen nursery
and parlor

Mother cant see the good of it yet but she will laterMothers all
right

Im awfully sorry the Wardens feel soand make Ross unhappybut of
course I knew they would It cant be helped Its just a question of
time and work

And she went to work



Mrs Porne called on her friend most promptly with a natural eagerness
and curiosity

How does it work Do you like her as much as you thought Do tell me
about it Viva You look like another woman already

I certainly feel like one Viva answered Ive seen slaves in
housework and Ive seen what we fondly call Queens in housework but
I never saw brains in it before

Mrs Porne sighed Isnt it just wonderfulthe way she does things
Dear me We do miss her She trained that Swede for usand she does
pretty wellbut not like Miss Bell I wish there were a hundred of
her

If there were a hundred thousand she wouldnt go round answered Mrs
Weatherstone How selfish we are _That_ is the kind of woman we all
want in our homesand fuss because we cant have them

Edgar says he quite agrees with her views Mrs Porne went on
Skilled labor by the dayfood sent in He says if she cooked it
he wouldnt care if it came all the way from Alaska She certainly can
cook I wish shed set up her businessthe sooner the better

Mrs Weatherstone nodded her head firmly She will Shes planning
This was really an interruptionher coming here but I think it will
be a helpshes not had experience in large management before but
she takes hold splendidly Shes found a dozen leaks in our household
already

Mrs Thaddlers simply furious I hear said the visitor Mrs Ree
was in this morning and told me all about it Poor Mrs Ree The home is
church and state to her that paper of Miss Bells she regards as simple
blasphemy

They both laughed as that stormy meeting rose before them

I was so proud of you Viva standing up for her as you did How did
you ever dare

Why I got my courage from the girl herself She wassuperb Talk
of blasphemy Why Ive committed _lese majeste_ and regicide and the
Unpardonable Sin since that meeting And she told her friend of her
brief passage at arms with Mrs Halsey I never liked the woman she
continued and some of the things Miss Bell said set me thinking I
dont believe we half know whats going on in our houses

Well Mrs Thaddlers so outraged by this scandalous attack upon
the sanctities of the home that shes going about saying all sorts of
things about Miss Bell O lookI do believe thats her car

Even as they spoke a toneless voice announced Mr and Mrs Thaddler
and Madam Weatherstone presently appeared to greet these visitors

I think you are trying a dangerous experiment said Mrs Thaddler to
her young hostess A very dangerous experiment Bringing that young
iconoclast into your home

Mr Thaddler stout and sulky sat as far away as he could and talked
to Mrs Porne Id like to try that same experiment myself said he to
her You tried it some time I understand

Indeed we didand would still if we had the chance she replied We
think her a very exceptional young woman

Mr Thaddler chuckled She is that he agreed Gad How she did set
things humming Theyre humming yetat our house

He glanced rather rancorously at his wife and Mrs Porne wished as she
often had before that Mr Thaddler wore more clothing over his domestic
afflictions

Scandalous Mrs Thaddler was saying to Madam Weatherstone
Simply scandalous Never in my life did I hear such absurdsuch
outrageouscharges against the sanctities of the home

There you have it said Mr Thaddler under his breath Sanctity of
the fiddlesticks There was a lot of truth in what that girl said
Then he looked rather sheepish and flushed a littlewhich was needless
easing his collar with a fat finger

Madam Weatherstone and Mrs Thaddler were at one on this subject but
found it hard to agree even so no love being lost between them and
the former gave evidence of more satisfaction than distress at this
dangerous experiment in the house of her friends Viva sat silent but
with a look of watchful intelligence that delighted Mrs Porne

It has done her good already she said to herself Bless that girl

Mr Thaddler went home disappointed in the real object of his callhe
had hoped to see the Dangerous Experiment again But his wife was well
pleased

They will rue it she announced Madam Weatherstone is ashamed of her
daughterinlawI can see that _She_ looks cool enough I dont know
whats got into her

Some of that young womans good cooking her husband suggested

That young woman is not there as cook she replied tartly What she
_is_ there for we shall see later Mark my words

Mr Thaddler chuckled softly Ill mark em he said

Diantha had her hands full Needless to say her sudden entrance was
resented by the corps of servants accustomed to the old regime She had
the keys she explored studied inventoried examined the accounts
worked out careful tables and estimates I wish Mother were here
she said to herself Shes a regular genius for accounts I _can_ do
itbut its no joke

She brought the results to her employer at the end of the week This
is tentative she said and Ive allowed margins because Im new to a
business of this size But heres what this house ought to cost youat
the outside and heres what it does cost you now

Mrs Weatherstone was impressed Arent you a littlespectacular she
suggested

Diantha went over it carefully the number of rooms the number of
servants the hours of labor the amount of food and other supplies
required

This is only preparatory of course she said Ill have to check it
off each month If I may do the ordering and keep all the accounts I can
show you exactly in a month or two at most

How about the servants asked Mrs Weatherstone

There was much to say here questions of competence of impertinence of
personal excellence with incompatibility of temper Diantha was given
a free hand with full liberty to experiment and met the opportunity
with her usual energy

She soon discharged the unsatisfactory ones and substituted the girls
she had selected for her summers experiment gradually adding others
till the household was fairly harmonious and far more efficient and
economical A few changes were made among the men also

By the time the family moved down to Santa Ulrica there was quite a new
spirit in the household Mrs Weatherstone fully approved of the Girls
Club Diantha had started at Mrs Pornes and it went on merrily in the
larger quarters of the great cottage on the cliff

Im very glad I came to you Mrs Weatherstone said the girl You
were quite right about the experience I did need itand Im getting
it

She was getting some of which she made no mention

As she won and held the confidence of her subordinates and the growing
list of club members she learned their personal stories what had
befallen them in other families and what they liked and disliked in
their present places

The men are not so bad explained Catharine Kelly at a club meeting
meaning the men servants they respect an honest girl if she respects
herself but its the young mastersand sometimes the old ones

Its all nonsense protested Mrs James widowed cook of long
standing Ive worked out for twentyfive years and I never met no
such goings on

Little Ilda looked at Mrs James severe face and giggled

Ive heard of it said Molly Connors Ive a cousin thats workin
in New York and shes had to leave two good places on account of their
misbehavin theirselves Shes a fine girl but too goodlookin

Diantha studied types questioned them drew them out adjusted facts
to theories and theories to facts She found the weakness of the
whole position to lie in the utter ignorance and helplessness of the
individual servant If they were only organized she thoughtand
knew their own powerWell theres plenty of time

As her acquaintance increased and as Mrs Weatherstones interest in
her plans increased also she started the small summer experiment
she had planned for furnishing labor by the day Mrs James was an
excellent cook though most unpleasant to work with She was quite able
to see that getting up frequent lunches at three dollars and dinners
at five dollars made a better income than ten dollars a week even with
several days unoccupied

A group of younger women under Dianthas sympathetic encouragement
agreed to take a small cottage together with Mrs James as a species
of chaperone and to go out in twos and threes as chambermaids and
waitresses at 25 cents an hour Two of them could set in perfect order
one of the small beach cottage in an hours time and the occupants
already crowded for room were quite willing to pay a little more in
cash not to have a servant around Most of them took their meals out
in any case

It was a modest attempt elastic and easily alterable and based on the
special conditions of a shore resort Mrs Weatherstones known interest
gave it social backing and many ladies who heartily disapproved of
Dianthas theories found themselves quite willing to profit by this very
practical local solution of the servant question

The club girls became very popular Across the deep hot sand they
ploughed and clattered along the warping boardwalks in merry pairs and
groups finding the work far more varied and amusing than the endless
repetition in one household They had pleasant evenings too with plenty
of callers albeit somewhat checked and chilled by rigorous Mrs James

It is both foolish and wicked said Madam Weatherstone to her
daughterinlaw Exposing a group of silly girls to such danger and
temptations I understand there is singing and laughing going on at that
house until halfpast ten at night

Yes there is Viva admitted Mrs James insists that they shall
all be in bed at elevenwhich is very wise Im glad they have good
timestheres safety in numbers you know

There will be a scandal in this community before long said the old
lady solemnly And it grieves me to think that this household will be
responsible for it

Diantha heard all this from the linen room while Madam Weatherstone
buttonholed her daughterinlaw in the hall and in truth the old lady
meant that she should hear what she said

Shes right Im afraid said Diantha to herselfthere will be a
scandal if Im not mighty careful and this household will be responsible
for it

Even as she spoke she caught Ildas childish giggle in the lower hall
and looking over the railing saw her airily dusting the big Chinese
vases and coquetting with young Mr Mathew

Later on Diantha tried seriously to rouse her conscience and her common
sense Dont you see child that it cant do you anything but harm
You cant carry on with a man like that as you can with one of your own
friends He is not to be trusted One nice girl I had here simply left
the placehe annoyed her so

Ilda was a little sulky She had been quite a queen in the small
Norwegian village she was born in Young men were young menand
they might evenperhaps This severe young housekeeper didnt know
everything Maybe she was jealous

So Ilda was rather unconvinced though apparently submissive and
Diantha kept a careful eye upon her She saw to it that Ildas room had
a bolt as well as key in the door and kept the room next to it empty
frequently using it herself unknown to anyone I hate to turn the
child off she said to herself conscientiously revolving the matter
She isnt doing a thing more than most girls doshes only a little
fool And hes not doing anything I can complain ofyet

But she worried over it a good deal and Mrs Weatherstone noticed it

Doesnt your pet club house go well Miss Bell You seem troubled
about something

I am Diantha admitted I believe Ill have to tell you about itbut
I hate to Perhaps if youll come and look I shant have to say much

She led her to a window that looked on the garden the rich vivid
flowercrowded garden of Southern California by the sea Little Ilda
in a fresh black frock and snowy frilly cap and apron ran out to get a
rose and while she sniffed and dallied they saw Mr Mathew saunter out
and join her

The girl was not as severe with him as she ought to have beenthat was
evident but it was also evident that she was frightened and furious
when he suddenly held her fast and kissed her with much satisfaction As
soon as her arms were free she gave him a slap that sounded smartly even
at that distance and ran crying into the house

Shes foolish I admit said Dianthabut she doesnt realize her
danger at all Ive tried to make her And now Im more worried than
ever It seems rather hard to discharge hershe needs care

Ill speak to that young man myself said Mrs Weatherstone Ill
speak to his grandmother too

Owould you urged Diantha She wouldnt believe anything except
that the girl led him onyou know that But I have an idea that
we could convince herif youre willing to do something rather
melodramaticand I think wed better do it tonight

Whats that asked her employer and Diantha explained It was
melodramatic but promised to be extremely convincing

Do you think hed dare under my roof hotly demanded Madam
Weatherstone

Im very much afraid it wouldnt be the first time Diantha
reluctantly assured her Its no use being horrified But if we could
only make _sure_

If we could only make his grandmother sure cried Madam Weatherstone
That would save me a deal of trouble and misunderstanding See hereI
think I can manage itwhat makes you think its tonight

I cant be absolutely certain Diantha explained and told her the
reasons she had

It does look so her employer admitted Well try it at any rate

Urging her motherinlaws presence on the ground of needing her
experienced advice Mrs Weatherstone brought the august lady to the
room next to Ildas late that evening the housekeeper in attendance

We mustnt wake the servants she said in an elaborate whisper
They need sleep poor things But I want to consult you about these
communicating doors and the locksmith is coming in the morningyou see
this opens from this side She turned the oiled key softly in the lock
Now Miss Bell thinks they ought to be left soso that the girls can
visit one another if they likewhat do you think

I think you are absurd to bring me to the top floor at this time
of night for a thing like this said the old lady They should be
permanently locked to my mind Theres no question about it

Viva still in low tones discussed this point further introduced the
subject of wallpaper or hard finish pointed out from the window a tall
eucalyptus which she thought needed heading did what she could to keep
her motherinlaw on the spot and presently her efforts were rewarded

A sound of muffled speech came from the next rooma mans voice dimly
heard Madam Weatherstone raised her head like a warhorse

Whats this Whats this she said in a fierce whisper

Viva laid a hand on her arm Sh said she Let us make sure and she
softly unlatched the door

A brilliant moon flooded the small chamber They could see little Ilda
huddled in the bedclothes staring at her door from which the key had
fallen Another key was being insertedturnedbut the bolt held

Come and open it young lady said a careful voice outside

Go away Go away begged the girl low and breathlessly Oh how _can_
you Go away quick

Indeed I wont said the voice You come and open it

Go away she cried in a soft but frantic voice IIll scream

Scream away he answered Ill just say I came up to see what the
screamings about thats all You open the doorif you dont want
anybody to know Im here I wont hurt you anyI just want to talk to
you a minute

Madam Weatherstone was speechless with horror her daughterinlaw
listened with set lips Diantha looked from one to the other and at the
frightened child before them who was now close to the terrible door

O please_please_ go away she cried in desperation O what shall
I do What shall I do

You cant do anything he answered cheerfully And Im coming in
anyhow Youd better keep still about this for your own sake Stand from
under Madam Weatherstone marched into the room Ilda with a little
cry fled out of it to Diantha

There was a jump a scramble two knuckly hands appeared a long leg was
put through the transom two legs wildly wriggling a descending body
and there stood before them flushed dishevelled his coat up to his
earsMat Weatherstone

He did not notice the stern rigidity of the figure which stood between
him and the moonlight but clasped it warmly to his heartNow Ive
got you Ducky cried he pressing all too affectionate kisses upon the
face of his grandmother

Young Mrs Weatherstone turned on the light

It was an embarrassing position for the gentleman

He had expected to find a helpless cowering girl afraid to cry out
because her case would be lost if she did begging piteously that he
would leave her wholly at his mercy

What he did find was so inexplicable as to reduce him to gibbering
astonishment There stood his imposing grandmother so overwhelmed
with amazement that her trenchant sentences failed her completely his
stepmother wearing an expression that almost suggested delight in his
discomfiture and Diantha as grim as Rhadamanthus

Poor little Ilda burst into wild sobs and choking explanations clinging
to Dianthas hand If Id only listened to you she said You told me
he was bad I never thought hed do such an awful thing

Young Mathew fumbled at the door He had locked it outside in his
efforts with the passkey He was red red to his earsvery red but
there was no escape He faced themthere was no good in facing the
door

They all stood aside and let him passa wordless gauntlet

Diantha took the weeping Ilda to her room for the night Madam
Weatherstone and Mrs Weatherstone went down together

She must have encouraged him the older lady finally burst forth

She did not encourage him to enter her room as you saw and heard
said Viva with repressed intensity

Hes only a boy said his grandmother

She is only a child a helpless child a foreigner away from home
untaught unprotected Viva answered swiftly adding with quiet
sarcasmSave for the shelter of the home

They parted in silence




CHAPTER X UNION HOUSE


 We are weak said the Sticks and men broke them
 We are weak said the Threads and were torn
 Till new thoughts came and they spoke them
 Till the Fagot and the Rope were born

 For the Fagot men find is resistant
 And they anchor on the Ropes taut length
 Even grasshoppers combined
 Are a force the farmers find
 In union there is strength


Ross Warden endured his grocery business strove with it toiled at it
concentrated his scientific mind on alien tasks of financial calculation
and practical psychology but he liked it no better He had no interest
in business no desire to make money no skill in salesmanship

But there were five mouths at home sweet affectionate feminine mouths
no doubt but requiring food Also two in the kitchen wider and
requiring more food And there were five backs at home to be covered
to use the absurd metaphoras if all one needed for clothing was a
four foot patch The amount and quality of the covering was an unceasing
surprise to Ross and he did not do justice to the fact that his
womenfolk really saved a good deal by doing their own sewing

In his heart he longed always to be free of the whole hated load of
tradesmanship Continually his thoughts went back to the hope of selling
out the business and buying a ranch

I could make it keep us anyhow he would plan to himself and I
could get at that guinea pig idea Or maybe hens would do He had
a theory of his own or a personal test of his own rather which he
wished to apply to a well known theory It would take some years to
work it out and a great many fine pigs and be of no possible value
financially Ill do it sometime he always concluded which was cold
comfort

His real grief at losing the companionship of the girl he loved was
made more bitter by a total lack of sympathy with her aims even if she
achieved themin which he had no confidence He had no power to change
his course and tried not to be unpleasant about it but he had to
express his feelings now and then

Are you coming back to me he wrote How con you bear to give so much
pain to everyone who loves you Is your wonderful salary worth more to
you than being here with your motherwith me How can you say you
love meand ruin both our lives like this I cannot come to see youI
_would_ not come to see youcalling at the back door Finding the girl
I love in a cap and apron Can you not see it is wrong utterly wrong
all this mad escapade of yours Suppose you do make a thousand dollars a
yearI shall never touch your moneyyou know that I cannot even offer
you a home except with my family and I know how you feel about that I
do not blame you

But I am as stubborn as you are dear girl I will not live on my
wifes moneyyou will not live in my mothers houseand we are
drifting apart It is not that I care less for you dear or at all for
anyone else but this is slow deaththats all

Mrs Warden wrote now and then and expatiated on the sufferings of her
son and his failing strength under the unnatural strain till Diantha
grew to dread her letters more than any pain she knew Fortunately they
came seldom

Her own family was much impressed by the thousand dollars and found
the occupation of housekeeper a long way more tolerable than that of
housemaid a distinction which made Diantha smile rather bitterly Even
her father wrote to her once suggesting that if she chose to invest
her salary according to his advice he could double it for her in a year
maybe treble it in Belgian hares

_Theyd_ double and treble fast enough she admitted to herself but
she wrote as pleasant a letter as she could declining his proposition

Her mother seemed stronger and became more sympathetic as the months
passed Large affairs always appealed to her more than small ones and
she offered valuable suggestions as to the account keeping of the big
house They all assumed that she was permanently settled in this well
paid position and she made no confidences But all summer long
she planned and read and studied out her progressive schemes and
strengthened her hold among the working women

Laundress after laundress she studied personally and tested
professionally finding a general level of mediocrity till finally
she hit upon a melancholy Danea big rawboned redfaced womanwhose
husband had been a miller but was hurt about the head so that he was no
longer able to earn his living The huge fellow was docile quiet and
endlessly strong but needed constant supervision

Hell do anything you tell him Miss and do it well but then hell
sit and dream about itI cant leave him at all But hell take the
clothes if I give him a paper with directions and come right back
Poor Mrs Thorald wiped her eyes and went on with her swift ironing

Diantha offered her the position of laundress at Union House with two
rooms for their own over the laundry Therell be work for him too
she said We need a man there He can do a deal of the heavier workbe
porter you know I cant offer him very much but it will help some

Mrs Thorald accepted for both and considered Diantha as a special
providence

There was to be cook and two capable second maids The work of the
house must be done thoroughly well Diantha determined and the foods
got to be goodor the girls wont stay After much consideration she
selected one Julianna a person of color for her kitchen not the
jovial and sloppy personage usually figuring in this character but a
tall angular and somewhat cynical woman a misanthrope in fact with a
small son For men she had no respect whatever but conceded a grudging
admiration to Mr Thorald as the usefullest biddablest male person
she had ever seen She also extended special sympathy to Mrs Thorald on
account of her peculiar burden and the Swedish woman had no antipathy
to her color and seemed to take a melancholy pleasure in Juliannas
caustic speeches

Diantha offered her the place boy and all He can be bell boy and
help you in the kitchen too Cant you Hector Hector rolled
large adoring eyes at her but said nothing His mother accepted the
proposition but without enthusiasm I cant keep no eye on him Miss
if Im cookin an lessn you keep your eye on him theys no work to be
got outn any kind o boy

What is your last name Julianna Diantha asked her

I suppose as a matter o fac its de name of de last nigger I
married she replied Dere was several of em all havin different
names and to tell you de truf Mis Bell I got clean mixed amongst em
But Juliannas my nameworld without end amen

So Diantha had to waive her theories about the surnames of servants in
this case

Did they all die she asked with polite sympathy

Nom dey didnt none of em dieworse luck

Im afraid you have seen much trouble Julianna she continued
sympathetically They deserted you I suppose

Julianna laid her long spoon upon the table and stood up with great
gravity Nom she said again dey didnt none of em desert me on no
occasion I divorced em

Marital difficulties in bulk were beyond Dianthas comprehension and
she dropped the subject

Union House opened in the autumn The vanished pepper trees were dim
with dust in Orchardina streets as the long rainless summer drew to
a close but the social atmosphere fairly sparkled with new interest
Those who had not been away chattered eagerly with those who had and
both with the incoming tide of winter visitors

That girl of Mrs Pornes has started her housekeeping shop

That Miss Bell has got Mrs Weatherstone fairly infatuated with her
crazy schemes

Do you know that Bell girl has actually taken Union House Going to
make a Girls Club of it

Did you ever _hear_ of such a thing Diantha Bells really going to try
to run her absurd undertaking right here in Orchardina

They did not know that the young captain of industry had deliberately
chosen Orchardina as her starting point on account of the special
conditions The even climate was favorable to going out by the day or
the delivery of meals the number of wealthy residents gave opportunity
for catering on a large scale the crowding tourists and health seekers
made a market for all manner of transient service and cooked food and
the constant lack of sufficient or capable servants forced the people
into an unwilling consideration of any plan of domestic assistance

In a years deliberate effort Diantha had acquainted herself with the
rank and file of the towns housemaids and day workers and picked her
assistants carefully She had studied the local conditions thoroughly
and knew her ground A big faded building that used to be the Hotel
in Orchardinas infant days standing awkward and dingy on a site too
valuable for a house lot and not yet saleable as a business block was
the working base

A half year with Mrs Weatherstone gave her 500 in cash besides the
100 she had saved at Mrs Pornes and Mrs Weatherstones cheerfully
offered backing gave her credit

I hate to let you said Diantha I want to do it all myself

You are a painfully perfect person Miss Bell said her last employer
pleasantly but you have ceased to be my housekeeper and I hope you
will continue to be my friend As a friend I claim the privilege
of being disagreeable If you have a fault it is conceit Immovable
Colossal Conceit And Obstinacy

Is that all asked Diantha

Its all Ive foundso far gaily retorted Mrs Weatherstone Dont
you see child that you cant afford to wait You have reasons for
hastening you know I dont doubt you could in a series of years
work up this business all stark alone I have every confidence in those
qualities I have mentioned But whats the use Youll need credit for
groceries and furniture I am profoundly interested in this business
I am more than willing to advance a little capital or to ensure your
credit A man would have sense enough to take me up at once

I believe you are right Diantha reluctantly agreed And you shant
lose by it

Her friends were acutely interested in her progress and showed it in
practical ways The New Womans Club furnished five families of
patrons for the regular service of cooked food which soon grew with
satisfaction to a dozen or so varying from time to time The many
families with invalids and lonely invalids without families were glad
to avail themselves of the special delicacies furnished at Union House
Picnickers found it easier to buy Dianthas marvelous sandwiches than to
spend golden morning hours in putting up inferior ones at home and many
who cooked for themselves or kept servants were glad to profit by this
outside source on Sunday evenings and days out

There was opposition too both the natural resistance of inertia and
prejudice and the active malignity of Mrs Thaddler

The Pornes were sympathetic and anxious

That placell cost her all of 10000 a year with those twentyfive to
feed and they only pay 450 a weekI know that said Mr Porne

It does look impossible his wife agreed but such is my faith in
Diantha Bell Id back her against Rockefeller

Mrs Weatherstone was not alarmed at all If she _should_ failwhich
I dont for a moment expectit wont ruin me she told Isabel And if
she succeeds as I firmly believe she will why Id be willing to risk
almost anything to prove Mrs Thaddler in the wrong

Mrs Thaddler was making herself rather disagreeable She used
what power she had to cry down the undertaking and was so actively
malevolent that her husband was moved to covert opposition He never
argued with his wifeshe was easily ahead of him in that art and if
it came to recriminations had certain controvertible charges to make
against him which mode him angrily silent He was convinced in a dim
way that her ruthless domineering spirit and the sheer malice she often
showed were more evil things than his own bad habits and that even
in their domestic relation her behavior really caused him more pain
and discomfort than he caused her but he could not convince her of it
naturally

That Diantha Bell is a fine girl he said to himself A damn fine
girl and as straight as a string

There had crept out through the quenchless leak of servants talk a
varicolored version of the incident of Mathew and the transom and the
town had grown so warm for that young gentleman that he had gone to
Alaska suddenly to cool off as it were His Grandmother finding
Mrs Thaddler invincible with this new weapon and what she had so long
regarded as her home now visibly Mrs Weatherstones had retired in
regal dignity to her old Philadelphia establishment where she upheld
the standard of decorum against the weakening habits of a deteriorated
world for many years

As Mr Thaddler thought of this sweeping victory he chuckled for the
hundredth time She ought to make good and she will Somethings got
to be done about it said he

Diantha had never liked Mr Thaddler she did not like that kind of man
in general nor his manner toward her in particular Moreover he was the
husband of Mrs Thaddler She did not know that he was still the largest
owner in the towns best grocery store and when that store offered
her special terms for her exclusive trade she accepted the proposition
thankfully

She told Ross about it as a matter well within his knowledge if not
his liking and he was mildly interested I am much alarmed at this new
venture he wrote but you must get your experience I wish I could
save you As to the groceries those are wholesale rates nearly
theyll make enough on it Yours is a large order you see and steady

When she opened her Business Mens Lunch Mr Thaddler had a still
better opportunity He had a reputation as a high flyer and had really
intended to sacrifice himself on the altar of friendship by patronizing
and praising this undertaking at any cost to his palate but no
sacrifice was needed

Dianthas group of day workers had their early breakfast and
departed taking each her neat lunchpailthey ate nothing of their
employersand both kitchen and dining room would have stood idle till
supper time But the young manager knew she must work her plant for all
it was worth and speedily opened the dining room with the side entrance
as a Caffeteria with the larger one as a sort of meeting place
papers and magazines on the tables

From the counter you took what you liked and seated yourself and your
friends at one of the many small tables or in the flatarmed chairs
in the big room or on the broad piazza and as this gave good food
cheapness a chance for a comfortable seat and talk and a smoke if one
had time it was largely patronized

Mr Thaddler as an experienced _bon vivant_ despised sandwiches
Picnicky makeshifts he called themrailroad rationsbread and
leavings and when he saw these piles on piles of sandwiches listed
only as No 1 No 2 No 3 and so on his benevolent intention
wavered But he pulled himself together and took a plateful assorted

Come on Porne he said well play its a Sunday school picnic
and he drew himself a cup of coffee finding hot milk cream and sugar
crystals at hand I never saw a cheap joint where you could fix it
yourself before he saidand suspiciously tasted the mixture

By jing Thats coffee he cried in surprise Theres no scum on the
milk and the creams cream Five cents She wont get rich on this

Then he applied himself to his No 1 sandwich and his determined
expression gave way to one of pleasure Why thats breadreal bread I
believe she made it herself

She did in truthshe and Julianna with Hector as general assistant
The big oven was filled several times every morning the fresh rolls
disappeared at breakfast and supper the fresh bread was packed in the
lunch pails and the stale bread was even now melting away in large
bites behind the smiling mouths and mustaches of many men Perfect
bread excellent butter and Whats the filling Id like to know
More than one inquiringminded patron split his sandwich to add sight
to taste but few could be sure of the flavorsome contents fatless
gritless smooth and even covering the entire surface the last
mouthful as perfect as the first Some were familiar some new all were
delicious

The six sandwiches were five cents the cup of coffee five and the
little drop cakes sweet and spicy were two for five Every man spent
fifteen cents some of them more and many took away small cakes in
paper bags if there were any left

I dont see how you can do it and make a profit urged Mr Eltwood
making a pastorial call They are so good you know

Diantha smiled cheerfully Thats because all your ideas are based on
what we call domestic economy which is domestic waste I buy in large
quantities at wholesale rates and my cook with her little helper the
two maids and my own share of the work of course provides for the
lot Of course one has to know how

Whenever did you findor did you createthose heavenly sandwiches
he asked

I have to thank my laundress for part of that success she said
Shes a Dane and it appears that the Danes are so fond of sandwiches
that in large establishments they have a sandwich kitchen to prepare
them It is quite a bit of work but they are good and inexpensive
There is no limit to the variety

As a matter of fact this lunch business paid well and led to larger
things

The girls methods were simple and so organized as to make one hand wash
the other Her house had some twentyodd bedrooms full accommodations
for kitchen and laundry work on a large scale big dining dancing and
reception rooms and broad shady piazzas on the sides Its position on a
corner near the business part of the little city and at the foot of the
hill crowned with so many millionaires and near millionaires as could
get land there offered many advantages and every one was taken

The main part of the undertaking was a House Workers Union a group
of thirty girls picked and trained These previously working out as
servants had received six dollars a week and found They now worked
an agreed number of hours were paid on a basis by the hour or day and
found themselves Each had her own room and the broad porches and
ball room were theirs except when engaged for dances and meetings of
one sort and another

It was a stirring years work hard but exciting and the only
difficulty which really worried Diantha was the same that worried the
average housewifethe accounts




CHAPTER XI THE POWER OF THE SCREW


 Your car is too big for one person to stir
 Your chauffeur is a little man too
 Yet he lifts that machine does the little chauffeur
 By the power of a gentle jackscrew


Diantha worked

For all her employees she demanded a tenhour day she worked fourteen
rising at six and not getting to bed till eleven when her charges were
all safely in their rooms for the night

They were all up at fivethirty or thereabouts breakfasting at six and
the girls off in time to reach their various places by seven Their day
was from 7 A M to 830 P M with half an hour out from 1130 to
twelve for their lunch and three hours between 220 and 530 for
their own time including their tea Then they worked again from 530
to 830 on the dinner and the dishes and then they came home to a
pleasant nine oclock supper and had all hour to dance or rest before
the 1030 bell for bed time

Special friends and cousins often came home with them and frequently
shared the supperfor a quarterand the dance for nothing

It was no light matter in the first place to keep twenty girls contented
with such a regime and working with the steady excellence required and
in the second place to keep twenty employers contented with them There
were failures on both sides half a dozen families gave up the plan and
it took time to replace them and three girls had to be asked to resign
before the year was over But most of them had been in training in the
summer and had listened for months to Dianthas earnest talks to the
clubs with good results

Remember we are not doing this for ourselves alone she would say to
them Our experiment is going to make this kind of work easier for all
home workers everywhere You may not like it at first but neither did
you like the old way It will grow easier as we get used to it and we
_must_ keep the rules because we made them

She laboriously composed a neat little circular distributed it widely
and kept a pile in her lunch room for people to take

It read thus


 UNION HOUSE

 General Housework by the week 1000
 General Housework by the day 200

 Additional labor by the hour 20
 Special service for entertainments maids and waitresses

What annoyed the young manager most was the uncertainty and irregularity
involved in her work the facts varying considerably from her
calculations

In the house all ran smoothly Solemn Mrs Thorvald did the laundry
work for thirtyfiveby the aid of her husband and a big mangle for the
flat work The girls washing was limited You have to be reasonable
about it Diantha had explained to them Your fifty cents covers a
dozen piecesno more If you want more you have to pay more just as
your employers do for your extra time

This last often happened No one on the face of it could ask more than
ten hours of the swift steady work given by the girls at but a fraction
over 14 cents an hour Yet many times the housekeeper was anxious for
more labor on special days and the girls unaccustomed to the three
free hours in the afternoon were quite willing to furnish it thus
adding somewhat to their cash returns

They had a dressmaking class at the club afternoons and as Union House
boasted a good sewing machine many of them spent the free hours in
enlarging their wardrobes Some amused themselves with light reading a
few studied others met and walked outside The sense of honest leisure
grew upon them with its broadening influence and among her thirty
Diantha found four or five who were able and ambitious and willing to
work heartily for the further development of the business

Her two housemaids were specially selected When the girls were out of
the house these two maids washed the breakfast dishes with marvelous
speed and then helped Diantha prepare for the lunch This was a large
undertaking and all three of them as well as Julianna and Hector
worked at it until some six or eight hundred sandwiches were ready and
two or three hundred little cakes

Diantha had her own lunch and then sat at the receipt of custom during
the lunch hour making change and ordering fresh supplies as fast as
needed

The two housemaids had a long day but so arranged that it made but ten
hours work and they had much available time of their own They had to
be at work at 530 to set the table for six oclock breakfast and then
they were at it steadily with the dining rooms to do and the lunch
to get ready until 1130 when they had an hour to eat and rest From
1230 to 4 oclock they were busy with the lunch cups the bedrooms
and setting the table for dinner but after that they had four hours to
themselves until the nine oclock supper was over and once more
they washed dishes for half an hour The caffeteria used only cups and
spoons the sandwiches and cakes were served on paper plates

In the handcart methods of small housekeeping it is impossible to exact
the swift precision of such work but not in the standardized tasks and
regular hours of such an establishment as this

Diantha religiously kept her hour at noon and tried to keep the three
in the afternoon but the employer and manager cannot take irresponsible
rest as can the employee She felt like a most inexperienced captain
on a totally new species of ship and her paper plans looked very weak
sometimes as bills turned out to be larger than she had allowed for
or her patronage unaccountably dwindled But if the difficulties were
great the girls courage was greater It is simply a big piece of
work she assured herself and may be a long one but there never
was anything better worth doing Every new business has difficulties I
mustnt think of them I must just push and push and pusha little more
every day

And then she would draw on all her powers to reason with laugh at and
persuade some dissatisfied girl or hardest of all to bring in a new
one to fill a vacancy

She enjoyed the details of her lunch business and studied it carefully
planning for a restaurant a little later Her bread was baked in long
cylindrical closed pans and cut by machinery into thin even slices
not a crust wasted for they were ground into crumbs and used in the
cooking

The filling for her sandwiches was made from fish flesh and fowl from
cheese and jelly and fruit and vegetables and so named or numbered that
the general favorites were gradually determined

Mr Thaddler chatted with her over the counter as far as she would
allow it and discoursed more fully with his friends on the verandah

Porne he said whered that girl come from anyway Shes a genius
thats what she is a regular genius

Shes all that said Mr Porne and a benefactor to humanity thrown
in I wish shed start her food delivery though Im tired of those two
Swedes already Ocome from Up in Jopalez Inca County I believe

New England stock I bet said Mr Thaddler Its a damn shame the way
the women go on about her

Not all of them surely protested Mr Porne

No not all of embut enough of em to make mischief you may be
sure Women are the devil sometimes

Mr Porne smiled without answer and Mr Thaddler went sulking awaya
bag of cakes bulging in his pocket

The little wooden hotel in Jopalez boasted an extra visitor a few days
later A big red faced man who strolled about among the tradesmen
tried the barbers shop loafed in the post office hired a rig and
traversed the length and breadth of the town and who called on Mrs
Warden talking real estate with her most politely in spite of her
protestation and the scornful looks of the four daughters who bought
tobacco and matches in the grocery store and sat on the piazza thereof
to smoke as did other gentlemen of leisure

Ross Warden occasionally leaned at the door jamb with folded arms He
never could learn to be easily sociable with ranchmen and teamsters
Serve them he must but chat with them he need not The stout gentleman
essayed some conversation but did not get far Ross was polite but
far from encouraging and presently went home to supper leaving a
carrothaired boy to wait upon his lingering customers

Nice young feller enough said the stout gentleman to himself but
raised on ramrods Never got em from those women folks of his either
He _has_ a row to hoe And he departed as he had come

Mr Eltwood turned out an unexpectedly useful friend to Diantha He
steered club meetings and sociables into her large rooms and as
people found how cheap and easy it was to give parties that way they
continued the habit He brought his doctor friends to sample the lunch
and they tested the value of Dianthas invalid cookery and were more
than pleased

Hungry tourists were wholly without prejudice and prized her lunches
for their own sake They descended upon the caffeteria in chattering
swarms some days robbing the regular patrons of their food and sent
sudden orders for picnic lunches that broke in upon the routine hours of
the place unmercifully

But of all her patrons the families of invalids appreciated Dianthas
work the most Where a little shack or tent was all they could afford
to live in or where the tiny cottage was more than filled with the
patient attending relative and nurse this depot of supplies was a
relief indeed

A girl could be had for an hour or two or two girls together with
amazing speed could put a small house in dainty order while the sick
man lay in his hammock under the pepper trees and be gone before he was
fretting for his bed again They lived upon her lunches and from them
and other quarters rose an increasing demand for regular cooked food

Why dont you go into it at once urged Mrs Weatherstone

I want to establish the day service first said Diantha It is a
pretty big business I find and I do get tired sometimes I cant afford
to slip up you know I mean to take it up next fall though

All right And look here see that you begin in first rate shape Ive
got some ideas of my own about those food containers

They discussed the matter more than once Diantha most reluctant to take
any assistance Mrs Weatherstone determined that she should

I feel like a big investor already she said I dont think even
you realize the _money_ there is in this thing You are interested
in establishing the working girls and saving money and time for the
housewives I am interested in making money out of ithonestly It
would be such a triumph

Youre very good Diantha hesitated

Im not good Im most eagerly and selfishly interested Ive taken a
new lease of life since knowing you Diantha Bell You see my father
was a business man and his father before himI _like it_ There I was
with lots of money and not an interest in life Nowwhy theres
no end to this thing Diantha Its one of the biggest businesses on
earthif not _the_ biggest

YesI know the girl answered But its slow work I feel the weight
of it more than I expected Theres every reason to succeed but theres
the combined sentiment of the whole world to liftits as heavy as
lead

Heavy Of course its heavy The more fun to lift it Youll do it
Diantha I know you will with that steady relentless push of yours
But the cooked food is going to be your biggest power and you must let
me start it right Now you listen to me and make Mrs Thaddler eat her
words

Mrs Thaddlers words would have proved rather poisonous if eaten She
grew more antagonistic as the year advanced Every fault that could be
found in the undertaking she pounced upon and enlarged every doubt that
could be cast upon it she heavily piled up and her opposition grew more
rancorous as Mr Thaddler enlarged in her hearing upon the excellence of
Dianthas lunches and the wonders of her management

Shes picked a bunch o winners in those girls of hers he declared to
his friends They set out in the morning looking like a flock of sweet
peasin their pinks and whites and greens and viletsand do more
work in an hour than the average slavey can do in three Im told

It was a pretty sight to see those girls start out They had a sort of
uniform as far as a neat gingham dress went with elbow sleeves white
ruffled and a Dutch collar a sort of cross between a nurses dress and
that of La Chocolataire but colors were left to taste Each carried
her apron and a cap that covered the hair while cooking and sweeping
but nothing that suggested the black and white livery of the regulation
servant

This is a new stage of labor their leader reminded them You are
not servantsyou are employees You wear a cap as an English carpenter
doesor a French cookand an apron because your work needs it It is
not a ruffled labelits a business necessity And each one of us must
do our best to make this new kind of work valued and respected

It is no easy matter to overcome prejudices many centuries old and meet
the criticism of women who have nothing to do but criticize Those who
were mistresses and wanted servantssomeone to do their will at
any moment from early morning till late eveningwere not pleased with
the new way if they tried it but the women who had interests of their
own to attend to who merely wanted their homes kept clean and the
food well cooked and served were pleased The speed the accuracy the
economy the pleasant quiet assured manner of these skilled employees
was a very different thing from the old slipshod methods of the ordinary
general servant

So the work slowly prospered while Diantha began to put in execution
the new plan she had been forced into

While it matured Mrs Thaddler matured hers With steady dropping she
had let fall far and wide her suspicions as to the character of Union
House

It looks pretty queer to me she would say confidentially All those
girls together and no person to have any authority over them Not a
married woman in the house but that washerwomanand her husbands a
fool

And again You dont see how she does it Neither do I The expenses
must be tremendousthose girls pay next to nothingand all that broth
and brown bread flying about town Pretty queer doings I think

The men seem to like that caffeteria dont they urged one caller
perhaps not unwilling to nestle Mrs Thaddler who flushed darkly as she
replied Yes they do Men usually like that sort of place

They like good food at low prices if thats what you mean her
visitor answered

Thats not all I meanby a long way said Mrs Thaddler She said so
much and said it so ingeniously that a dark rumor arose from nowhere
and grew rapidly Several families discharged their Union House girls
Several girls complained that they were insultingly spoken to on the
street Even the lunch patronage began to fall off

Diantha was puzzleda little alarmed Her slow steady lifting of the
prejudice against her was checked She could not put her finger on the
enemy yet felt one distinctly and had her own suspicions But she also
had her new move well arranged by this time

Then a maliciously insinuating story of the place came out in a San
Francisco paper and a flock of local reporters buzzed in to sample the
victim They helped themselves to the luncheon and liked it but that
did not soften their pens They talked with such of the girls as they
could get in touch with and wrote such versions of these talks as
suited them

They called repeatedly at Union House but Diantha refused to see them
Finally she was visited by the Episcopalian clergyman He had heard
her talk at the Club was favorably impressed by the girl herself and
honestly distressed by the dark stories he now heard about Union House

My dear young lady he said I have called to see you in your own
interests I do not as you perhaps know approve of your schemes I
consider themahsubversive of the best interests of the home But
I think you mean well though mistakenly Now I fear you are not aware
that thisahillconsidered undertaking of yours is giving rise to
considerable adverse comment in the community There isahthere is a
great deal being said about this business of yours which I am sure you
would regret if you knew it Do you think it is wise do you think it
isahright my dear Miss Bell to attempt to carry on aa place of
this sort without the presence of aof a Matron of assured standing

Diantha smiled rather coldly

May I trouble you to step into the back parlor Dr Aberthwaite she
said and then

May I have the pleasure of presenting to you Mrs Henderson Bellmy
mother



Wasnt it great said Mrs Weatherstone I was there you seeId
come to call on Mrs Bellshes a dearand in came Mrs Thaddler

Mrs Thaddler

O I know it was old Aberthwaite but he represented Mrs Thaddler and
her clique and had come there to preach to Diantha about proprietyI
heard himand she brought him in and very politely introduced him to
her motherit was rich Isabel

How did Diantha manage it asked her friend

Shes been trying to arrange it for ever so long Of course her father
objectedyoud know that But theres a sisternot a bad sort only
very limited shes taken the old man to board as it were and I guess
the mother really set her foot down for oncesaid she had a right to
visit her own daughter

It would seem so Mrs Porne agreed I _am_ so glad It will be so
much easier for that brave little woman now

It was

Diantha held her mother in her arms the night she came and cried tike a
baby

O mother _dear_ she sobbed Id no idea I should miss you so much O
you blessed comfort

Her mother cried a bit too she enjoyed this daughter more than either
of her older children and missed her more A mother loves all her
children naturally but a mother is also a personand may without
sin have personal preferences

She took hold of Dianthas tangled mass of papers with the eagerness of
a questing hound

Youve got all the bills of course she demanded with her anxious
rising inflection

Every one said the girl You taught me that much What puzzles me
is to make things balance Im making more than I thought in some lines
and less in others and I cant make it come out straight

It wont altogether till the end of the year I dare say said Mrs
Bell but lets get clear as far as we can In the first place we must
separate your businesssee how much each one pays

The first one I want to establish said her daughter is the girls
club Not just this one with me to run it But to show that any group
of twenty or thirty girls could do this thing in any city Of course
where rents and provisions were high theyd have to charge more I want
to make an average showing somehow Now can you disentangle the girl
part front the lunch part and the food part mother dear and make it
all straight

Mrs Bell could and did it gave her absolute delight to do it She set
down the total of Dianthas expenses so far in the Service Department
as follows

 Rent of Union House 1500
 Rent of furniture 300
 One payment on furniture 400
 Fuel and lights etc 352
 Service of 5 at 10 a week each 2600
 Food for thirtyseven 3848
 
 Total 9000

That covers everything but my board said Mrs Bell

Now your income is easy35 x 450 equals 8190 Take that from your
9000 and you are 810 behind

Yes I know said Diantha eagerly but if it was merely a girls
club home the rent and fixtures would be much less A home could be
built with thirty bedroomsand all necessary conveniencesfor 7000
Ive asked Mr and Mrs Porne about it and the furnishing neednt cost
over 2000 if it was very plain Ten per cent of that is a rent of
900 you see

I see said her mother Better say a thousand I guess it could be
done for that

So they set down rent 1000

There have to be five paid helpers in the house Diantha went on the
cook the laundress the two maids and the matron She must buy and
manage She could be one of their mothers or aunts

Mrs Bell smiled Do you really imagine Diantha that Mrs
OShaughnessy or Mrs Yon Yonson can manage a house like this as you
can

Diantha flushed a little No mother of course not But I am keeping
very full reports of all the work Just the schedule of laborthe
hoursthe exact things done One laundress with machinery can
wash for thirtyfive its only six a day you see and the amount is
regulated about six dozen a day and all the flat work mangled

In a Girls Club alone the cook has all day off as it were she can do
the down stairs cleaning And the two maids have only table service and
bedrooms

Thirtyfive bedrooms

Yes But two girls together who know how can do a room in 8
minuteseasily They are small and simple you see Make the bed shake
the mats wipe the floors and windowsyou watch them

I have watched them the mother admitted They are as quick asas
millworkers

Well pursued Diantha they spend three hours on dishes and tables
and seven on cleaning The bedrooms take 280 minutes thats nearly five
hours The other two are for the bath rooms halls stairs downstairs
windows and so on Thats all right Then Im keeping the menusjust
what I furnish and what it costs Anybody could order and manage when
it was all set down for her And you seeas you have figured ittheyd
have over 500 leeway to buy the furniture if they were allowed to

Yes Mrs Bell admitted _if_ the rent was what you allow and _if_
they all work all the time

Thats the hitch of course But mother the girls who dont have
steady jobs do work by the hour and that brings in more on the whole
If they are the right kind they can make good If they find anyone who
dont keep her jobfor good reasonsthey can drop her

Mm said Mrs Bell Well its an interesting experiment But how
about you So far you are 410 behind

Yes because my rents so big But I cover that by letting the rooms
you see

Mrs Bell considered the orders of this sort So far it averages about
2500 a week thats doing well

It will be less in summermuch less Diantha suggested Suppose you
call it an average of 1500

Call it 1000 said her mother ruthlessly At that it covers your
deficit and 110 over

Which isnt much to live on Diantha agreed but then comes my
special catering and the lunches

Here they were quite at sea for a while But as the months passed and
the work steadily grew on their hands Mrs Bell became more and more
cheerful She was up with the earliest took entire charge of the
financial part of the concern and at last Diantha was able to rest
fully in her afternoon hours What delighted her most was to see her
mother thrive in the work Her thin shoulders lifted a little as small
dragging tasks were forgotten and a large growing business substituted
Her eyes grew bright again she held her head as she did in her keen
girlhood and her daughter felt fresh hope and power as she saw already
the benefit of the new method as affecting her nearest and dearest

All Dianthas friends watched the spread of the work with keenly
sympathetic intent but to Mrs Weatherstone it became almost as
fascinating as to the girl herself

Its going to be one of the finest businesses in the world she said
And one of the largest and best paying Now Ill have a surprise
ready for that girl in the spring and another next year if Im not
mistaken

There were long and vivid discussions of the matter between her and
her friends the Pornes and Mrs Porne spent more hours in her drawing
room than she had for years

But while these unmentioned surprises were pending Mrs Weatherstone
departed to New Yorkto Europe and was gone some months In the spring
she returned in Aprilwhich is late June in Orchardina She called
upon Diantha and her mother at once and opened her attack

I do hope Mrs Bell that youll back me up she said You have the
better business head I think in the financial line

She has Diantha admitted Shes ten times as good as I am at
that but shes no more willing to carry obligation than I am Mrs
Weatherstone

Obligation is one thinginvestment is another said her guest
I live on my moneythat is on other peoples work I am a base
capitalist and you seem to me good material to invest in Sotake it
or leave itIve brought you an offer

She then produced from her hand bag some papers and from her car
outside a large object carefully boxed about the size and shape of a
plate warmer This being placed on the table before them was uncovered
and proved to be a food container of a new model

I had one made in Paris she explained and the rest copied here to
save paying duty Lift it

They lifted it in amazementit was so light

Aluminum she said proudly Silver platednew process And bamboo
at the corners you see All lined and interlined with asbestos rubber
fittings for silver ware plate racks food compartmentssee

She pulled out drawers opened little doors and rapidly laid out a
table service for five

It will hold food for fivethe average family you know For larger
orders youll have to send more I had to make _some_ estimate

What lovely dishes said Diantha

Arent they Aluminum silvered If your washers are careful they wont
get dented and you cant break em

Mrs Bell examined the case and all its fittings with eager attention

Its the prettiest thing I ever saw she said Look Diantha heres
for soup heres for wateror wine if you want all your knives and
forks at the side Japanese napkins up here Its lovely butI should
thinkexpensive

Mrs Weatherstone smiled Ive had twentyfive of them made They cost
with the fittings 100 apiece 2500 I will rent them to you Miss
Bell at a rate of 10 per cent interest only 250 a year

It ought to take more said Mrs Bell therell be breakage and
waste

You cant break them I tell you said the cheerful visitor and
dents can be smoothed out in any tin shopyoull have to pay for
itwill that satisfy you

Diantha was looking at her her eyes deep with gratitude Iyou know
what I think of you she said

Mrs Weatherstone laughed Im not through yet she said Look at my
next piece of impudence This was only on paper but the pictures were
amply illuminating

I went to several factories she gleefully explained here and
abroad A Yankee firm built it Its in my garage now

It was a light gasolene motor wagon the body built like those
oldfashioned moving wagons which were also used for excursions wherein
the floor of the vehicle was rather narrow and set low and the seats
ran lengthwise widening out over the wheels only here the wheels were
lower and in the space under the seats ran a row of lockers opening
outside Mrs Weatherstone smiled triumphantly

Now Diantha Bell she said heres something you havent thought
of I do believe This estimable vehicle will carry thirty people inside
easily and she showed them how each side held twelve and turnup
seats accommodated six more and outsideshe showed the lengthwise
pictureit carries twentyfour containers If you want to send all
your twentyfive at once one can go here by the driver

Now then This is not an obligation Miss Bell it is another valuable
investment Im having more made I expect to have use for them in a
good many places This cost pretty near 3000 and you get it at the
same good interest for 300 a year Whats more if you are smart
enoughand I dont doubt you areyou can buy the whole thing on
installments same as you mean to with your furniture

Diantha was dumb but her mother wasnt She thanked Mrs Weatherstone
with a hearty appreciation of her opportune help but no less of her
excellent investment

Dont be a goose Diantha she said You will set up your
food business in first class style and I think you can carry it
successfully But Mrs Weatherstones right shes got a new investment
here thatll pay her better than most othersand be a growing thing I
do believe

And still Diantha found it difficult to express her feelings She had
lived under a good deal of strain for many months now and this sudden
opening out of her plans was a heavenly help indeed

Mrs Weatherstone went around the table and sat by her Child said
she you dont begin to realize what youve done for meand for
Isobeland for ever so many in this town and all over the world And
besides dont you think anybody else can see your dream We cant _do_
it as you can but we can see what its going to meanand well help
if we can You wouldnt grudge us that would you

As a result of all this the cooked food delivery service was opened at
once

It is true that the tourists are gone mostly said Mrs Weatherstone
as she urged it but you see there are ever so many residents who have
more trouble with servants in summer than they do in winter and hate to
have a fire in the house too

So Dianthas circulars had an addition forthwith

These were distributed among the Orchardinians setting their tongues
wagging anew as a fresh breeze stirs the eaves of the forest

The stealthy inroads of lunches and evening refreshments had been
deprecated already this new kind of servant who wasnt a servant
but held her head up like anyone else They are as independent
asassalesladies said one critic was also viewed with alarm
but when even this domestic assistant was to be removed and a square
case of food and dishes substituted all Archaic Orchardina was
horrified

There were plenty of new minds in the place however enough to start
Diantha with seven full orders and five partial ones

Her work at the club was now much easier thanks to her mothers
assistance to the smoother running of all the machinery with the
passing of time and further to the fact that most of her girls were now
working at summer resorts for shorter hours and higher wages They paid
for their rooms at the club still but the work of the house was so much
lightened that each of the employees was given two weeks of vacationon
full pay

The lunch department kept on a pretty regular basis from the patronage
of resident business men and the young managerin her ambitious
momentsplanned for enlarging it in the winter But during the summer
her whole energies went to perfecting the _menus_ and the service of her
food delivery

Mrs Porne was the very first to order She had been waiting impatiently
for a chance to try the plan and with her husband had the firmest
faith in Dianthas capacity to carry it through

We dont save much in money she explained to the eager Mrs Ree who
hovered fascinated over the dangerous topic but we do in comfort I
can tell you You see I had two girls paid them 12 a week now I keep
just the one for 6 My food and fuel for the four of us I dont count
the babies either timethey remain as before was all of 16 often
more That made 28 a week Now I pay for three meals a day delivered
for three of us 15 a weekwith the nurses wages 21 Then I pay a
laundress one day 2 and her two meals 50 making 2350 Then I
have two maids for an hour a day to clean 50 a day for six days
3 and one maid Sunday 25 2675 in all So we only make 125
_But_ theres another room We have the cooks room for an extra guest
I use it most for a sewing room though and the kitchen is a sort of day
nursery now The house seems as big again

But the food eagerly inquired Mrs Ree Is it as good as your own
Is it hot and tempting

Mrs Ree was fascinated by the new heresy As a staunch adherent of the
old Home and Culture Club and its older ideals she disapproved of the
undertaking but her curiosity was keen about it

Mrs Porne smiled patiently You remember Diantha Bells cooking I
am sure Mrs Ree she said And Julianna used to cook for dinner
partieswhen one could get her My Swede was a very ordinary cook as
most of these untrained girls are Do take off your hat and have dinner
with usIll show you urged Mrs Porne

IO I mustnt fluttered the little woman Theyll expect me at
homeandsurely yoursupplydoesnt allow for guests

Well arrange all that by phone her hostess explained and she
promptly sent word to the Ree household then called up Union House and
ordered one extra dinner

Is itIm dreadfully rude I know but Im _so_ interested Is
itexpensive

Mrs Porne smiled Havent you seen the little circular Heres one
Extra meals to regular patrons 25 cents And no more trouble to order
than to tell a maid

Mrs Ree had a lively sense of paltering with Satan as she sat down to
the Pornes dinner table She had seen the delivery wagon drive to the
door had heard the man deposit something heavy on the back porch and
was now confronted by a butlers tray at Mrs Pornes left whereon
stood a neat square shining object with silvery panels and bamboo
trimmings

Its not at all bad looking is it she ventured

Not bad enough to spoil ones appetite Mr Porne cheerily agreed

Open Sesame Now you know the worst

Mrs Porne opened it and an inner front was shown with various small
doors and drawers

Do you know what is in it asked the guest

No thank goodness I dont replied her hostess If theres anything
tiresome it is to order meals and always know whats coming Thats what
men get so tired of at restaurants what they hate so when their wives
ask them what they want for dinner Now I can enjoy my dinner at my own
table just as if I was a guest

It isa taxsometimes Mrs Ree admitted adding hastily But one
is glad to do itto make home attractive

Mr Pornes eyes sought his wifes and love and contentment flashed
between them as she quietly set upon the table three silvery plates

Not silver surely said Mrs Ree lifting hers Oh aluminum

Aluminum silver plated said Mr Porne Theyve learned how to do it
at last Its a problem of weight you see and breakage Aluminum isnt
pretty glass and silver are heavy but we all love silver and theres
a pleasant sense of gorgeousness in this outfit

It did look rather impressive silver tumblers silver dishes the whole
dainty serviceand so surprisingly light

You see she knows that it is very important to please the eye as well
as the palate said Mr Porne Now speaking of palates let us all
keep silent and taste this soup They did keep silent in supreme
contentment while the soup lasted Mrs Ree laid down her spoon with the
air of one roused from a lovely dream

Whywhyits like Paris she said in an awed tone

Isnt it Mr Porne agreed and not twice alike in a month I think

Why there arent thirty kinds of soup are there she urged

I never thought there were when we kept servants said he Three was
about their limit and greasy at that

Mrs Porne slipped the soup plates back in their place and served the
meat

She does not give a fish course does she Mrs Ree observed

Not at the table dhote price Mrs Porne answered We never
pretended to have a fish course ourselvesdo you Mrs Ree did not
and eagerly disclaimed any desire for fish The meat was roast beef
thinly sliced hot and juicy

Dont you miss the carving Mr Porne asked the visitor I do so
love to see a man at the head of his own table carving

I do miss it Mrs Ree I miss it every day of my life with devout
thankfulness I never was a good carver so it was no pleasure to me to
show off and to tell you the truth when I come to the table I like
to eatnot saw wood And Mr Porne ate with every appearance of
satisfaction

We never get roast beef like this Im sure Mrs Ree admitted we
cant get it small enough for our family

And a little roast is always spoiled in the cooking Yes this is far
better than we used to have agreed her hostess

Mrs Ree enjoyed every mouthful of her meal The soup was hot The salad
was crisp and the ice cream hard There was sponge cake thick light
with sugar freckles on the dark crust The coffee was perfect and almost
burned the tongue

I dont understand about the heat and cold she said and they showed
her the asbestoslined compartments and perfectly fitting places for
each dish and plate Everything went back out of sight small leavings
in a special drawer knives and forks held firmly by rubber fittings
nothing that shook or rattled And the case was set back by the door
where the man called for it at eight oclock

She doesnt furnish table linen

No there are Japanese napkins at the top here We like our own
napkins and we didnt use a cloth anyway

And how about silver

We put ours away This plated ware they furnish is perfectly good We
could use ours of course if we wanted to wash it Some do that and some
have their own case marked and their own silver in it but its a good
deal of risk I think though they are extremely careful

Mrs Ree experienced peculiarly mixed feelings As far as food went she
had never eaten a better dinner But her sense of Domestic Aesthetics
was jarred

It certainly tastes good she said Delicious in fact I am
extremely obliged to you Mrs Porne Id no idea it could be sent so
far and be so good And only five dollars a week you say

For each person yes

I dont see how she does it All those cases and dishes and the
delivery wagon

That was the universal comment in Orchardina circles as the months
passed and Union House continued in existenceI dont see how she does
it




CHAPTER XII LIKE A BANYAN TREE


 The EarthPlants spring up from beneath
 The AirPlants swing down from above
 But the Banyan trees grow
 Both above and below
 And one makes a prosperous grove


In the fleeting opportunities offered by the Caffeteria and in longer
moments rather neatly planned for with some remnants of an earlier
ingenuity Mr Thaddler contrived to become acquainted with Mrs Bell
Diantha never quite liked him but he won her mothers heart by frank
praise of the girl and her ventures

I never saw a smarter woman in my life he said and no airs I tell
you maam if there was more like her this world would be an easier
place to live in and I can see she owes it all to you maam

This the mother would never admit for a moment but expatiated loyally
on the scientific mind of Mr Henderson Bell still of Jopalez

I dont see how he can bear to let her out of his sight said Mr
Thaddler

Of course he hated to let her go replied the lady We both did But
he is very proud of her now

I guess theres somebody else whos proud of her too he suggested
Excuse me maam I dont mean to intrude but we know there must be a
good reason for your daughter keeping all Orchardina at a distance Why
she could have married six times over in her first year here

She does not wish to give up her work Mrs Bell explained

Of course not and why should she Nice womanly business I am sure
I hope nobodyd expect a girl who can keep house for a whole township to
settle down to bossing one man and a hired girl

In course of time he got a pretty clear notion of how matters stood and
meditated upon it seriously rolling his big cigar about between pursed
lips Mr Thaddler was a good deal of a gossip but this he kept to
himself and did what he could to enlarge the patronage of Union House

The business grew It held its own in spite of fluctuations and after
a certain point began to spread steadily Mrs Bells coming and Mr
Eltwoods ardent championship together with Mr Thaddlers quieted
the dangerous slanders which had imperilled the place at one time They
lingered subterraneously of course People never forget slanders A
score of years after there were to be found in Orchardina folk who still
whispered about dark allegations concerning Union House and the papers
had done some pretty serious damage but the fame of good food good
service cheapness and efficiency made steady headway

In view of the increase and of the plans still working in her mind
Diantha made certain propositions to Mr Porne and also to Mrs Porne
in regard to a new specially built clubhouse for the girls

I have proved what they can do with me to manage them and want now
to prove that they can do it themselves with any matron competent
to follow my directions The house need not be so expensive one big
diningroom with turnup tables like those ironingboard seattables
you knowthen they can dance there Small reception room and office
hall kitchen and laundry and thirty bedrooms forty by thirty with an
ell for the laundry ought to do it oughtnt it

Mrs Porne agreed to make plans and did so most successfully and Mr
Porne found small difficulty in persuading an investor to put up such a
house which visibly could be used as a boardinghouse or small hotel
if it failed in its first purpose

It was built of concrete a plain simple structure but fine in
proportions and pleasantly colored

Diantha kept her plans to herself as usual but they grew so fast that
she felt a species of terror sometimes lest the ice break somewhere

Steady now she would say This is real business just plain
business Theres no reason why I shouldnt succeed as well as Fred
Harvey I will succeed I am succeeding

She kept well she worked hard she was more than glad to have her
mother with her but she wanted something else which seemed farther off
than ever Her lovers picture hung on the wall of her bedroom stood on
her bureau and but this was a secret a small one was carried in her
bosom

Rather a grim looking young woman Diantha with the cares of the world
of housekeepers upon her proud young shoulders with all the stirring
hopes to be kept within bounds all the skulking fears to be resisted
and the growing burden of a large affair to be carried steadily

But when she woke in the brilliant California mornings she would lie
still a few moments looking at the face on the wall and the face on the
bureau would draw the little picture out from under her pillow and kiss
it would say to herself for the thousandth time It is for him too

She missed him always

The very vigor of her general attitude the continued strength with
which she met the days and carried them made it all the more needful
for her to have some one with whom she could forget every care every
purpose every effort some one who would put strong arms around her and
call her Little Girl His letters were both a comfort and a pain He
was loyal kind loving but always that wall of disapproval He loved
her he did not love her work

She read them over and over hunting anew for the tender phrases the
things which seemed most to feed and comfort her She suffered not only
from her loneliness but from his and most keenly from his sternly
suppressed longing for freedom and the work that belonged to him

Why cant he see she would say to herself that if this succeeds he
can do his work that I can make it possible for him And he wont let
me He wont take it from me Why are men so proud Is there anything
so ignominious about a woman that it is disgraceful to let one help you
And why cant he think at all about the others Its not just us its
all people If this works men will have easier times as well as women
Everybody can do their real work better with this old primitive business
once set right

And then it was always time to get up or time to go to bed or time to
attend to some of the numberless details of her affairs

She and her mother had an early lunch before the caffeteria opened and
were glad of the afternoon tea often held in a retired corner of
the broad piazza She sat there one hot dusty afternoon alone and
unusually tired The asphalted street was glaring and noisy the cross
street deep in soft dust for months unwet

Failure had not discouraged her but increasing success with all its
stimulus and satisfaction called for more and more power Her mind was
busy foreseeing arranging providing for emergencies and then the
whole thing slipped away from her she dropped her head upon her arm for
a moment on the edge of the tea table and wished for Ross

From down the street and up the street at this moment two men were
coming both young both tall both good looking both apparently
approaching Union House One of them was the nearer and his foot soon
sounded on the wooden step The other stopped and looked in a shop
window

Diantha started up came forwardit was Mr Eltwood She had a vague
sense of disappointment but received him cordially He stood there
his hat off holding her hand for a long moment and gazing at her
with evident admiration They turned and sat down in the shadow of the
reedcurtained corner

The man at the shop window turned too and went away

Mr Eltwood had been a warm friend and cordial supporter from the epoch
of the Clubsplitting speech He had helped materially in the slow
uphill days of the girls effort with faith and kind words He had
met the mothers coming with most friendly advances and Mrs Bell found
herself much at home in his liberal little church

Diantha had grown to like and trust him much

Whats this about the new house Miss Bell Your mother says I may
know

Why not she said You have followed this thing from the first Sugar
or lemon You see I want to disentangle the undertakings set them upon
their own separate feet and establish the practical working of each
one

I see he said and day service is not cooked food delivery

Nor yet rooms for entertainment she agreed Weve got them all
labelled mother and I Theres the d s and c f d and r f
e and the p p Thats picnics and parties And more coming

What more yet Youll kill yourself Miss Bell Dont go too fast You
are doing a great work for humanity Why not take a little more time

I want to do it as quickly as I can for reasons answered Diantha

Mr Eltwood looked at her with tender understanding I dont want to
intrude any further than you are willing to want me he said but
sometimes I think that even youstrong as you arewould be better for
some help

She did not contradict him Her hands were in her lap her eyes on the
worn boards of the piazza floor She did not see a man pass on the other
side of the street cast a searching glance across and walk quickly on
again

If you were quite free to go on with your beautiful work said Mr
Eltwood slowly if you were offered heartiest appreciation profound
respect as well as love of course would you object to marrying Miss
Bell asked in an even voice as if it were a matter of metaphysical
inquiry Mrs Porne had told him of her theory as to a lover in the home
town wishing to save him a long heart ache but he was not sure of it
and he wanted to be

Diantha glanced quickly at him and felt the emotion under his quiet
words She withdrew her eyes looking quite the other way

You are enough of a friend to know Mr Eltwood she said I rather
thought you did know I am engaged

Thank you for telling me some one is greatly to be congratulated
he spoke sincerely and talked quietly on about less personal matters
holding his tea untasted till it was cold

Do let me give you some that is hot she said at last and let me
thank you from my heart for the help and strength and comfort you have
been to me Mr Eltwood

Im very glad he said and again I am very glad You may count
upon anything I can do for you always he continued I am proud to be
your friend

He held her hand once more for a moment and went away with his head up
and a firm step To one who watched him go he had almost a triumphant
air but it was not triumph only the brave beginning of a hard fight
and a long one

Then came Mrs Bell returned from a shopping trip and sank down in a
wicker rocker glad of the shade and a cup of tea No she didnt want
it iced Hot tea makes you cooler was her theory

You dont look very tired said the girl Seems to me you get
stronger all the time

I do said her mother You dont realize you cant realize Diantha
what this means to me Of course to you I am an old woman a back
numberone has to feel so about ones mother I did when I married and
my mother then was five years younger than I am now

I dont think you old mother not a bit of it You ought to have
twenty or thirty years of life before you real life

Thats just what Im feeling said Mrs Bell as if Id just begun to
live This is so _different_ There is a big moving thing to work for
There iswhy Diantha you wouldnt believe what a comfort it is to me
to feel that my work here isreallyadding to the profits

Diantha laughed aloud

You dear old darling she said I should think it was It is _making_
the profits

And it grows so her mother went on Heres this part so well assured
that youre setting up the new Union House Are you _sure_ about Mrs
Jessup dear

As sure as I can be of any one till Ive tried a long time She has
done all Ive asked her to here and done it well Besides I mean to
keep a hand on it for a year or two yetI cant afford to have that
fail

Mrs Jessup was an imported aunt belonging to one of the cleverest
girls and Diantha had had her in training for some weeks

Well I guess shes as good as any youd be likely to get Mrs Bell
admitted and we mustnt expect paragons If this cant be done by an
average bunch of working women the world over it cant be donethats
all

It can be done said the girl calmly It will be done You see

Mr Thaddler says you could run any kind of a business you set your
hand to her mother went on He has a profound respect for your
abilities Dina

Seems to me you and Mr Thaddler have a good deal to say to each
other motherkins I believe you enjoy that caffeteria desk and all the
compliments you get

I do said Mrs Bell stoutly I do indeed Why I havent seen so
many men to speak to sincewhy never in my life And they are very
amusingsome of them They like to come herelike it immensely And I
dont wonder I believe youll do well to enlarge

Then they plunged into a discussion of the winters plans The day
service department and its employment agency was to go on at the New
Union House with Mrs Jessup as manager the present establishment was
to be run as a hotel and restaurant and the depot for the cooked food
delivery

Mrs Thorvald and her husband were installed by themselves in another
new venture a small laundry outside the town This place employed
several girls steadily and the motor wagon found a new use between
meals in collecting and delivering laundry parcels

It simplifies it a lotto get the washing out of the place and the
girls off my mind said Diantha Now I mean to buckle down and learn
the hotel businessthoroughly and develop this cooked food delivery to
perfection

Modest young lady smiled her mother Where do you mean to stopif
ever

I dont mean to stop till Im dead Diantha answered but I dont
mean to undertake any more trades if that is what you mean You know
what Im afterto get housework on a business basis thats all and
prove prove PROVE what a good business it is Theres the cleaning
branchthats all started and going well in the day service Theres
the washingthats simple and easy Laundry works no mystery But
the food part is a big thing Its an art a science a business and
a handicraft I had the handicraft to start with Im learning the
business but Ive got a lot to learn yet in the science and art of it


Dont do too much at once her mother urged Youve got to cater to
people as they are

I know it the girl agreed They must be led step by stepthe
natural method Its a big job but not too big Out of all the women
who have done housework for so many ages surely its not too much to
expect one to have a special genius for it

Her mother gazed at her with loving admiration

Thats just what you have Dinaa special genius for housework I wish
there were more of you

There are plenty of me mother dear only they havent come out As
soon as I show em how to make the thing pay youll find that we have
a big percentage of this kind of ability Its all buried now in the
occasional perfect housekeeper

But they wont leave their husbands Dina

They dont need to the girl answered cheerfully Some of them
arent married yet some of them have lost their husbands and _some_
of themshe said this a little bitterlyhave husbands who will be
willing to let their wives grow

Not many Im afraid said Mrs Bell also with some gloom

Diantha lightened up again Anyhow here you are mother dear And
for this year I propose that you assume the financial management of the
whole business at a salary of 1000 and found How does that suit
you

Mrs Bell looked at her unbelievingly

You cant afford it Dina

Oh yes I canyou know I can because youve got the accounts Im
going to make big money this year

But youll need it This hotel and restaurant business may not do
well

Now mother you _know_ were doing well Look here And Diantha
produced her notebook

Heres the little laundry place its fittings come to so much wages
so much collection and delivery so much supplies so muchand already
enough patronage engaged to cover It will be bigger in winter a lot
with transients and this hotel to fall back on ought to clear at least
a thousand a year The service club dont pay me anything of course
that is for the girls benefit but the food delivery is doing better
than I dared hope

Mrs Bell knew the figures better than Diantha even and they went over
them carefully again If the winters patronage held on to equal the
summersand the many transient residents ought to increase itthey
would have an average of twenty families a week to provide forone
hundred persons

The expenses were


 Food for 100 at 250 a week Per capita 600
  per year 13000

 Labordelivery man 600
 Head cook 600
 Two assistant cooks 1040
 Three washers and packers 1560
 Office girl 520
  Per year 4320

 Rent kitchen office etc 500
 Rent of motor 300
 Rent of cases 250
 Gasolene and repairs 630
  Per year 1680

 Total 19000


How do you make the gasolene and repairs as much as that asked Mrs
Bell

Its margin mothermakes it even money It wont be so much
probably

The income was simple and sufficient They charged 500 a week per
capita for three meals table dhote delivered thrice daily Frequent
orders for extra meals really gave them more than they set down but the
hundredperson estimate amounted to 26000 a year

Now see said Diantha triumphantly subtract all that expense list
and it is a liberal one and we have 7000 left I can buy the car
and the cases this year and have 1600 over More because if I do buy
them I can leave off some of the interest and the rent of kitchen and
office comes to Union House Then theres all of the extra orders Its
going to pay splendidly mother It clears 70 a year per person Next
year it will clear a lot more

It did not take long to make Mrs Bell admit that if the business went
on as it had been going Diantha would be able to pay her a salary of
a thousand dollars and have five hundred leftfrom the food business
alone

There remained the hotel with large possibilities The present simple
furnishings were to be moved over to New Union House and paid for by
the girls in due time With new paint paper and furniture the old
house would make a very comfortable place

Of course its the restaurant mainlythese big kitchens and the
central location are the main thing The guests will be mostly tourists
I suppose

Diantha dwelt upon the prospect at some length and even her cautious
mother had to admit that unless there was some setback the year had a
prospect of large success

How about all this new furnishing Mrs Bell said suddenly How do
you cover that Take what youve got ahead now

Yes theres plenty said Diantha You see there is all Union House
has made and this summers profit on the cooked foodits plenty

Then you cant pay for the motor and cases as you planned her mother
insisted

No not unless the hotel and restaurant pays enough to make good But
I dont _have_ to buy them the first year If I dont there is 5500
leeway

Yes you are safe enough theres over 4000 in the bank now Mrs
Bell admitted But child she said suddenly your father

Yes Ive thought of father said the girl and I mean to ask him to
come and live at the hotel I think hed like it He could meet people
and talk about his ideas and Im sure Id like to have him

They talked much and long about this till the evening settled about
them till they had their quiet supper and the girls came home to their
noisy one and late that evening when all was still again Diantha came
to the dim piazza corner once more and sat there quite alone

Full of hope full of courage sure of her progressand aching with
loneliness

She sat with her head in her hands and to her ears came suddenly the
sound of a familiar stepa wellknown voicethe hands and the lips of
her lover

Diantha He held her close

Oh Ross Ross Darling Is it true When did you come Oh Im so
glad So _glad_ to see you

She was so glad that she had to cry a little on his shoulder which he
seemed to thoroughly enjoy

Ive good news for you little girl he said Good news at last
Listen dear dont cry Theres an end in sight A man has bought out
my shop The incubus is offI can _live_ now

He held his head up in a fine triumph and she watched him adoringly

Did youwas it profitable she asked

Its all exchange and some cash to boot Just think You know what
Ive wanted so longa ranch A big one that would keep us all and let
me go on with my work And dearIve got it Its a big fruit ranch
with its own waterthink of that And a vegetable garden too and
small fruit and everything And whats better its all in good
running order with a competent ranchman and two Chinese who rent the
vegetable part And there are two houses on it_two_ One for mother
and the girls and one for us

Dianthas heart stirred suddenly

Where is it dear she whispered

He laughed joyfully Its _here_ he said About eight miles or so
out up by the mountains has a little canyon of its ownits own little
stream and reservoir Oh my darling My darling

They sat in happy silence in the perfumed night The strong arms were
around her the big shoulder to lean on the dear voice to call her
little girl

The year of separation vanished from their thoughts and the long years
of companionship opened bright and glorious before them

I came this afternoon he said at length but I saw another man
coming He got here first I thought

Ross You didnt And youve left me to go without you all these
hours

He looked so confident when he went away that I was jealous Ross
admitted furiously jealous And then your mother was here and then
those cackling girls I wanted youalone

And then he had her alone for other quiet happy moments She was so
glad of him Her hold upon his hand upon his coat was tight

I dont know how Ive lived without you she said softly

Nor I said he I havent lived It isnt lifewithout you Well
dearest it neednt be much longer We closed the deal this afternoon I
came down here to see the place andincidentallyto see you

More silence

I shall turn over the store at once It wont take long to move and
settle theres enough money over to do that And the ranch pays
Diantha It really _pays_ and will carry us all How long will it take
you to get out of this

Get out ofwhat she faltered

Why the whole abominable business youre so deep in here Thank God
theres no shadow of need for it any more

The girls face went white but he could not see it She would not
believe him

Why dear she said if your ranch is as near as that it would be
perfectly easy for me to come in to the businesswith a car I can
afford a car soon

But I tell you theres no need any more said he Dont you
understand This is a paying fruit ranch with land rented to advantage
and a competent manager right there running it Its simply changed
owners Im the owner now Theres two or three thousand a year to be
made on ithas been made on it There is a home for my peoplea home
for us Oh my beloved girl My darling My own sweetheart Surely you
wont refuse me now

Dianthas head swam dizzily

Ross she urged you dont understand Ive built up a good business
herea real successful business Mother is in it fathers to come
down there is a big patronage it grows I cant give it up

Not for me Not when I can offer you a home at last Not when I show
you that there is no longer any need of your earning money he said
hotly

But deardear she protested It isnt for the money it is the
work I want to doit is my work You are so happy now that you can do
your workat last This is mine

When he spoke again his voice was low and stern

Do you mean that you loveyour workbetter than you love me

No It isnt that Thats not fair cried the girl Do you love your
work better than you love me Of course not You love both So do I
Cant you see Why should I have to give up anything

You do not have to he said patiently I cannot compel you to marry
me But now when at lastafter these awful yearsI can really offer
you a homeyou refuse

I have not refused she said slowly

His voice lightened again

Ah dearest And you will not You will marry me

I will marry you Ross

And when When dearest

As soon as you are ready

Butcan you drop this at once

I shall not drop it

Her voice was low very low but clear and steady

He rose to his feet with a muffled exclamation and walked the length of
the piazza and back

Do you realize that you are saying no to me Diantha

You are mistaken dear I have said that I will marry you whenever you
choose But it is you who are saying I will not marry a woman with a
business

This is foolishness he said sharply No manthat is a manwould
marry a woman and let her run a business

You are mistaken she answered One of the finest men I ever knew has
asked me to marry himand keep on with my work

Why didnt you take him up

Because I didnt love him She stopped a sob in her voice and he
caught her in his arms again

It was late indeed when he went away walking swiftly with a black
rebellion in his heart and Diantha dragged herself to bed

She was stunned deadened exhausted torn with a desire to run after
him and give upgive up anything to hold his love But something
partly reason and partly pride kept saying within her I have not
refused him he has refused me




CHAPTER XIII ALL THIS


 They laid before her conquering feet
 The spoils of many lands
 Their crowns shone red upon her head
 Their scepters in her hands

 She heard two murmuring at night
 Where rosesweet shadows rest
 And coveted the blossom red
 He laid upon her breast


When Madam Weatherstone shook the plentiful dust of Orchardina from
her expensive shoes and returned to adorn the more classic groves of
Philadelphia Mrs Thaddler assumed to hold undisputed sway as a social
leader

The Social Leader she meant to be and marshalled her forces to that
end She Patronized here and Donated there revised her visiting list
with rigid exclusiveness secured an Eminent Professor and a
Noted Writer as visitors and gave entertainments of almost Roman
magnificence

Her husband grew more and more restive under the rising tide of social
exactions in dress and deportment and spent more and more time behind
his fast horses or on the stockranch where he raised them As a
neighbor and fellow ranchman he scraped acquaintance with Ross Warden
and was able to render him many small services in the process of
settling

Mrs Warden remembered his visit to Jopalez and it took her some time
to rearrange him in her mind as a person of wealth and standing Having
so rearranged him on sufficient evidence she and her daughters became
most friendly and had hopes of establishing valuable acquaintance in
the town Its not for myself I care she would explain to Ross
every day in the week and more on Sundays but for the girls In that
dreadful Jopalez there was absolutely _no_ opportunity for them but
here with horses there is no reason we should not have friends You
must consider your sisters Ross Do be more cordial to Mr Thaddler

But Ross could not at present be cordial to anybody His unexpected good
fortune the freedom from hated cares and chance to work out his mighty
theories on the faithful guineapig ought to have filled his soul with
joy but Dianthas cruel obstinacy had embittered his cup of joy He
could not break with her she had not refused him and it was difficult
in cold blood to refuse her

He had stayed away for two whole weeks in which time the guineapigs
nibbled at ease and Dianthas work would have suffered except for her
mothers extra efforts Then he went to see her again miserable but
stubborn finding her also miserable and also stubborn They argued till
there was grave danger of an absolute break between them then dropped
the subject by mutual agreement and spent evenings of unsatisfying
effort to talk about other things

Diantha and her mother called on Mrs Warden of course admiring the
glorious view the sweet high air and the embowered loveliness of the
two ranch houses Ross drew Diantha aside and showed her theirsa
lovely little wideporched concrete cottage with a redtiled roof and
heavy masses of Gold of Ophir and Banksia roses

He held her hand and drew her close to him

He kissed her when they were safe inside and murmured Come
darlingwont you come and be my wife

I will Rosswhenever you saybut She would not agree to give up
her work and he flung away from her in reckless despair Mrs Warden
and the girls returned the call as a matter of duty but came no more
the mother saying that she could not take her daughters to a Servant
Girls Club

And though the Servant Girls Club was soon removed to its new quarters
and Union House became a quiet wellconducted hotel still the two
families saw but little of each other

Mrs Warden naturally took her sons side and considered Diantha an
unnatural monster of hardheartedness

The matter sifted through to the ears of Mrs Thaddler who rejoiced in
it and called upon Mrs Warden in her largest automobile As a mother
with four marriageable daughters Mrs Warden was delighted to accept
and improve the acquaintance but her aristocratic Southern soul was
inwardly rebellious at the ancestorlessness and uncultured moneyed pride
of her new friend

If only Madam Weatherstone had stayed she would complain to her
daughters She had Family as well as Wealth

Theres young Mrs Weatherstone mother suggested Dora

A nobody her mother replied She has the Weatherstone money of
course but no Position and what little she has she is losing by
her low tastes She goes about freely with Diantha Bellher own
housekeeper

Shes not her housekeeper now mother

Well its all the same She _was_ And a mere general servant before
that And now to think that when Ross is willing to overlook it all and
marry her she wont give it up

They were all agreed on this point unless perhaps that the youngest had
her inward reservations Dora had always liked Diantha better than had
the others

Young Mrs Weatherstone stayed in her big empty house for a while and
as Mrs Warden said went about frequently with Diantha Bell She liked
Mrs Bell tootook her for long stimulating rides in her comfortable
car and insisted that first one and then the other of them should have
a bit of vacation at her seashore home before the winters work grew too
heavy

With Mrs Bell she talked much of how Diantha had helped the town

She has no idea of the psychic effects Mrs Bell said she She
sees the business and she has a great view of all it is going to do
for women to come but I dont think she realizes how much she is
doing right now for women hereand men too There were my friends
the Pornes they were drifting apart as the novels have itand no
wonder Isabel was absolutely no good as a housekeeper he naturally
didnt like itand the baby made it all the worse she pined for her
work you see and couldnt get any time for it Now they are as happy
as can beand its just Diantha Bells doings The housework is off
Isabels shoulders

Then there are the Wagrams and the Sheldons and the Brinksand ever
so many morewho have told me themselves that they are far happier than
they ever were beforeand can live more cheaply She ought to be the
happiest girl alive

Mrs Bell would agree to this and quite swelled with happiness and
pride but Mrs Weatherstone watching narrowly was not satisfied

When she had Diantha with her she opened fire direct You ought to be
the happiest proudest most triumphant woman in the world she said
Youre making oodles of money your whole things going well and look
at your mothershes made over

Diantha smiled and said she was happy but her eyes would stray off to
the very rim of the ocean her mouth set in patient lines that were not
in the least triumphant

Tell me about it my friend said her hostess Is it that he wont
let you keep on with the business

Diantha nodded

And you wont give it up to marry him

No said Diantha No Why should I Id marry himtomorrow She
held one hand with the other tight but they both shook a little Id
be glad to But I will not give up my work

You look thin said Mrs Weatherstone

Yes

Do you sleep well

Nonot very

And I can see that you dont eat as you ought to Hm Are you going to
break down

No said Diantha I am not going to break down I am doing what is
right and I shall go on Its a little hard at firsthaving him so
near But I am young and strong and have a great deal to doI shall do
it

And then Mrs Weatherstone would tell her all she knew of the intense
satisfaction of the people she served and pleasant stories about the
girls She bought her books to read and such gleanings as she found in
foreign magazines on the subject of organized houseservice

Not only so but she supplied the Orchardina library with a special
bibliography on the subject and induced the new Womans Club to take
up a course of reading in it so that there gradually filtered into the
Orchardina mind a faint perception that this was not the freak of an
eccentric individual but part of an inevitable business development
going on in various ways in many nations

As the winter drew on Mrs Weatherstone whisked away again but kept a
warm current of interest in Dianthas life by many letters

Mr Bell came down from Jopalez with outer reluctance but inner
satisfaction He had rented his place and Susie had three babies now
Henderson Jr had no place for him and to do housework for himself
was no part of Mr Bells plan

In Dianthas hotel he had a comfortable room next his wifes and a
capacious chair in the firelit hall in wet weather or on the shaded
piazza in dry The excellent library was a resource to him he found
some congenial souls to talk with and under the new stimulus succeeded
at last in patenting a small device that really worked With this and
his rent he felt inclined to establish a home of his own and the
soul of Mrs Bell sank within her Without allowing it to come to an
issue between them she kept the question open for endless discussion
and Mr Bell lived on in great contentment under the impression that
he was about to move at almost any time To his friends and cronies he
dilated with pride on his daughters wonderful achievements

Shes as good as a boy he would declare Women nowadays seem to
do anything they want to And he rigidly paid his board bill with a
flourish

Meanwhile the impressive gatherings at Mrs Thaddlers and the
humbler tea and card parties of Dianthas friends had a new topic as a
shuttlecock

A New York company had bought one of the largest and finest blocks in
townthe old Para placeand was developing it in a manner hitherto
unseen The big shabby neglected estate began to turn into such
a fairyland as only southern lands can know The old liveoaks were
untouched the towering eucalyptus trees remained in ragged majesty but
an army of workmen was busy under guidance of a master of beauty

One large and lovely building rose promptly dubbed a hotel by the
unwilling neighbors others smaller showed here and there among the
trees and then a rosegray wall of concrete ran around the whole high
tantalizing with green boughs and sweet odors coming over it Those who
went in reported many buildings and much activity But when the wall
was done and each gate said No admittance except on business then
the work of genii was imagined and there was none to contradict

It was a School of Theosophy it was a Christian Science College it was
a FreeLove Colony it was a Secret Society it was a thousand wonders

Lot of little houses and one big one the employees said when
questioned

Hotel and cottages the employers said when questioned

They made no secret of it they were too busy but the town was
unsatisfied Why a wall What did any honest person want of a wall Yet
the wall cast a pleasant shadow there were seats here and there between
buttresses and as the swift California season advanced roses and
oleanders nodded over the top and gave hints of beauty and richness
more subtly stimulating than all the open glory of the lowhedged
gardens near

Dianthas soul was stirred with secret envy Some big concern was
about to carry out her dream or part of itperhaps to be a huge and
overflowing rival Her own work grew meantime and flourished as well as
she could wish

The fooddelivery service was running to its full capacity the girls
got on very well under Mrs Jessup and were delighted to have a house
of their own with the parlors and piazzas all to themselves and a
garden to sit in as well If this depleted their ranks by marriage it
did not matter now for there was a waiting list in training all the
time

Union House kept on evenly and profitably and Diantha was beginning to
feel safe and successful but the years looked long before her

She was always cheered by Mrs Weatherstones letters and Mrs Porne
came to see her and to compare notes over their friends success For
Mrs Weatherstone had been presented at Courtat more than one court
in fact and Mrs Weatherstone had been proposed to by a Dukeand had
refused him Orchardina wellnigh swooned when this was known

She had been studying investigating had become known in scientific as
well as social circles and on her way back the strenuous upper layer of
New York Society had also made much of her Rumors grew of her exquisite
costumes of her unusual jewels of her unique entertainments of her
popularity everywhere she went

Other proposals of a magnificent nature were reported with more
magnificent refusals and Orchardina began to be very proud of young
Mrs Weatherstone and to wish she would come back

She did at last bringing an Italian Prince with her and a Hoch
Geborene German Count also who alleged they were travelling to study
the country but who were reputed to have had a duel already on the
beautiful widows account

All this was longdrawn gossip but bore some faint resemblance to the
facts Viva Weatherstone at thirty was a very different woman front the
pale sadeyed girl of four years earlier And when the great house on
the avenue was arrayed in new magnificence and all Orchardinathat
daredhad paid its respects to her she opened the season as it were
with a brilliant dinner followed by a reception and ball

All Orchardina cameso far as it had been invited There was the
Prince sure enougha pleasant blueeyed young man And there was the
Count bearing visible evidence of duels aplenty in earlier days
And there was Diantha Bellreceiving with Mrs Porne and Mrs
Weatherstone All Orchardina stared Diantha had been at the
dinnerthat was clear And now she stood there in her soft dark
evening dress the knot of golden acacias nestling against the black
lace at her bosom looking as fair and sweet as if she had never had a
care in her life

Her mother thought her the most beautiful thing she had ever seen and
her father though somewhat critical secretly thought so too

Mrs Weatherstone cast many a loving look at the tall girl beside her
in the intervals of Delighted to see yous and saw that her double
burden had had no worse effect than to soften the lines of the mouth and
give a hint of pathos to the clear depths of her eyes

The foreign visitors were much interested in the young Amazon of
Industry as the Prince insisted on calling her and even the German
Count for a moment forgot his ancestors in her pleasant practical talk

Mrs Weatherstone had taken pains to call upon the Wardensclaiming a
connection if not a relationship and to invite them all And as
the crowd grew bigger and bigger Diantha saw Mrs Warden at last
approaching with her four daughtersand no one else She greeted them
politely and warmly but Mrs Weatherstone did more

Holding them all in a little group beside her she introduced her noble
visitors to them imparted the further information that their brother
was _fiance_ to Miss Bell I dont see him she said looking about
He will come later of course Ah Miss Madeline How proud you all
must feel of your sisterinlaw to be

Madeline blushed and tried to say she was

Such a remarkable young lady said the Count to Adeline You will
admire envy and imitate Is it not so

Your ladies of America have all things in your hands said the
Prince to Miss Cora To think that she has done so much and is yet so
youngand so beautiful

I know youre all as proud as you can be Mrs Weatherstone continued
to Dora You see Diantha has been heard of abroad

They all passed on presently as others came but Mrs Wardens head was
reeling She wished she could by any means get at Ross and _make_ him
come which he had refused to do

I cant mother he had said You goall of you Take the girls
Ill call for you at twelvebut I wont go in

Mr and Mrs Thaddler were therebut not happy She was not at least
and showed it he was not until an idea struck him He dodged softly
out and was soon flying off at dangerous speed over the moonwhite
country roads

He found Ross dressed and ready sulking blackly on his shadowy porch

Come and take a spin while you wait said Mr Thaddler

Thanks I have to go in town later

Ill take you in town

Thank you but I have to take the horses in and bring out my mother and
the girls

Ill bring you all out in the car Come onits a great night

So Ross rather reluctantly came

He sat back on the luxurious cushions his arms folded sternly his
brows knit and the stout gentleman at his side watched him shrewdly

How does the ranch go he asked

Very well thank you Mr Thaddler

Them Chinks pay up promptly

As prompt as the month comes round Their rent is a very valuable part
of the estate

Yes Mr Thaddler pursued They have a good steady market for their
stuff And the chicken man too Do you know who buys em

Ross did not Did not greatly care he intimated

I should think youd be interestedyou ought toits Diantha Bell

Ross started but said nothing

You see Ive taken a great interest in her proposition ever since she
sprung it on us Mr Thaddler confided Shes got the goods all right
But there was plenty against her hereyou know what women are And I
made up my mind the supplies should be good and steady anyhow She
had no trouble with her grocery orders that was easy Meat I couldnt
handleexcept indirectlya little pressure maybe here and there
And he chuckled softly But this ranch I bought on purpose

Ross turned as if he had been stung

You he said

Yes me Why not Its a good property I got it all fixed right and
then I bought your little upstate shoplock stock and barreland gave
you this for it A fair exchange is no robbery Though it would be nice
to have it all in the family eh

Ross was silent for a few turbulent moments revolving this far from
pleasing information

Whatd I do it for continued the unasked benefactor What do you
_think_ I did it for So that brave sweet little girl down here could
have her hearts desire Shes established her businessshes proved
her pointshes won the townmost of it and theres nothing on earth
to make her unhappy now but your pigheadedness Young man I tell you
youre a plumb fool

One cannot throw ones host out of his own swiftflying car nor is it
wise to jump out ones self

Nothing on earth between you but your cussed pride Mr Thaddler
remorselessly went on This ranch is honestly yoursby a square deal
Your Jopalez business was worth the moneyyou ran it honestly and
extended the trade Youd have made a heap by it if you could have
unbent a little Gosh I limbered up that store some in twelve months
And the stout man smiled reminiscently

Ross was still silent

And now youve got what you wantedthanks to her mind you thanks to
herand you aint willing to let her have what she wants

The young man moistened his lips to speak

You aint dependent on her in any senseI dont mean that You earned
the place all right and I dont doubt youll make good both in a
business way and a scientific way young man But why in Hades you
cant let her be happy too is moren I can figure Guess you get your
notions from two generations backand some

Ross began stumblingly I did not know I was indebted to you Mr
Thaddler

Youre not young man youre not I ran that shop of yours a
yearbuilt up the business and sold it for more than I paid for this
So youve no room for heroicsnone at all What I want you to realize
is that youre breaking the heart of the finest woman I ever saw You
cant bend that girlshell never give up A woman like that has got
more things to do than just marry But shes pining for you all the
same

Here she is tonight receiving with Mrs Weatherstonewith those
Bannerets Dukes and Earls around herstanding up there like a Princess
herselfand her eyes on the door all the timeand tears in em I
could swearbecause you dont come



They drew up with a fine curve before the carriage gate

Ill take em all homethey wont be ready for some time yet said
Mr Thaddler And if you two would like this car Ill send for the
other one

Ross shook hands with him You are very kind Mr Thaddler he said
I am obliged to you But I think we will walk

Tall and impressive looking more distinguished in a sixyearold
evening suit than even the Hoch Geborene in his uniform he came at
last and Diantha saw him the moment he entered saw too a new light
in his eyes

He went straight to her And Mrs Weatherstone did not lay it up against
him that he had but the briefest of words for his hostess

Will you come he said May I take you homenow

She went with him without a word and they walked slowly home by far
outlying paths and long waits on rosebowered seats they knew

The moon filled all the world with tender light and the orange blossoms
flooded the still air with sweetness

Dear said he I have been a proud foolI am yetbut I have come to
see a little clearer I do not approve of your workI cannot approve
of itbut will you forgive me for that and marry me I cannot live any
longer without you

Of course I will said Diantha




CHAPTER XIV AND HEAVEN BESIDE


They were married while the flowers were kneedeep over the sunny slopes
and mesas and the canyons gulfs of color and fragrance and went for
their first moon together to a far high mountain valley hidden among
wooded peaks with a clear lake for its central jewel

A month of heaven while wave on wave of perfect rest and
worldforgetting oblivion rolled over both their hearts

They swam together in the dawnflushed lake seeing the morning mists
float up from the silver surface breaking the still reflection of thick
trees and rosy clouds rejoicing in the level shafts of forest filtered
sunlight They played and ran like children rejoiced over their picnic
meals lay flat among the crowding flowers and slept under the tender
starlight

I dont see said her lover but that my strenuous Amazon is just as
much a woman asas any woman

Who ever said I wasnt quoth Diantha demurely

A month of perfect happiness It was so short it seemed but a moment
so long in its rich perfection that they both agreed if life brought no
further joy this was Enough

Then they came down from the mountains and began living



Day service is not so easily arranged on a ranch some miles from town
They tried it for a while the new runabout car bringing out a girl in
the morning early and taking Diantha in to her office

But motor cars are not infallible and if it met with any accident there
was delay at both ends and more or less friction

Then Diantha engaged a firstclass Oriental gentleman well recommended
by the vegetable Chinaman on their own place This was extremely
satisfactory he did the work well and was in all ways reliable
but there arose in the town a current of malicious criticism and
protestthat she did not live up to her principles

To this she paid no attention her work was now too well planted too
increasingly prosperous to be weakened by small sneers

Her mother growing plumper now thriving continuously in her new
lines of work kept the hotel under her immediate management and
did bookkeeping for the whole concern New Union Home ran itself and
articles were written about it in magazines so that here and there
in other cities similar clubs were started with varying success The
restaurant was increasingly popular Dianthas cooks were highly skilled
and handsomely paid and from the cheap lunch to the expensive banquet
they gave satisfaction

But the c f d was the darling of her heart and it prospered
exceedingly There is no advertisement like a pleased customer and
her pleased customers grew in numbers and in enthusiasm Family after
family learned to prize the cleanliness and quiet the odorlessness and
flylessness of a home without a kitchen and their questioning guests
were converted by the excellent of the meals

Critical women learned at last that a competent cook can really produce
better food than an incompetent one albeit without the sanctity of the
home

Sanctity of your bootstraps protested one irascible gentleman Such
talk is all nonsense I dont want _sacred_ mealsI want good onesand
Im getting them at last

We dont brag about home brewing any more said another or
home tailoring or home shoemaking Why all this talk about home
cooking

What pleased the men most was not only the good food but its clockwork
regularity and not only the reduced bills but the increased health and
happiness of their wives Domestic bliss increased in Orchardina and
the doctors were more rigidly confined to the patronage of tourists

Ross Warden did his best Under the merciless friendliness of Mr
Thaddler he had been brought to see that Diantha had a right to do this
if she would and that he had no right to prevent her but he did not
like it any the better

When she rolled away in her little car in the bright sweet mornings a
light went out of the day for him He wanted her there in the homehis
homehis wifeeven when he was not in it himself And in this
particular case it was harder than for most men because he was in the
house a good deal in his study with no better company than a polite
Chinaman some distance off

It was by no means easy for Diantha either To leave him tugged at
her heartstrings as it did at his and if he had to struggle with
inherited feelings and acquired traditions still more was she beset
with an unexpected uprising of sentiments and desires she had never
dreamed of feeling

With marriage love happiness came an overwhelming instinct of
servicepersonal service She wanted to wait on him loved to do it
regarded Wang Fu with positive jealousy when he brought in the coffee
and Ross praised it She had a sense of treason of neglected duty as
she left the flowercrowned cottage day by day

But she left it she plunged into her work she schooled herself
religiously

Shame on you she berated herself Now_now_ that youve got
everything on earthto weaken You could stand unhappiness cant you
stand happiness And she strove with herself and kept on with her
work

After all the happiness was presently diluted by the pressure of this
blank wall between them She came home eager loving delighted to
be with him again He received her with no complaint or criticism but
always an unspoken perhaps imagined sense of protest She was full of
loving enthusiasm about his work and he would dilate upon his harassed
guineapigs and their development with high satisfaction

But he never could bring himself to ask about her labors with any
genuine approval she was keenly sensitive to his dislike for the
subject and so it was ignored between them or treated by him in a vein
of humor with which he strove to cover his real feeling

When before many months were over the crowning triumph of her effort
revealed itself her joy and pride held this bitter drophe did not
sympathizedid not approve Still it was a great glory

The New York Company announced the completion of their work and the
_Hotel del las Casas_ was opened to public inspection House of the
Houses Thats a fine name said some disparagingly but at any
rate it seemed appropriate The big estate was one rich garden more
picturesque more dreamily beautiful than the American commercial mind
was usually able to compass even when possessed of millions The hotel
of itself was a pleasure palacewholly unostentatious full of gaiety
and charm offering lovely chambers for guests and residents and every
opportunity for healthful amusement There was the rare luxury of a big
swimmingpool there were billiard rooms card rooms reading rooms
lounging rooms and dancing rooms of satisfying extent

Outside there were tenniscourts badminton roque even croquet and
the wide roof was a garden of Babylon a Court of the Stars with views
of purple mountains fair wide valley and farflashing rim of sea
Around it each in its own hedged garden nestled Las Casasthe
Housestwenty in number with winding shaded paths groups of rare
trees a wilderness of flowers between and about them In one corner
was a playground for childrena wall around this that they might
shout in freedom and the nursery thereby gave every provision for the
happiness and safety of the little ones

The people poured along the winding walls entered the pretty cottages
were much impressed by a little flock of wellfloored tents in another
corner but came back with Ohs and Ahs of delight to the large
building in the Avenue

Diantha went all over the place inch by inch her eyes widening with
admiration Mr and Mrs Porne and Mrs Weatherstone with her She
enjoyed the serene wellplanned beauty of the whole approved heartily
of the cottages each one a little different each charming in its
quiet privacy admired the plentiful arrangements for pleasure and gay
association but her professional soul blazed with enthusiasm over the
great kitchens clean as a hospital glittering in glass and copper and
cool tiling with the swift sure electric stove

The fuel all went into a small solidly built power house and came out
in light and heat and force for the whole square

Diantha sighed in absolute appreciation

Fine isnt it said Mr Porne

How do you like the architecture asked Mrs Porne

What do you think of my investment said Mrs Weatherstone Diantha
stopped in her tracks and looked from one to the other of them

Fact I control the stockIm president of the Hotel del las Casas
Company Our friends here have stock in it too and more that you dont
know We think its going to be a paying concern But if you can make
it go my dear as I think you will you can buy us all out and own the
whole outfit

It took some time to explain all this but the facts were visible
enough

Nothing remarkable at all said Mrs Weatherstone Heres Astor with
three big hotels on his handswhy shouldnt I have one to play with
And Ive got to employ _somebody_ to manage it



Within a year of her marriage Diantha was at the head of this pleasing
Centre of Housekeeping She kept the hotel itself so that it was a joy
to all its patrons she kept the little houses homes of pure delight for
those who were so fortunate as to hold them and she kept up her c
f d business till it grew so large she had to have quite a fleet of
delivery wagons

Orchardina basked and prospered its citizens found their homes happier
and less expensive than ever before and its citizenesses began to wake
up and to do things worth while



Two years and there was a small Ross Warden born

She loved it nursed it and ran her business at long range for some
six months But then she brought nurse and child to the hotel with her
placed them in the cool airy nursery in the garden and varied her busy
day with still hours by herselfthe baby in her arms

Back they came together before supper and found unbroken joy and peace
in the quiet of home but always in the background was the current of
Ross unspoken disapproval

Three years four years

There were three babies now Diantha was a splendid woman of thirty
handsome and strong preeminently successfuland yet there were times
when she found it in her heart to envy the most ordinary people who
loved and quarreled and made up in the little outlying ranch houses
along the road they had nothing between them at least

Meantime in the friendly opportunities of Orchardina society added to
by the unexampled possibilities of Las Casas and they did not scorn
this hotel nor Dianthas position in it the three older Miss Wardens
had married Two of them preferred the good old way but one tried the
d s and the c f d and liked them well

Dora amazed and displeased her family as soon as she was of age by
frankly going over to Dianthas side and learning bookkeeping She
became an excellent accountant and bade fair to become an expert manager
soon

Ross had prospered in his work It may be that the element of
dissatisfaction in his married life spurred him on while the unusual
opportunities of his ranch allowed free effort He had always held that
the nontransmissability of acquired traits was not established by
any number of curtailed mice or cropeared rats A mutilation is not
an acquired trait he protested An acquired trait is one gained by
exercise it modifies the whole organism It must have an effect on the
race We expect the sons of a line of soldiers to inherit their fathers
courageperhaps his habit of obediencebut not his wooden leg

To establish his views he selected from a fine family of guineapigs two
pair set the one Pair A in conditions of ordinary guineapig bliss
and subjected the other Pair B to a course of discipline They were
trained to run They and their descendants after them pair following
on pair first with slowturning wheels as in squirrel cages the wheel
inexorably going machinedriven and the luckless little gluttons
having to move on for gradually increasing periods of time at
gradually increasing speeds Pair A and their progeny were sheltered
and fed but the rod was spared Pair B were as the guests at
Muldoonsthey had to exercise With scientific patience and
ingenuity he devised mechanical surroundings which made them jump
increasing spaces which made them run always a little faster and a
little farther and he kept a record as carefully as if these little
sheds were racing stables for a king

Several centuries of guineapig time went by generation after
generation of healthy guineapigs passed under his modifying hands
and after some five years he had in one small yard a fine group of the
descendants of his gallfed pair and in another the offspring of
the trained ones nimble swift as different from the first as the
razorbacked pig of the forest from the fatted porkers in the sty
He set them to racethe young untrained specimens of these distant
cousinsand the hare ran away from the tortoise completely

Great zoologists and biologists came to see him studied fingered
poked and examined the records argued and disbelievedand saw them
run

It is natural selection they said It profited them to run

Not at all said he They were fed and cared for alike with no gain
from running

It was artificial selection they said You picked out the speediest
for your training

Not at all said he I took always any healthy pair from the trained
parents and from the untrained onesquite late in life you understand
as guineapigs go

Anyhow there were the pigs and he took little specialized piglets
scarce weaned and pitted them against piglets of the untrained lotand
they outran them in a race for Mama Wherefore Mr Ross Warden found
himself famous of a sudden and all over the scientific world the
Wiesmanian controversy raged anew He was invited to deliver a lecture
before some most learned societies abroad and in several important
centers at home and went rejoicing

Diantha was glad for him from the bottom of her heart and proud of him
through and through She thoroughly appreciated his sturdy opposition to
such a weight of authority his long patience his careful steady work
She was left in full swing with her big business busy and successful
honored and liked by all the townpracticallyand quite independent of
the small fraction which still disapproved Some people always will She
was happy too in her babiesvery happy

The Hotel del las Casas was a triumph

Diantha owned it now and Mrs Weatherstone built others in other
places at a large profit

Mrs Warden went to live with Cora in the town Cora had more time to
entertain heras she was the one who profited by her sisterinlaws
general services

Diantha sat in friendly talk with Mrs Weatherstone one quiet day and
admitted that she had no cause for complaint

And yet said her friend

Young Mrs Warden smiled Theres no keeping anything from you is
there Yesyoure right Im not quite satisfied I suppose I ought not
to carebut you see I love him so I want him to _approve_ of menot
just put up with it and bear it I want him to _feel_ with meto care
It is awful to know that all this big life of mine is just a mistake to
himthat he condemns it in his heart

But you knew this from the beginning my dear didnt you

YesI knew itbut it is different now You know when you are
_married_

Mrs Weatherstone looked far away through the wide window I do know
she said

Diantha reached a strong hand to clasp her friends I wish I could
give it to you she said You have done so much for me So much You
have poured out your money like water

My money Well I like that said Mrs Weatherstone I have taken my
money out of five and seven per cent investments and put it into ten
per cent ones thats all Shall I never make you realize that I am a
richer woman because of you Diantha Bell Warden So dont try to be
gratefulI wont have it Your work has _paid_ rememberpaid me as
well as you and lots of other folks beside You know there are eighteen
good imitations of Union House running now in different cities and
three Las Casas all succeedingand the papers are talking about the
dangers of a Cooked Food Trust

They were friends old and tried and happy in mutual affection Diantha
had many now though none quite so dear Her parents were contentedher
brother and sister doing wellher children throve and grew and found
Mama a joy they never had enough of

Yet still in her heart of hearts she was not wholly happy



Then one night came by the last mail a thick letter from Rossthicker
than usual She opened it in her room alone their roomto which they
had come so joyously five years ago

He told her of his journeying his lectures his controversies and
triumphs rather brieflyand then

My darling I have learned something at last on my travels which
will interest you I fancy more than the potential speed of all the
guineapigs in the world and its transmissability

From what I hear about you in foreign lands from what I read about you
wherever I go and even more from what I see as a visitor in many
families I have at last begun to grasp the nature and importance of
your work

As a man of science I must accept any truth when it is once clearly
seen and though Ive been a long time about it I do see at last what
brave strong valuable work you have been doing for the world Doing it
scientifically too Your figures are quoted your records studied your
example followed You have established certain truths in the business of
living which are of importance to the race As a student I recognize and
appreciate your work As man to man Im proud of youtremendously proud
of you As your husband Ah my love I am coming back to youcoming
soon coming with my Whole Heart Yours Just wait My Darling till I
get back to you

Your Lover and Husband

Diantha held the letter close with hands that shook a little She
kissed itkissed it hard over and overnot improving its appearance
as a piece of polite correspondence

Then she gave way to an overmastering burst of feeling and knelt down
by the wide bed burying her face there the letter still held fast It
was a funny prayer if any human ear had heard it

Thank you was all she said with long deep sobbing sighs between
Thank youOthank you
