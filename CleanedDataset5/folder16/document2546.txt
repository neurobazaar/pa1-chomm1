BAR20

CHAPTER I Buckskin

The town lay sprawled over half a square mile of alkali plain its main
Street depressing in its width for those who were responsible for its
inception had worked with a generosity born of the knowledge that they
had at their immediate and unchallenged disposal the broad lands of
Texas and New Mexico on which to assemble a grand total of twenty
buildings four of which were of wood As this material was scarce and
had to be brought from where the waters of the Gulf lapped against the
flat coast the lastmentioned buildings were a matter of local pride
as indicating the progressiveness of their owners

These creations of hammer and saw were of one story crude and
unpainted their cheap weather sheathing warped and shrunken by the
pitiless sun curled back on itself and allowed unrestricted entrance to
alkali dust and air The other shacks were of adobe and reposed in that
magnificent squalor dear to their owners Indians and Mexicans

It was an incident of the Cattle Trail that most unique and stupendous
of all modern migrations and its founders must have been inspired with
a malicious desire to perpetrate a crime against geography or else they
reveled in a perverse cussedness for within a mile on every side lay
broad prairies and two miles to the east flowed the indolent waters of
the Rio Pecos itself The distance separating the town from the river
was excusable for at certain seasons of the year the placid stream
swelled mightily and swept down in a broad expanse of turbulent yellow
flood

Buckskin was a town of one hundred inhabitants located in the valley of
the Rio Pecos fifty miles south of the TexasNew Mexico line The
census claimed two hundred but it was a wellknown fact that it was
exaggerated One instance of this is shown by the name of Tom Flynn
Those who once knew Tom Flynn alias Johnny Redmond alias Bill Sweeney
alias Chuck Mullen by all four names could find them in the census
list Furthermore he had been shot and killed in the March of the
year preceding the census and now occupied a grave in the young but
flourishing cemetery Perrys Bend twenty miles up the river was
cognizant of this and other facts and laughing in open derision at
the padded list claimed to be the better town in all ways including
marksmanship

One year before this tale opens Buck Peters an example for the more
recent Billy the Kid had paid Perrys Bend a short but busy visit He
had ridden in at the north end of Main Street and out at the south As
he came in he was fired at by a group of ugly cowboys from a ranch known
as the C 80 He was hit twice but he unlimbered his artillery and
before his horse had carried him half dead out on the prairie he had
killed one of the group Several citizens had joined the cowboys
and added their bullets against Buck The deceased had been the best
bartender in the country and the rage of the suffering citizens can
well be imagined They swore vengeance on Buck his ranch and his
stamping ground

The difference between Buck and Billy the Kid is that the former never
shot a man who was not trying to shoot him or who had not been warned
by some action against Buck that would call for it He minded his own
business never picked a quarrel and was quiet and pacific up to
a certain point After that had been passed he became like a raging
cyclone in a tenement house and stormcellars were much in demand

Fanning is the name of a certain style of gun play not unknown among
the bad men of the West While Buck was not a bad man he had to rub
elbows with them frequently and he believed that the sauce for the
goose was the sauce for the gander So be bad removed the trigger of his
revolver and worked the hammer with the thumb of the gun hand or the
heel of the unencumbered hand The speed thus acquired was greater than
that of the more modern doubleaction weapon Six shots in a few seconds
was his average speed when that number was required and when it is
thoroughly understood that at least some of them found their intended
bullets it is not difficult to realize that fanning was an operation of
danger when Buck was doing it

He was a good rider as all cowboys are and was not afraid of anything
that lived At one time he and his chums Red Connors and Hopalong
Cassidy had successfully routed a band of fifteen Apaches who wanted
their scalps Of these twelve never hunted scalps again nor anything
else on this earth and the other three returned to their tribe with
the report that three evil Spirits had chased them with wheel guns
cannons

So now since his visit to Perrys Bend the rivalry of the two towns
had turned to hatred and an alert and eager readiness to increase the
inhabitants of each others graveyard A state of war existed which for
a time resulted in nothing worse than acrimonious suggestions But the
time came when the score was settled to the satisfaction of one side at
least

Four ranches were also concerned in the trouble Buckskin was surrounded
by two the Bar 20 and the Three Triangle Perrys Bend was the
common point for the C 80 and the Double Arrow Each of the two ranch
contingents accepted the feud as a matter of course and as a matter
of course took sides with their respective towns As no better class of
fighters ever lived the trouble assumed Homeric proportions and insured
a danger zone well worth watching

Bar20s northern line was C 80s southern one and Skinny Thompson took
his turn at outriding one morning after the seasons roundup He was to
follow the boundary and turn back stray cattle When he had covered the
greater part of his journey he saw Shorty Jones riding toward him on a
course parallel to his own and about long revolver range away Shorty
and he had crossed trails the year before and the best of feelings did
not exist between them

Shorty stopped and stared at Skinny who did likewise at Shorty Shorty
turned his mount around and applied the spurs thereby causing his
indignant horse to raise both heels at Skinny The latter took it all
in gravely and as Shorty faced him again placed his left thumb to his
nose wiggling his fingers suggestively Shorty took no apparent notice
of this but began to shout

Yu wants to keep yore busteddown cows on yore own side They was all
over us day afore yisterday Im goin to salt any more what comes over
and dont yu fergit it neither

Thompson wigwagged with his fingers again and shouted in reply Yu cn
salt all yu wants to but if I ketch yu adoin it yu wont have to work
no more An I kin say right here thet theys more C 80 cows over here
than theys Bar20s over there

Shorty reached for his revolver and yelled Yore a liar

Among the cowboys in particular and the Westerners in general at that
time the three suicidal terms unless one was an expert in drawing
quick and shooting straight with one movement were the words liar
coward and thief Any man who was called one of these in earnest
and he was the judge was expected to shoot if he could and save his
life for the words were seldom used without a gun coming with them The
movement of Shortys hand toward his belt before the appellation reached
him was enough for Skinny who let go at long rangeand missed


The two reports were as one Both urged their horses nearer and fired
again This time Skinnys sombrero gave a sharp jerk and a hole appeared
in the crown The third shot of Skinnys sent the horse of the other to
its knees and then over on its side Shorty very promptly crawled behind
it and as he did so Skinny began a wide circle firing at intervals as
Shortys smoke cleared away

Shorty had the best position for defense as he was in a shallow coule
but he knew that he could not leave it until his opponent had either
grown tired of the affair or had used up his ammunition Skinny knew it
too Skinny also knew that he could get back to the ranch house and lay
in a supply of food and ammunition and return before Shorty could cover
the twelve miles he had to go on foot

Finally Thompson began to head for home He had carried the matter as
far as he could without it being murder Too much time had elapsed now
and besides it was before breakfast and he was hungry He would go
away and settle the score at some time when they would be on equal
terms

He rode along the line for a mile and chanced to look back Two C 80
punchers were riding after him and as they saw him turn and discover
them they fired at him and yelled He rode on for some distance and
cautiously drew his rifle out of its long holster at his right leg
Suddenly he turned around in the saddle and fired twice One of his
pursuers fell forward on the neck of his horse and his comrade turned
to help him Thompson wigwagged again and rode on reaching the ranch
as the others were finishing their breakfast

At the table Red Connors remarked that the tardy one had a hole in his
sombrero and asked its owner how and where he had received it

Had a argument with C 80 outn th line

Go way Ventilate enny

One

Good boy sonny Hey Hopalong Skinny perforated C 80 this mawnin

Hopalong Cassidy was struggling with a mouthful of beef He turned his
eyes toward Red without ceasing and grinning as well as he could under
the circumstances managed to grunt out Gu which was as near to
Good as the beef would allow

Lanky Smith now chimed in as he repeatedly stuck his knife into a
reluctant boiled potato Howd yu do it Skinny

Bet he sneaked up on him joshed Buck Peters did yu ask his pardin
Skinny

Ask nuthin remarked Red he jest nachurly walks up to C 80 an sez
Kin I have the pleasure of ventilatin yu an C So he sez If yu do
it easy like sez he Didnt he Thompson

Theyll be some ventilatin under th table if yu fellows dont lemme
alone Im hungry complained Skinny

Say Hopalong I bets yu I kin clean up C 80 all by my lonesome
announced Buck winking at Red

Yah Yu onct tried to clean up the Bend Buckie an if Pete an Billy
hadnt afound yu when they come by Eagle Pass that night yu wouldnt be
here eatin beef by th pound glancing at the hardworking Hopalong
It was plum lucky fer yu that they was acourtin that time wasnt it
Hopalong suddenly asked Red Hopalong nearly strangled in his efforts
to speak He gave it up and nodded his head

Why cant yu git it straight Connors I wasnt doin no courtin it
was Pete I runned into him on th other side o th pass Id look fine
acourtin wouldnt I asked the downtrodden Williams

Pete Wilson skillfully flipped a potato into that worthys coffee
spilling the beverage of the questionable name over a large expanse of
blue flannel shirt Yus all right yu are Why when I meets yu yu
was lost in th arms of yore ladylove All I could see was yore feet Go
an git tangled up with a two hundred and forty pound halfbreed squaw
an then try to lay it onter me When I proposed drownin yore
troubles over at Cowans yu went an got mad over what yu called th
insinooation An yu shore didnt look any too blamed fine neither

All th same volunteered Thompson who had taken the edge from his
appetite we better go over an pay C 80 a call I dont like what
Shorty said about saltin our cattle Hell shore do it unless I camps
on th line which same I haint hankerin after

Oh he wouldnt stop th cows that way Skinny he was only afoolin
exclaimed Connors meekly

Foolin yore granmother That there bunchll do anything if we wasnt
lookin hotly replied Skinny

Thats shore nuff gospel Thomp Theys sore fer morn one thing They
got aplenty when Buck went on th warpath an theys hankerin to git
square remarked Johnny Nelson stealing the pie a rare treat of his
neighbor when that unfortunate individual was not looking He had
it halfway to his mouth when its former owner Jimmy Price a boy of
eighteen turned his head and saw it going

Hiyi Yu claybank coyote drap thet pie Did yu ever see such a
sonofagun fer pie he plaintively asked Red Connors as he grabbed
a mighty handful of apples and crust Piell kill yu some day yu
bobtailed jack I had an uncle that died onct He et too much pie an
he went an turned green an soll yu if yu dont let it alone

Yu oughtr seed th pie Johnny had down in Eagle Flat murmured Lanky
Smith reminiscently She had feet thatd stop a stampede Johnny
was shore loco about her Swore she was the finest blossom that
ever growed Here he choked and tears of laughter coursed down his
weatherbeaten face as he pictured her She was a dainty Mexican about
fifteen hans high an about sixteen hans around Johnny used to chalk
off when he hugged her usent yu Johnny One night when he had got
purty well around on th second lap he run inter a feller jest startin
out on his fust They haint caught that Mexican yet

Nelson was pelted with everything in sight He slowly wiped off the
pie crust and bread and potatoes Anybodyd think I was a busted grub
wagon he grumbled When he had fished the last piece of beef out of
his ear he went out and offered to stand treat As the roundup was
over they slid into their saddles and raced for Cowans saloon at
Buckskin



CHAPTER II The Rashness of Shorty

Buckskin was very hot in fact it was never anything else Few people
were on the streets and the town was quiet Over in the Houston hotel
a crowd of cowboys was lounging in the barroom They were very quieta
condition as rare as it was ominous Their mounts twelve in all were
switching flies from their quivering skins in the corral at the rear
Eight of these had a large C 80 branded on their flanks the other four
a Double Arrow

In the barroom a slim wiry man was looking out of the dirty window
up the street at Cowans saloon Shorty was complaining They shore
oughter be here now They rounded up last week The man nearest assured
him that they would come The man at the window turned and said Theys
yer now


In front of Cowans a crowd of nine happygolucky daredevil riders
were sliding from their saddles They threw their reins over the heads
of their mounts and filed in to the bar Laughter issued from the open
door and the clink of glasses could be heard They stood in picturesque
groups strong selfreliant humorous virile Their expensive
sombreros were pushed far back on their heads and their hairy chaps were
covered with the alkali dust from their ride

Cowan bottle in hand pushed out several more glasses He kicked a dog
from under his feet and looked at Buck Rounded up yet he inquired

Shore day afore yisterday came the reply The rest were busy
removing the dust from their throats and gradually drifted into groups
of two or three One of these groups strolled over to the solitary card
table and found Jimmy Price resting in a cheap chair his legs on the
table

I wisht yud extricate yore delicate feet from offn this hyar table
James humbly requested Lanky Smith morally backed up by those with
him

Yaas they shore is delicate Mr Smith responded Jimmy without
moving

We wants to play draw Jimmy explained Pete

Yore shore welcome to play if yu wants to Didnt I tell yu when yu
growed that mustache that yu didnt have to ask me any more queried
the placid James paternally

Call em off sonny Pete sez he kin clean me out Anyhow yu kin have
the fust deal compromised Lanky

Im shore sorry fer Pete if he caynt Yu dont reckon I has to have
fust deal to beat yu fellers do yu Go way an lemme alone I never
seed such a bunch fer buttin in as yu fellers

Billy Williams returned to the bar Then he walked along it until he
was behind the recalcitrant possessor of the table While his aggrieved
friends shuffled their feet uneasily to cover his approach he tiptoed
up behind Jimmy and with a nod grasped that indignant individual
firmly by the neck while the others grabbed his feet They carried him
twisting and bucking to the middle of the street and deposited him in
the dust returning to the now vacant table

Jimmy rested quietly for a few seconds and then slowly arose dusting
the alkali from him

Th walleyed piruts he muttered and then scratched his head for
a way to play hunk As he gazed sorrowfully at the saloon he heard a
snicker from behind him He thinking it was one of his late tormentors
paid no attention to it Then a cynical biting laugh stung him He
wheeled to see Shorty leaning against a tree a sneering leer on his
flushed face Shortys right hand was suspended above his holster
hooked to his belt by the thumba favorite position of his when
expecting trouble

One of yore reglar habits he drawled

Jimmy began to dust himself in silence but his lips were compressed to
a thin white line

Does they hurt yu pursued the onlooker

Jimmy looked up I heard tell that they make glue outen cayuses
sometimes he remarked

Shortys eyes flashed The loss of the horse had been rankling in his
heart all day

Does they git yu frequent he asked His voice sounded hard

Oh bout as frequent as yu lose a cayuse I reckon replied Jimmy
hotly

Shortys hand streaked to his holster and Jimmy followed his lead
Jimmys Colt was caught He had bucked too much As he fell Shorty ran
for the Houston House

Pistol shots were common for they were the universal method of
expressing emotions The poker players grinned thinking their victim
was letting off his indignation Lanky sized up his hand and remarked
half audibly Hes a shore good kid

The bartender fearing for his new beveled giltframed mirror gave a
hasty glance out the window He turned around made change and remarked
to Buck Yore kid Jimmy is plugged Several of the more credulous
craned their necks to see Buck being the first Judas he shouted
and ran out to where Jimmy lay coughing his toes twitching The saloon
was deserted and a crowd of angry cowboys surrounded their chumaboy
Buck had seen Shorty enter the door of the Houston House and he swore
Chase them C 80 and Arrow cayuses behind the saloon Pete an git
under cover

Jimmy was choking and he coughed up blood Hes shoregot me Mygun
stuck he added apologetically He tried to sit up but was not able
and he looked surprised Its purtydamn hotout here he suggested
Johnny and Billy carried him in the saloon and placed him by the table
in the chair he had previously vacated As they stood up he fell across
the table and died

Billy placed the dead boys sombrero on his head and laid the refractory
sixshooter on the table I wonder who th dirty killer was He looked
at the slim figure and started to go out followed by Johnny As he
reached the threshold a bullet zipped past him and thudded into the
frame of the door He backed away and looked surprised Thats Shortys
shootinhe allus misses bout that much He looked out and saw Buck
standing behind the live oak that Shorty had leaned against firing at
the hotel Turning around he made for the rear remarking to Johnny that
theys in th Houston Johnny looked at the quiet figure in the chair
and swore softly He followed Billy Cowan closing the door and taking
a buffalo gun from under the bar went out also and slammed the rear
door forcibly



CHAPTER III The Argument

Up the street two hundred yards from the Houston House Skinny and Pete
lay hidden behind a bowlder Three hundred yards on the other side of
the hotel Johnny and Billy were stretched out in an arroyo Buck was
lying down now and Hopalong from his position in the barn belonging to
the hotel was methodically dropping the horses of the besieged a job
he hated as much as he hated poison The corral was their death trap
Red and Lanky were emitting clouds of smoke from behind the store
immediately across the street from the barroom A buffalo gun roared
down by the plaza and several Sharps cracked a protest from different
points The town had awakened and the shots were dropping steadily

Strange noises filled the air They grew in tone and volume and then
dwindled away to nothing The hum of the buffalo gun and the sobbing
piinining of the Winchesters were liberally mixed with the sharp
whines of the revolvers

There were no windows in the hotel now Raw furrows in the bleached wood
showed yellow and splinters mysteriously sprang from the casings The
panels of the door were producing cracks and the cheap door handle
flew many ways at once An empty whisky keg on the stoop boomed out
mournfully at intervals and finally rolled down the steps with a
rumbling protest Wisps of smoke slowly climbed up the walls and seemed
to be waving defiance to the curling wisps in the open


Pete raised his shoulder to refill the magazine of his smoking rifle and
dropped the cartridges all over his lap He looked sheepishly at Skinny
and began to load with his other hand

Yore plum loco yu are Dont yu reckon they kin hit a blue shirt
at two hundred Skinny cynically inquired Got one that time he
announced a second later

I wonder whos got th buffalo grunted Pete Mus be Cowan he
replied to his own question and settled himself to use his left hand

Dont yu git Shorty hes my meat suggested Skinny

Yu better tell Buckhe aint got no love fer Shorty replied Pete
aiming carefully

The panic in the corral ceased and Hopalong was now sending his regrets
against the panels of the rear door He had cut his last initial in the
near panel and was starting a wobbly H in its neighbor He was in a
good position There were no windows in the rear wall and as the door
was a very dangerous place he was not fired at

He began to get tired of this onesided business and crawled up on the
window ledge dangling his feet on the outside He occasionally sent a
bullet at a different part of the door but amused himself by annoying
Buck

Plenty hot down there he pleasantly inquired and as he received no
answer he tried again Better save some of them cartridges fer some
other time Buck

Buck was sending 4570s into the shattered window with a precision that
presaged evil to any of the defenders who were rash enough to try to
gain the other end of the room

Hopalong bit off a chew of tobacco and drowned a green fly that was
crawling up the side of the barn The yellow liquid streaked downward a
short distance and was eagerly sucked up by the warped boards

A spurt of smoke leaped from the battered door and the bored Hopalong
promptly tumbled back inside He felt of his arm and then delighted
at the notice taken of his artistic efforts shot several times from
a crack on his right This yers shore gittin like home he gravely
remarked to the splinter that whizzed past his head He shot again at
the door and it sagged outward accompanied by the thud of a falling
body Pies like mother used to make he announced to the loft as he
slipped the magazine full of 4570S An pills like popper used to
take he continued when he had lowered the level of the water in his
flask

He rolled a cigarette and tossed the match into the air extinguishing
it by a shot from his Colt

Got any cigarettes Hoppy said a voice from below

Shore replied the joyous puncher recognizing Pete howd yu git
here

Like a cow Busy

None whatever Comin up

Nope Skinny wants a smoke too

Hopalong handed tobacco and papers down the hole So long

So long replied the daring Pete who risked death twice for a smoke

The hot afternoon dragged along and about three oclock Buck held up an
empty cartridge belt to the gaze of the curious Hopalong That observant
worthy nodded and threw a double handful of cartridges one by one to
the patient and unrelenting Buck who filled his gun and piled the few
remaining ones up at his side Th lives of mice and men gang aft all
wrong he remarked at random

Th sonofaguns talkin Shakespeare marveled Hopalong Satiate
any Buck he asked as that worthy settled down to await his chance

Two he replied Shorty an another Plenty damn hot down here he
complained A spurt of alkali dust stung his face but the hand that
made it never made another Three he called How many Hoppy

 One Thats four Wonder if th others got any

Pete said Skinny got one replied the intent Buck

Th sonofagun he never said nothin about it an me a fillin his
ornery paws with smokin Hopalong was indignant

Bet yu ten we dont git em afore dark he announced

Got yu Go yu ten more I gits another promptly responded Buck

Thats a shore cinch Make her twenty

She is

Yull have to square it with Skinny he shore wanted Shorty plum bad
Hopalong informed the unerring marksman

Why didnt he say suthin about it Anyhow Jimmy was my bunkie

Hopalongs cigarette disintegrated and the board at his left received
a hole He promptly disappeared and Buck laughed He sat up in the loft
and angrily spat the soaked paper out from between his lips

All that trouble fer nothin th whiteeyed coyote he muttered
Then he crawled around to one side and fired at the center of his C
Another shot hurtled at him and his left arm fell to his side Thats
funnywonder where th damn pirut is He looked out cautiously and saw
a cloud of smoke over a knothole which was situated close up under the
eaves of the barroom and it was being agitated Some one was blowing at
it to make it disappear He aimed very carefully at the knot and fired
He heard a sound between a curse and a squawk and was not molested any
further from that point

I knowed hed git hurt he explained to the bandage torn from the
edge of his kerchief which he carefully bound around his last wound

Down in the arroyo Johnny was complaining

This yers a no good bunk he plaintively remarked

It shore aintbut its th best we kin find apologized Billy

Thats th sixth that feller sent up there Hes a damn poor shot
observed Johnny must be Shorty

Shorty kin shoot plum goodtaint him contradicted Billy

Yaswith a sixshooter Hes offn his feed with a rifle explained
Johnny

Yu wants to stay down from up there yu ijit warned Billy as the
disgusted Johnny crawled up the bank He slid down again with a welt on
his neck

Thats somebody else now He oughter a done bettern that he said

Billy had fired as Johnny started to slide and he smoothed his aggrieved
chum He could onct yu means

Did yu git him asked the anxious Johnny rubbing his welt Plum
center responded the businesslike Billy Go up agin mebby I kin git
another he suggested tentatively

Mebby you kin go to blazes I aint no gallery grinned the now
exuberant owner of the welt

Whos got the buffalo he inquired as the great gun roared

Mus be Cowan Hes shore all right Sounds like a bloomin cannon
replied Billy Lemme alone with yore fool questions Im busy he
complained as his talkative partner started to ask another Go an git
me some waterIm alkalied An git some 45s mines purty near gone

Johnny crawled down the arroyo and reappeared at Hopalongs barn

As he entered the door a handful of empty shells fell on his hat and
dropped to the floor He shook his head and remarked That mus be that
fool Hopalong

Yore shore right Hows business inquired the festive Cassidy

Purty fair Billys got one How manys gone

Bucks got three I got two and Skinnys got one Thats six an Billy
is seven Theys five more he replied

Howd yu know queried Johnny as he filled his flask at the horse
trough

Because theys twelve cayuses behind the hotel Thats why

They might git away on em suggested the practical Johnny

Cant Theys all cashed in

Yu said that theys five left ejaculated the puzzled water carrier

Yah yore a smart cuss aint yu

Johnny grinned and then said Got any smokin Hopalong looked
grieved I aint no store Why dont yu git generous and buy some

He partially filled Johnnys hand and as he put the sadly depleted bag
away he inquired Got any papers

Nope

Got any matches he asked cynically

Nope

Kin yu smoke em he yelled indignantly

Shore nuff placidly replied the unruffled Johnny Billy wants some
4570s

Hopalong gasped Dont he want my gun too

Nope Got a better one Hurry up hell git mad Hopalong was a very
methodical person He was the only one of his crowd to carry a second
cartridge strap It hung over his right shoulder and rested on his
left hip His waist belt held thirty cartridges for the revolvers He
extracted twenty from that part of the shoulder strap hardest to get at
the back by simply pulling it over his shoulder and plucking out the
bullets as they came into reach

Thats all yu kin have Im Bucks ammernition jackass he explained
Bet yu ten we gits em afore darkhe was hedging

Any fool knows that Ill take yu if yu bets th other way responded
Johnny grinning He knew Hopalongs weak spot

Yore on promptly responded Hopalong who would bet on anything


Well so long said Johnny as he crawled away

Hey yu Johnny called out Hopalong dont yu go an tell anybody I
got any pills left I aint no arsnal

Johnny replied by elevating one foot and waving it Then he disappeared

Behind the store the most precarious position among the besiegers
Red Connors and Lanky Smith were ensconced and commanded a view of the
entire length of the barroom They could see the dark mass they knew to
be the rear door and derived a great amount of amusement from the spots
of light which were appearing in it

They watched the C reversed to them appear and be completed When
the wobbly H grew to completion they laughed heartily Then the
hardwood bar had been dragged across the field of vision and up to the
front windows and they could only see the indiscriminate holes which
appeared in the upper panels at frequent intervals

Every time they fired they had to expose a part of themselves to a
return shot with the result that Lankys forearm was seared its entire
length Red had been more fortunate and only had a bruised ear

They laboriously rolled several large rocks out in the open pushing
them beyond the shelter of the store with their rifles When they had
crawled behind them they each had another wound From their new position
they could see Hopalong sitting in his window He promptly waved his
sombrero and grinned

They were the most experienced fighters of all except Buck and were
saving their shots When they did shoot they always had some portion of
a mans body to aim at and the damage they inflicted was considerable
They said nothing being older than the rest and more taciturn and
they were not reckless Although Hopalongs antics made them laugh they
grumbled at his recklessness and were not tempted to emulate him It was
noticeable too that they shoved their rifles out simultaneously and
although both were aiming only one fired Lankys gun cracked so close
to the enemys that the whirr of the bullet over Reds head was merged
in the crack of his partners reply

When Hopalong saw the rocks roll out from behind the store he grew very
curious Then he saw a flash followed instantly by another from the
second rifle He saw several of these follow shots and could sit in
silence no longer He waved his hat to attract attention and then
shouted How many A shot was sent straight up in the air and he
notified Buck that there were only four left

The fire of these four grew less rapidthey were saving their
ammunition A pot shot at Hopalong sent that gentlemans rifle hurtling
to the ground Another tore through his hat removing a neat amount of
skin and hair and giving him a lifelong part He fell back inside
and proceeded to shoot fast and straight with his revolvers his head
burning as though on fire When he had vented the dangerous pressure
of his anger he went below and tried to fish the rifle in with a long
stick It was obdurate so he sent three more shots into the door and
receiving no reply ran out around the corner of his shelter and grasped
the weapon When half way back he sank to the ground Before another
shot could be fired at him with any judgment a ripping spitting rifle
was being frantically worked from the barn The bullets tore the door
into seams and gaps the lowest panel the one having the H in it
fell inward in chunks Johnny had returned for another smoke

Hopalong still grasping the rifle rolled rapidly around the corner of
the barn He endeavored to stand but could not Johnny hearing rapid
and fluent swearing came out

Whered they git yu he asked

 In th off leg Hurts like blazes Did yu git him

Nope I jest come fer another cig got any left

Up above Yore gall is shore apallin Help me in yu twolaigged
jackass

Shore Well shore pay our tentions to that door Shell go purty
soonshes as full of holes as th Bad Lans replied Johnny Git
aholt an hop along Hopalong

He helped the swearing Hopalong inside and then the lead they pumped
into the wrecked door was scandalous Another panel fell in and
Hopalongs C was destroyed A wide crack appeared in the one above it
and grew rapidly Its mate began to gape and finally both were driven
in The increase in the light caused by these openings allowed Red and
Lanky to secure better aim and soon the fire of the defenders died out

Johnny dropped his rifle and drawing his sixshooter ran out and
dashed for the dilapidated door while Hopalong covered that opening
with a fusilade

As Johnnys shoulder sent the framework flying inward he narrowly missed
sudden death As it was he staggered to the side out of range and
dropped full length to the ground flat on his face Hopalongs rifle
cracked incessantly but to no avail The man who had fired the shot was
dead Buck got him immediately after he had shot Johnny

Calling to Skinny and Red to cover him Buck sprinted to where Johnny
lay gasping The bullet had struck his shoulder Buck Colt in hand
leaped through the door but met with no resistance He signaled to
Hopalong who yelled Theys none left

The trees and rocks and gullies and buildings yielded men who soon
crowded around the hotel A young doctor lately graduated appeared It
was his first case but he eased Johnny Then he went over to Hopalong
who was now raving and attended to him The others were patched up
as well as possible and the struggling young physician had his pockets
crammed full of gold and silver coins

The scene of the wrecked barroom was indescribable Holes furrows
shattered glass and bottles the liquor oozing down the walls of the
shelves and running over the floor the ruined furniture a wrecked bar
seared and shattered and covered with blood bodies as they had been
piled in the corners ropes shells hats and liquor everywhere over
everything met the gaze of those who had caused the chaos

Perrys Bend had failed to wipe out the score



CHAPTER IV The Vagrant Sioux


Buckskin gradually readjusted itself to the conditions which had existed
before its sudden leap into the limelight as a town which did things
The soiree at the Houston House had drifted into the past and was
now substantially established as an epoch in the history of the
town Exuberant joy gave way to dignity and deprecation and to solid
satisfaction and the conversations across the bar brought forth
parallels of the affair to be judged impartiallyand the impartial
judgment was unanimously that while there had undoubtedly been good
fights before Perrys Bend had disturbed the local quiet they were not
quite up to the new standard of strenuous hospitality Finally the heat
blistered everything back into the old state and the shadows continued
to be in demand

One afternoon a month after the reception of the honorable delegation
from Perrys Bend the town of Buckskin seemed desolated and the earth
and the buildings thereon were as huge furnaces radiating a visible
heat but when the blazing sun had begun to settle in the west it awoke
with a clamor which might have been laid to the efforts of a zealous
Satan At this time it became the Mecca of two score or more joyous
cowboys from the neighboring ranches who livened things as those
knights of the saddle could

In the scant but heavy shadow of Cowans saloon sat a picturesque figure
from whom came guttural resonant rumblings which mingled in a spirit of
loneliness with the fretful sighs of a fleatormented dog Both dog and
master were vagrants and they were tolerated because it was a matter of
supreme indifference as to who came or how long they stayed as long as
the ethics and the unwritten law of the cow country were inviolate And
the breaking of these caused no unnecessary anxiety for justice was
both speedy and sure

When the outcast Sioux and his yellow dog had drifted into town some few
months before they had caused neither expostulation nor inquiry as the
cardinal virtue of that whole broad land was to ask a man no questions
which might prove embarrassing to all concerned judgment was of
observation not of history and a mans past would reveal itself
through actions It mattered little whether he was an embezzler or the
wild chip from some prosperous eastern block as men came to the range
to forget and to lose touch with the pampered East and the range
absorbed them as its own



A man was only a man as his skin contained the qualities necessary and
the illiterate who could ride and shoot and live to himself was far more
esteemed than the educated who could not do those things The more a man
depends upon himself and the closer is his contact to a quick judgment
the more laconic and evenpoised he becomes And the knowledge that he
is himself a judge tends to create caution and judgment He has no court
to uphold his honor and to offer him protection so he must be quick to
protect himself and to maintain his own standing His nature saved him
or it executed and the range absolved him of all unpaid penalties of a
careless past

He became a man born again and he took up his burden the exactions of
a new environment and he lived as long as those exactions gave him the
right to live He must tolerate no restrictions of his natural rights
and he must not restrict for the one would proclaim him a coward
the other a bully and both received short shrifts in that land of the
selfprotected The basic law of nature is the survival of the fittest

So when the wanderers found their level in Buckskin they were not even
asked by what name men knew them Not caring to hear a name which might
not harmonize with their idea of the fitness of things the cowboys of
the Bar20 had with a freedom born of excellent livers and fearless
temperaments bestowed names befitting their sense of humor and
adaptability The official title of the Sioux was Byandby the dog was
known as Fleas Never had names more clearly described the objects to be
represented for they were excellent examples of cowboy discernment and
aptitude

In their eyes Byandby was a man He could feel and he could resent
insults They did not class him as one of themselves because he did not
have energy enough to demand and justify such classification With them
he had a right to enjoy his life as he saw fit so long as he did not
trespass on or restrict the rights of others They were not analytic
in temperament neither were they moralists He was not a menace to
society because society had superb defenses So they vaguely recognized
his many poor qualities and clearly saw his few good ones He could
shoot when permitted with the best no horse however refractory had
ever been known to throw him he was an adept at following the trails
left by rustlers and that was an asset he became of value to the
community he was an economic factor

His ability to consume liquor with indifferent effects raised him
another notch in their estimation He was not always talking when some
one else wished toanother count There remained about him that stoical
indifference to the petty that observant nonchalance of the Indian
and there was a suggestion faint it was true of a dignity common to
chieftains He was a log of grave deference which tossed on their sea of
mischievous hilarity

He wore a pair of corduroy trousers known to the carefree as pants
which were held together by numerous patches of what had once been
brilliantly colored calico A pair of suspenders torn into two separate
straps made a belt for himself and a collar for his dog The trousers
had probably been secured during a fit of absentmindedness on his part
when their former owner had not been looking Tucked at intervals in
the top of the corduroys the exceptions making convenient shelves for
alkali dust was what at one time had been a stiffbosomed shirt This
was open down the front and back the weight of the trousers on the belt
holding it firmly on the square shoulders of the wearer thus precluding
the necessity of collar buttons A pair of moccasins beautifully worked
with wampum protected his feet from the onslaughts of cacti and the
inquisitive and pugnacious sand flies and lying across his lap was
a repeating Winchester rifle not dangerous because it was empty a
condition due to the wisdom of the citizens in forbidding any one to
sell trade or give to him those tubes of concentrated trouble because
he could get drunk

The two were contented and happy They had no cares nor duties and
their pleasures were simple and easily secured as they consisted of
sleep and a proneness to avoid moving Like the untrammeled coyote
their bed was where sleep overtook them their food what the night
wrapped in a sense of security or the generosity of the cowboys of the
Bar20 No tubridden Diogenes ever knew so little of responsibility or
as much unadulterated content There is a penalty even to civilization
and ambition

When the sun had cast its shadows beyond Byandbys feet the air became
charged with noise shouts shots and the rolling thunder of madly
pounding hoofs echoed flatly throughout the town Byandby yawned
stretched and leaned back reveling in the semiconscious ecstasy of the
knowledge that he did not have to immediately get up Fleas opened one
eye and cocked an ear in inquiry and then rolled over on his back
squirmed and sighed contentedly and long The outfit of the Bar20 had
come to town

The noise came rapidly nearer and increased in volume as the riders
turned the corner and drew rein suddenly causing their mounts to slide
on their haunches in ankledeep dust

Hullo old Buckwiththpants hows yore liver

Come up an irrigate old tank

Chase th flea ranch an trail along

These were a few of the salutations discernible among the medley of
playful yells the safety valves of supercharged goodnature

Skree yelled Hopalong Cassidy letting off a fusillade of shots in
the vicinity of Fleas who rapidly retreated around the corner where he
wagged his tail in eager expectation He was not disappointed for a cow
pony tore around in pursuit and Hopalong leaned over and scratched the
yellow back thumping it heartily and tossing a chunk of beef into the
open jaws of the delighted dog departed as he had come The advent of
the outfit meant a square meal and the dog knew it

In Cowans lined up against the bar the others were earnestly and
assiduously endeavoring with a promise of success to get Byandby
drunk which endeavors coincided perfectly with Byandbys idea of the
fitness of things The fellowship and the liquor combined to thaw
out his reserve and to loosen his tongue After gazing with an air of
injured surprise at the genial loosening of his knees he gravely handed
his rifle with an exaggerated sweep of his arm to the cowboy nearest
him and wrapped his arms around the recipient to insure his balance
The rifle was passed from hand to hand until it came to Buck Peters who
gravely presented it to its owner as a new gun

Byandby threw out his stomach in an endeavor to keep his head in line
with his heels and grasping the weapon with both hands turned to Cowan
to whom he gave it

Yu hab this un Me got two Me keep new un mebby so Then he loosened
his belt and drank long and deep

A shadow darkened the doorway and Hopalong limped in Spying Byandby
pushing the bottle into his mouth while Red Connors propped him
he grinned and took out five silver dollars which he jingled under
Byandbys eyes causing that worthy to lay aside the liquor and
erratically grab for the tantalizing fortune

Not yet sabe said Hopalong changing the position of the money If
yu wants to corral this here herd of simoleons yu has to ride a cayuse
what Red bet me yu cant ride Yu has got to grow on that there saddle
and stayed growed for five whole minutes by Bucks ticker I aint
agoin to tell yu hes any sawhorse for yud know better as yu
reckons Red wouldnt bet on no losin proposition if he knowed better
which same he dont Yu straddles that fourlaigged cloudburst an yu
gets these sabe I aint seen th cayuse yet that yu couldnt freeze
to an Im backin my opinions with my moral support an one months
pay

Byandbys eyes began to glitter as the meaning of the words
sifted through his befuddled mind Ride a horsefive dollarsride a
fivedollars horsehorses ride dollarsthen he straightened up and
began to speak in an incoherent jumble of Sioux and bad English He
the mighty rider of the Sioux he the bravest warrior and the greatest
hunter could he ride a horse for five dollars Well he rather thought
he could Grasping Red by the shoulder he tacked for the door and
narrowly missed hitting the bottom step first landing as it happened
in the soft dust with Reds leg around his neck Somewhat sobered by the
jar he stood up and apologized to the crowd for Red getting in the way
declaring that Red was a Heap good un and that he didnt mean to do
it

The outfit of the Bar20 was perhaps the most famous of all from
Canada to the Rio Grande The foreman Buck Peters controlled a crowd
of men who had all the instincts of boys that had shown no quarter
to many rustlers and who while always carefree and easygoing even
fighting with great good humor and carelessness had established the
reputation of being the most reckless gang of daredevil gunfighters
that ever pounded leather Crooked gaming houses from El Paso
to Cheyenne and from Phoenix to Leavenworth unanimously and
enthusiastically damned them from their boots to their sombreros and
the sheriffs and marshals of many localities had received from their
hands most timely assistanceand some trouble Wiry indomitable
boyish and generous they were splendid examples of virile manhood and
surrounded as they were with great dangers and a unique civilization
they should not in justice be judged by opinions born of the
commonplace

They were real cowboys which means public opinion to the contrary
notwithstanding that they were not lawless nor drunken shooting
bullies who held life cheaply as their kin has been unjustly pictured
but while these men were naturally peaceable they had to continually
rub elbows with men who were not Gamblers criminals bullies and the
riffraff that fled from the protected East had drifted among them in
great numbers and it was this class that caused the trouble

The hardworking cowpunchers lived according to the law of the land
and they obeyed that greatest of all laws that of selfpreservation
Their fun was boisterous but they paid for all the damage they
inflicted their work was one continual hardship and the reaction of
one extreme swings far toward the limit of its antithesis Go back to
the Apple if you would trace the beginning of selfpreservation and the
need

Buck Peters was a man of mild appearance somewhat slow of speech and
correspondingly quick of action who never became flurried His was the
master hand that controlled and his Colts enjoyed the reputation of
never missing when a hit could have been expected with reason Many
floods stampedes and blizzards had assailed his nerves but he yet
could pour a glass of liquor held at arms length through a knothole
in the floor without wetting the wood

Next in age came Lanky Smith a small undersized man of retiring
disposition Then came Skinny Thompson six feet four on his bared
soles and true to his name Hopalong described him as th shadow of a
chalk mark Pete Wilson the slowwitted and very taciturn and
Billy Williams the wavering pessimist were of ordinary height and
appearance Red Connors with hair that shamed the name was the
possessor of a temper which was as dry as tinder his greatest weakness
was his regard for the rifle as a means of preserving peace Johnny
Nelson was the protege and he could do no wrong

The last Hopalong Cassidy was a combination of irresponsibility
humor good nature love of fighting and nonchalance when face to face
with danger His most prominent attribute was that of always getting
into trouble without any intention of so doing in fact he was much
aggrieved and surprised when it came It seemed as though when any bad
man desired to add to his reputation he invariably selected Hopalong as
the means a fact due perhaps to the perversity of things in general
Bad men became scarce soon after Hopalong became a fixture in any
locality He had been crippled some years before in a successful
attempt to prevent the assassination of a friend Sheriff Harris of
Albuquerque and he still possessed a limp

When Red had relieved his feelings and had dug the alkali out of his
ears and eyes he led the Sioux to the rear of the saloon where a
pinto was busily engaged in endeavoring to pitch a saddle from his
back employing the intervals in trying to see how much of the picket
rope he could wrap around his legs

When Byandby saw what he was expected to ride he felt somewhat
relieved for the pony did not appear to have more than the ordinary
amount of cussedness He waved his hand and Johnny and Red bandaged the
animals eyes which quieted him at once and then they untangled
the rope from around his legs and saw that the cinches were secure
Motioning to Byandby that all was ready they jerked the bandage off
as the Indian settled himself in the saddle

Had Byandby been really sober he would have taken the conceit out of
that pony in chunks and as it was he experienced no great difficulty in
holding his seat but in his addled state of mind he grasped the end of
the cinch strap in such a way that when the pony jumped forward in
its last desperate effort the buckle slipped and the cinch became
unfastened and Byandby still seated in the saddle flew head
foremost into the horse trough where he spilled much water

As this happened Cowan turned the corner and when he saw the wasted
water which he had to carry bucketful at a time from the wells a good
quarter of a mile away his anger blazed forth and yelling he ran
for the drenched Sioux who was just crawling out of his bath When the
unfortunate saw the irate man bearing down on him he sputtered in rage
and fear and turning he ran down the street with Cowan thundering
flatfootedly behind on a fat mans gallop to the hysterical cheers of
the delighted outfit who saw in it nothing but a good joke

When Cowan returned from his hopeless task blowing and wheezing he
heard sundry remarks sotto voce which were not calculated to increase
his opinion of his physical condition

Seems to me remarked the irrepressible Hopalong that one of those
cayuses has got th heaves

It shore sounds like it acquiesced Johnny red in the face from
holding in his laughter an say somebody interferes

All knockkneed animals do yu heathen supplied Red

Hey yu let up on that and have a drink on th house invited
Cowan If I gits that durn war whoop Ill make yu think theres been
a cyclone Ill see how long that bum hangs around this here burg I
will

Reds eyes narrowed and his temper got the upper hand He aint no bum
when yu gives him rotgut at a quarter of a dollar a glass is he Any
time that bum gits razzled out for nothin moren this why I goes
too an I aint sayin nothin about goin peaceablelike neither

I knowed somethin like this ud happen dolefully sang out Billy
Williams strong on the side of his pessimism

For th Lords sake have you broke out asked Red disgustedly Im
goin to hit the trailbut just keep this afore yore mind if Byandby
gits in any accidents or aint in sight when I comes to town again this
here climatell be a heep sight hottern it is now No hard feelings
sabe Its just a casual bit of advice Come on fellows lets
ambleIm hungry

As they raced across the plain toward the ranch a pair of beady eyes
snapping with a drunken rage watched them from an arroyo and when
Cowan entered the saloon the next morning he could not find Byandbys
rifle which he had placed behind the bar He also missed a handful of
cartridges from the box near the cash drawer and had he looked closely
at his bottled whisky he would have noticed a loss there A horse was
missing from a Mexicans corral and there were rumors that several
Indians had been seen far out on the plain



CHAPTER V The Law of the Range


Phew Im shore hungry said Hopalong as he and Red dismounted at the
ranch the next morning for breakfast Wonder whats good for it

Theys three things thats good for famine said Red leading the way
to the bunk house Yu can pull in yore belt yu can drink an yu can
eat Yore getting as bad as Johnnybut hes young yet

The others met their entrance with a volley of goodhumored banter some
of which was so personal and evoked such responses that it sounded like
the preliminary skirmish to a fight But under all was that soft accent
that drawl of humorous appreciation and eyes twinkling in suppressed
merriment Here they were thoroughly at home and the spirit of
comradeship manifested itself in many subtle ways the wit became more
daring and sharp Billy lost some of his pessimism and the alertness
disappeared from their manner

Skinny left off romping with Red and yawned I wish that cookud wake
up an git breakfast Hes the cussedest hombre I ever sawhe kin go to
sleep standin up an not know it Johnnys th boy that worries himth
kid comes in an whoops things up till hes gorged himself

Johnnys got th most appallin feel for grub of anybody I knows
added Red I wonder whats keepin himhes usually hangin around here
bawlin for his grub like a spoiled calf long afore cookies got th
fire goin

Mebby he rustled some grub out with himI saw him tiptoein out of th
gallery this mornin when I come back for my cigs remarked Hopalong
glancing at Billy

Billy groaned and made for the gallery Emerging half a minute later he
blurted out his tale of woe Every time I blows myself an dont drink
it all in town some slabsided maverick freezes to it Its gone he
added dismally

Too bad Billybut what is it asked Skinny

What is it Whad yu think it was you emaciated match Jewelry
Cayuses Its whiskytwo simoleons worth Somethins allus wrong This
here whole yearths wrong just like that crosseyed sky pilot said over
to

Will yu let up Yelled Red throwing a sombrero at the grumbling
unfortunate Yu ask Buck where yore tanglefoot is

Id shore look nice askin th boss if hed rustled my whisky wouldnt
I An would yu mind throwin somebody elses hat I paid twenty wheels
for that eight years ago and I dont want it mussed none

Gee yore easy Why Ah Sing over at Albuquerque gives them away
every time yu gits yore shirt washed gravely interposed Hopalong as he
went out to cuss the cook

Well whatd yu think of that Exclaimed Billy in an injured tone

Oh yu neednt be hikin for AlbuquerqueWasheeWasheeud charge yu
double for washin yore shirt Yu ought to fall in di river some
daythen he might talk business called Hopalong over his shoulder
as he heaved an old boot into the gallery Hey yu hibernatin son of
morphine if yu dont git them flapjacks in here pretty suddenlike
Ill scatter yu all over di landscape sabe Yu just wait till Johnny
comes

Wonder where th kid is asked Lanky rolling a cigarette Off
somewhere lookin at di sun through di bottom of my bottle grumbled
Billy

Hopalong started to go out but halted on the sill and looked steadily
off toward the northwest Thats funny Hey fellows here comes Buck
an Johnny ridin doubleon a walk too he exclaimed Wonder what
ththunder Red Bucks carryun him Somethins busted he yelled as
he dashed for his pony and made for the newcomers

I told yu he was hittin my bottle pertly remarked Billy as he
followed the rest outside

Did yu ever see Johnny drunk Did yu ever see him drink moren two
glasses Shut yore wailin facetheys somethin worsen that in this
here said Red his temper rising Hopalong an me took yore cheap
liquorits under Petes bunk he added

The trio approached on a walk and Johnny delirious and covered with
blood was carried into the bunk house Buck waited until all had
assembled again and then his face dark with anger spoke sharply and
without the usual drawl Skragged from behind blast them Get some
grub an water an be quick Well see who the gent with th grudge is

At this point the expostulations of the indignant cook who not
understanding the cause regarded the invasion of china shop bulls as
sacrilegious came to his ears Striding quickly to the door he grabbed
the pan the Mexican was about to throw and turning the now frightened
man around thundered Keep quiet an get em some grub

When rifles and ammunition had been secured they mounted and followed
him at a hard gallop along the back trail No words were spoken for
none were necessary All knew that they would not return until they
had found the man for whom they were looking even if the chase led
to Canada They did not ask Buck for any of the particulars for the
foreman was not in the humor to talk and all save Hopalong whose
curiosity was always on edge recognized only two facts and cared for
nothing else Johnny had been ambushed and they were going to get the
one who was responsible

They did not even conjecture as to who it might be because the trail
would lead them to the man himself and it mattered nothing who or what
he wasthere was only one course to take with an assassin So they said
nothing but rode on with squared jaws and set lips the seven ponies
breast to breast in a close arc

Soon they came to an arroyo which they took at a leap As they
approached it they saw signs in the dust which told them that a body had
lain there huddled up and there were brown spots on the baked alkali
The trail they followed was now single Buck having ridden along the
bank of the arroyo when hunting for Johnny for whom he had orders This
trail was very irregular as if the horse had wandered at will Suddenly
they came upon five tracks all pointing one way and four of these
turned abruptly and disappeared in the northwest Half a mile beyond the
point of separation was a chaparral which was an important factor to
them

Each man knew just what had taken place as if he had been an eyewitness
for the trail was plain The assassins had waited in the chaparral for
Johnny to pass probably having seen him riding that way When he had
passed and his back had been turned to them they had fired and wounded
him severely at the first volley for Johnny was of the stuff that
fights back and his revolvers had showed full chambers and clean barrels
when Red had examined them in the bunk house Then they had given chase
for a short distance and from some inexplicable motive probably fear
they had turned and ridden off without knowing how bad he was hit It
was this trail that led to the northwest and it was this trail that
they followed without pausing

When they had covered fifty miles they sighted the Cross Bar O ranch
where they hoped to secure fresh mounts As they rode up to the ranch
house the owner Bud Wallace came around the corner and saw them

 Hullo boys What deviltry are yu up to now he asked Buck
leaped from his mount followed by the others and shoved his sombrero
back on his head as he started to remove the saddle

Were trailin a bunch of murderers They ambushed Johnny an blame
near killed him I stopped here to get fresh cayuses

Yu did right replied Wallace heartily Then raising his voice he
shouted to some of his men who were near the corral to bring up the
seven best horses they could rope Then he told the cook to bring out
plenty of food and drink

I got four punchers what aint doin nothin but eat he suggested

Much obliged Wallace but theres only four of em an wed rather
get em ourselvesJohnnyud feel better replied Buck throwing his
saddle on the horse that was led up to him

Hows yore cartridgesgot plenty Persisted Wallace

Two hundred apiece responded Buck springing into his saddle and
riding off So long he called

So long an plug blazes out of them shouted Wallace as the dust
swept over him

At five in the afternoon they forded the Black River at a point where it
crossed the state line from New Mexico and at dusk camped at the base
of the Guadalupe Mountains At daybreak they took up the chase grim and
merciless and shortly afterward they passed the smoldering remains of
a camp fire showing that the pursued had been in a great hurry for it
should have been put out and masked At noon they left the mountains to
the rear and sighted the Barred Horeshoe which they approached

The owner of the ranch saw them coming and from their appearance
surmised that something was wrong

What is it He shouted Rustlers

Nope Murderers I wants to swap cayuses quick answered Buck

There they are Th boys just brought em in Anything else I can let
yu have

Nope shouted Buck as they galloped off

Somebodys goin to get plugged full of holes murmured the ranch
owner as he watched them kicking up the dust in huge clouds

After they had forded a tributary of the Rio Penasco near the Sacramento
Mountains and had surmounted the opposite bank Hopalong spurred his
horse to the top of a hummock and swept the plain with Petes field
glasses which he had borrowed for the occasion and returned to the
rest who had kept on without slacking the pace As he took up his
former position he grunted Warwhoops and unslung his rifle an
example followed by the others

The ponies were now running at top speed and as they shot over a rise
their riders saw their quarry a mile and a half in advance One of the
Indians looked back and discharged his rifle in defiance and it now
became a race worthy of the nameDeath fled from Death The fresher
mounts of the cowboys steadily cut down the distance and as the rifles
of the pursuers began to speak the hardpressed Indians made for the
smaller of two knolls the plain leading to the larger one being too
heavily strewn with bowlders to permit speed

As the fugitives settled down behind the rocks which fringed the edge of
their elevation a shot from one of them disabled Billys arm but had no
other effect than to increase the score to be settled The pursuers
rode behind a rise and dismounted from where leaving their mounts
protected they scattered out to surround the knoll

Hopalong true to his curiosity finally turned up on the highest point
of the other knoll a spur of the range in the west for he always
wanted to see all he could Skinny due to his fighting instinct
settled one hundred yards to the north and on the same spur Buck lay
hidden behind an enormous bowlder eight hundred yards to the northeast
of Skinny and the same distance southeast of Buck was Red Connors who
was crawling up the bed of an arroyo Billy nursing his arm lay in
front of the horses and Pete from his position between Billy and
Hopalong was crawling from rock to rock in an endeavor to get near
enough to use his Colts his favorite and most effective weapons
Intermittent puffs of smoke arising from a point between Skinny and Buck
showed where Lanky Smith was improving each shining hour

There had been no directions given each man choosing his own position
yet each was of strategic worth Billy protected the horses Hopalong
and Skinny swept the knoll with a plunging fire and Lanky and Buck lay
in the course the besieged would most likely take if they tried a dash
Off to the east Red barred them from creeping down the arroyo and from
where Pete was he could creep up to within sixty yards if he chose the
right rocks The ranges varied from four hundred yards for Buck to sixty
for Pete and the others averaged close to three hundred which allowed
very good shooting on both sides

Hopalong and Skinny gradually moved nearer to each other for
companionship and as the former raised his head to see what the others
were doing he received a graze on the ear

Wow he yelled rubbing the tingling member

Two puffs of smoke floated up from the knoll and Skinny swore

Whered he get yu Fat asked Hopalong

Gwan dont get funny son replied Skinny


Jets of smoke arose from the north and east where Buck and Red were
stationed and Pete was half way to the knoll So far he hadnt been hit
as he dodged in and out and emboldened by his luck he made a run of
five yards and his sombrero was shot from his head Another dash and his
empty holster was ripped from its support As he crouched behind a rock
he heard a yell from Hopalong and saw that interested individual waving
his sombrero to cheer him on An angry pang from the knoll caused that
enthusiastic rooter to drop for safety

Locoed sonofagun complained Pete Hell shore git potted Then
he glanced at Billy who was the center of several successive spurts of
dust

Hows business Billy he called pleasantly

Oh theyll git me yet responded the pessimist Yu neednt git
anxious If that off buck wasnt so green hed a had me long ago

Yahoo Pete Oh Pete called Hopalong sticking his head out at one
side and grinning as the wondering object of his hail craned his neck to
see what the matter was

Huh grunted Pete and then remembering the distance he shouted
Whats th matter

Got any cigarettes asked Hopalong

Yu poor sheep said Pete and turning back to work he drove a 45 into
a yellow moccasin

Hopalong began to itch and he saw that he was near an ant hill Then the
cactus at his right boomed out mournfully and a hole appeared in it He
fired at the smoke and a yell informed him that he had made a hit
Go way he complained as a green fly buzzed past his nose Then he
scratched each leg with the foot of the other and squirmed incessantly
kicking out with both feet at once A warning metallic whirrr on his
left caused to yank them in again and turning his head quickly he the
pleasure of lopping off the head of a rattlesnake with his Colts

Glad yu wasnt a copperhead he exclaimed Somebody had ought a
shot that fool Noah Blast the ants He drowned with a jet of tobacco
juice a Gila monster that was staring at him and took a savage delight
in its frantic efforts to bury itself

Soon he heard Skinny swear and he sung out Whats the matter Skinny
Git plugged again

Naw bugsaint they mean Plaintively asked his friend They aint
none over here What kind of bugs

Sufferin Moses I aint no bugologist All kinds

But Hopalong got it at last He had found tobacco and rolled a
cigarette and in reaching for a match exposed his shoulder to a shot
that broke his collar bone Skinnys rifle cracked in reply and the
offending brave rolled out from behind a rock From the fuss emanating
from Hopalongs direction Skinny knew that his neighbor had been hit

Dont yu care Hoppy I got th cuss he said consolingly Whered he
git yu he asked

In di heart yu piefaced nuisance Come over here an corral this
cussed bandage an gimme some water snapped the injured man

Skinny wormed his way through the thorny chaparral and bound up the
shoulder Anything else he asked

Yes Shoot that bunch of warts an blow that tobaccoeyed Gila to
Cheyenne This heres worse than the time we cleaned out th C 80
outfit Then he kicked the dead toad and swore at the sun

Close yore yap yore worse than a kid Anybodyd think yu never got
plugged afore said Skinny indignantly

I can cuss all I wants replied Hopalong proving his assertion as he
grabbed his gun and fired at the dead Indian A bullet whined above
his head and Skinny fired at the smoke He peeped out and saw that his
friends were getting nearer to the knoll

Theys closin in now Well soon be gittin home he reported

Hopalong looked out in time to see Buck make a dash for a bowlder that
lay ten yards in front of him which he reached in safety Lanky also
ran in and Pete added five more yards to his advance Buck made
another dash but leaped into the air and coming down as if from an
intentional high jump staggered and stumbled for a few paces and then
fell flat rolling over and over toward the shelter of a split rock
where he lay quiet A leering red face peered over the rocks on the
knoll but the whoop of exultation was cut short for Reds rifle
cracked and the warrior rolled down the steep bank where another shot
from the same gun settled him beyond question

Hopalong choked and turning his face away angrily dashed his knuckles
into his eyes Blast em Blast em Theyve got Buck Theyve got
Buck blast em Theyve got Buck Skinny Good old Buck Theyve got
him Jimmys gone Johnnys plugged and now Bucks gone Come on
he sobbed in a frenzy of vengeance Come on Skinny Well tear their
cussed hides into a deeper red than they are now Oh blast it I cant
seewheres my gun He groped for the rifle and fought Skinny when the
latter redeyed but cool endeavored to restrain him Lemme go curse
yu Dont yu know they got Buck Lemme go

Down Reds got di skunk Yu cant do nothintheyd drop yu afore
yu took five steps Reds got him I tell yu Do yu want me to lick yu
Well pay em back with interest if yull keep yore head exclaimed
Skinny throwing the crazed man heavily

Musical tones rising and falling in weird octaves whining pityingly
diabolically sobbing in a fascinating monotone and slobbering in
ragged chords calling as they swept over the plain always calling and
exhorting they mingled in barbaric discord with the defiant barks of
the sixshooters and the inquiring cracks of the Winchesters High up in
the air several specks sailed and drifted more coming up rapidly from
all directions Buzzards know well where food can be found

As Hopalong leaned back against a rock he was hit in the thigh by a
ricochet that tore its way out whirling like a circular saw a span
above where it entered The wound was very nasty being ripped twice
the size made by an ordinary shot and it bled profusely Skinny crawled
over and attended to it making a tourniquet of his neckerchief and
clumsily bandaging it with a strip torn from his shirt

Yore shore lucky yu are he grumbled as he made his way back to his
post where he vented his rancor by emptying the semidepleted magazine
of his Winchester at the knoll

Hopalong began to sing and shout and he talked of Jimmy and his
childhood interspersing the broken narrative with choice selections
as sung in the music halls of Leavenworth and Abilene He wound up by
yelling and struggling and Skinny had his hands full in holding him

Hopalong Cassidy Come out of that Keep quietyull shore git plugged
if yu dont stop that plungin For gosh sake did yu hear that A
bullet viciously hissed between them and flattened out on a nearby
rock others cut their way through the chaparral to the sound of falling
twigs and Skinny threw himself on the struggling man and strapped
Hopalong with his belt to the base of a honey mesquite that grew at his
side

Hold still now and let that bandage alone Yu allus goes off di
range when yu gets plugged he complained He cut down a cactus and
poured the sap over the wounded mans face causing him to gurgle and
look around His eyes had a sane look now and Skinny slid off his chest

Git thatbelt loose I aintno cow brokenly blazed out the picketed
Hopalong Skinny did so handed the irate man his Colts and returned to
his own post from where he fired twice reporting the shots

Im tryin to get him on th glance first one went high an th other
fell flat he explained

Hopalong listened eagerly for this was shooting that he could
appreciate Lemme see he commanded Skinny dragged him over to a
crack and settled down for another try

Where is he Skinny Asked Hopalong

Behind that second big one No over on this here side See that smooth
granite If I can get her there on th right spot hell shore know it
He aimed carefully and fired

Through Petes glasses Hopalong saw a leaden splotch appear on the rock
and he notified the marksman that he was shooting high Put her on that
bump closer down he suggested Skinny did so and another yell reached
their ears

Thats a dandy Yore shore all right yu old cuss complimented
Hopalong elated at the success of the experiment

Skinny fired again and a brown arm flopped out into sight Another shot
struck it and it jerked as though it were lifeless

Hes cashed See how she jumped Like a rope remarked Skinny with a
grin The arm lay quiet

Pete had gained his last cover and was all eyes and Colts Lanky was
also very close in and was intently watching one particular rock
Several shots echoed from the far side of the knoll and they knew that
Red was all right Billy was covering a cluster of rocks that protruded
above the others and as they looked his rifle rang out and the last
defender leaped down and disappeared in the chaparral He wore yellow
trousers and an old boiled shirt

By anby by all thats bad yelled Hopalong Th measly coyote An
me afillin his ornery hide with liquor Well theyll have to find
him all over again now he complained astounded by the revelation He
fired into the chaparral to express his pugnacious disgust and scared
out a huge tarantula which alighted on Skinnys chaps crawling rapidly
toward the unconscious mans neck Hopalongs face hardened and he
slowly covered the insect and fired driving it into the sand torn
and lifeless The bullet touched the leathern garment and Skinny
remonstrated knowing that Hopalong was in no condition for fancy
shooting

Huh exclaimed Hopalong That was a tarantula what I plugged He
was headin for yore neck he explained watching the chaparral with
apprehension

Go way was it Bully for yu exclaimed Skinny tarantulas being
placed at par with rattlesnakes and he considered that he had been
saved from a horrible death Thought yu said they wasnt no bugs over
here he added in an aggrieved tone

They wasnt none Yu brought em I only had th main showGilas
rattlers an toads he replied and then added Aint it cussed hot up
here

She is Yu wont have no cinch ridin home with that leg Yu better
take my cayusehes busted moren yourn responded Skinny

Yore cayuse is at th Cross Bar O yu walleyed pirute

Shore nuff Funny how a feller forgets sometimes Lemme alone now
theys goin to git Byanby Pete an Lanky has just went in after
him

That was what had occurred The two impatient punchers had grown tired
of waiting and risked what might easily have been death in order to
hasten matters The others kept up a rapid fire directed at the far end
of the chaparral on the knoll in order to mask the movements of their
venturesome friends intending also to drive Byandby toward them so
that he would be the one to get picked off as he advanced

Several shots rang out in quick succession on the knoll and the
chaparral became agitated Several more shots sounded from the depth
of the thicket and a mounted Indian dashed out of the northern edge and
headed in Bucks direction His course would take him close to Buck
whom he had seen fall and would let him escape at a point midway
between Red and Skinny as Lanky was on the knoll and the range was very
far to allow effective shooting by these two

Red saw him leave the chaparral and in his haste to reload jammed the
cartridge and Byandby swept on toward temporary safety with Red
dancing in a paroxysm of rage swelling his vocabulary with words he had
forgotten existed

Byandby rising to his full height in the saddle turned and wiggled
his fingers at the frenzied Red and made several other signs that the
cowboy was in the humor to appreciate to the fullest extent Then he
turned and shook his rifle at the marksmen on the larger knoll whose
best shots kicked up the dust fully fifty yards too short The pony was
sweeping toward the reservation and friends only fifteen miles away
and Byandby knew that once among the mountains he would be on equal
footing at least with his enemies

As he passed the rock behind which Buck lay sprawled on his face he
uttered a piercing whoop of triumph and leaned forward on his ponys
neck Twenty leaps farther and the spiteful crack of a rifle echoed from
where the foreman was painfully supporting himself on his elbows The
pony swept on in a spurt of nerveracking speed but alone Byandby
shrieked again and crashed heavily to the ground where he rolled
inertly and then lay still Men like Buck are dangerous until their
hearts have ceased to beat



CHAPTER VI Trials of the Convalescent


The days at the ranch passed in irritating idleness for those who
had obstructed the flight of hostile lead and worse than any of the
patients was Hopalong who fretted and fumed at his helplessness which
retarded his recovery But at last the day came when he was fit for
the saddle again and he gave notice of his joy in whoops and forthwith
announced that he was entitled to a holiday and Buck had not the heart
to refuse him

So he started forth in his quest of peace and pleasure but instead had
found only trouble and had been forced to leave his card at almost every
place he had visited

There was that affair in Red Hot Gulch Colorado where under pressure
he had invested sundry pieces of lead in the persons of several
obstreperous citizens and then had paced the zealous and excitable
sheriff to the state line

He next was noticed in Cheyenne where his deformity was vividly
dwelt upon to the extent of six words by one Tarantula Charley the
aforesaid Charley not being able to proceed to greater length on account
of heart failure As Charley had been a ubiquitous nuisance those
present availed themselves of the opportunity offered by Hopalong to
indulge in a free drink

Laramie was his next stopping place and shortly after his arrival he
was requested to sing and dance by a local terror who informed all
present that he was the only seventeenbuttoned rattlesnake in the cow
country Hopalong hurt and indignant at being treated like a common
tenderfoot promptly knocked the terror down After he had irrigated
several square feet of parched throats belonging to the audience he
again took up his journey and spent a day at Denver where he managed to
avoid any further trouble

Santa Fe loomed up before him several days later and he entered it
shortly before noon At this time the old Spanish city was a bundle of
highstrung nerves and certain parts of it were calculated to furnish
any and all kinds of excitement except revival meetings and church
fairs Hopalong straddled a lively nerve before he had been in the city
an hour Two local bad men Slim Travennes and Tex Ewalt desiring to
establish the fact that they were roaring prairie fires attempted to
consume the placid and innocent stranger as he limped across the plaza
in search of a game of draw poker at the Black Hills Emporium with the
result that they needed repairs to the chagrin and disgust of their
immediate acquaintances who endeavored to drown their mortification
and sorrow in rapid but somewhat wild gun play and soon remembered that
they had pressing engagements elsewhere

Hopalong reloaded his guns and proceeded to the Emporium where he found
a game all prepared for him in every sense of the word On the third
deal he objected to the way in which the dealer manipulated the cards
and when the smoke cleared away he was the only occupant of the room
except a dog belonging to the bartender that had intercepted a stray
bullet

Hunting up the owner of the hound he apologized for being the indirect
cause of the animals death deposited a sum of Mexican dollars in
that gentlemans palm and went on his way to Alameda which he entered
shortly after dark and where an insult simmering in its uncalledfor
venom met him as he limped across the floor of the local dispensary on
his way to the bar There was no time for verbal argument and precedent
had established the manner of his reply and his repartee was as quick
as light and most effective Having resented the epithets he gave his
attention to the occupants of the room

Smoke drifted over the table in an agitated cloud and dribbled lazily
upward from the muzzle of his sixshooter while he looked searchingly
at those around him Strained and eager faces peered at his opponent
who was sliding slowly forward in his chair and for the length of a
minute no sound but the guarded breathing of the onlookers could be
heard This was broken by a nervous cough from the rear of the room and
the faces assumed their ordinary nonchalant expressions their rugged
lines heavily shadowed in the light of the flickering oil lamps while
the shuffling of cards and the clink of silver became audible Hopalong
Cassidy had objected to insulting remarks about his affliction

Hopalong was very sensitive about his crippled leg and was always
prompt to resent any scorn or curiosity directed at it especially
when emanating from strangers A young man of twentythree years when
surrounded by nearly perfect specimens of physical manhood is apt to
be painfully selfconscious of any such defect and it reacted on his
nature at times even though he was wellknown for his happygolucky
disposition and playfulness He consoled himself with the knowledge
that what he lost in symmetry was more than balanced by the celerity
and certainty of his gun hand which was right or left or both as the
occasion demanded

Several hours later as his luck was vacillating he felt a heavy hand
on his shoulder and was overjoyed at seeing Buck and Red the latter
grinning as only Red could grin and he withdrew from the game to enjoy
his good fortune

While Hopalong had been wandering over the country the two friends had
been hunting for him and had traced him successfully that being due
to the trail he had blazed with his sixshooters This they had
accomplished without harm to themselves as those of whom they inquired
thought that they must want Hopalong bad and cheerfully gave the
information required

They had started out more for the purpose of accompanying him for
pleasure but that had changed to an urgent necessity in the following
manner

While on the way from Denver to Santa Fe they had met Pete Willis of the
Three Triangle a ranch that adjoined their own and they paused to pass
the compliments of the season

Purty far from th grub wagon Pie remarked Buck

Oh Im only goin to Denver responded Pie

Purty hot suggested Red

She shore is Seen anybody yu knows Pie asked

One or twoBilly of th Star Crescent an Panhandle Lukins answered
Buck

That so Panhandles goin to punch for us next year Ill hunt him up
I heard down south of Albuquerque that Thirsty Jones an his brothers
are lookin for trouble offered Pie

Yah They aint lookin for no troublethey just goes around
blowin off Trouble Why they dont know what she is remarked Red
contemptuously

Well theys been dodgin th sheriff purty lively lately an if that
aint trouble I dont know what is said Pie

It shore is an hard to dodge acquiesced Buck

Well I has to amble Is Panhandle in Denver Yes I calculates as
how me an himll buck th tiger for a whirlhes shore lucky Well so
long said Pie as he moved on

So long responded the two

Hey wait a minute yelled Pie after he had ridden a hundred yards
If yu sees Hopalong yu might tell him that th Joneses are goin to
hunt him up when they gits to Albuquerque Theys shore sore on him
Taint none of my funeral only they aint always acarin how they
goes after a feller So long and soon he was a cloud of dust on the
horizon

Trouble snorted Red well between dodgin Harris an huntin
Hopalong I reckons theyll shore find her Then to himself he murmured
Funny how everythin comes his way

Thats gospel shore enough but as Pie said they aint a whole lot
particular as how they deal th cards We better get a move on an find
that ornery little cuss replied Buck

O K only I aint losin no sleep about Hoppy His guns too lively
for me to do any worryin asserted Red

Theyll get lynched some time shore declared Buck

Not if they find Hoppy grimly replied Red

They tore through Santa Fe only stopping long enough to wet their
throats and after several hours of hard riding entered Alameda where
they found Hopalong in the manner narrated

After some time the three left the room and headed for Albuquerque
twelve miles to the south At ten oclock they dismounted before the
Nugget and Rope an unpainted wooden building supposed to be a
clever combination of barroom dance and gambling hall and hotel The
cleverness lay in the man who could find the hotel part



CHAPTER VII The Open Door


The proprietor of the Nugget and Rope a German named Baum not being
troubled with police rules kept the door wide open for the purpose
of inviting trade a proceeding not to the liking of his patrons for
obvious reasons Probably not one man in ten was fortunate enough to
have no one looking for him and the lighted interior assured good
hunting to any one in the dark street He was continually opening the
door which every newcomer promptly and forcibly slammed shut When he
saw men walk across the room for the express purpose of slamming it he
began to cherish the idea that there was a conspiracy on foot to anger
him and thus force him to bring about his own death

After the door had been slammed three times in one evening by one man
the last slam being so forcible as to shake two bottles from the shelf
and to crack the door itself he became positive that his suspicions
were correct and so was very careful to smile and take it as a joke
Finally wearied by his vain efforts to keep it open and fearing for the
door he hit upon a scheme the brilliancy of which inflated his chest
and gave him the appearance of a prizewinning bantam When his patrons
strolled in that night there was no door to slam as it lay behind the
bar

When Buck and Red entered closely followed by Hopalong they elbowed
their way to the rear of the room where they could see before being
seen As yet they had said nothing to Hopalong about Pies warning and
were debating in their minds whether they should do so or not when
Hopalong interrupted their thoughts by laughing They looked up and he
nodded toward the front where they saw that anxious eyes from all parts
of the room were focused on the open door Then they noticed that it had
been removed

The air of semihostile semianxious inquiry of the patrons and the
smile of satisfaction covering the face of Baum appealed to them as the
most ludicrous sight their eyes had seen for months and they leaned
back and roared with laughter thus calling forth sundry looks of
disapproval from the innocent causes of their merriment But they were
too well known in Albuquerque to allow the disapproval to approach a
serious end and finally as the humorous side of the situation dawned
on the crowd they joined in the laugh and all went merrily


At the psychologic moment some one shouted for a dance and the
suggestion met with uproarious approval At that moment Harris the
sheriff came in and volunteered to supply the necessary music if the
crowd would pay the fine against a straying fiddler he had corraled the
day before A hat was quickly passed and a sum was realized which would
pay several fines to come and Harris departed for the music

A chair was placed on the bar for the musician and to the tune of Old
Dan Tucker and an assortment of similar airs the board floor shook
and trembled It was a comical sight and Hopalong the only wallflower
besides Baum and the sheriff laughed until he became weak Cow punchers
play as they work hard and earnestly and there was plenty of action
Sombreros flapped like huge wings and the baggy chaps looked like small
distorted balloons

The Virginia reel was a marvel of supple exaggerated grace and the
quadrille looked like a freeforall for unbroken colts The honor
of prompter was conferred upon the sheriff and he gravely called the
changes as they were usually called in that section of the country

 Oh th ladies trail in
 An th gents trail out
 An all stampede down th middle
 If yu aint got th tin
 Yu can dance an shout
 But yu must keep up with th fiddle


As the dance waxed faster and the dancers grew hotter Hopalong
feeling lonesome because he wouldnt face ridicule even if it was not
expressed went over and stood by the sheriff He and Harris were good
friends for he had received the wound that crippled him in saving the
sheriff from assassination Harris killed the man who had fired that
shot and from this episode on the burning desert grew a friendship that
was as strong as their own natures

Harris was very well liked by the majority and feared by the rest for
he was a square man and the best sheriff the county had ever known
Quiet and unassuming small of stature and with a kind word for every
one he was a universal favorite among the better class of citizens
Quick as a flash and unerring in his shooting he was a nightmare to the
bad men No profane word had ever been known to leave his lips and
he was the possessor of a widespread reputation for generosity His
face was naturally frank and open but when his eyes narrowed with
determination it became blank and cold When he saw his young friend
sidle over to him he smiled and nodded a hearty welcome



Theys shore cuttin her loose remarked Hopalong

First two pairs forward an backthey shore is responded the
prompter

Whos th gent playin lady to Buck Queried Hopalong

Forward again an ladies changeBilly Jordan

Hopalong watched the couple until they swung around and then he laughed
silently Bucks got too many feet he seriously remarked to his
friend

Swing th girl yu loves th besthe aint lonesome look at that

Two shots rang out in quick succession and Harris stumbled wheeled and
pitched forward on his face as Hopalongs sombrero spun across his
body For a second there was an intense silence heavy strained
and sickening Then a roar broke forth and the crowd of frenzied
merrymakers headed by Hopalong poured out into the street and spread
out to search the town As daylight dawned the searchers began to
straggle back with the same report of failure Buck and Red met on the
street near the door and each looked questioningly at the other Each
shook his head and looked around their fingers toying absentmindedly at
their belts Finally Buck cleared his throat and remarked casually

Mebby hes following em

Red nodded and they went over toward their horses As they were
hesitating which route to take Billy Jordan came up

Mebby yud like to see yore pardnerhes out by Buzzards Spring Well
take care of him jerking his thumb over his shoulder toward the saloon
where Harriss body lay And well all git th others later They
caint git away for long

Buck and Red nodded and headed for Buzzards Spring As they neared the
water hole they saw Hopalong sitting on a rock his head resting in one
hand while the other hung loosely from his knee He did not notice
them when they arrived and with a ready tact they sat quietly on their
horses and looked in every direction except toward him The sun became
a ball of molten fire and the sand flies annoyed them incessantly but
still they sat and waited silent and apologetic

Hopalong finally arose reached for his sombrero and finding it gone
swore long and earnestly at the scene its loss brought before him He
walked over to his horse and leaping into the saddle turned and faced
his friends Yu old sonsofguns he said They looked sheepish and
nodded negatively in answer to the look of inquiry in his eyes They
aint got em yet remarked Red slowly Hopalong straightened up his
eyes narrowed and his face became hard and resolute as he led the way
back toward the town

Buck rode up beside him and wiping his face with his shirt sleeve
began to speak to Red We might look up th Joneses Red They had been
dodgin th sheriff purty lively lately an they was huntin Hopalong
Ever since we had to kill their brother in Buckskin they has been
yappin as how they was goin to wipe us out Hopalong an Harris was
standin clost together an they tried for both They shot twice one
for Harris an one for Hopalong an what more do yu want

It shore looks thataway Buck replied Red biting into a huge plug of
tobacco which he produced from his chaps Anyhow they wouldnt be no
loss if they didnt Member what Pie said

Hopalong looked straight ahead and when he spoke the words sounded as
though he had bitten them off Yore right Buck but I gits first try
at Thirsty Hes my meat an Ill plug th fellow what says he aint
Damn him

The others replied by applying their spurs and in a short time they
dismounted before the Nugget and Rope Thirsty wouldnt have a chance to
not care how he dealt the cards

Buck and Red moved quickly through the crowd speaking fast and
earnestly When they returned to where they had left their friend they
saw him half a block away and they followed slowly one on either side
of the street There would be no bullets in his back if they knew what
they were about and they usually did

As Hopalong neared the corner Thirsty and his two brothers turned it
and saw him Thirsty said something in a low voice and the other two
walked across the street and disappeared behind the store When assured
that they were secure Thirsty walked up to a huge boulder on the side
of the street farthest from the store and turned and faced his enemy
who approached rapidly until about five paces away when he slowed up
and finally stopped

For a number of seconds they sized each other up Hopalong quiet
and deliberate with a deadly hatred Thirsty pale and furtive with a
sensation hitherto unknown to him It was Right meeting Wrong and Wrong
lost confidence Often had Thirsty Jones looked death in the face and
laughed but there was something in Hopalongs eyes that made his flesh
creep

He glanced quickly past his foe and took in the scene with one flash of
his eyes There was the crowd eager expectant scowling There were
Buck and Red each lounging against a boulder Buck on his right Red
on his left Before him stood the only man he had ever feared Hopalong
shifted his feet and Thirsty coming to himself with a start smiled
His nerve had been shaken but he was master of himself once more

Well he snarled scowling

Hopalong made no response but stared him in the eyes

Thirsty expected action and the deadly quiet of his enemy oppressed
him He stared in turn but the insistent searching of his opponents
eyes scorched him and he shifted his gaze to Hopalongs neck

Well he repeated uneasily

Did yu have a nice time at th dance last night Asked Hopalong still
searching the face before him

Was there a dance I was over in Alameda replied Thirsty shortly

Yaas there was a dance an yu can shoot purty durn far if yu was in
Alameda responded Hopalong his voice low and monotonous

Thirsty shifted his feet and glanced around Buck and Red were still
lounging against their bowlders and apparently were not paying any
attention to the proceedings His fickle nerve came back again for
he knew he would receive fair play So he faced Hopalong once more and
regarded him with a cynical smile

Yu seems to worry a whole lot about me Is it because yu has a
tender feelin or because its none of yore blame business He asked
aggressively

Hopalong paled with sudden anger but controlled himself

Its because yu murdered Harris he replied

Shoo An how does yu figger it out Asked Thirsty jauntily

He was huntin yu hard an yu thought yud stop it so yu came in to
lay for him When yu saw me an him together yu saw di chance to
wipe out another score Thats how I figger it out replied Hopalong
quietly

Yore a reglar tective aint yu Thirsty asked ironically

Ive got common sense responded Hopalong

Yu has Yu better tell th rest that too replied Thirsty

I know yu shot Harris an yu cant get out of it by makin funny
remarks Anyhow yu wont be much loss an th stage companyll feel
better too

Shoo An suppose I did shoot him I done a good job didnt I

Yu did the worst job yu could do yu highway robber softly said
Hopalong at the same time moving nearer Harris knew yu stopped th
stage last month an thats why yuve been dodgin him

Yore a liar shouted Thirsty reaching for his gun

The movement was fatal for before he could draw the Colt in Hopalongs
holster leaped out and flashed from its owners hip and Thirsty fell
sideways face down in the dust of the street

Hopalong started toward the fallen man but as he did so a shot rang out
from behind the store and he pitched forward stumbled and rolled behind
the bowlder As he stumbled his left hand streaked to his hip and when
he fell he had a gun in each hand

As he disappeared from sight Goodeye and Bill Jones stepped from behind
the store and started to run away Not able to resist the temptation to
look again they stopped and turned and Bill laughed

Easy as sin he said

Run yu foolRed an Buckll be here Want to git plugged shouted
Goodeye angrily

They turned and started for a group of ponies twenty yards away and as
they leaped into the saddles two shots were fired from the street As
the reports died away Buck and Red turned the corner of the store Colts
in hand and checking their rush as they saw the saddles emptied they
turned toward the street and saw Hopalong with blood oozing from an
abrasion on his cheek sitting up crosslegged with each hand holding a
gun from which came thin wisps of smoke

Th sonofagun cried Buck proud and delighted

Th sonofagun echoed Red grinning



CHAPTER VIII Hopalong Keeps His Word

The waters of the Rio Grande slid placidly toward the Gulf the hot sun
branding the sleepy waters with streaks of molten fire To the north
arose from the gray sandy plain the Quitman Mountains and beyond them
lay Bass Ca on From the latter emerged a solitary figure astride a
broncho and as he ascended the topmost rise he glanced below him at the
placid stream and beyond it into Mexico As he sat quietly in his saddle
he smiled and laughed gently to himself The trail he had just followed
had been replete with trouble which had suited the state of his mind
and he now felt humorous having cleaned up a pressing debt with his
sixshooter Surely there ought to be a mild sort of excitement in the
land he faced something picturesque and out of the ordinary This
was to be the finishing touch to his trip and he had left his two
companions at Albuquerque in order that he might have to himself all
that he could find

Not many miles to the south of him lay the town which had been the
rendezvous of Tamale Jose whose weakness had been a liking for other
peoples cattle Well he remembered his first man hunt the discovery
of the theft the trail and pursuit andthe ending He was scarcely
eighteen years of age when that event took place and the wisdom he had
absorbed then had stood him in good stead many times since He had even
now a touch of pride at the recollection how when his older companions
had failed to get Tamale Jose he with his undeveloped strategy had
gained that end The fight would never be forgotten as it was his
first and no sight of wounds would ever affect him as did those of Red
Connors as he lay huddled up in the dark corner of that old adobe hut

He came to himself and laughed again as he thought of Carmencita the
first girl he had ever knownand the last With a boys impetuosity he
had wooed her in a manner far different from that of the peons who sang
beneath her window and talked to her mother He had boldly scaled the
wall and did his courting in her house trusting to luck and to his
own ability to avoid being seen No hidden meaning lay in his words
he spoke from his heart and with no concealment And he remembered the
treachery that had forced him fighting to the camp of his outfit and
when he had returned with his friends she had disappeared

To this day he hated that mudwalled convent and those sisters who
so easily forgot how to talk The fragrance of the old days wrapped
themselves around him and although he had ceased to pine for his
blackeyed Carmencitawell it would be nice if he chanced to see her
again Spurring his mount into an easy canter he swept down to and
across the river fording it where he had crossed it when pursuing
Tamale Jose

The town lay indolent under the Mexican night and the strumming of
guitars and the tinkle of spurs and tiny bells softly echoed from
several houses The convent of St Maria lay indistinct in its heavy
shadows and the little church farther up the dusty street showed dim
lights in its stained windows Off to the north became audible the
rhythmic beat of a horse and soon a cowboy swept past the convent with a
mocking bow

He clattered across the stonepaved plaza and threw his mount back
on its haunches as he stopped before a house Glancing around and
determining to find out a few facts as soon as possible he rode up
to the low door and pounded upon it with the butt of his Colt After
waiting for possibly half a minute and receiving no response he hammered
a tune upon it with two Colts and had the satisfaction of seeing half a
score of heads protrude from the windows in the nearby houses

If I could scare up another gun I might get th whole blamed town up
he grumbled whimsically and fell on the door with another tune

Who is it came from within The voice was distinctly feminine and
Hopalong winked to himself in congratulation

Me he replied twirling his fingers from his nose at the curious
forgetting that the darkness hid his actions from sight

Yes I know but who is me Came from the house

Aint I a fool he complained to himself and raising his voice he
replied coaxingly Open th door a bit an see Are yu Carmencita

Ooo but you must tell me who it is first

Mr Cassidy he replied flushing at the mister an I wants to see
Carmencita

Carmencita who teasingly came from behind the door Hopalong
scratched his head Gee yuve roped meI suppose she has got another
handle Oh yu knowshe used to live here about seven years back She
had great big black eyes pretty cheeks an a mouth that ud stampede
anybody Dont yu know now She was about so high holding out his
hands in the darkness

The door opened a trifle on a chain and Hopalong peered eagerly forward

Ah it is you the brave Americano You must go away quick or you will
meet with harm Manuel is awfully jealous and he will kill you Go at
once please

Hopalong pulled at the halfhearted down upon his lip and laughed
softly Then he slid the guns back in their holsters and felt for his
sombrero

Manuel wants to see me first Star Eyes

No no she replied stamping upon the floor vehemently You must go
nowat once

Id shore look nice hittin th trail because Manuel Somebody wants
to get hurt wouldnt I Dont yu remember how I used to shinny up this
here wall an skin th cat gettin through that hole up there what yu
said was a window Ah come on an open th doorId shore like to see
yu again pleaded the irrepressible

No no Go away Oh wont you please go away

Hopalong sighed audibly and turned his horse As he did so he heard the
door open and a sigh reached his ears He wheeled like a flash and found
the door closed again on its chain A laugh of delight came from behind
it

Come out pleasejust for a minute he begged wishing that he was
brave enough to smash the door to splinters and grab her

If I do will you go away Asked the girl Oh what will Manuel say
if he comes And all those people theyll tell him

Hey yu shouted Hopalong brandishing his Colts at the protruding
heads Git scarce Ill shore plug th last one in Then he laughed at
the sudden vanishing

The door slowly opened and Carmencita fat and drowsy wobbled out
to him Hopalongs feelings were interfering with his breathing as he
surveyed her Oh yu shore are mistaken Mrs Carmencita I wants to
see yore daughter

Ah you have forgotten the little Carmencita who used to look for you
Like all the men you have forgotten she cooed reproachfully Then her
fear predominated again and she cried Oh if my husband should see me
now

Hopalong mastered his astonishment and bowed He had a desire to ride
madly into the Rio Grande and collect his senses

Yu are rightthis is too dangerousIll amble on some he replied
hastily Under his breath he prayed that the outfit would never learn
of this He turned his horse and rode slowly up the street as the door
closed

Rounding the corner he heard a soft footfall and swerving in his saddle
he turned and struck with all his might in the face of a man who leaped
at him at the same time grasping the uplifted wrist with his other
hand A curse and the tinkle of thin steel on the pavement accompanied
the fall of his opponent Bending down from his saddle he picked up the
weapon and the next minute the enraged assassin was staring into the
unwavering and to him growing muzzle of a Colts 45

Yu shore had a bum teacher Dont yu know bettern to push it in An
me a cowpuncher too Im most grieved at yore conductit shows you
dont appreciate cowwrastlers This is safer he remarked throwing
the stiletto through the air and into a door where it rang out angrily
and quivered I dont know as I wants to ventilate yu we mostly
poisons coyotes up my way he added Then a thought struck him Yu
must be that dear Manuel Ive been hearin so much about

A snarl was the only reply and Hopalong grinned

Yu shore aint got no call to go loco that way none whatever I dont
want yore Carmencita I only called to say hulloo responded Hopalong
his sympathies being aroused for the wounded man before him from his
vivid recollection of the woman who had opened the door

Yah snarled Manuel You wants to poison my little bird You with
your fair hair and your cursed swagger

The sixshooter tentatively expanded and stopped six inches from the
Mexicans nose Yu wants to ride easy hombre I aint no angel but I
dont poison no woman an dont yu amble off with th idea in yore head
that she wants to be poisoned Why she near stuck a knife in me he
lied

The Mexicans face brightened somewhat but it would take more than that
to wipe out the insult of the blow The horse became restless and when
Hopalong had effectively quieted it he spoke again

Did yu ever hear of Tamale Jose

Yes

Well Im th fellow that stopped him in th dobe hut by th arroyo
Im tellin yu this so yu wont do nothin rash an leave Carmencita a
widow Sabe

The hate on the Mexicans face redoubled and he took a short step
forward but stopped when the muzzle of the Colt kissed his nose He was
the brother of Tamale Jose As he backed away from the cool touch of
the weapon he thought out swiftly his revenge Some of his brothers
old companions were at that moment drinking mescal in a saloon down the
street and they would be glad to see this Americano die He glanced
past his house at the saloon and Hopalong misconstrued his thoughts

Shore go home Ill just circulate around some for exercise No hard
feelings only yu better throw it next time he said as he backed away
and rode off Manuel went down the street and then ran into the saloon
where he caused an uproar

Hopalong rode to the end of the plaza and tried to sing but it was a
dismal failure Then he felt thirsty and wondered why he hadnt thought
of it before Turning his horse and seeing the saloon he rode up to it
and in lying flat on the animals neck to avoid being swept off by the
door frame His entrance scared white some half a dozen loungers who
immediately sprang up in a decidedly hostile manner Hopalongs Colts
peeped over the ears of his horse and he backed into a corner near the
bar

One two threenow altogether breathe Yu acts like yu never saw a
real puncher afore All th same he remarked nodding at several
of the crowd Ive seen yu afore Yu are th gents with th hotfoot
getaway that vamoosed when we got Tamale

Curses were flung at him and only the humorous mood he was in saved
trouble One bolder than the rest spoke up The senor will not see
any hotfoot getaway as he calls it now The senor was not wise to
go so far away from his friends

Hopalong looked at the speaker and a quizzical grin slowly spread over
his face Theyll shore feel glad when I tells them yu was askin for
em But didnt yu see too much of em once or was yu poundin leather
in the other direction Yu dont want to worry none about mean if yu
dont get yore hands closter to yore neck theyll be heck to pay There
thats more like home he remarked nodding assurance

Reaching over he grasped a bottle and poured out a drink his Colt
slipping from his hand and dangling from his wrist by a thong As the
weapon started to fall several of the audience involuntarily moved as if
to pick it up Hopalong noticed this and paused with the glass half
way to his lips Dont bother yoreselves none I can git it again he
said tossing off the liquor

Wow Holy smoke he yelled This aint drink Sufferin coyotes
nobody can accuse yu of sellin liquor Did yu make this all by
yoreself He asked incredulously of the proprietor who didnt know
whether to run or to pray Then he noticed that the crowd was spreading
out and his Colts again became the center of interest

Yu with th lovely face sit down he ordered as the person addressed
was gliding toward the door I aint agoin to let yu pot me from th
street Th first man who tries to get scarce will stop somethin hot
An yu all better sit down he suggested sweeping them with his guns
One man more obdurate than the rest was slow in complying and Hopalong
sent a bullet through the top of his high sombrero which had a most
gratifying effect

Youll regret this hissed a man in the rear and a murmur of
assent arose Some one stirred slightly in searching for a weapon and
immediately a blazing Colt froze him into a statue

Yu shore looks funny eeny meeny miny mo counted off the daring
horseman move a bit an off yu go he finished Then his face broke
out in another grin as he thought of more enjoyment

That there gent on th left he said pointing out with a gun the man
he meant Yu sing us a song Sing a nice little song

As the object of his remarks remained mute he let his thumb
ostentatiously slide back with the hammer of the gun under it Sing
Quick The man sang

As Hopalong leaned forward to say something a stiletto flashed past his
neck and crashed into the bottle beside him The echo of the crash was
merged into a report as Hopalong fired from his waist Then he backed
out into the Street and wheeling galloped across the plaza and again
faced the saloon A flash split the darkness and a bullet hummed over
his head and thudded into an adobe wall at his back Another shot and he
replied aiming at the flash

From down the Street came the sound of a window opening and he promptly
caused it to close again Several more windows opened and hastily
closed and he rode slowly toward the far end of the plaza As he faced
the saloon once more he heard a command to throw up his hands and saw
the glint of a gun held by a man who wore the insignia of sheriff
Hopalong complied but as his hands went up two spurts of fire shot
forth and the sheriff dropped his weapon reeled and sat down Hopalong
rode over to him and swinging down picked up the gun and looked the
officer over



Shoo yull be all right soonyore only plugged in th arms he
remarked as he glanced up the street Shadowy forms were gliding from
cover to cover and he immediately caused consternation among them by
his accuracy Aint it sad He complained to the wounded man I never
starts out but what somebody makes me shoot em Came down here to see
a girl an find shes married Then when I moves on peaceablelike her
husband makes me hit him Then I wants a drink an he goes an fans a
knife at me an me just teachin him how Then yu has to come along an
make more trouble

Now look at them fools over there he said pointing at a dark shadow
some fifty paces off Theyre pattin their backs because I dont
see em an if I hurts them theyll git mad Guess Ill make em dust
along he added shooting into the spot A howl went up and two men ran
away at top speed

The sheriff nodded his sympathy and spoke I reckons you had better
give up You cant get away Every house every corner and shadow holds
a man You are a brave man but as you say unfortunate Better help me
up and come with metheyll tear you to pieces

Shore Ill help yu upI aint got no grudge against nobody But my
friends know where I am an theyll come down here an raise a ruction
if I dont show up So if its all th same to you Ill be ambling
right along he said as he helped the sheriff to his feet

Have you any objections to telling me your name Asked the sheriff as
he looked himself over

None whatever answered Hopalong heartily Im Hopalong Cassidy of
th Bar 20 Texas

You dont surprise meIve heard of you replied the sheriff wearily
You are the man who killed Tamale Jose whom I hunted for unceasingly
I found him when you had left and I got the reward Come again some
time and Ill divide with you two hundred and fifty dollars he added
craftily

I shore will but I dont want no money replied Hopalong as he turned
away Adios senor he called back

Adios replied the sheriff as he kicked a nearby door for assistance

The cowpony tied itself up in knots as it pounded down the street
toward the trail and although he was fired on he swung into the dusty
trail with a song on his lips Several hours later he stood dripping wet
on the American side of the Rio Grande and shouted advice to a score of
Mexican cavalrymen on the opposite bank Then he slowly picked his way
toward El Paso for a game at Faro Dans

The sheriff sat in his easy chair one night some three weeks later
gravely engaged in rolling a cigarette His arms were practically well
the wounds being in the fleshy parts He was a philosopher and was
disposed to take things easy which accounted for his being in his
official position for fifteen years A gentleman at the core he was
well educated and had visited a goodly portion of the world A book of
Horace lay open on his knees and on the table at his side lay a shining
new revolver Hopalong having carried off his former weapon He read
aloud several lines and in reaching for a light for his cigarette
noticed the new sixshooter His mind leaped from Horace to Hopalong
and he smiled grimly at the latters promise to call

Glancing up his eyes fell on a poster which conveyed the information in
Spanish and in English that there was offered

 
   FIVE HUNDRED PESOS  

 REWARD

 For Hopalong Cassidy of the Ranch

   Known as the Bar20 Texas U S A  

 

and which gave a good description of that gentleman

Sighing for the five hundred he again took up his book and was lost in
its pages when he heard a knock rather low and timid Wearily laying
aside his reading he strode to the door expecting to hear a lengthy
complaint from one of his townsmen As he threw the door wide open the
light streamed out and lighted up a revolver and behind it the beaming
face of a cowboy who grinned

Well Ill be damned ejaculated the sheriff starting back in
amazement

Dont say that sheriff youve got lots of time to reform replied a
humorous voice Hows th wings

Almost well you were considerate responded the sheriff Lets go
insomebody might see me out here an get into trouble suggested the
visitor placing his foot on the sill

Certainlypardon my discourtesy said the sheriff You see I
wasnt expecting you tonight he explained thinking of the
elaborate preparations that he would have gone to if he had thought the
irrepressible would call

Well I was down this way an seeing as how I had promised to drop
in I just natchurally dropped replied Hopalong as he took the chair
proffered by his host

After talking awhile on everything and nothing the sheriff coughed and
looked uneasily at his guest

Mr Cassidy I am sorry you called for I like men of your energy and
courage and I very much dislike to arrest you remarked the sheriff
Of course you understand that you are under arrest he added with
anxiety

Who me Asked Hopalong with a rising inflection

Most assuredly breathed the sheriff

Why this is the first time I ever heard anything about it replied
the astonished cowpuncher Im an Americandont that make any
difference

Not in this case Im afraid You see its for manslaughter

Well dont that beat th devil now Said Hopalong He felt sorry
that a citizen of the glorious United States should be prey for
troublesome sheriffs but he was sure that his duty to Texas called upon
him never to submit to arrest at the hands of a Mexican Remembering
the Alamo and still behind his Colt he reached over and took up the
shining weapon from the table and snapped it open on his knee After
placing the cartridges in his pocket he tossed the gun over on the bed
and reaching inside his shirt drew out another and threw it after the
first

Thats yore gun I forgot to leave it he said apologetically
Anyhow yu needs two he added

Then he glanced around the room noticed the poster and walked over
and read it A full swift sweep of his gloved hand tore it from its
fastenings and crammed it under his belt The glimmer of anger in his
eyes gave way as he realized that his head was worth a definite price
and he smiled at what the boys would say when he showed it to them
Planting his feet far apart and placing his arms akimbo he faced his
host in grim defiance

Got any more of these He inquired placing his hand on the poster
under his belt

Several replied the sheriff

Trot em out ordered Hopalong shortly

The sheriff sighed stretched and went over to a shelf from which he
took a bundle of the articles in question Turning slowly he looked at
the puncher and handed them to him

I reckons theys all over this here town remarked Hopalong

They are and you may never see Texas again

So Well yu tell yore most particular friends that the job is worth
five thousand and that it will take so many to do it that when th
mazuma is divided up it wont buy a meal Theres only one man in this
country tonight that can earn that money an thats me said the
puncher An I dont need it he added smiling

But you are my prisoneryou are under arrest enlightened the sheriff
rolling another cigarette The sheriff spoke as if asking a question
Never before had five hundred dollars been so close at hand and yet so
unobtainable It was like having a checkbook but no bank account

Im shore sorry to treat yu mean remarked Hopalong but I was paid a
month in advance an Ill have to go back an earn it

You canif you say that you will return replied the sheriff
tentatively The sheriff meant what he said and for the moment had
forgotten that he was powerless and was not the one to make terms

Hopalong was amazed and for a time his ideas of Mexicans staggered under
the blow Then he smiled sympathetically as he realized that he faced a
white man

Never like to promise nothin he replied I might get plugged or
something might happen that wouldnt let me Then his face lighted up
as a thought came to him Say Ill cut di cards with yu to see if I
comes back or not

The sheriff leaned back and gazed at the cool youngster before him
A smile of satisfaction partly at the selfreliance of his guest and
partly at the novelty of his situation spread over his face He reached
for a pack of Mexican cards and laughed Man Youre a cool oneIll do
it What do you call

Red answered Hopalong

The sheriff slowly raised his hand and revealed the ace of hearts
Hopalong leaned back and laughed at the same time taking from his
pocket the six extracted cartridges Arising and going over to the
bed he slipped them in the chambers of the new gun and then placed the
loaded weapon at the sheriffs elbow

Well I reckon Ill amble sheriff he said as he opened the door If
yu ever sifts up my way drop in an see meth boysll give yu a good
time

Thanks I will be glad to replied the sheriff Youll take your
pitcher to the well once too often some day my friend This courtesy
glancing at the restored revolver might have cost you dearly

Shoo I did that once an th feller tried to use it replied
the cowboy as he backed through the door Some people are awfully
careless he added So long

So long replied the sheriff wondering what sort of a man he had been
entertaining

The door closed softly and soon after a joyous whoop floated in from
the Street The sheriff toyed with the new gun and listened to the low
caress of a distant guitar

Well dont that beat all He ejaculated



CHAPTER IX The Advent of McAllister


The blazing sun shone pitilessly on an arid plain which was spotted
with dustgray clumps of mesquite and thorny chaparral Basking in the
burning sand and alkali lay several Gila monsters which raised their
heads and hissed with wideopen jaws as several faint whiplike reports
echoed flatly over the desolate plain showing that even they had
learned that danger was associated with such sounds

Off to the north there became visible a cloud of dust and at intervals
something swayed in it something that rose and fell and then became
hidden again Out of that cloud came sharp splitting sounds which were
faintly responded to by another and larger cloud in its rear As it came
nearer and finally swept past the Gilas to their terror saw a madly
pounding horse and it carried a man The latter turned in his saddle
and raised a gun to his shoulder and the thunder that issued from it
caused the creeping audience to throw up their tails in sudden panic and
bury themselves out of sight in the sand

The horse was only a broncho its sides covered with hideous yellow
spots and on its near flank was a peculiar scar the brand Foam
flecked from its crimsoned jaws and found a resting place on its sides
and on the hairy chaps of its rider Sweat rolled and streamed from its
heaving flanks and was greedily sucked up by the droughtcursed alkali
Close to the riders knee a bloody furrow ran forward and one of the
bronchos ears was torn and limp The broncho was doing its bestit
could run at that pace until it dropped dead Every ounce of strength it
possessed was put forth to bring those hind hoofs well in front of
the forward ones and to send them pushing the sand behind in streaming
clouds The horse had done this same thing many timeswhen would its
master learn sense

The man was typical in appearance with many of that broad land Lithe
sinewy and bronzed by hard riding and hot suns he sat in his Cheyenne
saddle like a centaur all his weight on the heavy leatherguarded
stirrups his body rising in one magnificent straight line A bleached
moustache hid the thin lips and a gray sombrero threw a heavy shadow
across his eyes Around his neck and over his open blue flannel
shirt lay loosely a knotted silk kerchief and on his thighs a pair of
openflapped holsters swung uneasily with their ivory handled burdens
He turned abruptly raised his gun to his shoulder and fired then
he laughed recklessly and patted his mount which responded to
the confident caress by lying flatter to the earth in a spurt of
heartbreaking speed

Ill show em who theyre trailin This is th second time Ive
started for Muddy Wells an Im goin to git there too for all th
Apaches out of Hades

To the south another cloud of dust rapidly approached and the rider
scanned it closely for it was directly in his path As he watched it
he saw something wave and it was a sombrero Shortly afterward a real
cowboy yell reached his ears He grinned and slid another cartridge in
the greasy smoking barrel of the Sharps and fired again at the cloud
in his rear Some few minutes later a whooping bunched crowd of madly
riding cowboys thundered past him and he was recognized

Hullo Frenchy yelled the nearest one Comin back

Come on McAllister shouted another well give em blazes In
response the straining broncho suddenly stiffened bunched and slid on
its haunches wheeled and retraced its course The rear cloud suddenly
scattered into many smaller ones and all swept off to the east The
rescuing band overtook them and several hours later when seated around
a table in Tom Lees saloon Muddy Wells a count was taken of them
which was pleasing in its facts

We was huntin coyotes when we saw yu said a smiling puncher who was
known as Salvation Carroll chiefly because he wasnt

Yep Theyve been stalkin Toms chickens supplied Waffles the
champion poker player of the outfit Tom Lees chickens could whip
anything of their kind for miles around and were reverenced accordingly

Sho Is that so Asked Frenchy with mild incredulity such a state of
affairs being deplorable

She shore is answered Tex Le Blanc and then as an afterthought he
added Whered yu hit th Warwhoops

Bout four hours back This heres th second time Ive headed for this
placelast time they chased me to Las Cruces

That so Asked Bigfoot Baker a giant Aint they allus interferin
now Anyhow theyre bettern coyotes

They was purty well heeled suggested Tex glancing at a bunch of
repeating Winchesters of late model which lay stacked in a corner
Charley here said he thought they was from th way yore cayuse looked
didnt yu Charley Charley nodded and filled his pipe

Pears like a feller cant amble around much nowadays without havin to
fight grumbled Lefty Allen who usually went out of his way hunting up
trouble

Were goin to th Hills as soon as our cookie turns up volunteered
Tenspot Davis looking inquiringly at Frenchy Heard any more news

Nope Same old storylots of gold Shucks Ive bit on so many of them
rumors that they dont feaze me no more One man who dont know nothin
about prospectin goes an stumbles over a fortune an those who know it
from A to Izzard goes round pullin in their belts

We dont pull in no beltswe knows just where to look dont we
Tenspot Remarked Tex looking very wise

Yaas we do answered Tenspot if yu hasnt dreamed about it we do

Yu wait I wasnt dreamin none whatever assured Tex

I saw it

Yaas I saw it too onct replied Frenchy with sarcasm Went and
lugged fifty pound of it all th way to th assay officetook me two
days an that there foureyed cuss looks at it and snickers Then
he takes me by di arm an leads me to th window See that pile my
friend Thats all like yourn sez he Its worth about one simoleon a
ton at th coast They use it for ballast

Aw But this what I saw was gold exploded Tex

So was mine for a while laughed Frenchy nodding to the bartender
for another round

Well were tired of punchin cows Ride sixteen hours a day year in
an year out an what do we get Fifty a month an no chance to spend
it an grub thatd make a coyote sniffle Im for a vacation an if I
goes broke why Ill punch again asserted Waffles the foreman thus
revealing the real purpose of the trip

Whatd yore boss say Asked Frenchy

Whoop What didnt he say Honest I never thought he had it in him
It was fine He cussed an hour frontways an then trailed back on a dead
gallop with us alaughin fit to bust Then he rustles for his gun an
we rustles for town answered Waffles laughing at his remembrance of
it

As Frenchy was about to reply his sombrero was snatched from his
head and disappeared If he got mad he was to be regarded as not
sufficiently well acquainted for banter and he was at once in hot water
if he took it goodnaturedly he was one of the crowd in spirit but in
either case he didnt get his hat without begging or fighting for
it This was a recognized custom among the OBarO outfit and was not
intended as an insult

Frenchy grabbed at the empty air and arose Punching Lefty playfully in
the ribs he passed his hands behind that persons back Not finding the
lost headgear he laughed and tripping Lefty up fell with him and
reaching up on the table for his glass poured the contents down Leftys
back and arose

Yu sonofagun indignantly wailed that unfortunate Gee it feels
funny he added grinning as he pulled the wet shirt away from his
spine

Well Ive got to be amblin said Frenchy totally ignoring the
loss of his hat Goin down to Buckskin he offered and then asked
Whens yore cook comin

Day after tomorrow if he dont get loaded replied Tex

Who is he

A oneeyed MexicanQuiensabe Antonio

I used to know him Hes a heck of a cook Dished up th grub one
season when I was punchin for th TinCup up in Montana replied
Frenchy

Oh he kin cook now all right replied Waffles

Thats about all he can cook Useter wash his knives in th coffee pot
an blow on di tins I chased him a mile one night for leavin sand in
th skillet Yu can have himI dont envy yu none whatever

He dont sand no skillet when little Tenspots around assured that
person slapping his holster Does he Lefty

If he does yu oughter be lynched consoled Lefty

Well so long remarked Frenchy riding off to a small store where he
bought a cheap sombrero

Frenchy was a jackofalltrades having been cowpuncher prospector
proprietor of a hotel in Albuquerque foreman of a ranch sheriff
and at one time had played angel to a venturesome but poor show troupe
Beside his versatility he was well known as the man who took the stage
through the Sioux country when no one else volunteered He could shoot
with the best but his one pride was the brand of poker he handed out
Furthermore he had never been known to take an unjust advantage over
any man and on the contrary had frequently voluntarily handicapped
himself to make the event more interesting But he must not be classed
as being hampered with selfrestraint

His reasons for making this trip were twofold he wished to see Buck
Peters the foreman of the Bar20 outfit as he and Buck had punched
cows together twenty years before and were firm friends the other was
that he wished to get square with Hopalong Cassidy who had decisively
cleaned him out the year before at poker Hopalong played either
in great good luck or the contrary while Frenchy played an even
consistent game and usually left off richer than when he began and this
decisive defeat bothered him more than he would admit even to himself

The roundup season was at hand and the Bar20 was short of ropers the
rumors of fresh gold discoveries in the Black Hills having drawn all the
more restless men north The outfit also had a slight touch of the gold
fever and only their peculiar loyalty to the ranch and the assurance
of the foreman that when the work was over he would accompany them kept
them from joining the rush of those who desired sudden and much wealth
as the necessary preliminary of painting some cow town in all the bang
up style such an event would call for Therefore they had been given
orders to secure the required assistance and they intended to do so
and were prepared to kidnap if necessary for the glamour of wealth and
the hilarity of the vacation made the hours falter in their speed

As Frenchy leaned back in his chair in Cowans saloon Buckskin early
the next morning planning to get revenge on Hopalong and then to
recover his sombrero he heard a medley of yells and whoops and soon the
door flew open before the strenuous and concentrated entry of a mass
of twisting and kicking arms and legs which magically found their
respective owners and reverted to the established order of things

When the alkali dust had thinned he saw seven cowpunchers sitting on
the prostrate form of another who was earnestly engaged in trying to
push Johnny Nelsons head out in the street with one foot as he voiced
his lucid opinion of things in general and the seven in particular
After Red Connors had been stabbed in the back several times by the
victims energetic elbow he ran out of the room and presently returned
with a pleased expression and a sombrero full of water his finger
plugging an old bullet hole in the crown

Is he any better Buck Anxiously inquired the man with the reservoir

About a dollars worth replied the foreman Jest put a little right
here he drawled as he pulled back the collar of the unfortunates
shirt

Ow wow WOW wailed the recipient heaving and straining The
unengaged leg was suddenly wrested loose and as it shot up and out
Billy Williams with his pessimism aroused to a blueribbon pitch sat
down forcibly in an adjacent part of the room from where he lectured
between gasps on the follies of mankind and the attributes of army
mules

Red tiptoed around the squirming bunch looking for an opening his
pleased expression now having added a grin

Seems to be gittin violentlike he soliloquized as he aimed a
stream at Hopalongs ear which showed for a second as Pete Wilson
strove for a halfnelson and he managed to include Johnny and Pete in
his effort

Several minutes later when the storm had subsided the woeful crowd
enthusiastically urged Hopalong to the bar where he bought

Of all th ornery outfits I ever saw began the man at the table
grinning from ear to ear at the spectacle he had just witnessed

Why hullo Frenchy Glad to see yu yu old sonofagun Whats th
news from th Hills Shouted Hopalong

Rather locoed an theres a locoed gang thats headin that way Goin
up he asked

Shore after roundup Seen any punchers trailin around loose

Yaas drawled Frenchy delving into the possibilities suddenly opened
to him and determining to utilize to the fullest extent the opportunity
that had come to him unsought Theres nine over to Muddy Wells that yu
might git if yu wants them bad enough Theyve got a sombrero of mine
he added deprecatingly

Nine Twisted Jerusalem Buck Nine whole cowpunchers apinin for
work he shouted but then added thoughtfully Mebby theys engaged
it being one of the courtesies of the land not to take another mans
help

Nope Theyve stampeded for th Hills an left their boss all alone
replied Frenchy well knowing that such desertion would not in the
minds of the Bar20 men add any merits to the case of the distant
outfit

Th sonsofguns said Hopalong lets go an get em he suggested
turning to Buck who nodded a smiling assent

Oh whats the hurry Asked Frenchy seeing his projected game
slipping away into the uncertain future and happy in the thought that he
would be avenged on the OBarO outfit

Theyll be there till tomorrow noontheys waitin for their cookie
whos goin with them

A cook A cook Oh joy a cook exulted Johnny not for one instant
doubting Bucks ability to capture the whole outfit and seeing a whirl
of excitement in the effort

Anybody we knows Inquired Skinny Thompson

Shore Tenspot Davis Waffles Salvation Carroll Bigfoot Baker
Charley Lane Lefty Allen Kid Morris Curley Tate an Tex Le Blanc
responded Frenchy

Ummm Might as well rope a blizzard grumbled Billy Might as well
try to git th Seventh Cavalry Well have a pious time corralling that
bunch Thems th fellows that hit that bunch of inquirin Crow braves
that time up in th Bad Lands an then said bybye to th Ninth

Aw shut up Theys only two thats very much an Buck an Hopalong
can sing em to sleep interposed Johnny afraid that the expedition
would fall through

How about Curley and Tex Pugnaciously asked Billy

Huh jest because they buffaloed yu over to Las Vegas yu neednt think
theys dangerous Salvation an Tenspot are only ones who can shoot
stoutly maintained Johnny

Here yu get mum ordered Buck to the pair When this outfit goes
after anything it generally gets it All in favor of kidnappin that
outfit signify di same by kickin Billy whereupon Bill swore

Do yu want yore hat Asked Buck turning to Frenchy

I shore do answered that individual

If yu helps us at th roundup well get it for yu Fifty a month an
grub offered the foreman

OK replied Frenchy anxious to even matters

Buck looked at his watch Seven oclockwe ought to get there by five
if we relays at th BarredHorseshoe Come on

How are we goin to git them Asked Billy

Yu leave that to me son Hopalong an Frenchyll tend to that part of
it replied Buck making for his horse and swinging into the saddle an
example which was followed by the others including Frenchy

As they swung off Buck noticed the condition of Frenchys mount and
halted Yu take that cayuse back an get Cowans he ordered

That cayuse is good for Cheyenneshe eats work an besides I wants my
own laughed Frenchy

Yu must had a reglar picnic from th looks of that crease
volunteered Hopalong whose curiosity was mastering him Shoo I had
a little argument with some feather dustersth OBarO crowd cleaned
them up

That so Asked Buck

Yep They sorter got into th habit of chasin me to Las Cruces an
forgot to stop

How manyd yu get Asked Lanky Smith

Twelve Two got away I got two before th crowd showed upthat makes
foteen

Now th cavalryll be huntin yu croaked Billy

Hunt nothin They was in warpaintthink I was a targetThink I was
goin to call off their shots for em

They relayed at the BarredHorseshoe and went on their way at the same
pace Shortly after leaving the lastnamed ranch Buck turned to Frenchy
and asked Any of that outfit think they can play poker

Shore Waffles

Does th reverend Mr Waffles think so very hard

He shore does

Do th rest of them mavericks think so too

Theyd bet their shirts on him

At this juncture all were startled by a sudden eruption from Billy
Haw Haw Haw he roared as the drift of Bucks intentions struck him
Haw Haw Haw

Here yu longwinded coyote yelled Red banging him over the head
with his quirt If yu dont Haw Haw away from my ear Ill make it
a Wow Wow What dyu mean Think I am a echo cliff Yu slabsided
doodlebug yu

Gway yu crimson topknot think my heads a hunk of quartz Fer a
plugged peso Id strew yu all over th scenery shouted Billy feigning
anger and rubbing his head

There aint no scenery around here interposed Lanky This here
beutiful prospect is a sublime conception of th devil

Easy boy Them highfalutin wordsil give yu a cramp some day Yu talk
like a newlymade sergeant remarked Skinny

He learned them words from the skypilot over at El Paso volunteered
Hopalong winking at Red He used to amble down th aisle afore the
lights was lit sos he could get a front seat That was all hunky for
a while but every time hed go out to irrigate that female
organwrastler would seem to call th music off for his special benefit
So in a month hed sneak in an freeze to a chair by th door an after
a while hed shy like blazes every time he got within eye range of th
church

Shore But do yu know what made him get religion all of a sudden He
used to hang around on di outside after th joint let out an trail
along behind di musicslinger lookin like he didnt know what to do
with his hands Then when he got woozy one time she up an told him that
she had got a nice long letter from her hubby Then Mr Lanky hit th
trail for Santa Fe so hard that there wasnt hardly none of it left I
didnt see him for a whole month supplied Red innocently

Yore shore funny aint yu sarcastically grunted Lanky Why I can
tell things on yu thatd make yu stand treat for a year

I wouldnt sneak off to Santa Fe an cheat yu out of them Yu ought to
be ashamed of yoreself

Yah snorted the aggrieved little man I had business over to Santa
Fe

Shore endorsed Hopalong Weve all had business over to Santa Fe
Why about eight years ago I had business

Choke up interposed Red About eight years ago yu was washin pans
for cookie an askin me for cartridges Buck used to larrup yu about
four times a day eight years ago

To their roars of laughter Hopalong dropped to the rear where
redfaced and quiet he bent his thoughts on how to get square

Well have a pleasant time corralling that gang began Billy for the
third time

For heavens sake get off that trail replied Lanky We aint goin to
hold em up Deplomacys th game

Billy looked dubious and said nothing If he hadnt proven that he was
as nervy as any man in the outfit they might have taken more stock in
his grumbling

Whats the latest from Abilene way Asked Buck of Frenchy

Nothin much cept th barbwire ruction replied the recruit

Whats that Asked Red glancing apprehensively back at Hopalong

Why th settlers put up barbwire fence sos the cattle wouldnt get
on their farms That would a been all right for there wasnt much of
it But some Britishers who own a couple of big ranches out there got
smart all of a sudden an strung wire all along their lines Punchers
crossin th country would run plumb into a fence an would have to ride
a day an a half mebbe afore they found th corner Well naturally
when a man has been used to ridin where he blame pleases an as
straight as he pleases he aint goin to chase along a fivefoot fence
to Trisco when he wants to get to Waco So th punchers got to totin
wiresnips an when they runs up agin a fence they cuts down half a
mile or so Sometimes theyd tie their ropes to a strand an pull off a
couple of miles an then go back after th rest Th ranch bosses sent
out men to watch th fences an told em to shoot any festive puncher
that monkeyed with th hardware Well yu know what happens when a
puncher gets shot at

When fences grow in Texas therell be th devil to pay said Buck He
hated to think that some day the freedom of the range would be annulled
for he knew that it would be the first blow against the cowboys
occupation When a mans cattle couldnt spread out all over the land he
wouldnt have to keep so many men Farms would spring up and the sun of
the freeandeasy cowboy would slowly set

I reckons th cutters are classed th same as rustlers remarked Red
with a gleam of temper

By th owners but not by th punchers an its th punchers that
count replied Frenchy

Well well give them a fight interposed Hopalong riding up When
it gets so I cant go where I please Ill start on th warpath I wont
buck the cavalry but Ill keep it busy huntin for me an Ill have
time to tend to th wirefence men too Why well be told we cant
tote our guns

Theyre sayin that now replied Frenchy Up in Buffalo Smith whos
now marshal makes yu leave em with th bartenders

Id like to see any twolaigged cuss get my guns If I didnt want him
to began Hopalong indignant at the idea

Easy son cautioned Buck Yu would do what th rest did because yu
are a square man Im about as hardheaded a puncher as ever straddled
leather an Ive had to use my guns purty considerable but I reckons if
any decent marshal asked me to cache them in a decent way why Id
do it An let me brand somethin on yore mindIve heard of Smith of
Buffalo an hes mighty nifty with his hands He dont stand off an
tell yu to unload yore leadranch but he ambles up close an taps yu
on yore shirt if yu makes a gunplay he naturally knocks yu clean across
th room an unloads yu afore yu gets yore senses back He weighs about
a hundred an eighty an hes shore got sand to burn

Yah When I makes a gun play she plays Id look nice in Abilene or
Paso or Albuquerque without my guns wouldnt I Just because I totes
them in plain sight Ive got to hand em over to some liquorwrastler I
reckons not Some hippocket skunk would plug me afore I could wink Id
shore look nice loping around a keno layout without my guns in th
same town with some cuss huntin me wouldnt I A whole lot of good a
marshal would a done Jimmy an didnt Harris get his from a cur in th
dark shouted Hopalong angered by the prospect

Were talkin about Buffalo where everybody has to hang up their
guns replied Buck An theres th law

To blazes with th law whooped Hopalong in Reds ear as he
unfastened the cinch of Reds saddle and at the same time stabbing that
unfortunates mount with his spurs thereby causing a hasty separation
of the two When Red had picked himself up and things had quieted down
again the subject was changed and several hours later they rode into
Muddy Wells a town with a little more excuse for its existence than
Buckskin The wells were in an arid valley west of Guadaloupe Pass and
were not only muddy but more or less alkaline



CHAPTER X Peace Hath its Victories


As they neared the central group of buildings they heard a hilarious
and assertive song which sprang from the door and windows of the main
saloon It was in jig time rollicking and boisterous but the words had
evidently been improvised for the occasion as they clashed immediately
with those which sprang to the minds of the outfit although they could
not be clearly distinguished As they approached nearer and finally
dismounted however the words became recognizable and the visitors were
at once placed in harmony with the air of jovial recklessness by the
roaring of the verses and the stamping of the time

 Oh were redhot cowpunchers playin on our luck
 An there aint a proposition that we wont buck
 From sunrise to sunset weve ridden on the range
 But now were oft for a howlin change

CHORUS

 Laugh a little sing a little all th day
 Play a little drink a littlewe can pay
 Ride a little dig a little an rich well grow
 Oh were that bunch from th OBarO

 Oh there was a little tenderfoot an he had a little gun
 An th gun an him went atrailin up some fun
 They ambles up to Santa Fe to find a quiet game
 An now theyre planted with some more of th same

As Hopalong followed by the others pushed open the door and entered
he took up the chorus with all the power of Texan lungs and even Billy
joined in The sight that met their eyes was typical of the men and the
mood and the place Leaning along the walls lounging on the table and
straddling chairs with their forearms crossed on the backs were nine
cowboys ranging from old twenty to young fifty in years and all were
shouting the song and keeping time with their hands and feet

In the center of the room was a large man dancing a fair buckandwing
to the time so uproariously set by his companions Hatless
neckkerchief loose holsters flapping chaps rippling out and close
spurs clinking and perspiration streaming from his tanned face danced
Bigfoot Baker as though his life depended on speed and noise Bottles
shook and the air was fogged with smoke and dust Suddenly his belt
slipping and letting his chaps fall around his ankles he tripped and
sat down heavily Gasping for breath he held out his hand and received
a huge plug of tobacco for Bigfoot had won a contest

Shouts of greeting were hurled at the newcomers and many questions were
fired at them regarding th latest from th Hills Waffles made a rush
for Hopalong but fell over Bigfoots feet and all three were piled up
in a heap All were beaming with good nature for they were as so many
school boys playing truant Prosaic cowpunching was relegated to the
rear and they looked eagerly forward to their several missions Frenchy
told of the barbwire fence war and of the new regulations of Smith
of Buffalo regarding cowpunchers guns and from the caustic remarks
explosively given it was plain to be seen what a wire fence could
expect should one be met with and there were many imaginary Smiths put
hors de combat

Kid Morris after vainly trying to slip a bluebottle fly inside of
Hopalongs shirt gave it up and slammed his hand on Hopalongs back
instead crying Well Ill be doggoned if here aint Hopalong Hows
th missus an th deacon an all th folks to hum I hears yu an
Frenchys reglar poker fiends

Oh we plays onct in a while but we dont want none of yore dust
Yull shore need it all afore th Hills get through with yu laughingly
replied Hopalong

Oh yore shore kind But I was a sort of reckonin that we needs some
more Perfesser P D Q Waffles is our poker man an he shore can clean
out anything I ever saw Mebbe yu fellers feel recklesslike an would
like to make a pool he cried addressing the outfit of the Bar20
an back yore boss of th full house agin ourn

Red turned slowly around and took a full minute in which to size the Kid
up Then he snorted and turned his back again

The Kid stared at him in outraged dignity Well what say he softly
murmured Then he leaped forward and walloped Red on the back
Hey yore royal highness he shouted Yuyuyuoh hang ityu Yu
slabsided ringboned saddlegalled shade of a coyote do yu think Im
only meanderin in th misty vales ofof

Suggestions intruded from various sources Hades offered Hopalong
Cheyenne Murmured Johnny Misty mistiness of misty tentatively
supplied Waffles

Red turned around again Better come up an have somethin he
sympathetically invited wiping away an imaginary tear

An hes so young sobbed Frenchy

An so fair wailed Tex

An so ornery howled Lefty throwing his arms around the discomfited
youngster Other arms went around him and out of the sobbing mob could
be heard earnest and heartfelt cussing interspersed with imperative
commands which were gradually obeyed

The Kid straightened up his wearing apparel Come on yu locoed

Angels Queried Charley Lane interrupting him Sweet things
breathed Hopalong in hopeful expectancy

Oh blast it yelled the Kid as he ran out into the street to escape
the persecution

Good Kid all right remarked Waffles Hell go around an lick some
Mexican an come back sweet as honey

Did somebody say poker Asked Bigfoot digressing from the Kid

Oh yu fellows dont want no poker Of course yu dont Pokers mighty
uncertain replied Red

Yah exclaimed Tex Le Blanc pushing forward Ill just bet yu to
a standstill that Waffles an Salvationll round up all th festive
simoleons yu can get together An Ill throw in Frenchys hat as an
inducement

Well if yore shore set on it make her a pool replied Red an th
winners divide with their outfit Heres a starter he added tossing a
buckskin bag on the table Come on pile em up

The crowd divided as the players seated themselves at the table the
OBarO crowd grouping themselves behind their representatives the
Bar20 behind theirs A deck of cards was brought and the game was on

Red true to his nature leaned back in a corner where hands on hips
he awaited any hostile demonstration on the part of the OBarO then
suddenly remembering he looked half ashamed of his warlike position and
became a peaceful citizen again Buck leaned with his broad back against
the bar talking over his shoulder to the bartender but watching
Tenspot Davis who was assiduously engaged in juggling a handful of
Mexican dollars

Up by the door Bigfoot Baker elated at winning the buckandwing
contest was endeavoring to learn a new step while his late rival was
drowning his defeat at Bucks elbow Lefty Allen was softly singing a
Mexican love song humming when the words would not come At the
table could be heard lowspoken card terms and goodnatured banter
interspersed with the clink of gold and silver and the soft patpat
of the onlookers feet unconsciously keeping time to Leftys song
Notwithstanding the grim assertiveness of belts full of 45s and the
peeping handles of longbarreled Colts set off with picturesque chaps
sombreros and tinkling spurs the scene was one of peaceful content and
goodfellowship

Ugh grunted Johnny walking over to Red and informing that person
that he Red was a wormeaten prune and that for half a wink he
Johnny would prove it Red grabbed him by the seat of his corduroys
and the collar of his shirt and helped him outside where they strolled
about taking pot shots at whatever their fancy suggested

Down the street in a cloud of dust rumbled the Las CrucesEl Paso stage
and the two punchers went up to meet it Raw furrows showed in the
woodwork one mule was missing and the driver and guard wore fresh
bandages A tired tenderfoot leaped out with a sigh of relief and hunted
for his baggage which he found to be generously perforated Swearing
at the Godforsaken land where a man had to fight highwaymen and
Indians inside of half a day he grumblingly lugged his valise toward a
forbiddinglooking shack which was called a hotel

The driver released his teams and then turned to Red Hullo old hoss
hows th gang he asked genially Weve had a heck of a time this
yere trip he went on without waiting for Red to reply Five miles out
of Las Cruces we stood off a sonofagun that wanted th dudes wealth
Then just this side of the San Andre foothills we runs into a bunch of
young bucks who turned us off this yere way an gave us a runnin fight
purty near all th way Im a whole lot farther from Paso now than I
was when I started an seem as I lost a jack Ill be some time gittin
there Yu dont happen to sabe a jack I can borrow do yu

I dont know about no jack but Ill rope yu a bronch offered Red
winking at Johnny

Ill pull her myself before Ill put dynamite in di traces replied
the driver Yu fellers might amble back a ways with methem buddin
warriorsll be layin for me

We shore will responded Johnny eagerly Theres nine of us now an
therell be nine more an a cook tomorrow mebby

Gosh yu grows some replied the guard Eighteenll be a plenty for
them glory hunters

We wont be able to contradicted Red for things are peculiar

At this moment the conversation was interrupted by the tenderfoot who
sported a new and cheap sombrero and also a belt and holster complete

Will you gentlemen join me He asked turning to Red and nodding at
the saloon I am very dry and much averse to drinking alone

Why shore responded Red heartily wishing to put the stranger at
ease

The game was running about even as they entered and Lefty Allen was
singing The Insult the rich tenor softening the harshness of the
surroundings


 Ive swum th Colorado where shes almost lost to view Ive braced
 th Jaro layouts in Cheyenne

 Ive fought for muddy water with a howlin bunch of Sioux An
 swallowed hot tamales an cayenne

 Ive rid a pitchin broncho till th sky was underneath Ive
 tackled every desert in th land

 Ive sampled XXXX whiskey till I couldnt hardly see An dallied
 with th quicksands of the Grande

 Ive argued with th marshals of a halfadozen burgs Ive been
 dragged free an fancy by a cow

 Ive had three years campaignin with th fightin bitin Ninth
 An never lost my temper till right now

 Ive had the yaller fever an Ive been shot full of holes Ive
 grabbed an army mule plumb by its tail

 Ive never been so snortin really highfalutin mad As when yu up
 an hands me ginger ale

Hopalong laughed joyously at a remark made by Waffles and the stranger
glanced quickly at him His merry boyish face underlined by a
jaw showing great firmness and set with an expression of aggressive
selfreliance impressed the stranger and he remarked to Red who
lounged lazily near him that he was surprised to see such a face on so
young a man and he asked who the player was

Oh his names Hopalong Cassidy answered Red Hes di cuss that
raised that ruction down in Mexico last spring Rode his cayuse in a
saloon and played with the loungers and had to shoot one before he got
out When he did get out he had to fight a whole bunch of Mexicans an
even potted their marshal who had di drop on him Then he returned and
visited the marshal about a month later took his gun away from him
an then cut th cards to see if he was a prisoner or not Hes a shore
funny cuss

The tenderfoot gasped his amazement Are you not fooling with me He
asked

Tell him yu came after that five hundred dollars reward and see
answered Red goodnaturedly

Holy smoke shouted Waffles as Hopalong won his sixth consecutive pot
Did yu ever see such luck Frenchy grinned and some time later raked
in his third Salvation then staked his last cent against Hopalongs
flush and dropped out

Tenspot flipped to Waffles the money he had been juggling and Lefty
searched his clothes for wealth Buck still leaning against the bar
grinned and winked at Johnny who was pouring hairraising tales into
the receptive ears of the stranger Thereupon Johnny confided to his
newly found acquaintance the facts about the game nearly causing that
person to explode with delight

Waffles pushed back his chair stood up and stretched At the finish
of a yawn he grinned at his late adversary Im all in yu old
sonofagun Yu shore can play draw Im goin to try yu again some
time I was beat fair an square an I aint got no kick comin none
whatever he remarked as he shook hands with Hopalong

Oh were that gang from th OBarO hummed the Kid as he sauntered
in One cheek was slightly swollen and his clothes shed dust at every
step Who wins he inquired not having heard Waffles

They did blast it exploded Bigfoot

One of the Kids peculiarities was revealed in the unreasoning and
hasty conclusions he arrived at From no desire to imply unfairness
but rather because of his bitterness against failure of any kind and his
loyalty to Waffles came his next words

Mebby they skinned yu

Like a flash Waffles sprang before him his hand held up palm out He
dont mean nothinhes only a ignorant kid he cried

Buck smiled and wrested the Colt from Johnnys everready hand Heres
another he said Red laughed softly and rolled Johnny on the floor
Yu jackass he whispered dont yu know bettern to make a gunplay
when we needs them all

What are we goin to do Asked Tex glancing at the bulging pockets of
Hopalongs chaps

Were goin to punch cows again thats what were to do answered
Bigfoot dismally

An whose are we goin to punch We cant go back to the old man
grumbled Tex

Salvation looked askance at Buck and then at the others Mebby he
began Mebby we kin git a job on th Bar20 Then turning to Buck
again he bluntly asked Are yu short of punchers

Well I might use some answered the foreman hesitating But
 I aint got only one cook an

Well git yu th cook all OK interrupted Charley Lane vehemently
Hi yu cook he shouted amble in here an git a rustle on

There was no reply and after waiting for a minute he and Waffles went
into the rear room from which there immediately issued great chunks
of profanity and noise They returned looking pugnacious and disgusted
with a wildly fighting man who was more full of liquor than was the
bottle which he belligerently waved

This here animated distillery what yu sees is our cook said Waffles
We eats his grub nobody else If he gits drunk thats our funeral but
he wont get drunk If yu wants us to punch for yu say so an we does
if yu dont we dont

Well replied Buck thoughtfully mebby I can use yu Then with a
burst of recklessness he added Yes if I lose my job But yu might
sober that Mexican up if yu let him fall in th horse trough

As the procession wended its way on its mission of wet charity carrying
the cook in any manner at all Frenchy waved his long lost sombrero
at Buck who stood in the door and shouted Yu old sonofagun Im
proud to know yu

Buck smiled and snapped his watch shut Time to amble he said



CHAPTER XI Holding the Claim


Oh were that gang from th OBarO hummed Waffles sinking the
brandingiron in the flank of a calf The scene was one of great
activity and hilarity Several fires were burning near the huge corral
and in them half a dozen irons were getting hot Three calves were being
held down for the brand of the Bar20 and two more were being dragged
up on their sides by the ropes of the cowboys the proud cowponies
showing off their accomplishments at the expense of the calves
feelings In the corral the dust arose in steady clouds as calf after
calf was cut out by the ropers and dragged out to get tagged Angry
cows fought valiantly for their terrorized offspring but always to no
avail for the hated rope of some perspiring and dustgrimed rider sent
them crashing to earth Over the plain were herds of cattle and groups
of madly riding cowboys and two cook wagons were stalled a short
distance from the corral The roundup of the Bar20 was taking place
and each of the two outfits tried to outdo the other and each individual
strove for a prize The man who cut out and dragged to the fire the most
calves in three days could leave for the Black Hills at the expiration
of that time the rest to follow as soon as they could

In this contest Hopalong Cassidy led his nearest rival Red Connors
both of whom were Bar20 men by twenty cutouts and there remained but
half an hour more in which to compete As Red disappeared into the sea
of tossing horns Hopalong dashed out with a whoop

 Hi yu trellisbuilt rack of bones come along there Whoop he
yelled turning the prisoner over to the squad by the fire

Chalk up this here insignificant wart of crosseyed perversity an how
many He called as he galloped back to the corral

One ninetyeight announced Buck blowing the sand from the tally
sheet Thats shore goin some he remarked to himself

When the calf sprang up it was filled with terror rage and pain and
charged at Billy from the rear as that pessimistic soul was leaning over
and poking his finger at a somber hornedtoad Wow he yelled as his
feet took huge steps up in the air each one strictly on its own course
Woof he grunted in the hot sand as he arose on his hands and knees
and spat alkali

Whats smatter He asked dazedly of Johnny Nelson Aint it funny
he yelled sarcastically as he beheld Johnny holding his sides with
laughter Aint it funny he repeated belligerently Of course that
fourlaigged knockkneed wobblin sonofaPiute had to cut me out
They wasnt nobody in sight but Billy Why didnt yu say he was comin
Think I can see four ways to once Why didnt At this point Red
cantered up with a calf and by a quick maneuver drew the taut rope
against the rear of Billys knees causing that unfortunate to sit down
heavily As he arose choking with brokenwinded profanity Red dragged
the animal to the fire and Billy forgot his grievances in the press of
labor

How many Buck Asked Red

Oneeighty

How does she stand

Yore eighteen to th bad replied the foreman Th sonofagun
marveled Red riding off

Another whoop interrupted them and Billy quit watching out of the
corner eye for pugnacious calves as he prepared for Hopalong

Hey Buck this here cuss was with a BarredHorseshoe cow he
announced as he turned it over to the branding man Buck made a tally in
a separate column and released the animal Hullo Red Workin Asked
Hopalong of his rival

Some yu little cuss answered Red with all the good nature in the
world Hopalong was his particular side partner and he could lose to
him with the best of feelings

Yu looks so nice an cool an clean I didnt know responded
Hopalong eyeing a streak of sweat and dust which ran from Reds eyes to
his chin and then on down his neck

What yu been doin Plowin with yore nose Returned Red smiling
blandly at his friends appearance

Yah snorted Hopalong wheeling toward the corral Come on yu
pieeatin doodlebug Ill beat yu to th gate

The two ponies sent showers of sand all over Billy who eyed them
in pugnacious disgust Of all th locoed imps that ever made life
miserable fer a man thems th worst Is there any piece of fool
nonsense they haint harnessed me with He beseeched of Buck Is there
anything they haint done to me They hides my liquor they stuffs th
sweat band of my hat with rope they ties up my pants they puts water
in My boots an toads in my bunkaint they never goin to get sane

Oh theyre only kidsthey cant help it offered Buck Didnt they
hobble my cayuse when I was on him an near bust my neck

Hopalong interrupted the conversation by driving up another calf and
Buck glancing at his watch declared the contest at an end

Yu wins he remarked to the newcomer An now yu get scarce or Billy
will shore straddle yore nerves He said as how he was goin to get
square on yu tonight

I didnt neither Hoppy earnestly contradicted Billy who bad
visions of a night spent in torment as a reprisal for such a threat
Honest I didnt did I Johnny He asked appealingly

Yu shore did lied Johnny winking at Red who had just ridden up

I dont know what yore talkin about but yu shore did replied Red

If yu did grinned Hopalong Ill shore make yu hard to find Come
on fellows he said grubs ready Wheres Frenchy

Over chewin th rag with Waffles about his hathes lost it again
answered Red He needs a guardian fer that bonnet Th Kid an
Salvation has jammed it in th corral fence an Waffles has to stand fer
it

Lets put it in th grub wagon an see him cuss cookie suggested
Hopalong

Shore indorsed Johnny Cookiell feed him bum grub for a week to get
square

Hopalong and Johnny ambled over to the corral and after some trouble
located the missing sombrero which they carried to the grub wagon and
hid in the flour barrel Then they went over by the excited owner and
dropped a few remarks about how strange the cook was acting and how he
was watching Frenchy

Frenchy jumped at the bait and tore over to the wagon where he and the
cook spent some time in mutual recrimination Hopalong nosed around and
finally dug up the hat white as newfallen snow

Heres a hatfound it in th dough barrel he announced handing it
over to Frenchy who received it in openmouthed stupefaction

Yu piemakin pirate Yu didnt know where my lid was did yu Yu
crosseyed lump of hypocrisy yelled Frenchy dusting off the flour
with one fullarmed swing on the cooks face driving it into that
unfortunates nose and eyes and mouth Yu whitewashed Chink yurub
yore face with water an yuve got pancakes

Hey What you doin yelled the cook kicking the spot where he had
last seen Frenchy Dont yu know bettern that

Yu live close to yoreself or Ill throw yu so high th sunll duck
replied Frenchy a smile illuminating his face

Hey cookie remarked Hopalong confidentially I know who put up this
joke on yu Yu ask Billy who hid th hat suggested the tease Here he
comes nowsee how queer he looks

Th mournful Piute ejaculated the cook Ill shore make him wish
hed kept on his own trail Ill flavor his slush coffee with yearold
dishrags

At this juncture Billy ambled up keeping his weather eye peeled for
trouble Whos a dishrag He queried The cook mumbled something
about crazy hens not knowing when to quit cackling and climbed up in his
wagon And that night Billy swore off drinking coffee

When the dawn of the next day broke Hopalong was riding toward the
Black Hills leaving Billy to untie himself as best he might

The trip was uneventful and several weeks later he entered Red Dog a
rambling shanty town one of those western mushrooms that sprang up in a
night He took up his stand at the Miners Rest and finally secured
six claims at the cost of nine hundred hardearned dollars a fund
subscribed by the outfits as it was to be a partnership affair

He rode out to a stakedoff piece of hillside and surveyed his purchase
which consisted of a patch of ground six holes six piles of dirt and
a log hut The holes showed that the claims bad been tried and found
wanting

He dumped his pack of tools and provisions which he had bought on the
way up and lugged them into the cabin After satisfying his curiosity
he went outside and sat down for a smoke figuring up in his mind how
much gold he could carry on a horse Then as he realized that he could
get a pack mule to carry the surplus he became aware of a strange
presence near at hand and looked up into the muzzle of a Sharps rifle
He grasped the situation in a flash and calmly blew several heavy smoke
rings around the frowning barrel

Well He asked slowly

Nice day stranger replied the man with the rifle but dont yu
reckon yuve made a mistake

Hopalong glanced at the number burned on a nearby stake and carelessly
blew another smoke ring He was waiting for the gun to waver

No I reckons not he answered Why

Well Ill jest tell yu since yu asks This yere claims mine an Im
a reglar terror I am Thats why an seein as it is yu better amble
some

Hopalong glanced down the street and saw an interested group watching
him which only added to his rage for being in such a position Then
he started to say something faltered and stared with horror at a point
several feet behind his opponent The terror sprang to one side in
response to Hopalongs expression as if fearing that a snake or some
such danger threatened him As he alighted in his new position he fell
forward and Hopalong slid a smoking Colt in its holster

Several men left the distant group and ran toward the claim Hopalong
reached his arm inside the door and brought forth his rifle with which
he covered their advance

Anything yu want he shouted savagely

The men stopped and two of them started to sidle in front of two others
but Hopalong was not there for the purpose of permitting a move that
would screen any gun play and he stopped the game with a warning shout
Then the two held up their hands and advanced

We wants to git Dan called out one of them nodding at the prostrate
figure

Come ahead replied Hopalong substituting a Colt for the rifle


They carried their badly wounded and insensible burden back to those
whom they had left and several curses were hurled at the cowboy who
only smiled grimly and entered the hut to place things ready for a
siege should one come He had one hundred rounds of ammunition and
provisions enough for two weeks with the assurance of reinforcements
long before that time would expire He cut several rough loopholes and
laid out his weapons for quick handling He knew that he could stop any
advance during the day and planned only for night attacks How long
he could go without sleep did not bother him because he gave it no
thought as he was accustomed to short naps and could awaken at will or
at the slightest sound

As dusk merged into dark he crept forth and collected several handfuls
of dry twigs which he scattered around the hut as the cracking of
these would warn him of an approach Then he went in and went to sleep

He awoke at daylight after a good nights rest and feasted on canned
beans and peaches Then he tossed the cans out of the door and shoved
his hat out Receiving no response he walked out and surveyed the town
at his feet A sheepish grin spread over his face as he realized that
there was no danger Several redshirted men passed by him on their way
to town and one a grizzled veteran of many gold camps stopped and
sauntered up to him

Mornin said Hopalong

Mornin replied the stranger I thought Id drop in an say that I
saw that gunplay of yourn yesterday Yu aint got no reason to look fer
a rush This camp is half white men an half bullies an th white men
wont stand fer no play like that Them fellers that jest passed are
neighbors of yourn an they wont lay abed if yu needs them But yu
wants to look out fer th joints in th town Guess this business is out
of yore line he finished as he sized Hopalong up

She shore is but Im here to stay Got tired of punchin an reckoned
Id get rich Here he smiled and glanced at the hole Howre yu makin
out He asked

Bout five dollars a day apiece but that aint nothin when grubs so
high Got reckless th other day an had a egg at fifty cents

Hopalong whistled and glanced at the empty cans at his feet Any
marshal in this burg

Yep But hes one of th gang No good an drunk half th time an
half drunk th rest Better come down an have something invited the
miner

Id shore like to but I cant let no gang get in that door replied
the puncher

Oh thats all right Ill call my pardner down to keep house till yu
gits back He can hold her all right Hey Jake he called to a man who
was some hundred paces distant Come down here an keep house till we
gits back will yu

The man lumbered down to them and took possession as Hopalong and his
newly found friend started for the town

They entered the Miners Rest and Hopalong fixed the room in his mind
with one swift glance Three menand they looked like the crowd he had
stopped beforewere playing poker at a table near the window Hopalong
leaned with his back to the bar and talked with the players always in
sight

Soon the door opened and a bewhiskered heavyset man tramped in and
walking up to Hopalong looked him over

Huh he sneered Yu are th gent with th festive guns that plugged
Dan aint yu

Hopalong looked at him in the eyes and quietly replied

An who th deuce are yu

The strangers eyes blazed and his face wrinkled with rage as he
aggressively shoved his jaw close to Hopalongs face

Yu runt Im a better man than yu even if yu do wear hair pants
referring to Hopalongs chaps Yu cowwrastlers make me tired an Im
goin to show yu that this town is too good for you Yu can say it right
now that yu are a ornery gameleg

Hopalong smashed his insulter squarely between the eyes with all the
power of his sinewy body behind the blow knocking him in a heap under
the table Then he quickly glanced at the card players and saw a hostile
movement His gun was out in a flash and he covered the trio as he
walked up to them Never in all his life had he felt such a desire to
kill His eyes were diamond points of accumulated fury and those whom
he faced quailed before him

Yu scum Draw please draw Pull yore guns an gimme my chance Three
to one an Ill lay my guns here he said placing them on the bar and
removing his hands Nearer My God to Thee is purty appropriate fer
yu just now Yu seem to be ascared of yore own guns Git down on yore
dirty knees an say good an loud that yu eats dirt Shout out that
yu are too currish to live with decent men he said eventoned and
distinct his voice vibrant with passion as he took up his Colts Get
down he repeated shoving the weapons forward and pulling back the
hammers

The trio glanced at each other and all three dropped to their knees and
repeated in venomous hatred the words Hopalong said for them

Now git An if I sees yu when I leaves Ill send yu after yore friend
Ill shoot on sight now Git He escorted them to the door and kicked
the last one out

His miner friend still leaned against the bar and looked his approval

Well done youngster But yu wants to look outthat man pointing to
the now groping victim of Hopalongs blow is th marshal of this town
He or his pals will get yu if yu dont watch th corners

Hopalong walked over to the marshal jerked him to his feet and slammed
him against the bar Then he tore the cheap badge from its place and
threw it on the floor Reaching down he drew the marshals revolver
from its holster and shoved it in its owners hand

Yore th marshal of this place an its too good for me but yore gain
to pick up that tin lie pointing at the badge an yore goin to do
it right now Then yore gain to get kicked out of that door an if
yu stops runnin while I can see yu Ill fill yu so full of holes yull
catch cold Yore a sumptious marshal yu are Yore th snortingest kiyi
that ever stuck its tail atween its laigs yu are Yu popeyed wall
flower yu wants to peep to yoreself or some papoosell slide yu over
th Divide so fast yu wont have time to grease yore pants Pick up that
licensetag an let me see you perculate so lively that yore backll
look like a tencent piece in five seconds Flit

The marshal dazed and bewildered stooped and fumbled for the badge
Then he stood up and glanced at the gun in his hand and at the eager man
before him He slid the weapon in his belt and drew his hand across his
fastclosing eyes Cursing streaks of profanity he staggered to the
door and landed in a heap in the street from the force of Hopalongs
kick Struggling to his feet he ran unsteadily down the block and
disappeared around a corner

The bartender cool and unperturbed pushed out three glasses on his
treat Ive seen yu afore up in Cheyennemember Hows yore friend
Red He asked as he filled the glasses with the best the house
afforded

Well shore nuff Glad to see yu Jimmy What yu doin away off here
Asked Hopalong beginning to feel at home

Oh jest filterin round like Im awful glad to see yuthis yere wart
of a town needs siftin out It was only last week I was wishin one of
yore bunch ud show upthat ornament yu jest buffaloed shore raised th
devil in here an I wished I had somebody to prospect his anatomy for a
lead mine But hes got a tough gang circulating with him Ever hear of
Dutch Shannon or Blinky Neary Theys with him

Dutch Shannon Nope he replied

yesterday was a bosom friend of th marshals an he passed in his
chips last night

So

Yep Bought a bottle of readymade nerve an went to his own funeral
Aristotle Smith was lookin fer him up in Cheyenne last year Aristotle
said hed give a century fer five minutes palaver with him but he
shied th town an didnt come back Yu know Aristotle dont yu Hes
th geezer that made fame up to Poison Knob three years ago He used to
go to town ridin astride a log on th lumber flume Made four miles in
six minutes with th promise of a ruction when he stopped Once when
he was loaded he tried to ride back th same way he came an th
first thing he knowed he was three miles farther from his supper an
aslippin down that valley like he wanted to go somewhere He swum out
at Potters Dam an it took him a day to walk back But he didnt make
that play again because he was frequently sober an when he wasnt
hed only stand off an swear at th slide

Thats Aristotle all hunk Hes th chap that used to play checkers
with Deacon Rawlins They used empty an loaded shells for men an when
they got a king theyd lay one on its side Sometimes theyd jar th
board an theyd all be kings an then theyd have a cussin match
replied Hopalong once more restored to good humor

Why responded Jimmy he counted his wealth over twice by mistake an
shore raised a howl when he went to blow itthought hes been robbed
an laid behind th houses fer a week lookin fer th feller that done
it

Ive heard of that cusshe shore was th limit What become of him
Asked the miner

He ambled up to Laramie an stuck his head in th window of that joint
by th plaza an hollered Fire an they did He was shore a good
feller all th same answered the bartender Hopalong laughed and
started for the door Turning around he looked at his miner friend and
asked Comin along Im goin back now

Nope Reckon Ill hit th tiger a whirl Ill stop in when I passes

All right So long replied Hopalong slipping out of the door and
watching for trouble There was no opposition shown him and he arrived
at his claim to find Jake in a heated argument with another of the gang

Here he comes now he said as Hopalong walked up Tell him what yu
said to me

I said yu made a mistake said the other turning to the cowboy in a
half apologetic manner

An what else Insisted Jake

Why aint that all Asked the claimjumpers friend in feigned
surprise wishing that he had kept quiet

Well I reckons it is if yu cant back up yore words responded Jake in
open contempt

Hopalong grabbed the intruder by the collar of his shirt and hauled him
off the claim Yu keep off this understand I just kicked yore marshal
out in th street an Ill pay yu th next call If yu rambles in range
of my guns yull shore get in th way of a slug Yu an yore gang wants
to browse on th far side of th range or yull miss a sunrise some
mornin Scoot

Hopalong turned to his companion and smiled Whatd he say He asked
genially

Oh he jest shot off his mouth a little Theys all no good Ive
collided with lots of them all over this country They cant face a good
man an keep their nerve Whatd yu say to th marshal

I told him what he was an threw him outen th street replied
Hopalong In about two weeks well have a new marshal an hell shore
be a dandy

Yes Why dont yu take th job yoreself Were with yu

Better man comin Ever hear of Buck Peters or Red Connors of th
Bar20 Texas

Buck Peters Seems to me I have Did he punch fer th TinCup up in
Montana bout twenty years back

Shore Him and Frenchy McAllister punched all over that country an
they used to paint Cheyenne too replied Hopalong eagerly

I knows him then I used to know Frenchy too Are they comin up
here

Yes responded Hopalong struggling with another can while waiting for
the fire to catch up Better have some grub with medont like to eat
alone invited the cowboy the reaction of his late rage swinging him
to the other extreme

When their tobacco had got well started at the close of the meal and
content had taken possession of them Hopalong laughed quietly and
finally spoke

Did yu ever know Aristotle Smith when yu was up in Montana

Did I Well me an Aristotle prospected all through that country till
he got so locoed I had to watch him fer fear hed blow us both up He
greased th fryin pan with dynamite one night an we shore had to eat
jerked meat an canned stuff all th rest of that trip What made yu
ask Is he comin up too

No I reckons not Jimmy th bartender said that he cashed in up
at Laramie Wasnt he th cuss that built that boat out there on th
Arizona desert because he was scared that a flood might come Th sun
shore warped that punt till it wasnt even good for a hencoop

Nope That was SisterAnnie Tompkins He was purty near as bad as
Aristotle though He roped a puma up on th Sacramentos an didnt
punch no more fer three weeks Well here comes my pardner an I reckons
Ill amble right along If yu needs any referee or a side pardner in any
ruction yu has only got to warble up my way So long

The next ten days passed quietly and on the afternoon of the eleventh
Hopalongs miner friend paid him a visit

Jake recommends yore peaches he laughed as he shook Hopalongs hand
He says yu boosted another of that crowd That bein so I thought I
would drop in an say that theyre comin after yu tonight shore Just
heard of it from yore friend Jimmy Yu can count on us when th rush
comes But why didnt yu say yu was a pard of Buck Peters Me an him
used to shoot up Laramie together From what yore friend James says yu
can handle this gang by yore lonesome but if yu needs any encouragement
yu make some sign an well help th event along some Theys eight of
us thatll be waitin up to get th returns an were shore goin to be
in range

Gee its nice to run across a friend of Bucks Aint he a
sonofagun Asked Hopalong delighted at the news Then without
waiting for a reply he went on Yore shore square all right an I
hates to refuse yore offer but I got eighteen friends comin up an
they ought to get here by tomorrow Yu tell Jimmy to head them this way
when they shows up an Ill have th claim for them There aint no
use of yu fellers gettin mixed up in this Th bunch thats comin can

anxious to begin when they finds me eatin peaches an wastin my time

lay low an see th Arory Boerallis hit this town with its tail up Tell
Jimmy to do it up good when he speaks about me holdin th claimI likes
to see Buck an Red fight when theyre good an mad

The miner laughed and slapped Hopalong on the shoulder Yore all right
youngster Yore just like Buck was at yore age Say now I reckons he
wasnt a reglar terror on wheels Why Ive seen him do more foolish
things than any man I knows of an I calculate that if Buck pals
with yu there aint no water in yore sand My names Tom Halloway he
suggested

An mines Hopalong Cassidy was the reply Ive heard Buck speak of
yu

Has yu Well dont it beat all how little this world is Somebody
allus turnin up that knows somebody yu knows Ill just amble along
Mr Cassidy an dont yu be none bashful about callin if yu needs me
Any pal of Bucks is my friend Well so long said the visitor as he
strode off Then he stopped and turned around Hey mister he
called They are goin to roll a fire barrel down agin yu from behind
indicating by an outstretched arm the point from where it would start
If it burns yu out Im goin to take a band from up there pointing to
a cluster of rocks well to the rear of where the crowd would work from
an I dont care whether yu likes it or not he added to himself

Hopalong scratched his head and then laughed Taking up a pick and
shovel he went out behind the cabin and dug a trench parallel with and
about twenty paces away from the rear wall Heaping the excavated dirt
up on the near side of the cut he stepped back and surveyed his labor
with open satisfaction Roll yore fire barrel an be dogged he
muttered Mebby she wont make a bully light for pot shots though he
added grinning at the execution he would do

Taking up his tools he went up to the place from where the gang would
roll the barrel and made half a dozen mounds of twigs being careful to
make them very flimsy Then he covered them with earth and packed
them gently The mounds looked very tempting from the viewpoint of a
marksman in search of earthworks and appeared capable of stopping any
rifle ball that could be fired against them Hopalong looked them over
critically and stepped back

Id like to see th look on th face of th sonofagun that uses them
for coverwont he be surprised and he grinned gleefully as he pictured
his shots boring through them Then he placed in the center of each a
chip or a pebble or something that he thought would show up well in the
firelight

Returning to the cabin he banked it up well with dirt and gravel
and tossed a few shovelfuls up on the roof as a safety valve to his
exuberance When he entered the door he had another idea and fell to
work scooping out a shallow cellar deep enough to shelter him when
lying at full length Then he stuck his head out of the window and
grinned at the false covers with their prominent bullseyes

When that prizewinnin gang of ossified idiots runs up agin these
fortifications they shore will be disgusted Ill bet four dollars an
seven cents theyll think their medicinemans no good I hopes that
puffeyed marshal will pick out that hump with th chip on it and he
hugged himself in anticipation

He then cut down a sapling and fastened it to the roof and on it he
tied his neckerchief which fluttered valiantly and with defiance in
the light breeze I shore hopes they appreciates that he remarked
whimsically as he went inside the hut and closed the door

The early part of the evening passed in peace and Hopalong tired of
watching in vain wished for action Midnight came and it was not until
half an hour before dawn that he was attacked Then a noise sent him to
a loophole where he fired two shots at skulking figures some distance
off A fusillade of bullets replied one of them ripped through the door
at a weak spot and drilled a hole in a can of the everlasting peaches
Hopalong set the can in the frying pan and then flitted from loophole to
loophole shooting quick and straight Several curses told him that he
had not missed and he scooped up a finger of peach juice Shots thudded
into the walls of his fort in an unceasing stream and as it grew
lighter several whizzed through the loopholes He kept close to the
earth and waited for the rush and when it came sent it back minus two
of its members

As he reloaded his Colts a bullet passed through his shirt sleeve and he
promptly nailed the marksman He looked out of a crack in the rear wall
and saw the top of an adjoining hill crowned with spectators all of
whom were armed Some time later he repulsed another attack and heard a
faint cheer from his friends on the hill Then he saw a barrel blazing
from end to end roll out from the place he had so carefully covered
with mounds It gathered speed and bounded over the rough ground
flashed between two rocks and leaped into the trench where it crackled
and roared in vain

Now said Hopalong blazing at the mounds as fast as he could fire his
rifle well just see what yu thinks of yore nice little covers

Yells of consternation and pain rang out in a swelling chorus and legs
and arms jerked and flopped one man in his astonishment at the shot
that tore open his cheek sitting up in plain sight of the marksman
Roars of rage floated up from the main body of the besiegers and the
discomfited remnant of barrelrollers broke for real cover

Then he stopped another rush from the front made upon the supposition
that he was thinking only of the second detachment A hearty cheer arose
from Tom Halloway and his friends ensconced in their rocky position
and it was taken up by those on the hill who danced and yelled their
delight at the battle to them more humorous than otherwise

This recognition of his prowess from men of the caliber of his audience
made him feel good and he grinned Gee Ill bet Halloway an his
friends is shore itchin to get in this he murmured firing at a head
that was shown for an instant Wonder what Redll say when Jimmy tells
himbet hell plow dust like a cyclone and Hopalong laughed picturing
to himself the satiation of Reds anger Old redheaded sonofagun
murmured the cowboy affectionately he shore can fight

As he squinted over the sights of his rifle his eye caught sight of a
moving body of men as they cantered over the flats about two miles away
In his eagerness he forgot to shoot and carefully counted them Nine
he grumbled Wonder whats th matter Fearing that they were not
his friends Then a second body numbering eight cantered into sight and
followed the first

Whoop Theres th Redhead he shouted dancing in his joy Now
he shouted at the peach can joyously yu wait about thirty minutes an
yull shore reckon Hades has busted loose

He grabbed up his Colts which he kept loaded for repelling rushes and
recklessly emptied them into the bushes and between the rocks and trees
searching every likely place for a human target Then he slipped his
rifle in a loophole and waited for good shots having worked off the
dangerous pressure of his exuberance

Soon he heard a yell from the direction of the Miners Rest and fell
to jamming cartridges into his revolvers so that he could sally out and
join in the fray by the side of Red

The thunder of madly pounding hoofs rolled up the trail and soon a
horse and rider shot around the corner and headed for the copse Three
more raced close behind and then a bunch of six followed by the rest
spread out and searched for trouble

Red a Colt in each hand and hatless stood up in his stirrups and
sent shot after shot into the fleeing mob which he could not follow on
account of the nature of the ground Buck wheeled and dashed down the
trail again with Red a close second the others packed in a solid mass
and after them At the first level stretch the newcomers swept down
and hit their enemies going through them like a knife through cheese
Hopalong danced up and down with rage when he could not find his horse
and had to stand and yell a spectator

The fight drifted in among the buildings where it became a series of
isolated duels and soon Hopalong saw panicstricken horses carrying
their riders out of the other side of the town Then he went gunning for
the man who had rustled his horse He was unsuccessful and returned to
his peaches

Soon the riders came up and when they saw Hopalong shove a peach into
his powdergrimed mouth they yelled their delight

Yu old maverick Eatin peaches like yu was afraid wed git some
shouted Red indignantly leaping down and running up to his pal as
though to thrash him

Hopalong grinned pleasantly and fired a peach against Reds eye I
was savin that one for yu Reddie he remarked as he avoided Bucks
playful kick Yu fellers git to work an dig up some wealthIm
hungry Then he turned to Buck Yore th marshal of this town an any
sonofagun what dont like it had better write Oh yes here comes
Tom Hallowaymember him

Buck turned and faced the miner and his hand went out with a jerk

Well Ill be locoed if I didnt punch with yu on th TinCup he
said

Yu shore did an yu was purty devilish but that there Cassidy of yourn
beats anything I ever seen

Hes a good kid replied Buck glancing to where Red and Hopalong were
quarreling as to who had eaten the most pie in a contest held some years
before

Johnny nosing around came upon the perforated and partially scattered
piles of earth and twigs and vented his disgust of them by kicking them
to pieces Hey Hoppy Oh Hoppy he called what are these things

Hopalong jammed Reds hat over that persons eyes and replied Oh
thems some loaded dice I fixed for them

Yu sonofagun sputtered Red as he wrestled with his friend in the
exuberance of his pride Yu sonofagun Yu shore ought to be ashamed
to treat em that way

Shore replied Hopalong But I aint



CHAPTER XII The Hospitality of Travennes


Mr Buck Peters rode into Alkaline one bright September morning and
sought refreshment at the Emporium Mr Peters had just finished some
business for his employer and felt the satisfaction that comes with
the knowledge of work well done He expected to remain in Alkaline
for several days where he was to be joined by two of his friends and
punchers Mr Hopalong Cassidy and Mr Red Connors both of whom were
at Cactus Springs seventy miles to the east Mr Cassidy and his friend
had just finished a nocturnal tour of Santa Fe and felt somewhat peevish
and dull in consequence not to mention the sadness occasioned by
the expenditure of the greater part of their combined capital on such
foolishness as faro roulette and wetgoods

Mr Peters and his friends had sought wealth in the Black Hills where
they had enthusiastically disfigured the earth in the fond expectation
of uncovering vast stores of virgin gold Their hopes were of an
optimistic brand and had existed until the last canister of cornmeal
flour had been emptied by Mr Cassidys burro which waited not upon
its masters pleasure nor upon the ethics of the case When Mr Cassidy
had returned from exercising the animal and himself over two miles of
rocky hillside in the vain endeavor to give it his opinion of burros and
sundry chastisements he was requested as owner of the beast to
give his counsel as to the best way of securing eighteen breakfasts
Remembering that the animal was headed north when he last saw it and
that it was too old to eat anyway he suggested a plan which had
worked successfully at other times for other ends namely poker
Mr McAllister an expert at the great American game volunteered his
service in accordance with the spirit of the occasion and half an hour
later he and Mr Cassidy drifted into Pells poker parlors which
were located in the rear of a Chinese laundry where they gathered unto
themselves the wherewithal for the required breakfasts An hour spent
in the card room of the Hurrah convinced its proprietor that they had
wasted their talents for the past six weeks in digging for gold
The proof of this permitted the departure of the outfits with their
customary elan

At Santa Fe the various individuals had gone their respective ways to
reassemble at the ranch in the near future and for several days they
had been drifting south in groups of twos and threes and like chaff
upon a stream had eddied into Alkaline where Mr Peters had found
them arduously engaged in postponing the final journey After he had
gladdened their hearts and soothed their throats by making several pithy
remarks to the bartender with whom he established their credit he
cautioned them against letting any one harm them and smiling at the
humor of his warning left abruptly

Cactus Springs was burdened with a zealous and initiative organization
known as vigilantes whose duty it was to extend the courtesies of the
land to cattle thieves and the like This organization boasted of the
name of Travennes Terrors and of a muster roll of twenty There was
also a boast that no one had ever escaped them which if true was in
many cases unfortunate Mr Slim Travennes with whom Mr Cassidy had
participated in an extemporaneous exchange of Colts courtesies in
Santa Fe the year before was the head of the organization and was also
chairman of the committee on arrivals and the two gentlemen of the
Bar20 had not been in town an hour before he knew of it

Being anxious to show the strangers every attention and having a keen
recollection of the brand of gunplay commanded by Mr Cassidy he
planned a smoother method of procedure and one calculated to permit him
to enjoy the pleasures of a good old age Mr Travennes knew that horse
thieves were regarded as social enemies that the necessary proof of
their guilt was the finding of stolen animals in their possession that
death was the penalty and that every man whether directly concerned or
not regarded himself as judge jury and executioner

He had several acquaintances who were bound to him by his knowledge of
crimes they had committed and would could not refuse his slightest wish
Even if they had been free agents they were not above causing the death
of an innocent man Mr Travennes feeling very selfsatisfied at his
cleverness arranged to have the proof placed where it would do the most
harm and intended to take care of the rest by himself

Mr Connors feeling much refreshed and very hungry arose at daylight
the next morning and dressing quickly started off to feed and water
the horses After having several tilts with the landlord about the
bucket he took his departure toward the corral at the rear Peering
through the gate he could hardly believe his eyes He climbed over it
and inspected the animals at close range and found that those which he
and his friend had ridden for the last two months were not to be
seen but in their places were two better animals which concerned him
greatly Being fair and square himself he could not understand the
change and sought enlightenment of his more imaginative and suspicious
friend

Hey Hopalong he called come out here an see what th blazes has
happened

Mr Cassidy stuck his auburn head out of the wounded shutter and
complacently surveyed his companion Then he saw the horses and looked
hard

Quit yore foolin yu old cuss he remarked pleasantly as he groped
around behind him with his feet searching for his boots Anybody would
think yu was a little boy with yore fool jokes Aint yu ever goin to
grow up

Theyve got our bronch replied Mr Connors in an injured tone
Honest I aint kiddin yu he added for the sake of peace

Who has Came from the window followed immediately by Yuve got my
boots

I ainttheyre under th bunk contradicted and explained Mr
Connors Then turning to the matter in his mind he replied I dont
know whos got them If I did do yu think Id be holdin hands with
myself

Nobodyd accuse yu of anything like that came from the window
accompanied by an overdone snicker

Mr Connors flushed under his accumulated tan as he remembered the
varied pleasures of Santa Fe and he regarded the bronchos in anything
but a pleasant state of mind

Mr Cassidy slid through the window and approached his friend looking
as serious as he could

Any tracks He inquired as he glanced quickly over the ground to see
for himself

Not after that wind we had last night They might have growed there for
all I can see growled Mr Connors

I reckon we better hold a powwow with th foreman of this shack an
find out what he knows suggested Mr Cassidy This looks too good to
be a swap

Mr Connors looked his disgust at the idea and then a light broke in
upon him Mebby they was hard pushed an wanted fresh cayuses he
said A whole lot of people get hard pushed in this country Anyhow
well prospect th boss

They found the proprietor in his stocking feet getting the breakfast
and Mr Cassidy regarded the preparations with open approval He counted
the tin plates and found only three and thinking that there would be
more plates if there were others to feed glanced into the landlords
room Not finding signs of other guests on whom to lay the blame for
the loss of his horse he began to ask questions

Much trade He inquired solicitously

Yep replied the landlord

Mr Cassidy looked at the three tins and wondered if there had ever been
any more with which to supply his trade Been out this morning he
pursued

Nope

Talks purty nigh as much as Buck thought Mr Cassidy and then said
aloud Anybody else here

Nope

Mr Cassidy lapsed into a painful and disgusted silence and his friend
tried his hand

Who owns a mosaic bronch Chinee flag on th near side Skillet brand
asked Mr Connors

Quien sabe

Gosh he can nearly keep still in two lingoes thought Mr Cassidy

Who owns a bobtailed pinto saddlegalled cast in th near eye Star
Diamond brand white stockin on th off front prop with a habit of
scratchin itself every other minute went on Mr Connors

Slim Travennes replied the proprietor flopping a flapjack Mr
Cassidy reflectively scratched the back of his hand and looked innocent
but his mind was working overtime

Whos Slim Travennes Asked Mr Connors never having heard of that
person owing to the reticence of his friend

Captain of th vigilantes

What does he look like on th general run Blandly inquired Mr
Cassidy wishing to verify his suspicions He thought of the trouble
he had with Mr Travennes up in Santa Fe and of the reputation that
gentleman possessed Then the fact that Mr Travennes was the leader
of the local vigilantes came to his assistance and he was sure that
the captain had a hand in the change All these points existed in misty
groups in his mind but the next remark of the landlord caused them to
rush together and reveal the plot

Good said the landlord flopping another flapjack and a warnin to
hoss thieves

Ahem coughed Mr Cassidy and then continued is he a tall lanky
yallerheaded sonofagun with a big nose an lots of ears

Mebby so answered the host

Urn slopping over into bad Sioux thought Mr Cassidy and then said
aloud How long has he hung around this here layout At the same time
passing a warning glance at his companion

The landlord straightened up Look here stranger if yu hankers after
his pedigree so allfired hard yu had best pump him

I told yu this here feller wasnt a man what would give away all he
knowed lied Mr Connors turning to his friend and indicating the
host He aint got time for that Anybody can see that he is a powerful
busy man An then he aint no child

Mr Cassidy thought that the landlord could tell all he knew in about
five minutes and then not break any speed records for conversation but
he looked properly awed and impressed Well yu neednt go an get mad
about it I didnt know did I

Whos gettin mad Pugnaciously asked Mr Connors After his injured
feelings had been soothed by Mr Cassidys sullen silence he again
turned to the landlord

What did this Travennes look like when yu saw him last Coaxed Mr
Connors

Th same as he does now as yu can see by lookin out of th window
Thats him down th street enlightened the host thawing to the
pleasant Mr Connors

Mr Cassidy adopted the suggestion and frowned Mr Travennes and two
companions were walking toward the corral and Mr Cassidy once again
slid out of the window his friend going by the door



CHAPTER XIII Travennes Discomfiture


When Mr Travennes looked over the corral fence he was much chagrined to
see a man and a Colt both paying strict attention to his nose

Mornin Duke said the man with the gun Lose anything

Mr Travennes looked back at his friends and saw Mr Connors sitting on
a rock holding two guns Mr Travennes right and left wings were the
targets and they pitted their frowns against Mr Connors smile

Not that I knows of replied Mr Travennes shifting his feet
uneasily

Find anything Came from Mr Cassidy as he sidled out of the gate

Nope replied the captain of the Terrors eying the Colt Are yu in
the habit of payin early mornin calls to this here corral persisted
Mr Cassidy playing with the gun

Yaas Thats my businessIm th captain of the vigilantes

Thats too bad sympathized Mr Cassidy moving forward a step

Mr Travennes looked put out and backed off What yu mean stickin me
up thisaway He asked indignantly

Yu neednt go an get mad responded Mr Cassidy Just business Yore
cayuse an another shore climbed this corral fence last night an ate up
our bronchs an I just nachurly want to know about it

Mr Travennes looked his surprise and incredulity and craned his neck to
see for himself When he saw his horse peacefully scratching itself he
swore and looked angrily up the street Mr Connors behind the shack
was hidden to the view of those on the street and when two men ran up
at a signal from Mr Travennes intending to insert themselves in the
misunderstanding they were promptly lined up with the first two by the
man on the rock

Sit down invited Mr Connors pushing a chunk of air out of the way
with his guns The last two felt a desire to talk and to argue the case
on its merits but refrained as the black holes in Mr Connors guns
hinted at eruption Every time yu opens yore mouths yu gets closer to
th Great Divide enlightened that person and they were childlike in
their belief

Mr Travennes acted as though he would like to scratch his thigh where
his Colts chafed him but postponed the event and listened to Mr
Cassidy who was asking questions

Wheres our cayuses General

Mr Travennes replied that he didnt know He was worried for he
feared that his captor didnt have a secure hold on the hammer of the
ubiquitous Colts

Wheres my cayuse Persisted Mr Cassidy

I dont know but I wants to ask yu how yu got mine replied Mr
Travennes

Yu tell me how mine got out an Ill tell yu how yourn got in
countered Mr Cassidy

Mr Connors added another to his collection before the captain replied

Out in this country people get in trouble when theyre found with other
folks cayuses Mr Travennes suggested

Mr Cassidy looked interested and replied Yu shore ought to borrow
some experience an theres lots floating around More than one man has
smoked in a powder mill an th number of them planted who looked in
th muzzle of a empty gun is scandalous If my remarks dont perculate
right smart Ill explain

Mr Travennes looked down the street again saw number five added to the
lineup and coughed up chunks of broken profanity grieving his host by
his lack of courtesy

Time announced Mr Cassidy interrupting the round I wants them
cayuses an I wants em right now Yu an me will amble off an get
em I wont bore yu with tellin yu whatll happen if yu gets skittish
Slope along an dont be scared Im with yu assured Mr Cassidy as he
looked over at Mr Connors whose ascetic soul pined for the flapjacks
of which his olfactories caught intermittent whiffs

Well Red I reckons yu has got plenty of room out here for all yu may
corral anyhow there aint a whole lot more My friend Slim an I are
shore going to have a devil of a time if we can t find them cussed
bronchs Whew them flapjacks smell like a plain trail to payday Just
think of th nice maple juice we used to get up to Cheyenne on them
frosty mornings

Get out of here an lemme alone What do yu allus want to go an make
a feller unhappy for Cant yu keep still about grub when yu knows I
aint had my mornings feed yet Asked Mr Connors much aggrieved

Well Ill be back directly an Ill have them cayuses or a scalp Yu
tend to business an watch th herd That shorthorn yearling at th
end of th linepointing to a young man who looked capable of taking
riskshe looks like he might take a chance an gamble with yu
remarked Mr Cassidy placing Mr Travennes in front of him and
pushing back his own sombrero Dont put too much maple juice on them
flapjacks Red he warned as he poked his captive in the back of the
neck as a hint to get along Fortunately Mr Connors closing remarks
are lost to history

Observing that Mr Travennes headed south on the quest Mr Cassidy
reasoned that the missing bronchos ought to be somewhere in the north
and he postponed the southern trip until such time when they would
have more leisure at their disposal Mr Travennes showed a strong
inclination to shy at this arrangement but quieted down under
persuasion and they started off toward where Mr Cassidy firmly
believed the North Pole and the cayuses to be

Yu has got quite a metropolis here pleasantly remarked Mr Cassidy
as under his direction they made for a distant corral I can see
four different types of architecture two of em on one residence he
continued as they passed a wood and adobe hut No doubt the railroad
will put a branch down here some day an then yu can hire their old cars
for yore public buildings Then when yu gets a postoffice yu will shore
make Chicago hustle some to keep her end up Lets assay that hollow for
horsehide it looks promisin

The hollow was investigated but showed nothing other than cactus and
baked alkali The corral came next and there too was emptiness For an
hour the search was unavailing but at the end of that time Mr Cassidy
began to notice signs of nervousness on the part of his guest which
grew less as they proceeded Then Mr Cassidy retraced their steps to
the place where the nervousness first developed and tried another way
and once more returned to the starting point

Yu seems to hanker for this fool exercise quoth Mr Trayennes with
much sarcasm If yu reckons Im fond of this locoed ramblin yu shore
needs enlightenment

Sometimes I do get these fits confessed Mr Cassidy an when I
do Im dead sore on objections Lets peek in that there hut he
suggested

Huh yore ideas of cayuses are mighty peculiar Why dont you look for
em up on those cactuses or behind that mesquite I wouldnt be a heap
surprised if they was roostin on th roof They are mighty knowing
animals cayuses I once saw one that could figger like a schoolmarm
remarked Mr Travennes beginning sarcastically and toning it down as he
proceeded out of respect for his companions gun

Well they might be in th shack replied Mr Cassidy Cayuses know
so much that it takes a month to unlearn them I wouldnt like to bet
they aint in that hut though

Mr Travennes snickered in a manner decidedly uncomplimentary and began
to whistle softly at first The gentleman from the Bar20 noticed that
his companion was a musician that when he came to a strong part he
increased the tones until they bid to be heard at several hundred yards
When Mr Travennes had reached a most passionate part in Juanita and
was expanding his lungs to do it justice he was rudely stopped by the
insistent pressure of his guards Colts on the most ticklish part of
his ear

I shore wish yu wouldnt strain yoreself thataway said Mr Cassidy
thinking that Mr Travennes might be endeavoring to call assistance I
went an promised my mother on her deathbed that I wouldnt let nobody
whistle out loud like that an th opery is hereby stopped Besides
somebody might hear them mournful tones an think that something is th
matter which it aint

Mr Travennes substituted heartfelt cursing all of which was heavily
accented

As they approached the hut Mr Cassidy again tickled his prisoner and
insisted that he be very quiet as his cayuse was very sensitive to
noise and it might be there Mr Cassidy still thought Mr Travennes
might have friends in the hut and wouldnt for the world disturb them
as he would present a splendid target as he approached the building



CHAPTER XIV The Tale of a Cigarette


The open door revealed three men asleep on the earthen floor two of
whom were Mexicans Mr Cassidy then for the first time felt called
upon to relieve his companion of the Colts which so sorely itched that
gentlemans thigh and then disarmed the sleeping guards

One man an a half murmured Mr Cassidy it being in his creed that
it took four Mexicans to make one Texan

In the far corner of the room were two bronchos one of which tried in
vain to kick Mr Cassidy not realizing that he was ten feet away The
noise awakened the sleepers who sat up and then sprang to their feet
their hands instinctively streaking to their thighs for the weapons
which peeked contentedly from the bosom of Mr Cassidys open shirt One
of the Mexicans made a lightninglike grab for the back of his neck for
the knife which lay along his spine and was shot in the front of his
neck for his trouble The shot spoiled his aim as the knife flashed
past Mr Cassidys arm wide by two feet and thudded into the door
frame where it hummed angrily

The only man who could do that right was th man who invented it Mr
Bowie of Texas explained Mr Cassidy to the other Mexican Then he
glanced at the broncho that was squealing in rage and fear at the shot
which sounded like a cannon in the small room and laughed

Thats my cayuse all right an he wasnt up no cactus nor roostin on
th roof neither Hes th most affectionate beast I ever saw It took
me nigh onto six months afore I could ride him without fighting him to a
standstill said Mr Cassidy to his guest Then he turned to the horse
and looked it over Come here What dyu mean acting thataway Yu
ragged end of nothin wobbling in space Yu walleyed ornery locoed
guide to Hades Yu wont be so frisky when yuve made them seventy hot
miles between here an Alkaline in five hours he promised as he made
his way toward the animal

Mr Travennes walked over to the opposite wall and took down a pouch
of tobacco which hung from a peg He did this in a manner suggesting
ownership and after he had deftly rolled a cigarette with one hand he
put the pouch in his pocket and lighting up inhaled deeply and with
much satisfaction Mr Cassidy turned around and glanced the group over
wondering if the tobacco had been left in the hut on a former call

Did yu find yore makings He asked with a note of congratulations in
his voice

Yep Want one Asked Mr Travennes

Mr Cassidy ignored the offer and turned to the guard whom he had found
asleep

Is that his tobacco He asked and the guard anxious to make
everything run smoothly told the truth and answered

Shore He left it here last night whereupon Mr Travennes swore and
Mr Cassidy smiled grimly

Then yu knows how yore cayuse got in an how mine got out said the
latter I wish yu would explain he added fondling his Colts

Mr Travennes frowned and remained silent

I can tell yu anyhow continued Mr Cassidy still smiling but his
eyes and jaw belied the smile Yu took them cayuses out because yu
wanted yourn to be found in their places Yu remembered Santa Fe an
it rankled in yu Not being man enough to notify me that yud shoot on
sight an being afraid my friends would get yu if yu plugged me on th
sly yu tried to make out that me an Red rustled yore cayuses That
meant a lynching with me an Red in th places of honor Yu never saw
Red afore but yu didnt care if he went with me Yu dont deserve fair
play but Im going to give it to yu because I dont want anybody to say
that any of th Bar20 ever murdered a man not even a skunk like yu
My friends have treated me too square for that Yu can take this gun an
yu can do one of three things with it which are walk out in th open
a hundred paces an then turn an walk toward meafter you face me yu can
set it agoing whenever yu want to the second is put it under yore hat
an Ill put mine an th others back by the cayuses Then well toss
up an th lucky man gets it to use as he wants Th third is shoot
yourself

Mr Cassidy punctuated the close of his ultimatum by handing the weapon
muzzle first and because the other might be an adept at twirling
he kept its recipient covered during the operation Then placing his
second Colts with the captured weapons he threw them through the door
being very careful not to lose the drop on his now armed prisoner

Mr Travennes looked around and wiped the sweat from his forehead and
being an observant gentleman took the proffered weapon and walked to
the east directly toward the sun which at this time was halfway to the
meridian The glare of its straight rays and those reflected from the
shining sand would in a measure bother Mr Cassidy and interfere with
the accuracy of his aim and he was always thankful for small favors

Mr Travennes was the possessor of accurate knowledge regarding the lay
of the land and the thought came to him that there was a small but deep
hole out toward the east and that it was about the required distance
away This had been dug by a man who had labored all day in the burning
sun to make an oven so that he could cook mesquite root in the manner
he had seen the Apaches cook it Mr Travennes blessed hobbies specific
and general stumbled thoughtlessly and disappeared from sight as the
surprised Mr Cassidy started forward to offer his assistance

Upon emphatic notification from the man in the hole that his help was
not needed Mr Cassidy wheeled around and in great haste covered the
distance separating him from the hut whereupon Mr Travennes swore
in selfcongratulation and regret Mr Cassidys shots barked a cactus
which leaned near Mr Travennes head and flecked several clouds of
alkali near that persons nose causing him to sneeze duck and grin

Its his own gun grumbled Mr Cassidy as a bullet passed through his
sombrero having in mind the fact that his opponent had a whole belt
full of 44s If it had been Mr Cassidys gun that had been handed over
he would have enjoyed the joke on Mr Travennes who would have had five
cartridges between himself and the promised eternity as he would have
been unable to use the 44s in Mr Cassidys 45 while the latter would
have gladly consented to the change having as he did an extra 45 Never
before had Mr Cassidy looked with reproach upon his 45 caliber Colts
and he sighed as he used it to notify Mr Travennes that arbitration
was not to be considered which that person indorsed said indorsement
passing so close to Mr Cassidys ear that he felt the breeze made by
it

Hes been practicin since I plugged him up in Santa Fe thought Mr
Cassidy as he retired around the hut to formulate a plan of campaign

Mr Travennes sang Hile hilo and other selections principally
others and wondered how Mr Cassidy could hoist him out The slack of
his belt informed him that he was in the middle of a fast and suggested
starvation as the derrick that his honorable and disgusted adversary
might employ

Mr Cassidy while figuring out his method of procedure absentmindedly
jabbed a finger in his eye and the ensuing tears floated an idea to
him He had always had great respect for ricochet shots since his friend
Skinny Thompson had proved their worth on the hides of Sioux If he
could disturb the sand and convey several grains of it to Mr Travennes
eyes the game would be much simplified While planning for the proposed
excavation a la Colts he noticed several stones lying near at hand
and a new and better scheme presented itself for his consideration
If Mr Travennes could be persuaded to get out ofwell it was worth
trying

Mr Cassidy lined up his gloomy collection and tersely ordered them to
turn their backs to him and to stay in that position the suggestion
being that if they looked around they wouldnt be able to dodge quickly
enough He then slipped bits of his lariat over their wrists and ankles
tying wrists to ankles and each man to his neighbor That finished
to his satisfaction he dragged them in the hut to save them from the
burning rays of the sun

Having performed this act of kindness he crept along the hot sand
taking advantage of every bit of cover afforded and at last he reached
a point within a hundred feet of the besieged During the trip
Mr Travennes sang to his hearts content some of the words being
improvised for the occasion and were not calculated to increase Mr
Cassidys respect for his own wisdom if he should hear them Mr Cassidy
heard however and several fragments so forcibly intruded on his peace
of mind that he determined to put on the last verse himself and to suit
himself

Suddenly Mr Travennes poked his head up and glanced at the hut He was
down again so quickly that there was no chance for a shot at him and
he believed that his enemy was still sojourning in the rear of the
building which caused him to fear that he was expected to live on
nothing as long as he could and then give himself up Just to show his
defiance he stretched himself out on his back and sang with all his
might his sombrero over his face to keep the glare of the sun out of
his eyes

He was interrupted however forgot to finish a verse as he had
intended and jumped to one side as a stone bounced off his leg Looking
up he saw another missile curve into his patch of sky and swiftly bear
down on him He avoided it by a hairs breadth and wondered what
had happened Then what Mr Travennes thought was a balloon being
unsophisticated in matters pertaining to aerial navigation swooped down
upon him and smote him on the shoulder and also bounced off

Mr Travennes hastily laid music aside and took up elocution as he
dodged another stone and wished that the mesquiteloving crank had put
on a roof In evading the projectile he let his sombrero appear on a
level with the desert and the hum of a bullet as it passed through his
headgear and into the opposite wall made him wish that there had been
constructed a cellar also

Hile hilo intruded upon his ear as Mr Cassidy got rid of the
surplus of his hearts joy Another stone the size of a mans foot
shaved Mr Travennes ear and he hugged the side of the hole nearest his
enemy

Hibernate blank yu derisively shouted the human catapult as he
released a chunk of sandstone the size of a quail Draw in yore laigs
an buck was his Godspeed to the missile

Hey yu indignantly yowled Mr Travennes from his defective storm
cellar Dont yu know any bettern to heave things thataway

Hile hilo sang Mr Cassidy as another stone soared aloft in the
direction of the complainant Then he stood erect and awaited results
with a Colts in his hand leveled at the rim of the hole A hat waved
and an excited voice bit off chunks of expostulation and asked for an
armistice Then two hands shot up and Mr Travennes sore and disgusted
and desperate popped his head up an blinked at Mr Cassidys gun

Yu was fillin th hole up remarked Mr Travennes in an accusing
tone hiding the real reason for his evacuation In a little while Id
a been th top of a pile instead of th bottom of a hole he announced
crawling out and rubbing his head

Mr Cassidy grinned and ordered his prisoner to one side while be
secured the weapon which lay in the hole Having obtained it as quickly
as possible be slid it in his open shirt and clambered out again

Yu remind me of a feller I used to know remarked Mr Travennes as he
led the way to the hut trying not to limp Only he throwed dynamite
That was th way he cleared off chaparralblowed it off He got so used
to heaving away everything he lit that he spoiled three pipes in two
days

Mr Cassidy laughed at the fiction and then became grave as he pictured
Mr Connors sitting on the rock and facing down a line of men any
one of whom was capable of his destruction if given the interval of a
second

When they arrived at the hut Mr Cassidy observed that the prisoners had
moved considerably There was a cleanly swepttrail four yards long where
they had dragged themselves and they sat in the end nearer the guns
Mr Cassidy smiled and fired close to the Mexicans ear who lost in one
frightened jump a little of what he had so laboriously gained

Yull wear out yore pants said Mr Cassidy and then added grimly
an my patience

Mr Travennes smiled and thought of the man who so ably seconded Mr
Cassidys efforts and who was probably shot by this time The outfit of
the Bar20 was so well known throughout the land that he was aware the
name of the other was Red Connors An unreasoning streak of sarcasm
swept over him and he could not resist the opportunity to get in a stab
at his captor

Mebby yore pard has wore out somebodys patience too said Mr
Travennes suggestively and with venom

His captor wheeled toward him his face white with passion and Mr
Travennes shrank back and regretted the words

I aint shootin dogs this here trip said Mr Cassidy trembling with
scorn and anger so yu can pull yourself together Ill give yu another
chance but yu wants to hope almighty hard that Red is O K If he
aint Ill blow yu so many ways at once that if yu sprouts yull make
a good acre of weeds If he is all right yud better vamoose this range
for there wont be no hole for yu to crawl into next time What friends
yu have left will have to tote yu off an plant yu he finished with
emphasis He drove the horses outside and after severing the bonds on
his prisoners lined them up

Yu he began indicating all but Mr Travennes yu amble right smart
toward Canada pointing to the north Keep agoing till yu gets far
enough away so a Colt wont find yu Here he grinned with delight as he
saw his Sharps rifle in its sheath on his saddle and drawing it
forth he put away his Colts and glanced at the trio who were already
industriously plodding northward Hey he shouted and when they
sullenly turned to see what new idea he had found he gleefully waved his
rifle at them and warned them further This is a Sharps an its good
for half a mile so dont stop none too soon

Having sent them directly away from their friends so they could not have
him potted on the way back he mounted his broncho and indicated to
Mr Travennes that he too was to ride watching that that person did
not make use of the Winchester which Mr Connors was foolish enough to
carry around on his saddle Winchesters were Mr Cassidys pet aversion
and Mr Connors most prized possession this difference of opinion
having upon many occasions caused hasty words between them Mr Connors
being better with his Winchester than Mr Cassidy was with his Sharps
had frequently proved that his choice was the wiser but Mr Cassidy
was loyal to the Sharps and refused to be convinced Now however
the Winchester became pregnant with possibilities and therefore Mr
Travennes rode a few yards to the left and in advance where the rifle
was in plain sight hanging as it did on the right of Mr Connors
saddle which Mr Travennes graced so well

The journey back to town was made in good time and when they came to
the buildings Mr Cassidy dismounted and bade his companion do likewise
there being too many corners that a fleeing rider could take advantage
of Mr Travennes felt of his bumps and did so wishing hard things
about Mr Cassidy



CHAPTER XV The Penalty


While Mr Travennes had been entertained in the manner narrated Mr
Connors had passed the time by relating stale jokes to the uproarious
laughter of his extremely bored audience who had heard the aged efforts
many times since they had first seen the light of day and most of whom
earnestly longed for a drink The landlord hearing the hilarity had
taken advantage of the opportunity offered to see a free show Not being
able to see what the occasion was for the mirth he had pulled on his
boots and made his way to the show with a flapjack in the skillets
which in his haste he had forgotten to put down He felt sure that he
would be entertained and he was not disappointed He rounded the corner
and was enthusiastically welcomed by the hungry Mr Connors whose
ubiquitous guns coaxed from the skillet its dyspeptic wad

Th saints be praised ejaculated Mr Connors as a matter of form
not having a very clear idea of just what saints were but he knew what
flapjacks were and greedily overcame the heroic resistance of the one
provided by chance and his own guns As he rolled his eyes in ecstatic
content the very man Mr Cassidy had warned him against suddenly arose
and in great haste disappeared around the corner of the corral from
which point of vantage he vented his displeasure at the treatment he had
received by wasting six shots at the mortified Mr Connors

Steady sang out that gentleman as the lineup wavered Hes
a precedent to hell for yu fellers Dont yu get ambitious none
whatever Then he wondered how long it would take the fugitive to
secure a rifle and return to release the others by drilling him at long
range

His thoughts were interrupted by the vision of a red head that climbed
into view over a rise a short distance off and he grinned his delight as
Mr Cassidy loomed up jaunty and triumphant Mr Cassidy was executing
calisthenics with a Colt in the rear of Mr Travennes neck and was
leading the horses

Mr Connors waved the skillet and his friend grinned his congratulations
at what the token signified

I see yu got some more said Mr Cassidy as he went down the lineup
from the rear and collected nineteen weapons of various makes and
conditions this number being explained by the fact that all but one of
the prisoners wore two Then he added the five that had kicked against
his ribs ever since he had left the hut and carefully threaded the end
of his lariat through the trigger guards

Looks like we stuck up a government supply mule Red he remarked
as he fastened the whole collection to his saddle Fourteen colts six
MerwinHulberts three Prescott an one puzzle he added examining
the puzzle Made in Germany it says and it shore looks like it Its
got little pins stickin out of th cylinder like you had to swat it
with a hammer or a rock or somethin to make it go off Must be damn
dangerous to most anybody around Looks more like a cactus than a
sixshootergosh its a tenshooter I allus said them Dutchmen was
bloodyminded cusses Think of bein able to shoot yoreself ten times
before th blame thing stops Then looking at the lineup for the owner
of the weapon he laughed at the woeful countenances displayed Did
they sidle in by companies or squads He asked

By twos mostly Then they paraderested an got discharged from duty
I had eleven but one got homesick or disgusted or something an
deserted It was that cussed flapjack confessed and explained Mr
Connors

What said Mr Cassidy in a loud voice Got away Well well have to
make our getaway plumb sudden or well never go

At this instant the escaped man again began his bombardment from the
corner of the corral and Mr Cassidy paused indignant at the fusillade
which tore up the dust at his feet He looked reproachfully at Mr
Connors and then circled out on the plain until he caught a glimpse of
a fleeing cowpuncher whose back rapidly grew smaller in the
fastincreasing distance

Thats yore friend Red said Mr Cassidy as he returned from his
reconnaissance Hes that shorthorn yearling Mebby hell come back
again he added hopefully Anyhow weve got to move Hell collect
reinforcements an mebby they all wont shoot like him Get up on yore
Clarinda an hold th fort for me he ordered pushing the farther
horse over to his friend Mr Connors proved that an agile man can mount
a restless horse and not lose the drop and backed off three hundred
yards deftly substituting his Winchester for the Colts Then Mr
Cassidy likewise mounted with his attention riveted elsewhere and backed
off to the side of his companion

The bombardment commenced again from the corral but this time Mr
Connors rifle slid around in his lap and exploded twice The bellicose
gentleman of the corral yelled in pain and surprise and vanished

Purty good for a Winchester said Mr Cassidy in doubtful
congratulation

Thats why I got him snapped Mr Connors in brief reply and then
he laughed Is them th vigilantes what never let a man get away He
scornfully asked backing down the street and patting his Winchester

Well Red they wasnt all there They was only twelve all told
excused Mr Cassidy An then we was two he explained as he wished
the collection of sixshooters was on Mr Connors horse so they
wouldnt bark his shin

An we still are corrected Mr Connors as they wheeled and galloped
for Alkaline

As the sun sank low on the horizon Mr Peters finished ordering
provisions at the general store the only one Alkaline boasted and
sauntered to the saloon where he had left his men He found diem a few
dollars richer as they had borrowed ten dollars from the bartender on
their reputations as poker players and had used the money to stake Mr
McAllister in a game against the local poker champion

Has Hopalong an Red showed up yet Asked Mr Peters frowning at the
delay already caused

Nope replied Johnny Nelson as he paused from tormenting Billy
Williams

At that minute the doorway was darkened and Mr Cassidy and Mr Connors
entered and called for refreshments Mr Cassidy dropped a huge bundle
of sixshooters on the floor making caustic remarks regarding their
utility

Whats th matter Inquired Mr Peters of Mr Cassidy Yu looks mad
an anxious An where in blazes did yu corral them guns

Mr Cassidy drank deep and then reported with much heat what had
occurred at Cactus Springs and added that he wanted to go back and wipe
out the town said desire being luridly endorsed by Mr Connors

Why shore said Mr Peters well all go Such doings must be
stopped instanter Then he turned to the assembled outfits and asked
for a vote which was unanimous for war

Shortly afterward eighteen angry cowpunchers rode to the east two
redhaired gentlemen well in front and urging speed It was 8 PM when
they left Alkaline and the cool of the night was so delightful that the
feeling of ease which came upon them made them lax and they lost three
hours in straying from the dim trail At eight oclock the next morning
they came in sight of their destination and separated into two squads
Mr Cassidy leading the northern division and Mr Connors the one which
circled to the south The intention was to attack from two directions
thus taking the town from front and rear

Cactus Springs lay gasping in the excessive heat and the vigilantes who
had toed Mr Connors line the day before were lounging in the shade of
the Palace saloon telling what they would do if they ever faced the
same man again Half a dozen sympathizers offered gratuitous condolence
and advice and all were positive that they knew where Mr Cassidy and
Mr Connors would go when they died

The rolling thunder of madly pounding hoofs disturbed their postmortem
and they arose in a body to flee from half their number who guns in
hands charged down upon them through clouds of sickly white smoke
Travennes Terrors were minus many weapons and they could not be
expected to give a glorious account of themselves Windows rattled and
fell in and doors and walls gave off peculiar sounds as they grew full
of holes Above the riot rattled the incessant crack of Colts and
Winchester emphasized at close intervals by the assertive roar of
buffalo guns Off to the south came another rumble of hoofs and Mr
Connors leading the second squadarrived to participate in the
payment of the debt

Smoke spurted from windows and other points of vantage and hung wavering
in the heated air The shattering of woodwork told of heavy slugs
finding their rest and the whines that grew and diminished in the air
sang the course of 45s

While the fight raged hottest Mr Nelson sprang from his horse and ran
to the Palace where he collected and piled a heap of tinder like
wood and soon the building burst out in flames which spreading swept
the town from end to end

Mr Cassidy fired slowly and seemed to be waiting for something Mr
Connors laid aside his hot Winchester and devoted his attention to his
Colts A spurt of flame and smoke leaped from the window of a dobe
hut and Mr Connors sat down firing as he went A howl from the window
informed him that he had made a hit and Mr Cassidy ran out and dragged
him to the shelter of a nearby bowlder and asked how much he was hurt

Not muchin the calf grunted Mr Connors He was a bad shotmust
have been the cuss that got away yesterday speculated the injured
man as he slowly arose to his feet Mr Cassidy dissented from force of
habit and returned to his station Mr Travennes who was sleeping
late that morning coughed and fought for air in his sleep awakened in
smoke rubbed his eyes to make sure and scorning trousers and shirt
ran clad in his red woolen undergarments to the corral where he mounted
his scared horse and rode for the desert and safety

Mr Cassidy swearing at the marksmanship of a man who fired at his head
and perforated his sombrero saw a crimson rider sweep down upon him
said rider being heralded by a blazing 44

Gosh ejaculated Mr Cassidy scarcely believing his eyes Oh its
my friend Slim going to hades he remarked to himself in audible and
relieved explanation Mr Cassidys Colts cracked a protest and then he
joined Mr Peters and the others and with them fought his way out of the
flameswept town of Cactus Springs

An hour later Mr Connors glanced behind him at the smoke silhouetted on
the horizon and pushed his way to where Mr Cassidy rode in silence Mr
Connors grinned at his friend of the red hair who responded in the same
manner

Did yu see Slim Casually inquired Mr Connors looking off to the
south

Mr Cassidy sat upright in his saddle and felt of his Colts Yes he
replied I saw him

Mr Connors thereupon galloped on in silence



CHAPTER XVI Rustlers on the Range


The affair at Cactus Springs had more effect on the life at the Bar20
than was realized by the foreman News travels rapidly and certain
men whose attributes were not of the sweetest heard of it and swore
vengeance for Slim Travennes had many friends and the result of his
passing began to show itself Outlaws have as their strongest defense
the fear which they inspire and little time was lost in making
reprisals and these caused Buck Peters to ride into Buckskin one bright
October morning and then out the other side of the town Coming to
himself with a start he looked around shamefacedly and retraced his
course He was very much troubled for as foreman of the Bar20 he
had many responsibilities and when things ceased to go aright he was
expected not only to find the cause of the evil but also the remedy
That was what he was paid seventy dollars a month for and that was what
he had been endeavoring to do As yet however he had only accomplished
what the meanest cooks assistant had done He knew the cause of his
present woes to be rustlers cattle thieves and that was all

Riding down the wide quiet street he stopped and dismounted before the
everopen door of a ramshackle onestory frame building Tossing the
reins over the flattened ears of his vicious pinto he strode into the
building and leaned easily against the bar where he drummed with his
fingers and sank into a reverie

A shining bald pate bowed over an open box turned around and
revealed a florid face set with two small twinkling blue eyes as the
proprietor wiping his hands on his trousers made his way to Bucks end
of the bar

Mornin Buck Hows things

The foreman lost in his reverie continued to stare out the door

Mornin repeated the man behind the bar Hows things

Oh ejaculated the foreman smiling purty cussed

Anything flew

Th C80 lost another herd last night

His companion swore and placed a bottle at the foremans elbow but
the latter shook his head Not this morninIll try one of them vile
cigars however

Them cigars are th very best that began the proprietor executing
the order

Oh heck exclaimed Buck with weary disgust Yu dont have to palaver
none I shore knows all that by heart

Them cigars repeated the proprietor

Yas yas them cigarsI know all about them cigars Yu gets them for
twenty dollars a thousand an hypnotizes us into payin yu a hundred
replied the foreman biting off the end of his weed Then he stared
moodily and frowned I wonder why it is He asked We punchers like
good stuff an we pays good prices with good money What do we get Why
cabbage leaves an leather for our smokin an alcohol an extract for
our drink Now up in Kansas City we goes to a sumptious layout pays
less an gets bangup stuff If yu smelled one of them K C cigars yud
shore have to ask what it was an as for the liquor why yud think
St Peter asked yu to have one with him Its shore wrong somewhere

They have more trade in K C suggested the proprietor

An help an taxes an a license an rent an brass cut glass
mahogany an French mirrors countered the foreman

They have more trade reiterated the man with the cigars

Forty men spend thirty dollars apiece with yu every month The
proprietor busied himself under the bar Yull feel better tomorrow
Anyway what do yu care yu wont lose yore job he said emerging

Buck looked at him and frowned holding back the words which formed in
anger What was the use he thought when every man judged the world in
his own way

Have yu seen any of th boys He asked smiling again

Nary a boy Who do yu reckons doin all this rustlin

Im reckonin not shoutin responded the foreman

The proprietor looked out the window and grinned Here comes one of
yourn now

The newcomer stopped his horse in a cloud of dust playfully kicked the
animal in the ribs and entered dusting the alkali from him with a huge
sombrero Then he straightened up and sniffed Whats burnin he
asked simulating alarm Then he noticed the cigar between the teeth of
his foreman and grinned Gee but yore a brave man Buck

Hullo Hopalong said the foreman Want a smoke Waving his hand
toward the box on the bar

Mr Hopalong Cassidy sidestepped and began to roll a cigarette Shore
but Ill burn my ownI know what it is

What was yu doin to my cayuse afore yu come in Asked Buck

Nothin replied the newcomer That was mine what I kicked in th
corrugations

How is it yore ridin the calico Asked the foreman I thought yu was
dead stuck on that piebald

That piebalds a goat hes beein livin off my pants lately
responded Hopalong Every time I looks th other way he ambles over and
takes a bite at me Yu just wait til this rustler business is roped
an branded an yull see me eddicate that blessed scrapheap into
eatin grass again He swiped Billys shirt th other daytook it right
off th corral wall where Billys left it to dry Then seeing Buck
raise his eyebrows he explained Shore he washed it again That makes
three times since last fall

The proprietor laughed and pushed out the everready bottle but
Hopalong shoved it aside and told the reason Ever since I was up to K
C Ive been spoiled Im drinkin water an slush

For Petes sake has any more of yu fellers been up to K C queried
the proprietor in alarm

Shore Red an Billy was up there too responded Hopalong Reds got
a few remarks to shout to yu about yore painkiller Yu better send for
some decent stuff afore he comes to town he warned

Buck swung away from the bar and looked at his dead cigar Then he
turned to Hopalong What did you find He asked

Same old story nice wide trail up to th Staked Plainthen nothin

It shore beats me soliloquized the foreman It shore beats me

Think it was Tamale Joses old gang Asked Hopalong

If it was they took th wrong trail homethat aint th way to Mexico

Hopalong tossed aside his halfsmoked cigarette Well come on home
whats th use stewin over it Itll come out all OK in th wash
Then he laughed There wont be no piebald waitin for it

Evading Bucks playful blow he led the way to the door and soon
they were a cloud of dust on the plain The proprietor despairing of
customers under the circumstances absentmindedly wiped oil on the bar
and sought his chair for a nap grumbling about the way his trade had
fallen off for there were few customers and those who did call were
heavy with loss of sleep and with anxiety and only paused long enough
to toss off their drink On the ranges there were occurrences which
tried mens souls

For several weeks cattle had been disappearing from the ranges and the
losses had long since passed the magnitude of those suffered when Tamale
Jose and his men had crossed the Rio Grande and repeatedly levied heavy
toll on the sleek herds of the Pecos Valley Tamale Jose had raided once
too often and prosperity and plenty had followed on the ranches and the
losses had been forgotten until the fall roundups clearly showed that
rustlers were again at work

Despite the ingenuity of the ranch owners and the unceasing vigilance
and night rides of the cowpunchers the losses steadily increased until
there was promised a shortage which would permit no drive to the western
terminals of the railroad that year For two weeks the banks of the Rio
Grande had been patrolled and sharpeyed men searched daily for trails
leading southward for it was not strange to think that the old raiders
were again at work notwithstanding the fact that they had paid dearly
for their former depredations

The patrols failed to discover anything out of the ordinary and the
searchers found no trails Then it was that the owners and foremen of
the four central ranches met in Cowans saloon and sat closeted together
for all of one hot afternoon

The conference resulted in riders being dispatched from all the ranches
represented and one of the couriers Mr Red Connors rode north his
destination being faraway Montana All the ranches within a radius of
a hundred miles received letters and blanks and one week later the Pecos
Valley CattleThief Elimination Association was organized and working
with Buck as Chief Ranger

One of the outcomes of Bucks appointment was a sudden and marked
immigration into the affected territory Mr Connors returned from
Montana with Mr Frenchy McAllister the foreman of the TinCup who was
accompanied by six of his best and most trusted men Mr McAllister and
party were followed by Mr Youbet Somes foreman of the TwoXTwo of
Arizona and five of his punchers and later on the same day Mr Pie
Willis accompanied by Mr Billy Jordan and his two brothers arrived
from the Panhandle The OBarO situated close to the town of Muddy
Wells increased its payroll by the addition of nine men each of whom
bore the written recommendation of the foreman of the Bar20 The C80
Double Arrow and the Three Triangle also received heavy reinforcements
and even Carter owner of the Barred Horseshoe far removed from the
zone of the depredations increased his outfits by half their regular
strength

Buck believed that if a thing was worth doing at all that it was worth
doing very well and his acquaintances were numerous and loyal The
collection of individuals that responded to the call were noteworthy
examples of gunplay and their aggregate value was at par with twice
their numbers in cavalry


Each ranch had one large ranchhouse and numerous linehouses scattered
along the boundaries These latter while intended as camps for the
outriders had been erected in the days none too remote when Apaches
Arrapahoes and even Cheyennes raided southward and they had been
constructed with the idea of defense paramount Upon more than one
occasion a solitary linerider had retreated within their adobe walls
and had successfully resisted all the cunning and ferocity of a score
of paintbedaubed warriors and when his outfit had rescued him emerged
none the worse for his ordeal

On the Bar20 Buck placed these houses in condition to withstand seige
Twin barrels of water stood in opposite corners provisions were stored
on the hanging shelves and the bunks once again reveled in untidiness
Spare rifles in pattern ranging from longrange Sharps and buffalo
guns to repeating rifles leaned against the walls and unbroken boxes
of cartridges were piled above the bunks Instead of the lonesome
outrider he placed four men to each house two of whom were to remain
at home and hold the house while their companions rode side by side on
their multimile beat

There were six of these houses and instead of returning each night to
the same linehouse the outriders kept on and made the circuit
thus keeping every one well informed and breaking the monotony These
measures were expected to cause the rustling operations to cease at
once but the effect was to shift the losses to the Double Arrow the
linehouses of which boasted only one puncher each Unreasonable economy
usually defeats its object

The Double Arrow was restricted on the north by the Staked Plain which
in itself was considered a superb defense The White Sand Hills formed
its eastern boundary and were thought to be second only to the northern
protection The only reason that could be given for the hitherto
comparative immunity from the attacks of the rustlers was that its
cattle clung to the southern confines where there were numerous springs
thus making imperative the crossing of its territory to gain the herds

It was in linehouse No 3 most remote of all that Johnny Redmond
fought his last fight and was found face down in the half ruined house
with a hole in the back of his head which proved that one man was
incapable of watching all the loop holes in four walls at once There
must have been some casualties on the other side for Johnny was reputed
to be very painstaking in his gunplay and the empty shells which lay
scattered on the floor did not stand for as many ciphers of that his
foreman was positive

He was buried the day he was found and the news of his death ran
quickly from ranch to ranch and made more than one careless puncher
arise and pace the floor in anger More men came to the Double Arrow and
its sentries were doubled The depredations continued however and
one night a week later Frank Swift reeled into the ranchhouse and fell
exhausted across the supper table Rolling hoofbeats echoed flatly
and died away on the plain but the men who pursued them returned empty
handed The wounds of the unfortunate were roughly dressed and in his
delirium he recounted the fight His companion was found literally shot
to pieces twenty paces from the door One wall was found blown in and
this episode when coupled with the use of dynamite was more than could
be tolerated

When Buck had been informed of this he called to him Hopalong Cassidy
Red Connors and Frenchy McAllister and the next day the three men rode
north and the contingents of the ranches represented in the Association
were divided into two squads one of which was to remain at home and
guard the ranches the other to sleep fully dressed and armed and never
to stray far from their ranchhouses and horses These latter would be
called upon to ride swiftly and far when the word came



CHAPTER XVII Mr Trendley Assumes Added Importance


That the rustlers were working under a well organized system was
evident That they were directed by a master of the game was ceaselessly
beaten into the consciousness of the Association by the diversity dash
and success of their raids No one save the three men whom they had
destroyed had ever seen them But like Tamale Jose they had raided
once too often

Mr Trendley more familiarly known to men as Slippery was the
possessor of a biased conscience if any at all Tall gaunt and
weatherbeaten and with coalblack eyes set deep beneath hairless
eyebrows he was sinister and forbidding Into his fortyfive years of
existence he had crowded a century of experience and unsavory rumors
about him existed in all parts of the great West From Canada to Mexico
and from Sacramento to Westport his name stood for brigandage His
operations had been conducted with such consummate cleverness that in
all the accusations there was lacking proof

Only once had he erred and then in the spirit of pure deviltry and in
the days of youthful folly and his mistake was a written note He
was even thought by some to have been concerned in the Mountain Meadow
Massacre others thought him to have been the leader of the band of
outlaws that had plundered along the Santa Fe Trail in the late 60s
In Montana and Wyoming he was held responsible for the outrages of the
band that had descended from the HoleintheWall territory and for over
a hundred miles carried murder and theft that shamed as being weak the
most assiduous efforts of zealous Cheyennes It was in this last raid
that he had made the mistake and it was in this raid that Frenchy
McAllister had lost his wife

When Frenchy had first been approached by Buck as to his going in search
of the rustlers he had asked to go alone This had been denied by the
foreman of the Bar20 because the men whom he had selected to accompany
the scout were of such caliber that their presence could not possibly
form a hindrance Besides being his most trusted friends they were
regarded by him as being the two best exponents of gunplay that the
West afforded Each was a specialist Hopalong expert beyond belief
with his Colts sixshooters was only approached by Red whose
Winchester was renowned for its accuracy The three made a perfect
combination as the rashness of the two younger men would be under the
controlling influence of a man who could retain his coolness of mind
under all circumstances

When Buck and Frenchy looked into each others eyes there sprang into
the mind of each the same nameSlippery Trendley Both had spent the
greater part of a year in fruitless search for that person the foreman
of the TinCup in vengeance for the murder of his wife the blasting of
his prospects and the loss of his herds Buck out of sympathy for his
friend and also because they had been partners in the Double Y Now that
the years had passed and the longsoughtfor opportunity was believed
to be at hand there was promised either a cessation of the outrages or
that Buck would never again see his friends

When the three mounted and came to him for final instructions Buck
forced himself to be almost repellent in order to be capable of coherent
speech Hopalong glanced sharply at him and then understood Red was all
attention and eagerness and remarked nothing but the words

Have yu ever heard of Slippery Trendley Harshly inquired the foreman

They nodded and on the faces of the younger men a glint of hatred
showed itself but Frenchy wore his poker countenance

Buck continued Th reason I asked yu was because I dont want yu to
think yore goin on no picnic I aint shore its him but Ive had
some hopeful information Besides he is th only man I knows of whos
capable of th plays that have been made Its hardly necessary for me
to tell yu to sleep with one eye open and never to get away from yore
guns Now Im goin to tell yu th hardest part yu are goin to search
th Staked Plain from one end to th other an thats what no white
mans ever done to my knowledge

Now listen to this an dont forget it Twenty miles north from Last
Stand Rock is a spring ten miles south of that bend in Hell Arroyo is
another If yu gets lost within two days from th time yu enters th
Plain put yore left hand on a cactus sometime between sunup an
noon move around until yu are over its shadow an then ride straight
aheadthats south If you goes loco beyond Last Stand Rock follow th
shadows made before noonthats th quickest way to th Pecos Yu all
knows what to do in a sandstorm so I wont bore you with that Repeat
all Ive told yu he ordered and they complied

Im tellin yu this continued the foreman indicating the two
auxiliaries because yu might get separated from Frenchy Now I
suggests that yu look around near the Devils Rocks Ive heard that
there are several water holes among them an besides they might be
turned into fair corrals Mind yu I know what Ive said sounds damned
idiotic for anybody that has had as much experience with th Staked
Plain as I have but Ive had every other place searched for miles
around Th men of all th ranches have been scoutin an th Plain is
th only place left Them rustlers has got to be found if we have to dig
to hell for them Theyve taken th pot so many times that they reckons
they owns it an weve got to at least make a bluff at drawin cards
Mebby theyre at th bottom of th Pecos here he smiled faintly but
wherever they are weve got to find them I want to holler Keno

If you finds where they hangs out come away instanter here his face
hardened and his eyes narrowed for itll take more than yu three
to deal with them th way Im ahankerin for Come right back to th
Double Arrow send me word by one of their punchers an get all the rest
you can afore I gets there Itll take me a day to get th men together
an to reach yu Im goin to use smoke signals to call th other
ranches so there wont be no time lost Carry all th water yu can pack
when yu leaves th Double Arrow an dont depend none on cactus juice
Yu better take a pack horse to carry it an yore grubyu can shoot it
if yu have to hit th trail real hard

The three riders felt of their accouterments said So long and
cantered off for the pack horse and extra ammunition Then they rode
toward the Double Arrow stopping at Cowans long enough to spend some
money and reached the Double Arrow at nightfall Early the next morning
they passed the last linehouse and with the profane wellwishes of
its occupants ringing in their ears passed onto one of Natures worst
blundersthe Staked Plain



CHAPTER XVIII The Search Begins


As the sun arose it revealed three punchers riding away from
civilization On all sides stretching to the evilappearing horizon
lay vast blotches of dirtywhite and faded yellow alkali and sand
Occasionally a dwarfed mesquite raised its prickly leaves and rustled
mournfully With the exception of the riders and an occasional Gila
monster no life was discernible Cacti of all shapes and sizes reared
aloft their forbidding spines or spread out along the sand All was
dead ghastly all was oppressive startlingly repellent in its sinister
promise all was the vastness of desolation

Hopalong knew this portion of the desert for ten miles inwardhe had
rescued straying cattle along its southern rimbut once beyond that
limit they would have to trust to chance and their own abilities There
were water holes on this skillet but nine out of ten were death traps
reeking with mineral poisons colored and alkaline The two mentioned by
Buck could not be depended on for they came and went and more than one
luckless wanderer had depended on them to allay his thirst and had died
for his trust

So the scouts rode on in silence noting the halfburied skeletons of
cattle which were strewn plentifully on all sides Nearly three per
cent of the cattle belonging to the Double Arrow yearly found death
on this tableland and the herds of that ranch numbered many thousand
heads It was this which made the Double Arrow the poorest of the
ranches and it was this which allowed insufficient sentries in its
linehouses The skeletons were not all of cattle for at rare intervals
lay the sandworn frames of men

On the morning of the second day the oppression increased with the wind
and Red heaved a sigh of restlessness The sand began to skip across the
plain in grains at first and hardly noticeable Hopalong turned in his
saddle and regarded the desert with apprehension As he looked he
saw that where grains had shifted handfuls were now moving His mount
evinced signs of uneasiness and was hard to control

A gust of wind stronger than the others pricked his face and grains
of sand rolled down his neck The leather of his saddle emitted strange
noises as if a fairy tattoo was being beaten upon it and he raised his
hand and pointed off toward the east The others looked and saw what had
appeared to be a fog rise out of the desert and intervene between them
and the sun As far as eye could reach small whirlwinds formed and broke
and one swept down and covered them with stinging sand The day became
darkened and their horses whinnied in terror and the clumps of mesquite
twisted and turned to the gusts

Each man knew what was to come upon them and they dismounted hobbled
their horses and threw them bodily to the earth wrapping a blanket
around the head of each A rustling as of paper rubbing together became
noticeable and they threw themselves flat upon the earth their heads
wrapped in their coats and buried in the necks of their mounts For
an hour they endured the tortures of hell and then when the storm had
passed raised their heads and cursed Creation Their bodies burned
as though they had been shot with fine needles and their clothes were
meshes where once was tough cloth Even their shoes were perforated and
the throat of each ached with thirst

Hopalong fumbled at the canteen resting on his hip and gargled his mouth
and throat washing down the sand which wouldnt come up His friends
did likewise and then looked around After some time had elapsed the
loss of their pack horse was noticed and they swore again Hopalong took
the lead in getting his horse ready for service and then rode around in
a circle half a mile in diameter but returned empty handed The horse
was gone and with it went their main supply of food and drink

Frenchy scowled at the shadow of a cactus and slowly rode toward the
northeast followed closely by his friends His hand reached for his
depleted canteen but refrainedwater was to be saved until the last
minute

Im goin to build a shack out here an live in it I am exploded
Hopalong in withering irony as he dug the sand out of his ears and also
from his sixshooter I just nachurally dotes on this I do

The others were too miserable to even grunt and he neatly severed the
head of a Gila monster from its scaly body as it opened it venomous jaws
in rage at this invasion of its territory Lovely place he sneered

You better save them cartridges Hoppy interposed Red as his
companion fired again feeling that he must say something

An what for blazed his friend To plug sand storms Anybody what we
find on this Godforsaken layout wont have to be shotthey will commit
suicide an think its fun Tell yu what if them rustlers hangs out on
this sand range theyre better men than I reckons they are Anybody what
hides up here shore earns all he steals Hopalong grumbled from force
of habit and because no one else would His companions understood this
and paid no attention to him which increased his disgust

What are we up here for He asked belligerently Why because them
Double Arrow idiots cant even watch a desert We have to do their work
for them an they hangs around home an gets slaughtered Yes sir
he shouted they cant even take care of themselves when theyre in
linehouses what are forts Why that time we cleaned out them an th
C80 over at Buckskin they couldnt help runnin into singin lead

Yes drawled Red whose recollection of that fight was vivid Yas
an why He asked and then replied to his own question Because yu
sat up in a barn behind them Buck played his gun on th side window
Pete an Skinny lay behind a rock to one side of Buck me an Lanky
was across th Street in front of them an Billy an Johnny was in th
arroyo on th other side Cowan laid on his stummick on th roof of his
place with a buffalo gun an the whole blamed town was agin them There
wasnt five seconds passed that lead wasnt rippin through th walls
of their shack Th Houston House wasnt made for no fort an besides
they wasnt like th gang thats punchin now Thats why

Hopalong became cheerful again for here was a chance to differ from his
friend The two loved each other the better the more they squabbled

Yas responded Hopalong with sarcasm Yas he reiterated drawling
it out Yu was in front of them an with what Why an old
whitehaired interfering Winchester thats what Me an my Sharps

Yu and yore Sharps exploded Red whose dislike for that rifle was
very pronounced Yu and yore Sharps

Me an my Sharps as I was palaverin before bein interrupted
continued Hopalong did more damage in five min

Says yu snapped Red with heat All yu an yore Sharps could do was
to cut yore initials in th back door of their shack an

Did more damage in five minutes continued Hopalong than all th
blasted Winchesters in th whole damned town Why

An then they was cut blamed poor Every time that cannon of yourn
exploded I shore thought th

Why Cowan an his buffalo did more damage Cowan was reputed to be a
very poor shot than yu an

I thought th artillery was comin into th disturbance I could see
yore red head

MY red head exclaimed Hopalong sizing up the crimson warlock of his
companion MY red head he repeated and then turned to Frenchy Hey
Frenchy whos got th reddest hair me or Red

Frenchy slowly turned in his saddle and gravely scrutinized them
Being strictly impartial and truthful he gave up the effort of
differentiating and smiled Why if the tops of yore heads were poked
through two holes in a board an I didnt know which was which Id
shore make a mistake if I tried to name em

But Red had the last word Anyhow you didnt have a Sharps in that
fightyou had a 4570 Winchester just like mine

Thereupon the discussion was directed at the judge and the forenoon
passed very pleasantly Frenchy even smiling in his misery



CHAPTER XIX Hopalongs Decision


Shortly after noon Hopalong who had ridden with his head bowed low in
meditation looked up and slapped his thigh Then he looked at Red and
grinned

Look ahere Red he began there aint no rustlers with their
headquarters on this Godforsaken sand heap an there never was They
have to have water an lots of it too an th nearest of any account
is th Pecos or some of them streams over in th Panhandle Th
Panhandle is th best place There are lots of streams an lakes over
there an theyre right in a good grass country Why an army could
hide over there an never be found unless it was hunted for blamed good
Then again its close to the railroad Up north aways is th south
branch of th Santa Fe Trail an its far enough away not to bother
anybody in th middle Panhandle Then theres Fort Worth purty near
an other trails Didnt Buck say he had all th rest of th country
searched He meant th Pecos Valley an th Davis Mountains country All
th rustlers would have to do if they were in th Panhandle would be to
cross th Canadian an th Cimarron an hit th trail for th railroad
Good fords good grass an water all th way cattle fat when they
are delivered an plenty of room Th more I thinks about it th more I
cottons to the Panhandle

Well it shore does sound good replied Red reflectively

Do yu mean th Cunningham Lake region or farther north

Just th other side of this blasted desert anywhere where theres
water responded Hopalong enthusiastically Ive been doin some hot
reckonin for th last two hours an this is th way it looks to me
they drives th cows up on this skillet for a ways then turns east an
hits th trail for home an water They can get around th ca on near
Thatchers Lake by a swing of th north I tell yu thats th only way
outn this Who could tell where they turned with th wind raisin th
deuce with the trail Didnt we follow a trail for a ways an then
what Why there wasnt none to follow We can ride north till we walk
behind ourselves an never get a peek at them I am in favor of headin
for th Sulphur Spring Creek district We can spend a couple of weeks
if we has to an prospect that whole region without havin to cut
our water down to a smell an a taste an live on jerked beef If we
investigates that country well find something else than sand storms
poisoned water holes an blisters

Aint th Panhandle full of nesters farmers Inquired Red
doubtfully

Along th Canadian an th edges yas in th middle no explained
Hopalong They hang close together on account of th warwhoops an
they like th trails purty well because of there allus bein somebody
passin

Buck ought to send some of th Panhandle boys up there suggested Red
Theres Pie Willis an th Jordansthey knows th Panhandle like yu
knows poker

Frenchy had paid no apparent attention to the conversation up to this
point but now he declared himself Yu heard what Buck said didnt
yu He asked We were told to search th Staked Plains from one end to
th other an Im goin to do it if I can hold out long enough I aint
goin to palaver with yu because what yu say cant be denied as far as
wisdom is concerned Yu may have hit it plumb center but I knows what
I was ordered to do an yu cant get me to go over there if you shouts
all night When Buck says anything she goes He wants to know where th
cards are stacked an why he cant holler Keno an Im goin to find
out if I can Yu can go to Patagonia if yu wants to but yu go alone as
far as I am concerned

Well its better if yu dont go with us replied Hopalong taking it
for granted that Red would accompany him Yu can prospect this end of
th game an well be takin care of th other Its two chances now
where we only had one afore

Yu go east an Ill hunt around as ordered responded Frenchy

East nothin replied Hopalong Yu dont get me to wallow in hot
alkali an lose time ridin in ankledeep sand when I can hit th south
trail skirt th White Sand Hills an be in Gods country again I aint
goin to wrastle with no ca on this here trip none whatever Im goin
to travel in style get to Big Spring by ridin two miles to where I
could only make one on this stove Then Ill head north along Sulpher
Spring Creek an have water an grass all th way barrin a few
stretches While you are bein fricasseed Ill be streakin through
cottonwood groves an ridin in the creek

Yull have to go alone then said Red resolutely Frenchy aint
agoin to die of lonesomeness on this desert if I knows what Im about
an I reckon I do some Me an himll follow out what Buck said hunt
around for a while an then Frenchy can go back to th ranch to tell
Buck whats up an Ill take th trail yu are ascared of an meet yu at
th east end of Cunningham Lake three days from now

Yu better come with me coaxed Hopalong not liking what his friend
had said about being afraid of the trail past the ca on and wishing to
have some one with whom to talk on his trip Im goin to have a nice
long swim tomorrow night he added trying bribery

An Im goin to try to keep from hittin my blisters responded Red
I dont want to go swimmin in no creek full of moccasinsId rather
sleep with rattlers or copperheads Every time I sees a cottonmouth I
feels like I had just sit down on one

Ill flip a coin to see whether yu comes or not proposed Hopalong

If yu wants to gamble so bad Ill flip yu to see who draws our pay
next month but not for what you said responded Red choking down the
desire to try his luck

Hopalong grinned and turned toward the south If I sees Buck afore yu
do Ill tell him yu an Frenchy are growin watermelons up near Last
Stand Rock an are waitin for rain Well so long he said

Yu tell Buck were obeyin orders shouted Red sorry that he was not
going with his bunkie

Frenchy and Red rode on in silence the latter feeling strangely
lonesome for he and the departed man had seldom been separated when
journeys like this were to be taken And when in search of pleasure they
were nearly always together Frenchy while being very friendly with
Hopalong a friendship that would have placed them side by side against
any odds was not accustomed to his company and did not notice his
absence

Red looked off toward the south for the tenth time and for the tenth
time thought that his friend might return Hes a sonofagun he
soliloquized

His companion looked up He shore is an hes right about this rustler
business too But well look around for a day or so an then yu raise
dust for th Lake Ill go back to th ranch an get things primed so
therell be no time lost when we get th word

Im sorry I went an said what I did about me takin th trail he was
ascared of confessed Red after a pause Why he aint ascared of
nothin

He got back at yu about them watermelons so whats th difference
Asked Frenchy He dont owe yu nothin

An hour later they searched the Devils Rocks but found no rustlers
Filling their canteens at a tiny spring and allowing their mounts to
drink the remainder of the water they turned toward Hell Arroyo which
they reached at nightfall Here also their search availed them nothing
and they paused in indecision Then Frenchy turned toward his companion
and advised him to ride toward the Lake in the night when it was
comparatively cool

Red considered and then decided that the advice was good He rolled a
cigarette wheeled and faced the east and spurred forward So long he
called

So long replied Frenchy who turned toward the south and departed for
the ranch

The foreman of the Bar20 was cleaning his rifle when he heard the
hoofbeats of a galloping horse and he ran around the corner of the
house to meet the newcomer whom he thought to be a courier from the
Double Arrow Frenchy dismounted and explained why he returned alone

Buck listened to the report and then noting the fire which gleamed in
his friends eyes nodded his approval to the course I reckon its
Trendley FrenchyIve heard a few things since yu left An yu can
bet that if Hopalong an Red have gone for him hell be found I expect
action any time now so well light th signal fire Then he hesitated
Yu light ityuve been waiting a long time for this

The balls of smoke which rolled upward were replied to by other balls
at different points on the plain and the Bar20 prepared to feed the
numbers of hungry punchers who would arrive within the next twentyfour
hours

Two hours had not passed when eleven men rode up from the Three
Triangle followed eight hours later by ten from the OBarO The
outfits of the Star Circle and the Barred Horseshoe eighteen in all
came next and had scarcely dismounted when those of the C80 and the
Double Arrow fretting at the delay rode up With the sixteen from
the Bar20 the force numbered seventyfive resolute and pugnacious
cowpunchers all aching to wipe out the indignities suffered



CHAPTER XX A Problem Solved


Hopalong worried his way out of the desert on a straight line thus
cutting in half the distance he had traveled when going into it He
camped that night on the sand and early the next morning took up his
journey It was noon when he began to notice familiar sights and an
hour later he passed within a mile of linehouse No 3 Double Arrow
Half an hour later he espied a cowpuncher riding like mad Thinking
that an investigation would not be out of place he rode after the rider
and overtook him when that person paused and retraced his course

Hullo Hopalong shouted the puncher and he came near enough to
recognize his pursuer Thought yu was farmin up on th Staked Plain

Hullo Pie replied Hopalong recognizing Pie Willis What was yu
chasin so hard

Coyotedamn em but cant they go some Theyre gettin so thick well
shore have to try strichnine an thin em out

I thought anybody that had been raised in th Panhandle would know
bettern to chase greased lightnin rebuked Hopalong Yu has got
about as much show catchin one of them as a tenderfoot has of bustin
an outlawed cayuse

Shore I know it responded Pie grinning But its fun seem
them hunt th horizon What are yu doin down here an where are yore
pardners

Thereupon Hopalong enlightened his inquisitive companion as to what had
occurred and as to his reasons for riding south

Pie immediately became enthusiastic and announced his intention
of accompanying Hopalong on his quest which intention struck that
gentleman as highly proper and wise Then Pie hastily turned and
played at chasing coyotes in the direction of the linehouse where he
announced that his absence would be accounted for by the fact that
he and Hopalong were going on a journey of investigation into the
Panhandle Billy Jordan who shared with Pie the accommodations of the
house objected and showed very clearly why he was eminently better
qualified to take up the proposed labors than his companions The
suggestions were fast getting tangled up with the remarks when Pie
grabbing a chunk of jerked beef leaped into his saddle and absolutely
refused to heed the calls of his former companion and return He rode to
where Hopalong was awaiting him as if he was afraid he wasnt going to
live long enough to get there Confiding to his companion that Billy
was a locoed sage hen he led the way along the base of the White Sand
Hills and asked many questions Then they turned toward the east and
galloped hard

It had been Hopalongs intention to carry out what he had told Red and
to go to Big Spring first and thence north along Sulphur Spring Creek
but to this his guide strongly dissented There was a short cut or
several of them for that matter was Pies contention and any one
of them would save a days hard riding Hopalong made no objection to
allowing his companion to lead the way over any trail he saw fit for
he knew that Pie had been born and brought up in the Panhandle the
Cunningham Lake district having been his back yard as it were So they
followed the short cut having the most water and grass and pounded out
a lively tattoo as they raced over the stretches of sand which seemed to
slide beneath them

What do yu know about this here business Inquired Pie as they raced
past a chaparral and onto the edge of a grassy plain

Nothin moren yu do only Buck said he thought Slippery Trendley is at
th bottom of it

What ejaculated Pie in surprise Him

Yore on An between yu an me an th Devil I wouldnt be a heap
surprised if Deacon Rankin is with him neither

Pie whistled Are him an th Deacon pals

Shore replied Hopalong buttoning up his vest and rolling a
cigarette Didnt they allus hang out together One watched that
th other didnt get plugged from behind It was a sort of
yuscratchmybackanIllscratchyourn arrangement

Well if they still hangs out together I know where to hunt for our
cows responded Pie Th Deacon used to range along th headwaters
of th Coloradoit aint far from Cunningham Lake Thunderation he
shouted I knows th very ground theyre onI can take yu to th very
shack Then to himself he muttered An that doodlebug Billy Jordan
thinkin he knowed more about th Panhandle than me

Hopalong showed his elation in an appropriate manner and his companion
drank deeply from the proffered flask Thereupon they treated their
mounts to liberal doses of strapoil and covered the ground with great
speed

They camped early for Hopalong was almost worn out from the exertions
of the past few days and the loss of sleep he had sustained Pie
too excited to sleep and having had unbroken rest for a long period
volunteered to keep guard and his companion eagerly consented

Early the next morning they broke camp and the evening of the same day
found them fording Sulphur Spring Creek and their quarry lay only an
hour beyond according to Pie Then they forded one of the streams which
form the headwaters of the Colorado and two hours later they dismounted
in a cottonwood grove Picketing their horses they carefully made their
way through the timber which was heavily grown with brush and after
half an hours maneuvering came within sight of the further edge

Dropping down on all fours they crawled to the last line of brush and
looked out over an extensive bottoms At their feet lay a small river
and in a clearing on the farther side was a rough camp consisting of
about a dozen leanto shacks and log cabins in the main collection and a
few scattered cabins along the edge A huge fire was blazing before
the main collection of huts and to the rear of these was an indistinct
black mass which they knew to be the corral

At a rude table before the fire more than a score of men were eating
supper and others could be heard moving about and talking at different
points in the background While the two scouts were learning the lay of
the land they saw Mr Trendley and Deacon Rankin walk out of the cabin
most distant from the fire and the latter limped Then they saw two men
lying on rude cots and they wore bandages Evidently Johnny Redmond had
scored in his fight

The odor of burning cowhide came from the corral accompanied by the
squeals of cattle and informed them that brands were being blotted out
Hopalong longed to charge down and do some blotting out of another kind
but a heavy hand was placed on his shoulder and he silently wormed his
way after Pie as that person led the way back to the horses Mounting
they picked their way out of the grove and rode over the plain at a
walk When far enough away to insure that the noise made by their horses
would not reach the ears of those in the camp they cantered toward the
ford they had taken on the way up

After emerging from the waters of the last forded stream Pie raised his
hand and pointed off toward the northwest telling his companion to
take that course to reach Cunningham Lake He himself would ride south
taking for the saving of time a yet shorter trail to the Double Arrow
from where he would ride to Buck He and the others would meet Hopalong
and Red at the split rock they had noticed on their way up

Hopalong shook hands with his guide and watched him disappear into the
night He imagined he could still catch whiffs of burning cowhide and
again the picture of the camp came to his mind Glancing again at the
point where Pie had disappeared he stuffed his sombrero under a strap
on his saddle and slowly rode toward the lake A coyote slunk past him
on a timedestroying lope and an owl hooted at the foolishness of
men He camped at the base of a cottonwood and at daylight took up his
journey after a scanty breakfast from his saddlebags

Shortly before noon he came in sight of the lake and looked for his
friend He had just ridden around a clump of cottonwoods when he was
hit on the back with something large and soft Turning in his saddle
with his Colts ready he saw Red sitting on a stump a huge grin
extending over his features He replaced the weapon said something
about fools and dismounted kicking aside the bundle of grass his friend
had thrown

Yore shore easy remarked Red tossing aside his cold cigarette
Suppose I was Trendley where would yu be now

Diggin a hole to put yu in pleasantly replied Hopalong If I didnt
know he wasnt around this part of the country I wouldnt a rode as I
did

The man on the stump laughed and rolled a fresh cigarette Lighting it
he inquired where Mr Trendley was intimating by his words that the
rustler had not been found

About thirty miles to th southeast responded the other Hes
figurin up how much dust hell have when he gets our cows on th
market Deacon Rankin is with him too

Th deuce exclaimed Red in profound astonishment

Yore right replied his companion Then he explained all the
arrangements and told of the camp

Red was for riding to the rendezvous at once but his friend thought
otherwise and proposed a swim which met with approval After enjoying
themselves in the lake they dressed and rode along the trail Hopalong
had made in coming for his companion it being the intention of
the former to learn more thoroughly the lay of the land immediately
surrounding the camp Red was pleased with this and while they rode
he narrated all that had taken place since the separation on the Plain
adding that he had found the trail left by the rustlers after they had
quitted the desert and that he had followed it for the last two hours of
his journey It was well beaten and an eighth of a mile wide

At dark they came within sight of the grove and picketed their horses at
the place used by Pie and Hopalong Then they moved forward and the same
sight greeted their eyes that had been seen the night before Keeping
well within the edge of the grove and looking carefully for sentries
they went entirely around the camp and picked out several places which
would be of strategic value later on They noticed that the cabin used
by Slippery Trendley was a hundred paces from the main collection of
huts and that the woods came to within a tenth part of that distance
of its door It was heavily built had no windows and faced the wrong
direction

Moving on they discovered the storehouse of the enemy another tempting
place It was just possible if a siege became necessary for several
of the attacking force to slip up to it and either destroy it by fire
or take it and hold it against all comers This suggested a look at the
enemys water supply which was the river A hundred paces separated it
from the nearest cabin and any rustler who could cross that zone under
the fire of the besiegers would be welcome to his drink

It was very evident that the rustlers had no thought of defense
thinking perhaps that they were immune from attack with such a well
covered trail between them and their foes Hopalong mentally accused
them of harboring suicidal inclinations and returned with his companion
to the horses They mounted and sat quietly for a while and then rode
slowly away and at dawn reached the split rock where they awaited the
arrival of their friends one sleeping while the other kept guard Then
they drew a rough map of the camp using the sand for paper and laid
out the plan of attack

As the evening of the next day came on they saw Pie followed by many
punchers ride over a rise a mile to the south and they rode out to meet
him

When the force arrived at the camp of the two scouts they were shown the
plan prepared for them Buck made a few changes in the disposition of
the men and then each member was shown where he was to go and was told
why Weapons were put in a high state of efficiency canteens were
refilled and haversacks were somewhat depleted Then the newcomers
turned in and slept while Hopalong and Red kept guard



CHAPTER XXI The Call


At three oclock the next morning a long line of men slowly filed
into the cottonwood grove being silently swallowed up by the dark
Dismounting they left their horses in the care of three of their number
and disappeared into the brush Ten minutes later forty of the force
were distributed along the edge of the grove fringing on the bank of the
river and twenty more minutes gave ample time for a detachment of twenty
to cross the stream and find concealment in the edge of the woods which
ran from the river to where the corral made an effective barrier on the
south

Eight crept down on the western side of the camp and worked their way
close to Mr Trendleys cabin door and the seven who followed this
detachment continued and took up their positions at the rear of the
corral where it was hoped some of the rustlers would endeavor to
escape into the woods by working their way through the cattle in the
corral and then scaling the stockade wall These seven were from the
Three Triangle and the Double Arrow and they were positive that any
such attempt would not be a success from the viewpoint of the rustlers

Two of those who awaited the pleasure of Mr Trendley crept forward and
a rope swished through the air and settled over the stump which lay most
convenient on the other side of the cabin door Then the slack moved
toward the woods raised from the ground as it grew taut and with
the stump for its axis swung toward the door where it rubbed gently
against the rough logs It was made of braided horsehair was half an
inch in diameter and was stretched eight inches above the ground

As it touched the door Lanky Smith Hopalong and Red stepped out of the
shelter of the woods and took up their positions behind the cabin Lanky
behind the northeast corner where he would be permitted to swing his
right arm In his gloved right hand he held the carefully arranged coils
of a fiftyfoot lariat and should the chief of the rustlers escape
tripping he would have to avoid the cast of the best roper in the
southwest

The two others took the northwest corner and one of them leaned slightly
forward and gently twitched the trippingrope The man at the other end
felt the signal and whispered to a companion who quietly disappeared in
the direction of the river and shortly afterward the mournful cry of a
whippoorwill dirged out on the early morning air It had hardly died
away when the quiet was broken by one terrific crash of rifles and the
two camp guards asleep at the fire awoke in another world

Mr Trendley sleeping unusually well for the unjust leaped from his
bed to the middle of the floor and alighted on his feet and wide
awake Fearing that a plot was being consummated to deprive him of his
leadership he grasped the Winchester which leaned at the head of his
bed and tearing open the door crashed headlong to the earth As he
touched the ground two shadows sped out from the shelter of the cabin
wall and pounced upon him Men who can rope throw and tie a wild steer
in thirty seconds flat do not waste time in trussing operations and
before a minute had elapsed he was being carried into the woods
bound and helpless Lanky sighed threw the rope over one shoulder and
departed after his friends

When Mr Trendley came to his senses he found himself bound to a tree in
the grove near the horses A man sat on a stump not far from him three
others were seated around a small fire some distance to the north and
four others one of whom carried a rope made their way into the brush
He strained at his bonds decided that the effort was useless and
watched the man on the stump who struck a match and lit a pipe The
prisoner watched the light flicker up and go out and there was left in
his mind a picture that he could never forget The face which had been
so cruelly so grotesquely revealed was that of Frenchy McAllister and
across his knees lay a heavy caliber Winchester A curse escaped from
the lips of the outlaw the man on the stump spat at a firefly and
smiled

From the south came the crack of rifles incessant and sharp The
reports rolled from one end of the clearing to the other and seemed to
sweep in waves from the center of the line to the ends Faintly in the
infrequent lulls in the firing came an occasional report from the rear
of the corral where some desperate rustler paid for his venture

Buck went along the line and spoke to the riflemen and after some time
had passed and the light had become stronger he collected the men into
groups of five and six Taking one group and watching it closely it
could be seen that there was a world of meaning in this maneuver One
man started firing at a particular window in an opposite hut and then
laid aside his empty gun and waited When the muzzle of his enemys gun
came into sight and lowered until it had nearly gained its sight level
the rifles of the remainder of the group crashed out in a volley and
usually one of the bullets at least found its intended billet This
volley firing became universal among the besiegers and the effect was
marked

Two men sprinted from the edge of the woods near Mr Trendleys cabin
and gained the shelter of the storehouse which soon broke out in
flames The burning brands fell over the main collection of huts where
there was much confusion and swearing The early hour at which the
attack had been delivered at first led the besieged to believe that
it was an Indian affair but this impression was soon corrected by the
volley firing which turned hope into despair It was no great matter
to fight Indians that they had done many times and found more or less
enjoyment in it but there was a vast difference between brave and
puncher and the chances of their salvation became very small They
surmised that it was the work of the cowmen on whom they had preyed
and that vengeful punchers lay hidden behind that deathfringe of green
willow and hazel

Red assisted by his inseparable companion Hopalong laboriously
climbed up among the branches of a black walnut and hooked one leg over
a convenient limb Then he lowered his rope and drew up the Winchester
which his accommodating friend fastened to it Settling himself in a
comfortable position and sheltering his body somewhat by the tree he
shaded his eyes by a hand and peered into the windows of the distant
cabins

How is she Red Anxiously inquired the man on the ground

Bully want to come up

Nope Im goin to catch yu when yu lets go replied Hopalong with a
grin

Which same I aint goin to responded the man in the tree

He swung his rifle out over a forked limb and let it settle in the
crotch Then he slew his head around until he gained the bead he wished
Five minutes passed before he caught sight of his man and then he fired
Jerking out the empty shell he smiled and called out to his friend
One

Hopalong grinned and went off to tell Buck to put all the men in trees

Night came on and still the firing continued Then an explosion shook
the woods The storehouse had blown up and a sky full of burning timber
fell on the cabins and soon three were half consumed their occupants
dropping as they gained the open air One hundred paces makes fine
potshooting as Deacon Rankin discovered when evacuation was the choice
necessary to avoid cremation He never moved after he touched the ground
and Red called out Two not knowing that his companion had departed

The morning of the next day found a wearied and hopeless garrison and
shortly before noon a soiled white shirt was flung from a window in the
nearest cabin Buck ran along the line and ordered the firing to cease
and caused to be raised an answering flag of truce A full minute
passed and then the door slowly opened and a leg protruded more slowly
followed by the rest of the man and Cheyenne Charley strode out to
the bank of the river and sat down His example was followed by several
others and then an unexpected event occurred Those in the cabins who
preferred to die fighting angered at this desertion opened fire on
their former comrades who barely escaped by rolling down the slightly
inclined bank into the river Red fired again and laughed to himself
Then the fugitives swam down the river and landed under the guns of the
last squad They were taken to the rear and after being bound were
placed under a guard There were seven in the party and they looked worn
out

When the huts were burning the fiercest the uproar in the corral arose
to such a pitch as to drown all other sounds There were left within its
walls a few hundred cattle whose brands had not yet been blotted out
and these maddened to frenzy by the shooting and the flames tore from
one end of the enclosure to the other crashing against the alternate
walls with a noise which could be heard far out on the plain Scores
were trampled to death on each charge and finally the uproar subsided
in sheer want of cattle left with energy enough to continue When the
corral was investigated the next day there were found the bodies of four
rustlers but recognition was impossible

Several of the defenders were housed in cabins having windows in the
rear walls which the occupants considered fortunate This opinion
was revised however after several had endeavored to escape by these
openings The first thing that occurred when a man put his head out was
the hum of a bullet and in two cases the experimenters lost all need of
escape

The volley firing had the desired effect and at dusk there remained
only one cabin from which came opposition Such a fire was concentrated
on it that before an hour had passed the door fell in and the firing
ceased There was a rush from the side and the Barred Horseshoe men
who swarmed through the cabins emerged without firing a shot The
organization that had stirred up the Pecos Valley ranches had ceased to
exist



CHAPTER XXII The Showdown


A fire burned briskly in front of Mr Trendleys cabin that night and
several punchers sat around it occupied in various ways Two men leaned
against the wall and sang softly of the joys of the trail and the range
One of them Lefty Allen of the OBarO sang in his sweet tenor and
other men gradually strolled up and seated themselves on the ground
where the fitful gleam of responsive pipes and cigarettes showed like
fireflies The songs followed one after another first a lovers plea in
soft Spanish and then a rollicking tale of the cowtowns and men Supper
had long since been enjoyed and all felt that life was indeed well
worth living

A shadow loomed against the cabin wall and a procession slowly made its
way toward the open door The leader Hopalong disappeared within and
was followed by Mr Trendley bound and hobbled and tied to Red the
rear being brought up by Frenchy whose rifle lolled easily in the
crotch of his elbow The singing went on uninterrupted and the hum of
voices between the selections remained unchanged Buck left the crowd
around the fire and went into the cabin where his voice was heard
assenting to something Hopalong emerged and took a seat at the fire
sending two punchers to take his place He was joined by Frenchy and
Red the former very quiet

In the center of a distant group were seven men who were not armed
Their belts half full of cartridges supported empty holsters They sat
and talked to the men around them swapping notes and experiences and
in several instances found former friends and acquaintances These men
were not bound and were apparently members of Bucks force Then one of
them broke down but quickly regained his nerve and proposed a game
of cards A fire was started and several games were immediately in
progress These seven men were to die at daybreak

As the night grew older man after man rolled himself in his blanket
and lay down where he sat sinking off to sleep with a swiftness that
bespoke tired muscles and weariness All through the night however
there were twelve men on guard of whom three were in the cabin

At daybreak a shot from one of the guards awakened every man within
hearing and soon they romped and scampered down to the rivers edge
to indulge in the luxury of a morning plunge After an hours horseplay
they trooped back to the cabin and soon had breakfast out of the way

Waffles foreman of the OBarO and Youbet Somes strolled over to the
seven unfortunates who had just completed a choking breakfast and nodded
a hearty Good morning Then others came up and finally all moved off
toward the river Crossing it they disappeared into the grove and all
sounds of their advance grew into silence

Mr Trendley escorted outside for the air saw the procession as it
became lost to sight in the brush He sneered and asked for a smoke
which was granted Then his guards were changed and the men began to
straggle back from the grove

Mr Trendley with his back to the cabin scowled defiantly at the crowd
that hemmed him in The coolest most damnable murderer in the West was
not now going to beg for mercy When he had taken up crime as a means
of livelihood he had decided that if the price to be paid for his course
was death he would pay like a man He glanced at the cottonwood grove
wherein were many ghastly secrets and smiled His hairless eyebrows
looked like livid scars and his lips quivered in scorn and anger

As he sneered at Buck there was a movement in the crowd before him and a
pathway opened for Frenchy who stepped forward slowly and deliberately
as if on his way to some bar for a drink There was something different
about the man who had searched the Staked Plain with Hopalong and Red
he was not the same puncher who had arrived from Montana three weeks
before There was lacking a certain air of carelessness and he chilled
his friends who looked upon him as if they had never really known him
He walked up to Mr Trendley and gazed deeply into the evil eyes

Twenty years before Frenchy McAllister had changed his identity from
a happygolucky devilmaycare cowpuncher and became a machine The
grief that had torn his soul was not of the kind which seeks its outlet
in tears and wailing it had turned and struck inward and now his
deliberate ferocity was icy and devilish Only a glint in his eyes told
of exultation and his words were sharp and incisive one could well
imagine one heard the click of his teeth as they bit off the consonants
every letter was clearcut every syllable startling in its clearness

Twenty years and two months ago today he began you arrived at the
ranchhouse of the Double Y up near the MontanaWyoming line Everything
was quiet except perhaps a womans voice singing You entered and
before you left you pinned a note to that womans dress I found it and
it is due

The air of carelessness disappeared from the members of the crowd and
the silence became oppressive Most of those present knew parts of
Frenchys story and all were in hearty accord with anything he might
do He reached within his vest and brought forth a deerskin bag Opening
it he drew out a package of oiled silk and from that he took a paper
Carefully replacing the silk and the bag he slowly unfolded the sheet
in his hand and handed it to Buck whose face hardened Two decades had
passed since the foreman of the Bar20 had seen that precious sheet but
the scene of its finding would never fade from his memory He stood as
if carved from stone with a look on his face that made the crowd shift
uneasily and glance at Trendley

Frenchy turned to the rustler and regarded him evilly You are the
hellish brute that wrote that note pointing to the paper in the hand
of his friend Then turning again he spoke Buck read that paper

The foreman cleared his throat and read distinctly


McAllister Yore wife is too blame good to live

 TRENDLEY


There was a shuffling sound but Buck and Frenchy silently backed up by
Hopalong and Red intervened and the crowd fell back where it surged
in indecision

Gentlemen said Frenchy I want you to vote on whether any man here
has more right to do with Slippery Trendley as he sees fit than myself
Any one who thinks so or that he should be treated like the others
step forward Majority rules

There was no advance and he spoke again Is there any one here who
objects to this man dying

Hopalong and Red awkwardly bumped their knuckles against their guns and
there was no response

The prisoner was bound with cowhide to the wall of the cabin and four
men sat near and facing him The noonday meal was eaten in silence and
the punchers rode off to see about rounding up the cattle that grazed
over the plain as far as eye could see Suppertime came and passed
and busy men rode away in all directions Others came and relieved the
guards and at midnight another squad took up the vigil

Day broke and the thunder of hoofs as the punchers rounded up the cattle
became very noticeable One herd swept past toward the south guarded
and guided by fifteen men Two hours later and another followed taking
a slightly different trail so as to avoid the closecropped grass left
by the first At irregular intervals during the day other herds swept
by until six had passed and denuded the plain of cattle

Buck perspiring and dusty accompanied by Hopalong and Red rode up
to where the guards smoked and joked Frenchy came out of the cabin
and smiled at his friends Swinging in his left hand was a newly filled
Colts 45 which was recognized by his friends as the one found in the
cabin and it bore a rough T gouged in the butt

Buck looked around and cleared his throat Weve got th cows on th
home trail Frenchy he suggested

Yas Inquired Frenchy Are there many

Yas replied Buck waving his hand at the guards ordering them to
follow their friends Its a good deal for us weve done right smart
this hand An its a good thing weve got so many punchers we got a
lot of cattle to drive

About five times th size of th herd that blamed near made angels
outen me an yu responded Frenchy with a smile

I hope almighty hard that we dont have no stampedes on this here
drive If th last herds go wild theyll pick up th others an then
therell be th devil to pay

Frenchy smiled again and shot a glance at where Mr Trendley was bound
to the cabin wall

Buck looked steadily southward for some time and then flecked a foamsud
from the flank of his horse We are goin south along th Creek until
we gets to Big Spring where well turn right smart to th west We
wont be able to average moren twelve miles a day though Im goin to
drive them hard Hows yore grub

Grub to burn

Got yore rope Asked the foreman of the Bar20 speaking as if the
question had no especial meaning

Frenchy smiled Yes

Hopalong absentmindedly jabbed his spurs into his mount with the result
that when the storm had subsided the spell was broken and he said So
long and rode south followed by Buck and Red As they swept out of
sight behind a grove Red turned in his saddle and waved his hat Buck
discussed with assiduity the prospects of a rainfall and was very
cheerful about the recovery of the stolen cattle Red could see a tall
broadshouldered man standing with his feet spread far apart swinging a
Colts 45 and Hopalong swore at everything under the sun Dust arose in
streaming clouds far to the south and they spurred forward to overtake
the outfits

Buck Peters riding over the starlit plain in his desire to reach the
first herd which slept somewhere to the west of him under the care
of Waffles thought of the events of the past few weeks and gradually
became lost in the memories of twenty years before which crowded up
before his mind like the notes of a halfforgotten song His nature
tempered by two decades of a harsh existence softened as he lived again
the years that had passed and as he thought of the things which had
been He was so completely lost in his reverie that he failed to hear
the muffled hoofbeats of a horse that steadily gained upon him and when
Frenchy McAllister placed a friendly hand on his shoulder he started as
if from a deep sleep

The two looked at each other and their hands met The question which
sprang into Bucks eyes found a silent answer in those of his friend
They rode on side by side through the clear night and together drifted
back to the days of the Double Y

After an hour had passed the foreman of the Bar20 turned to his
companion and then hesitated

Did didwas he a cur

Frenchy looked off toward the south and after an interval replied
Yas Then as an after thought he added Yu see he never reckoned
it would be that way

Buck nodded although he did not fully understand and the subject was
forever closed



CHAPTER XXIII Mr Cassidy Meets a Woman


The work of separating the cattle into herds of the different brands
was not a big contract and with so many men it took but a comparatively
short time and in two days all signs of the rustlers had faded It was
then that good news went the rounds and the men looked forward to a
week of pleasure which was all the sharper accentuated by the grim
mercilessness of the expedition into the Panhandle Here was a chance
for unlimited hilarity and a whole week in which to give strict
attention to celebrating the recent victory

So one day Mr Hopalong Cassidy rode rapidly over the plain thinking
about the joys and excitement promised by the carnival to be held
at Muddy Wells With that rivalry so common to Western towns the
inhabitants maintained that the carnival was to break all records this
because it was to be held in their town Perrys Bend and Buckskin had
each promoted a similar affair and if this years festivities were
to be an improvement on those which had gone before they would
most certainly be worth riding miles to see Perrys Bend had been
unfortunate m being the first to hold a carnival inasmuch as it only
set a mark to be improved upon and Buckskin had taken advantage of this
and had added a brass band and now in turn was to be eclipsed

The events slated were numerous and varied the most important being
those which dealt directly with the everyday occupations of the
inhabitants of that section of the country Broncho busting
steerroping and tying rifle and revolver shooting trick riding and
fancy roping made up the main features of the programme and were to
be set off by horse and foot racing and other county fair necessities
Altogether the proud citizens of the town looked forward with keen
anticipation to the coming excitements and were prone to swagger a
bit and to rub their hands in condescending egoism while the crowded
gambling halls and saloons and the threecardmonte men on the street
corners enriched themselves at the cost of venturesome knowitails

Hopalong was firmly convinced that his day of hard riding was well worth
while for the Bar20 was to be represented in strength Probably
a clearer insight into his idea of a carnival can be gained by his
definition grouchily expressed to Red Connors on the day following the
last affair Raise cain go broke wake up an begin punching cows
all over again But that was the day after and the day after is always
filled with remorse

Hopalong and Red having twice in succession won the revolver and rifle
competitions respectively hoped to make it Three straight Lanky
Smith the Bar20 rope expert had taken first prize in the only contest
he had entered Skinny Thompson had lost and drawn with Lefty Allen of
the OBarO in the bronchobusting event but as Skinny had improved
greatly in the interval his friends confidently expected him to yank
first place for the honor of his ranch These expectations were backed
with all the available Bar20 money and if they were not realized
something in the nature of a calamity would swoop down upon and wrap
that ranch in gloom Since the OBarO was aggressively optimistic the
betting was at even money hats and guns and the losers would begin
life anew so far as earthly possessions were concerned No other
competitors were considered in this event as Skinny and Lefty had so
far outclassed all others that the honor was believed to lie between
these two

Hopalong blissfully figuring out the chances of the different
contestants galloped around a clump of mesquite only fifteen miles from
Muddy Wells and stiffened in his saddle for twenty rods ahead of him on
the trail was a woman As she heard him approach she turned and waited
for him to overtake her and when she smiled he raised his sombrero and
bowed

Will you please tell me where I am She asked

Yu are fifteen miles southeast of Muddy Wells he replied

But which is southeast

Right behind yu he answered Th town lies right ahead

Are you going there She asked

Yes maam

Then you will not care if I ride with you She asked I am a trifle
frightened

Why Id be some pleased if yu do though there aint nothing out here
to be afraid of now

I had no intention of getting lost she assured him but I dismounted
to pick flowers and cactus leaves and after a while I had no conception
of where I was

How is it yu are out here He asked Yu shouldnt get so far from
town

Why papa is an invalid and doesnt like to leave his room and the
town is so dull although the carnival is waking it up somewhat Having
nothing to do I procured a horse and determined to explore the country
Why this is like Stanley and Livingstone isnt it You rescued the
explorer And she laughed heartily He wondered who in thunder Stanley
and Livingstone were but said nothing

I like the West it is so big and free she continued But it is very
monotonous at times especially when compared with New York Papa
swears dreadfully at the hotel and declares that the food will drive him
insane but I notice that he eats much more heartily than he did when
in the city And the serviceit is awful But when one leaves the town
behind it is splendid and I can appreciate it because I had such a hard
season in the city last winterso many balls parties and theaters that
I simply wore myself out

I never hankered much for them things Hopalong replied An I dont
like th towns much either Once or twice a year I gets as far as
Kansas City but I soon tires of it an hits th back trail Yu see I
dont like a fence countryI wants lots of room an air

She regarded him intently I know that you will think me very forward

He smiled and slowly replied I think yu are all O K

There do not appear to be many women in this country she suggested

No there aint many he replied thinking of the kind to be found
in all of the cowtowns They dont seem to hanker for this kind of
lifethey wants parties an lots of dancin an them kind of things I
reckon there aint a whole lot to tempt em to come

You evidently regard women as being very frivolous she replied

Well Im speakin from there not being any out here he responded
although I dont know much about them to tell th truth Them what are
out here cant be counted Then he flushed and looked away

She ignored the remark and placed her hand to her hair

Goodness My hair must look terrible

He turned and looked Yore hair is prettyI allus did like brown hair

She laughed and put back the straggling locks It is terrible Just
look at it Isnt it awful

Why no I reckons not he replied critically It looks sort of free
an easy thataway

Well its no matter it cannot be helped she laughed Lets race
she cried and was off like a shot

He humored her until he saw that her mount was getting unmanageable
when he quietly overtook her and closed her ponys nostrils with his
hand the operation having a most gratifying effect

Joe hadnt oughter let yu had this cayuse he said

Why how do you know of whom I procured it She asked By th brand
its a OBarO canceled with J H over it He buys all of his cayuses
from th OBarO

She found out his name and after an interval of silence she turned to
him with eyes full of inquiry What is that thorny shrub just ahead
She asked

Thats mesquite he replied eagerly

Tell me all about it she commanded

Why there aint much to tell he replied only its a valuable tree
out here Th Apaches use it a whole lot of ways They get honey from
th blossoms an glue an gum an they use th bark for tannin hide
Th dried pods an leaves are used to feed their cattle an th wood
makes corrals to keep em in They use th wood for making other things
too an it is of two colors Th sap makes a dye what wont wash out
an th beans make a bread what wont sour or get hard Then it makes a
barrier that shore is a dandycoyotes an men cant get through it an
it protects a whole lot of birds an things Th snakes hate it like
poison for th thorns get under their scales an whoops things up for
em It keeps th sand from shiftin too Down South where there is
plenty of water it often grows forty feet high but up here it squats
close to th ground so it can save th moisture In th night th
temperature sometimes falls thirty degrees an that helps it too

How can it live without water She asked

It gets all th water it wants he replied smiling Th tap roots
go straight down til they find it sometimes fifty feet Thats why it
dont shrivel up in th sun Then there are a lot of little roots right
under it an they protects th tap roots Th shade it gives is th
coolest out here for th leaves turn with th wind an lets th breeze
throughtheyre hung on little stems

How splendid she exclaimed Oh Look there she cried pointing
ahead of them A chaparral cock strutted from its decapitated enemy a
rattlesnake and disappeared in the chaparral

Hopalong laughed Mr Scissorsbill Roadrunner has great fun with
snakes He runs along th sandan he can run tooan sees a snake
takin a siesta Snip goes his bill an th snake slides over th
Divide Our fighting friend may stop some coyotes appetite before
morning though unless he stays where he is

Just then a gray wolf blundered in sight a few rods ahead of them and
Hopalong fired instantly His companion shrunk from him and looked at
him reproachfully

Why did you do that she demanded

Why because they costs us big money every year he replied Theres
a bounty on them because they pull down calves an sometimes full grown
cows Im shore wonderin why he got so closetheyre usually just out
of range where they stays

Promise me that you will shoot no more while I am with you

Why shore I didnt think yud care he replied Yu are like that
skypilot over to Las Cruceshe preached agin killin things which is
all right for him who didnt have no cows

Do you go to the missions She asked

He replied that he did sometimes but forgot to add that it was usually
for the purpose of hilarity for he regarded skypilots with humorous
toleration

Tell me all about yourselfwhat you do for enjoyment and all about your
work she requested

He explained in minute detail the art of punching cows and told her
more of the West in half an hour than she could have learned from a
years experience She showed such keen interest in his words that it
was a pleasure to talk to her and he monopolized the conversation until
the town intruded its sprawling collection of unpainted shacks and adobe
huts in their field of vision



CHAPTER XXIV The Strategy of Mr Peters


Hopalong and his companion rode into Muddy Wells at noon and Red
Connors who leaned with Buck Peters against the side of Tom Lees
saloon gasped his astonishment Buck looked twice to be sure and then
muttered incredulously What th heck Red repeated the phrase and
retreated within the saloon while Buck stood his ground having
had much experience with women inasmuch as he had narrowly escaped
marrying He thought that he might as well get all the information
possible and waited for an introduction It was in vain however for
the two rode past without noticing him

Buck watched them turn the corner and then called for Red to come out
but that person fearing an ordeal made no reply and the foreman went
in after him The timorous one was corraling bracers at the bar and
nearly swallowed down the wrong channel when Buck placed a heavy hand on
his broad shoulder

Gway remarked Red I dont want no introduction none whatever he
asserted Gway he repeated backing off suspiciously

Better wait til yu are asked suggested Buck Better wait til yu
sees th rope afore yu duck Then he laughed Yu bashful fellers make
me plumb disgusted Why Ive seen yu face a bunch of guns an never turn
a hair an here yore all in because yu fear yull have to stand
around an hide yore hands She wont bite yu Anyway from what I saw
Hopalong is due to be her grubhe never saw me at all th chump

He shore didnt see me none replied Red with distinct relief Are

Shore answered Buck An if they wasnt they wouldnt see us not
if we stood in front of them an yelled Shes a hummerstands two hands
under him an is a whole lot prettier than that picture Cowan has got
over his bar Theres nothing th matter with his eyesight but hes
plumb locoed all th same Hell go an get stuck on her an then
shell hit th trail for home an mamma an he wont be worth his feed
for a year Then he paused in consternation Thunder Red hes got to

Well suppose he has Responded Red I dont reckon shell stampede

Yu dont reckon eh Queried Buck with much irony No an thats
whats th matter with yu Why do yu expect to see him tomorrow Yu
wont if I knows him an I reckon I do Nope hell be follerin her all
around

Hes got sand to burn remarked Red in awe Wonder how he got to know
her

Yu can gamble she did th introducing parthe aint got th nerve to
do it himself He saved her life or she thinks he did or some romantic
nonsense like that So yu better go around an get him away an keep
him away too

Who me Inquired Red in indignation Me go around an tote him off
I aint no wagon yu go or send Johnny

Johnny would say something real pert an get knocked into th middle
of next week for it He wont do so I reckon yu better go yoreself
responded Buck smiling broadly and moving off

Hey yu Wait a minute cried Red in consternation Buck paused and
Red groped for an excuse Why dont you send Billy He blurted in
desperation

The foremans smile assumed alarming proportions and he slapped his
thigh in joy Good boy he laughed Billys th mangood Lord but
wont he give Cupid cold feet Rustle around an send th pessimistic
soul to me

Red grinning and happy rapidly visited door after door shouted Hey
Billy and proceeded to the next one He was getting pugnacious at
his lack of success when he espied Mr Billy Williams tacking along the
accidental street as if he owned it Mr Williams was executing fancy
steps and was trying to sing many songs at once

Red stopped and grabbed his bibulous friend as that person veered to
starboard Yore a peach of a lifepreserver yu are he exclaimed

Billy balanced himself swayed back and forth and frowned his
displeasure at this unwarranted action I aint no wifedeserter he
shouted Unrope me an give me th trail No tenderfoot can ride me
Then he recognized his friend and grinned joyously Shore I will but
only one Jus one more jus one more Yu see mfriend it was all
Jimmys fault He

Red secured a chancery hold and dragged his wailing and remonstrating
friend to Buck who frowned with displeasure

This yere said Red in belligerent disgust is th dodblasted hero
whats agoin to save Hopalong from a mournful future What are we
agoin to do

Buck slipped the Colts from Billys holster and yanked the erring one
to his feet Fill him full of sweet oil source him in th trough walk
him around for awhile an see what it does he ordered

Two hours later Billy walked up to his foreman and weakly asked what was
wanted He looked as though he had just been released from a sixmonths
stay in a hospital

Yu go over to th hotel an find Hopalong said the foreman sternly
Stay with him all th time for there is a plot on foot to wing him on
th sly If yu aint mighty spry hell be dead by night

Having delivered the above instructions and prevarications Buck
throttled the laugh which threatened to injure him and scowled at Red
who again fled into the saloon for fear of spoiling it all with revealed
mirth

The convalescent stared in openmouthed astonishment

Whats he doin in th hotel an whos goin to plug him He asked

Yu leave that to me replied Buck All yu has to do is to get on th
job with yore gun handing the weapon to him an freeze to him like
a flea on a cow Mebby therell be a woman in th game but that aint
none of yore funeralyu do what I said

Blast th women exploded Billy moving off When he had entered the
hotel Buck went in to Red

For Petes sake moaned that person in senseless reiteration Th
Lord help Billy Holy Mackinaw he shouted Gimme a drink an let me
tell th boys

The members of the outfit were told of the plot and they gave their
uproarious sanction all needing bracers to sustain them

Billy found the clerk swapping lies with the bartender and procuring
the desired information climbed the stairs and hunted for room No 6
Discovering it he dispensed with formality pushed open the door and
entered

He found his friend engaged in conversation with a pretty young
woman and on a couch at the far side of the room lay an elderly
whitewhiskered gentleman who was reading a magazine Billy felt like a
criminal for a few seconds and then there came to him the thought that
his was a mission of great import and he braced himself to face any
ordeal Anyway he thought th prettier they are th more dust they
can raise

What are yu doing here Cried Hopalong in amazement

Thats all right averred the protector confidentially

Whats all right

Why everything replied Billy feeling uncomfortable

The elderly man hastily sat up and dropped his magazine when he saw
the armed intruder his eyes as wide open as his mouth He felt for
his spectacles but did not need them for he could see nothing but the
Colts which Billy jabbed at him

None of that snapped Billy ands up he ordered and the hands went
up so quick that when they stopped the jerk shook the room Peering over
the gentlemans leg Billy saw the spectacles and backed to the wall
as he apologized Its shore on me StrangerI reckoned yu was
contemplatin some gunplay

Hopalong blazing with wrath arose and shoved Billy toward the hail
when Mr Johnny Nelson oozing fight and importance intruded his person
into the zone of action

Lord ejaculated the newcomer staring at the vision of female
loveliness which so suddenly greeted him Mamma he added under his
breath Then he tore off his sombrero Come out of this Billy yu
chump he exploded backing toward the door being followed by the
protector

Hopalong slammed the door and turned to his hostess apologizing for the
disturbance

Who are they Palpitated Miss Deane

What the deuce are they doing up here blazed her father Hopalong
disclaimed any knowledge of them and just then Billy opened the door and
looked in

There he is again cried Miss Deane and her father gasped Hopalong
ran out into the hall and narrowly missed kicking Billy into Kingdom
Come as that person slid down the stairs surprised and indignant

Mr Billy Williams who sat at the top of the stairs was feeling hungry
and thirsty when he saw his friend Mr Pete Wilson the slow witted
approaching

Hey Pete he called come up here an watch this door while I
rustles some grub Keep yore eyes open he cautioned

As Pete began to feel restless the door opened and a dignified gentleman
with white whiskers came out into the hall and then retreated with great
haste and no dignity Pete got the drop on the door and waited Hopalong
yanked it open and kissed the muzzle of the weapon before he could stop
and Pete grinned

Coming to th fight He loudly asked Its going to be a shore nough
sumptious scrapjust th kind yu allus like Come on th boys are
waitin for yu

Keep quiet hissed Hopalong

What for Asked Pete in surprise Didnt yu say yu shore wanted to
see that scrap

Shut yore face an get scarce or yull go home in cans

As Hopalong seated himself once more Red strolled up to the door and
knocked Hopalong ripped it open and Red looking as fierce and worried
as he could asked Hopalong if he was all right Upon being assured by
smoking adjectives that he was the caller looked relieved and turned
thoughtfully away

Hey yu Come here called Hopalong

Red waved his hand and said that he had to meet a man and clattered
down the stairs Hopalong thought that he also had to meet a man and
excusing himself hastened after his friend and overtook him in the
Street where he forced a confession Returning to his hostess he told
her of the whole outrage and she was angry at first but seeing the
humorous side of it she became convulsed with laughter Her father
reread his paragraph for the thirteenth time and then slamming the
magazine on the floor asked how many times he was expected to read ten
lines before he knew what was in them and went down to the bar

Miss Deane regarded her companion with laughing eyes and then became
suddenly sober as he came toward her

Go to your foreman and tell him that you will shoot tomorrow for I
will see that you do and I will bring luck to the Bar20 Be sure to
call for me at one oclock I will be ready

He hesitated bowed and slowly departed making his way to Tom Lees
where his entrance hushed the hilarity which had reigned Striding
to where Buck stood he placed his hands on his hips and searched the
foremans eyes

Buck smiled Yu aint mad are yu He asked

Hopalong relaxed No but blame near it

Red and the others grabbed him from the rear and when he had been
buffaloed into good humor he threw them from him laughed and waved
his hand toward the bar

Come up yu sonsofguns Yore a cussed nuisance sometimes but yore a
bully gang all th same



CHAPTER XXV Mr Ewalt Draws Cards


Tex Ewalt cowpuncher prospector sometimes a rustler but always a
dude rode from El Paso in deep disgust at his steady losses at faro
and monte The pecuniary side of these caused him no worry for he was
flush This pleasing opulence was due to his business ability for
he had recently sold a claim for several thousand dollars The first
operation was simple being known in Western phraseology as jumping
and the second somewhat more complicated was known as salting

The first of the money spent went for a complete new outfit and he had
parted with just three hundred and seventy dollars to feed his vanity
He desired something contrasty and he procured it His sombrero of gray
felt a quarter of an inch thick flaunted a band of black leather on
which was conspicuously displayed a solid silver buckle His neck was
protected by a crimson kerchief of the finest heaviest silk His shirt
in pattern the same as those commonly worn in the cow country was of
buckskin soft as a babys cheek and impervious to water and the Angora
goatskin chaps with the long silken hair worn outside were as white
as snow Around his waist ran loosely a broad black leather belt
supporting a heavy black holster in which lay its walnuthandled
burden a 44 caliber sixshooter and thirty centerfire cartridges
peeked from their loops fifteen on a side His boots the soles thin
and narrow and the heels high were black and of the finest leather
Huge spurs having twoinch rowels were held in place by buckskin
straps on which also were silver buckles Protecting his hands were
heavy buckskin gloves also waterproof having wide black gauntlets

Each dainty hock of his dainty eighthundredpound buckskin pony was
black and a black star graced its forehead Well groomed with
flowing mane and tail and with the brand on its flank being almost
imperceptible the animal was far different in appearance from most of
the cowponies Vicious and highspirited it cavorted just enough to
show its lines to the best advantage


The saddle a famous Cheyenne and forty pounds in weight was black
richly embossed and decorated with bits of beaten silver which flashed
back the sunlight At the pommel hung a thirtyfoot coil of braided
horsehair rope and at the rear was a Sharps 50caliber breechloading
rifle its owner having small use for any other make The color of the
bridle was the same as the saddle and it supported a heavy U bit which
was capable of a leverage sufficient to break the animals jaw

Tex was proud of his outfit but his face wore a frownnot there only on
acount of his losses but also by reason of his mission for under all
his finery beat a heart as black as any in the cow country For months
he had smothered hot hatred and he was now on his way to ease himself of
it

He and Slim Travennes had once exchanged shots with Hopalong in Santa
Fe and the month which he had spent in bed was not pleasing and from
that encounter had sprung the hatred That he had been in the wrong made
no difference with him Some months later he had learned of the death
of Slim and it was due to the same man That Slim had again been in
the wrong also made no difference for he realized the fact and nothing
else

Lately he had been told of the death of Slippery Trendley and Deacon
Rankin and he accepted their passing as a personal affront That they
had been caught redhanded in cattle stealing of huge proportions and
received only what was customary under the conditions formed no excuse
in his mind for their passing He was now on his way to attend the
carnival at Muddy Wells knowing that his enemy would be sure to be
there

While passing through Las Cruces he met Porous Johnson and Silent Somes
who were thirsty and who proclaimed that fact whereupon he relieved
them of their torment and looking forward to more treatment of a
similar nature they gladly accompanied him without asking why or where

As they left the town in their rear Tex turned in his saddle and
surveyed them with a cynical smile

Have yu heard anything of Trendley He asked

They shook their heads

Him an th Deacon was killed over in th Panhandle he said

What chorused the pair

Jack Dorman Shorty Danvers Charley Teale Stiffhat Bailey Billy
Jackson Terry Nolan an Sailor Carson was lynched

What they shouted

Fish OBrien Pinochle Schmidt Tom Wilkins Apache Gordon Charley of
th Bar Y Penobscot Hughes an about twenty others died fightin

Porous looked his astonishment Cavalry

An Im going after th dogs who did it he continued ignoring the
question Are yu with meYu used to pal with some of them didnt
yu

We did an were shore with yu cried Porous

Yore right endorsed Silent But who done it

That gang whats punchin for th Bar20Hopalong Cassidy is th one
Im pining for Yu fellers can take care of Peters an Connors

The two stiffened and exchanged glances of uncertainty and apprehension
The outfit of the Bar20 was too well known to cause exuberant joy to
spring from the idea of war with it and well in the center of all the
tales concerning it were the persons Tex had named To deliberately
set forth with the avowed intention of planting these was not at all
calculated to induce sweet dreams

Tex sneered his contempt

Yore shore uneasy yu aint ascared are yu He drawled Porous
relaxed and made a show of subduing his horse I reckon I aint scared
plumb to death Yu can deal me a hand he asserted

Ill draw cards too hastily announced Silent buttoning his vest
Tell us about that jamboree over in th Panhandle

Tex repeated the story as he had heard it from a bibulous member of the
Barred Horseshoe and then added a little of torture as a sauce to whet
their appetites for revenge

How did Trendley cash in Asked Porous

Nobody knows except that bum from th TinCup Ill get him later Id
a got Cassidy up in Santa Fe too if it wasnt for th sun in my eyes
Me an Slim loosened up on him in th Plaza but we couldnt see nothing
with him astandin against th sun

Wheres Slim now Asked Porous I aint seen him for some time

Slims with Trendley replied Tex Cassidy handed him over to St
Pete at Cactus Springs Him an Connors sicked their outfit on him an
his vigilantes bein helped some by th OBarO They wiped th town
plumb off th earth an now Im going to do some wipin of my own
account Ill prune that gang of some of its blossoms afore long Its
cost me seventeen friends so far an Im going to stop th leak or
make another

They entered Muddy Wells at sunrise on the day of the carnival and
eating a hearty breakfast sallied forth to do their share toward making
the festivities a success

The first step considered necessary for the acquirement of case and
polish was begun at the nearest bar and Tex being the host was so
liberal that his friends had reached a most auspicious state when they
followed him to Tom Lees

Tex was too wise to lose his head through drink and had taken only
enough to make him careless of consequences Porous was determined to
sing Annie Laurie although he hung on the last word of the first
line until out of breath and then began anew Silent not wishing to be
outdone bawled at the top of his lungs a medley of musichall words to
the air of a hymn

Tex walking as awkwardly as any cowpuncher approached Tom Lees his
two friends trailing erratically arm in arm in his rear Swinging his
arm he struck the door a resounding blow and entered hand on gun as it
crashed back Porous and Silent stood in the doorway and quarreled as
to what each should drink and compromising lurched in and seated
themselves on a table and resumed their vocal perpetrations

Tex swaggered over to the bar and tossed a quarter upon it Corn
juice he laconically exclaimed Tossing off the liquor and glancing
at his howling friends he shrugged his shoulders and strode out by the
rear door slamming it after him Porous and Silent recounting friends
who had cashed in fell to weeping and they were thus occupied when
Hopalong and Buck entered closely followed by the rest of the outfit

Buck walked to the bar and was followed by Hopalong who declined his
foremans offer to treat Tom Lee set a bottle at Bucks elbow and
placed his hands against the bar

Friend of yourn just hit the back trail he remarked to Hopalong He
was primed some for trouble too he added

Yaas Drawled Hopalong with little interest

The proprietor restacked the few glasses and wiped off the bar Thems
his pardners he said indicating the pair on the table

Hopalong turned his head and gravely scrutinized them Porous was
bemoaning the death of Slim Travennes and Hopalong frowned

Dont reckon hes no relation of mine he grunted

Well he aint yore sister replied Tom Lee grinning

Whats his brand Asked the puncher

I reckon hes a maverick though yu put yore brand on him up to Santa
Fe a couple of years back Since hes throwed back on yore range I
reckon hes yourn if yu wants him

I reckon Tex is some sore remarked Hopalong rolling a cigarette

I reckon he is replied the proprietor tossing Bucks quarter in the
cash box But say you should oughter see his rig

Yaas

Hes shore a cowpunch dudemy but hes some sumptious an
highfalutin An bad Why he reckons th Lord never brewed a more
hightoned brand of cussedness than hisn He shore reckons hes the
baddest man that ever simmered

Howd he look as th leadin man in a necktie festival Blazed Johnny
from across the room feeling called upon to help the conversation

Hed be a howlin success son replied Skinny Thompson judgin by
his friends what we elevated over in th Panhandle

Lanky Smith leaned forward with his elbow on the table resting his chin
in the palm of his hand Is Ewalt still alayin for yu Hopalong He
asked

Hopalong turned wearily and tossed his halfconsumed cigarette into the
box of sand which did duty as a cuspidore I reckon so an he shore
can hatch whenever he gets good an ready too

Hes probably abroodin over past grievances offered Johnny as
he suddenly pushed Lankys elbow from the table nearly causing a
catastrophe

Yull be broodin over present grievances if yu dont look out yu
everlastin nuisance yu growled Lanky planting his elbow in its
former position with an emphasis which conveyed a warning

These bantams ruflle my feathers remarked Red They go around
braggin about th egg theyre goin to lay an do enough cacklin
to furnish music for a dozen Then when th affair comes off yull
generally find theys been settin on a doorknob

Did yu ever see a hen leave th walks of peace an bugs an rustle
hellbent across th trail plumb in front of a cayuse Asked Buck
Theyll leave off rustlin grub an become candidates for th graveyard
just for cussedness Well a whole lot of men are th same way How many
times have I seen them swagger into a gin shop an try to run things
sudden an hard an that with half a dozen better men in th same room
Theres shore aplenty of trouble acomin to every man without rustlin
around for more

Member that time yu an Frenchy tried to run th little town of Frozen
Nose up in Montana Asked Johnny winking at the rest

An we did run it for a while responded Buck But that only goes to
show that most young men are chumpswe were just about yore age then

Red laughed at the youngsters discomfiture That little squib of yourn
shore touched her offI reckon we irrigates on yu this time dont we

Th more th Kid talks th more money he needs remarked Lanky
placing his glass on the bar He had to blow me an Skinny twice last
night

I got two more after yu left added Skinny He shore oughter practice
keeping still

At one oclock sharp Hopalong walked up to the clerk of the hotel and
grinned The clerk looked up

 Hullo Cassidy He exclaimed genially What was all that fuss
about this mornin when I was away I havent seen you for a long time
have I How are you

That fuss was a fool joke of Bucks an I wish they had been throwed
out Hopalong replied What I want to know is if Miss Deane is in her
room Yu see I have a date with her

The clerk grinned

So shes roped you too has she

What do yu mean Asked Hopalong in surprise Well well laughed the
clerk You punchers are easy Any thirdrate actress that looks good to
eat can rope you fellows all right Now look here Laura you keep shy
of her corral or youll be broke so quick you wont believe you ever
had a cent thats straight This is the third year that shes been here
and I know what Im talking about How did you come to meet her

Hopalong explained the meeting and his friend laughed again

Why she knows this country like a book She cant get lost anywhere
around here But shes blame clever at catching punchers

Well I reckon Id better take her go broke or not replied Hopalong
Is she in her room

She is but she is not alone responded the clerk There is a
dude puncher up there with her and she left word here that she was
indisposed which means that you are outlawed

Who is he Asked Hopalong having his suspicions That friend of
yours Ewalt He sported a wad this morning when she passed him and she
let him make her acquaintance Hes another easy mark Hell be busted
wide open tonight

I reckon Ill see Tex suggested Hopalong starting for the stairs

Come back you chump cried the clerk I dont want any shooting
here What do you care about it Let her have him for its an easy way
out of it for you Let him think hes cut you out for hell spend all
the more freely Get your crowd and enlighten themitll be better than
a circus This may sound like a steer but its straight

Hopalong thought for a minute and then leaned on the cigar case

I reckon Ill take about a dozen of yore very best cigars Charley Got
any real hightoned brands

Cortez panatellatwo for a simoleon Chancy replied But seein that
its you Ill throw off a dollar on a dozen Theyre a fool notion of
the old man for we cant sell one in a month

Hopalong dug up a handful and threw one on the counter lighting
another Yu light a Cortez panatella with me he said pocketing the
remainder Thats five simoleons she didnt get So long

He journeyed to Tom Lees and found his outfit making merry Passing
around his cigars he leaned against the bar and delighted in the first
really good smoke he had since he came home from Kansas City

Johnny Nelson blew a cloud of smoke at the ceiling and paused with a
pleased expression on his face

This is a lalapoloosa of a cigar he cried Whered yu get it an
how manys left

I got it from Charley an theres more than yu can buy at fifty a
shot

Well Ill just take a few for luck Johnny responded running out
into the street Returning in five minutes with both hands full of
cigars he passed them around and grinned Theyre birds all right

Hopalong smiled turned to Buck and related his conversation with
Chancy What do yu think of that He asked as he finished

I think Charley oughter be yore guardian replied the foreman

He was replied Hopalong

If we sees Tex well all grin hard laughed Red making for the door
Come on to th contestsLankys gone already

Muddy Wells streamed to the carnival grounds and relieved itself of
its enthusiasm and money at the booths on the way Cowpunchers rubbed
elbows with Indians and Mexicans and the few tourists that were present
were delighted with the picturesque scene The town was full of fakirs
and before one of them stood a group of cowpunchers apparently
drinking in the words of a barker

Right this way gents and see the woman who dont eat Lived for two
years without food gents Right this way gents Only a quarter of a
dollar Get your tickets gents and see

Red pushed forward

What did yu say pard He asked Im a little off in my near ear
Whats that about eatin a woman for two years

The greatest wonder of the age gents The wom

Any discount for th gang Asked Buck gawking

Why dont yu quit smokin an buy th lady a meal Asked Johnny from
the center of the group

Th cane yu ring th cane yu get came from the other side of the
street and Hopalong purchased rings for the outfit Twentyfour rings
got one cane and it was divided between them as they wended their way
toward the grounds

That makes six wheels she didnt get murmured Hopalong As they
passed the snake charmers booth they saw Tex and his companion ahead
of them in the crowd and they grinned broadly I like th front row in
th balcony remarked Johnny who had been to Kansas City Dont cry
in th second actit aint real laughed Red Well hang John Brown on
a sour appletreein th Panhandle sang Skinny as they passed them

Arriving at the grounds they hunted up the registration committee and
entered in the contests As Hopalong signed for the revolver competition
he was rudely pushed aside and Tex wrote his name under that of his
enemy Hopalong was about to show quick resentment for the insult but
thought of what Charley had said and he grinned sympathetically The
seats were filling rapidly and the outfit went along the ground looking
for friends A bugle sounded and a hush swept over the crowd as the
announcement was made for the first event

BronchobustingRed Devil never ridden Frenchy McAllister TinCup
Montana Meteor killed his man Skinny Thompson Bar20 Texas Vixen
never ridden Lefty Allen OBarO Texas

All eyes were focused on the plain where the horse was being led out
for the first trial After the usual preliminaries had been gone through
Frenchy walked over to it vaulted in the saddle and the bandage was
torn from the animals eyes For ten minutes the onlookers were held
spellbound by the fight before them and then the horse kicked and
galloped away and Frenchy was picked up and carried from the field

Too bad cried Buck running from the outfit

Did yu see it asked Johnny excitedly Th cinch busted Another
horse was led out and Skinny Thompson vaulted to the saddle and after
a fight of half an hour rode the animal from the enclosure to the
clamorous shouts of his friends Lefty Allen also rode his mount from
the same gate but took ten minutes more in which to do it

The announcer conferred with the timekeepers and then stepped forward
First Skinny Thompson Bar20 thirty minutes and ten seconds second
Lefty Allen OBarO forty minutes and seven seconds

Skinny returned to his friends shamefacedly and did not look as if he
had just won a championship They made way for him and Johnny who
could not restrain his enthusiasm pounded him on the back and cried Yu
old sonofagun

The announcer again came forward and gave out the competitors for the
next contest steerroping and tying Lanky Smith arose and coiling his
rope carefully disappeared into the crowd The fun was not so great in
this but when he returned to his outfit with the phenomenal time of six
minutes and eight seconds for his string of ten steers with twentytwo
seconds for one of them they gave him vociferous greeting Three of his
steers had gotten up after he had leaped from his saddle to tie them
but his horse had taken care of that His nearest rival was one minute
over him and Lanky retained the championship

Red Connors shot with such accuracy in the rifle contest as to run his
points twenty per cent higher than Waffles of the OBarO and won the
new rifle

The main interest centered in the revolver contest for it was known
that the present champion was to defend his title against an enemy and
fears were expressed in the crowd that there would be an accident
Buck Peters and Red stood just behind the firing line with their hands
on hips and Tex seeing the precautions smiled grimly as he advanced
to the line

Six bottles with their necks an inch above a board stood twenty paces
from him and he broke them all in as many shots taking twelve seconds
in which to do it Hopalong followed him and tied the score Three tin
balls rolling erratically in a blanket supported by two men were
sent flying into the air in four shots Tex taking six seconds His
competitor sent them from the blanket in three shots and in the same
time In slow shooting from sights Tex passed his rival in points and
stood to win There was but one more event to be contested and in it
Hopalong found his joy

Shooting from the hip when the draw is timed is not the sport of even
good shots and when Tex made sixty points out of a possible hundred he
felt that he had shot well When Hopalong went to the line his
friends knew that they would now see shooting such as would be almost
unbelievable that the best drawandshoot marksman in their State was
the man who limped slightly as he advanced and who chewed reflectively
on his fiftycent cigar He wore two guns and he stepped with confidence
before the marshal of the town who was also judge of the contest

The iron ball which lay on the ground was small enough for the use of a
rifle and could hardly be seen from the rear seats of the amphitheater
There was a word spoken by the timekeeper and a gloved hand flashed
down and up and the ball danced and spun and leaped and rolled as shot
after shot followed it with a precision and speed which brought the
audience to a heavy silence Taking the gun which Buck tossed to him
and throwing it into the empty holster he awaited the signal and then
smoke poured from his hips and the ball jumped continuously Both guns
emptied in the twohand shooting he wheeled and jerked loose the guns
which the marshal wore spinning around without a pause the target
hardly ceasing in its rolling Under his arms he shot backward and
between his legs leaping from side to side ducking and dodging
following the ball wherever it went Reloading the weapons quickly
he stepped forward and followed the ball until once more his guns
were empty Then he turned and walked back to the side of the marshal
smiling a little His friends and there were many in the crowd torn
from their affected nonchalance by shooting the like of which they had
not attributed even to him roared and shouted and danced in a frenzy of
delight

Red also threw his guns to Hopalong who caught them in the air and
turning faced Tex who stood white of face and completely lost in the
forgetfulness of admiration and amazement The guns jerked again and a
button flew from the buckskin shirt of his enemy another tore a flower
from his breast and another drove it into the ground at his feet as
others stirred his hair and cut the buckle off his pretty sombrero Tex
dazed but wise enough to stand quiet felt his belt tear loose and drop
to his feet felt a spur rip from its strap and saw his cigarette leap
from his lips Throwing the guns to Red Hopalong laughed and abruptly
turned and was lost in the crowd

For several seconds there was silence but when the dazed minds realized
what their eyes had seen there arose a roar which shook the houses in
the town Roar after roar thundered forth and was sent crashing back
again by the distant walls sweeping down on the discomfited dude and
causing him to slink into the crowd to find a place less conspicuous He
was white yet and keen fear gripped his heart as he realized that he had
come to the carnival with the expressed purpose of killing his enemy in
fair combat The whole town knew it for he had taken pains to spread
the news

The woman he had been with knew it from words which she had overheard
while on her way to the grounds with him His friends knew it and would
laugh him into forgetfulness as the fool who boasted Now he understood
why he had lost so many friends they had attempted what he had sworn to
attempt Look where he would he could see only a smokewrapped demon who
moved and shot with a speed incredible There was reason why Slim had
died There was reason why Porous and Silent had paled when they learned
of their mission

He hated his conspicuous clothes and his pretty broncho and the
woman who had gotten him to squander his money and who was doubtless
convulsed with laughter at his expense He worked himself into a passion
which knew no fear and he ran for the streets of the town there to
make good his boast or to die When he found his enemy he felt himself
grasped with a grip of steel and Buck Peters swung him around and
grinned maliciously in his face

You plaything hoarsely whispered the foreman Why dont yu get away
while yu can Why do yu want to throw yoreself against certain death I
dont want my pleasure marred by a murder an that is what it will
be if yu makes a gunplay at Hopalong Hell shoot yu as he did yore
buttons Take yore pretty clothes an yore pretty cayuse an go where
this is not known an if ever again yu feels like killing Hopalong get
drunk an forget it
