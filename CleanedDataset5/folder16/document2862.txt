THE TWINS OF TABLE MOUNTAIN




CHAPTER I


A CLOUD ON THE MOUNTAIN


They lived on the verge of a vast stony level upheaved so far above
the surrounding country that its vague outlines viewed from the nearest
valley seemed a mere cloudstreak resting upon the lesser hills The
rush and roar of the turbulent river that washed its eastern base were
lost at that height the winds that strove with the giant pines that
half way climbed its flanks spent their fury below the summit for at
variance with most meteorological speculation an eternal calm seemed
to invest this serene altitude The few Alpine flowers seldom
thrilled their petals to a passing breeze rain and snow fell alike
perpendicularly heavily and monotonously over the granite bowlders
scattered along its brown expanse Although by actual measurement an
inconsiderable elevation of the Sierran range and a mere shoulder of
the nearest whitefaced peak that glimmered in the west it seemed
to lie so near the quiet passionless stars that at night it caught
something of their calm remoteness

The articulate utterance of such a locality should have been a whisper
a laugh or exclamation was discordant and the ordinary tones of the
human voice on the night of the 15th of May 1868 had a grotesque
incongruity

In the thick darkness that clothed the mountain that night the human
figure would have been lost or confounded with the outlines of outlying
bowlders which at such times took upon themselves the vague semblance
of men and animals Hence the voices in the following colloquy seemed
the more grotesque and incongruous from being the apparent expression
of an upright monolith ten feet high on the right and another mass of
granite that reclining peeped over the verge

Hello

Hello yourself

Youre late

I lost the trail and climbed up the slide

Here followed a stumble the clatter of stones down the mountainside
and an oath so very human and undignified that it at once relieved the
bowlders of any complicity of expression The voices too were close
together now and unexpectedly in quite another locality

Anything up

Looey Napoleons declared war agin Germany

Shooo

Notwithstanding this exclamation the interest of the latter speaker was
evidently only polite and perfunctory What indeed were the political
convulsions of the Old World to the dwellers on this serene isolated
eminence of the New

I reckon its so continued the first voice French Pete and that
thar feller that keeps the Dutch grocery hev hed a row over it emptied
their sixshooters into each other The Dutchmans got two balls in
his leg and the Frenchmans got an onnessary buttonhole in his
shirtbuzzum and hez caved in

This concise local corroboration of the conflict of remote nations
however confirmatory did not appear to excite any further interest
Even the last speaker now that he was in this calm dispassionate
atmosphere seemed to lose his own concern in his tidings and to have
abandoned every thing of a sensational and lowerworldly character in
the pines below There were a few moments of absolute silence and then
another stumble But now the voices of both speakers were quite patient
and philosophical

Hold on and Ill strike a light said the second speaker I brought
a lantern along but I didnt light up I kem out afore sundown and you
know how it allers is up yer I didnt want it and didnt keer to light
up I forgot youre always a little dazed and strangelike when you
first come up

There was a crackle a flash and presently a steady glow which the
surrounding darkness seemed to resent The faces of the two men thus
revealed were singularly alike The same thin narrow outline of jaw and
temple the same dark grave eyes the same brown growth of curly beard
and mustache which concealed the mouth and hid what might have been
any individual idiosyncrasy of thought or expressionshowed them to
be brothers or better known as the Twins of Table Mountain A certain
animation in the face of the second speakerthe firstcomera
certain light in his eye might have at first distinguished him but
even this faded out in the steady glow of the lantern and had no
value as a permanent distinction for by the time they had reached
the western verge of the mountain the two faces had settled into a
homogeneous calmness and melancholy

The vague horizon of darkness that a few feet from the lantern still
encompassed them gave no indication of their progress until their feet
actually trod the rude planks and thatch that formed the roof of their
habitation for their cabin half burrowed in the mountain and half
clung like a swallows nest to the side of the deep declivity that
terminated the northern limit of the summit Had it not been for the
windlass of a shaft a coil of rope and a few heaps of stone and
gravel which were the only indications of human labor in that stony
field there was nothing to interrupt its monotonous dead level And
when they descended a dozen wellworn steps to the door of their cabin
they left the summit as before lonely silent motionless its long
level uninterrupted basking in the cold light of the stars

The simile of a nest as applied to the cabin of the brothers was no
mere figure of speech as the light of the lantern first flashed upon it
The narrow ledge before the door was strewn with feathers A suggestion
that it might be the home and haunt of predatory birds was promptly
checked by the spectacle of the nailedup carcasses of a dozen hawks
against the walls and the outspread wings of an extended eagle
emblazoning the gable above the door like an armorial bearing Within
the cabin the walls and chimneypiece were dazzlingly bedecked with the
partycolored wings of jays yellowbirds woodpeckers kingfishers and
the polytinted woodduck Yet in that dry highlyrarefied atmosphere
there was not the slightest suggestion of odor or decay

The first speaker hung the lantern upon a hook that dangled from the
rafters and going to the broad chimney kicked the halfdead embers
into a sudden resentful blaze He then opened a rude cupboard and
without looking around called Ruth

The second speaker turned his head from the open doorway where he was
leaning as if listening to something in the darkness and answered
abstractedly

Rand

I dont believe you have touched grub today

Ruth grunted out some indifferent reply

Thar hezent been a slice cut off that bacon since I left continued
Rand bringing a side of bacon and some biscuits from the cupboard and
applying himself to the discussion of them at the table Youre gettin
off yer feet Ruth Whats up

Ruth replied by taking an uninvited seat beside him and resting his
chin on the palms of his hands He did not eat but simply transferred
his inattention from the door to the table

Youre workin too many hours in the shaft continued Rand Youre
always up to some such dn fool business when Im not yer

I dipped a little west today Ruth went on without heeding the
brotherly remonstrance and struck quartz and pyrites

Thets youallers dippin west or east for quartz and the color
instead of keeping on plumb down to the cement


  The local name for goldbearing alluvial driftthe bed
 of a prehistoric river


Weve been three years digging for cement said Ruth more in
abstraction than in reproachthree years

And we may be three years moremay be only three days Why you
couldnt be more impatient ififif you lived in a valley

Delivering this tremendous comparison as an unanswerable climax Rand
applied himself once more to his repast Ruth after a moments pause
without speaking or looking up disengaged his hand from under his chin
and slid it along palm uppermost on the table beside his brother
Thereupon Rand slowly reached forward his left hand the right being
engaged in conveying victual to his mouth and laid it on his brothers
palm The act was evidently an habitual half mechanical one for in
a few moments the hands were as gently disengaged without comment or
expression At last Rand leaned back in his chair laid down his knife
and fork and complacently loosening the belt that held his revolver
threw it and the weapon on his bed Taking out his pipe and chipping
some tobacco on the table he said carelessly I came a piece through
the woods with Mornie just now

The face that Ruth turned upon his brother was very distinct in its
expression at that moment and quite belied the popular theory that
the twins could not be told apart Thet gal continued Rand without
looking up is either flighty oror suthin he added in vague
disgust pushing the table from him as if it were the lady in question
Dont tell me

Ruths eyes quickly sought his brothers and were as quickly averted
as he asked hurriedly How

What gets me continued Rand in a petulant non sequitur is that YOU
my own twinbrother never lets on about her comin yer permiskus like
when I aint yer and you and her gallivantin and promanadin and
swoppin sentiments and mottoes

Ruth tried to contradict his blushing face with a laugh of worldly
indifference

She came up yer on a sort of pasear

Oh yesa short cut to the creek interpolated Rand satirically

Last Tuesday or Wednesday continued Ruth with affected
forgetfulness

Oh in course Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday Youve so many folks
climbing up this yer mountain to call on ye continued the ironical
Rand that you disremember only you remembered enough not to tell me
SHE did She took me for you or pretended to

The color dropped from Ruths cheek

Took you for me he asked with an awkward laugh

Yes sneered Rand chirped and chattered away about OUR picnic OUR
nosegays and lord knows what Said shed keep them bluejays wings
and wear em in her hat Spouted poetry toothe same sort o rot you
get off now and then

Ruth laughed again but rather ostentatiously and nervously

Ruth look yer

Ruth faced his brother

Whats your little game Do you mean to say you dont know what thet
gal is Do you mean to say you dont know thet shes the laughingstock
of the Ferry thet her fathers a dd old fool and her mothers a
drunkard and worse thet shes got any right to be hanging round yer
You cant mean to marry her even if you kalkilate to turn me out to do
it for she wouldnt live alone with ye up here Taint her kind And
if I thought you was thinking of

What said Ruth turning upon his brother quickly

Oh thets right holler swear and yell and break things do Tear
round continued Rand kicking his boots off in a corner just because
I ask you a civil question Thats brotherly he added jerking his
chair away against the side of the cabin aint it

Shes not to blame because her mother drinks and her fathers a
shyster said Ruth earnestly and strongly The men who make her the
laughingstock of the Ferry tried to make her something worse and
failed and take this sneaks revenge on her Laughingstock Yes
they knew she could turn the tables on them

Of course go on Shes better than me I know Im a fratricide thats
what I am said Rand throwing himself on the upper of the two berths
that formed the bedstead of the cabin

Ive seen her three times continued Ruth

And youve known me twenty years interrupted his brother

Ruth turned on his heel and walked towards the door

Thats right go on Why dont you get the chalk

Ruth made no reply Rand descended from the bed and taking a piece of
chalk from the shelf drew a line on the floor dividing the cabin in
two equal parts

You can have the east half he said as he climbed slowly back into
bed

This mysterious rite was the usual termination of a quarrel between the
twins Each man kept his half of the cabin until the feud was forgotten
It was the mark of silence and separation over which no words of
recrimination argument or even explanation were delivered until
it was effaced by one or the other This was considered equivalent to
apology or reconciliation which each were equally bound in honor to
accept

It may be remarked that the floor was much whiter at this line of
demarcation and under the fresh chalkline appeared the faint evidences
of one recently effaced

Without apparently heeding this potential ceremony Ruth remained
leaning against the doorway looking upon the night the bulk of whose
profundity and blackness seemed to be gathered below him The vault
above was serene and tranquil with a few large farspaced stars the
abyss beneath untroubled by sight or sound Stepping out upon the
ledge he leaned far over the shelf that sustained their cabin
and listened A faint rhythmical roll rising and falling in long
undulations against the invisible horizon to his accustomed ears told
him the wind was blowing among the pines in the valley Yet mingling
with this familiar sound his ear now morbidly acute seemed to detect
a stranger inarticulate murmur as of confused and excited voices
swelling up from the mysterious depths to the stars above and again
swallowed up in the gulfs of silence below He was roused from a
consideration of this phenomenon by a faint glow towards the east which
at last brightened until the dark outline of the distant walls of the
valley stood out against the sky Were his other senses participating in
the delusion of his ears for with the brightening light came the faint
odor of burning timber

His face grew anxious as he gazed At last he rose and reentered the
cabin His eyes fell upon the faint chalkmark and taking his soft
felt hat from his head with a few practical sweeps of the brim he
brushed away the ominous record of their late estrangement Going to the
bed whereon Rand lay stretched openeyed he would have laid his hand
upon his arm lightly but the brothers fingers sought and clasped his
own Get up he said quietly theres a strange fire in the Canyon
head that I cant make out

Rand slowly clambered from his shelf and hand in hand the brothers
stood upon the ledge Its a right smart chance beyond the Ferry and a
piece beyond the Mill too said Rand shading his eyes with his hand
from force of habit Its in the woods where He would have added
where he met Mornie but it was a point of honor with the twins after
reconciliation not to allude to any topic of their recent disagreement

Ruth dropped his brothers hand It doesnt smell like the woods he
said slowly

Smell repeated Rand incredulously Why its twenty miles in a
beeline yonder Smell indeed

Ruth was silent but presently fell to listening again with his former
abstraction You dont hear anything do you he asked after a pause

Its blowin in the pines on the river said Rand shortly

You dont hear anything else

No

Nothing likelikelike

Rand who had been listening with an intensity that distorted the left
side of his face interrupted him impatiently

Like what

Like a woman sobbin

Ruth said Rand suddenly looking up in his brothers face whats
gone of you

Ruth laughed The fires out he said abruptly reentering the cabin
Im goin to turn in

Rand following his brother half reproachfully saw him divest himself
of his clothing and roll himself in the blankets of his bed

Goodnight Randy

Rand hesitated He would have liked to ask his brother another question
but there was clearly nothing to be done but follow his example

Goodnight Ruthy he said and put out the light As he did so the
glow in the eastern horizon faded too and darkness seemed to well up
from the depths below and flowing in the open door wrapped them in
deeper slumber


CHAPTER II


THE CLOUDS GATHER


Twelve months had elapsed since the quarrel and reconciliation during
which interval no reference was made by either of the brothers to the
cause which had provoked it Rand was at work in the shaft Ruth having
that morning undertaken the replenishment of the larder with game
from the wooded skirt of the mountain Rand had taken advantage of his
brothers absence to prospect in the drifta proceeding utterly at
variance with his previous condemnation of all such speculative essay
but Rand despite his assumption of a superior practical nature was not
above certain local superstitions Having that morning put on his gray
flannel shirt wrong side outan abstraction recognized among the
miners as the sure forerunner of divination and treasurediscoveryhe
could not forego that opportunity of trying his luck without
hazarding a dangerous example He was also conscious of feeling
chipperanother local expression for buoyancy of spirit not common
to men who work fifty feet below the surface without the stimulus of
air and sunshine and not to be overlooked as an important factor in
fortunate adventure Nevertheless noon came without the discovery of
any treasure He had attacked the walls on either side of the lateral
drift skilfully so as to expose their quality without destroying
their cohesive integrity but had found nothing Once or twice
returning to the shaft for rest and air its grim silence had seemed to
him pervaded with some vague echo of cheerful holiday voices above This
set him to thinking of his brothers equally extravagant fancy of
the wailing voices in the air on the night of the fire and of his
attributing it to a lovers abstraction

I laid it to his being struck after that gal and yet Rand continued
to himself heres me who havent been foolin round no gal and dog
my skin if I didnt think I heard one singin up thar He put his foot
on the lower round of the ladder paused and slowly ascended a dozen
steps Here he paused again All at once the whole shaft was filled with
the musical vibrations of a womans song Seizing the rope that hung
idly from the windlass he half climbed half swung himself to the
surface

The voice was there but the sudden transition to the dazzling level
before him at first blinded his eyes so that he took in only by degrees
the unwonted spectacle of the singera pretty girl standing on tiptoe
on a bowlder not a dozen yards from him utterly absorbed in tying a
gaylystriped neckerchief evidently taken from her own plump throat to
the halliards of a freshlycut hickorypole newly reared as a flagstaff
beside her The hickorypole the halliards the fluttering scarf
the young lady herself were all glaring innovations on the familiar
landscape but Rand with his hand still on the rope silently and
demurely enjoyed it

For the better understanding of the general reader who does not live on
an isolated mountain it may be observed that the young ladys position
on the rock exhibited some study of POSE and a certain exaggeration of
attitude that betrayed the habit of an audience also that her voice
had an artificial accent that was not wholly unconscious even in this
lofty solitude Yet the very next moment when she turned and caught
Rands eye fixed upon her she started naturally colored slightly
uttered that feminine adjuration Good Lord gracious goodness me
which is seldom used in reference to its effect upon the hearer and
skipped instantly from the bowlder to the ground Here however she
alighted in a POSE brought the right heel of her neatlyfitting left
boot closely into the hollowed side of her right instep at the same
moment deftly caught her flying skirt whipped it around her ankles
and slightly raising it behind permitted the chaste display of an inch
or two of frilled white petticoat The most irreverent critic of the sex
will I think admit that it has some movements that are automatic

Hope I didnt disturb ye said Rand pointing to the flagstaff

The young lady slightly turned her head No she said but I didnt
know anybody was here of course Our PARTYshe emphasized the word
and accompanied it with a look toward the further extremity of the
plateau to show she was not aloneour party climbed this ridge
and put up this pole as a sign to show they did it The ridiculous
selfcomplacency of this record in the face of a man who was evidently
a dweller on the mountain apparently struck her for the first time We
didnt know she stammered looking at the shaft from which Rand had
emerged thatthat She stopped and glancing again towards the
distant range where her friends had disappeared began to edge away

They cant be far off interposed Rand quietly as if it were the most
natural thing in the world for the lady to be there Table Mountain
aint as big as all that Dont you be scared So you thought nobody
lived up here

She turned upon him a pair of honest hazel eyes which not only
contradicted the somewhat meretricious smartness of her dress but was
utterly inconsistent with the palpable artificial color of her hairan
obvious imitation of a certain popular fashion then known in artistic
circles as the British Blondeand began to ostentatiously resume a
pair of lemoncolored kid gloves Having as it were thus indicated her
standing and respectability and put an immeasurable distance between
herself and her bold interlocutor she said impressively We
evidently made a mistake I will rejoin our party who will of course
apologize

Whats your hurry said the imperturbable Rand disengaging himself
from the rope and walking towards her As long as youre up here you
might stop a spell

I have no wish to intrude that is our party certainly has not
continued the young lady pulling the tight gloves and smoothing the
plump almost bursting fingers with an affectation of fashionable ease

Oh I havent any thing to do just now said Rand and its about
grub time I reckon Yes I live here Ruth and meright here

The young woman glanced at the shaft

No not down there said Rand following her eye with a laugh Come
here and Ill show you

A strong desire to keep up an appearance of genteel reserve and an
equally strong inclination to enjoy the adventurous company of this
goodlooking hearty young fellow made her hesitate Perhaps she
regretted having undertaken a role of such dignity at the beginning she
could have been so perfectly natural with this perfectly natural man
whereas any relaxation now might increase his familiarity And yet she
was not without a vague suspicion that her dignity and her gloves
were alike thrown away on hima fact made the more evident when
Rand stepped to her side and without any apparent consciousness of
disrespect or gallantry laid his large hand half persuasively half
fraternally upon her shoulder and said Oh come along do

The simple act either exceeded the limits of her forbearance or decided
the course of her subsequent behavior She instantly stepped back a
single pace and drew her left foot slowly and deliberately after her
then she fixed her eyes and uplifted eyebrows upon the daring hand
and taking it by the ends of her thumb and forefinger lifted it and
dropped it in midair She then folded her arms It was the indignant
gesture with which Alice the Pride of Dumballin Village received the
loathsome advances of the bloated aristocrat Sir Parkyns Parkyn and
had at Marysville a few nights before brought down the house

This effect was I think however lost upon Rand The slight color that
rose to his cheek as he looked down upon his claysoiled hands was due
to the belief that he had really contaminated her outward superfine
person But his color quickly passed his frank boyish smile returned
as he said Itll rub off Lord dont mind that Thar nowcome on

The young woman bit her lip Then nature triumphed and she laughed
although a little scornfully And then Providence assisted her with the
sudden presentation of two figures a man and woman slowly climbing up
over the mountain verge not far from them With a cry of Theres Sol
now she forgot her dignity and her confusion and ran towards them

Rand stood looking after her neat figure less concerned in the advent
of the strangers than in her sudden caprice He was not so young and
inexperienced but that he noted certain ambiguities in her dress and
manner he was by no means impressed by her dignity But he could not
help watching her as she appeared to be volubly recounting her late
interview to her companions and still unconscious of any impropriety
or obtrusiveness he lounged down lazily towards her Her humor had
evidently changed for she turned an honest pleased face upon him as
she girlishly attempted to drag the strangers forward

The man was plump and short unlike the natives of the locality he was
closely cropped and shaven as if to keep down the strong blueblackness
of his beard and hair which nevertheless asserted itself over his round
cheeks and upper lip like a tattooing of Indian ink The woman at his
side was reserved and indistinctive with that appearance of being an
unenthusiastic family servant peculiar to some mens wives When Rand
was within a few feet of him he started struck a theatrical attitude
and shading his eyes with his hand cried What do me eyes deceive
me burst into a hearty laugh darted forward seized Rands hand and
shook it briskly

Pinkney Pinkney my boy how are you And this is your little prop
your quartersection your countryseat that weve been trespassing on
eh A nice little spot cool sequestered remotea trifle unimproved
carriageroad as yet unfinished Ha ha But to think of our making
a discovery of this inaccessible mountain climbing it sir for two
mortal hours christening it Sols Peak getting up a flagpole
unfurling our standard to the breeze sir and then by Gad winding up
by finding Pinkney the festive Pinkney living on it at home

Completely surprised but still perfectly goodhumored Rand shook the
strangers right hand warmly and received on his broad shoulders a
welcoming thwack from the left without question She dont mind her
friends making free with ME evidently said Rand to himself as he
tried to suggest that fact to the young lady in a meaning glance

The stranger noted his glance and suddenly passed his hand thoughtfully
over his shaven cheeks No he saidyes surely I forgetyes I
see of course you dont Rosy turning to his wife of course Pinkney
doesnt know Phemie eh

No nor ME either Sol said that lady warningly

Certainly continued Sol Its his misfortune You werent with me
at Gold HillAllow me he said turning to Rand to present Mrs Sol
Saunders wife of the undersigned and Miss Euphemia Neville otherwise
known as the Marysville Pet the best variety actress known on the
provincial boards Played Ophelia at Marysville Friday domestic drama
at Gold Hill Saturday Sunday night four songs in character different
dress each time and a clogdance The best clogdance on the Pacific
Slope he added in a stage aside The minstrels are crazy to get her
in Frisco But money cant buy herprefers the legitimate drama to
this sort of thing Here he took a few steps of a jig to which the
Marysville Pet beat time with her feet and concluded with a laugh
and a winkthe combined expression of an artists admiration for her
ability and a man of the worlds scepticism of feminine ambition

Miss Euphemia responded to the formal introduction by extending her hand
frankly with a reassuring smile to Rand and an utter obliviousness of
her former hauteur Rand shook it warmly and then dropped carelessly on
a rock beside them

And you never told me you lived up here in the attic you rascal
continued Sol with a laugh

No replied Rand simply How could I I never saw you before that I
remember

Miss Euphemia stared at Sol Mrs Sol looked up in her lords face and
folded her arms in a resigned expression Sol rose to his feet again
and shaded his eyes with his hand but this time quite seriously and
gazed at Rands smiling face

Good Lord Do you mean to say your name isnt Pinkney he asked with
a half embarrassed laugh

It IS Pinkney said Rand but I never met you before

Didnt you come to see a young lady that joined my troupe at Gold Hill
last month and say youd meet me at Keelers Ferry in a day or two

Nooo said Rand with a goodhumored laugh I havent left this
mountain for two months

He might have added more but his attention was directed to Miss
Euphemia who during this short dialogue having stuffed alternately her
handkerchief the corner of her mantle and her gloves into her mouth
restrained herself no longer but gave way to an uncontrollable fit
of laughter O Sol she gasped explanatorily as she threw herself
alternately against him Mrs Sol and a bowlder youll kill me yet
O Lord first we take possession of this mans property then we claim
HIM The contemplation of this humorous climax affected her so that
she was fain at last to walk away and confide the rest of her speech to
space

Sol joined in the laugh until his wife plucked his sleeve and whispered
something in his ear In an instant his face became at once mysterious
and demure I owe you an apology he said turning to Rand but in a
voice ostentatiously pitched high enough for Miss Euphemia to overhear
I see I have made a mistake A resemblanceonly a mere resemblance
as I look at you nowled me astray Of course you dont know any young
lady in the profession

Of course he doesnt Sol said Miss Euphemia I could have told you
that He didnt even know ME

The voice and mockheroic attitude of the speaker was enough to relieve
the general embarrassment with a laugh Rand now pleasantly conscious
of only Miss Euphemias presence again offered the hospitality of his
cabin with the polite recognition of her friends in the sentence and
you might as well come along too

But wont we incommode the lady of the house said Mrs Sol politely

What lady of the house said Rand almost angrily

Why Ruth you know

It was Rands turn to become hilarious Ruth he said is short
for Rutherford my brother His laugh however was echoed only by
Euphemia

Then you have a brother said Mrs Sol benignly

Yes said Rand he will be here soon A sudden thought dropped the
color from his cheek Look here he said turning impulsively upon
Sol I have a brother a twinbrother It couldnt be HIM

Sol was conscious of a significant feminine pressure on his right arm
He was equal to the emergency I think not he said dubiously unless
your brothers hair is much darker than yours Yes now I look at you
yours is brown He has a mole on his right cheek hasnt he

The red came quickly back to Rands boyish face He laughed No sir
my brothers hair is if any thing a shade lighter than mine and nary
mole Come along

And leading the way Rand disclosed the narrow steps winding down to the
shelf on which the cabin hung Be careful said Rand taking the now
unresisting hand of the Marysville Pet as they descended a step that
way and down you go two thousand feet on the top of a pinetree

But the girls slight cry of alarm was presently changed to one of
unaffected pleasure as they stood on the rocky platform It isnt a
house its a NEST and the loveliest said Euphemia breathlessly

Its a scene a perfect scene sir said Sol enraptured I shall
take the liberty of bringing my scenepainter to sketch it some day
It would do for The Mountaineers Bride superbly or continued
the little man warming through the blueblack border of his face with
professional enthusiasm its enough to make a play itself The Cot on
the Crags Last scenemoonlightthe struggle on the ledge The Lady
of the Crags throws herself from the beetling heightsA shriek from
the depthsa womans wail

Dry up sharply interrupted Rand to whom this speech recalled his
brothers halfforgotten strangeness Look at the prospect

In the full noon of a cloudless day beneath them a tumultuous sea of
pines surged heaved rode in giant crests stretched and lost itself
in the ghostly snowpeaked horizon The thronging woods choked every
defile swept every crest filled every valley with its darkgreen
tilting spears and left only Table Mountain sunlit and bare Here and
there were profound olive depths over which the gray hawk hung lazily
and into which blue jays dipped A faint dull yellowish streak marked
an occasional watercourse a deeper reddish ribbon the mountain road
and its overhanging murky cloud of dust

Is it quite safe here asked Mrs Sol eying the little cabin I mean
from storms

It never blows up here replied Rand and nothing happens

It must be lovely said Euphemia clasping her hands

It IS that said Rand proudly Its four years since Ruth and I took
up this yer claim and raised this shanty In that four years we havent
left it alone a night or cared to Its only big enough for two and
them two must be brothers It wouldnt do for mere pardners to live here
alonethey couldnt do it It wouldnt be exactly the thing for man
and wife to shut themselves up here alone But Ruth and me know
each others ways and here well stay until weve made a pile We
sometimesone of ustakes a pasear to the Ferry to buy provisions but
were glad to crawl up to the back of old Table at night

Youre quite out of the world here then suggested Mrs Sol

Thats it just it Were out of the worldout of rows out of
liquor out of cards out of bad company out of temptation Cussedness
and foolishness hez got to follow us up here to find us and theres too
many ready to climb down to them things to tempt em to come up to us

There was a little boyish conceit in his tone as he stood there not
altogether unbecoming his fresh color and simplicity Yet when his
eyes met those of Miss Euphemia he colored he hardly knew why and the
young lady herself blushed rosily

When the neat cabin with its decorated walls and squirrel and wildcat
skins was duly admired the luncheonbasket of the Saunders party was
reenforced by provisions from Rands larder and spread upon the
ledge the dimensions of the cabin not admitting four Under the potent
influence of a bottle Sol became hilarious and professional The Pet
was induced to favor the company with a recitation and under the plea
of teaching Rand to perform the clogdance with both gentlemen Then
there was an interval in which Rand and Euphemia wandered a little way
down the mountainside to gather laurel leaving Mr Sol to his siesta
on a rock and Mrs Sol to take some knitting from the basket and sit
beside him

When Rand and his companion had disappeared Mrs Sol nudged her
sleeping partner Do you think that WAS the brother

Sol yawned Sure of it Theyre as like as two peas in looks

Why didnt you tell him so then

Will you tell me my dear why you stopped me when I began

Because something was said about Ruth being here and I supposed Ruth
was a woman and perhaps Pinkneys wife and knew youd be putting your
foot in it by talking of that other woman I supposed it was for fear of
that he denied knowing you

Well when HEthis Randtold me he had a twinbrother he looked so
frightened that I knew he knew nothing of his brothers doings with that
woman and I threw him off the scent Hes a good fellow but awfully
green and I didnt want to worry him with tales I like him and I
think Phemie does too

Nonsense Hes a conceited prig Did you hear his sermon on the world
and its temptations I wonder if he thought temptation had come up to
him in the person of us professionals out on a picnic I think it was
positively rude

My dear woman youre always seeing slights and insults I tell you
hes taken a shine to Phemie and hes as good as four seats and a
bouquet to that child next Wednesday evening to say nothing of the
eclat of getting this St Simeonwhat do you call himStalactites

Stylites suggested Mrs Sol

Stylites off from his pillar here Ill have a paragraph in the paper
that the hermit crabs of Table Mountain

Dont be a fool Sol

The hermit twins of Table Mountain bespoke the chaste performance

One of them being the protector of the wellknown Mornie
Nixon responded Mrs Sol viciously accenting the name with her
knittingneedles

Rosy youre unjust Youre prejudiced by the reports of the town
Mr Pinkneys interest in her may be a purely artistic one although
mistaken Shell never make a good varietyactress shes too heavy
And the boys dont give her a fair show No woman can make a debut in my
version of Somnambula and have the front row in the pit say to her in
the sleepwalking scene Youre out rather late Mornie Kinder forgot
to put on your things didnt you Mother sick I suppose and youre
goin for more gin Hurry along or youll ketch it when ye get home
Why you couldnt do it yourself Rosy

To which Mrs Sols illogical climax was that bad as Rutherford might
be this Sundayschool superintendent Rand was worse

Rand and his companion returned late but in high spirits There was
an unnecessary effusiveness in the way in which Euphemia kissed
Mrs Solthe one woman present who UNDERSTOOD and was to be
propitiatedwhich did not tend to increase Mrs Sols good humor
She had her basket packed all ready for departure and even the earnest
solicitation of Rand that they would defer their going until sunset
produced no effect

Mr RandMr Pinkney I meansays the sunsets here are so lovely
pleaded Euphemia

There is a rehearsal at seven oclock and we have no time to lose
said Mrs Sol significantly

I forgot to say said the Marysville Pet timidly glancing at Mrs
Sol that Mr Rand says he will bring his brother on Wednesday night
and wants four seats in front so as not to be crowded

Sol shook the young mans hand warmly Youll not regret it sir its
a surprising a remarkable performance

Id like to go a piece down the mountain with you said Rand with
evident sincerity looking at Miss Euphemia but Ruth isnt here yet
and we make a rule never to leave the place alone Ill show you the
slide its the quickest way to go down If you meet any one who looks
like me and talks like me call him Ruth and tell him Im waitin
for him yer

Miss Phemia the last to go standing on the verge of the declivity
here remarked with a dangerous smile that if she met any one who
bore that resemblance she might be tempted to keep him with hera
playfulness that brought the ready color to Rands cheek When she
added to this the greater audacity of kissing her hand to him the
young hermit actually turned away in sheer embarrassment When he looked
around again she was gone and for the first time in his experience the
mountain seemed barren and lonely

The too sympathetic reader who would rashly deduce from this any newly
awakened sentiment in the virgin heart of Rand would quite misapprehend
that peculiar young man That singular mixture of boyish inexperience
and mature doubt and disbelief which was partly the result of his
temperament and partly of his cloistered life on the mountain made him
regard his late companions now that they were gone and his intimacy
with them with remorseful distrust The mountain was barren and lonely
because it was no longer HIS It had become a part of the great world
which four years ago he and his brother had put aside and in which as
two selfdevoted men they walked alone More than that he believed
he had acquired some understanding of the temptations that assailed
his brother and the poor little vanities of the Marysville Pet were
transformed into the blandishments of a Circe Rand who would have
succumbed to a wicked superior woman believed he was a saint in
withstanding the foolish weakness of a simple one


He did not resume his work that day He paced the mountain anxiously
awaiting his brothers return and eager to relate his experiences He
would go with him to the dramatic entertainment from his example and
wisdom Ruth should learn how easily temptation might be overcome But
first of all there should be the fullest exchange of confidences
and explanations The old rule should be rescinded for once the old
discussion in regard to Mornie reopened and Rand having convinced his
brother of error would generously extend his forgiveness

The sun sank redly Lingering long upon the ledge before their cabin it
at last slipped away almost imperceptibly leaving Rand still wrapped in
revery Darkness the smoke of distant fires in the woods and the faint
evening incense of the pines crept slowly up but Ruth came not The
moon rose a silver gleam on the farther ridge and Rand becoming
uneasy at his brothers prolonged absence resolved to break another
custom and leave the summit to seek him on the trail He buckled on
his revolvers seized his gun when a cry from the depths arrested him
He leaned over the ledge and listened Again the cry arose and this
time more distinctly He held his breath the blood settled around his
heart in superstitious terror It was the wailing voice of a woman

Ruth Ruth for Gods sake come and help me

The blood flew back hotly to Rands cheek It was Mornies voice By
leaning over the ledge he could distinguish something moving along the
almost precipitous face of the cliff where an abandoned trail long
since broken off and disrupted by the fall of a portion of the ledge
stopped abruptly a hundred feet below him Rand knew the trail a
dangerous one always in its present condition a single misstep
would be fatal Would she make that misstep He shook off a horrible
temptation that seemed to be sealing his lips and paralyzing his
limbs and almost screamed to her Drop on your face hang on to the
chaparral and dont move

In another instant with a coil of rope around his arm he was dashing
down the almost perpendicular slide When he had nearly reached the
level of the abandoned trail he fastened one end of the rope to a
jutting splinter of granite and began to lay out and work his
way laterally along the face of the mountain Presently he struck the
regular trail at the point from which the woman must have diverged

It is Rand she said without lifting her head

It is replied Rand coldly Pass the rope under your arms and Ill
get you back to the trail

Where is Ruth she demanded again without moving She was trembling
but with excitement rather than fear

I dont know returned Rand impatiently Come the ledge is already
crumbling beneath our feet

Let it crumble said the woman passionately

Rand surveyed her with profound disgust then passed the rope around her
waist and half lifted half swung her from her feet In a few moments
she began to mechanically help herself and permitted him to guide her
to a place of safety That reached she sank down again

The rising moon shone full upon her face and figure Through his growing
indignation Rand was still impressed and even startled with the change
the few last months had wrought upon her In place of the silly
fanciful halfhysterical hoyden whom he had known a matured woman
strong in passionate selfwill fascinating in a kind of wild savage
beauty looked up at him as if to read his very soul

What are you staring at she said finally Why dont you help me on

Where do you want to go said Rand quietly

Where Up thereshe pointed savagely to the top of the
mountainto HIM Where else should I go she said with a bitter
laugh

Ive told you he wasnt there said Rand roughly He hasnt
returned

Ill wait for himdo you hearwait for him stay there till he
comes If you wont help me Ill go alone

She made a step forward but faltered staggered and was obliged to lean
against the mountain for support Stains of travel were on her dress
lines of fatigue and pain and traces of burning passionate tears were
on her face her black hair flowed from beneath her gaudy bonnet and
shamed out of his brutality Rand placed his strong arm round her waist
and half carrying half supporting her began the ascent Her head
dropped wearily on his shoulder her arm encircled his neck her hair
as if caressingly lay across his breast and hands her grateful eyes
were close to his her breath was upon his cheek and yet his only
consciousness was of the possibly ludicrous figure he might present to
his brother should he meet him with Mornie Nixon in his arms Not a
word was spoken by either till they reached the summit Relieved at
finding his brother still absent he turned not unkindly toward the
helpless figure on his arm I dont see what makes Ruth so late he
said Hes always here by sundown Perhaps

Perhaps he knows Im here said Mornie with a bitter laugh

I didnt say that said Rand and I dont think it What I meant
was he might have met a party that was picnicking here todaySol
Saunders and wife and Miss Euphemia

Mornie flung his arm away from her with a passionate gesture THEY
herepicnicking HEREthose people HERE

Yes said Rand unconsciously a little ashamed They came here
accidentally

Mornies quick passion had subsided she had sunk again wearily and
helplessly on a rock beside him I suppose she said with a weak
laughI suppose they talked of ME I suppose they told you how with
their lies and fair promises they tricked me out and set me before an
audience of brutes and laughing hyenas to make merry over Did they tell
you of the insults that I receivedhow the sins of my parents were
flung at me instead of bouquets Did they tell you they could have
spared me this but they wanted the few extra dollars taken in at the
door No

They said nothing of the kind replied Rand surlily

Then you must have stopped them You were horrified enough to know that
I had dared to take the only honest way left me to make a living I know
you Randolph Pinkney Youd rather see Joaquin Muriatta the Mexican
bandit standing before you tonight with a revolver than the helpless
shamed miserable Mornie Nixon And you cant help yourself unless you
throw me over the cliff Perhaps youd better she said with a bitter
laugh that faded from her lips as she leaned pale and breathless
against the bowlder

Ruth will tell you began Rand

Dn Ruth

Rand turned away

Stop she said suddenly staggering to her feet Im sickfor all
I know dying God grant that it may be so But if you are a man you
will help me to your cabinto some place where I can lie down NOW and
be at rest Im very very tired

She paused She would have fallen again but Rand seeing more in her
face than her voice interpreted to his sullen ears took her sullenly
in his arms and carried her to the cabin Her eyes glanced around the
bright partycolored walls and a faint smile came to her lips as she
put aside her bonnet adorned with a companion pinion of the bright
wings that covered it

Which is Ruths bed she asked

Rand pointed to it

Lay me there

Rand would have hesitated but with another look at her face complied

She lay quite still a moment Presently she said Give me some brandy
or whiskey

Rand was silent and confused

I forgot she added half bitterly I know you have not that commonest
and cheapest of vices

She lay quite still again Suddenly she raised herself partly on her
elbow and in a strong firm voice said Rand

Yes Mornie

If you are wise and practical as you assume to be you will do what I
ask you without a question If you do it AT ONCE you may save yourself
and Ruth some trouble some mortification and perhaps some remorse and
sorrow Do you hear me

Yes

Go to the nearest doctor and bring him here with you

But YOU

Her voice was strong confident steady and patient You can safely
leave me until then

In another moment Rand was plunging down the slide But it was past
midnight when he struggled over the last bowlder up the ascent dragging
the halfexhausted medical wisdom of Browns Ferry on his arm

Ive been gone long doctor said Rand feverishly and she looked SO
deathlike when I left If we should be too late

The doctor stopped suddenly lifted his head and pricked his ears like
a hound on a peculiar scent We ARE too late he said with a slight
professional laugh

Indignant and horrified Rand turned upon him

Listen said the doctor lifting his hand

Rand listened so intently that he heard the familiar moan of the river
below but the great stony field lay silent before him And then borne
across its bare barren bosom like its own articulation came faintly
the feeble wail of a newborn babe


III


STORM


The doctor hurried ahead in the darkness Rand who had stopped
paralyzed at the ominous sound started forward again mechanically but
as the cry arose again more distinctly and the full significance of
the doctors words came to him he faltered stopped and with cheeks
burning with shame and helpless indignation sank upon a stone beside
the shaft and burying his face in his hands fairly gave way to a
burst of boyish tears Yet even then the recollection that he had not
cried since years ago his mothers dying hands had joined his and
Ruths childish fingers together stung him fiercely and dried his
tears in angry heat upon his cheeks

How long he sat there he remembered not what he thought he recalled
not But the wildest and most extravagant plans and resolves availed him
nothing in the face of this forever desecrated home and this shameful
culmination of his ambitious life on the mountain Once he thought of
flight but the reflection that he would still abandon his brother to
shame perhaps a selfcontented shame checked him hopelessly Could he
avert the future He MUST but how Yet he could only sit and stare into
the darkness in dumb abstraction

Sitting there his eyes fell upon a peculiar object in a crevice of
the ledge beside the shaft It was the tin pail containing his dinner
which according to their custom it was the duty of the brother who
staid above ground to prepare and place for the brother who worked
below Ruth must consequently have put it there before he left that
morning and Rand had overlooked it while sharing the repast of the
strangers at noon At the sight of this dumb witness of their mutual
cares and labors Rand sighed half in brotherly sorrow half in a
selfish sense of injury done him

He took up the pail mechanically removed its cover andstarted for
on top of the carefully bestowed provisions lay a little note addressed
to him in Ruths peculiar scrawl

He opened it with feverish hands held it in the light of the peaceful
moon and read as follows


DEAR DEAR BROTHERWhen you read this I shall be far away I go
because I shall not stay to disgrace you and because the girl that I
brought trouble upon has gone away too to hide her disgrace and mine
and where she goes Rand I ought to follow her and please God I
will I am not as wise or as good as you are but it seems the best I
can do and God bless you dear old Randy boy Times and times again
Ive wanted to tell you all and reckoned to do so but whether you was
sitting before me in the cabin or working beside me in the drift I
couldnt get to look upon your honest face dear brother and say what
things Id been keeping from you so long Ill stay away until Ive done
what I ought to do and if you can say Come Ruth I will come but
until you can say it the mountain is yours Randy boy the mine is
yours the cabin is yours ALL is yours Rub out the old chalkmarks
Rand as I rub them out here in myA few words here were blurred and
indistinct as if the moon had suddenly become dimeyed too God bless
you brother

PSYou know I mean Mornie all the time Its she Im going to seek
but dont you think so bad of her as you do I am so much worse than
she I wanted to tell you that all along but I didnt dare Shes run
away from the Ferry half crazy said she was going to Sacramento and
I am going there to find her alive or dead Forgive me brother Dont
throw this down right away hold it in your hand a moment Randy boy
and try hard to think its my hand in yours And so goodby and God
bless you old Randy

From your loving brother

RUTH


A deep sense of relief overpowered every other feeling in Rands breast
It was clear that Ruth had not yet discovered the truth of Mornies
flight he was on his way to Sacramento and before he could return
Mornie could be removed Once despatched in some other direction with
Ruth once more returned and under his brothers guidance the separation
could be made easy and final There was evidently no marriage as yet
and now the fear of an immediate meeting over there should be none
For Rand had already feared this had recalled the few infelicitous
relations legal and illegal which were common to the adjoining
campthe flagrantly miserable life of the husband of a San Francisco
anonyma who lived in style at the Ferry the shameful carousals and more
shameful quarrels of the Frenchman and Mexican woman who kept house
at the Crossing the awful spectacle of the three halfbred Indian
children who played before the cabin of a fellow miner and townsman
Thank Heaven the Eagles Nest on Table Mountain should never be pointed
at from the valley as another

A heavy hand upon his arm brought him trembling to his feet He turned
and met the halfanxious halfcontemptuous glance of the doctor

Im sorry to disturb you he said dryly but its about time you or
somebody else put in an appearance at that cabin Luckily for HER shes
one woman in a thousand has had her wits about her better than some
folks I know and has left me little to do but make her comfortable But
shes gone through too muchfought her little fight too gallantlyis
altogether too much of a trump to be played off upon now So rise up
out of that young man pick up your scattered faculties and fetch a
womansome sensible creature of her own sexto look after her for
without wishing to be personal Im dd if I trust her to the likes
of you

There was no mistaking Dr Duchesne s voice and manner and Rand
was affected by it as most people were throughout the valley of the
Stanislaus But he turned upon him his frank and boyish face and said
simply But I dont know any woman or where to get one

The doctor looked at him again Well Ill find you some one he said
softening

Thank you said Rand

The doctor was disappearing With an effort Rand recalled him One
moment doctor He hesitated and his cheeks were glowing Youll
please say nothing about this down therehe pointed to the
valleyfor a time And youll say to the woman you send

Dr Duchesne whose resolute lips were sealed upon the secrets of half
Tuolumne County interrupted him scornfully I cannot answer for the
womanyou must talk to her yourself As for me generally I keep
my professional visits to myself but he laid his hand on Rands
armif I find out youre putting on any airs to that poor creature
if on my next visit her lips or her pulse tell me you havent been
acting on the square to her Ill drop a hint to drunken old Nixon where
his daughter is hidden I reckon she could stand his brutality better
than yours Goodnight

In another moment he was gone Rand who had held back his quick tongue
feeling himself in the power of this man once more alone sank on a
rock and buried his face in his hands Recalling himself in a moment
he rose wiped his hot eyelids and staggered toward the cabin It was
quite still now He paused on the topmost step and listened there
was no sound from the ledge or the Eagles Nest that clung to it Half
timidly he descended the winding steps and paused before the door
of the cabin Mornie he said in a dry metallic voice whose
only indication of the presence of sickness was in the lowness of its
pitchMornie There was no reply Mornie he repeated impatiently
its meRand If you want anything youre to call me I am just
outside Still no answer came from the silent cabin He pushed open the
door gently hesitated and stepped over the threshold

A change in the interior of the cabin within the last few hours showed
a new presence The guns shovels picks and blankets had disappeared
the two chairs were drawn against the wall the table placed by the
bedside The swinginglantern was shaded towards the bedthe object of
Rands attention On that bed his brothers bed lay a helpless woman
pale from the long black hair that matted her damp forehead and clung
to her hollow cheeks Her face was turned to the wall so that the
softened light fell upon her profile which to Rand at that moment
seemed even noble and strong But the next moment his eye fell upon the
shoulder and arm that lay nearest to him and the little bundle swathed
in flannel that it clasped to her breast His brow grew dark as
he gazed The sleeping woman moved Perhaps it was an instinctive
consciousness of his presence perhaps it was only the current of
cold air from the opened door but she shuddered slightly and still
unconscious drew the child as if away from HIM and nearer to her
breast The shamed blood rushed to Rands face and saying half aloud
Im not going to take your precious babe away from you he turned in
halfboyish pettishness away Nevertheless he came back again shortly to
the bedside and gazed upon them both She certainly did look altogether
more ladylike and less aggressive lying there so still sickness that
cheap refining process of some natures was not unbecoming to her But
this bundle A boyish curiosity stronger than even his strong objection
to the whole episode was steadily impelling him to lift the blanket
from it I suppose shed waken if I did said Rand but Id like to
know what right the doctor had to wrap it up in my best flannel shirt
This fresh grievance the fruit of his curiosity sent him away again to
meditate on the ledge After a few moments he returned again opened the
cupboard at the foot of the bed softly took thence a piece of chalk
and scrawled in large letters upon the door of the cupboard If you
want anything sing out Im just outsideRAND This done he took a
blanket and bearskin from the corner and walked to the door But here
he paused looked back at the inscription evidently not satisfied with
it returned took up the chalk added a line but rubbed it out
again repeated this operation a few times until he produced the polite
postscriptHope youll be better soon Then he retreated to the
ledge spread the bearskin beside the door and rolling himself in
a blanket lit his pipe for his nightlong vigil But Rand although
a martyr a philosopher and a moralist was young In less than ten
minutes the pipe dropped from his lips and he was asleep


He awoke with a strange sense of heat and suffocation and with
difficulty shook off his covering Rubbing his eyes he discovered that
an extra blanket had in some mysterious way been added in the night and
beneath his head was a pillow he had no recollection of placing there
when he went to sleep By degrees the events of the past night forced
themselves upon his benumbed faculties and he sat up The sun was
riding high the door of the cabin was open Stretching himself he
staggered to his feet and looked in through the yawning crack at the
hinges He rubbed his eyes again Was he still asleep and followed by
a dream of yesterday For there even in the very attitude he remembered
to have seen her sitting at her luncheon on the previous day with her
knitting on her lap sat Mrs Sol Saunders What did it mean or had she
really been sitting there ever since and all the events that followed
only a dream

A hand was laid upon his arm and turning he saw the murky black eyes
and Indianinked beard of Sol beside him That gentleman put his finger
on his lips with a theatrical gesture and then slowly retreating in
the wellknown manner of the buried Majesty of Denmark waved him like
another Hamlet to a remoter part of the ledge This reached he grasped
Rand warmly by the hand shook it heartily and said Its all right
my boy all right

But began Rand The hot blood flowed to his cheeks he stammered
and stopped short

Its all right I say Dont you mind Well pull you through

But Mrs Sol what does she

Rosey has taken the matter in hand sir and when that woman takes a
matter in hand whether its a baby or a rehearsal sir she makes it
buzz

But how did she know stammered Rand

How Well sir the scene opened something like this said Sol

thee No it is

Hush said Rand appealingly looking toward the cabin

Hush it is said the actor goodnaturedly But its all right Mr
Rand well pull you through

Later in the morning Rand learned that Mornies illfated connection
with the Star Variety Troupe had been a source of anxiety to Mrs Sol
and she had reproached herself for the girls infelicitous debut

But Lord bless you Mr Rand said Sol it was all in the way of
business She came to uswas fresh and new Her chance looking at
it professionally was as good as any amateurs but what with her
relations here and her bein known she didnt take We lost money on
her Its natural she should feel a little ugly We all do when we get
sorter kicked back onto ourselves and find we cant stand alone Why
you wouldnt believe it he continued with a moist twinkle of his
black eyes but the night I lost my little Rosey of diphtheria in Gold
Hill the child was down on the bills for a comic song and I had to
drag Mrs Sol on cut up as she was and filled up with that much of Old
Bourbon to keep her nerves stiff so she could do an old gag with me
to gain time and make up the variety Why sir when I came to the
front I was ugly And when one of the boys in the front row sang out
Dont expose that poor child to the night air Solmeaning Mrs
SolI acted ugly No sir its human nature and it was quite natural
that Mornie when she caught sight o Mrs Sols face last night should
rise up and cuss us both Lord if shed only acted like that But the
old lady got her quiet at last and as I said before its all right
and well pull her through But dont YOU thank us its a little matter
betwixt us and Mornie Weve got everything fixed so that Mrs Sol can
stay right along Well pull Mornie through and get her away from this
and her baby too as soon as we can You wont get mad if I tell you
something said Sol with a halfapologetic laugh Mrs Sol was
rather down on you the other day hated you on sight and preferred
your brother to you but when she found hed run off and left YOU
youdont mind my sayina mere boy to take what oughter be
HIS place why she just wheeled round agin him I suppose he
got flustered and couldnt face the music Never left a word of
explanation Well it wasnt exactly square though I tell the old woman
its human nature He might have dropped a hint where he was goin
Well there I wont say a word more agin him I know how you feel
Hush it is

It was the firm conviction of the simpleminded Sol that no one knew
the various natural indications of human passion better than himself
Perhaps it was one of the fallacies of his profession that the
expression of all human passion was limited to certain conventional
signs and sounds Consequently when Rand colored violently became
confused stammered and at last turned hastily away the goodhearted
fellow instantly recognized the unfailing evidence of modesty and
innocence embarrassed by recognition As for Rand I fear his shame
was only momentary Confirmed in the belief of his ulterior wisdom and
virtue his first embarrassment over he was not displeased with this
halfway tribute and really believed that the time would come when
Mr Sol should eventually praise his sagacity and reservation
and acknowledge that he was something more than a mere boy He
nevertheless shrank from meeting Mornie that morning and was glad that
the presence of Mrs Sol relieved him from that duty

The day passed uneventfully Rand busied himself in his usual
avocations and constructed a temporary shelter for himself and Sol
beside the shaft besides rudely shaping a few necessary articles of
furniture for Mrs Sol

It will be a little spell yet afore Mornies able to be moved
suggested Sol and you might as well be comfortable

Rand sighed at this prospect yet presently forgot himself in the
good humor of his companion whose admiration for himself he began to
patronizingly admit There was no sense of degradation in accepting the
friendship of this man who had traveled so far seen so much and yet
as a practical man of the world Rand felt was so inferior to himself
The absence of Miss Euphemia who had early left the mountain was a
source of odd halfdefinite relief Indeed when he closed his eyes to
rest that night it was with a sense that the reality of his situation
was not as bad as he had feared Once only the figure of his
brotherhaggard weary and footsore on his hopeless quest wandering
in lonely trails and lonelier settlementscame across his fancy but
with it came the greater fear of his return and the pathetic figure was
banished And besides hes in Sacramento by this time and like
as not forgotten us all he muttered and twining this poppy and
mandragora around his pillow he fell asleep

His spirits had quite returned the next morning and once or twice he
found himself singing while at work in the shaft The fear that Ruth
might return to the mountain before he could get rid of Mornie and
the slight anxiety that had grown upon him to know something of his
brothers movements and to be able to govern them as he wished caused
him to hit upon the plan of constructing an ingenious advertisement to
be published in the San Francisco journals wherein the missing Ruth
should be advised that news of his quest should be communicated to him
by a friend through the same medium after an interval of two weeks
Full of this amiable intention he returned to the surface to dinner
Here to his momentary confusion he met Miss Euphemia who in absence
of Sol was assisting Mrs Sol in the details of the household

If the honest frankness with which that young lady greeted him was not
enough to relieve his embarrassment he would have forgotten it in
the utterly new and changed aspect she presented Her extravagant
walkingcostume of the previous day was replaced by some bright calico
a little white apron and a broadbrimmed strawhat which seemed to
Rand in some odd fashion to restore her original girlish simplicity
The change was certainly not unbecoming to her If her waist was not
as tightly pinched a la mode there still was an honest youthful
plumpness about it her step was freer for the absence of her highheel
boots and even the hand she extended to Rand if not quite so small as
in her tight gloves and a little brown from exposure was magnetic in
its strong kindly grasp There was perhaps a slight suggestion of the
practical Mr Sol in her wholesome presence and Rand could not help
wondering if Mrs Sol had ever been a Gold Hill Pet before her
marriage with Mr Sol The young girl noticed his curious glance

You never saw me in my rehearsal dress before she said with a laugh
But Im not company today and didnt put on my best harness to
knock round in I suppose I look dreadful

I dont think you look bad said Rand simply

Thank you said Euphemia with a laugh and a courtesy But this isnt
getting the dinner

As part of that operation evidently was the takingoff of her hat
the puttingup of some thick blond locks that had escaped and the
rollingup of her sleeves over a pair of strong rounded arms Rand
lingered near her All trace of the Pets previous professional
coquetry was goneperhaps it was only replaced by a more natural one
but as she looked up and caught sight of Rands interested face she
laughed again and colored a little Slight as was the blush it was
sufficient to kindle a sympathetic fire in Rands own cheeks which was
so utterly unexpected to him that he turned on his heel in confusion I
reckon she thinks Im soft and silly like Ruth he soliloquized and
determining not to look at her again betook himself to a distant and
contemplative pipe In vain did Miss Euphemia address herself to the
ostentatious getting of the dinner in full view of him in vain did
she bring the coffeepot away from the fire and nearer Rand with the
apparent intention of examining its contents in a better light in vain
while wiping a plate did she absorbed in the distant prospect walk
to the verge of the mountain and become statuesque and forgetful The
sulky young gentleman took no outward notice of her

Mrs Sols attendance upon Mornie prevented her leaving the cabin and
Rand and Miss Euphemia dined in the open air alone The ridiculousness
of keeping up a formal attitude to his solitary companion caused Rand
to relax but to his astonishment the Pet seemed to have become
correspondingly distant and formal After a few moments of discomfort
Rand who had eaten little arose and believed he would go back to
work

Ah yes said the Pet with an indifferent air I suppose you must
Well goodby Mr Pinkney

Rand turned YOU are not going he asked in some uneasiness

IVE got some work to do too returned Miss Euphemia a little curtly

But said the practical Rand I thought you allowed that you were
fixed to stay until tomorrow

But here Miss Euphemia with rising color and slight acerbity of voice
was not aware that she was fixed to stay anywhere least of all when
she was in the way More than that she MUST sayalthough perhaps it
made no difference and she ought not to say itthat she was not in
the habit of intruding upon gentlemen who plainly gave her to understand
that her company was not desirable She did not know why she said
thisof course it could make no difference to anybody who didnt of
course carebut she only wanted to say that she only came here
because her dear friend her adopted motherand a better woman never
breathedhad come and had asked her to stay Of course Mrs Sol was
an intruder herselfMr Sol was an intruderthey were all intruders
she only wondered that Mr Pinkney had borne with them so long She knew
it was an awful thing to be here taking care of a poorpoor helpless
woman but perhaps Mr Rands BROTHER might forgive them if he
couldnt But no matter she would goMr Sol would goALL would go
and then perhaps Mr Rand

She stopped breathless she stopped with the corner of her apron against
her tearful hazel eyes she stopped withwhat was more remarkable than
allRands arm actually around her waist and his astonished alarmed
face within a few inches of her own

Why Miss Euphemia Phemie my dear girl I never meant anything like
THAT said Rand earnestly I really didnt now Come now

You never once spoke to me when I sat down said Miss Euphemia feebly
endeavoring to withdraw from Rands grasp

I really didnt Oh come now look here I didnt Dont Theres a
dearTHERE

This last conclusive exposition was a kiss Miss Euphemia was not quick
enough to release herself from his arms He anticipated that act a full
halfsecond and had dropped his own pale and breathless

The girl recovered herself first There I declare Im forgetting Mrs
Sols coffee she exclaimed hastily and snatching up the coffeepot
disappeared When she returned Rand was gone Miss Euphemia busied
herself demurely in clearing up the dishes with the tail of her
eye sweeping the horizon of the summit level around her But no Rand
appeared Presently she began to laugh quietly to herself This occurred
several times during her occupation which was somewhat prolonged The
result of this meditative hilarity was summed up in a somewhat grave
and thoughtful deduction as she walked slowly back to the cabin I do
believe Im the first woman that that boy ever kissed

Miss Euphemia staid that day and the next and Rand forgot his
embarrassment By what means I know not Miss Euphemia managed to
restore Rands confidence in himself and in her and in a little ramble
on the mountainside got him to relate albeit somewhat reluctantly the
particulars of his rescue of Mornie from her dangerous position on the
broken trail

And if you hadnt got there as soon as you did shed have fallen
asked the Pet

I reckon returned Rand gloomily she was sorter dazed and crazed
like

And you saved her life

I suppose so if you put it that way said Rand sulkily

But how did you get her up the mountain again

Oh I got her up returned Rand moodily

But how Really Mr Rand you dont know how interesting this is Its
as good as a play said the Pet with a little excited laugh

Oh I carried her up

In your arms

Yees

Miss Euphemia paused and bit off the stalk of a flower made a wry
face and threw it away from her in disgust

Then she dug a few tiny holes in the earth with her parasol and buried
bits of the flowerstalk in them as if they had been tender memories
I suppose you knew Mornie very well she asked

I used to run across her in the woods responded Rand shortly a year
ago I didnt know her so well then as He stopped

As what As NOW asked the Pet abruptly Rand who was coloring
over his narrow escape from a topic which a delicate kindness of Sol had
excluded from their intercourse on the mountain stammered as YOU do
I meant

The Pet tossed her head a little Oh I dont know her at allexcept
through Sol

Rand stared hard at this The Pet who was looking at him intently
said Show me the place where you saw Mornie clinging that night

Its dangerous suggested Rand

You mean Id be afraid Try me I dont believe she was SO dreadfully
frightened

Why asked Rand in astonishment

Ohbecause

Rand sat down in vague wonderment

Show it to me continued the Pet orIll find it ALONE

Thus challenged he rose and after a few moments climbing stood with
her upon the trail You see that thornbush where the rock has fallen
away It was just there It is not safe to go farther No really Miss
Euphemia Please dont Its almost certain death

But the giddy girl had darted past him and face to the wall of
the cliff was creeping along the dangerous path Rand followed
mechanically Once or twice the trail crumbled beneath her feet but
she clung to a projecting root of chaparral and laughed She had almost
reached her elected goal when slipping the treacherous chaparral she
clung to yielded in her grasp and Rand with a cry sprung forward

But the next instant she quickly transferred her hold to a cleft in
the cliff and was safe Not so her companion The soil beneath him
loosened by the impulse of his spring slipped away he was falling with
it when she caught him sharply with her disengaged hand and together
they scrambled to a more secure footing

I could have reached it alone said the Pet if youd left me
alone

Thank Heaven were saved said Rand gravely

AND WITHOUT A ROPE said Miss Euphemia significantly

Rand did not understand her But as they slowly returned to the summit
he stammered out the always difficult thanks of a man who has been
physically helped by one of the weaker sex Miss Euphemia was quick to
see her error

I might have made you lose your footing by catching at you she said
meekly But I was so frightened for you and could not help it

The superior animal thoroughly bamboozled thereupon complimented her
on her dexterity

Oh thats nothing she said with a sigh I used to do the
flyingtrapeze business with papa when I was a child and Ive not
forgotten it With this and other confidences of her early life in
which Rand betrayed considerable interest they beguiled the tedious
ascent I ought to have made you carry me up said the lady with a
little laugh when they reached the summit but you havent known me as
long as you have Mornie have you With this mysterious speech she bade
Rand goodnight and hurried off to the cabin

And so a week passed bythe week so dreaded by Rand yet passed so
pleasantly that at times it seemed as if that dread were only a trick
of his fancy or as if the circumstances that surrounded him were
different from what he believed them to be On the seventh day the
doctor had staid longer than usual and Rand who had been sitting with
Euphemia on the ledge by the shaft watching the sunset had barely
time to withdraw his hand from hers as Mrs Sol a trifle pale and
weariedlooking approached him

I dont like to trouble you she saidindeed they had seldom
troubled him with the details of Mornies convalescence or even her
needs and requirementsbut the doctor is alarmed about Mornie and
she has asked to see you I think youd better go in and speak to her
You know continued Mrs Sol delicately you havent been in there
since the night she was taken sick and maybe a new face might do her
good

The guilty blood flew to Rands face as he stammered I thought Id be
in the way I didnt believe she cared much to see me Is she worse

The doctor is looking very anxious said Mrs Sol simply

The blood returned from Rands face and settled around his heart He
turned very pale He had consoled himself always for his complicity
in Ruths absence that he was taking good care of Mornie orwhat
is considered by most selfish natures an equivalentpermitting or
encouraging some one else to take good care of her but here was
a contingency utterly unforeseen It did not occur to him that this
taking good care of her could result in anything but a perfect
solution of her troubles or that there could be any future to her
condition but one of recovery But what if she should die A sudden
and helpless sense of his responsibility to Ruth to HER brought him
trembling to his feet

He hurried to the cabin where Mrs Sol left him with a word of caution
Youll find her changed and quietvery quiet If I was you I
wouldnt say anything to bring back her old self

The change which Rand saw was so great the face that was turned to him
so quiet that with a new fear upon him he would have preferred the
savage eyes and reckless mien of the old Mornie whom he hated With his
habitual impulsiveness he tried to say something that should express
that fact not unkindly but faltered and awkwardly sank into the chair
by her bedside

I dont wonder you stare at me now she said in a faroff voice It
seems to you strange to see me lying here so quiet You are thinking how
wild I was when I came here that night I must have been crazy I think
I dreamed that I said dreadful things to you but you must forgive me
and not mind it I was crazy then She stopped and folded the blanket
between her thin fingers I didnt ask you to come here to tell you
that or to remind you of it butbut when I was crazy I said so many
worse dreadful things of HIM and youYOU will be left behind to tell
him of it

Rand was vaguely murmuring something to the effect that he knew she
didnt mean anything that she musnt think of it again that hed
forgotten all about it when she stopped him with a tired gesture

Perhaps I was wrong to think that after I am gone you would care to
tell him anything Perhaps Im wrong to think of it at all or to care
what he will think of me except for the sake of the childhis child
Randthat I must leave behind me He will know that IT never abused
him No God bless its sweet heart IT never was wild and wicked and
hateful like its cruel crazy mother And he will love it and you
perhaps will love it toojust a little Rand Look at it She tried
to raise the helpless bundle beside her in her arms but failed You
must lean over she said faintly to Rand It looks like him doesnt
it

Rand with wondering embarrassed eyes tried to see some resemblance
in the little bluered oval to the sad wistful face of his brother
which even then was haunting him from some mysterious distance He
kissed the childs forehead but even then so vaguely and perfunctorily
that the mother sighed and drew it closer to her breast

The doctor says she continued in a calmer voice that Im not doing
as well as I ought to I dont think she faltered with something of
her old bitter laugh that Im ever doing as well as I ought to and
perhaps its not strange now that I dont And he says that in case
anything happens to me I ought to look ahead I have looked ahead
Its a dark look ahead Randa horror of blackness without kind faces
without the baby withoutwithout HIM

She turned her face away and laid it on the bundle by her side It was
so quiet in the cabin that through the open door beyond the faint
rhythmical moan of the pines below was distinctly heard

I know its foolish but that is what looking ahead always meant to
me she said with a sigh But since the doctor has been gone Ive
talked to Mrs Sol and find its for the best And I look ahead and
see more clearly I look ahead and see my disgrace removed far away
from HIM and you I look ahead and see you and HE living together
happily as you did before I came between you I look ahead and see
my past life forgotten my faults forgiven and I think I see you both
loving my baby and perhaps loving me a little for its sake Thank you
Rand thank you

For Rands hand had caught hers beside the pillow and he was standing
over her whiter than she Something in the pressure of his hand
emboldened her to go on and even lent a certain strength to her voice

When it comes to THAT Rand youll not let these people take the baby
away Youll keep it HERE with you until HE comes And something tells
me that he will come when I am gone Youll keep it here in the pure air
and sunlight of the mountain and out of those wicked depths below and
when I am gone and they are gone and only you and Ruth and baby
are here maybe youll think that it came to you in a cloud on the
mountaina cloud that lingered only long enough to drop its burden
and faded leaving the sunlight and dew behind What is it Rand What
are you looking at

I was thinking said Rand in a strange altered voice that I must
trouble you to let me take down those duds and furbelows that hang on
the wall so that I can get at some traps of mine behind them He
took some articles from the wall replaced the dresses of Mrs Sol and
answered Mornies look of inquiry

I was only getting at my purse and my revolver he said showing them
Ive got to get some stores at the Ferry by daylight

Mornie sighed Im giving you great trouble Rand I know but it wont
be for long

He muttered something took her hand again and bade her goodnight
When he reached the door he looked back The light was shining full
upon her face as she lay there with her babe on her breast bravely
looking ahead


IV


THE CLOUDS PASS


It was early morning at the Ferry The up coach had passed with
lights unextinguished and the outsides still asleep The ferryman had
gone up to the Ferry Mansion House swinging his lantern and had found
the sleepylooking all night barkeeper on the point of withdrawing
for the day on a mattress under the bar An Indian halfbreed porter
of the Mansion House was washing out the stains of recent nocturnal
dissipation from the barroom and veranda a few birds were twittering
on the cottonwoods beside the river a bolder few had alighted upon
the veranda and were trying to reconcile the existence of so much
lemonpeel and cigarstumps with their ideas of a beneficent Creator
A faint earthly freshness and perfume rose along the river banks Deep
shadow still lay upon the opposite shore but in the distance four
miles away Morning along the level crest of Table Mountain walked with
rosy tread

The sleepy barkeeper was that morning doomed to disappointment for
scarcely had the coach passed when steps were heard upon the veranda
and a weary dusty traveller threw his blanket and knapsack to the
porter and then dropped into a vacant armchair with his eyes fixed
on the distant crest of Table Mountain He remained motionless for some
time until the barkeeper who had already concocted the conventional
welcome of the Mansion House appeared with it in a glass put it upon
the table glanced at the stranger and then thoroughly awake cried
out

Ruth Pinkneyor Im a Chinaman

The stranger lifted his eyes wearily Hollow circles were around their
orbits haggard lines were in his checks But it was Ruth

He took the glass and drained it at a single draught Yes he said
absently Ruth Pinkney and fixed his eyes again on the distant rosy
crest

On your way up home suggested the barkeeper following the direction
of Ruths eyes

Perhaps

Been upon a pasear haint yer Been havin a little tear round
Sacramentoseein the sights

Ruth smiled bitterly Yes

The barkeeper lingered ostentatiously wiping a glass But Ruth again
became abstracted in the mountain and the barkeeper turned away

How pure and clear that summit looked to him how restful and steadfast
with serenity and calm how unlike his own feverish dusty travelworn
self A week had elapsed since he had last looked upon ita week of
disappointment of anxious fears of doubts of wild imaginings of
utter helplessness In his hopeless quest of the missing Mornie he
had in fancy seen this serene eminence haunting his remorseful
passionstricken soul And now without a clew to guide him to her
unknown hidingplace he was back again to face the brother whom he had
deceived with only the confession of his own weakness Hard as it was
to lose forever the fierce reproachful glances of the woman he loved
it was still harder to a man of Ruths temperament to look again
upon the face of the brother he feared A hand laid upon his shoulder
startled him It was the barkeeper

If its a fair question Ruth Pinkney Id like to ask ye how long ye
kalkilate to hang around the Ferry today

Why demanded Ruth haughtily

Because whatever youve been and done I want ye to have a square
show Ole Nixon has been cavoortin round yer the last two days
swearin to kill you on sight for runnin off with his darter Sabe
Now let me ax ye two questions FIRST Are you heeled

Ruth responded to this dialectical inquiry affirmatively by putting his
hand on his revolver

Good Now SECOND Have you got the gal along here with you

No responded Ruth in a hollow voice

Thats better yet said the man without heeding the tone of
the reply A womanand especially THE woman in a row of this
kindhandicaps a man awful He paused and took up the empty glass
Look yer Ruth Pinkney Im a square man and Ill be square with you
So Ill just tell you youve got the demdest odds agin ye Praps ye
know it and dont keer Well the boys around yer are all sidin with
the old man Nixon Its the first time the old rip ever had a hand in
his favor so the boys will see fair play for Nixon and agin YOU But
I reckon you dont mind him

So little I shall never pull trigger on him said Ruth gravely

The barkeeper stared and rubbed his chin thoughtfully Well thars
that Kanaka Joe who used to be sorter sweet on Morniehes an ugly
devilhes helpin the old man

The sad look faded from Ruths eyes suddenly A certain wild Berserker
ragea taint of the blood inherited from heaven knows what OldWorld
ancestry which had made the twinbrothers Southwestern eccentricities
respected in the settlementglowed in its place The barkeeper noted
it and augured a lively future for the days festivities But it faded
again and Ruth as he rose turned hesitatingly towards him

Have you seen my brother Rand lately

Nary

He hasnt been here or about the Ferry

Nary time

You havent heard said Ruth with a faint attempt at a smile if
hes been around here asking after mesorter looking me up you know

Not much returned the barkeeper deliberately Ez far ez I know
Randthat ar brother o yourshes one of yer hightoned chaps ez
doesnt drink thinks barrooms is pizen and aint the sort to come
round yer and sling yarns with me

Ruth rose but the hand that he placed upon the table albeit a powerful
one trembled so that it was with difficulty he resumed his knapsack
When he did so his bent figure stooping shoulders and haggard face
made him appear another man from the one who had sat down There was a
slight touch of apologetic deference and humility in his manner as he
paid his reckoning and slowly and hesitatingly began to descend the
steps

The barkeeper looked after him thoughtfully Well dog my skin
he ejaculated to himself ef I hadnt seen that manthat same Ruth
Pinkneystraddle a friends body in this yer very room and dare a
whole crowd to come on Id swar that he hadnt any grit in him Thars
something up

But here Ruth reached the last step and turned again

If you see old man Nixon say Im in town if you see that 
 I regret to say that I cannot repeat his exact and brief
characterization of the present condition and natal antecedents of
Kanaka Joe say Im looking out for him and was gone

He wandered down the road towards the one long straggling street of
the settlement The few people who met him at that early hour greeted
him with a kind of constrained civility certain cautious souls hurried
by without seeing him all turned and looked after him and a few
followed him at a respectful distance A somewhat notorious practical
joker and recognized wag at the Ferry apparently awaited his coming with
something of invitation and expectation but catching sight of Ruths
haggard face and blazing eyes became instantly practical and by no
means jocular in his greeting At the top of the hill Ruth turned to
look once more upon the distant mountain now again a mere cloudline
on the horizon In the firm belief that he would never again see the sun
rise upon it he turned aside into a hazelthicket and tearing out a
few leaves from his pocketbook wrote two lettersone to Rand and
one to Mornie but which as they were never delivered shall not burden
this brief chronicle of that eventful day For while transcribing them
he was startled by the sounds of a dozen pistolshots in the direction
of the hotel he had recently quitted Something in the mere sound
provoked the old hereditary fighting instinct and sent him to his feet
with a bound and a slight distension of the nostrils and sniffing of
the air not unknown to certain men who become half intoxicated by
the smell of powder He quickly folded his letters and addressed
them carefully and taking off his knapsack and blanket methodically
arranged them under a tree with the letters on top Then he examined
the lock of his revolver and then with the step of a man ten years
younger leaped into the road He had scarcely done so when he was
seized and by sheer force dragged into a blacksmiths shop at the
roadside He turned his savage face and drawn weapon upon his assailant
but was surprised to meet the anxious eyes of the barkeeper of the
Mansion House

Dont be a dd fool said the man quickly Thars fifty agin you
down thar But why in hll didnt you wipe out old Nixon when you had
such a good chance

Wipe out old Nixon repeated Ruth

Yes just now when you had him covered

What

The barkeeper turned quickly upon Ruth stared at him and then
suddenly burst into a fit of laughter Well Ive knowed you two were
twins but damn me if I ever thought Id be sold like this And he
again burst into a roar of laughter

What do you mean demanded Ruth savagely

What do I mean returned the barkeeper Why I mean this I mean that
your brother Rand as you call him hez binfor a young feller and
a pious fellerdoin about the tallest kind o fightin today thats
been done at the Ferry He laid out that ar Kanaka Joe and two of his
chums He was pitched into on your quarrel and he took it up for you
like a little man I managed to drag him off up yer in the hazelbush
for safety and out you pops and I thought you was him He cant be
far away Halloo There theyre comin and thars the doctor trying to
keep them back

A crowd of angry excited faces filled the road suddenly but before
them Dr Duchesne mounted and with a pistol in his hand opposed their
further progress

Back in the bush whispered the barkeeper Nows your time

But Ruth stirred not Go you back he said in a low voice find Rand
and take him away I will fill his place here He drew his revolver
and stepped into the road

A shout a report and the spatter of red dust from a bullet near his
feet told him he was recognized He stirred not but another shout and
a cry There they areBOTH of em made him turn

His brother Rand with a smile on his lip and fire in his eye stood by
his side Neither spoke Then Rand quietly as of old slipped his hand
into his brothers strong palm Two or three bullets sang by them
a splinter flew from the blacksmiths shed but the brothers hard
gripping each others hands and looking into each others faces with a
quiet joy stood there calm and imperturbable

There was a momentary pause The voice of Dr Duchesne rose above the
crowd

Keep back I say keep back Or hear mefor five years Ive worked
among you and mended and patched the holes youve drilled through
each others carcassesKeep back I sayor the next man that pulls
trigger or steps forward will get a hole from me that no surgeon can
stop Im sick of your bungling ball practice Keep backor by the
living Jingo Ill show you where a mans vitals are

There was a burst of laughter from the crowd and for a moment the twins
were forgotten in this audacious speech and coolly impertinent presence

Thats right Now let that infernal old hypocritical drunkard Mat
Nixon step to the front

The crowd parted right and left and half pushed half dragged Nixon
before him

Gentlemen said the doctor this is the man who has just shot at Rand
Pinkney for hiding his daughter Now I tell you gentlemen and I tell
him that for the last week his daughter Mornie Nixon has been under
my care as a patient and my protection as a friend If theres anybody
to be shot the job must begin with me

There was another laugh and a cry of Bully for old Sawbones Ruth
started convulsively and Rand answered his look with a confirming
pressure of his hand

That isnt all gentlemen this drunken brute has just shot at a
gentleman whose only offence to my knowledge is that he has for the
last week treated her with a brothers kindness has taken her into his
own home and cared for her wants as if she were his own sister

Ruths hand again grasped his brothers Rand colored and hung his head

Theres more yet gentlemen I tell you that that girl Mornie Nixon
has to my knowledge been treated like a lady has been cared for as
she never was cared for in her fathers house and while that father
has been proclaiming her shame in every barroom at the Ferry has had
the sympathy and care night and day of two of the most accomplished
ladies of the FerryMrs Sol Saunders gentlemen and Miss Euphemia

There was a shout of approbation from the crowd Nixon would have
slipped away but the doctor stopped him

Not yet Ive one thing more to say Ive to tell you gentlemen on my
professional word of honor that besides being an old hypocrite this
same old Mat Nixon is the ungrateful unnatural GRANDFATHER of the first
boy born in the district

A wild huzza greeted the doctors climax By a common consent the crowd
turned toward the Twins who grasping each others hands stood apart
The doctor nodded his head The next moment the Twins were surrounded
and lifted in the arms of the laughing throng and borne in triumph to
the barroom of the Mansion House

Gentlemen said the barkeeper call for what you like the Mansion
House treats today in honor of its being the first time that Rand
Pinkney has been admitted to the bar



It was agreed that as her condition was still precarious the news
should be broken to her gradually and indirectly The indefatigable
Sol had a professional idea which was not displeasing to the Twins It
being a lovely summer afternoon the couch of Mornie was lifted out on
the ledge and she lay there basking in the sunlight drinking in the
pure air and looking bravely ahead in the daylight as she had in the
darkness for her couch commanded a view of the mountain flank And
lying there she dreamed a pleasant dream and in her dream saw Rand
returning up the mountaintrail She was half conscious that he had good
news for her and when he at last reached her bedside he began gently
and kindly to tell his news But she heard him not or rather in her
dream was most occupied with his ways and manners which seemed unlike
him yet inexpressibly sweet and tender The tears were fast coming in
her eyes when he suddenly dropped on his knees beside her threw away
Rands disguising hat and coat and clasped her in his arms And by that
she KNEW it was Ruth

But what they said what hurried words of mutual explanation and
forgiveness passed between them what bitter yet tender recollections
of hidden fears and doubts now forever chased away in the rain of tears
and joyous sunshine of that mountaintop were then whispered
whatever of this little chronicle that to the reader seems strange and
inconsistent as all human record must ever be strange and imperfect
except to the actors was then made clearwas never divulged by them
and must remain with them forever The rest of the party had withdrawn
and they were alone But when Mornie turned and placed the baby in its
fathers arms they were so isolated in their happiness that the lower
world beneath them might have swung and drifted away and left that
mountaintop the beginning and creation of a better planet



You know all about it now said Sol the next day explaining the
previous episodes of this history to Ruth youve got the whole plot
before you It dragged a little in the second act for the actors
werent up in their parts But for an amateur performance on the whole
it wasnt bad

I dont know Im sure said Rand impulsively how wed have got on
without Euphemia Its too bad she couldnt be here today

She wanted to come said Sol but the gentleman shes engaged to came
up from Marysville last night

Gentlemanengaged repeated Rand white and red by turns

Well yes I say gentleman although hes in the variety profession
She always said said Sol quietly looking at Rand that shed never
marry OUT of it




AN HEIRESS OF RED DOG


The first intimation given of the eccentricity of the testator was I
think in the spring of 1854 He was at that time in possession of a
considerable property heavily mortgaged to one friend and a wife of
some attraction on whose affections another friend held an encumbering
lien One day it was found that he had secretly dug or caused to be
dug a deep trap before the frontdoor of his dwelling into which a few
friends in the course of the evening casually and familiarly dropped
This circumstance slight in itself seemed to point to the existence of
a certain humor in the man which might eventually get into literature
although his wifes lovera man of quick discernment whose leg was
broken by the falltook other views It was some weeks later that
while dining with certain other friends of his wife he excused
himself from the table to quietly reappear at the frontwindow with a
threequarter inch hydraulic pipe and a stream of water projected at
the assembled company An attempt was made to take public cognizance of
this but a majority of the citizens of Red Dog who were not at dinner
decided that a man had a right to choose his own methods of diverting
his company Nevertheless there were some hints of his insanity his
wife recalled other acts clearly attributable to dementia the crippled
lover argued from his own experience that the integrity of her limbs
could only be secured by leaving her husbands house and the mortgagee
fearing a further damage to his property foreclosed But here the cause
of all this anxiety took matters into his own hands and disappeared

When we next heard from him he had in some mysterious way been
relieved alike of his wife and property and was living alone
at Rockville fifty miles away and editing a newspaper But that
originality he had displayed when dealing with the problems of his own
private life when applied to politics in the columns of The Rockville
Vanguard was singularly unsuccessful An amusing exaggeration
purporting to be an exact account of the manner in which the opposing
candidate had murdered his Chinese laundryman was I regret to
say answered only by assault and battery A gratuitous and purely
imaginative description of a great religious revival in Calaveras in
which the sheriff of the countya notoriously profane scepticwas
alleged to have been the chief exhorter resulted only in the withdrawal
of the county advertising from the paper In the midst of this practical
confusion he suddenly died It was then discovered as a crowning
proof of his absurdity that he had left a will bequeathing his entire
effects to a frecklefaced maidservant at the Rockville Hotel But that
absurdity became serious when it was also discovered that among these
effects were a thousand shares in the Rising Sun Mining Company which a
day or two after his demise and while people were still laughing at
his grotesque benefaction suddenly sprang into opulence and celebrity
Three millions of dollars was roughly estimated as the value of the
estate thus wantonly sacrificed For it is only fair to state as a
just tribute to the enterprise and energy of that young and thriving
settlement that there was not probably a single citizen who did not
feel himself better able to control the deceased humorists property
Some had expressed a doubt of their ability to support a family others
had felt perhaps too keenly the deep responsibility resting upon them
when chosen from the panel as jurors and had evaded their public
duties a few had declined office and a low salary but no one shrank
from the possibility of having been called upon to assume the functions
of Peggy Moffat the heiress

The will was contestedfirst by the widow who it now appeared had
never been legally divorced from the deceased next by four of his
cousins who awoke only too late to a consciousness of his moral
and pecuniary worth But the humble legateea singularly plain
unpretending uneducated Western girlexhibited a dogged pertinacity
in claiming her rights She rejected all compromises A rough sense of
justice in the community while doubting her ability to take care of the
whole fortune suggested that she ought to be content with three hundred
thousand dollars Shes bound to throw even THAT away on some derned
skunk of a man natoorally but three millions is too much to give a
chap for makin her onhappy Its offerin a temptation to cussedness
The only opposing voice to this counsel came from the sardonic lips of
Mr Jack Hamlin Suppose suggested that gentleman turning abruptly
on the speakersuppose when you won twenty thousand dollars of me
last Friday nightsuppose that instead of handing you over the money
as I didsuppose Id got up on my hindlegs and said Look yer Bill
Wethersbee youre a dd fool If I give ye that twenty thousand
youll throw it away in the first skingame in Frisco and hand it over
to the first shortcard sharp youll meet Theres a thousandenough
for you to fling awaytake it and get Suppose what Id said to you
was the frozen truth and you knowd it would that have been the square
thing to play on you But here Wethersbee quickly pointed out the
inefficiency of the comparison by stating that HE had won the money
fairly with a STAKE And how do you know demanded Hamlin savagely
bending his black eyes on the astounded casuisthow do you know that
the gal heznt put down a stake The man stammered an unintelligible
reply The gambler laid his white hand on Wethersbees shoulder Look
yer old man he said every gal stakes her WHOLE pileyou can bet
your life on thatwhatevers her little game If she took to keerds
instead of her feelings if shed put up chips instead o body and
soul shed bust every bank twixt this and Frisco You hear me

Somewhat of this idea was conveyed I fear not quite as sentimentally
to Peggy Moffat herself The best legal wisdom of San Francisco
retained by the widow and relatives took occasion in a private
interview with Peggy to point out that she stood in the quasicriminal
attitude of having unlawfully practised upon the affections of an insane
elderly gentleman with a view of getting possession of his property
and suggested to her that no vestige of her moral character would remain
after the trial if she persisted in forcing her claims to that issue
It is said that Peggy on hearing this stopped washing the plate she
had in her hands and twisting the towel around her fingers fixed her
small pale blue eyes at the lawyer

And ez that the kind o chirpin these critters keep up

I regret to say my dear young lady responded the lawyer that the
world is censorious I must add he continued with engaging frankness
that we professional lawyers are apt to study the opinion of the world
and that such will be the theory ofour side

Then said Peggy stoutly ez I allow Ive got to go into court to
defend my character I might as well pack in them three millions too

There is hearsay evidence that Peg added to this speech a wish and
desire to bust the crust of her traducers and remarking that that
was the kind of hairpin she was closed the conversation with an
unfortunate accident to the plate that left a severe contusion on the
legal brow of her companion But this story popular in the barrooms
and gulches lacked confirmation in higher circles Better authenticated
was the legend related of an interview with her own lawyer That
gentleman had pointed out to her the advantage of being able to show
some reasonable cause for the singular generosity of the testator

Although he continued the law does not go back of the will for
reason or cause for its provisions it would be a strong point with the
judge and juryparticularly if the theory of insanity were set upfor
us to show that the act was logical and natural Of course you haveI
speak confidently Miss Moffatcertain ideas of your own why the late
Mr Byways was so singularly generous to you

No I havent said Peg decidedly

Think again Had he not expressed to youyou understand that this is
confidential between us although I protest my dear young lady that
I see no reason why it should not be made publichad he not given
utterance to sentiments of a nature consistent with some future
matrimonial relations But here Miss Pegs large mouth which had been
slowly relaxing over her irregular teeth stopped him

If you mean he wanted to marry meNo

I see But were there any conditionsof course you know the law takes
no cognizance of any not expressed in the will but still for the sake
of mere corroboration of the bequestdo you know of any conditions on
which he gave you the property

You mean did he want anything in return

Exactly my dear young lady

Pegs face on one side turned a deep magenta color on the other a
lighter cherry while her nose was purple and her forehead an Indian
red To add to the effect of this awkward and discomposing dramatic
exhibition of embarrassment she began to wipe her hands on her dress
and sat silent

I understand said the lawyer hastily No matterthe conditions WERE
fulfilled

No said Peg amazedly How could they be until he was dead

It was the lawyers turn to color and grow embarrassed

He DID say something and make some conditions continued Peg with a
certain firmness through her awkwardness but thats nobodys business
but mine and hisn And its no call o yours or theirs

But my dear Miss Moffat if these very conditions were proofs of his
right mind you surely would not object to make them known if only to
enable you to put yourself in a condition to carry them out

But said Peg cunningly spose you and the Court didnt think em
satisfactory Spose you thought em QUEER Eh

With this helpless limitation on the part of the defence the case came
to trial Everybody remembers ithow for six weeks it was the daily
food of Calaveras County how for six weeks the intellectual and moral
and spiritual competency of Mr James Byways to dispose of his property
was discussed with learned and formal obscurity in the court and with
unlettered and independent prejudice by campfires and in barrooms At
the end of that time when it was logically established that at least
ninetenths of the population of Calaveras were harmless lunatics and
everybody elses reason seemed to totter on its throne an exhausted
jury succumbed one day to the presence of Peg in the courtroom It was
not a prepossessing presence at any time but the excitement and an
injudicious attempt to ornament herself brought her defects into a
glaring relief that was almost unreal Every freckle on her face
stood out and asserted itself singly her pale blue eyes that gave no
indication of her force of character were weak and wandering or
stared blankly at the judge her oversized head broad at the base
terminating in the scantiest possible lightcolored braid in the middle
of her narrow shoulders was as hard and uninteresting as the wooden
spheres that topped the railing against which she sat

The jury who for six weeks had had her described to them by the
plaintiffs as an arch wily enchantress who had sapped the failing
reason of Jim Byways revolted to a man There was something so
appallingly gratuitous in her plainness that it was felt that three
millions was scarcely a compensation for it Ef that money was give to
her she earned it SURE boys it wasnt no softness of the old man
said the foreman When the jury retired it was felt that she had
cleared her character when they reentered the room with their verdict
it was known that she had been awarded three millions damages for its
defamation

She got the money But those who had confidently expected to see
her squander it were disappointed on the contrary it was presently
whispered that she was exceedingly penurious That admirable woman Mrs
Stiver of Red Dog who accompanied her to San Francisco to assist her in
making purchases was loud in her indignation She cares more for two
bits than I do for five dollars She wouldnt buy anything at the City
of Paris because it was too expensive and at last rigged herself
out a perfect guy at some cheap slopshops in Market Street And after
all the care Jane and me took of her giving up our time and experience
to her she never so much as made Jane a single present Popular
opinion which regarded Mrs Stivers attention as purely speculative
was not shocked at this unprofitable denouement but when Peg refused to
give anything to clear the mortgage off the new Presbyterian Church and
even declined to take shares in the Union Ditch considered by many
as an equally sacred and safe investment she began to lose favor
Nevertheless she seemed to be as regardless of public opinion as she
had been before the trial took a small house in which she lived with
an old woman who had once been a fellowservant on apparently terms of
perfect equality and looked after her money I wish I could say that
she did this discreetly but the fact is she blundered The same dogged
persistency she had displayed in claiming her rights was visible in
her unsuccessful ventures She sunk two hundred thousand dollars in
a wornout shaft originally projected by the deceased testator she
prolonged the miserable existence of The Rockville Vanguard long after
it had ceased to interest even its enemies she kept the doors of
the Rockville Hotel open when its custom had departed she lost the
cooperation and favor of a fellowcapitalist through a trifling
misunderstanding in which she was derelict and impenitent she had three
lawsuits on her hands that could have been settled for a trifle I note
these defects to show that she was by no means a heroine I quote her
affair with Jack Folinsbee to show she was scarcely the average woman

That handsome graceless vagabond had struck the outskirts of Red Dog
in a cyclone of dissipation which left him a stranded but still rather
interesting wreck in a ruinous cabin not far from Peg Moffats virgin
bower Pale crippled from excesses with a voice quite tremulous from
sympathetic emotion more or less developed by stimulants he lingered
languidly with much time on his hands and only a few neighbors In
this fascinating kind of general deshabille of morals dress and the
emotions he appeared before Peg Moffat More than that he occasionally
limped with her through the settlement The critical eye of Red Dog took
in the singular pairJack voluble suffering apparently overcome by
remorse conscience vituperation and disease and Peg openmouthed
highcolored awkward yet delighted and the critical eye of Red Dog
seeing this winked meaningly at Rockville No one knew what passed
between them but all observed that one summer day Jack drove down the
main street of Red Dog in an open buggy with the heiress of that town
beside him Jack albeit a trifle shaky held the reins with something
of his old dash and Mistress Peggy in an enormous bonnet with
pearlcolored ribbons a shade darker than her hair holding in her
short pinkgloved fingers a bouquet of yellow roses absolutely glowed
crimson in distressful gratification over the dashboard So these two
fared on out of the busy settlement into the woods against the rosy
sunset Possibly it was not a pretty picture nevertheless as the dim
aisles of the solemn pines opened to receive them miners leaned upon
their spades and mechanics stopped in their toil to look after them
The critical eye of Red Dog perhaps from the sun perhaps from the
fact that it had itself once been young and dissipated took on a kindly
moisture as it gazed

The moon was high when they returned Those who had waited to
congratulate Jack on this near prospect of a favorable change in his
fortunes were chagrined to find that having seen the lady safe home
he had himself departed from Red Dog Nothing was to be gained from Peg
who on the next day and ensuing days kept the even tenor of her way
sunk a thousand or two more in unsuccessful speculation and made no
change in her habits of personal economy Weeks passed without any
apparent sequel to this romantic idyl Nothing was known definitely
until Jack a month later turned up in Sacramento with a billiardcue
in his hand and a heart overcharged with indignant emotion I dont
mind saying to you gentlemen in confidence said Jack to a circle of
sympathizing playersI dont mind telling you regarding this thing
that I was as soft on that freckledfaced redeyed tallowhaired gal
as if shed beenaaan actress And I dont mind saying gentlemen
that as far as I understand women she was just as soft on me You
kin laugh but its so One day I took her out buggyridingin style
tooand out on the road I offered to do the square thing just as if
shed been a ladyoffered to marry her then and there And what did
she do said Jack with a hysterical laugh Why blank it all OFFERED
ME TWENTYFIVE DOLLARS A WEEK ALLOWANCEPAY TO BE STOPPED WHEN I WASNT
AT HOME The roar of laughter that greeted this frank confession was
broken by a quiet voice asking And what did YOU saySay screamed
Jack I just told her to go to  with her moneyThey say
continued the quiet voice that you asked her for the loan of two
hundred and fifty dollars to get you to Sacramentoand that you got
itWho says so roared Jack Show me the blank liar There was a
dead silence Then the possessor of the quiet voice Mr Jack Hamlin
languidly reached under the table took the chalk and rubbing the end
of his billiardcue began with gentle gravity It was an old friend of
mine in Sacramento a man with a wooden leg a game eye three fingers
on his right hand and a consumptive cough Being unable naturally
to back himself he leaves things to me So for the sake of argument
continued Hamlin suddenly laying down his cue and fixing his wicked
black eyes on the speaker say its ME

I am afraid that this story whether truthful or not did not tend
to increase Pegs popularity in a community where recklessness and
generosity condoned for the absence of all the other virtues and it is
possible also that Red Dog was no more free from prejudice than other
more civilized but equally disappointed matchmakers Likewise during
the following year she made several more foolish ventures and lost
heavily In fact a feverish desire to increase her store at almost any
risk seemed to possess her At last it was announced that she intended
to reopen the infelix Rockville Hotel and keep it herself

Wild as this scheme appeared in theory when put into practical
operation there seemed to be some chance of success Much doubtless
was owing to her practical knowledge of hotelkeeping but more to
her rigid economy and untiring industry The mistress of millions
she cooked washed waited on table made the beds and labored like
a common menial Visitors were attracted by this novel spectacle The
income of the house increased as their respect for the hostess lessened
No anecdote of her avarice was too extravagant for current belief It
was even alleged that she had been known to carry the luggage of guests
to their rooms that she might anticipate the usual porters gratuity
She denied herself the ordinary necessaries of life She was poorly
clad she was illfedbut the hotel was making money

A few hinted of insanity others shook their heads and said a curse was
entailed on the property It was believed also from her appearance
that she could not long survive this tax on her energies and already
there was discussion as to the probable final disposition of her
property

It was the particular fortune of Mr Jack Hamlin to be able to set the
world right on this and other questions regarding her

A stormy December evening had set in when he chanced to be a guest of
the Rockville Hotel He had during the past week been engaged in the
prosecution of his noble profession at Red Dog and had in the graphic
language of a coadjutor cleared out the town except his fare in the
pockets of the stagedriver The Red Dog Standard had bewailed his
departure in playful obituary verse beginning Dearest Johnny thou
hast left us wherein the rhymes bereft us and deplore carried
a vague allusion to a thousand dollars more A quiet contentment
naturally suffused his personality and he was more than usually lazy
and deliberate in his speech At midnight when he was about to retire
he was a little surprised however by a tap on his door followed by
the presence of Mistress Peg Moffat heiress and landlady of Rockville
hotel

Mr Hamlin despite his previous defence of Peg had no liking for her
His fastidious taste rejected her uncomeliness his habits of thought
and life were all antagonistic to what he had heard of her niggardliness
and greed As she stood there in a dirty calico wrapper still redolent
with the days cuisine crimson with embarrassment and the recent heat
of the kitchen range she certainly was not an alluring apparition
Happily for the lateness of the hour her loneliness and the infelix
reputation of the man before her she was at least a safe one And I
fear the very consciousness of this scarcely relieved her embarrassment

I wanted to say a few words to ye alone Mr Hamlin she began taking
an unoffered seat on the end of his portmanteau or I shouldnt hev
intruded But its the only time I can ketch you or you me for Im
down in the kitchen from sunup till now

She stopped awkwardly as if to listen to the wind which was rattling
the windows and spreading a film of rain against the opaque darkness
without Then smoothing her wrapper over her knees she remarked as if
opening a desultory conversation Thars a power of rain outside

Mr Hamlins only response to this meteorological observation was a
yawn and a preliminary tug at his coat as he began to remove it

I thought ye couldnt mind doin me a favor continued Peg with a
hard awkward laugh partikly seein ez folks allowed youd sorter bin
a friend o mine and hed stood up for me at times when you hednt any
partikler call to do it I hevnt she continued looking down on her
lap and following with her finger and thumb a seam of her gownI
hevnt so many friends ez slings a kind word for me these times that
I disremember them Her under lip quivered a little here and after
vainly hunting for a forgotten handkerchief she finally lifted the hem
of her gown wiped her snub nose upon it but left the tears still in
her eyes as she raised them to the man Mr Hamlin who had by this time
divested himself of his coat stopped unbuttoning his waistcoat and
looked at her

Like ez not tharll be high water on the North Fork ef this rain keeps
on said Peg as if apologetically looking toward the window

The other rain having ceased Mr Hamlin began to unbutton his waistcoat
again

I wanted to ask ye a favor about MraboutJack Folinsbee began Peg
again hurriedly Hes ailin agin and is mighty low And hes losin
a heap o money here and thar and mostly to YOU You cleaned him out of
two thousand dollars last nightall he had

Well said the gambler coldly

Well I thought ez you woz a friend o mine Id ask ye to let up a
little on him said Peg with an affected laugh You kin do it Dont
let him play with ye

Mistress Margaret Moffat said Jack with lazy deliberation taking
off his watch and beginning to wind it up ef youre that much stuck
after Jack Folinsbee YOU kin keep him off of me much easier than I kin
Youre a rich woman Give him enough money to break my bank or break
himself for good and all but dont keep him forlin round me in hopes
to make a raise It dont pay Mistress Moffatit dont pay

A finer nature than Pegs would have misunderstood or resented the
gamblers slang and the miserable truths that underlaid it But she
comprehended him instantly and sat hopelessly silent

Ef youll take my advice continued Jack placing his watch and chain
under his pillow and quietly unloosing his cravat youll quit this
yer forlin marry that chap and hand over to him the money and the
moneymakin thats killin you Hell get rid of it soon enough I
dont say this because I expect to git it for when hes got that
much of a raise hell make a break for Frisco and lose it to some
firstclass sport THERE I dont say neither that you maynt be in
luck enough to reform him I dont say neitherand its a derned sight
more likelythat you maynt be luckier yet and hell up and die afore
he gits rid of your money But I do say youll make him happy NOW and
ez I reckon youre about ez badly stuck after that chap ez I ever saw
any woman you wont be hurtin your own feelins either

The blood left Pegs face as she looked up But thats WHY I cant give
him the moneyand he wont marry me without it

Mr Hamlins hand dropped from the last button of his waistcoat
Cantgivehimthemoney he repeated slowly

No

Why

Becausebecause I LOVE him

Mr Hamlin rebuttoned his waistcoat and sat down patiently on the bed
Peg arose and awkwardly drew the portmanteau a little nearer to him

When Jim Byways left me this yer property she began looking
cautiously around he left it to me on CONDITIONS not conditions ez
waz in his WRITTEN will but conditions ez waz SPOKEN A promise I made
him in this very room Mr Hamlinthis very room and on that very bed
youre sittin on in which he died

Like most gamblers Mr Hamlin was superstitious He rose hastily from
the bed and took a chair beside the window The wind shook it as if the
discontented spirit of Mr Byways were without reenforcing his last
injunction

I dont know if you remember him said Peg feverishly he was a man
ez hed suffered All that he lovedwife fammerly friendshad gone
back on him He tried to make light of it afore folks but with me
being a poor gal he let himself out I never told anybody this I dont
know why he told ME I dont know continued Peg with a sniffle why
he wanted to make me unhappy too But he made me promise that if he
left me his fortune Id NEVER NEVERso help me Godnever share it
with any man or woman that I LOVED I didnt think it would be hard to
keep that promise then Mr Hamlin for I was very poor and hednt a
friend nor a living bein that was kind to me but HIM

But youve as good as broken your promise already said Hamlin
Youve given Jack money as I know

Only what I made myself Listen to me Mr Hamlin When Jack proposed
to me I offered him about what I kalkilated I could earn myself When
he went away and was sick and in trouble I came here and took this
hotel I knew that by hard work I could make it pay Dont laugh at me
please I DID work hard and DID make it paywithout takin one cent of
the fortin And all I made workin by night and day I gave to him I
did Mr Hamlin I aint so hard to him as you think though I might be
kinder I know

Mr Hamlin rose deliberately resumed his coat watch hat and
overcoat When he was completely dressed again he turned to Peg Do
you mean to say that youve been givin all the money you made here to
this A 1 firstclass cherubim

Yes but he didnt know where I got it O Mr Hamlin he didnt know
that

Do I understand you that hes bin buckin agin Faro with the money that
you raised on hash And YOU makin the hash

But he didnt know that he wouldnt hev took it if Id told him

No hed hev died fust said Mr Hamlin gravely Why hes that
sensitiveis Jack Folinsbeethat it nearly kills him to take money
even of ME But where does this angel reside when he isnt fightin the
tiger and is so to speak visible to the naked eye

Hehestops here said Peg with an awkward blush

I see Might I ask the number of his roomor should I be adisturbing
him in his meditations continued Jack Hamlin with grave politeness

Oh then youll promise And youll talk to him and make HIM promise

Of course said Hamlin quietly

And youll remember hes sickvery sick His rooms No 44 at the end
of the hall Perhaps Id better go with you

Ill find it

And you wont be too hard on him

Ill be a father to him said Hamlin demurely as he opened the door
and stepped into the hall But he hesitated a moment and then turned
and gravely held out his hand Peg took it timidly He did not seem
quite in earnest and his black eyes vainly questioned indicated
nothing But he shook her hand warmly and the next moment was gone

He found the room with no difficulty A faint cough from within and
a querulous protest answered his knock Mr Hamlin entered without
further ceremony A sickening smell of drugs a palpable flavor of stale
dissipation and the wasted figure of Jack Folinsbee halfdressed
extended upon the bed greeted him Mr Hamlin was for an instant
startled There were hollow circles round the sick mans eyes there
was palsy in his trembling limbs there was dissolution in his feverish
breath

Whats up he asked huskily and nervously

I am and I want YOU to get up too

I cant Jack Im regularly done up He reached his shaking hand
towards a glass halffilled with suspicious pungentsmelling liquid
but Mr Hamlin stayed it

Do you want to get back that two thousand dollars you lost

Yes

Well get up and marry that woman down stairs

Folinsbee laughed half hysterically half sardonically

She wont give it to me

No but I will

YOU

Yes

Folinsbee with an attempt at a reckless laugh rose trembling and with
difficulty to his swollen feet Hamlin eyed him narrowly and then bade
him lie down again Tomorrow will do he said and then

If I dont

If you dont responded Hamlin why Ill just wade in and CUT YOU
OUT

But on the morrow Mr Hamlin was spared that possible act of disloyalty
for in the night the already hesitating spirit of Mr Jack Folinsbee
took flight on the wings of the southeast storm When or how it
happened nobody knew Whether this last excitement and the near
prospect of matrimony or whether an overdose of anodyne had hastened
his end was never known I only know that when they came to awaken
him the next morning the best that was left of hima face still
beautiful and boylikelooked up coldly at the tearful eyes of Peg
Moffat It serves me right its a judgment she said in a low whisper
to Jack Hamlin for God knew that Id broken my word and willed all my
property to him

She did not long survive him Whether Mr Hamlin ever clothed with
action the suggestion indicated in his speech to the lamented Jack that
night is not of record He was always her friend and on her demise
became her executor But the bulk of her property was left to a distant
relation of handsome Jack Folinsbee and so passed out of the control of
Red Dog forever




THE GREAT DEADWOOD MYSTERY


It was growing quite dark in the telegraphoffice at Cottonwood
Tuolumne County California The office a boxlike enclosure was
separated from the public room of the Miners Hotel by a thin partition
and the operator who was also news and express agent at Cottonwood
had closed his window and was lounging by his newsstand preparatory
to going home Without the first monotonous rain of the season was
dripping from the porches of the hotel in the waning light of a December
day The operator accustomed as he was to long intervals of idleness
was fast becoming bored

The tread of mudmuffled boots on the veranda and the entrance of two
men offered a momentary excitement He recognized in the strangers two
prominent citizens of Cottonwood and their manner bespoke business One
of them proceeded to the desk wrote a despatch and handed it to the
other interrogatively

Thats about the way the thing pints responded his companion
assentingly

I reckoned it only squar to use his dientical words

Thats so

The first speaker turned to the operator with the despatch

How soon can you shove her through

The operator glanced professionally over the address and the length of
the despatch

Now he answered promptly

And she gets there

Tonight But theres no delivery until tomorrow

Shove her through tonight and say theres an extra twenty left here
for delivery

The operator accustomed to all kinds of extravagant outlay for
expedition replied that he would lay this proposition with the
despatch before the San Francisco office He then took it and read
itand reread it He preserved the usual professional apathyhad
doubtless sent many more enigmatical and mysterious messagesbut
nevertheless when he finished he raised his eyes inquiringly to his
customer That gentleman who enjoyed a reputation for equal spontaneity
of temper and revolver met his gaze a little impatiently The operator
had recourse to a trick Under the pretence of misunderstanding the
message he obliged the sender to repeat it aloud for the sake of
accuracy and even suggested a few verbal alterations ostensibly
to insure correctness but really to extract further information
Nevertheless the man doggedly persisted in a literal transcript of his
message The operator went to his instrument hesitatingly

I suppose he added halfquestioningly there aint no chance of
a mistake This address is Rightbody that rich old Bostonian that
everybody knows There aint but one

Thats the address responded the first speaker coolly

Didnt know the old chap had investments out here suggested the
operator lingering at his instrument

No more did I was the insufficient reply

For some few moments nothing was heard but the click of the instrument
as the operator worked the key with the usual appearance of imparting
confidence to a somewhat reluctant hearer who preferred to talk himself
The two men stood by watching his motions with the usual awe of
the unprofessional When he had finished they laid before him two
goldpieces As the operator took them up he could not help saying

The old man went off kinder sudden didnt he Had no time to write

Not sudden for that kind o man was the exasperating reply

But the speaker was not to be disconcerted If there is an answer he
began

There aint any replied the first speaker quietly

Why

Because the man ez sent the message is dead

But its signed by you two

Ony ez witnesseseh appealed the first speaker to his comrade

Ony ez witnesses responded the other

The operator shrugged his shoulders The business concluded the first
speaker slightly relaxed He nodded to the operator and turned to the
barroom with a pleasing social impulse When their glasses were set
down empty the first speaker with a cheerful condemnation of the hard
times and the weather apparently dismissed all previous proceedings
from his mind and lounged out with his companion At the corner of the
street they stopped

Well that jobs done said the first speaker by way of relieving the
slight social embarrassment of parting

Thets so responded his companion and shook his hand

They parted A gust of wind swept through the pines and struck a faint
Aeolian cry from the wires above their heads and the rain and the
darkness again slowly settled upon Cottonwood

The message lagged a little at San Francisco laid over half an hour
at Chicago and fought longitude the whole way so that it was past
midnight when the all night operator took it from the wires at Boston
But it was freighted with a mandate from the San Francisco office and
a messenger was procured who sped with it through dark snowbound
streets between the high walls of closeshuttered rayless houses to
a certain formal square ghostly with snowcovered statues Here he
ascended the broad steps of a reserved and solidlooking mansion and
pulled a bronze bellknob that somewhere within those chaste recesses
after an apparent reflective pause coldly communicated the fact that a
stranger was waiting withoutas he ought Despite the lateness of the
hour there was a slight glow from the windows clearly not enough
to warm the messenger with indications of a festivity within but yet
bespeaking as it were some prolonged though subdued excitement The
sober servant who took the despatch and receipted for it as gravely as
if witnessing a last will and testament respectfully paused before
the entrance of the drawingroom The sound of measured and rhetorical
speech through which the occasional catarrhal cough of the NewEngland
coast struggled as the only effort of nature not wholly repressed came
from its heavilycurtained recesses for the occasion of the evening had
been the reception and entertainment of various distinguished persons
and as had been epigrammatically expressed by one of the guests the
history of the country was taking its leave in phrases more or less
memorable and characteristic Some of these valedictory axioms were
clever some witty a few profound but always left as a genteel
contribution to the entertainer Some had been already prepared and
like a card had served and identified the guest at other mansions

The last guest departed the last carriage rolled away when the servant
ventured to indicate the existence of the despatch to his master
who was standing on the hearthrug in an attitude of wearied
selfrighteousness He took it opened it read it reread it and
said

There must be some mistake It is not for me Call the boy Waters

Waters who was perfectly aware that the boy had left nevertheless
obediently walked towards the halldoor but was recalled by his master

No matterat present

Its nothing serious William asked Mrs Rightbody with languid
wifely concern

No nothing Is there a light in my study

Yes But before you go can you give me a moment or two

Mr Rightbody turned a little impatiently towards his wife She had
thrown herself languidly on the sofa her hair was slightly disarranged
and part of a slippered foot was visible She might have been a
finelyformed woman but even her careless deshabille left the general
impression that she was severely flannelled throughout and that any
ostentation of womanly charm was under vigorous sanitary SURVEILLANCE

Mrs Marvin told me tonight that her son made no secret of his serious
attachment for our Alice and that if I was satisfied Mr Marvin would
be glad to confer with you at once

The information did not seem to absorb Mr Rightbodys wandering
attention but rather increased his impatience He said hastily that he
would speak of that tomorrow and partly by way of reprisal and partly
to dismiss the subject added

Positively James must pay some attention to the register and the
thermometer It was over 70 degrees tonight and the ventilating
draught was closed in the drawingroom

That was because Professor Ammon sat near it and the old gentlemans
tonsils are so sensitive

He ought to know from Dr Dyer Doit that systematic and regular
exposure to draughts stimulates the mucous membrane while fixed air
over 60 degrees invariably

I am afraid William interrupted Mrs Rightbody with feminine
adroitness adopting her husbands topic with a view of thereby
directing him from itIm afraid that people do not yet appreciate
the substitution of bouillon for punch and ices I observed that Mr
Spondee declined it and I fancied looked disappointed The fibrine
and wheat in liqueurglasses passed quite unnoticed too

And yet each halfdrachm contained the halfdigested substance of
a pound of beef Im surprised at Spondee continued Mr Rightbody
aggrievedly Exhausting his brain and nerve force by the highest
creative efforts of the Muse he prefers perfumed and diluted alcohol
flavored with carbonic acid gas Even Mrs Faringway admitted to me
that the sudden lowering of the temperature of the stomach by the
introduction of ice

Yes but she took a lemon ice at the last Dorothea Reception and asked
me if I had observed that the lower animals refused their food at a
temperature over 60 degrees

Mr Rightbody again moved impatiently towards the door Mrs Rightbody
eyed him curiously

You will not write I hope Dr Keppler told me tonight that your
cerebral symptoms interdicted any prolonged mental strain

I must consult a few papers responded Mr Rightbody curtly as he
entered his library

It was a richlyfurnished apartment morbidly severe in its decorations
which were symptomatic of a gloomy dyspepsia of art then quite
prevalent A few curios very ugly but providentially equally rare
were scattered about There were various bronzes marbles and casts
all requiring explanation and so fulfilling their purpose of promoting
conversation and exhibiting the erudition of their owner There were
souvenirs of travel with a history old bricabrac with a pedigree
but little or nothing that challenged attention for itself alone In all
cases the superiority of the owner to his possessions was admitted As
a natural result nobody ever lingered there the servants avoided the
room and no child was ever known to play in it

Mr Rightbody turned up the gas and from a cabinet of drawers
precisely labelled drew a package of letters These he carefully
examined All were discolored and made dignified by age but some in
their original freshness must have appeared trifling and inconsistent
with any correspondent of Mr Rightbody Nevertheless that gentleman
spent some moments in carefully perusing them occasionally referring
to the telegram in his hand Suddenly there was a knock at the door
Mr Rightbody started made a halfunconscious movement to return the
letters to the drawer turned the telegram face downwards and then
somewhat harshly stammered

Eh Whos there Come in

I beg your pardon papa said a very pretty girl entering without
however the slightest trace of apology or awe in her manner and taking
a chair with the selfpossession and familiarity of an habitue of the
room but I knew it was not your habit to write late so I supposed you
were not busy I am on my way to bed

She was so very pretty and withal so utterly unconscious of it or
perhaps so consciously superior to it that one was provoked into a
more critical examination of her face But this only resulted in a
reiteration of her beauty and perhaps the added facts that her dark
eyes were very womanly her rich complexion eloquent and her chiselled
lips fell enough to be passionate or capricious notwithstanding that
their general effect suggested neither caprice womanly weakness nor
passion

With the instinct of an embarrassed man Mr Rightbody touched the topic
he would have preferred to avoid

I suppose we must talk over tomorrow he hesitated this matter of
yours and Mr Marvins Mrs Marvin has formally spoken to your mother

Miss Alice lifted her bright eyes intelligently but not joyfully
and the color of action rather than embarrassment rose to her round
cheeks

Yes HE said she would she answered simply

At present continued Mr Rightbody still awkwardly I see no
objection to the proposed arrangement

Miss Alice opened her round eyes at this

Why papa I thought it had been all settled long ago Mamma knew it
you knew it Last July mamma and you talked it over

Yes yes returned her father fumbling his papers that iswell we
will talk of it tomorrow In fact Mr Rightbody HAD intended to
give the affair a proper attitude of seriousness and solemnity by due
precision of speech and some apposite reflections when he should
impart the news to his daughter but felt himself unable to do it now
I am glad Alice he said at last that you have quite forgotten your
previous whims and fancies You see WE are right

Oh I dare say papa if Im to be married at all that Mr Marvin is
in every way suitable

Mr Rightbody looked at his daughter narrowly There was not the
slightest impatience nor bitterness in her manner it was as well
regulated as the sentiment she expressed

Mr Marvin is he began

I know what Mr Marvin IS interrupted Miss Alice and he has
promised me that I shall be allowed to go on with my studies the same as
before I shall graduate with my class and if I prefer to practise my
profession I can do so in two years after our marriage

In two years queried Mr Rightbody curiously

Yes You see in case we should have a child that would give me time
enough to wean it

Mr Rightbody looked at this flesh of his flesh pretty and palpable
flesh as it was but being confronted as equally with the brain of his
brain all he could do was to say meekly

Yes certainly We will see about all that tomorrow

Miss Alice rose Something in the free unfettered swing of her arms as
she rested them lightly after a half yawn on her lithe hips suggested
his next speech although still distrait and impatient

You continue your exercise with the healthlift yet I see

Yes papa but I had to give up the flannels I dont see how mamma
could wear them But my dresses are highnecked and by bathing I
toughen my skin See she added as with a childlike unconsciousness
she unfastened two or three buttons of her gown and exposed the white
surface of her throat and neck to her father I can defy a chill

Mr Rightbody with something akin to a genuine playful paternal laugh
leaned forward and kissed her forehead

Its getting late Ally he said parentally but not dictatorially
Go to bed

I took a nap of three hours this afternoon said Miss Alice with
a dazzling smile to anticipate this dissipation Goodnight papa
Tomorrow then

Tomorrow repeated Mr Rightbody with his eyes still fixed upon the
girl vaguely Goodnight

Miss Alice tripped from the room possibly a trifle the more
lightheartedly that she had parted from her father in one of his rare
moments of illogical human weakness And perhaps it was well for the
poor girl that she kept this single remembrance of him when I fear in
afteryears his methods his reasoning and indeed all he had tried to
impress upon her childhood had faded from her memory

For when she had left Mr Rightbody fell again to the examination of
his old letters This was quite absorbing so much so that he did not
notice the footsteps of Mrs Rightbody on the staircase as she passed
to her chamber nor that she had paused on the landing to look through
the glass halfdoor on her husband as he sat there with the letters
beside him and the telegram opened before him Had she waited a
moment later she would have seen him rise and walk to the sofa with a
disturbed air and a slight confusion so that on reaching it he seemed
to hesitate to lie down although pale and evidently faint Had she
still waited she would have seen him rise again with an agonized
effort stagger to the table fumblingly refold and replace the papers
in the cabinet and lock it and although now but halfconscious hold
the telegram over the gasflame till it was consumed

For had she waited until this moment she would have flown
unhesitatingly to his aid as this act completed he staggered again
reached his hand toward the bell but vainly and then fell prone upon
the sofa

But alas no providential nor accidental hand was raised to save him
or anticipate the progress of this story And when half an hour later
Mrs Rightbody a little alarmed and more indignant at his violation of
the doctors rules appeared upon the threshold Mr Rightbody lay upon
the sofa dead

With bustle with thronging feet with the irruption of strangers and
a hurrying to and fro but more than all with an impulse and emotion
unknown to the mansion when its owner was in life Mrs Rightbody
strove to call back the vanished life but in vain The highest medical
intelligence called from its bed at this strange hour saw only the
demonstration of its theories made a year before Mr Rightbody was
deadwithout doubt without mystery even as a correct man should
dielogically and indorsed by the highest medical authority

But even in the confusion Mrs Rightbody managed to speed a messenger
to the telegraphoffice for a copy of the despatch received by Mr
Rightbody but now missing

In the solitude of her own room and without a confidant she read these
words


 Copy

 To MR ADAMS RIGHTBODY BOSTON MASS

 Joshua Silsbie died suddenly this morning His last request was
 that you should remember your sacred compact with him of thirty
 years ago
 Signed SEVENTYFOUR
 SEVENTYFIVE


In the darkened home and amid the formal condolements of their friends
who had called to gaze upon the scarcely cold features of their late
associate Mrs Rightbody managed to send another despatch It was
addressed to SeventyFour and SeventyFive Cottonwood In a few hours
she received the following enigmatical response

A horsethief named Josh Silsbie was lynched yesterday morning by the
Vigilantes at Deadwood


PART II


The spring of 1874 was retarded in the California sierras so much so
that certain Eastern tourists who had early ventured into the Yo
Semite Valley found themselves one May morning snowbound against the
tempestuous shoulders of El Capitan So furious was the onset of the
wind at the Upper Merced Canyon that even so respectable a lady as Mrs
Rightbody was fain to cling to the neck of her guide to keep her seat
in the saddle while Miss Alice scorning all masculine assistance
was hurled a lovely chaos against the snowy wall of the chasm Mrs
Rightbody screamed Miss Alice raged under her breath but scrambled to
her feet again in silence

I told you so said Mrs Rightbody in an indignant whisper as
her daughter again ranged beside her I warned you especially
Alicethatthat

What interrupted Miss Alice curtly

That you would need your chemiloons and high boots said Mrs
Rightbody in a regretful undertone slightly increasing her distance
from the guides

Miss Alice shrugged her pretty shoulders scornfully but ignored her
mothers implication

You were particularly warned against going into the valley at this
season she only replied grimly

Mrs Rightbody raised her eyes impatiently

You know how anxious I was to discover your poor fathers strange
correspondent Alice You have no consideration

But when YOU HAVE discovered himwhat then queried Miss Alice

What then

Yes My belief is that you will find the telegram only a mere business
cipher and all this quest mere nonsense

Alice Why YOU yourself thought your fathers conduct that night very
strange Have you forgotten

The young lady had NOT but for some farreaching feminine reason
chose to ignore it at that moment when her late tumble in the snow was
still fresh in her mind

And this woman whoever she may be continued Mrs Rightbody

How do you know theres a woman in the case interrupted Miss Alice
wickedly I fear

How doIknowtheres a woman slowly ejaculated Mrs Rightbody
floundering in the snow and the unexpected possibility of such a
ridiculous question But here her guide flew to her assistance and
estopped further speech And indeed a grave problem was before them

The road that led to their single place of refugea cabin half hotel
half tradingpost scarce a mile awayskirted the base of the rocky
dome and passed perilously near the precipitous wall of the
valley There was a rapid descent of a hundred yards or more to
this terracelike passage and the guides paused for a moment of
consultation cooly oblivious alike to the terrified questioning of
Mrs Rightbody or the halfinsolent independence of the daughter The
elder guide was russetbearded stout and humorous the younger was
darkbearded slight and serious

Ef you kin git young Bunker Hill to let you tote her on your shoulders
Ill git the Madam to hang on to me came to Mrs Rightbodys horrified
ears as the expression of her particular companion

Freeze to the old gal and dont reckon on me if the daughter starts in
to play it alone was the enigmatical response of the younger guide

Miss Alice overheard both propositions and before the two men returned
to their side that highspirited young lady had urged her horse down
the declivity

Alas at this moment a gust of whirling snow swept down upon her There
was a flounder a misstep a fatal strain on the wrong rein a fall
a few plucky but unavailing struggles and both horse and rider slid
ignominiously down toward the rocky shelf Mrs Rightbody screamed
Miss Alice from a confused debris of snow and ice uplifted a vexed and
coloring face to the younger guide a little the more angrily perhaps
that she saw a shade of impatience on his face

Dont move but tie one end of the lass under your arms and throw me
the other he said quietly

What do you mean by lassthe lasso asked Miss Alice disgustedly

Yes maam

Then why dont you say so

O Alice reproachfully interpolated Mrs Rightbody encircled by the
elder guides stalwart arm

Miss Alice deigned no reply but drew the loop of the lasso over her
shoulders and let it drop to her round waist Then she essayed to
throw the other end to her guide Dismal failure The first fling nearly
knocked her off the ledge the second went all wild against the
rocky wall the third caught in a thornbush twenty feet below her
companions feet Miss Alices arm sunk helplessly to her side at which
signal of unqualified surrender the younger guide threw himself half
way down the slope worked his way to the thornbush hung for a moment
perilously over the parapet secured the lasso and then began to pull
away at his lovely burden Miss Alice was no dead weight however but
steadily halfscrambled on her hands and knees to within a foot or two
of her rescuer At this too familiar proximity she stood up and leaned
a little stiffly against the line causing the guide to give an extra
pull which had the lamentable effect of landing her almost in his arms

As it was her intelligent forehead struck his nose sharply and I
regret to add treating of a romantic situation caused that somewhat
prominent sign and token of a hero to bleed freely Miss Alice instantly
clapped a handful of snow over his nostrils

Now elevate your right arm she said commandingly

He did as he was bidden but sulkily

That compresses the artery

No man with a pretty womans hand and a handful of snow over his mouth
and nose could effectively utter a heroic sentence nor with his arm
elevated stiffly over his head assume a heroic attitude But when his
mouth was free again he said halfsulkily halfapologetically

I might have known a girl couldnt throw worth a cent

Why demanded Miss Alice sharply

Becausewhybecauseyou seethey havent got the experience he
stammered feebly

Nonsense they havent the CLAVICLEthats all Its because Im a
woman and smaller in the collarbone that I havent the play of the
forearm which you have See She squared her shoulders slightly and
turned the blaze of her dark eyes full on his Experience indeed A
girl can learn anything a boy can

Apprehension took the place of illhumor in her hearer He turned his
eyes hastily away and glanced above him The elder guide had gone
forward to catch Miss Alices horse which relieved of his rider was
floundering toward the trail Mrs Rightbody was nowhere to be seen And
these two were still twenty feet below the trail

There was an awkward pause

Shall I put you up the same way he queried Miss Alice looked at
his nose and hesitated Or will you take my hand he added in surly
impatience To his surprise Miss Alice took his hand and they began
the ascent together

But the way was difficult and dangerous Once or twice her feet slipped
on the smoothlyworn rock beneath and she confessed to an inward
thankfulness when her uncertain feminine handgrip was exchanged for his
strong arm around her waist Not that he was ungentle but Miss Alice
angrily felt that he had once or twice exercised his superior masculine
functions in a rough way and yet the next moment she would have
probably rejected the idea that she had even noticed it There was no
doubt however that he WAS a little surly

A fierce scramble finally brought them back in safety to the trail
but in the action Miss Alices shoulder striking a projecting bowlder
wrung from her a feminine cry of pain her first sign of womanly
weakness The guide stopped instantly

I am afraid I hurt you

She raised her brown lashes a trifle moist from suffering looked in
his eyes and dropped her own Why she could not tell And yet he had
certainly a kind face despite its seriousness and a fine face albeit
unshorn and weatherbeaten Her own eyes had never been so near to any
mans before save her lovers and yet she had never seen so much in
even his She slipped her hand away not with any reference to him
but rather to ponder over this singular experience and somehow felt
uncomfortable thereat

Nor was he less so It was but a few days ago that he had accepted the
charge of this young woman from the elder guide who was the recognized
escort of the Rightbody party having been a former correspondent of her
fathers He had been hired like any other guide but had undertaken
the task with that chivalrous enthusiasm which the average Californian
always extends to the sex so rare to him But the illusion had passed
and he had dropped into a sulky practical sense of his situation
perhaps fraught with less danger to himself Only when appealed to by
his manhood or her weakness he had forgotten his wounded vanity

He strode moodily ahead dutifully breaking the path for her in the
direction of the distant canyon where Mrs Rightbody and her friend
awaited them Miss Alice was first to speak In this trackless
uncharted terra incognita of the passions it is always the woman who
steps out to lead the way

You know this place very well I suppose you have lived here long

Yes

You were not born hereno

A long pause

I observe they call you Stanislaus Joe Of course that is not your
real name MemMiss Alice had never called him ANYTHING usually
prefacing any request with a languid Oerer please misterera
explicit enough for his station

No

Miss Alice trotting after him and bawling in his earWHAT name did
you say

The Man doggedlyI dont know Nevertheless when they reached the
cabin after an halfhours buffeting with the storm Miss Alice applied
herself to her mothers escort Mr Ryder

Whats the name of the man who takes care of my horse

Stanislaus Joe responded Mr Ryder

Is that all

No Sometimes hes called Joe Stanislaus

Miss Alice satiricallyI suppose its the custom here to send young
ladies out with gentlemen who hide their names under an alias

Mr Ryder greatly perplexedWhy dear me Miss Alice you allers
peared to me as a gal as was able to take keer

Miss Alice interrupting with a wounded dovelike timidityOh
never mind please

The cabin offered but scanty accommodation to the tourists which fact
when indignantly presented by Mrs Rightbody was explained by the
goodhumored Ryder from the circumstance that the usual hotel was only a
slight affair of boards cloth and paper put up during the season and
partly dismantled in the fall You couldnt be kept warm enough there
he added Nevertheless Miss Alice noticed that both Mr Ryder and
Stanislaus Joe retired there with their pipes after having prepared the
ladies supper with the assistance of an Indian woman who apparently
emerged from the earth at the coming of the party and disappeared as
mysteriously

The stars came out brightly before they slept and the next morning
a clear unwinking sun beamed with almost summer power through the
shutterless window of their cabin and ironically disclosed the details
of its rude interior Two or three mangy halfeaten buffalorobes
a bearskin some suspiciouslooking blankets rifles and saddles
dealtables and barrels made up its scant inventory A strip of faded
calico hung before a recess near the chimney but so blackened by
smoke and age that even feminine curiosity respected its secret Mrs
Rightbody was in high spirits and informed her daughter that she was at
last on the track of her husbands unknown correspondent SeventyFour
and SeventyFive represent two members of the Vigilance Committee my
dear and Mr Ryder will assist me to find them

Mr Ryder ejaculated Miss Alice in scornful astonishment

Alice said Mrs Rightbody with a suspicious assumption of sudden
defence you injure yourself you injure me by this exclusive
attitude Mr Ryder is a friend of your fathers an exceedingly
wellinformed gentleman I have not of course imparted to him the
extent of my suspicions But he can help me to what I must and will
know You might treat him a little more civillyor at least a little
better than you do his servant your guide Mr Ryder is a gentleman
and not a paid courier

Miss Alice was suddenly attentive When she spoke again she asked
Why do you not find out something about this Silsbiewho diedor was
hungor something of that kind

Child said Mrs Rightbody dont you see there was no Silsbie or
if there was he was simply the confidant of thatwoman

A knock at the door announcing the presence of Mr Ryder and Stanislaus
Joe with the horses checked Mrs Rightbodys speech As the animals
were being packed Mrs Rightbody for a moment withdrew in confidential
conversation with Mr Ryder and to the young ladys still greater
annoyance left her alone with Stanislaus Joe Miss Alice was not in
good temper but she felt it necessary to say something

I hope the hotel offers better quarters for travellers than this in
summer she began

It does

Then this does not belong to it

No maam

Who lives here then

I do

I beg your pardon stammered Miss Alice I thought you lived where we
hiredwhere we met youininYou must excuse me

Im not a regular guide but as times were hard and I was out of grub
I took the job

Out of grub job And SHE was the job What would Henry Marvin
say It would nearly kill him She began herself to feel a little
frightened and walked towards the door

One moment miss

The young girl hesitated The mans tone was surly and yet indicated a
certain kind of halfpathetic grievance HER curiosity got the better of
her prudence and she turned back

This morning he began hastily when we were coming down the valley
you picked me up twice

I picked YOU up repeated the astonished Alice

Yes CONTRADICTED me thats what I meanonce when you said those
rocks were volcanic once when you said the flower you picked was a
poppy I didnt let on at the time for it wasnt my say but all the
while you were talking I might have laid for you

I dont understand you said Alice haughtily

I might have entrapped you before folks But I only want you to know
that IM right and here are the books to show it

He drew aside the dingy calico curtain revealed a small shelf of
bulky books took down two large volumesone of botany one
of geologynervously sought his text and put them in Alices
outstretched hands

I had no intention she began halfproudly halfembarrassedly

Am I right miss he interrupted

I presume you are if you say so

Thats all maam Thank you

Before the girl had time to reply he was gone When he again returned
it was with her horse and Mrs Rightbody and Ryder were awaiting her
But Miss Alice noticed that his own horse was missing

Are you not going with us she asked

No maam

Oh indeed

Miss Alice felt her speech was a feeble conventionalism but it was all
she could say She however DID something Hitherto it had been her
habit to systematically reject his assistance in mounting to her seat
Now she awaited him As he approached she smiled and put out her
little foot He instantly stooped she placed it in his hand rose
with a spring and for one supreme moment Stanislaus Joe held her
unresistingly in his arms The next moment she was in the saddle but
in that brief interval of sixty seconds she had uttered a volume in a
single sentence

I hope you will forgive me

He muttered a reply and turned his face aside quickly as if to hide it

Miss Alice cantered forward with a smile but pulled her hat down over
her eyes as she joined her mother She was blushing


PART III


Mr Ryder was as good as his word A day or two later he entered Mrs
Rightbodys parlor at the Chrysopolis Hotel in Stockton with the
information that he had seen the mysterious senders of the despatch and
that they were now in the office of the hotel waiting her pleasure Mr
Ryder further informed her that these gentlemen had only stipulated that
they should not reveal their real names and that they be introduced to
her simply as the respective SeventyFour and SeventyFive who had
signed the despatch sent to the late Mr Rightbody

Mrs Rightbody at first demurred to this but on the assurance from Mr
Ryder that this was the only condition on which an interview would be
granted finally consented

You will find them square men even if they are a little rough maam
But if youd like me to be present Ill stop though I reckon if
yed calkilated on that youd have had me take care o your business by
proxy and not come yourself three thousand miles to do it

Mrs Rightbody believed it better to see them alone

All right maam Ill hang round out here and ef ye should happen to
have a ticklin in your throat and a bad spell o coughin Ill drop
in careless like to see if you dont want them drops Sabe

And with an exceedingly arch wink and a slight familiar tap on Mrs
Rightbodys shoulder which might have caused the late Mr Rightbody to
burst his sepulchre he withdrew

A very timid hesitating tap on the door was followed by the entrance of
two men both of whom in general size strength and uncouthness
were ludicrously inconsistent with their diffident announcement
They proceeded in Indian file to the centre of the room faced Mrs
Rightbody acknowledged her deep courtesy by a strong shake of the hand
and drawing two chairs opposite to her sat down side by side

I presume I have the pleasure of addressing began Mrs Rightbody

The man directly opposite Mrs Rightbody turned to the other
inquiringly

The other man nodded his head and replied

SeventyFour

SeventyFive promptly followed the other

Mrs Rightbody paused a little confused

I have sent for you she began again to learn something more of
the circumstances under which you gentlemen sent a despatch to my late
husband

The circumstances replied SeventyFour quietly with a sideglance at
his companion panned out about in this yer style We hung a man named
Josh Silsbie down at Deadwood for hossstealin When I say WE I
speak for SeventyFive yer as is present as well as representin so to
speak seventytwo other gents as is scattered We hung Josh Silsbie on
squar pretty squar evidence Afore he was strung up SeventyFive yer
axed him accordin to custom ef ther was enny thing he had to say
or enny request that he allowed to make of us He turns to SeventyFive
yer and

Here he paused suddenly looking at his companion

He sez sez he began SeventyFive taking up the narrativehe sez
Kin I write a letter sez he Sez I Not much ole man yeve got
no time Sez he Kin I send a despatch by telegraph I sez Heave
ahead He sezthese is his dientikal wordsSend to Adam Rightbody
Boston Tell him to remember his sacred compack with me thirty years
ago

His sacred compack with me thirty years ago echoed
SeventyFourhis dientikal words

What was the compact asked Mrs Rightbody anxiously

SeventyFour looked at SeventyFive and then both arose and retired
to the corner of the parlor where they engaged in a slow but whispered
deliberation Presently they returned and sat down again

We allow said SeventyFour quietly but decidedly that YOU know
what that sacred compact was

Mrs Rightbody lost her temper and her truthfulness together Of
course she said hurriedly I know But do you mean to say that you
gave this poor man no further chance to explain before you murdered
him

SeventyFour and SeventyFive both rose again slowly and retired
When they returned again and sat down SeventyFive who by this time
through some subtile magnetism Mrs Rightbody began to recognize as the
superior power said gravely

We wish to say regarding this yer murder that SeventyFour and me
is equally responsible that we reckon also to represent so to
speak seventytwo other gentlemen as is scattered that we are ready
SeventyFour and me to take and holt that responsibility now and at
any time afore every man or men as kin be fetched agin us We wish to
say that this yer say of ours holds good yer in Californy or in any
part of these United States

Or in Canady suggested SeventyFour

Or in Canady We wouldnt agree to cross the water or go to furrin
parts unless absolutely necessary We leaves the chise of weppings to
your principal maam or being a lady maam and interested to
any one you may fetch to act for him An advertisement in any of the
Sacramento papers or a playcard or handbill stuck unto a tree near
Deadwood saying that SeventyFour or SeventyFive will communicate with
this yer principal or agent of yours will fetch usallers

Mrs Rightbody a little alarmed and desperate saw her blunder I mean
nothing of the kind she said hastily I only expected that you might
have some further details of this interview with Silsbie that perhaps
you could tell me a bold bright thought crossed Mrs Rightbodys
mindsomething more about HER

The two men looked at each other

I suppose your society have no objection to giving me information about
HER said Mrs Rightbody eagerly

Another quiet conversation in the corner and the return of both men

We want to say that weve no objection

Mrs Rightbodys heart beat high Her boldness had made her penetration
good Yet she felt she must not alarm the men heedlessly

Will you inform me to what extent Mr Rightbody my late husband was
interested in her

This time it seemed an age to Mrs Rightbody before the men returned
from their solemn consultation in the corner She could both hear
and feel that their discussion was more animated than their previous
conferences She was a little mortified however when they sat down to
hear SeventyFour say slowly

We wish to say that we dont allow to say HOW much

Do you not think that the sacred compact between Mr Rightbody and
Mr Silsbie referred to her

We reckon it do

Mrs Rightbody flushed and animated would have given worlds had her
daughter been present to hear this undoubted confirmation of her theory
Yet she felt a little nervous and uncomfortable even on this threshold
of discovery

Is she here now

Shes in Tuolumne said SeventyFour

A little better looked arter than formerly added SeventyFive

I see Then Mr Silsbie ENTICED her away

Well maam it WAS allowed as she runned away But it wasnt proved
and it generally wasnt her style

Mrs Rightbody trifled with her next question

She was pretty of course

The eyes of both men brightened

She was THAT said SeventyFour emphatically

It would have done you good to see her added SeventyFive

Mrs Rightbody inwardly doubted it but before she could ask another
question the two men again retired to the corner for consultation When
they came back there was a shade more of kindliness and confidence in
their manner and SeventyFour opened his mind more freely

We wish to say maam looking at the thing by and large in a
farminded way that ez YOU seem interested and ez Mr Rightbody was
interested and was according to all accounts deceived and led away by
Silsbie that we dont mind listening to any proposition YOU might make
as a ladyallowin you was ekally interested

I understand said Mrs Rightbody quickly And you will furnish me
with any papers

The two men again consulted

We wish to say maam that we think shes got papers but

I MUST have them you understand interrupted Mrs Rightbody at any
price

We was about to say maam said SeventyFour slowly that
considerin all thingsand you being a ladyyou kin have HER papers
pedigree and guaranty for twelve hundred dollars

It has been alleged that Mrs Rightbody asked only one question more
and then fainted It is known however that by the next day it
was understood in Deadwood that Mrs Rightbody had confessed to the
Vigilance Committee that her husband a celebrated Boston millionaire
anxious to gain possession of Abner Springers wellknown sorrel mare
had incited the unfortunate Josh Silsbie to steal it and that finally
failing in this the widow of the deceased Boston millionaire was now in
personal negotiation with the owners

Howbeit Miss Alice returning home that afternoon found her mother
with a violent headache

We will leave here by the next steamer said Mrs Rightbody languidly
Mr Ryder has promised to accompany us

But mother

The climate Alice is overrated My nerves are already suffering
from it The associations are unfit for you and Mr Marvin is naturally
impatient

Miss Alice colored slightly

But your quest mother

Ive abandoned it

But I have not said Alice quietly Do you remember my guide at the
Yo SemiteStanislaus Joe Well Stanislaus Joe iswho do you think

Mrs Rightbody was languidly indifferent

Well Stanislaus Joe is the son of Joshua Silsbie

Mrs Rightbody sat upright in astonishment

Yes But mother he knows nothing of what we know His father treated
him shamefully and set him cruelly adrift years ago and when he was
hung the poor fellow in sheer disgrace changed his name

But if he knows nothing of his fathers compact of what interest is
this

Oh nothing Only I thought it might lead to something

Mrs Rightbody suspected that something and asked sharply And pray
how did YOU find it out You did not speak of it in the valley

Oh I didnt find it out till today said Miss Alice walking to the
window He happened to be here andtold me


PART IV


If Mrs Rightbodys friends had been astounded by her singular and
unexpected pilgrimage to California so soon after her husbands decease
they were still more astounded by the information a year later that
she was engaged to be married to a Mr Ryder of whom only the scant
history was known that he was a Californian and former correspondent
of her husband It was undeniable that the man was wealthy and
evidently no mere adventurer it was rumored that he was courageous and
manly but even those who delighted in his odd humor were shocked at his
grammar and slang

It was said that Mr Marvin had but one interview with his fatherinlaw
elect and returned so supremely disgusted that the match was broken
off The horsestealing story more or less garbled found its way
through lips that pretended to decry it yet eagerly repeated it Only
one member of the Rightbody familyand a new onesaved them from utter
ostracism It was young Mr Ryder the adopted son of the prospective
head of the household whose culture manners and general elegance
fascinated and thrilled Boston with a new sensation It seemed to many
that Miss Alice should in the vicinity of this rare exotic forget her
former enthusiasm for a professional life but the young man was pitied
by society and various plans for diverting him from any mesalliance
with the Rightbody family were concocted

It was a wintry night and the second anniversary of Mr Rightbodys
death that a light was burning in his library But the dead mans chair
was occupied by young Mr Ryder adopted son of the new proprietor of
the mansion and before him stood Alice with her dark eyes fixed on the
table

There must have been something in it Joe believe me Did you never
hear your father speak of mine

Never

But you say he was collegebred and born a gentleman and in his youth
he must have had many friends

Alice said the young man gravely when I have done something to
redeem my name and wear it again before these people before YOU it
would be well to revive the past But till then

But Alice was not to be put down I remember she went on scarcely
heeding him that when I came in that night papa was reading a
letter and seemed to be disconcerted

A letter

Yes but added Alice with a sigh when we found him here
insensible there was no letter on his person He must have destroyed
it

Did you ever look among his papers If found it might be a clew

The young man glanced toward the cabinet Alice read his eyes and
answered

Oh dear no The cabinet contained only his papers all perfectly
arrangedyou know how methodical were his habitsand some old
business and private letters all carefully put away

Let us see them said the young man rising

They opened drawer after drawer files upon files of letters and
business papers accurately folded and filed Suddenly Alice uttered a
little cry and picked up a quaint ivory paperknife lying at the bottom
of a drawer

It was missing the next day and never could be found he must have
mislaid it here This is the drawer said Alice eagerly

Here was a clew But the lower part of the drawer was filled with
old letters not labelled yet neatly arranged in files Suddenly he
stopped and said Put them back Alice at once

Why

Some of these letters are in my fathers handwriting

The more reason why I should see them said the girl imperatively
Here you take part and Ill take part and well get through
quicker

There was a certain decision and independence in her manner which he had
learned to respect He took the letters and in silence read them
with her They were old college letters so filled with boyish dreams
ambitions aspirations and utopian theories that I fear neither of
these young people even recognized their parents in the dead ashes of
the past They were both grave until Alice uttered a little hysterical
cry and dropped her face in her hands Joe was instantly beside her

Its nothing Joe nothing Dont read it please please dont Its
so funny its so very queer

But Joe had after a slight halfplayful struggle taken the letter
from the girl Then he read aloud the words written by his father thirty
years ago

I thank you dear friend for all you say about my wife and boy I
thank you for reminding me of our boyish compact He will be ready
to fulfil it I know if he loves those his father loves even if you
should marry years later I am glad for your sake for both our sakes
that it is a boy Heaven send you a good wife dear Adams and a
daughter to make my son equally happy

Joe Silsbie looked down took the halflaughing halftearful face in
his hands kissed her forehead and with tears in his grave eyes said
Amen



I am inclined to think that this sentiment was echoed heartily by Mrs
Rightbodys former acquaintances when a year later Miss Alice was
united to a professional gentleman of honor and renown yet who was
known to be the son of a convicted horsethief A few remembered the
previous Californian story and found corroboration therefor but a
majority believed it a just reward to Miss Alice for her conduct to Mr
Marvin and as Miss Alice cheerfully accepted it in that light I do
not see why I may not end my story with happiness to all concerned



A LEGEND OF SAMMTSTADT


It was the sacred hour of noon at Sammtstadt Everybody was at dinner
and the serious Kellner of Der Wildemann glanced in mild reproach at
Mr James Clinch who disregarding that fact and the invitatory
table dhote stepped into the street For Mr Clinch had eaten a
late breakfast at Gladbach was dyspeptic and American and moveover
preoccupied with business He was consequently indignant on entering
the gardenlike court and cloisterlike countinghouse of Von Becheret
Sons Uncles and Cousins to find the comptoir deserted even by the
porter and was furious at the maidservant who offered the sacred
shibboleth Mittagsessen as a reasonable explanation of the solitude
A country said Mr Clinch to himself that stops business at midday
to go to dinner and employs womenservants to talk to businessmen is
played out

He stepped from the silent building into the equally silent Kronprinzen
Strasse Not a soul to be seen anywhere Rows on rows of twostoried
graystuccoed buildings that might be dwellings or might be offices
all showing some traces of feminine taste and supervision in a flower
or a curtain that belied the legended Comptoir or Direction over
their portals Mr Clinch thought of Boston and State Street of New
York and Wall Street and became coldly contemptuous

Yet there was clearly nothing to do but to walk down the formal rows of
chestnuts that lined the broad Strasse and then walk back again At the
corner of the first crossstreet he was struck with the fact that two
men who were standing in front of a dwellinghouse appeared to be as
inconsistent and out of proportion to the silent houses as were the
actors on a stage to the painted canvas thoroughfares before which they
strutted Mr Clinch usually had no fancies had no eye for quaintness
besides this was not a quaint nor romantic district only an entrepot
for silks and velvets and Mr Clinch was here not as a tourist but as
a purchaser The guidebooks had ignored Sammtstadt and he was too
good an American to waste time in looking up uncatalogued curiosities
Besides he had been here once beforean entire day

One oclock Still a full hour and a half before his friend would
return to business What should he do The Verein where he had once
been entertained was deserted even by its waiters the garden with its
ostentatious outofdoor tables looked bleak and bare Mr Clinch was
not artistic in his tastes but even he was quick to detect the affront
put upon Nature by this continental theatrical gardening and turned
disgustedly away Born near a lake larger than the German Ocean
he resented a pool of water twentyfive feet in diameter under that
alluring title and a frequenter of the Adirondacks he could scarce
contain himself over a bit of rockwork twelve feet high A country
said Mr Clinch that but here he remembered that he had once seen
in a park in his native city an imitation of the Drachenfels in plaster
on a scale of two inches to the foot and checked his speech

He turned into the principal allee of the town There was a long white
building at one endthe Bahnhof at the other end he remembered a
dyehouse He had a year ago met its hospitable proprietor he would
call upon him now

But the same solitude confronted him as he passed the porters lodge
beside the gateway The countinghouse half villa half factory must
have convoked its humanity in some outoftheway refectory for the
halls and passages were tenantless For the first time he began to be
impressed with a certain foreign quaintness in the surroundings he
found himself also recalling something he had read when a boy about
an enchanted palace whose inhabitants awoke on the arrival of
a longpredestined Prince To assure himself of the absolute
ridiculousness of this fancy he took from his pocket the businesscard
of its proprietor a sample of dye and recalled his own personality in
a letter of credit Having dismissed this idea from his mind he lounged
on again through a rustic lane that might have led to a farmhouse yet
was still absurdly enough a part of the factory gardens Crossing
a ditch by a causeway he presently came to another ditch and another
causeway and then found himself idly contemplating a massive ivyclad
venerable brick wall As a mere wall it might not have attracted his
attention but it seemed to enter and bury itself at right angles in the
sidewall of a quite modernlooking dwelling After satisfying himself
of this fact he passed on before the dwelling but was amazed to see
the wall reappear on the other side exactly the sameold ivygrown
sturdy uncompromising and ridiculous

Could it actually be a part of the house He turned back and repassed
the front of the building The entrance door was hospitably open There
was a hall and a staircase butby all that was preposterousthey
were built OVER and AROUND the central brick intrusion The wall
actually ran through the house A country said Mr Clinch to himself
where they build their houses over ruins to accommodate them or save
the trouble of removal is but a very pleasant voice addressing him
here stopped his usual hasty conclusion

Guten Morgen

Mr Clinch looked hastily up Leaning on the parapet of what appeared
to be a garden on the roof of the house was a young girl redcheeked
brighteyed blondhaired The voice was soft subdued and mellow it
was part of the new impression he was receiving that it seemed to be
in some sort connected with the ivyclad wall before him His hat was in
his hand as he answered

Guten Morgen

Was the Herr seeking anything

The Herr was only waiting a longtimecoming friend and had strayed
here to speak with the beforeknown proprietor

So But the beforeknown proprietor sleeping well at present after
dinner would the Herr on the terrace still a while linger

The Herr would but looked around in vain for the means to do it He
was thinking of a scalingladder when the young woman reappeared at the
open door and bade him enter

Following the youthful hostess Mr Clinch mounted the staircase but
passing the mysterious wall could not forbear an allusion to it It is
old very old said the girl it was here when I came

That was not very long ago said Mr Clinch gallantly

No but my grandfather found it here too

And built over it

Why not It is very very hard and SO thick

Mr Clinch here explained with masculine superiority the existence of
such modern agents as nitroglycerine and dynamite persuasive in their
effects upon timehonored obstructions and encumbrances

But there was not then what you callthisninitroglycerine

But since then

The young girl gazed at him in troubled surprise My greatgrandfather
did not take it away when he built the house why should we

Oh

They had passed through a hall and diningroom and suddenly stepped
out of a window upon a gravelled terrace From this a few stone steps
descended to another terrace on which trees and shrubs were growing
and yet looking over the parapet Mr Clinch could see the road some
twenty feet below It was nearly on a level with and part of the
second story of the house Had an earthquake lifted the adjacent
ground or had the house burrowed into a hill Mr Clinch turned to his
companion who was standing close beside him breathing quite audibly
and leaving an impression on his senses as of a gentle and fragrant
heifer

How was all this done

The maiden did not know It was always here

Mr Clinch reascended the steps He had quite forgotten his impatience
Possibly it was the gentle equable calm of the girl who but for her
ready color did not seem to be moved by anything perhaps it was the
peaceful repose of this mausoleum of the dead and forgotten wall that
subdued him but he was quite willing to take the oldfashioned chair
on the terrace which she offered him and follow her motions with not
altogether mechanical eyes as she drew out certain bottles and glasses
from a mysterious closet in the wall Mr Clinch had the weakness of a
majority of his sex in believing that he was a good judge of wine and
women The latter as shown in the specimen before him he would have
invoiced as a fair sample of the middleclass German womanhealthy
comfortloving homeabiding the very genius of domesticity Even in
her virgin outlines the future wholesome matron was already forecast
from the curves of her broad hips to the flat lines of her back and
shoulders Of the wine he was to judge later THAT required an even more
subtle and unimpassioned intellect

She placed two bottles before him on the tableone the traditional
longnecked ambercolored Rheinflasche the other an old quaint
discolored amphoraxpatterned glass jug The first she opened

This she said pointing to the other cannot be opened

Mr Clinch paid his respects first to the opened bottle a good quality
of Niersteiner With his intellect thus clarified he glanced at the
other

It is from my greatgrandfather It is old as the wall

Mr Clinch examined the bottle attentively It seemed to have no cork
Formed of some obsolete opaque glass its twisted neck was apparently
hermetically sealed by the same material The maiden smiled as she
said

It cannot be opened now without breaking the bottle It is not good
luck to do so My grandfather and my father would not

But Mr Clinch was still examining the bottle Its neck was flattened
towards the mouth but a close inspection showed it was closed by some
equally hard cement but not glass

If I can open it without breaking the bottle have I your permission

A mischievous glance rested on Mr Clinch as the maiden answered

I shall not object but for what will you do it

To taste it to try it

You are not afraid

There was just enough obvious admiration of Mr Clinchs audacity in the
maidens manner to impel him to any risk His only answer was to take
from his pocket a small steel instrument Holding the neck of the bottle
firmly in one hand he passed his thumb and the steel twice or thrice
around it A faint rasping scratching sound was all the wondering girl
heard Then with a sudden dexterous twist of his thumb and finger to
her utter astonishment he laid the top of the neck neatly cut off in
her hand

Theres a better and more modern bottle than you had before he said
pointing to the cleanlydivided neck and any cork will fit it now

But the girl regarded him with anxiety And you still wish to taste the
wine

With your permission yes

He looked up in her eyes There was permission there was something
more that was flattering to his vanity He took the wineglass and
slowly and in silence filled it from the mysterious flask

The wine fell into the glass clearly transparently heavily but
still and cold as death There was no sparkle no cheap ebullition
no evanescent bubble Yet it was so clear that but for a faint
ambertinting the glass seemed empty There was no aroma no ethereal
diffusion from its equable surface Perhaps it was fancy perhaps it was
from nervous excitement but a slight chill seemed to radiate from the
still goblet and bring down the temperature of the terrace Mr Clinch
and his companion both insensibly shivered

But only for a moment Mr Clinch raised the glass to his lips As he
did so he remembered seeing distinctly as in a picture before him the
sunlit terrace the pretty girl in the foregroundan amused spectator
of his sacrilegious actthe outlying ivycrowned wall the grassgrown
ditch the tall factory chimneys rising above the chestnuts and the
distant poplars that marked the Rhine

The wine was delicious perhaps a TRIFLE only a trifle heady He was
conscious of a slight exaltation There was also a smile upon the girls
lip and a roguish twinkle in her eye as she looked at him

Do you find the wine to your taste she asked

Fair enough I warrant said Mr Clinch with ponderous gallantry but
methinks tis nothing compared with the nectar that grows on those ruby
lips Nay by St Ursula I swear it

No sooner had this solemnly ridiculous speech passed the lips of the
unfortunate man than he would have given worlds to have recalled it He
knew that he must be intoxicated that the sentiment and language were
utterly unlike him he was miserably aware that he did not even know
exactly what it meant he was also hopelessly conscious Yet feeling all
thisfeeling too the shame of appearing before her as a man who had
lost his senses through a single glass of winenevertheless he rose
awkwardly seized her hand and by sheer force drew her towards him and
kissed her With an exclamation that was half a cry and half a laugh
she fled from him leaving him alone and bewildered on the terrace

For a moment Mr Clinch supported himself against the open window
leaning his throbbing head on the cold glass Shame mortification an
hysterical halfconsciousness of his utter ridiculousness and yet an
odd undefined terror of something by turns possessed him Was he ever
before guilty of such perfect folly Had he ever before made such a
spectacle of himself Was it possible that he Mr James Clinch the
coolest head at a late supperhe the American who had repeatedly
drunk Frenchmen and Englishmen under the tablecould be transformed
into a sentimental stagey idiot by a single glass of wine He was
conscious too of asking himself these very questions in a stilted sort
of rhetoric and with a rising brutality of anger that was new to
him And then everything swam before him and he seemed to lose all
consciousness

But only for an instant With a strong effort of his will he again
recalled himself his situation his surroundings and above all his
appointment He rose to his feet hurriedly descended the terracesteps
and before he well knew how found himself again on the road Once
there his faculties returned in full vigor he was again himself
He strode briskly forward toward the ditch he had crossed only a few
moments before but was suddenly stopped It was filled with water He
looked up and down It was clearly the same ditch but a flowing stream
thirty feet wide now separated him from the other bank

The appearance of this unlookedfor obstacle made Mr Clinch doubt the
full restoration of his faculties He stepped to the brink of the flood
to bathe his head in the stream and wash away the last vestiges of his
potations But as he approached the placid depths and knelt down he
again started back and this time with a full conviction of his own
madness for reflected from its mirrorlike surface was a figure he
could scarcely call his own although here and there some trace of his
former self remained

His closecropped hair trimmed a la mode had given way to long
curling locks that dropped upon his shoulders His neat mustache was
frightfully prolonged and curled up at the ends stiffly His Piccadilly
collar had changed shape and texture and reacheda mass of laceto a
point midway of his breast His bootswhy had he not noticed his boots
beforethese triumphs of his Parisian bootmaker were lost in hideous
leathern cases that reached half way up his thighs In place of his
former high silk hat there lay upon the ground beside him the awful
thing he had just taken offa mass of thickened felt flap feather
and buckle that weighed at least a stone

A single terrible idea now took possession of him He had been sold
taken in done for He saw it all In a state of intoxication he
had lost his way had been dragged into some vile den stripped of his
clothes and valuables and turned adrift upon the quiet town in this
shameless masquerade How should he keep his appointment how inform
the police of this outrage upon a stranger and an American citizen how
establish his identity Had they spared his papers He felt feverishly
in his breast Ahhis watch Yes a watchheavy jewelled
enamelledand by all that was ridiculous FIVE OTHERS He ran his
hands into his capacious trunk hose What was this Brooches chains
fingerringsone large episcopal oneearrings and a handful
of battered gold and silver coins His papers his memorandums his
passportall proofs of his identitywere gone In their place was the
unmistakable omnium gatherum of an accomplished knight of the road Not
only was his personality but his character gone forever

It was a part of Mr Clinchs singular experience that this last stroke
of ill fortune seemed to revive in him something of the brutal instinct
he had felt a moment before He turned eagerly about with the intention
of calling some onethe first person he metto account But the house
that he had just quitted was gone The wall Ah there it was no
longer purposeless intrusive and ivyclad but part of the buttress
of another massive wall that rose into battlements above him Mr Clinch
turned again hopelessly toward Sammtstadt There was the fringe of
poplars on the Rhine there were the outlying fields lit by the same
meridian sun but the characteristic chimneys of Sammtstadt were gone
Mr Clinch was hopelessly lost

The sound of a horn breaking the stillness recalled his senses He now
for the first time perceived that a little distance below him partly
hidden in the trees was a queer towershaped structure with chains
and pulleys that in some strange way recalled his boyish reading
A drawbridge and portcullis And on the battlement a figure in a
masquerading dress as absurd as his own flourishing a banner and
trumpet and trying to attract his attention

Was wollen Sie

I want to see the proprietor said Mr Clinch choking back his rage

There was a pause and the figure turned apparently to consult with
some one behind the battlements After a moment he reappeared and in a
perfunctory monotone with an occasional breathing spell on the trumpet
began

You do give warranty as a good knight and true as well as by the bones
of the blessed St Ursula that you bear no ill will secret enmity
wicked misprise or conspiracy against the body of our noble lord
and master Von Kolnsche And you bring with you no ambush siege or
surprise of retainers neither secret warrant nor lettres de cachet nor
carry on your knightly person poisoned dagger magic ring witchpowder
nor enchanted bullet and that you have entered into no unhallowed
alliance with the Prince of Darkness gnomes hexies dragons Undines
Loreleis nor the like

Come down out of that you dd old fool roared Mr Clinch now
perfectly beside himself with ragecome down and let me in

As Mr Clinch shouted out the last words confused cries of recognition
and welcome not unmixed with some consternation rose from the
battlements Ach Gott Mutter Gottit is he It is Jann Der
Wanderer It is himself The chains rattled the ponderous drawbridge
creaked and dropped and across it a medley of motley figures rushed
pellmell But foremost among them the very maiden whom he had left not
ten minutes before flew into his arms and with a cry of joyful greeting
sank upon his breast Mr Clinch looked down upon the fair head and long
braids It certainly was the same maiden his cruel enchantress but
where did she get those absurd garments

Willkommen said a stout figure advancing with some authority and
seizing his disengaged hand where hast thou been so long

Mr Clinch by no means placated coldly dropped the extended hand
It was NOT the proprietor he had known But there was a singular
resemblance in his face to some one of Mr Clinchs own kin but who
he could not remember May I take the liberty of asking your name he
asked coldly

The figure grinned Surely but if thou standest upon punctilio it
is for ME to ask thine most noble Freiherr said he winking upon his
retainers Whom have I the honor of entertaining

My name is ClinchJames Clinch of Chicago Ill

A shout of laughter followed In the midst of his rage and mortification
Mr Clinch fancied he saw a shade of pain and annoyance flit across the
face of the maiden He was puzzled but pressed her hand in spite of
his late experiences reassuringly She made a gesture of silence to
him and then slipped away in the crowd

Schames Klnsche von Schekargo mimicked the figure to the
unspeakable delight of his retainers So THAT is the latest French
style Holy St Ursula Hark ye nephew I am not a travelled man Since
the Crusades we simple Rhine gentlemen have staid at home But I call
myself Kolnsche of Koln at your service

Very likely you are right said Mr Clinch hotly disregarding the
caution of his fair companion but whoever YOU are I am a stranger
entitled to protection I have been robbed

If Mr Clinch had uttered an exquisite joke instead of a very angry
statement it could not have been more hilariously received He paused
grew confused and then went on hesitatingly

In place of my papers and credentials I find only these And he
produced the jewelry from his pockets

Another shout of laughter and clapping of hands followed this second
speech and the baron with a wink at his retainers prolonged the
general mirth by saying By the way nephew there is little doubt but
there has been robberysomewhere

It was done continued Mr Clinch hurrying to make an end of his
explanation while I was inadvertently overcome with liquordrugged
liquor

The laughter here was so uproarious that the baron albeit with tears
of laughter in his own eyes made a peremptory gesture of silence The
gesture was peculiar to the baron efficacious and simple It consisted
merely in knocking down the nearest laugher Having thus restored
tranquillity he strode forward and took Mr Clinch by the hand By
St Adolph I did doubt thee a moment ago nephew but this last frank
confession of thine shows me I did thee wrong Willkommen zu Hause
Jann drunk or sober willcommen zu Cracowen

More and more mystified but convinced of the folly of any further
explanation Mr Clinch took the extended hand of his alleged uncle and
permitted himself to be led into the castle They passed into a large
banquetinghall adorned with armor and implements of the chase Mr
Clinch could not help noticing that although the appointments were
liberal and picturesque the ventilation was bad and the smoke from the
huge chimney made the air murky The oaken tables massive in carving
and rich in color were unmistakably greasy and Mr Clinch slipped on
a piece of meat that one of the dozen halfwild dogs who were occupying
the room was tearing on the floor The dog yelping ran between the
legs of a retainer precipitating him upon the baron who instantly
with the equal foot of fate kicked him and the dog into a corner

And whence came you last asked the baron disregarding the little
contretemps and throwing himself heavily on an oaken settle while
he pushed a queer uncomfortablelooking stool with legs like a
Siamesetwinconnected double X towards his companion

Mr Clinch who had quite given himself up to fate answered
mechanically

Paris

The baron winked his eye with unutterable elderly wickedness Ach
Gott it is nothing to what it was when I was your age Ah there was
ManonSieur Manon we used to call her I suppose shes getting old
now How goes on the feud between the students and the citizens Eh Did
you go to the bal in la Cite

Mr Clinch stopped the flow of those JusticeShallowlike reminiscences
by an uneasy exclamation He was thinking of the maiden who had
disappeared so suddenly The baron misinterpreted his nervousness What
ho within thereMax Wolfganglazy rascals Bring some wine

At the baleful word Mr Clinch started to his feet Not for me Bring
me none of your bodyandsouldestroying poison Ive enough of it

The baron stared The servitors stared also

I beg your pardon said Mr Clinch recalling himself slowly but I
fear that Rhine wine does not agree with me

The baron grinned Perceiving however that the three servitors grinned
also he kicked two of them into obscurity and felled the third to
the floor with his fist Hark ye nephew he said turning to the
astonished Clinch give over this nonsense By the mitre of Bishop
Hatto thou art as big a fool as he

Hatto repeated Clinch mechanically What he of the Mouse Tower

Ay of the Mouse Tower sneered the baron I see you know the story

Why am I like him asked Mr Clinch in amazement

The baron grinned HE punished the Rhenish wine as thou dost without
judgment He had

The jimjams said Mr Clinch mechanically again

The baron frowned I know not what gibberish thou sayest by jimjams
but he had like thee the wildest fantasies and imaginings saw snakes
toads rats in his boots but principally rats said they pursued him
came to his room his bedach Gott

Oh said Mr Clinch with a sudden return to his firmer self and his
native inquiring habits then THAT is the fact about Bishop Hatto of
the story

His enemies made it the subject of a vile slander of an old friend of
mine said the baron and those cursed poets who believe everything
and then persuade others to do somay the Devil fly away with
themkept it up

Here were facts quite to Mr Clinchs sceptical mind He forgot himself
and his surroundings

And that story of the Drachenfels he asked insinuatinglythe
dragon you know Was he too

The baron grinned A boar transformed by the drunken brains of the
Bauers of the Siebengebirge Ach Gott Ottefried had many a hearty laugh
over it and it did him as thou knowest good service with the nervous
mother of the silly maiden

And the seven sisters of Schonberg asked Mr Clinch persuasively

Schonberg Seven sisters What of them demanded the baron sharply

Why you knowthe maidens who were so coy to their suitors
anddont you rememberjumped into the Rhine to avoid them

Coy Jumped into the Rhine to avoid suitors roared the baron
purple with rage Hark ye nephew I like not this jesting Thou
knowest I married one of the Schonberg girls as did thy father How
coy they were is neither here nor there but mayhap WE might tell
another story Thy father as weak a fellow as thou art where a
petticoat is concerned could not as a gentleman do other than he did
And THIS is his reward Ach Gott Coy And THIS I warrant is the way
the story is delivered in Paris

Mr Clinch would have answered that this was the way he read it in a
guidebook but checked himself at the hopelessness of the explanation
Besides he was on the eve of historic information he was as it were
interviewing the past and whether he would ever be able to profit by
the opportunity or not he could not bear to lose it And how about the
Loreleiis she too a fiction he asked glibly

It was said observed the baron sardonically that when thou
disappeared with the gamekeepers daughter at ObercasselHeaven knows
wherethou wast swallowed up in a whirlpool with some creature Ach
Gott I believe it But a truce to this balderdash And so thou wantest
to know of the coy sisters of Schoenberg Hark ye Jann that cousin
of thine is a Schonberg Call you her coy Did I not see thy greeting
Eh By St Adolph knowing thee as she does to be robber and thief call
you her greeting coy

Furious as Mr Clinch inwardly became under these epithets he felt that
his explanation would hardly relieve the maiden from deceit or himself
from weakness But out of his very perplexity and turmoil a bright idea
was born He turned to the baron

Then you have no faith in the Rhine legends

The baron only replied with a contemptuous shrug of his shoulders

But what if I told you a new one

You

Yes a part of my experience

The baron was curious It was early in the afternoon just after dinner
He might be worse bored

Ive only one condition added Mr Clinch the young ladyI mean of
course my cousinmust hear it too

Oh ay I see Of coursethe old trick Well call the jade But mark
ye Sir Nephew no enchanted maidens and knights Keep to thyself Be as
thou art vagabond Jann Kolnische knight of the roadWhat ho there
scoundrels Call the Lady Wilhemina

It was the first time Mr Clinch had heard his fair friends name but
it was not evidently the first time she had seen him as the very
decided wink the gentle maiden dropped him testified Nevertheless
with hands lightly clasped together and downcast eyes she stood before
them

Mr Clinch began Without heeding the barons scornful grin he
graphically described his meeting two years before with a Lorelei her
usual pressing invitation and his subsequent plunge into the Rhine

I am free to confess added Mr Clinch with an affecting glance to
Wilhelmina that I was not enamoured of the graces of the lady but was
actuated by my desire to travel and explore hitherto unknown regions I
wished to travel to visit

Paris interrupted the baron sarcastically

America continued Mr Clinch

WhatAmerica

Tis a gnomelike sounding name this Meriker Go on nephew tell us
of Meriker

With the characteristic fluency of his nation Mr Clinch described his
landing on those enchanted shores viz the Rhine Whirlpool and Hell
Gate East River New York He described the railways tramways
telegraphs hotels phonograph and telephone An occasional oath broke
from the baron but he listened attentively and in a few moments Mr
Clinch had the raconteurs satisfaction of seeing the vast hall slowly
filling with openeyed and openmouthed retainers hanging upon his
words Mr Clinch went on to describe his astonishment at meeting on
these very shores some of his own blood and kin In fact said Mr
Clinch here were a race calling themselves Clinch but all claiming
to have descended from Kolnische

And how sneered the baron

Through James Kolnische and Wilhelmina his wife returned Mr Clinch
boldly They emigrated from Koln and Crefeld to Philadelphia where
there is a quarter named Crefeld Mr Clinch felt himself shaky as to
his chronology but wisely remembered that it was a chronology of the
future to his hearers and they could not detect an anachronism With
his eyes fixed upon those of the gentle Wilhelmina Mr Clinch now
proceeded to describe his return to his fatherland but his astonishment
at finding the very face of the country changed and a city standing
on those fields he had played in as a boy and how he had wandered
hopelessly on until he at last sat wearily down in a humble cottage
built upon the ruins of a lordly castle So utterly travelworn and
weak had I become said Mr Clinch with adroitly simulated pathos
that a single glass of wine offered me by the simple cottage maiden
affected me like a prolonged debauch

A longdrawn snore was all that followed this affecting climax The
baron was asleep the retainers were also asleep Only one pair of eyes
remained openarch luminous blueWilhelminas

There is a subterranean passage below us to Linn Let us fly she
whispered

But why

They always do it in the legends she murmured modestly

But your father

He sleeps Do you not hear him

Certainly somebody was snoring But oddly enough it seemed to be
Wilhelmina Mr Clinch suggested this to her

Fool it is yourself

Mr Clinch struck with the idea stopped to consider She was right It
certainly WAS himself

With a struggle he awoke The sun was shining The maiden was looking at
him But the castlethe castle was gone

You have slept well said the maiden archly Everybody does after
dinner at Sammtstadt Father has just awakened and is coming

Mr Clinch stared at the maiden at the terrace at the sky at the
distant chimneys of Sammtstadt at the more distant Rhine at the table
before him and finally at the empty glass The maiden smiled Tell
me said Mr Clinch looking in her eyes is there a secret passage
underground between this place and the Castle of Linn

An underground passage

Aywhence the daughter of the house fled with a stranger knight

They say there is said the maiden with a gentle blush

Can you show it to me

She hesitated Papa is coming Ill ask him

I presume she did At least the Herr Consul at Sammtstadt informs me of
a marriagecertificate issued to one Clinch of Chicago and Kolnische of
Koln and there is an amusing story extant in the Verein at Sammtstadt
of an American connoisseur of Rhine wines who mistook a flask of Cognac
and rockcandy used for craftily qualifying lower grades of wine to
the American standard for the rarest Rudesheimerberg




VIEWS FROM A GERMAN SPION


Outside of my window two narrow perpendicular mirrors parallel
with the casement project into the street yet with a certain
unobtrusiveness of angle that enables them to reflect the people who
pass without any reciprocal disclosure of their own The men and women
hurrying by not only do not know they are observed but what is worse
do not even see their own reflection in this hypocritical plane and
are consequently unable through its aid to correct any carelessness
of garb gait or demeanor At first this seems to be taking an unfair
advantage of the human animal who invariably assumes an attitude
when he is conscious of being under human focus But I observe that my
neighbors windows right and left have a similar apparatus that this
custom is evidently a local one and the locality is German Being
an American stranger I am quite willing to leave the morality of the
transaction with the locality and adapt myself to the custom indeed
I had thought of offering it figuratively as an excuse for any
unfairness of observation I might make in these pages But my German
mirrors reflect without prejudice selection or comment and the
American eye I fear is but mortal and like all mortal eyes
figuratively as well as in that literal fact noted by an eminent
scientific authority infinitely inferior to the work of the best German
opticians

And this leads me to my first observation namely that a majority of
those who pass my mirror have weak eyes and have already invoked the
aid of the optician Why are these people physically in all else so
much stronger than my countrymen deficient in eyesight Or to omit the
passing testimony of my Spion and take my own personal experience why
does my young friend Max brightest of all schoolboys who already
wears the cap that denotes the highest classwhy does he shock me by
suddenly drawing forth a pair of spectacles that upon his fresh rosy
face would be an obvious mocking imitation of the Herr Papaif German
children could ever by any possibility be irreverent Or why does the
Fraulein Marie his sister pink as Aurora round as Hebe suddenly
veil her blue eyes with a golden lorgnette in the midst of our polyglot
conversation Is it to evade the direct admiring glance of the
impulsive American Dare I say NO Dare I say that that frank clear
honest earnest return of the eye which has on the Continent most
unfairly brought my fair countrywomen under criticism is quite as
common to her more carefullyguarded traditionhedged German sisters
No it is not that Is it any thing in these emerald and opal tinted
skies which seem so unreal to the American eye and for the first time
explain what seemed the unreality of German art in these mysterious yet
restful Rhine fogs which prolong the twilight and hang the curtain
of romance even over midday Surely not Is it not rather O Herr
Professor profound in analogy and philosophyis it not rather
this abominable blackletter this elsewherediscarded uncouth
slowlydecaying text known as the German Alphabet that plucks out the
bright eyes of youth and bristles the gateways of your language with a
chevaux de frise of splintered rubbish Why must I hesitate whether it
is an accident of the printers press or the poor quality of the paper
that makes this letter a k or a t Why must I halt in an emotion or
a thought because s and f are so nearly alike Is it not enough that
I an impulsive American accustomed to do a thing first and reflect
upon it afterwards must grope my way through a blind alley of
substantives and adjectives only to find the verb of action in an
obscure corner without ruining my eyesight in the groping

But I dismiss these abstract reflections for a fresh and active
resentment This is the fifth or sixth dog that has passed my Spion
harnessed to a small barrowlike cart and tugging painfully at a
burden so ludicrously disproportionate to his size that it would seem a
burlesque but for the poor dogs sad sincerity Perhaps it is because
I have the barbarians fondness for dogs and for their lawless gentle
loving uselessness that I rebel against this unnatural servitude It
seems as monstrous as if a child were put between the shafts and made
to carry burdens and I have come to regard those men and women who in
the weakest perfunctory way affect to aid the poor brute by laying
idle hands on the barrow behind as I would unnatural parents
Pegasus harnessed to the Thracian herdsmans plough was no more of a
desecration I fancy the poor dog seems to feel the monstrosity of the
performance and in sheer shame for his master forgivingly tries to
assume it is PLAY and I have seen a little colley running along
barking and endeavoring to leap and gambol in the shafts before a load
that any one out of this locality would have thought the direst cruelty
Nor do the older or more powerful dogs seem to become accustomed to
it When his cruel taskmaster halts with his wares instantly the dog
either by sitting down in his harness or crawling over the shafts or
by some unmistakable doglike trick utterly scatters any such delusion
of even the habit of servitude The few of his race who do not work in
this ducal city seem to have lost their democratic canine sympathies
and look upon him with something of that indifferent calm with which
yonder officer eyes the roadmender in the ditch below him He loses
even the characteristics of species The common cur and mastiff look
alike in harness The burden levels all distinctions I have said that
he was generally sincere in his efforts I recall but one instance to
the contrary I remember a young colley who first attracted my attention
by his persistent barking Whether he did this as the ploughboy
whistled for want of thought or whether it was a running protest
against his occupation I could not determine until one day I noticed
that in barking he slightly threw up his neck and shoulders and that
the twowheeled barrowlike vehicle behind him having its weight evenly
poised on the wheels by the trucks in the hands of its driver enabled
him by this movement to cunningly throw the center of gravity and the
greater weight on the mana fact which that less sagacious brute never
discerned Perhaps I am using a strong expression regarding his driver
It may be that the purely animal wants of the dog in the way of food
care and shelter are more bountifully supplied in servitude than in
freedom becoming a valuable and useful property he may be cared for
and protected as such an odd recollection that this argument had been
used forcibly in regard to human slavery in my own country strikes me
here but his picturesqueness and poetry are gone and I cannot
help thinking that the people who have lost this gentle sympathetic
characteristic figure from their domestic life and surroundings have not
acquired an equal gain through his harsh labors

To the American eye there is throughout the length and breadth of
this foreign city no more notable and striking object than the average
German houseservant It is not that she has passed my Spion a dozen
times within the last hourfor here she is messenger porter and
commissionnaire as well as housemaid and cookbut that she is always
a phenomenon to the American stranger accustomed to be abused in
his own country by his foreign Irish handmaiden Her presence is as
refreshing and grateful as the morning light and as inevitable and
regular When I add that with the novelty of being well served is
combined the satisfaction of knowing that you have in your household an
intelligent being who reads and writes with fluency and yet does not
abstract your books nor criticise your literary composition who is
cleanly clad and neat in her person without the suspicion of having
borrowed her mistresss dresses who may be goodlooking without the
least imputation of coquetry or addition to her followers who is
obedient without servility polite without flattery willing and replete
with supererogatory performance without the expectation of immediate
pecuniary return what wonder that the American householder translated
into German life feels himself in a new Eden of domestic possibilities
unrealized in any other country and begins to believe in a present and
future of domestic happiness What wonder that the American bachelor
living in German lodgings feels half the terrors of the conjugal future
removed and rushes madly into loveand housekeeping What wonder that
I a longsuffering and patient master who have been served by the
reticent but too imitative Chinaman who have been Massa to the
childlike but untruthful negro who have been the recipient of the
brotherly but uncertain ministrations of the SouthSea Islander and
have been proudly disregarded by the American aborigine only in due
time to meet the fate of my countrymen at the hands of Bridget the
Celtwhat wonder that I gladly seize this opportunity to sing the
praises of my German handmaid Honor to thee Lenchen wherever
thou goest Heaven bless thee in thy walks abroad whether with that
tightlybooted cavalryman in thy Sunday gown and best or in blue
polkadotted apron and bare head as thou trottest nimbly on mine
errandserrands which Bridget oFlaherty would scorn to undertake or
undertaking would hopelessly blunder in Heaven bless thee child
in thy early risings and in thy later sittings at thy festive board
overflowing with Essig and Fett in the mysteries of thy Kuchen in the
fulness of thy Bier and in thy nightly suffocations beneath mountainous
and multitudinous feathers Good honest simpleminded cheerful
dutyloving Lenchen Have not thy brothers strong and dutiful as thou
lent their gravity and earnestness to sweeten and strengthen the fierce
youth of the Republic beyond the seas and shall not thy children
inherit the broad prairies that still wait for them and discover the
fatness thereof and send a portion transmuted in glittering shekels
back to thee

Almost as notable are the children whose round faces have as frequently
been reflected in my Spion Whether it is only a fancy of mine that
the average German retains longer than any other race his childish
simplicity and unconsciousness or whether it is because I am more
accustomed to the extreme selfassertion and early maturity of American
children I know not but I am inclined to believe that among no
other people is childhood as perennial and to be studied in such
characteristic and quaint and simple phases as here The picturesqueness
of Spanish and Italian childhood has a faint suspicion of the pantomime
and the conscious attitudinizing of the Latin races German children are
not exuberant or volatile they are seriousa seriousness however
not to be confounded with the grave reflectiveness of age but only the
abstract wonderment of childhood for all those who have made a loving
study of the young human animal will I think admit that its dominant
expression is GRAVITY and not playfulness and will be satisfied
that he erred pitifully who first ascribed lightheartedness and
thoughtlessness as part of its phenomena These little creatures I
meet upon the streetwhether in quaint wooden shoes and short woollen
petticoats or neatly booted and furred with school knapsacks jauntily
borne upon little square shouldersall carry likewise in their round
chubby faces their profound wonderment and astonishment at the big busy
world into which they have so lately strayed If I stop to speak with
this little maid who scarcely reaches to the topboots of yonder cavalry
officer there is less of bashful selfconsciousness in her sweet little
face than of grave wonder at the foreign accent and strange ways of
this new figure obtruded upon her limited horizon She answers honestly
frankly prettily but gravely There is a remote possibility that I
might bite and with this suspicion plainly indicated in her round
blue eyes she quietly slips her little red hand from mine and moves
solemnly away I remember once to have stopped in the street with a fair
countrywoman of mine to interrogate a little figure in sabotsthe
one quaint object in the long formal perspective of narrow gray
bastardItalian facaded houses of a Rhenish German Strasse The sweet
little figure wore a darkblue woollen petticoat that came to its knees
gray woollen stockings covered the shapely little limbs below and
its very blonde hair the color of a bright dandelion was tied in a
pathetic little knot at the back of its round head and garnished with
an absurd green ribbon Now although this gentlewomans sympathies were
catholic and universal unfortunately their expression was limited to
her own mothertongue She could not help pouring out upon the child the
maternal love that was in her own womanly breast nor could she withhold
the babytalk through which it was expressed But alas it was in
English Hence ensued a colloquy tender and extravagant on the part of
the elder grave and wondering on the part of the child But the lady
had a natural feminine desire for reciprocity particularly in the
presence of our emotionscorning sex and as a last resource she emptied
the small silver of her purse into the lap of the coy maiden It was
a declaration of love susceptible of translation at the nearest
cakeshop But the little maid whose dress and manner certainly did not
betray an habitual disregard of gifts of this kind looked at the coin
thoughtfully but not regretfully Some innate sense of duty equally
strong with that of being polite to strangers filled her consciousness
With the utterly unexpected remark that her father did not allow her
to take money the queer little figure moved away leaving the two
Americans covered with mortification The rare American child who could
have done this would have done it with an attitude This little German
bourgeoise did it naturally I do not intend to rush to the deduction
that German children of the lower classes habitually refuse pecuniary
gratuities indeed I remember to have wickedly suggested to my
companion that to avoid impoverishment in a foreign land she should
not repeat the story nor the experiment But I simply offer it as a
fact and to an American at home or abroad a novel one

I owe to these little figures another experience quite as strange
It was at the close of a dull winters daya day from which all
outofdoor festivity seemed to be naturally excluded there was a
baleful promise of snow in the air and a dismal reminiscence of it under
foot when suddenly in striking contrast with the dreadful bleakness
of the street a half dozen children masked and bedizened with cheap
ribbons spangles and embroidery flashed across my Spion I was quick
to understand the phenomenon It was the Carnival season Only the night
before I had been to the great opening masqueradea famous affair for
which this artloving city is noted and to which strangers are drawn
from all parts of the Continent I remember to have wondered if
the pleasureloving German in America had not broken some of his
conventional shackles in emigration for certainly I had found the
Carnival balls of the Lieder Kranz Society in New York although
decorous and fashionable to the American taste to be wild dissipations
compared with the practical seriousness of this native performance and
I hailed the presence of these children in the open street as a promise
of some extravagance real untrammelled and characteristic I seized
my hat andOVERCOATa dreadful incongruity to the spangles that had
whisked by and followed the vanishing figures round the corner Here
they were reenforced by a dozen men and women fantastically but not
expensively arrayed looking not unlike the supernumeraries of some
provincial opera troupe Following the crowd which already began to
pour in from the sidestreets in a few moments I was in the broad
grovelike allee and in the midst of the masqueraders

I remember to have been told that this was a characteristic annual
celebration of the lower classes anticipated with eagerness and
achieved with difficulty indeed often only through the alternative of
pawning clothing and furniture to provide the means for this ephemeral
transformation I remember being warned also that the buffoonery was
coarse and some of the slang hardly fit for ears polite But I am
afraid that I was not shocked at the prodigality of these poor people
who purchased a holiday on such hard conditions and as to the
coarseness of the performance I felt that I certainly might go where
these children could

At first the masquerading figures appeared to be mainly composed of
young girls of ages varying from nine to eighteen Their costumesif
what was often only the addition of a broad brightcolored stripe to
the hem of a short dress could be called a COSTUMEwere plain and
seemed to indicate no particular historical epoch or character A
general suggestion of the peasants holiday attire was dominant in
all the costumes Everybody was closely masked All carried a short
gaylystriped baton of split wood called a Pritsche which when struck
sharply on the back or shoulders of some spectator or sistermasker
emitted a clattering rasping sound To wander hand in hand down this
broad allee to strike almost mechanically and often monotonously
at each other with their batons seemed to be the extent of that wild
dissipation The crowd thickened Young men with false noses hideous
masks cheap black or red cotton dominoes soldiers in uniform crowded
past each other up and down the promenade all carrying a Pritsche
and exchanging blows with each other but always with the same slow
seriousness of demeanor which with their silence gave the performance
the effect of a religious rite Occasionally some one shouted perhaps a
dozen young fellows broke out in song but the shout was provocative of
nothing the song faltered as if the singers were frightened at their
own voices One blithe fellow with a bears head on his furcapped
shoulders began to dance but on the crowd stopping to observe
him seriously he apparently thought better of it and slipped away
Nevertheless the solemn beating of Pritschen over each others backs
went on I remember that I was followed the whole length of the allee by
a little girl scarcely twelve years old in a bright striped skirt and
black mask who from time to time struck me over the shoulders with a
regularity and sad persistency that was peculiarly irresistible to
me the more so as I could not help thinking that it was not half as
amusing to herself Once only did the ordinary brusque gallantry of the
Carnival spirit show itself A man with an enormous pair of horns like
a halfcivilized satyr suddenly seized a young girl and endeavored to
kiss her A slight struggle ensued in which I fancied I detected in the
girls face and manner the confusion and embarrassment of one who
was obliged to overlook or seem to accept a familiarity that was
distasteful rather than be laughed at for prudishness or ignorance But
the incident was exceptional Indeed it was particularly notable to my
American eyes to find such decorum where there might easily have been
the greatest license I am afraid that an American mob of this class
would have scarcely been as orderly and civil under the circumstances
They might have shown more humor but there would have probably been
more effrontery they might have been more exuberant they would
certainly have been drunker I did not notice a single masquerader
unduly excited by liquor there was not a word or motion from the
lighter sex that could have been construed into an impropriety There
was something almost pathetic to me in this attempt to wrest gayety and
excitement out of these dull materials to fight against the blackness
of that wintry sky and the stubborn hardness of the frozen soil with
these painted sticks of wood to mock the dreariness of their poverty
with these flaunting raiments It did not seem like them or rather
consistent with my idea of them There was incongruity deeper than their
bizarre externals a halfmelancholy halfcrazy absurdity in their
action the substitution of a grim spasmodic frenzy for levity that
rightly or wrongly impressed me When the increasing gloom of the
evening made their figures undistinguishable I turned into the first
crossstreet As I lifted my hat to my persistent young friend with the
Pritsche I fancied she looked as relieved as myself If however I
was mistaken if that childs pathway through life be strewn with rosy
recollections of the unresisting back of the stranger American if any
burden O Gretchen laid upon thy young shoulders be lighter for the
trifling one thou didst lay upon mineknow then that I too am
content

And so day by day has my Spion reflected the various changing forms
of life before it It has seen the first flush of spring in the broad
allee when the shadows of tiny leaflets overhead were beginning to
checker the cool square flagstones It has seen the glare and fulness
of summer sunshine and shadow the flying of November gold through the
air the gaunt limbs and stark rigid deathlike whiteness of winter
It has seen children in their queer wicker babycarriages old men and
women and occasionally that grim usher of death in sable cloak and
cocked hata baleful figure for the wandering invalid tourist to
meetwho acts as undertaker for this ducal city and marshals the
last melancholy procession I well remember my first meeting with this
ominous functionary It was an early autumnal morning so early that
the long formal perspective of the allee and the decorous smooth
vanishinglines of creamandgray fronted houses were unrelieved by a
single human figure Suddenly a tall black spectre as theatrical and
as unreal as the painted scenic distance turned the corner from a
crossstreet and moved slowly towards me A long black cloak falling
from its shoulders to its feet floated out on either side like sable
wings a cocked hat trimmed with crape and surmounted by a hearselike
feather covered a passionless face and its eyes looking neither left
nor right were fixed fatefully upon some distant goal Stranger as I
was to this Continental ceremonial figure there was no mistaking his
functions as the grim messenger knocking with equal foot on every
door and indeed so perfectly did he act and look his role that there
was nothing ludicrous in the extraordinary spectacle Facial expression
and dignity of bearing were perfect the whole man seemed saturated with
the accepted sentiment of his office Recalling the halfconfused
and halfconscious ostentatious hypocrisy of the American sexton the
shameless absurdities of the English mutes and mourners I could not
help feeling that if it were demanded that Grief and Fate should be
personified it were better that it should be well done And it is
one observation of my Spion that this sincerity and belief is the
characteristic of all Continental functionaries

It is possible that my Spion has shown me little that is really
characteristic of the people and the few observations I have made I
offer only as an illustration of the impressions made upon twothirds of
American strangers in the larger towns of Germany Assimilation goes on
more rapidly than we are led to imagine As I have seen my friend Karl
fresh and awkward in his first uniform lounging later down the allee
with the blase listlessness of a fullblown militaire so I have seen
American and English residents gradually lose their peculiarities and
melt and merge into the general mass Returning to my Spion after
a flying trip through Belgium and France as I look down the long
perspective of the Strasse I am conscious of recalling the same style
of architecture and humanity at Aachen Brussels Lille and Paris and
am inclined to believe that even as I would have met in a journey of
the same distance through a parallel of the same latitude in America a
greater diversity of type and character and a more distinct flavor of
locality even so would I have met a more heterogeneous and picturesque
display from a club window on Fifth Avenue New York or Montgomery
Street San Francisco
