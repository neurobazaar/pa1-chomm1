Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we do usually do NOT keep
these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

pfist iNotwithstandingi was by Johnson and Webster viewed
as a participle absolute an English equivalent of the Latin inon
obstantei Its several meanings either as preposition adverb or

participle and can be treated as such prefer to class it as a
preposition or disjunctive conjunctionp

these words when applied to ithingsi suppose greater
opposition than inotwithstandingi We should say He was thrust

inotwithstandingi On the other hand it would be more civil
to say iNotwithstandingi all you have said I must still

odorless gaseous element occurring in the free state in the
atmosphere of which it forms about 23 per cent by weight and about
21 per cent by volume being slightly heavier than nitrogen Symbol
O Atomic weight 1596defp

pfist It occurs combined in immense quantities forming eight
ninths by weight of water and probably one half by weight of the
entire solid crust of the globe being an ingredient of silica the
silicates sulphates carbonates nitrates etc Oxygen combines with
all elements except fluorine forming oxides bases oxyacid
anhydrides etc the process in general being called
ioxidationi of which icombustioni is only an intense
modification At ordinary temperatures with most substances it is
moderately active but at higher temperatures it is one of the most
violent and powerful chemical agents known It is indispensable in
respiration and in general is the most universally active and
efficient element It may be prepared in the pure state by heating
potassium chloratep

p This element called idephlogisticated airi by Priestley
was named ioxygeni by Lavoisier because he supposed it to be a
constituent of all acids This is not so in the case of a very few
acids as ihydrochlorici ihydrobromici ihydric
sulphidei etc but these do contain elements analogous to
oxygen in property and action Moreover the fact that most elements
approach the nearer to iacidi qualities in proportion as they
are combined with more oxygen shows the great accuracy and breadth
of Lavoisiers conception of its naturep
