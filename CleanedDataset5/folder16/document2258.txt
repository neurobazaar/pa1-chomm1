Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

Project Gutenbergs Etext of Shakespeares The Famous History
of the Life of King Henry the Eight






Executive Directors Notes

In addition to the notes below and so you will NOT think all
the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
been corrected here are the first few lines of Hamlet as they
are presented herein

 Barnardo Whos there
 Fran Nay answer me Stand  vnfold
your selfe

 Bar Long liue the King



As I understand it the printers often ran out of certain words
or letters they had often packed into a cliche  this is the
original meaning of the term cliche  and thus being unwilling
to unpack the cliches and thus you will see some substitutions
that look very odd  such as the exchanges of u for v v for u
above  and you may wonder why they did it this way presuming
Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner   

The answer is that they MAY have packed liue into a cliche at a
time when they were out of vs  possibly having used vv in
place of some ws etc This was a common practice of the day
as print was still quite expensive and they didnt want to spend
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to

You will find a lot of these kinds of errors in this text as I
have mentioned in other times and places many scholars have an
extreme attachment to these errors and many have accorded them a
very high place in the canon of Shakespeare My father read an
assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
purpose To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
  in great detail  and determined from the various changes
that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
variety of errors we credit him for even though he was infamous
for signing his name with several different spellings

So please take this into account when reading the comments below
made by our volunteer who prepared this file you may see errors
that are not errors   

So  with this caveat  we have NOT changed the canon errors
here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeares The Famous
History of the Life of King Henry the Eight

Scanners Notes What this is and isnt This was taken from
a copy of Shakespeares first folio and it is as close as I can
come in ASCII to the printed text

The elongated Ss have been changed to small ss and the
conjoined ae have been changed to ae I have left the spelling
punctuation capitalization as close as possible to the
printed text I have corrected some spelling mistakes I have put
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
Geneva Bible and Shakespeares First Folio and have unified
spellings according to this template typos and expanded
abbreviations as I have come across them Everything within
brackets  is what I have added So if you dont like that
you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
purer Shakespeare

Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
differences between various copies of the first folio So there may
be differences other than what I have mentioned above between
this and other first folio editions This is due to the printers
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
continuing the printing run The proof run wasnt thrown away but
incorporated into the printed copies This is just the way it is
The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
First Folio editions best pages

If you find any scanning errors out and out typos punctuation
errors or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
free to email me those errors I wish to make this the best
etext possible My email address for right now are haraddaaolcom
and davidrinconnectcom I hope that you enjoy this

THE PROLOGVE


I Come no more to make you laugh Things now
That beare a Weighty and a Serious Brow
Sad high and working full of State and Woe
Such Noble Scoenes as draw the Eye to flow
We now present Those that can Pitty heere
May if they thinke it well let fall a Teare
The Subiect will deserue it Such as giue
Their Money out of hope they may beleeue
May heere finde Truth too Those that come to see
Onely a show or two and so agree
The Play may passe If they be still and willing
Ile vndertake may see away their shilling
Richly in two short houres Onely they
That come to heare a Merry Bawdy Play
A noyse of Targets Or to see a Fellow
In a long Motley Coate garded with Yellow
Will be deceyud For gentle Hearers know
To ranke our chosen Truth with such a show
As Foole and Fight is beside forfeyting
Our owne Braines and the Opinion that we bring
To make that onely true we now intend
Will leaue vs neuer an vnderstanding Friend
Therefore for Goodnesse sake and as you are knowne
The First and Happiest Hearers of the Towne
Be sad as we would make ye Thinke ye see
The very Persons of our Noble Story
As they were Liuing Thinke you see them Great
And followd with the generall throng and sweat
Of thousand Friends Then in a moment see
How soone this Mightinesse meets Misery
And if you can be merry then Ile say
A Man may weepe vpon his Wedding day

Actus Primus Scoena Prima

Enter the Duke of Norfolke at one doore At the other the Duke of
Buckingham and the Lord Aburgauenny

 Buckingham Good morrow and well met How haue ye done
Since last we saw in France
 Norf I thanke your Grace
Healthfull and euer since a fresh Admirer
Of what I saw there

 Buck An vntimely Ague
Staid me a Prisoner in my Chamber when
Those Sunnes of Glory those two Lights of Men
Met in the vale of Andren

 Nor Twixt Guynes and Arde
I was then present saw them salute on Horsebacke
Beheld them when they lighted how they clung
In their Embracement as they grew together
Which had they
What foure Thrond ones could haue weighd
Such a compounded one
 Buck All the whole time
I was my Chambers Prisoner

 Nor Then you lost
The view of earthly glory Men might say
Till this time Pompe was single but now married
To one aboue it selfe Each following day
Became the next dayes master till the last
Made former Wonders its To day the French
All Clinquant all in Gold like Heathen Gods
Shone downe the English and to morrow they
Made Britaine India Euery man that stood
Shewd like a Mine Their Dwarfish Pages were
As Cherubins all gilt the Madams too
Not vsd to toyle did almost sweat to beare
The Pride vpon them that their very labour
Was to them as a Painting Now this Maske
Was cryde incompareable and th ensuing night
Made it a Foole and Begger The two Kings
Equall in lustre were now best now worst
As presence did present them Him in eye
Still him in praise and being present both
Twas said they saw but one and no Discerner
Durst wagge his Tongue in censure when these Sunnes
For so they phrase em by their Heralds challengd
The Noble Spirits to Armes they did performe
Beyond thoughts Compasse that former fabulous Storie
Being now seene possible enough got credit
That Beuis was beleeud

 Buc Oh you go farre

 Nor As I belong to worship and affect
In Honor Honesty the tract of eury thing
Would by a good Discourser loose some life
Which Actions selfe was tongue too

 Buc All was Royall
To the disposing of it nought rebelld
Order gaue each thing view The Office did
Distinctly his full Function who did guide
I meane who set the Body and the Limbes
Of this great Sport together
 Nor As you guesse
One certes that promises no Element
In such a businesse

 Buc I pray you who my Lord
 Nor All this was ordred by the good Discretion
Of the right Reuerend Cardinall of Yorke

 Buc The diuell speed him No mans Pye is freed
From his Ambitious finger What had he
To do in these fierce Vanities I wonder
That such a Keech can with his very bulke
Take vp the Rayes oth beneficiall Sun
And keepe it from the Earth

 Nor Surely Sir
Theres in him stuffe that puts him to these ends
For being not propt by Auncestry whose grace
Chalkes Successors their way nor calld vpon
For high feats done toth Crowne neither Allied
To eminent Assistants but Spiderlike
Out of his Selfedrawing Web O giues vs note
The force of his owne merit makes his way
A guift that heauen giues for him which buyes
A place next to the King

 Abur I cannot tell
What Heauen hath giuen him let some Grauer eye
Pierce into that but I can see his Pride
Peepe through each part of him whence has he that
If not from Hell The Diuell is a Niggard
Or has giuen all before and he begins
A new Hell in himselfe

 Buc Why the Diuell
Vpon this French going out tooke he vpon him
Without the priuity oth King t appoint
Who should attend on him He makes vp the File
Of all the Gentry for the most part such
To whom as great a Charge as little Honor
He meant to lay vpon and his owne Letter
The Honourable Boord of Councell out
Must fetch him in he Papers

 Abur I do know
Kinsmen of mine three at the least that haue
By this so sickend their Estates that neuer
They shall abound as formerly

 Buc O many
Haue broke their backes with laying Mannors on em
For this great Iourney What did this vanity
But minister communication of
A most poore issue

 Nor Greeuingly I thinke
The Peace betweene the French and vs not valewes
The Cost that did conclude it

 Buc Euery man
After the hideous storme that followd was
A thing Inspird and not consulting broke
Into a generall Prophesie That this Tempest
Dashing the Garment of this Peace aboaded
The sodaine breach ont

 Nor Which is budded out
For France hath flawd the League and hath attachd
Our Merchants goods at Burdeux

 Abur Is it therefore
Th Ambassador is silencd
 Nor Marry ist

 Abur A proper Title of a Peace and purchasd
At a superfluous rate

 Buc Why all this Businesse
Our Reuerend Cardinall carried

 Nor Like it your Grace
The State takes notice of the priuate difference
Betwixt you and the Cardinall I aduise you
And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
Honor and plenteous safety that you reade
The Cardinals Malice and his Potency
Together To consider further that
What his high Hatred would effect wants not
A Minister in his Power You know his Nature
That hes Reuengefull and I know his Sword
Hath a sharpe edge Its long andt may be saide
It reaches farre and where twill not extend
Thither he darts it Bosome vp my counsell
Youl finde it wholesome Loe where comes that Rock
That I aduice your shunning
Enter Cardinall Wolsey the Purse borne before him certaine of
the Guard
and two Secretaries with Papers The Cardinall in his passage
fixeth his
eye on Buckingham and Buckingham on him both full of
disdaine

 Car The Duke of Buckinghams Surueyor Ha
Wheres his Examination
 Secr Heere so please you

 Car Is he in person ready
 Secr I please your Grace

 Car Well we shall then know more  Buckingham
Shall lessen this bigge looke

Exeunt Cardinall and his Traine

 Buc This Butchers Curre is venomdmouthd and I
Haue not the power to muzzle him therefore best
Not wake him in his slumber A Beggers booke
Outworths a Nobles blood

 Nor What are you chaffd
Aske God for Temprance thats th appliance onely
Which your disease requires

 Buc I read ins looks
Matter against me and his eye reuild
Me as his abiect obiect at this instant
He bores me with some tricke Hes gone toth King
Ile follow and outstare him

 Nor Stay my Lord
And let your Reason with your Choller question
What tis you go about to climbe steepe hilles
Requires slow pace at first Anger is like
A full hot Horse who being allowd his way
Selfemettle tyres him Not a man in England
Can aduise me like you Be to your selfe
As you would to your Friend

 Buc Ile to the King
And from a mouth of Honor quite cry downe
This Ipswich fellowes insolence or proclaime
Theres difference in no persons

 Norf Be aduisd
Heat not a Furnace for your foe so hot
That it do sindge your selfe We may outrunne
By violent swiftnesse that which we run at
And lose by ouerrunning know you not
The fire that mounts the liquor tilt run ore
In seeming to augment it wasts it be aduisd
I say againe there is no English Soule
More stronger to direct you then your selfe
If with the sap of reason you would quench
Or but allay the fire of passion

 Buck Sir
I am thankfull to you and Ile goe along
By your prescription but this topproud fellow
Whom from the flow of gall I name not but
From sincere motions by Intelligence
And proofes as cleere as Founts in Iuly when
Wee see each graine of grauell I doe know
To be corrupt and treasonous

 Norf Say not treasonous

 Buck To th King Ile sayt  make my vouch as strong
As shore of Rocke attend This holy Foxe
Or Wolfe or both for he is equall raunous
As he is subtile and as prone to mischiefe
As able to performt his minde and place
Infecting one another yea reciprocally
Only to shew his pompe as well in France
As here at home suggests the King our Master
To this last costly Treaty Th enteruiew
That swallowed so much treasure and like a glasse
Did breake ith wrenching

 Norf Faith and so it did

 Buck Pray giue me fauour Sir This cunning Cardinall
The Articles oth Combination drew
As himselfe pleasd and they were ratified
As he cride thus let be to as much end
As giue a Crutch to th dead But our CountCardinall
Has done this and tis well for worthy Wolsey
Who cannot erre he did it Now this followes
Which as I take it is a kinde of Puppie
To th old dam Treason Charles the Emperour
Vnder pretence to see the Queene his Aunt
For twas indeed his colour but he came
To whisper Wolsey here makes visitation
His feares were that the Interview betwixt
England and France might through their amity
Breed him some preiudice for from this League
Peepd harmes that menacd him Priuily
Deales with our Cardinal and as I troa
Which I doe well for I am sure the Emperour
Paid ere he promisd whereby his Suit was granted
Ere it was askd But when the way was made
And paud with gold the Emperor thus desird
That he would please to alter the Kings course
And breake the foresaid peace Let the King know
As soone he shall by me that thus the Cardinall
Does buy and sell his Honour as he pleases
And for his owne aduantage

 Norf I am sorry
To heare this of him and could wish he were
Somthing mistaken int

 Buck No not a sillable
I doe pronounce him in that very shape
He shall appeare in proofe
Enter Brandon a Sergeant at Armes before him and two or three
of the
Guard

 Brandon Your Office Sergeant execute it

 Sergeant Sir
My Lord the Duke of Buckingham and Earle
Of Hertford Stafford and Northampton I
Arrest thee of High Treason in the name
Of our most Soueraigne King

 Buck Lo you my Lord
The net has falne vpon me I shall perish
Vnder deuice and practise

 Bran I am sorry
To see you tane from liberty to looke on
The busines present Tis his Highnes pleasure

Be done in this and all things I obey
O my Lord Aburgany Fare you well

 Bran Nay he must beare you company The King
Is pleasd you shall to th Tower till you know
How he determines further

 Bran Here is a warrant from
The King t attach Lord Mountacute and the Bodies
Of the Dukes Confessor Iohn de la Car

Of my Petition

 Kin Lady mine proceed

 Queen I am solicited not by a few
And those of true condition That your Subiects
Are in great grieuance There haue beene Commissions
Sent downe among em which hath flawd the heart
Of all their Loyalties wherein although
My good Lord Cardinall they vent reproches
Most bitterly on you as putter on
Of these exactions yet the King our Maister
Whose Honor Heauen shield from soile euen he escapes not
Language vnmannerly yea such which breakes
The sides of loyalty and almost appeares
In lowd Rebellion

 Norf Not almost appeares
It doth appeare for vpon these Taxations
The Clothiers all not able to maintaine
The many to them longing haue put off
The Spinsters Carders Fullers Weauers who
Vnfit for other life compeld by hunger
And lack of other meanes in desperate manner
Daring th euent too th teeth are all in vprore
And danger serues among them

 Kin Taxation
Wherein and what Taxation My Lord Cardinall
You that are blamd for it alike with vs
Know you of this Taxation
 Card Please you Sir
I know but of a single part in ought
Pertaines to th State and front but in that File
Where others tell steps with me

 Queen No my Lord
You know no more then others But you frame
Things that are knowne alike which are not wholsome
To those which would not know them and yet must
Perforce be their acquaintance These exactions
Whereof my Soueraigne would haue note they are
Most pestilent to th hearing and to beare em
The Backe is Sacrifice to th load They say
They are deuisd by you or else you suffer
Too hard an exclamation

 Kin Still Exaction
The nature of it in what kinde lets know
Is this Exaction
 Queen I am much too venturous
In tempting of your patience but am boldned
Vnder your promisd pardon The Subiects griefe
Comes through Commissions which compels from each
The sixt part of his Substance to be leuied
Without delay and the pretence for this
Is namd your warres in France this makes bold mouths
Tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze
Allegeance in them their curses now
Liue where their prayers did and its come to passe
This tractable obedience is a Slaue
To each incensed Will I would your Highnesse
Would giue it quicke consideration for
There is no primer basenesse

 Kin By my life
This is against our pleasure

 Card And for me
I haue no further gone in this then by
A single voice and that not past me but
By learned approbation of the Iudges If I am
Traducd by ignorant Tongues which neither know
My faculties nor person yet will be
The Chronicles of my doing Let me say
Tis but the fate of Place and the rough Brake
That Vertue must goe through we must not stint
Our necessary actions in the feare
To cope malicious Censurers which euer
As raunous Fishes doe a Vessell follow
That is new trimd but benefit no further
Then vainly longing What we oft doe best
By sicke Interpreters once weake ones is
Not ours or not allowd what worst as oft
Hitting a grosser quality is cride vp
For our best Act if we shall stand still
In feare our motion will be mockd or carpd at
We should take roote here where we sit
Or sit StateStatues onely

 Kin Things done well
And with a care exempt themselues from feare
Things done without example in their issue
Are to be feard Haue you a President
Of this Commission I beleeue not any
We must not rend our Subiects from our Lawes
And sticke them in our Will Sixt part of each

Exit Secretary

Enter Surueyor

 Queen I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham
Is run in your displeasure

 Kin It grieues many
The Gentleman is Learnd and a most rare Speaker
To Nature none more bound his trayning such
That he may furnish and instruct great Teachers
And neuer seeke for ayd out of himselfe yet see
When these so Noble benefits shall proue
Not well disposd the minde growing once corrupt
They turne to vicious formes ten times more vgly
Then euer they were faire This man so compleat
Who was enrold mongst wonders and when we
Almost with rauishd listning could not finde
His houre of speech a minute He my Lady
Hath into monstrous habits put the Graces
That once were his and is become as blacke
As if besmeard in hell Sit by Vs you shall heare
This was his Gentleman in trust of him
Things to strike Honour sad Bid him recount
The forerecited practises whereof
We cannot feele too little heare too much

 Card Stand forth  with bold spirit relate what you
Most like a carefull Subiect haue collected
Out of the Duke of Buckingham

 Kin Speake freely

 Sur First it was vsuall with him euery day
It would infect his Speech That if the King
Should without issue dye heel carry it so
To make the Scepter his These very words
Iue heard him vtter to his Sonne in Law
Lord Aburgany to whom by oth he menacd
Reuenge vpon the Cardinall

 Card Please your Highnesse note
This dangerous conception in this point
Not frended by his wish to your High person
His will is most malignant and it stretches
Beyond you to your friends

 Queen My learnd Lord Cardinall
Deliuer all with Charity

 Kin Speake on
How grounded hee his Title to the Crowne
Vpon our faile to this poynt hast thou heard him
At any time speake ought
 Sur He was brought to this
By a vaine Prophesie of Nicholas Henton

 Kin What was that Henton
 Sur Sir a Chartreux Fryer
His Confessor who fed him euery minute
With words of Soueraignty

 Kin How knowst thou this
 Sur Not long before your Highnesse sped to France
The Duke being at the Rose within the Parish
Saint Laurence Poultney did of me demand
What was the speech among the Londoners
Concerning the French Iourney I replide
Men feare the French would proue perfidious
To the Kings danger presently the Duke
Said twas the feare indeed and that he doubted
Twould proue the verity of certaine words
Spoke by a holy Monke that oft sayes he
Hath sent to me wishing me to permit
Iohn de la Car my Chaplaine a choyce howre
To heare from him a matter of some moment
Whom after vnder the Commissions Seale
He sollemnly had sworne that what he spoke
My Chaplaine to no Creature liuing but
To me should vtter with demure Confidence
This pausingly ensude neither the King nors Heyres
Tell you the Duke shall prosper bid him striue
To the loue oth Commonalty the Duke
Shall gouerne England

 Queen If I know you well
You were the Dukes Surueyor and lost your Office
On the complaint oth Tenants take good heed
You charge not in your spleene a Noble person
And spoyle your nobler Soule I say take heed
Yes heartily beseech you

 Kin Let him on Goe forward

 Sur On my Soule Ile speake but truth
I told my Lord the Duke by th Diuels illusions
The Monke might be deceiud and that twas dangerous
For this to ruminate on this so farre vntill
It forgd him some designe which being beleeud
It was much like to doe He answerd Tush
It can do me no damage adding further
That had the King in his last Sicknesse faild
The Cardinals and Sir Thomas Louels heads
Should haue gone off

 Kin Ha What so rancke Ah ha
Theres mischiefe in this man canst thou say further
 Sur I can my Liedge

 Kin Proceed

 Sur Being at Greenwich
After your Highnesse had reproud the Duke
About Sir William Blumer

 Kin I remember of such a time being my sworn seruant
The Duke reteind him his But on what hence
 Sur If quoth he I for this had beene committed
As to the Tower I thought I would haue plaid
The Part my Father meant to act vpon
Th Vsurper Richard who being at Salsbury
Made suit to come ins presence which if granted
As he made semblance of his duty would
Haue put his knife into him

 Kin A Gyant Traytor

 Card Now Madam may his Highnes liue in freedome
And this man out of Prison

 Queen God mend all

 Kin Thers somthing more would out of thee what sayst
 Sur After the Duke his Father with the knife
He stretchd him and with one hand on his dagger
Another spread ons breast mounting his eyes
He did discharge a horrible Oath whose tenor
Was were he euill vsd he would outgoe
His Father by as much as a performance
Dos an irresolute purpose

 Kin Theres his period
To sheath his knife in vs he is attachd
Call him to present tryall if he may
Finde mercy in the Law tis his if none
Let him not seekt of vs By day and night
Hees Traytor to th height

Exeunt


Scaena Tertia

 LCh Ist possible the spels of France should iuggle
Men into such strange mysteries
 LSan New customes
Though they be neuer so ridiculous
Nay let em be vnmanly yet are followd

 LCh As farre as I see all the good our English
Haue got by the late Voyage is but meerely
A fit or two oth face but they are shrewd ones
For when they hold em you would sweare directly
Their very noses had been Councellours
To Pepin or Clotharius they keepe State so

 LSan They haue all new legs
And lame ones one would take it
That neuer see em pace before the Spauen
A Springhalt raind among em

 LCh Death my Lord
Their cloathes are after such a Pagan cut toot
That sure thhaue worne out Christendome how now
What newes Sir Thomas Louell
Enter Sir Thomas Louell

 Louell Faith my Lord
I heare of none but the new Proclamation
Thats clapt vpon the Court Gate

 LCham What ist for
 Lou The reformation of our traueld Gallants
That fill the Court with quarrels talke and Taylors

 LCham Im glad tis there
Now I would pray our Monsieurs
To thinke an English Courtier may be wise
And neuer see the Louure

 Lou They must either
For so run the Conditions leaue those remnants
Of Foole and Feather that they got in France
With all their honourable points of ignorance
Pertaining thereunto as Fights and Fireworkes
Abusing better men then they can be
Out of a forreigne wisedome renouncing cleane
The faith they haue in Tennis and tall Stockings
Short blistred Breeches and those types of Trauell
And vnderstand againe like honest men
Or pack to their old Playfellowes there I take it
They may Cum Priuilegio wee away
The lag end of their lewdnesse and be laughd at

 LSan Tis time to giue em Physicke their diseases
Are growne so catching

 LCham What a losse our Ladies
Will haue of these trim vanities
 Louell I marry
There will be woe indeed Lords the slye whorsons
Haue got a speeding tricke to lay downe Ladies
A French Song and a Fiddle has no Fellow

 LSan The Diuell fiddle em
I am glad they are going
For sure theres no conuerting of em now
An honest Country Lord as I am beaten
A long time out of play may bring his plaine song
And haue an houre of hearing and byr Lady
Held currant Musicke too

 LCham Well said Lord Sands
Your Colts tooth is not cast yet
 LSan No my Lord
Nor shall not while I haue a stumpe

 LCham Sir Thomas
Whither were you a going
 Lou To the Cardinals
Your Lordship is a guest too

 LCham O tis true
This night he makes a Supper and a great one
To many Lords and Ladies there will be
The Beauty of this Kingdome Ile assure you

 Lou That Churchman
Beares a bounteous minde indeed
A hand as fruitfull as the Land that feeds vs
His dewes fall euery where

 LCham No doubt hees Noble
He had a blacke mouth that said other of him

 LSan He may my Lord
Has wherewithall in him
Sparing would shew a worse sinne then ill Doctrine
Men of his way should be most liberall
They are set heere for examples

 LCham True they are so
But few now giue so great ones
My Barge stayes
Your Lordship shall along Come good Sir Thomas
We shall be late else which I would not be
For I was spoke to with Sir Henry Guilford
This night to be Comptrollers

 LSan I am your Lordships

Actus Secundus Scena Prima

Enter two Gentlemen at seuerall Doores

 1 Whether away so fast
 2 O God saue ye
Eun to the Hall to heare what shall become
Of the great Duke of Buckingham

 1 Ile saue you
That labour Sir Alls now done but the Ceremony
Of bringing backe the Prisoner

 2 Were you there 
 1 Yes indeed was I

 2 Pray speake what has happend

 1 You may guesse quickly what

 2 Is he found guilty
 1 Yes truely is he
And condemnd vpont

 2 I am sorry fort

 1 So are a number more

 2 But pray how past it
 1 Ile tell you in a little The great Duke
Came to the Bar where to his accusations
He pleaded still not guilty and alleadged
Many sharpe reasons to defeat the Law
The Kings Atturney on the contrary
Vrgd on the Examinations proofes confessions
Of diuers witnesses which the Duke desird
To him brought viua voce to his face
At which appeard against him his Surueyor
Sir Gilbert Pecke his Chancellour and Iohn Car
Confessor to him with that Diuell Monke
Hopkins that made this mischiefe

 2 That was hee
That fed him with his Prophecies

 1 The same
All these accusd him strongly which he faine
Would haue flung from him but indeed he could not
And so his Peeres vpon this euidence
Haue found him guilty of high Treason Much
He spoke and learnedly for life But all
Was either pittied in him or forgotten

 2 After all this how did he beare himselfe
 1 When he was brought agen to th Bar to heare
His Knell rung out his Iudgement he was stird
With such an Agony he sweat extreamly
And somthing spoke in choller ill and hasty
But he fell to himselfe againe and sweetly
In all the rest shewd a most Noble patience

 2 I doe not thinke he feares death

 1 Sure he does not
He neuer was so womanish the cause
He may a little grieue at

 2 Certainly
The Cardinall is the end of this

 1 Tis likely
By all coniectures First Kildares Attendure
Then Deputy of Ireland who remoud
Earle Surrey was sent thither and in hast too
Least he should helpe his Father

 2 That tricke of State
Was a deepe enuious one
 1 At his returne
No doubt he will requite it this is noted
And generally who euer the King fauours
The Cardnall instantly will finde imployment
And farre enough from Court too

 2 All the Commons
Hate him perniciously and o my Conscience
Wish him ten faddom deepe This Duke as much
They loue and doate on call him bounteous Buckingham
The Mirror of all courtesie
Enter Buckingham from his Arraignment Tipstaues before him
the Axe with
the edge towards him Halberds on each side accompanied with
Sir Thomas
Louell Sir Nicholas Vaux Sir Walter Sands and common people
c

 1 Stay there Sir
And see the noble ruind man you speake of

 2 Lets stand close and behold him

 Buck All good people
You that thus farre haue come to pitty me
Heare what I say and then goe home and lose me
I haue this day receiud a Traitors iudgement
And by that name must dye yet Heauen beare witnes
And if I haue a Conscience let it sincke me
Euen as the Axe falls if I be not faithfull
The Law I beare no mallice for my death
Thas done vpon the premises but Iustice
But those that sought it I could wish more Christians
Be what they will I heartily forgiue em
Yet let em looke they glory not in mischiefe
Nor build their euils on the graues of great men
For then my guiltlesse blood must cry against em
For further life in this world I nere hope
Nor will I sue although the King haue mercies
More then I dare make faults
You few that loud me
And dare be bold to weepe for Buckingham
His Noble Friends and Fellowes whom to leaue
Is only bitter to him only dying
Goe with me like good Angels to my end
And as the long diuorce of Steele fals on me
Make of your Prayers one sweet Sacrifice
And lift my Soule to Heauen
Lead on a Gods name

 Louell I doe beseech your Grace for charity
If euer any malice in your heart
Were hid against me now to forgiue me frankly

 Buck Sir Thomas Louell I as free forgiue you
As I would be forgiuen I forgiue all
There cannot be those numberlesse offences
Gainst me that I cannot take peace with
No blacke Enuy shall make my Graue
Commend mee to his Grace
And if he speake of Buckingham pray tell him
You met him halfe in Heauen my vowes and prayers
Yet are the Kings and till my Soule forsake
Shall cry for blessings on him May he liue
Longer then I haue time to tell his yeares
Euer beloud and louing may his Rule be
And when old Time shall lead him to his end
Goodnesse and he fill vp one Monument

 Lou To th water side I must conduct your Grace
Then giue my Charge vp to Sir Nicholas Vaux
Who vndertakes you to your end

 Vaux Prepare there
The Duke is comming See the Barge be ready
And fit it with such furniture as suites
The Greatnesse of his Person

 Buck Nay Sir Nicholas
Let it alone my State now will but mocke me
When I came hither I was Lord High Constable
And Duke of Buckingham now poore Edward Bohun
Yet I am richer then my base Accusers
That neuer knew what Truth meant I now seale it
And with that bloud will make em one day groane fort
My noble Father Henry of Buckingham
Who first raisd head against Vsurping Richard
Flying for succour to his Seruant Banister
Being distrest was by that wretch betraid
And without Tryall fell Gods peace be with him
Henry the Seauenth succeeding truly pittying
My Fathers losse like a most Royall Prince
Restord me to my Honours and out of ruines
Made my Name once more Noble Now his Sonne
Henry the Eight Life Honour Name and all
That made me happy at one stroake has taken
For euer from the World I had my Tryall
And must needs say a Noble one which makes me
A little happier then my wretched Father
Yet thus farre we are one in Fortunes both
Fell by our Seruants by those Men we loud most
A most vnnaturall and faithlesse Seruice
Heauen has an end in all yet you that heare me
This from a dying man receiue as certaine
Where you are liberall of your loues and Councels
Be sure you be not loose for those you make friends
And giue your hearts to when they once perceiue
The least rub in your fortunes fall away
Like water from ye neuer found againe
But where they meane to sinke ye all good people
Pray for me I must now forsake ye the last houre
Of my long weary life is come vpon me
Farewell and when you would say somthing that is sad
Speake how I fell
I haue done and God forgiue me

Exeunt Duke and Traine

 1 O this is full of pitty Sir it cals
I feare too many curses on their heads
That were the Authors

 2 If the Duke be guiltlesse
Tis full of woe yet I can giue you inckling
Of an ensuing euill if it fall
Greater then this

 1 Good Angels keepe it from vs
What may it be you doe not doubt my faith Sir
 2 This Secret is so weighty twill require
A strong faith to conceale it

 1 Let me haue it
I doe not talke much

 2 I am confident
You shall Sir Did you not of late dayes heare
A buzzing of a Separation
Betweene the King and Katherine
 1 Yes but it held not
For when the King once heard it out of anger
He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight
To stop the rumor and allay those tongues
That durst disperse it

 2 But that slander Sir
Is found a truth now for it growes agen
Fresher then ere it was and held for certaine
The King will venture at it Either the Cardinall
Or some about him neere haue out of malice
To the good Queene possest him with a scruple
That will vndoe her To confirme this too
Cardinall Campeius is arriud and lately
As all thinke for this busines

 1 Tis the Cardinall
And meerely to reuenge him on the Emperour
For not bestowing on him at his asking
The Archbishopricke of Toledo this is purposd

 2 I thinke
You haue hit the marke but ist not cruell
That she should feele the smart of this the Cardinall
Will haue his will and she must fall

 1 Tis wofull
Wee are too open heere to argue this
Lets thinke in priuate more

Exeunt

So good a Lady that no Tongue could euer
Pronounce dishonour of her by my life
She neuer knew harmedoing Oh now after
So many courses of the Sun enthroaned
Still growing in a Maiesty and pompe the which
To leaue a thousand fold more bitter then
Tis sweet at first t acquire After this Processe
To giue her the auaunt it is a pitty
Would moue a Monster

 Old La Hearts of most hard temper
Melt and lament for her

 An Oh Gods will much better
She nere had knowne pompe thought be temporall
Yet if that quarrell Fortune do diuorce
It from the bearer tis a sufferance panging
As soule and bodies seuering

 Old L Alas poore Lady
Shees a stranger now againe

 An So much the more
Must pitty drop vpon her verily
I sweare tis better to be lowly borne
And range with humble liuers in Content
Then to be perkd vp in a glistring griefe
And weare a golden sorrow

 Old L Our content
Is our best hauing

 Anne By my troth and Maidenhead
I would not be a Queene

 OldL Beshrew me I would
And venture Maidenhead fort and so would you
For all this spice of your Hipocrisie
You that haue so faire parts of Woman on you
Haue too a Womans heart which euer yet
Affected Eminence Wealth Soueraignty
Which to say sooth are Blessings and which guifts
Sauing your mincing the capacity
Of your soft Chiuerell Conscience would receiue
If you might please to stretch it

 Anne Nay good troth

 Old L Yes troth  troth you would not be a Queen
 Anne No not for all the riches vnder Heauen

 OldL Tis strange a threepence bowd would hire me
Old as I am to Queene it but I pray you
What thinke you of a Dutchesse Haue you limbs
To beare that load of Title
 An No in truth

 OldL Then you are weakly made plucke off a little
I would not be a young Count in your way
For more then blushing comes to If your backe
Cannot vouchsafe this burthen tis too weake
Euer to get a Boy

 An How you doe talke
I sweare againe I would not be a Queene
For all the world

 OldL In faith for little England
Yould venture an emballing I my selfe
Would for Carnaruanshire although there longd
No more to th Crowne but that Lo who comes here
Enter Lord Chamberlaine

 LCham Good morrow Ladies what wert worth to know

Perceiue I speake sincerely and high notes
Tane of your many vertues the Kings Maiesty
Commends his good opinion of you to you and
Does purpose honour to you no lesse flowing
Then Marchionesse of Pembrooke to which Title
A Thousand pound a yeare Annuall support
Out of his Grace he addes

 An I doe not know
What kinde of my obedience I should tender
More then my All is Nothing Nor my Prayers
Are not words duely hallowed nor my Wishes
More worth then empty vanities yet Prayers  Wishes
Are all I can returne Beseech your Lordship
Vouchsafe to speake my thankes and my obedience
As from a blushing Handmaid to his Highnesse
Whose health and Royalty I pray for

 Cham Lady
I shall not faile t approue the faire conceit
The King hath of you I haue perusd her well
Beauty and Honour in her are so mingled
That they haue caught the King and who knowes yet
But from this Lady may proceed a Iemme
To lighten all this Ile Ile to the King
And say I spoke with you

Exit Lord Chamberlaine

 An My honourd Lord

 OldL Why this it is See see
I haue beene begging sixteene yeares in Court
Am yet a Courtier beggerly nor could
Come pat betwixt too early and too late
For any suit of pounds and you oh fate
A very fresh Fish heere fye fye fye vpon
This compeld fortune haue your mouth fild vp
Before you open it

 An This is strange to me

 Old L How tasts it Is it bitter Forty pence no
There was a Lady once tis an old Story
That would not be a Queene that would she not
For all the mud in Egypt haue you heard it
 An Come you are pleasant

 OldL With your Theame I could
Oremount the Larke The Marchionesse of Pembrooke
A thousand pounds a yeare for pure respect
No other obligation by my Life
That promises mo thousands Honours traine

Are you not stronger then you were
 An Good Lady
Make your selfe mirth with your particular fancy
And leaue me out ont Would I had no being
If this salute my blood a iot it faints me
To thinke what followes

In our long absence pray doe not deliuer
What heere yhaue heard to her

 Old L What doe you thinke me

Or how farre further Shall is warranted
By a Commission from the Consistorie
Yea the whole Consistorie of Rome You charge me

The King is present If it be knowne to him
That I gainsay my Deed how may he wound

Remoue these Thoughts from you The which before

You gracious Madam to vnthinke your speaking
And to say so no more

 Queen My Lord My Lord
I am a simple woman much too weake
T oppose your cunning Yare meek  humblemouthd
You signe your Place and Calling in full seeming
With Meekenesse and Humilitie but your Heart

Gone slightly ore lowe steppes and now are mounted

You tender more your persons Honor then

Exit Queene and her Attendants

 Kin Goe thy wayes Kate
That man ith world who shall report he has
A better Wife let him in naught be trusted
For speaking false in that thou art alone
If thy rare qualities sweet gentlenesse
Thy meeknesse Saintlike Wifelike Gouernment
Obeying in commanding and thy parts
Soueraigne and Pious els could speake thee out
The Queene of earthly Queenes Shees Noble borne
And like her true Nobility she has
Carried her selfe towards me

 Wol Most gracious Sir
In humblest manner I require your Highnes
That it shall please you to declare in hearing
Of all these eares for where I am robd and bound
There must I be vnloosd although not there
At once and fully satisfide whether euer I
Did broach this busines to your Highnes or
Laid any scruple in your way which might
Induce you to the question ont or euer
Haue to you but with thankes to God for such
A Royall Lady spake one the least word that might
Be to the preiudice of her present State
Or touch of her good Person
 Kin My Lord Cardinall
I doe excuse you yea vpon mine Honour
I free you fromt You are not to be taught
That you haue many enemies that know not
Why they are so but like to Village Curres

The Queene is put in anger yare excusd
But will you be more iustifide You euer
Haue wishd the sleeping of this busines neuer desird
It to be stird but oft haue hindred oft
The passages made toward it on my Honour
I speake my good Lord Cardnall to this point
And thus farre cleare him
Now what moud me toot
I will be bold with time and your attention
Then marke th inducement Thus it came giue heede toot
My Conscience first receiud a tendernes
Scruple and pricke on certaine Speeches vtterd
By th Bishop of Bayon then French Embassador
Who had beene hither sent on the debating
And Marriage twixt the Duke of Orleance and
Our Daughter Mary Ith Progresse of this busines
Ere a determinate resolution hee
I meane the Bishop did require a respite
Wherein he might the King his Lord aduertise
Whether our Daughter were legitimate
Respecting this our Marriage with the Dowager
Sometimes our Brothers Wife This respite shooke
The bosome of my Conscience enterd me
Yea with a spitting power and made to tremble
The region of my Breast which forcd such way
That many mazd considerings did throng
And prest in with this Caution First me thought
I stood not in the smile of Heauen who had
Commanded Nature that my Ladies wombe
If it conceiud a malechild by me should
Doe no more Offices of life toot then
The Graue does to th dead For her Male Issue
Or dide where they were made or shortly after
This world had ayrd them Hence I tooke a thought
This was a Iudgement on me that my Kingdome
Well worthy the best Heyre oth World should not
Be gladded int by me Then followes that
I weighd the danger which my Realmes stood in
By this my Issues faile and that gaue to me
Many a groaning throw thus hulling in
The wild Sea of my Conscience I did steere
Toward this remedy whereupon we are
Now present heere together thats to say
I meant to rectifie my Conscience which
I then did feele full sicke and yet not well
By all the Reuerend Fathers of the Land
And Doctors learnd First I began in priuate
With you my Lord of Lincolne you remember
How vnder my oppression I did reeke
When I first moud you

 BLin Very well my Liedge

 Kin I haue spoke long be pleasd your selfe to say
How farre you satisfide me

 Lin So please your Highnes
The question did at first so stagger me
Bearing a State of mighty moment int
And consequence of dread that I committed
The daringst Counsaile which I had to doubt
And did entreate your Highnes to this course
Which you are running heere

 Kin I then moud you
My Lord of Canterbury and got your leaue
To make this present Summons vnsolicited
I left no Reuerend Person in this Court
But by particular consent proceeded
Vnder your hands and Seales therefore goe on
For no dislike ith world against the person
Of the good Queene but the sharpe thorny points
Of my alleadged reasons driues this forward
Proue but our Marriage lawfull by my Life

And Kingly Dignity we are contented
To weare our mortall State to come with her
Katherine our Queene before the primest Creature
Thats Parragond oth World

 Camp So please your Highnes
The Queene being absent tis a needfull fitnesse
That we adiourne this Court till further day
Meane while must be an earnest motion
Made to the Queene to call backe her Appeale
She intends vnto his Holinesse

 Kin I may perceiue
These Cardinals trifle with me I abhorre
This dilatory sloth and trickes of Rome
My learnd and welbeloued Seruant Cranmer
Prethee returne with thy approch I know
My comfort comes along breake vp the Court
I say set on

Exeunt in manner as they enterd

Killing care  griefe of heart
Fall asleepe or hearing dye

The full cause of our comming

 Queen Speake it heere
Theres nothing I haue done yet o my Conscience
Deserues a Corner would all other Women
Could speake this with as free a Soule as I doe
My Lords I care not so much I am happy
Aboue a number if my actions
Were tride by eury tongue eury eye saw em
Enuy and base opinion set against em
I know my life so euen If your busines
Seeke me out and that way I am Wife in
Out with it boldly Truth loues open dealing

 Card Tanta est erga te mentis integritas Regina serenissima

 Queen O good my Lord no Latin
I am not such a Truant since my comming
As not to know the Language I haue liud in
A strange Tongue makes my cause more strange suspitious
Pray speake in English heere are some will thanke you
If you speake truth for their poore Mistris sake
Beleeue me she has had much wrong Lord Cardinall
The willingst sinne I euer yet committed
May be absolud in English

 Card Noble Lady
I am sorry my integrity should breed
And seruice to his Maiesty and you
So deepe suspition where all faith was meant
We come not by the way of Accusation
To taint that honour euery good Tongue blesses
Nor to betray you any way to sorrow
You haue too much good Lady But to know
How you stand minded in the waighty difference
Betweene the King and you and to deliuer
Like free and honest men our iust opinions
And comforts to our cause

 Camp Most honourd Madam
My Lord of Yorke out of his Noble nature
Zeale and obedience he still bore your Grace
Forgetting like a good man your late Censure
Both of his truth and him which was too farre
Offers as I doe in a signe of peace
His Seruice and his Counsell

 Queen To betray me
My Lords I thanke you both for your good wills
Ye speake like honest men pray God ye proue so
But how to make ye sodainly an Answere
In such a poynt of weight so neere mine Honour
More neere my Life I feare with my weake wit
And to such men of grauity and learning
In truth I know not I was set at worke
Among my Maids full little God knowes looking
Either for such men or such businesse
For her sake that I haue beene for I feele
The last fit of my Greatnesse good your Graces
Let me haue time and Councell for my Cause
Alas I am a Woman frendlesse hopelesse

 Wol Madam
You wrong the Kings loue with these feares
Your hopes and friends are infinite

 Queen In England
But little for my profit can you thinke Lords
That any English man dare giue me Councell
Or be a knowne friend gainst his Highnes pleasure
Though he be growne so desperate to be honest
And liue a Subiect Nay forsooth my Friends
They that must weigh out my afflictions
They that my trust must grow to liue not heere
They are as all my other comforts far hence
In mine owne Countrey Lords

 Camp I would your Grace
Would leaue your greefes and take my Counsell

 Queen How Sir
 Camp Put your maine cause into the Kings protection

Both for your Honour better and your Cause

 Wol He tels you rightly

 Queen Ye tell me what ye wish for both my ruine

Heauen is aboue all yet there sits a Iudge
That no King can corrupt

 Camp Your rage mistakes vs

 Queen The more shame for ye holy men I thought ye
Vpon my Soule two reuerend Cardinall Vertues
But Cardinall Sins and hollow hearts I feare ye
Mend em for shame my Lords Is this your comfort
The Cordiall that ye bring a wretched Lady
A woman lost among ye laught at scornd
I will not wish ye halfe my miseries
I haue more Charity But say I warnd ye
Take heed for heauens sake take heed least at once
The burthen of my sorrowes fall vpon ye

 Car Madam this is a meere distraction
You turne the good we offer into enuy

 Quee Ye turne me into nothing Woe vpon ye
And all such false Professors Would you haue me
If you haue any Iustice any Pitty
If ye be any thing but Churchmens habits
Put my sicke cause into his hands that hates me
Alas has banishd me his Bed already
His Loue too long ago I am old my Lords
And all the Fellowship I hold now with him
Is onely my Obedience What can happen
To me aboue this wretchednesse All your Studies
Make me a Curse like this

 Camp Your feares are worse

 Qu Haue I liud thus long let me speake my selfe
Since Vertue findes no friends a Wife a true one
A Woman I dare say without Vainglory
Neuer yet branded with Suspition
Haue I with all my full Affections
Still met the King Loud him next Heaun Obeyd him
Bin out of fondnesse superstitious to him
Almost forgot my Prayres to content him
And am I thus rewarded Tis not well Lords
Bring me a constant woman to her Husband
One that nere dreamd a Ioy beyond his pleasure
And to that Woman when she has done most
Yet will I adde an Honor a great Patience

 Car Madam you wander from the good
We ayme at

 Qu My Lord
I dare not make my selfe so guiltie
To giue vp willingly that Noble Title
Your Master wed me to nothing but death
Shall ere diuorce my Dignities

 Car Pray heare me

 Qu Would I had neuer trod this English Earth
Or felt the Flatteries that grow vpon it
Ye haue Angels Faces but Heauen knowes your hearts
What will become of me now wretched Lady
I am the most vnhappy Woman liuing
Alas poore Wenches where are now your Fortunes
Shipwrackd vpon a Kingdome where no Pitty
No Friends no Hope no Kindred weepe for me
Almost no Graue allowd me Like the Lilly
That once was Mistris of the Field and flourishd
Ile hang my head and perish

 Car If your Grace
Could but be brought to know our Ends are honest
Yould feele more comfort Why shold we good Lady
Vpon what cause wrong you Alas our Places
The way of our Profession is against it
We are to Cure such sorrowes not to sowe em
For Goodnesse sake consider what you do
How you may hurt your selfe I vtterly
Grow from the Kings Acquaintance by this Carriage
The hearts of Princes kisse Obedience
So much they loue it But to stubborne Spirits
They swell and grow as terrible as stormes
I know you haue a Gentle Noble temper
A Soule as euen as a Calme Pray thinke vs
Those we professe Peacemakers Friends and Seruants

 Camp Madam youl finde it so
You wrong your Vertues
With these weake Womens feares A Noble Spirit
As yours was put into you euer casts
Such doubts as false Coine from it The King loues you
Beware you loose it not For vs if you please
To trust vs in your businesse we are ready
To vse our vtmost Studies in your seruice

 Qu Do what ye will my Lords
And pray forgiue me
If I haue vsd my selfe vnmannerly
You know I am a Woman lacking wit
To make a seemely answer to such persons
Pray do my seruice to his Maiestie
He has my heart yet and shall haue my Prayers
While I shall haue my life Come reuerend Fathers
Bestow your Councels on me She now begges
That little thought when she set footing heere
She should haue bought her Dignities so deere

Enter King reading of a Scedule

 Sur I would twer somthing y would fret the string
The Mastercord ons heart

 Suf The King the King

 King What piles of wealth hath he accumulated
To his owne portion And what expence byth houre
Seemes to flow from him How ith name of Thrift
Does he rake this together Now my Lords
Saw you the Cardinall
 Nor My Lord we haue
Stood heere obseruing him Some strange Commotion
Is in his braine He bites his lip and starts
Stops on a sodaine lookes vpon the ground
Then layes his finger on his Temple straight
Springs out into fast gate then stops againe
Strikes his brest hard and anon he casts
His eye against the Moone in most strange Postures
We haue seene him set himselfe

 King It may well be
There is a mutiny ins minde This morning
Papers of State he sent me to peruse
As I requird and wot you what I found
There on my Conscience put vnwittingly
Forsooth an Inuentory thus importing
The seuerall parcels of his Plate his Treasure
Rich Stuffes and Ornaments of Houshold which
I finde at such proud Rate that it outspeakes
Possession of a Subiect

 Nor Its Heauens will
Some Spirit put this paper in the Packet
To blesse your eye withall

 King If we did thinke
His Contemplation were aboue the earth
And fixt on Spirituall obiect he should still
Dwell in his Musings but I am affraid
His Thinkings are below the Moone not worth
His serious considering

King takes his Seat whispers Louell who goes to the Cardinall

 Car Heauen forgiue me
Euer God blesse your Highnesse

 King Good my Lord
You are full of Heauenly stuffe and beare the Inuentory
Of your best Graces in your minde the which
You were now running ore you haue scarse time
To steale from Spirituall leysure a briefe span
To keepe your earthly Audit sure in that
I deeme you an ill Husband and am glad
To haue you therein my Companion

 Car Sir
For Holy Offices I haue a time a time
To thinke vpon the part of businesse which
I beare ith State and Nature does require
Her times of preseruation which perforce
I her fraile sonne amongst my Brethren mortall
Must giue my tendance to

 King You haue said well

 Car And euer may your Highnesse yoake together
As I will lend you cause my doing well
With my well saying

 King Tis well said agen
And tis a kinde of good deede to say well
And yet words are no deeds My Father loud you
He said he did and with his deed did Crowne
His word vpon you Since I had my Office
I haue kept you next my Heart haue not alone
Imployd you where high Profits might come home
But pard my present Hauings to bestow
My Bounties vpon you

 Car What should this meane
 Sur The Lord increase this businesse

 King Haue I not made you
The prime man of the State I pray you tell me
If what I now pronounce you haue found true
And if you may confesse it say withall
If you are bound to vs or no What say you
 Car My Soueraigne I confesse your Royall graces
Showrd on me daily haue bene more then could
My studied purposes requite which went
Beyond all mans endeauors My endeauors
Haue euer come too short of my Desires
Yet filld with my Abilities Mine owne ends
Haue beene mine so that euermore they pointed
Toth good of your most Sacred Person and
The profit of the State For your great Graces
Heapd vpon me poore Vndeseruer I
Can nothing render but Allegiant thankes
My Prayres to heauen for you my Loyaltie
Which euer has and euer shall be growing
Till death that Winter kill it

 King Fairely answerd
A Loyall and obedient Subiect is
Therein illustrated the Honor of it
Does pay the Act of it as ith contrary
The fowlenesse is the punishment I presume
That as my hand has opend Bounty to you
My heart dropd Loue my powre raind Honor more
On you then any So your Hand and Heart
Your Braine and euery Function of your power
Should notwithstanding that your bond of duty
As twer in Loues particular be more
To me your Friend then any

 Car I do professe
That for your Highnesse good I euer labourd
More then mine owne that am haue and will be
Though all the world should cracke their duty to you
And throw it from their Soule though perils did
Abound as thicke as thought could make em and
Appeare in formes more horrid yet my Duty
As doth a Rocke against the chiding Flood
Should the approach of this wilde Riuer breake
And stand vnshaken yours

 King Tis Nobly spoken
Take notice Lords he has a Loyall brest
For you haue seene him opent Read ore this
And after this and then to Breakfast with
What appetite you haue

Exit King frowning vpon the Cardinall the Nobles throng after
him
smiling and whispering

 Car What should this meane
What sodaine Angers this How haue I reapd it
He parted Frowning from me as if Ruine
Leapd from his Eyes So lookes the chafed Lyon
Vpon the daring Huntsman that has galld him
Then makes him nothing I must reade this paper
I feare the Story of his Anger Tis so
This paper has vndone me Tis th Accompt
Of all that world of Wealth I haue drawne together
For mine owne ends Indeed to gaine the Popedome
And fee my Friends in Rome O Negligence
Fit for a Foole to fall by What crosse Diuell
Made me put this maine Secret in the Packet
I sent the King Is there no way to cure this
No new deuice to beate this from his Braines
I know twill stirre him strongly yet I know
A way if it take right in spight of Fortune
Will bring me off againe Whats this To th Pope
The Letter as I liue with all the Businesse
I writ toos Holinesse Nay then farewell
I haue touchd the highest point of all my Greatnesse
And from that full Meridian of my Glory
I haste now to my Setting I shall fall
Like a bright exhalation in the Euening
And no man see me more
Enter to Woolsey the Dukes of Norfolke and Suffolke the Earle
of Surrey
and the Lord Chamberlaine

 Nor Heare the Kings pleasure Cardinall
Who commands you
To render vp the Great Seale presently
Into our hands and to Confine your selfe
To Asherhouse my Lord of Winchesters
Till you heare further from his Highnesse

 Car Stay
Wheres your Commission Lords words cannot carrie
Authority so weighty

 Suf Who dare crosse em
Bearing the Kings will from his mouth expressely
 Car Till I finde more then will or words to do it
I meane your malice know Officious Lords
I dare and must deny it Now I feele
Of what course Mettle ye are molded Enuy
How eagerly ye follow my Disgraces
As if it fed ye and how sleeke and wanton
Ye appeare in euery thing may bring my ruine
Follow your enuious courses men of Malice
You haue Christian warrant for em and no doubt
In time will finde their fit Rewards That Seale
You aske with such a Violence the King
Mine and your Master with his owne hand gaue me
Bad me enioy it with the Place and Honors
During my life and to confirme his Goodnesse
Tide it by Letters Patents Now wholl take it
 Sur The King that gaue it

 Car It must be himselfe then

 Sur Thou art a proud Traitor Priest

 Car Proud Lord thou lyest
Within these fortie houres Surrey durst better
Haue burnt that Tongue then saide so

 Sur Thy Ambition
Thou Scarlet sinne robbd this bewailing Land
Of Noble Buckingham my FatherinLaw
The heads of all thy BrotherCardinals
With thee and all thy best parts bound together
Weighd not a haire of his Plague of your policie
You sent me Deputie for Ireland
Farre from his succour from the King from all
That might haue mercie on the fault thou gaust him
Whilst your great Goodnesse out of holy pitty
Absolud him with an Axe

 Wol This and all else
This talking Lord can lay vpon my credit
I answer is most false The Duke by Law
Found his deserts How innocent I was
From any priuate malice in his end
His Noble Iurie and foule Cause can witnesse
If I loud many words Lord I should tell you
You haue as little Honestie as Honor
That in the way of Loyaltie and Truth
Toward the King my euer Roiall Master
Dare mate a sounder man then Surrie can be
And all that loue his follies

 Sur By my Soule
Your long Coat Priest protects you
Thou shouldst feele
My Sword ith life blood of thee else My Lords
Can ye endure to heare this Arrogance
And from this Fellow If we liue thus tamely
To be thus Iaded by a peece of Scarlet
Farewell Nobilitie let his Grace go forward
And dare vs with his Cap like Larkes

 Card All Goodnesse
Is poyson to thy Stomacke

 Sur Yes that goodnesse
Of gleaning all the Lands wealth into one
Into your owne hands Cardnall by Extortion
The goodnesse of your intercepted Packets
You writ toth Pope against the King your goodnesse
Since you prouoke me shall be most notorious
My Lord of Norfolke as you are truly Noble
As you respect the common good the State
Of our despisd Nobilitie our Issues
Whom if he liue will scarse be Gentlemen
Produce the grand summe of his sinnes the Articles
Collected from his life Ile startle you
Worse then the Sacring Bell when the browne Wench
Lay kissing in your Armes Lord Cardinall

 Car How much me thinkes I could despise this man
But that I am bound in Charitie against it

 Nor Those Articles my Lord are in the Kings hand
But thus much they are foule ones

 Wol So much fairer
And spotlesse shall mine Innocence arise
When the King knowes my Truth

 Sur This cannot saue you
I thanke my Memorie I yet remember
Some of these Articles and out they shall
Now if you can blush and crie guiltie Cardinall
Youl shew a little Honestie

 Wol Speake on Sir
I dare your worst Obiections If I blush
It is to see a Nobleman want manners

 Sur I had rather want those then my head
Haue at you
First that without the Kings assent or knowledge
You wrought to be a Legate by which power
You maimd the Iurisdiction of all Bishops

 Nor Then That in all you writ to Rome or else
To Forraigne Princes Ego  Rex meus
Was still inscribd in which you brought the King
To be your Seruant

 Suf Then that without the knowledge
Either of King or Councell when you went
Ambassador to the Emperor you made bold
To carry into Flanders the Great Seale


 Sur Item You sent a large Commission
To Gregory de Cassado to conclude
Without the Kings will or the States allowance
A League betweene his Highnesse and Ferrara

 Suf That out of meere Ambition you haue causd
Your holyHat to be stampt on the Kings Coine

 Sur Then That you haue sent inumerable substance
By what meanes got I leaue to your owne conscience
To furnish Rome and to prepare the wayes
You haue for Dignities to the meere vndooing
Of all the Kingdome Many more there are
Which since they are of you and odious
I will not taint my mouth with

 Cham O my Lord
Presse not a falling man too farre tis Vertue
His faults lye open to the Lawes let them
Not you correct him My heart weepes to see him
So little of his great Selfe

 Sur I forgiue him

 Suf Lord Cardinall the Kings further pleasure is
Because all those things you haue done of late
By your power Legatine within this Kingdome
Fall into th compasse of a Premunire
That therefore such a Writ be sued against you
To forfeit all your Goods Lands Tenements
Castles and whatsoeuer and to be
Out of the Kings protection This is my Charge

 Nor And so weel leaue you to your Meditations
How to liue better For your stubborne answer
About the giuing backe the Great Seale to vs
The King shall know it and no doubt shal thanke you
So fare you well my little good Lord Cardinall

Exeunt all but Wolsey

 Wol So farewell to the little good you beare me
Farewell A long farewell to all my Greatnesse
This is the state of Man to day he puts forth
The tender Leaues of hopes to morrow Blossomes
And beares his blushing Honors thicke vpon him
The third day comes a Frost a killing Frost
And when he thinkes good easie man full surely
His Greatnesse is a ripening nippes his roote
And then he fals as I do I haue venturd
Like little wanton Boyes that swim on bladders
This many Summers in a Sea of Glory
But farre beyond my depth my highblowne Pride
At length broke vnder me and now has left me
Weary and old with Seruice to the mercy
Of a rude streame that must for euer hide me
Vaine pompe and glory of this World I hate ye
I feele my heart new opend Oh how wretched
Is that poore man that hangs on Princes fauours
There is betwixt that smile we would aspire too
That sweet Aspect of Princes and their ruine
More pangs and feares then warres or women haue
And when he falles he falles like Lucifer
Neuer to hope againe
Enter Cromwell standing amazed

Why how now Cromwell
 Crom I haue no power to speake Sir

 Car What amazd
At my misfortunes Can thy Spirit wonder
A great man should decline Nay and you weep
I am falne indeed

 Crom How does your Grace

 Card Why well
Neuer so truly happy my good Cromwell
I know my selfe now and I feele within me
A peace aboue all earthly Dignities
A still and quiet Conscience The King has curd me
I humbly thanke his Grace and from these shoulders
These ruind Pillers out of pitty taken
A loade would sinke a Nauy too much Honor
O tis a burden Cromwel tis a burden
Too heauy for a man that hopes for Heauen

 Crom I am glad your Grace
Has made that right vse of it

 Card I hope I haue
I am able now me thinkes
Out of a Fortitude of Soule I feele
To endure more Miseries and greater farre
Then my Weakehearted Enemies dare offer
What Newes abroad
 Crom The heauiest and the worst
Is your displeasure with the King

 Card God blesse him

 Crom The next is that Sir Thomas Moore is chosen
Lord Chancellor in your place

 Card Thats somewhat sodain
But hes a Learned man May he continue
Long in his Highnesse fauour and do Iustice
For Truthssake and his Conscience that his bones
When he has run his course and sleepes in Blessings
May haue a Tombe of Orphants teares wept on him
What more
 Crom That Cranmer is returnd with welcome
Installd Lord Archbyshop of Canterbury

 Card Thats Newes indeed

 Crom Last that the Lady Anne
Whom the King hath in secrecie long married
This day was viewd in open as his Queene
Going to Chappell and the voyce is now
Onely about her Corronation

 Card There was the waight that pulld me downe
O Cromwell
The King has gone beyond me All my Glories
In that one woman I haue lost for euer
No Sun shall euer vsher forth mine Honors
Or gilde againe the Noble Troopes that waighted
Vpon my smiles Go get thee from me Cromwel
I am a poore falne man vnworthy now
To be thy Lord and Master Seeke the King
That Sun I pray may neuer set I haue told him
What and how true thou art he will aduance thee
Some little memory of me will stirre him
I know his Noble Nature not to let
Thy hopefull seruice perish too Good Cromwell
Neglect him not make vse now and prouide
For thine owne future safety

 Crom O my Lord
Must I then leaue you Must I needes forgo
So good so Noble and so true a Master
Beare witnesse all that haue not hearts of Iron
With what a sorrow Cromwel leaues his Lord
The King shall haue my seruice but my prayres
For euer and for euer shall be yours

 Card Cromwel I did not thinke to shed a teare
In all my Miseries But thou hast forcd me
Out of thy honest truth to play the Woman
Lets dry our eyes And thus farre heare me Cromwel
And when I am forgotten as I shall be
And sleepe in dull cold Marble where no mention
Of me more must be heard of Say I taught thee
Say Wolsey that once trod the wayes of Glory
And sounded all the Depths and Shoales of Honor
Found thee a way out of his wracke to rise in
A sure and safe one though thy Master mist it
Marke but my Fall and that that Ruind me
Cromwel I charge thee fling away Ambition
By that sinne fell the Angels how can man then
The Image of his Maker hope to win by it
Loue thy selfe last cherish those hearts that hate thee
Corruption wins not more then Honesty
Still in thy right hand carry gentle Peace
To silence enuious Tongues Be iust and feare not
Let all the ends thou aymst at be thy Countries
Thy Gods and Truths Then if thou fallst O Cromwell
Thou fallst a blessed Martyr
Serue the King And prythee leade me in
There take an Inuentory of all I haue
To the last peny tis the Kings My Robe
And my Integrity to Heauen is all
I dare now call mine owne O Cromwel Cromwel
Had I but serud my God with halfe the Zeale
I serud my King he would not in mine Age
Haue left me naked to mine Enemies

 Crom Good Sir haue patience

 Card So I haue Farewell
The Hopes of Court my Hopes in Heauen do dwell

Exeunt

Of Lords and Ladies hauing brought the Queene
To a prepard place in the Quire fell off
A distance from her while her Grace sate downe
To rest a while some halfe an houre or so
In a rich Chaire of State opposing freely
The Beauty of her Person to the People
Beleeue me Sir she is the goodliest Woman
That euer lay by man which when the people
Had the full view of such a noyse arose
As the shrowdes make at Sea in a stiffe Tempest
As lowd and to as many Tunes Hats Cloakes
Doublets I thinke flew vp and had their Faces
Bin loose this day they had beene lost Such ioy
I neuer saw before Great bellyd women

And make em reele before em No man liuing
Could say this is my wife there all were wouen
So strangely in one peece

Came to the Altar where she kneeld and Saintlike
Cast her faire eyes to Heauen and prayd deuoutly

Laid Nobly on her which performd the Quire
With all the choysest Musicke of the Kingdome
Together sung Te Deum So she parted

Scena Secunda

Gentleman
Vsher and Patience her Woman

 Grif How dos your Grace
 Kath O Griffith sicke to death
My Legges like loaden Branches bow toth Earth
Willing to leaue their burthen Reach a Chaire
So now me thinkes I feele a little ease
Didst thou not tell me Griffith as thou leadst mee
That the great Childe of Honor Cardinall Wolsey
Was dead
 Grif Yes Madam but I thinke your Grace
Out of the paine you sufferd gaue no eare toot

 Kath Prethee good Griffith tell me how he dyde
If well he stept before me happily
For my example

 Grif Well the voyce goes Madam
For after the stout Earle Northumberland
Arrested him at Yorke and brought him forward
As a man sorely tainted to his Answer
He fell sicke sodainly and grew so ill
He could not sit his Mule

 Kath Alas poore man

 Grif At last with easie Rodes he came to Leicester
Lodgd in the Abbey where the reuerend Abbot
With all his Couent honourably receiud him
To whom he gaue these words O Father Abbot
An old man broken with the stormes of State
Is come to lay his weary bones among ye
Giue him a little earth for Charity
So went to bed where eagerly his sicknesse
Pursud him still and three nights after this
About the houre of eight which he himselfe
Foretold should be his last full of Repentance
Continuall Meditations Teares and Sorrowes
He gaue his Honors to the world agen
His blessed part to Heauen and slept in peace

 Kath So may he rest
His Faults lye gently on him
Yet thus farre Griffith giue me leaue to speake him
And yet with Charity He was a man
Of an vnbounded stomacke euer ranking
Himselfe with Princes One that by suggestion
Tyde all the Kingdome Symonie was faire play
His owne Opinion was his Law Ith presence
He would say vntruths and be euer double
Both in his words and meaning He was neuer
But where he meant to Ruine pittifull
His Promises were as he then was Mighty
But his performance as he is now Nothing
Of his owne body he was ill and gaue
The Clergy ill example

 Grif Noble Madam
Mens euill manners liue in Brasse their Vertues
We write in Water May it please your Highnesse
To heare me speake his good now
 Kath Yes good Griffith
I were malicious else

 Grif This Cardinall
Though from an humble Stocke vndoubtedly
Was fashiond to much Honor From his Cradle
He was a Scholler and a ripe and good one
Exceeding wise faire spoken and perswading
Lofty and sowre to them that loud him not
But to those men that sought him sweet as Summer
And though he were vnsatisfied in getting
Which was a sinne yet in bestowing Madam
He was most Princely Euer witnesse for him
Those twinnes of Learning that he raisd in you
Ipswich and Oxford one of which fell with him
Vnwilling to outliue the good that did it
The other though vnfinishd yet so Famous
So excellent in Art and still so rising
That Christendome shall euer speake his Vertue
His Ouerthrow heapd Happinesse vpon him
For then and not till then he felt himselfe
And found the Blessednesse of being little
And to adde greater Honors to his Age
Then man could giue him he dyde fearing God

 Kath After my death I wish no other Herald
No other speaker of my liuing Actions
To keepe mine Honor from Corruption
But such an honest Chronicler as Griffith
Whom I most hated Liuing thou hast made mee
With thy Religious Truth and Modestie
Now in his Ashes Honor Peace be with him
Patience be neere me still and set me lower
I haue not long to trouble thee Good Griffith
Cause the Musitians play me that sad note
I namd my Knell whilst I sit meditating
On that Coelestiall Harmony I go too

Sad and solemne Musicke

 Grif She is asleep Good wench lets sit down quiet
For feare we wake her Softly gentle Patience

The Vision Enter solemnely tripping one after another sixe
Personages

Vizards on their faces Branches of Bayes or Palme in their hands

inspiration she makes in her sleepe signes of reioycing and

 Kath Spirits of peace where are ye Are ye all gone
And leaue me heere in wretchednesse behinde ye

 Kath It is not you I call for
Saw ye none enter since I slept
 Grif None Madam

 Kath No Saw you not euen now a blessed Troope
Inuite me to a Banquet whose bright faces
Cast thousand beames vpon me like the Sun
They promisd me eternall Happinesse
And brought me Garlands Griffith which I feele
I am not worthy yet to weare I shall assuredly

 Grif I am most ioyfull Madam such good dreames
Possesse your Fancy

 Kath Bid the Musicke leaue
They are harsh and heauy to me

Musicke ceases

 Pati Do you note
How much her Grace is alterd on the sodaine
How long her face is drawne How pale she lookes

And heartily entreats you take good comfort

 Kath O my good Lord that comfort comes too late
Tis like a Pardon after Execution
That gentle Physicke giuen in time had curd me
But now I am past all Comforts heere but Prayers
How does his Highnesse
 Cap Madam in good health

 Kath So may he euer do and euer flourish
When I shall dwell with Wormes and my poore name
Banishd the Kingdome Patience is that Letter
I causd you write yet sent away
 Pat No Madam

 Kath Sir I most humbly pray you to deliuer
This to my Lord the King

 Cap Most willing Madam

 Kath In which I haue commended to his goodnesse
The Modell of our chaste loues his yong daughter
The dewes of Heauen fall thicke in Blessings on her
Beseeching him to giue her vertuous breeding
She is yong and of a Noble modest Nature
I hope she will deserue well and a little
To loue her for her Mothers sake that loud him
Heauen knowes how deerely
My next poore Petition
Is that his Noble Grace would haue some pittie
Vpon my wretched women that so long
Haue followd both my Fortunes faithfully
Of which there is not one I dare auow
And now I should not lye but will deserue
For Vertue and true Beautie of the Soule
For honestie and decent Carriage
A right good Husband let him be a Noble
And sure those men are happy that shall haue em
The last is for my men they are the poorest
But pouerty could neuer draw em from me
That they may haue their wages duly paid em
And something ouer to remember me by
If Heauen had pleasd to haue giuen me longer life
And able meanes we had not parted thus
These are the whole Contents and good my Lord
By that you loue the deerest in this world
As you wish Christian peace to soules departed
Stand these poore peoples Friend and vrge the King
To do me this last right

 Cap By Heauen I will
Or let me loose the fashion of a man

 Kath I thanke you honest Lord Remember me
In all humilitie vnto his Highnesse
Say his long trouble now is passing
Out of this world Tell him in death I blest him
For so I will mine eyes grow dimme Farewell
My Lord Griffith farewell Nay Patience
You must not leaue me yet I must to bed
Call in more women When I am dead good Wench
Let me be vsd with Honor strew me ouer
With Maiden Flowers that all the world may know
I was a chaste Wife to my Graue Embalme me
Then lay me forth although vnqueend yet like
A Queene and Daughter to a King enterre me
I can no more

To quench mine Honor they would shame to make me
Wait else at doore a fellow Councellor
Mong Boyes Groomes and Lackeyes
But their pleasures
Must be fulfilld and I attend with patience
Enter the King and Buts at a Windowe aboue

Who holds his State at dore mongst Purseuants
Pages and Footboyes

 Kin Ha Tis he indeed
Is this the Honour they doe one another
Tis well theres one aboue em yet I had thought
They had parted so much honesty among em
At least good manners as not thus to suffer
A man of his Place and so neere our fauour
To dance attendance on their Lordships pleasures
And at the dore too like a Post with Packets
By holy Mary Butts theres knauery
Let em alone and draw the Curtaine close
We shall heare more anon

A Councell Table brought in with Chayres and Stooles and placed
vnder

 Crom Yes

 Norf Who waits there
 Keep Without my Noble Lords
 Gard Yes

 Keep My Lord Archbishop
And has done halfe an houre to know your pleasures

 Chan Let him come in

 Keep Your Grace may enter now

Cranmer approches the Councell Table

 Chan My good Lord Archbishop Im very sorry
To sit heere at this present and behold
That Chayre stand empty But we all are men
In our owne natures fraile and capable
Of our flesh few are Angels out of which frailty
And want of wisedome you that best should teach vs
Haue misdemeand your selfe and not a little
Toward the King first then his Lawes in filling
The whole Realme by your teaching  your Chaplaines
For so we are informd with new opinions
Diuers and dangerous which are Heresies
And not reformd may proue pernicious

 Gard Which Reformation must be sodaine too
My Noble Lords for those that tame wild Horses
Pace em not in their hands to make em gentle
But stop their mouthes with stubborn Bits  spurre em
Till they obey the mannage If we suffer
Out of our easinesse and childish pitty
To one mans Honour this contagious sicknesse
Farewell all Physicke and what followes then
Commotions vprores with a generall Taint
Of the whole State as of late dayes our neighbours
The vpper Germany can deerely witnesse
Yet freshly pittied in our memories

 Cran My good Lords Hitherto in all the Progresse
Both of my Life and Office I haue labourd
And with no little study that my teaching
And the strong course of my Authority
Might goe one way and safely and the end
Was euer to doe well nor is there liuing
I speake it with a single heart my Lords
A man that more detests more stirres against
Both in his priuate Conscience and his place
Defacers of a publique peace then I doe
Pray Heauen the King may neuer find a heart
With lesse Allegeance in it Men that make
Enuy and crooked malice nourishment
Dare bite the best I doe beseech your Lordships
That in this case of Iustice my Accusers
Be what they will may stand forth face to face
And freely vrge against me

 Suff Nay my Lord
That cannot be you are a Counsellor
And by that vertue no man dare accuse you

 Gard My Lord because we haue busines of more moment
We will be short with you Tis his Highnesse pleasure
And our consent for better tryall of you
From hence you be committed to the Tower
Where being but a priuate man againe
You shall know many dare accuse you boldly
More then I feare you are prouided for

 Cran Ah my good Lord of Winchester I thanke you
You are alwayes my good Friend if your will passe
I shall both finde your Lordship Iudge and Iuror
You are so mercifull I see your end
Tis my vndoing Loue and meekenesse Lord
Become a Churchman better then Ambition
Win straying Soules with modesty againe
Cast none away That I shall cleere my selfe
Lay all the weight ye can vpon my patience
I make as little doubt as you doe conscience
In doing dayly wrongs I could say more
But reuerence to your calling makes me modest

 Gard My Lord my Lord you are a Sectary
Thats the plaine truth your painted glosse discouers
To men that vnderstand you words and weaknesse

 Crom My Lord of Winchester yare a little
By your good fauour too sharpe Men so Noble
How euer faulty yet should finde respect
For what they haue beene tis a cruelty
To load a falling man

 Gard Good Master Secretary
I cry your Honour mercie you may worst
Of all this Table say so

 Crom Why my Lord
 Gard Doe not I know you for a Fauourer
Of this new Sect ye are not sound

 Crom Not sound
 Gard Not sound I say

 Crom Would you were halfe so honest
Mens prayers then would seeke you not their feares

 Gard I shall remember this bold Language

 Crom Doe
Remember your bold life too

 Cham This is too much
Forbeare for shame my Lords

 Gard I haue done

 Crom And I

 Cham Then thus for you my Lord it stands agreed
I take it by all voyces That forthwith
You be conuaid to th Tower a Prisoner
There to remaine till the Kings further pleasure
Be knowne vnto vs are you all agreed Lords

 All We are

 Cran Is there no other way of mercy
But I must needs to th Tower my Lords
 Gard What other
Would you expect You are strangely troublesome
Let some oth Guard be ready there
Enter the Guard

 Cran For me
Must I goe like a Traytor thither
 Gard Receiue him
And see him safe ith Tower

 Cran Stay good my Lords
I haue a little yet to say Looke there my Lords
By vertue of that Ring I take my cause
Out of the gripes of cruell men and giue it
To a most Noble Iudge the King my Maister

 Cham This is the Kings Ring

 Sur Tis no counterfeit

 Suff Ts the right Ring by Heaun I told ye all
When we first put this dangerous stone a rowling
Twold fall vpon our selues

 Norf Doe you thinke my Lords
The King will suffer but the little finger
Of this man to be vexd
 Cham Tis now too certaine
How much more is his Life in value with him
Would I were fairely out ont

 Crom My mind gaue me
In seeking tales and Informations
Against this man whose honesty the Diuell
And his Disciples onely enuy at
Ye blew the fire that burnes ye now haue at ye
Enter King frowning on them takes his Seate

 Gard Dread Soueraigne
How much are we bound to Heauen
In dayly thankes that gaue vs such a Prince
Not onely good and wise but most religious
One that in all obedience makes the Church
The cheefe ayme of his Honour and to strengthen
That holy duty out of deare respect
His Royall selfe in Iudgement comes to heare
The cause betwixt her and this great offender

 Kin You were euer good at sodaine Commendations
Bishop of Winchester But know I come not
To heare such flattery now and in my presence
They are too thin and base to hide offences
To me you cannot reach You play the Spaniell
And thinke with wagging of your tongue to win me
But whatsoere thou takst me for Im sure
Thou hast a cruell Nature and a bloody
Good man sit downe Now let me see the proudest
Hee that dares most but wag his finger at thee
By all thats holy he had better starue
Then but once thinke his place becomes thee not

 Sur May it please your Grace 
 Kin No Sir it does not please me
I had thought I had had men of some vnderstanding
And wisedome of my Councell but I finde none
Was it discretion Lords to let this man
This good man few of you deserue that Title
This honest man wait like a lowsie Footboy
At Chamber dore and one as great as you are
Why what a shame was this Did my Commission
Bid ye so farre forget your selues I gaue ye
Power as he was a Counsellour to try him
Not as a Groome Theres some of ye I see
More out of Malice then Integrity
Would trye him to the vtmost had ye meane
Which ye shall neuer haue while I liue

 Chan Thus farre
My most dread Soueraigne may it like your Grace
To let my tongue excuse all What was purposd
Concerning his Imprisonment was rather
If there be faith in men meant for his Tryall
And faire purgation to the world then malice
Im sure in me

 Kin Well well my Lords respect him
Take him and vse him well hees worthy of it
I will say thus much for him if a Prince
May be beholding to a Subiect I
Am for his loue and seruice so to him
Make me no more adoe but all embrace him
Be friends for shame my Lords My Lord of Canterbury
I haue a Suite which you must not deny mee
That is a faire young Maid that yet wants Baptisme
You must be Godfather and answere for her

 Cran The greatest Monarch now aliue may glory
In such an honour how may I deserue it
That am a poore and humble Subiect to you
 Kin Come come my Lord youd spare your spoones
You shall haue two noble Partners with you the old
Duchesse of Norfolke and Lady Marquesse Dorset will
these please you
Once more my Lord of Winchester I charge you
Embrace and loue this man

 Gard With a true heart
And Brother loue I doe it

 Cran And let Heauen
Witnesse how deare I hold this Confirmation

 Kin Good Man those ioyfull teares shew thy true hearts
The common voyce I see is verified
Of thee which sayes thus Doe my Lord of Canterbury
A shrewd turne and hees your friend for euer
Come Lords we trifle time away I long
To haue this young one made a Christian
As I haue made ye one Lords one remaine
So I grow stronger you more Honour gaine
