DOWN THE MOTHER LODE

PIONEER TALES OF CALIFORNIA


By Vivia Hemphill

Copyright 1922




Foreword


So many inquiries have been made as to exactly where and what is the
Mother Lode

The geologist and the historian agree as to its location and
composition but the old miners and sojourners of the vanished golden
era give strangely different versions of it Some of these are here
set down if not all for your enlightenment at least I hope for your
entertainment

That is after all the principal aim of these tales of the old days in
California that are gone for good Mark Twain says in his preface
to Roughing It that there is a great deal of information in his work
which he regrets very much but which really could not be helped as
information seems to stew out of me naturally like the precious ottar
of roses out of the otter

These stories make no such particular claim They are merely historical
fragments of their everyday life gathered from a passing generation
before they shall be finally lost Each one is based upon truth
Somewhere sometime some place certain characters lived the scenes and
actions here described

The title Mother Lode has been used in its broader sense as
exemplifying the source of all gold in California and the life which
arose from it

The mining engineer said The Mother Lode runs south from El Dorado
County to the lower boundary of Mariposa County It stretches past the
towns of Sutter Creek Jackson San Andreas Angels Camp and the road
to Yosemite far down below Coulterville The lode begins suddenly and
ends as suddenly and though we have searched up and down the state we
have never been able to pick it up again

Has it any relation to the Comstock Lode was asked

None whatever Curiously enough in Nevada City and vicinity it would
appear that at one time in the earths making a great fissure opened in
forming California and a wedge of Nevada mining country was pushed into
it North of there the California stratas begin again

But it was always my belief that these localities were on the Mother
Lode as well as the Georgetown and Auburn country

Many persons are apparently under that impression but the geological
surveys of the government place it in the exact location I have given
you

The Old Miner 49er said We hunted most all o our lives lookin
for her We called her the Mother Lode because we thought that all the
gold in the state must a come from her an washed down the rivers onto
the bars where we found it We thought shed be pure gold an a hundred
feet wide an go on world without end We looked an looked an after
quartz minin come in we dug an dug but we never found the old girl
exceptin here an there

Joe Dance that old prospector that died last year he lost his mind
lookin for the big lode Made some rich strikes in his day Joe did
but he never could stop to work em He was always waitin for the
mother of em all he said whod put him on the road to the heart a
molten gold in the middle a the earth

We old fellows tramped all the way through the hills with only a burro
for company most a the time an youll ride down a broad paved way
soon in your automobile Youll go in days where it took us months
an some brainy young engineer will locate the old girl most likely in
newfangled ways that were unknown in our time

Well the world whirls fast nowadays Guess theyll need all the
gold in the old girls lap to keep on greasin the machinery I take off
my hat to this generation I hope theyll find it

Hittell says The Mother Lode is one of the most extraordinary
metalliferous veins in the world Goldbearing lodes usually range only
five or six miles but this can be traced for more than sixty The rock
is a hard and white quartz rich in very fine particles of gold and the
vein varies in width from a foot to thirty feet

There are in some portions of its course side branches or companion
veins as they are sometimes called making the total width nearly one
hundred feet Nor is the direction of the lode always in a straight
line Though usually found within half a mile of what may be considered
its normal course it is sometimes found as far as two or three miles
from it and there are cases of other lodes three in all entirely
distinct which in some instances approach so close as to be confounded
with it

There are numerous mines along the whole length of the lode famous for
having yielded their millions One quartz ledge is said to have yielded
for a long time twothirds gold They say of the Morgan Mine at
Carsons Creek near Melones It appeared to be rich beyond parallel
On one occasion 11000000 worth of gold was thrown down at a single
blast

Many expeditions were made in search of the fabled Great Lode but all
attempts were vain

The old spreadeagle judge said Yes sir the Mother Lode dips up in
a bit of a circle with no beginning and no end in the western foothills
of the Sierra Mountains Down about Melones and Sonora and Angels
Camp it goes and through Table Mountain and under Jackass Hill It
comes north and north past Coloma and Auburn to Nevada City and then
it disappears

I remembered the engineers statement but was silent

It was the haunt of Harte and Twain and Canfield in the north it was
the bank of such men as Hopkins Crocker Huntington and Stanford the
foundation of one of the greatest states in the Union the Mother Lode
the Mother of Gold

Child my old eyes have watched it spread for nearly ninety yearsthe
power of gold and of the men who came to seek it The influence of gold
controlled by the human intellect I am old and tired and soon I
shall sleep but the old see clearly too clearly that which they are
leaving and that to which they pass

Thus facing the stars we go out amongst them into darkness I
quoted softly

Not to darkness but to eternal light to rise again from the Mother
Lode to mingle in the busy lives of men

Who maketh His messengers with two and three and four pairs of
wings

Exactly To be born again and yet again The real mothervein of gold
was imbued in the men shaped by the life of the frontier It was
the cornerstone of great fortunes of families of enterprises of
achievements which are peculiarly Californias own

It was the clearing house and open sesame of the vast trade of the
Orient which is just coming into being the foundation for the bridge
of gold which shall reach across the seas a fit monument to posterity
which shall be erected with all the lightness and grace and stability
of the present cultured generations born with their feet in the flowers
grown from the mothergold of decent manhood and glorious womanhoodthe
precious metals of the spirit unalloyed and unafraid

They are the true Mother Lode the bourne of the seekers of gold
greater far than the crazed brains of the old prospectors had the
power to conceive A furtherreaching broader arc than the most
wondrous rainbow of their imaginings born of dreams and built of hunger
and despair

So shall we find at last the Mother Lode the virginity of the
essence of creation the beginning and the end The curve of the circle
which is unchanging insoluble omniscient which shall return to that
which created it which is all which is God



 49

 We have worked our claims
 We have spent our gold
 Our barks are astrand on the bars
 We are battered and old
 Yet at night we behold
 Outcroppings of gold in the stars

 Where the rabbits play
 Where the quail all day
 Pipe on the chaparral hill
 A few more days
 And the last of us lays
 His pick aside and is still

 We are wreck and stray
 We are cast away
 Poor battered old hulks and spars
 But we hope and pray
 On the judgment Day
 We shall strike it up in the stars

One Sunday in Stinsons Bar

I

 On that broad stage of empire won
 Whose footlights were the setting sun
 Whose flats a distant background rose
 In trackless peaks of endless snows
 Here genius bows and talent waits
 To copy that but One creates

 Bret Harte



Nowadays when you want to go from San Francisco to the Sierra Nevada
country you step into your perfectly good Packard or whatever it
isall the way down to a motorcycle side car and you ferry across
the bay and the straits and if the motorcop isnt around you come
shooting up the highway forty miles an hour and at the end of a
glorious fivehour run you are there

In the early fiftieswhen there was less to see tooyou took more
time to it You came to Sacramento on the river boat Then if you
were rich you bought a horse or a mule and rode for the rest of your
journey If you were poor or thrifty perhaps you walked or tried to
get a ride on one of the oxfreight teams which plied their way across
Haggin Grant to Auburn and Dutch Flat or to Folsom and Coloma

Later a railway was built as far as Auburn station then situated at a
point three miles east of Loomis which was at that time called Pino

Nothing remains of Auburn station But the road bed of the old railway
is still to be found in certain wooded tracts which have not given way
to the fruit ranches and the highway from Fair Oaks into Folsom follows
the old cuts and grades for several miles

In the days preceding and immediately following the discovery of gold
in California building was very difficult Every stick of lumber in my
grandfathers house came by ship around the Horn and the fruit trees
grape vines flowers even bees for his lovely garden were all sent
from Europe

In the smaller settlements there was seldom more than one large building
which could be used for social purposes and this was often the card
room or bar room in connection with the hotel of the town

So here is the tale that was told of one Sunday in Stinsons bar room
in the late 50s at Auburn Station

They tried to give a ball once a year at Stinsons Persons came to it
from 30 miles about particularly if they were women and every woman
divided each dance among four men When a man invited a lady to come to
a dance in many instances he insisted upon the privilege of buying her
a silken gown and slippers to wear and this was not considered unusual
nor was she in any way obligated to him for it There were so few
ladies that they were treated as little short of divinities

This Saturday night there had been no dance and the men at Gentleman
Jacks table at Stinsons had played threecard monte on through the
dawn and the sunrise and into broad daylight The door was pushed open
letting in a rush of cool sweet air which guttered the candles set
in old bottles and drove the heavy fog of tobacco smoke toward the
blackened ceiling A voice boomed forth

Come on now gentlemen Two ladies have come with posies in tall
silver vases and a white altar cloth for this table The preachers
coming over from Folsom and there will be church held here in one hour
Hes a busy man today An infant will be given a license to travel the
long and uncertain road to heaven and a pair of happy lovers will be
made one

Oneunhappy pair

Its William Duncan Hes intoxicated again drawled Gentleman Jack
stretching his graceful length and smiling at a long aristocratic
figure crouched over a small table in a corner His last strike turned
out to be only a small pocket and so he drowns his woes in liquor as
usual He bowed to his recent card partners Gentlemen I am sincerely
sorry for your losses this night I shall sleep an hour before the holy
man arrives He sauntered out stuffing a buckskin bag of gold dust into
his pocket

There lies my pocketin his pocket muttered Duncan No Stinson
raising his voice authoritatively I shall not go out It is my
desire to pray for my sins today    and there has a letter come from
overseas which I must readif I can If I can

In an hour the room was cleared of smoke greasy cards poker chips
and empty bottles The bar was in a small room apart The poker table
supplemented with a box was covered with a handsome altar cloth flanked
by huge silver candlesticks and vases which had been carried across
the plains Every individual in the community came to church and stayed
afterward for the christening At least twenty men expressed a wish to
be godfather to the baby and the proud mother accepted all offers
When the christening was over William Duncan lurched to his feet his
highbred face full of tenderness his longfingered fine grained hands
poised over the rosy child while he quoted

May time who sheds his blight oer all And daily dooms some joy to
death Oer thee let years so gently fall They shall not crush one
flower beneath

Ah here comes the bride All the worlds a stage Let us on with
the next scene and he reeled back to his little table in the corner

The kissing and congratulations after the wedding were interrupted by
the shouts of a man on horseback and riding hard

Wheres the minister Send for Doc Miller That beast of a Mexican
horse thiefhe shot Jim Muldoon down at Doltons Bar Jim caught hes
stealing his horse and Im afraid the dirty greasers killed him We got
im though before he skipped Somebody go down to Rattlesnake for Doc
Miller Theyre bringing em both here

When Doc Miller saw Muldoon stretched on the barroom table the same
table which a few minutes before had served as an altar he shook his
head

He will be gone in half an hour he said The men standing about began
taking off their hats

I wish to write home whispered Muldoon The young mother handed
her baby to its father and seizing pencil and paper ran forward The
minister opened his prayer book at the service for the dying

When that service had been read and what had been Muldoon carried away
to be made ready for the last sleep only the minister and the tall
Englishman were left in the barroom

In the midst of life we are in death muttered Duncan

True rebuked the other so live well the life which the Lord thy
God hath provided thee Will Duncan laughed aloud

It is too late ManoGod There is no place in the world for a
younger son The minister had not heard He sprang toward the open
window calling

Wait It is writtenThou shalt not kill Bring him in like just and
honest men for a hearing He may be a horse thief and a murderer but
you shall take the rope from his neck and he shall speak in his own
defense before he goes to his Maker

So a hearing was given although grudgingly and with audible grumbling
by the friends of Muldoon across the table which had so lately been
his bier but in the end they took the Mexican out for the shortcut to
retribution

Two hours later around the same table was solemnized the funeral
service of Jim Muldoon The minister would not return for six weeks
It must be held at once Gentleman Jack gave a suit of finest black
broadcloth for a shroud and the little bride keeping one flower from
her wedding bouquet placed the rest in the dead mans hands She kissed
him softly on his forehead whispering through her tears For the ones
at home who loved you and stood watching as six men carried him away
to the tiny cemetery under the trees on a hill

Vesper services were over and the weary minister and his congregation
had gone before Duncan found courage to open and read his letter His
elder brother heir to the title and great houses and landed estates of
his family had been killed in the hunting field and he being next in
line was to come home to succeed to the position

He WilliamDuncanClaibourneEarl ofbut no his family name had
never been told in California

Portions of the services he had heard that day drifted through his mind
Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he
shall not enter therein    We do sign him with the sign of the cross
in token hereafter that he shall manfully fight against the sin the
world and the devil and to continue Christs faithful soldier unto
his lifes end So the child starting on his earthly journey with the
ministers blessing and the backing of twenty godfathers

The holy old church service which he had heard at home in stately
English cathedralsthe nuggets in the contribution platethe radiant
bride who had come across the plains to hear Dearly Beloved We are
gathered together standing beside the man she loved The service for
the dying When we shall have served thee in our generation we may be
gathered unto our Fathers having the testimony of a good conscience
the confidence of a certain faith in favor with Thee our God and in
perfect charity with the world So Jim Muldoon cut down before his
time and his slayer out there in the darkness on the end of a rope

The dying candle picked out in flame a withered cabbage rose under the
table a babys mitten the letter written for the man who had died the
Mexicans sombrero on a chair the gilt sun and moon and stars on the
glass face of the grandfather clock by the window

Duncans head fell forward in his clasped arms on the table and in his
dreams he heard the huntsmans silver horn from across the seas calling
him home to carry on the destiny of the ancient and honorable name which
was his His strike of pay ore in his land of gold

The candle wick in a shallow pool of tallow flared high and went out

The old clock chimed twelve




The Tom Bell Stronghold

II

 You smile O poet and what do you
 You lean from your window and watch lifes column
 Trampling and struggling through dust and dew
 Filled with its purposes grave and solemn
 An act a gesture a facewho knows
 And you pluck from your bosom the verse that grows
 And down it flies like my red red rose
 And you sit and dream as away it goes
 And think that your duty is donenow dont you

 Bret Harte


In the early days it was called the Mountaineer House Now it is
colloquially known as the stone house and has for sixty years been
the home of the Owen King family It is surrounded today by one of the
most beautiful orchards in the foothills Wide verandahs of the native
gray granite to match the old house itself have been added It is
electrically lighted and furnace heated modern in every way yet still
the romance of former times seems to cling to its sturdy old walls

All that remain unchanged are three huge trees flanking the highway in
front What tales they could tell if they would of what passed by the
junction of two roads beneath them Of the long and weary caravans from
across the plains crawling up from the bridge at Whiskey Bar below
Rattlesnake glad that their six months struggle was nearly over of
horsemen on beautiful Spanish horses riding furiously whither no one
knew nor dared ask of dark deeds in the old stone house below that
was so inscrutably quiet by day and so mysteriously alive by night of
ghastly doings by the Tom Bell gang which ranged all the way from the
Oregon border to the southern lakes

They will never tell all they knowthese big old treesof those
who went in by the door and came out by the cellar of Tom Bells
stronghold In the end the place fell in the war between order and
lawlessness and as the pessimists love to assert a woman as usual
was the cause of it The tale is told

Rosa Phillips sat in the Mountaineer House strumming a Spanish guitar
and singing

 Theres a turned down page as some writer says in every human life
 A hidden story of happier days of peace amidst the strife
 A folded down leaf which the world knows not A love dream rudely crushed
 The sight of a face that is not forgot Although the voice be hushed

She rose and stood at a window holding the dusty curtain aside with
one white hand and peering cautiously forth into the dusk A horse was
galloping up the Folsom road The horseman was nearwas under the trees
in frontwas pastand gone down the river road without slackening his
animals rapid gait

He does not stop at the Mountaineer House these days said Tom Bells
sneering voice at her elbow There is a new actress at the opera house
in Rattlesnake

The womans dark eyes flashed but she answered evenly enough

He does not stop the handsome Dick so you senor have not the cause
to be jealous Is it not so

Cause Why you Spanish jade youve never been the same to me since
Rattlesnake Dick came prowling back from Shasta county to his old haunts
in Placer Rosas thin red lips curled

Senor I am what it pleases me to be

And Jack Phillips permits you to be

She shrugged her slender shoulders

He wearies me Lifethis placewearies me

Yes and I weary you toonow Plain as day it is

The Phillips woman smiled she seldom laughed and there was only
cruelty in her smileno kindliness no womanly softness of any sort

My friend soon there will be no you The night is coming and there
will be no sunrise

A man dismounted at the gate and led his horse past the window to the
stables in the cellar He walked with a curious halting pace

Theres Jim Driscoll back already Must bring news said Bell leaving
her hurriedly and so neglecting to ask the meaning of her cryptic
remark

Rosa slipped in behind the bar late that evening beautifully gowned
and with her dark hair dressed high Her vivid face glowed like a
scarlet poppy and was bright with smiles Three or four men in the
crowded barroom rose to their feet and drank to her bright eyes and
strolled across to the bar

Soon now she whispered I shall sweep out the lights Those two
who have just enteredwho are they She went across the room to the
newcomers The senors may pay me for the drinks if they desire she
said to them meaningly

La Rosita shall take what pleases her one of them laughed Among
the handful of coins and small nuggets he brought from his pocket was a
bullet strung on a bit of dirty twine

Ah a love token senor

Yes from the throat of Betsy Jane a term often used for a rifle

In twenty minutes my friends there will be opened a chute into
purgatory for all who are in this bar room Your love token names you
Senor Bells men Before then you will seek the rear of the roomeh

She drifted away from them to pause at a small table where sat a young
man alone

And you pretty fellow you are new in California

Yes I landed in San Francisco only ten days ago He was new indeed
or he would have realized the danger of telling his business to the
first person who asked

You go far senor

Not now I have come far but my journey is near to a very happy
ending

So

Yes I have come to marry Miss Elena Ashley at Auburn to whom I have
been long betrothed

She tapped her white teeth with her fan

And yet you linger at Mountaineer House

Horses are expensive and I am not rich I walked I was tired I saw
you in your garden and you are very beautiful

Rosas capricious vanity was touched The whim seized her to save this
exuberant young bridegroom from the fate before him

Do you see that peddlerold Rosenthalclose to the bar He brought in
a large and rich pack tonight It lies in the next room Do you go there
at once I will come soon and together we will select a gift for your
bride Go quickly

She passed again behind the bar Jack Phillips was at one end lame
Jim Driscoll at the other Tom Bell in the middle Rosa paused near
a branching candelabra which had once graced the altar of a Spanish
church

Is Jose below whispered Bell She nodded Why did you save that boy
just now A new lover She directed upon him a level glance of hate

I do what pleases me senor She raised her arm high beginning the
first stamping measure of a Spanish dance Instantly there was a curious
rumbling noise in the stable underneath Rosa swept over the candelabra
All the lights in the place were struck out Phillips and Driscoll
slipped two great bolts and the entire barroom floor swung downward on
hinges

The chute to purgatory was open

There was bedlam in that dank pass to the region of shades and no
quarter was shown to any man only cries of The String The String
from members of the gang in order to distinguish the robbers from the
robbed in the darkness There were curses the kicking and squealing
of horses in their stalls a verse from the Talmud recited in Yiddish
which suddenly stopped and above it all the high and hysterical laugh
of a woman

The boy turned from the peddlers pack as Rosa entered the room What
is that horrible noise

A fight Come you had better go She led him down a dark stair to
another section of the cellar Jose she called An evil looking
Mexican pushed open a rough door You shall take this man out through
the second tunnel

Si senora

And Jose he shall reach the outer opening alive and with all his
belongings He has no money Do you hear Jose grunted Go now
under cover of the noise

But the gift for Elena

Rosa laughed mockingly What a child it is My gift to Elena tonight
is youher lover Ask her to thank me with a prayer from her pure heart
for my sins

Jose led the young man through a long damp evilodored passage
underground and out through a trapdoor at the extreme end of the
garden A shrub grew on top of the door surrounded by a bed of fragrant
wild pansies Jose kicked the staring youth away from the entrance and
vanished into the earth looking in the lanternlight like a malevolent
fiend returning to the realm of everlasting fire

    

The balls which were given at the Franklin House on the old Pioneer road
were the most pretentious of the year Feminine loveliness in silks
and cameos gathered from every section General Sutter and his officers
sometimes were there and the Spanish grandees brought to them the
lovely stareyed beauties of their households

On this night a brilliant assemblage stood about in the ballroom floor
ready for a quadrille Elena Ashley and her betrothed were near the wide
entrance doors

There is Sheriff Paul of Calaveras County she told him He does not
dance I wonder what brings him here

The doors opened and Rosa Phillips entered magnificently jewelled and
dressed in a rich silk of pearl grey Elena stared clutching at her
partners arm

Oh look she shrieked she is wearing my wedding dress My wedding
dress which was stitched at the shop of Rosenthal the peddler in
Sacramento and which he was to bring me two weeks ago I know it is
mine There is the pearl passementre on it that was my mothers There
is none other like it in California

So answered Rosa cooly glancing down at the voluminous silken folds
of her robe Then she stood waving her big fan her large dark eyes
roving across the throng

Mine Host came quickly forward It is not permitted senora that
you

Rosa smiled cynically I the silken hawk came not to flutter your
nest of doves senor I came but for a little hour to meet a man
whoAh he is coming now Sheriff Paul I have that to tell you
which

The sheriff offered his arm ceremoniously and they passed out of the
ballroom Tender hearted Elena was conscience stricken She dropped her
lovers arm and darted after them through the big doors

Oh I am sorry I did not meanplease Sheriff Paul she may have the
dress poor thing But for her I should have had no man to marry on my
wedding day next week

Sheriff Paul turned quickly Elena frightened clapped two little hands
over her mouth Rosa shrugged indifferently and tipping back her small
black head listened to the music in the ballroom

Madam to Rosa you sent for me making strange promises which for
the safety of this community I hope that you are now pleased to keep

Without lowering her chin she looked at him through sinister narrowed
eyelids and a smile of triumphant malice touched her face

Senor I make no promises which I fail to keep she answered and
there is also a promise which I made Senor Tom Bell

    

There is some one knocking at the cellar door said Tom Bell to
Phillips See who is there and be careful that you let no one in
without the bullet and the password

Tom Im afraid whined Driscoll that Spanish devils promised to
get you hung more than once lately and last night I know she sent
that Mexican Jose of hers out somewhere with a string and bullet I saw
them

What Why didnt you tell me before Listen Phillips is in trouble
Go help him Call the boys Hurry As Jim Driscoll with a halt in his
walk left him Tom Bell stole quietly to one of the tunnels and ran to
the trapdoor which opened into an outhouse

He found the corral full of saddlehorses and the Mountaineer House
completely surrounded by Sheriff Pauls posse

Come on boys said a voice

Did he get in

Yeahput his hand in with the bullet on a string got his foot in the
door gave the password and heaved the door wide open Come on now and
theres orders not to take the woman remember

Bell stole a rawboned roan from the corral and was far from the
frightful battle at Mountaineer House before he dared burst forth into
the vituperation which he heaped upon the name of Rosa Phillips

    

Rosa sat strumming her guitar idly and musing upon the events of the
past few months Jack Phillips was serving a term in prison Driscoll
had also been sent to the penitentiary One day a rumor reached her that
he was threatening to turn states evidence and to divulge the truth in
regard to Rosenthal

Three days later an iron bar was accidentally dropped on his head
through some mysterious agent he was given poison and died At the
memory of it Rosa smiled her enigmatic and implacable smile Tom Bell
was at large somewhere far to the north and sheshe was rich now and
she would go back to Monterey perhaps She drew her guitar closer and
sang

The far distant sound of a harps soft stringsan echo on the air The
hidden page may be full of sweet things of things that once were fair
Theres a turned down page in each life and minea story might unfold
But the end was sad of the dream divine It better rests untold

It was time for Harlan to arrive Charlie Harlan the man whom she
hoped to cajole into buying Mountaineer House She strolled out into the
garden as Harlan rode up and tied his horse under one of the trees

A happy pair passed A delicate girl mounted upon a little mule and a
sturdy youth walking in the dust his hand upon the beasts shoulder
With their serene and joyillumined faces they somehow suggested the
holy family symbolical of all that was divine in a sordid world

The girl smiled and waved to Rosa but the young man doffed his hat
coldly and hastened by

The sweet little Elena said Rosa to herself and her loverhusband
I wear the silken wedding gown which no lover sees but she travels the
way in calico with the man she loves May the Blessed Virgin grant that
she shall have no turned down pages in her life and forcing her proud
and bitter mouth into a provocative smile she went forward to welcome
Harlan




The Hanging of Charlie Price

III

 He goes to the well
 And he stands on the brink
 And stops for a spell
 Jest to listen and think
 Lets seewell that fortyfoot grave wasnt his sir
 that day anyhow

 Bret Harte


Everywhere in the foothills of the Sierras there are still evidences of
gold mining High cliffs face the rivers all that is left of hills torn
down at the point of the powerful hydraulic nozzles with great heaps
of cobbles at their base which Mother Nature even in seventy years has
been unable to change or cover

At the mouth of nearly every ravine there are countless little mounds
which marked the end or dump of the sluicebox in the placer mining
When the mound got the proper height the sluice was simply lengthened
like putting another joint onto a caterpillarand there you were The
sluiceboxes have long since been moved away or rotted to mould but
the little mounds remain to be mansions for hustling colonies of small
black ants

The country in various localities is pitted with prospect holes and
the hills are pierced with drift tunnels and abandoned mines Some of
the prospect holes are mere grassy cups others are very deep and partly
filled with water

Some of the most engrossing days of my childhood were spent in exploring
these places with my two boy companions We would fell an oak sapling
across the mouth of the hole tie a rope usually my ponys lariat to
the tree and slide down it to explore the depths below If we came to
a side drift we would swing into it light our candlelanterns and
go looking for gold We were always sure that we should yet find a
forgotten cache of goldperhaps guarded by a lonely skeletonbut we
never did

About all we ever got out of it was snakefrights naturally sans
alcoholic origin until we were sure the snakes were not rattlers
baby bats which invariably tried to bite us swallows eggs wet feet
and a good spanking if the family happened to find out what we had been
up to

I suppose that it really was a very dangerous pastime for although
sometimes the drift tunnel led us to a sunlit opening on the hillside
more often we reached a blind end and were forced to return to the main
shaft and to shin up the rope with from ten to forty feet of inky
water waiting to catch us if we fell

Or we went up the river to swing the rocker for old Ali Quong He
always pretended to drive us away bellowing fiercely as soon as he
caught sight of us Whassa malla you Alle time you come see Ali Quong
Ketchem toooo much tlouble for poor old Chinamanthe whole time with
his wrinkled brown face wreathed in smiles

There we stayed the long summer afternoon swinging the rocker while
Quong shoveled in the pebbly dirt watching him take the black sand
which held the gold off the canvas with his little spadelike scoop
and panning it for him in the heavy iron pan fascinated to see what
we should find Usually only a few small nuggets in a group of colors
flake gold but once we found a good sized nugget which Quong
gallantly gave me for a Chinese New Year gift At dusk he sent us
home each with a bar of brown barley sugarsmelling to the blue of
opiumwhich he fished out of one of his numerous jumpers with his
longfingered sensitive hands

They are dead long agoAh Quong old Sing ShotgunChinamanand gone
to the blessed region of the Five Immortals I know but every true
Californian will understand the regard the pioneer families had for
these faithful Chinese servitors who took as much loving pride in the
aristocratic and unblemished names of their familees as the white
persons who bore them Four generations of my family old Sing lived to
servebut I must get on with my fortyniners tale of the hanging of
Charlie Price

Eh mon but the spring is here again said Jim Hutch Hutchinson
to Old Man Greeley

Is it so now returned the little man gazing off through the sunny
velvet air to a world which had been painted clean new green His
shrewd blue eyes returned to the ponderous Scotchman

And how came you to realize that it was spring he asked maliciously

How came you to lick Sandy McArthurrr Hutchinson came back at him
Tell me that

Well but whisper man said old Jimmie plaintively what else could
a man be after doin Me boots were on an I could not run away an
climb a tree so I used them on McArthur

Yere a wild fightin Irishman with no regard for the Sabbath
returned Jim Hutch sternly Now Greeley had a fear of what the dour
old Scotchman might tell upon him It would not pay to lose his Celtic
temper

It was to church I was goin he growled Twas why I was wearin me
redtopped high boots

Where was church that day whatever At the Widow Schmitts

Jimmie squirmed You mentioned the beautiful spring I mind he
countered deftly Suddenly Jim Hutch grinned

Ill tell ye why I was gaein down frae Rattlesnake this afternoon an
Charlie Price an his Leezie were out in his bit garden aplowin Mon
ye could hear him for miles

It was even so Old Charlie Price had decided that it was high time to
put in his vegetable garden He went out to the leanto in his corral
to inform Lizzie the mare of his intention Lizzie was always the
unwilling partner of these agricultural peregrinations and now she saw
him approaching with the harness she ran away with much snorting and
scattering of sod

Hey you Liz roared Charlie you gootfornoting buckskin lummix
you com mit He flourished the halter rope at her Lizzie flattened her
ears opened her mouth like a yawning snake and ran at him Old Charlie
let out a whoop that brought the sheriff from Rattlesnake at full speed
and could be heard so they say all the way across the river to Wild
Goose Flat six miles away

Even Lizzie accustomed as she was to Charlies mannerisms was frankly
startled and meekly allowed herself to be caught She did not like to
plow She was a saddler and a pair of tugs and a collar bored her With
a cinch one could puff out in true wildhorse fashion while the latigo
strap was being pulled and afterward be fairly comfortable but a
slipping collar was neither off nor on She shook herself impatiently
and the collar slid down her neck to her ears

Hey bellowed Charlie you dont vear it so You The mare stamped
at a fly bringing her hoof down on the old Dutchmans foot His
bloodcurdling whoops and yells brought the sheriff in on a brilliant
finale to a recordbreaking run

Whats the matter Are you being murdered

Who Im asked Charlie absentmindedly He was nursing the injured
member wondering whether to kick at Lizzie with it knowing full well
that he stood a good chance of her kicking back again but when she
snapped viciously at the puffing sheriff he decided against it

You com to see me he asked in a bland sogladyouvecalled tone

To see you Why Ive come to save your life

So Dots goot but Lizzie undt me ve aint got so much time today
Its vegetables I sell in Rattlesnake undt ve go to plow now

Well you old fool after this you can call in vain if anything happens
to you Ill never bother with you

Oh vell ven I got a little excitement I got to yell about it aint
it

Maybe you haveand after this you can for all of me and the
wrathful sheriff departed He was new in the community or he would have
known that the plowing of Charlie Price and Lizzie was a regular event
of each season for which an audience gathered to lay bets for and
against the probability of his dying of apoplexy before it was finished

The plowing progressed in this manner

Charlie put the point of the plow in the soft earth and roared at the
motorpower Lizzie started off at a nimble lope The plow cut a pretty
curve and flew out of the ground Charlie reefed the reins at once
completely turning off the power Then he put the reins about his neck
grasped the handles of the plow with both hands and zoomed commands
again at the champing power Power jumped ahead The reins nearly
snapped old Charlies head off but effectually brought the mare to a
standstill

Vait you dunderundtblitzen apful peelings Youyou think dot
plowing is not hightoned enough yethey Vell I show you

He picked up a huge clod of soft dirt held it aloft in both hands and
banged it down on Lizzies backwhereupon she promptly ran away She
galloped furiously to the end of the field with the plow banging in
scoops and leaps and old Charlie dangling on the end of the reins
flying along in sevenleague jumps behind her As soon as he caught his
breath sufficiently for renewed directions the cavalcade returned to
the grandstand and operations were repeated

Charlie had been a sailor before he came to California and he plowed
 each furrow with a collection of forceful admonitions delivered in
a voice of thunder from a different language It was all the same to
Lizzie She loathed plowing just as thoroughly in wildcat Spanish as
she did in Dutch or Cingalese and she did not hesitate to prove it

Jim Hutch and Jimmie Greeley drifted down to Rattlesnake at sundown and
joined the laughterweakened group perched upon Charlies snake fence

The man grows more daft every year Tis strange what charms the Widow
Schmitt Old Jimmie merely growled in his beard Charlie mon he
called the mare is warm and weary and sos yoursel Come on to town
for a bit

Charlie stayed overlong at the miners haunts in Rattlesnake and it was
very late when he started back to his cabin carrying in one limp hot
hand a jug which he guarded zealously from harm during his unsteady
progress

The men still sat over the card tables when the first daylight crept
over the mountains Jimmie Greeley was raking in a jackpot grinning
fiendishly at the dour Jim Hutch when they heard heavy running feet
outside The door crashed open and a frightened halfgrown lad shouted

Wheres the sheriff Charlie Price has been hung

What

On a tree near the Widow Schmitts I saw him I know well the sailor
coat that he wearsand his best redtopped boots Wheres the sheriff

Over at Ah Quongs the Chinee store on the edge of town The boy ran
off Old Jim Hutch rose impressively to his feet

Friends the man ye hae laughed at all dayis dead The man ye hae
always laughed atand yet WHO was it that lent ye gold when ye had
none Yea the gold ye thought it not worth yer while to return Who
was ever ready to warm you at his bit fire in winter or to cool yere
whuskeyhot throat with water from his cool spring in summer

Who was it that brought his mare into his own kitchen when it snowed
and fed her the rice and beans he went without Who was it that the
Widow Schmitt waits for year after year with half the ould fools in
Placer dancin after her

That was too much for old man Greeley

Because he was indifferentlike When ye want a woman run away
frrom her and shell run after

Why did ye na do it then Jeems

Faith an I did but bein ahl dressed up as I was in me coat she
couldnt see me suspenders to tell was I comin or goin Jim Hutch
turned from him witheringly

Who was it staked ye for a new prospectin trip an let his own mine
go unworked Who nursed ye when ye were lyin seeck unto death an
no one would come nigh on account of the smallpox scare Old Charlie
Price

A boy whirled about to face the window but not before one
uncontrollable sob had sounded through the quiet room

Who was it went on the old Scotchman gently found the wee bairn
that was lost last summer that followed the Indians for thirty miles
on his Leeziemare and got the babe from out the wickiup of White
Beaver Charlie Price

Who came bringing it haeme laughing on the saddle pommel while he sang
to it songs from ower seven seas which we did blush to hear in a
voice to be heard twa miles about And twas only the bairns mother who
thought to thank him

Yea and furthermore when the incensed people would hae wipet out the
while tribe of White Beaver who dashed at the mob wi the roars of a
bullbison forcin them to hear that the squaw was crazed from the death
of her own bit bairn and but tryin to comfort her sore heart Who Im
askin ye and from each mans lips came the murmur like a response to
a litany

Charlie Price

 From the open door a cool dawn breeze blew in from the Sierras pure
forerunner to the new day It whirled the heavy smoke plumes into forms
of vanished ghosts like the tortured figments of each mans conscience
who had done and left undone that which it was forever too late to
amend

The sheriff walked in

This boy says that old Charlie is gone He stood with his broad hat
off running his fingers nervously through his hair GentlemenII
must confessI heard the poor man calling but

Mon in an ancient book named Mr Aesop His Fables there was a tale
of the lad who cried wolf Many there are here who have read it Come
let us gae after poor Charlie

In the first daylight they reached the tree with its gruesome burden

Butbut sputtered the keeneyed little Irishman Tis not Charlie
at all Tis but an effigy dressed in Charlies clothes and hung at the
Widow Schmitts gate

As a warnin to him frae some muttonhead lover of hers

They ran as one man across the road to Charlies cabin It was empty

He was callin Help said the roundeyed boy

Yes we heard him added the sheriff

They had come up the road They started back down the trail

    

Charlie had got nearly home when he began to worry about a deep prospect
hole near the trail known as Rosenhammers Shaft He must be careful
to avoid it Suddenly his foot slipped on a pebble He clutched
unavailingly at a manzanita and rolled into a circle of inky blackness
Rosenhammers Shaft Now he was lost indeed

But no As he slid he came against a sturdy liveoak bush which he
clutched managing to stop his descent into the next world for the time
being He even swung one leg over a wiry limb and there he clung
puttering sailors argot considering his sins and roaring for help in
his best fortissimo tone

The shaft was said to be a hundred feet deep It was filled part
way with oily water and inhabited by snakes and monsters of the
subterranean deeps People had fallen in and drowned and had been known
never to rise again The ghost of a Chinaman who had been murdered and
flung down was said to float up from its depths at night to range the
earth seeking the perpetrator of the fiendish deed

Charlie wished that he had led a more blameless life that he had not so
thoroughly beaten the Indian who had sold him a salted mine that he had
not made Lizzie plow that above all he had married the Widow Schmitt
when she had so plainly shown her liking for him

Well it did not matter much He would fall in forty feet of water and
they would never find him He wished that he had drunk that which the
jug contained It was growing daylight What was the day then to him
He would never live to see it His arms were numb He must soon let go
and fall to his doom

He heard voices but was too spent to call out As a crowd of men came
running over the hill his arms were slippingslipping It was almost
broad day

He made one last herculean effort to hold fast turning his head
over his shoulder to glance into the deathtrap below andjust as
his repentant rescuers reached him he gave a disgusted snort and
fellthree feet to the bottom of the hole

In the darkness he had safely passed the Rosenhammer shaft and had
fallen into the sixfeetdeep prospect hole of his own claim

Two days later Charlie married the Widow Schmitt




Rattlesnake Dick

IV

 Again swings the lash on the high mountain trail
 And the pipe of the packer is scenting the gale
 For the trails are all open the roads are all free
 And the highwaymans whistle is heard on the lea

 Bret Harte


We were riding one day under the Digger pines down an abandoned old
road toward Mountaineer House As usual my spirited halfArab as white
as she was fleet had put me far in the lead She loved a race as well
as I did but she ran it to suit herself If I tried to interpose any
theories of my own she calmly took the bit in her teeth and after that
I devoted most of my energies to hanging on

Mammy Kate own daughter of Nancy Gooch of Coloma would scold when I
came home with torn skirt and a bump on my forehead Now den look at
dat chile Been hossracin agin suah as Moses was in Egypt I shall
suttenly enjine yo fathah to done gin yo plowhoss to ride so yos
gwi git beat wiff yo racin and quit Spects yo had nothah tumble
didnt you You wait till Katie gits de camphfire an put on dat
haid

So did Katies scoldings invariably end in renewed pampering of her
chile and so did I continue to race every horse in the community and
usually to win

With one small ear laid back to listen for the other horses little
white Flossie flew along the grassy track darting around the chapparal
bushes which had grown up and jumping the fallen tree trunks Suddenly
we came out of the woods and she shied violently at a man who was
digging a fencepost hole directly in the road I always rode Indian
fashion without stirrups of any kind so of course I was catapulted
neatly over her head

Hello Otto I said remaining seated in the road and catching at
Floss bridle rein what have you found

Otto was sifting the loose dirt in the hole through eager fingers

Hello Ive found some money here in the ground I wonderoh yes
Ive heard my mother tell about it This was the old pioneer road and it
was at this very spot that Rattlesnake Dick and some of his gang held
up the WellsFargo stage coach and got such a lot of money They say
theres still 40000 buried on Trinity Mountain half of what was
waiting when Rattlesnake Dick got killed

Rattlesnake Dick pirate of the placers prince of highwaymen Magical
nameirridescent bubble from the pipe of romance Proud imperious
bitter Dick What a splendid old name he had been born to and what
blows Fate had dealt him which led to his tragic end

The others had come up by this time and we sat in a circle listening
again to the story of the bold and brilliant Englishman whom two
undeserved jail sentences had turned into such a picturesque daredevil
of a highwayman However I disagreed with Ottos version of the robber
chief

But you have made him out all bad I told him I have heard the story
often and he wasnt all bad by any means

He was a wild desperado Why even after he was dead and lying on the
sidewalk in Auburn a man came up and kicked his face

Yes and they say that everybody in the county was mad about it and
when the man ran for supervisor more than a year later no decent person
would vote for him and he lost his election Now the true story of
Rattlesnake Dick is this and I never tire of hearing it

Would you present me to your sisters friend then George

Why not

I am an Ishmailite I the son of an honorable English gentleman have
done a term in prison

But these ideas are extreme Dick There is no such general opinion
of you Were you not exonerated from having stolen the wretched little
Jews goods It is all forgotten and George Taylor paused in his
restless pacing before the long graceful figure on the bunk against
the wall Dick raised handsome eyes whose flashing light was made of
pain

George I wishhow I wish that it were forgotten But it is not They
whisper it in doorways and over the card tables and down in the drift
tunnels Wherever I go it follows me like an evil spirit rearing its
unclean head between me and all fair things His deep voice reflected
the hurt in his dark eyes and his broad shoulders drooped in
despondency

DickDick the gay the debonairthis is not like you Brace up man
and come with me to this opening of the new opera house if only to add
to my pleasure All the town will be there to hear the singer who has
just landed in San Francisco from Boston

She it was who brought you the letter from your sister

Yes yes They were schoolmates She is beautiful and you shall meet
her after the concert

The Opera House was crowded the front rows seating the leading men
of the community and their richly clad wives and daughters In the back
rows seated on benches and around the side walls were the roughly
dressed miners and the usual flotsam of a mining town The singer was
not of the hurdygurdy type so common in those days but a lady
young lovely and accomplished Her ballads were greeted with the
greatest enthusiasm and soon the stage began to be showered with gold
The miners brought her back again and again calling the names of songs
they wished to hear Hundreds of dollars of gold were tossed up to her
whilst she smilingly complied with all their requests

One more they shouted only one more and her slippers shall be
filled with gold dust She slipped out of her little sandals and stood
blushing modestly hiding her silken feet under her long wide skirts

You are very kind to a lonely stranger she called to an instantly
silenced audience and I will sing for you a song which has but lately
come from London Tis from a new opera called the Bohemian Girl
composed by Master Balfe and folding her little hands before her she
sang sweetly Then Youll Remember Me

When other lips and other hearts their tales of love shall tell Of days
that have as happy been and youll rememberyoull remember me

Dick why do you cover your eyes You are surely not asleep

By all the Gods man the accusation is an insult with a haughty
flash of his great eyes

You are to be presented have you forgotten

Forgotten While life lasts I shall remember this night

Hush this is the last She is singing Home Sweet Home

Yes Home for these wanderers from all over the earth See how
silently they file out

There is many a tear among them They will lie tonight on memorys
couch of sad dreams

You are wrong my friend said Dick bitterly they are more like
to hasten down to the gambling hells to kill the visions memory would
recall

    

Sweet Bird you cannot believe this thing of me The SingerLady
raised her bright head from Dicks shoulder and met steadfastly his
passionately adoring eyes

Richard how can you for one moment doubt me I know you to be good
and true Were you not exonerated from the last accusation of which you
informed me before you asked for my hand in marriage And do we not know
that this man is actuated by the motive of jealousy

The Mormon beast He knows well that I did not steal his mule

No naughty boy tapping him playfully with her fan Twas something
else you stole from Master Crow the woman he wanted Often have I
noticed on the streets how all women every one turn to look after
you

I cared not for her He shook his tall and beautiful head impatient
of the silky black lock which fell across his forehead

Perhaps then tis your magnificent carriage they would admire laughed
the girl teasingly

Dick swept her close to his heart My goldenthroated dove I cannot
join in your sweet laughter for I have a boding heart this day I have
enemies They will use my past record The courts are new and judgments
swift and cold If they should send me again to the penitentiary I

Dearest I should know you to be innocent and I should wait for you

He kissed her tenderly on cheeks and eyes and mouth He took her hands
from his shoulders slipping off the little silken mitts and putting
them in an inner pocket and kissed the soft pink palms

Ah LadyBird if I should not return youll remember me

Always

My own pure love No breath of shame shall ever sully your fair name
through me

Right well I know that Richard God bless you I will pray for you
every hour

At evening George Taylor brought her a note from Dick

Oh George she wailed they have sentenced him

Two years in prison

But he was innocent

Yes and some day it will be proven He looked at her strangely I
must tell youDick has broken jail and fled north to Shasta county
where he will begin life anew Then if you still wish it he will come
to you

    

After four years the SingerLady returned for a concert at the little
Opera House in Rattlesnake She went to her old quarters at the Widow
Millers on the edge of town

Eh Dearie cried the good woman what have they been doing to ye so
to dim your bright youth and to bring the sad lines to your mouth

Mrs Miller where is he

Ahso thats the answer The girls eyes filled with tears

Four yearsand for the last two no word I must find George Taylor
Perhaps he

Dearie George Taylor is with Dick and the Skinners and Cherokee Bob
and Lame Jim Driscoll They say too that at times Dick rides with Tom
Bells gang

Ah he tried with all a strong mans power to win a new name for
himselfand for youbut Fate was too strong His false record followed
him up and down the state from every idle throat casting a blight over
all he sought to do Every sheriff hounded him on Each unproven crime
was laid at his door

But why did he not come to me Oh he had my whole heart and he knew
it

He did come to you two years ago to ask if you would return to Canada
with him hoping that it was too far for tales from California to
travel As soon as he reached San Francisco he was recognized by one of
the authorities and shown up by the Vigilante Committee in the Plaza
as they put up all dangerous characters for the police and the people to
see

And whilst he was there you passed walking with another man and
looked him in the eyes and knew him not Twas that which broke his
heart and made him the reckless and brilliant devil that he is today

Butbut cried the SingerLady recovering from the daze these words
had placed upon her I did not pass Oh I should have fallen at his
feetlost to all maidenly reservethere before the people It must
have been my sister who had but lately come from Boston and so would
not know him and she broke into uncontrollable weeping

There child dry your tears Try to be brave You care for him still

Always I have never ceased to pray for him If I cannot become his I
shall go lonely to my grave Tell me everything kind Mrs Miller

He robs the stages of the WellsFargo box but lets the passengers go
free and he has never been known to take anything from a woman He says
that since all the world is against him his hand is against the world

His den is now at Folsom they say but he ranges far afield He robs
the sluices and the bullion trains but he does not take horses or
mules except to get away with his booty No cell can hold him He has
escaped from every jail in the northern mines He has been known to say
I shall never rot in a prison as long as a revolver can keep me out

Oh would he

He would indeed Dearie for the sake of his family name and the love
he bears you His last big raid was upon George Barstows WellsFargo
train from Yreka They held them up on Trinity Mountain Eighty thousand
dollars in bullion they got even with twenty men guarding it

Mrs Miller tiptoed to the window and looked out Coming back to the
girl she whispered The guards are tied to trees and the gang is
waiting for Dick and Cy Skinner to get back with new mules as the
WellsFargo mules all are branded and would give them away but if he
finds out that you are here he may

The SingerLady sprang to her feet From the trees behind the house
floated a snatch of song in a clear baritone

When coldness or deceit shall slight the beauty now they prize When
hollow hearts shall wear a mask twill break your own to see At such a
moment I but ask that youll remember me youll

By this time the girl was sobbing in Dicks arms and the
misunderstandings of four years were soon explained

The SingerLady lifted her head at last to the sound of galloping
horses Dick was looking calmly in their direction Terror seized her

What is that

You must return to the house They must not see you here

She clung to him with the wail of a breaking heart

It is the sheriff and his deputies This morning George and I were
on the Folsom stage We were stopped by a deputy sheriff and sternly
requested to alight We entered into conversation with the gentleman of
the lawwhom I had met several times before with a grim smile and
finally George with due deference to authority demanded to be shown
the warrant for our arrest

Whilst the simple creature was fumbling for it we opened fire and
springing from the top of the stage escaped across Harmon Hill The
vain fellow carried only a derringer and how was one little bullet to
stop our race for liberty

Yet you returned here That was madness

I heard of you and the longing to see you once more overcame every
other feeling

Do not fear I knew that they would come What was that to pay for the
chance of seeing you again They can but put me in Auburn jail and no
locks can hold me except the shining ones on this dear head No prison
can keep me till I am laid in that last one beneath the grass and there
I will wait for you dear love I shall not hear the celestian singing
till your sweet voice has joined the angel choir and your two
handssee I still carry the little mittsshall open the door for me
to Paradise as they have held all of heaven for me on earth

It may be in that last court the Great judge of all will look into my
heart which strove to be honorable and will dismiss the accusations of
mere mortal man

    

As usual Dick escaped the jail and with George Taylor attempted to
get away but Fate had dealt him her last blow and on the scroll of his
precarious and bitter life had written finis A mile above Auburn they
were overtaken by Assessor George W Martin and Deputy Sheriffs
Crutcher and Johnston In the terrible encounter which ensued Martin was
instantly killed and Dick mortally wounded

They rode more than a mile at a furious pace from the scene of his last
fight before Dick lay down to die George put him on his great riding
cloak and spread a saddle blanket over him Then when he read a fresh
command in the highwaymans dark eyes he faltered

Dick old friendI cannot

I am shot through the breast and again through the side You promised
that when I came to this pass you would grant the liberation I seek in
death

I cannot From any hand but mine may you find release

Very well answered Dick resolutely my own hand shall be given the
power to save my immortal soul He wrote laboriously on a bit of paper
Rattlesnake Dick dies but never surrenders as all true Britons do

Go George he said gently but first give me my pistol I have in
my pocket here a letter from the sweetest of women It says I have
grieved but never despaired for I have prayed to the Father that he
would restore you to the paths of rectitude and I say faithfully He
will save you He sees in your heart a secret wish to be a better
man Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all things shall be added
thereunto He will raise your head and make of you a new man I go to
Him my brother And raising his gun with a good womans adored name
on his lips he released his sorely tried heart from bondage into the
unknown




Indian Vengeance

 Those brave old bricks of fortynine
 What lives they lived What deaths they died
 Their ghosts are many Let them keep
 Their vast possessions The Piute
 The tawny warrior will dispute
 No boundary with these

 Joaquin Miller



High water on the American came usually when the first warm rains
melted the snow on the mountains

The placer miners toiled at furious pace all during the summer and fall
The water then not more than a rivulet was deflected through flumes
from the river bed so that all the sand of the bars could be put
through the sluices

The men worked till the last possible moment in the narrow river bed
only leaving in time to save their lives and abandoning everything to
the sudden rush of the water Their sluices logs flumes waterwheels
all their mining paraphernalia sometimes even their living outfits
were swept away in the floods

The river was known to rise from 20 to 60 feet in 24 hours in its
narrow and precipitous walls

At flood time then we often went down to the river through the orchard
of big old cherry trees planted by my grandfather to watch the mass
of wreckage rushing by Great logs would go down end over end mining
machinery caught in the limbs of uprooted trees quantities of lumber
and once a miners bunk with sodden gray blanket and a wet and frantic
squirrel upon it I worried for days over the fate of that squirrel

They tell the story of a Chinaman floating down upon a log

Hello John where you go was shouted John shook his head sadly

Me no sabe Maybe Saclimentomaybe San Flancisco No got time talkee
now

    

Look the water is up to the top of the old stone pier said one of
the others

Mammy Kates ghost would have a hard time haunting it now I
laughed Hed be under twenty feet of water

What ghost

Why the tollkeepers of the old bridge The one who hated the Indians
so

The Bear River tribe

They were Diggers but I think that nobody knew exactly which ones
were guilty It was a fine bridge the first suspension bridge in Placer
county

It was washed away in the floods during the winter of 61 and 62
wasnt it

Yes and they built the new one a mile up the river at Rattlesnake Bar
where it still hangs

What about the tollkeeper

Here is the storywith a bit of a prologue

    

Captain Ezekiel Merritt one of the Bear Flag party in Sonoma came
in 49 to try his luck at mining on the Middle Fork of the American His
party came at last through a deep canyon to a large bar on which they
found among unmistakable evidences of a plundered camp both white
mans and Indians hair A great ash heap containing calcined bones was
undoubtedly the funeral pyre of white men and red men alike and some
yelling savages upon the upper bluff confirmed the tragedy which Captain
Merritts party had been too late to avert

They drove the Indians away and Captain Merritt cut into the bark of an
alder the name Murderers Bar by which the place has been called ever
since

The Merritt party stayed to work the bar Before the summer passed the
river swarmed with men some of whom joined forces to make up mining
companies One of the rules of such a company Any shareholder getting
drunk during the time he should be on duty shall pay into the common
treasury of the company a fine of one ounce of gold dust and shall
forfeit all dividends during such time These fines in some instances
became so frequent as to cause a total disruption of the company

The Indians returned to their villages in the hills The foothill
Indians were not a particularly intelligent lot They were Diggers so
named on account of their habits of digging in the ground for roots
and the larva of various insects for food Eggs of ants and the maggots
found in wasps nests were considered great delicacies

They also ate dried grasshoppers and young clover plants cooked as
greens They ground acorns and manzanita berries into meal with the
stone mortars and pestles so commonly found through the countryside
and gathered and stored great caches of pine burrs full of nuts for the
winter They were not as a rule quarrelsome but

    

Good morning Phineas I have brought your grub from Auburn and here
is the bill

It was a bright day in June and Phineas Longley tollkeeper for the new
suspension bridge on Whiskey Bar had had a busy morning There was a
barbecue that day at the town on the other side and a stream of people
had come down the Whiskey Bar turnpike and crossed the bridge It was
getting warm and he was tired and he read the bill gloomily

1 bottle gin 600 2 lbs biscuits 250 1 ham 2400 1 bottle
pickles 600 4 fathoms rope 500 1 watermelon 400 1 tin pan
1600 2 apples 300

Longley stuffed the bill in his pocket and returned for his noon meal
to his log cabin on shore

It was quite palatialboasting a real floor made of puncheons or hewn
logs A bunk against the wall was made of a second log set four feet
from the log wall with a hammock mattress of sacking stuffed with dried
bracken stretched between them There was the usual huge fireplace
of granite rocks used for both warmth and cooking and a box
pantrycupboard nailed to the wall

His cup and plate and saucer were of tin and his cutlery was an iron
spoon a threetined fork and a hunting dagger The dishes had not been
washed for weeks

In warm weather he kept a few things in a small palisade driven in the
shallow water at the rivers edge which was cool the year round

Longley put his raised bread dough in a frying pan put a second pan
on top raked the ashes off some coals and started it baking A man
on horseback driving two pack animals before him stopped at the low
doorway

Hello John Glad to see you called Longley

Glad to get here Like to sleep in a house again Tired of shaking the
lizards out of my blankets every morning

Ever shake out a rattler

Not yet though they say its been done more than once

Youre just in time Turn the beasts into the corral And then will you
just ride back to Kitty Douglas for me She promised me a pie and I
need a new starter for my sour dough batter By that time everything
will be ready to eat

You mean the Kitty Douglas of the signs Ive just passed asked
John grinning

Yes What were they today

Fresh pies by Kitty Douglas Bread made every day by Kitty
Douglas Newlaid eggs every day by Kitty Douglas

Kittys cooking is as fair as the reputation of her house is not She
charges two dollars for a meal of pork and beans

Tis the regular price everywhere Ill be back soon After the meal
John went to the barbecue imbibing rather freely of the firewater
barrel and making a night of it

Heavy travel continued over the bridge all afternoona prairie schooner
with three oxen two mules and a bronco pulling it a prospector in his
red flannel undershirt driving a laden donkey a hurdygurdy troupe
on its way to the barbecue a stagecoach drawn by six halfbroken wild
horses an old Spanish settler on a beautiful black thoroughbred a
late arrival from Oregon mounted upon a sturdy mule with his young wife
upon a pillion behind him and a whole drove of Chinamen being taken
out to work a white mans claim up on the Divide

There passed Welch miners who were to be the forerunners of quartz
mining miners from Australia who were to replace the wooden bateas
of the Mexicans with the rocker and the iron goldpan and the term of
specimen with nugget

Finally came a hale old voyaguer whom Longley greeted heartily as he
swung open the toll gate

Greetings Monsieur Francois Gendron and from whence came you today
The big Frenchman handed over the sixbits toll for himself and his
horse

From New Helvetia

AhSacramento

And I am bound for the North Fork Dry Diggings

Auburn smiled Longley

Bah the new names In my day we called them differently I came across
the Rockies in 32 Monsieur But I must be en routehere are sheep
coming

After the sheep were counted and gone Longley glanced scowlingly across
the bridge and hastily closed the tollgate A band of Indians several
on ponies but most of them on foot crossed the bridge and halted before
him

Go back ye varmints growled Longley

No Indian pay said the old chief He go the bridge and the roadno
pay

Well the Chinamen paid

But the Indians no No pay Me go Whiskey Barbig powwow Plenty ox
plenty bear meat plenty firewater

You go back roared the tollkeeper swearing and go ford the river
Thats good enough for a Digger The ferrys been taken off but the
water is not so high

The old Indian scowled and the young bucks began a guttural complaint
which he silenced with a gesture and a grunt of command

Water is cold and those pointing to the sheep have passed

You go back I tell you I hate every filthy brute of you My best pal
was sent to glory in that funeral fire on Murderers Bar and no Indian
will ever get aught from me

Me pay said the Indian leader slowly Me pay cayuse me pay boy

No you wont pay Youll go back and wade the river like the low
beasts that you are

The chief began a fierce oration Longley ran into the tollhouse and
came out with a sawedoff shotgun

Now will you go he cried defiantly

The Indians were sober and they went As they came abreast of the pier
under the bridge the tollkeeper jeered and laughed at them and pelted
them with rocks

They looked up with hate but went stolidly on their way

With darkness the roistering at the barbecue became louder The
Indians money was gone by this time and the fun was getting rougher
The tollkeeper after a weary day was dozing beside his candle He did
not see nor hear the stealthy forms which crept up the bridge A board
creaked and he jumped up and swung about to find himself quickly
overpowered by a dozen lithe redskins

They robbed the till then held a palaver as to the disposition of their
prisoner They finally left him tied with his own new rope to a huge
drift log at the base of the pier and went back to buy more firewater

It was a wild night

John noticed very late that the Indians seemed to be having a special
powwow of their own on the river bank near the bridge There was a
great fire and mad dancing and war whooping He started toward them

Dont go there pardner called an old trapper Them bucks is crazy
with drink an if I knows anything about Injuns it wont be no safe
place for a white man

So passed Longleys last chance for his life His cries for aid were
mingled with the savage whoops of his ferocious enemies Even the people
living across the river who heard his continued shouts took them to be
part of the celebration

Maddened by drink and by the ever mounting excitement of their
incantations one of the most ghastly deeds ever perpetrated by Indians
upon the whole river was finished before daylight

The condition of Longleys body upon its discovery roused the entire
settlement but the Indians had vanished over the hills and across Bear
river The chief had gone home at sundown and it was as impossible to
find those who were on the bar that night as to distinguish one grain
of sand from another

The old pier stands to this day notwithstanding the fierce battering of
the floods of nearly seventy years a monument enduring long after
the Digger Indians are gone off the face of the earth as though to
commemmorate the power of the white race and that member of it who gave
up his life at its base




Grizzley Bob of Snake Gulch

VI

 Be the battle lost or won
 Though its smoke shall hide the sun
 I shall find my lovethe one
 Born for me

 Bret Harte



Names of settlements in the 49 days were often as Rough an Ready as
the reasons for their being

Most of them spoke more or less eloquently for themselves and no man
picked by fame in glowing wise from the heterogeneous mass of persons
could hope to escape a nickname

A miner was discovered roaming down a river bed minus his nether
garments and lives to this day in the appellation of Shirt Tail canyon
Two men fought One of them lost an eye in the manner indicated by Gouge
Eye Hundreds of wild geese were wont to gather on a sunny mesa above
the river It made a splendid level town called Wild Goose Flat The
plains were covered with Antelope The end gate of a prairie schooner
was lost on a hill and Tail Gate mountain came into being

Humbug Creek panned light with gold Red Dog Hangtown Round Tent
Claims Dry Diggings Let Er Rip You Bet Yuba Dam One Horse Town
and Hells Delight shriek for themselves or should

This then is the tale of Grizzley Bob who mined in Snake Gulch at the
foot of Bear Mountain

The bear made straight for me Old Bulldoze was hangin onto him
below somewhere but I dropped my Killer gun and grabbed my knife
cause I knew if I didnt get in on him with Slasher it was all up
with both of us Bear and I took a tight grip on each other and I hit
straight for his heart just as he gave me a swipe in the face

We both fell the bear on top and then I didnt remember anything for
awhile When I woke I felt something heavy on my stomach but I couldnt
see anything for blood

Huray cheered old Solly Jake thinking the tale was finished

Sick Jimmy from behind the bar prodded him goodhumoredly

Dry up Soll

I am dry whimpered old Soll Im dryern before I got drunk

Here then pushing a bottle across the redwood slab used for a bar
the drinks are on Grizzley Bob and Handsome Harry tonight

Was it such a big strike they made

It sure was Go on Bob he called to the tall magnificently built
young spokesman then what

After awhile I managed to crawl from under that old grizzley and when
Id wiped the one good eye that was left I saw him lying there as stiff
and dead as a mackerel with Slasher sticking in his heart clean up to
the handle It was pretty near dark then but the sun was just showing
hisself over the top of Bear mountain when I got to Rattlesnake Bills
cabin and youll scarcely believe me but I didnt have enough grit left
to signal Bill I was there I just settled down all of a heaplike and
thats the way they found me Bill he got a doctor from Angels and
after awhile I pulled out all right but I aint been much of a
beauty since Well what th as the door banged open to reveal an
exceedingly handsome blond youngster dragging in a cringing newcomer

Hi he called while two frolicsome imps danced in his splendid blue
eyes Any of you chaps got a rope handy Time this fellow was strung up
over a limb to be a picture for coyotes to bark at

Hall you let go there Therell be no chaffing a tenderfoot whilst
Im around and you know it

Who says so laughed Handsome Harry

My foppish friend spoke up The Senator the reputation of Grizzley
Bob says so A reputation that is the terror and admiration of every
mining camp in the mountains A dead shot a sure thing with the knife
a heart to succor the oppressed and often to protect the shiftless
acridly

I thank you Senator Your species of implication is worthy the
splendor of your mighty apparel The old swallowtail retains its
pristine glory I perceive though your other habiliments have one by
one yielded to the ravages of time and been replaced by the rough and
ready garments of the frontier Perchance

Hall have I got to make you let go of this pore devil Bobs powerful
figure came forward into the full light of the huge fireplace Onehalf
the face above the comely form was hideously repulsive It had been
literally torn away and what remained was so scarred and seamed that it
scarcely bore any resemblance to a human countenance

His one remaining eye was large dark and glowing with kindness as he
bent over the victim of his partners latest joke

Yeah drawled old Doc Smithers precipitating a large mouthful of
brown liquid into the fireplace Bob hell pet im an that ol
bulldog o hisn ull lick im an next thing we know Bobll be givin
im a claim just like he took in Handsome Harry hisself goin on two
years ago Look at the dandy struttin Bob buys im all them fancy
togs an loves to see im wearin em White hands an red cheeks an
straight nose like a gal Swan ef he wasnt so ornery an longlimbed
Id a mind to call im one Ef twant for his hidin behind Bob so
Id

What hed have done was never known for the whole roomfull of
prankish loudvoiced roistering men was suddenly struck dumb by the
unwonted sound of a ladys voice out in the darkness

Bulldoze reached her first Bob next and Handsome Harry third She was
only a slip of a young thing and the fright she got from the kindly
rush of the old bulldog was immeasurably increased by Bobs frightful
caricature of a face She turned shuddering to the handsome
richlydecked young Englishman

My father and mother sir are very ill I was going after a doctor
but I am tired out I can go no further Oh could one of you go on to
Angels whilst I rest with some lady of your town

Harry was apparently speechless from the thrall of her fresh young
beauty because it was Bob who answered

You certainly can Miss Grizzley Bobs word on that Whered you come
from

From Roundtrees sir timidly Bob had turned to call orders through
the open door and the girl gasped as the strong manly profile of the
unscarred half of his face was turned toward her Bulldoze licked her
white fingers and she stooped to pat his ugly head so that the long
curls at her temple might hide her face from the look in Hals bold
eyes

Hey Antelope Bill saddle that ewenecked cayuse of yours and vamoose
pronto after the doctor Plug Hat Pete youve got the best cabin in
town Well want it for the lady

Help yourself Grizzley answered the gambler It is a privilege

I am to stay with MrsPete asked Becky anxiously

Child youre agoing to be as safe as if there was a lady in this
lawevadin camp which there isnt exceptin your own sweet and lovely
self

Oh

Youre agoing to have old Bulldoze watchin inside the cabin and
ten decent and sober men watchin outside it and nothin short of a
messenger from upskies could touch one pretty redgold curl on your
proud little head

Bob Ill take her home to her mother spoke up Harry who had never
once taken his bold gaze from the girl

No you wont take her home to her mother neither

Beckey was strangely comforted by the protective drawl of the big mans
voice Accustomed as she had grown to the rapid transitions of the West
she realized the fallacy of her first impression from his appearance
That night laid the foundation of her regard for him which was deeper
than a mere surface appeal and which was never to waver

    

Hm snorted Cornish Jack shuffling a greasy pack of cards in Sick
Jimmies place and watching two men go by thats the most willin pair
on the gulch Bob hes willin to do all the work an Handsome Harry
hes willin to let im Fine house Bobs just built Must of cost a
heap

They say that Miss Beckey and her mother are going to live in it
answered Plug Hat Pete Ill raise you ten

Handsome Harrys bin adancin round that gal ever since they moved
here six months ago

Yes and the look in her eyes in another direction is plainly to be
read The implication was lost on Cornish Jack

Ol Bob he does all he can to throw em together Air ye goin to the
house warmin tonight

Certainly said The Senator Particularly if we manage to keep old
Tommy Norton and Black Joe from getting intoxicated so there will be a
pair of fiddlers on the gulch Tommy on such occasions always has an
attack of religion which precludes the possibility of his assisting at
any profane scene of mirth and Joe falls into a deep sleep from which
nothing can rouse him for twentyfour hours

Theres Antelope back I hear his roan

Well who do you think I met down around the curve of Blackjack Hill
That gal o Bobs on her pinto and that sneakin Handsome Harry on his
black mustang ridin fullbentforleather

The men rushed with one accord to Bobs cabin where he sat before his
fireless hearth

We alays knew he was a sneakin thief but you wouldnt hear nothin
agin him Took all the bags of gold dust from your claim too didnt
he

Now boys that isnt fair to call him a thief He was my partner and
what was mine was his and a man has a right to take his own wherever he
finds it

But the gal asked a chorus of voices

That girl wasnt in any way bound to me and you cant expect a pretty
creature like her to care for such a beauty as I am when theres a
fellow like Handsome Harry around It dont stand to reason

Come fellows said Poker Bill if Bobs satisfied I reckon we ought
to be Time to get into our biled shirts for the house warmin anyway

Sorry to disappoint you boys but there wont be a house warming I
built it for them and theyre gone Itll stay locked till they come
again This old cabin is good enough for me

So they left him Bob relit his pipe and settled back on his bench Once
he roused a moment to mutter But theyd ought to know me better They
neednt have run away from their best friend

Soon after dark a pinto paced home through the quiet mourning camp with
a very weary bulldog at her heels Beckey slid from her side saddle and
crept to Bobs open door By the light of a full moon she could see the
big lax figure in an attitude of utter despair

Bob

You Girl I thought youd gone

I went becausebecause I thought youd come after me Id tried
everything else that a woman can do to make you understand    Hes
begged me so many times to run off When he understood he was beastly
He put me off the horse and told me to walk then It was the dog who
fought him and then I ran for Pinto and came back Her low voice
failed her but she controlled herself and went on I thought if I
pretended to go youd see

See Girl youve known ever since you came creeping into Snake Gulch
that night that you were the very heart and soul of me

Yes yes she sobbed that is not what I would have you know

You meanno I am a great fool No woman could bring herself toA
face like mine Even if you did it would be from gratitude I could not
permit such a sacrifice he finished with a touch of pride

The girl waited then when he was silent she turned with a sob to go to
her mothers cabin The soft footfalls died away Bob stood motionless
Suddenly a scream rang out on the still night air Bulldoze scrambled
off the doorstone with a snarl of battlerage and charged for the
sound but he was easily outdistanced by the huge miner who ran with
the lithe grace of an Indian In an incredibly short time the little
form was safe in his arms

Oh theres a terrible animal in the mining ditch I heard it Its
coming this way A grizzley I know Bob peered into the ditch

Why girl its only drunken old Solly Jake going home holding his jug
out of the water He gets into the ditch so he wont lose the way

But how does he know when to get out

Well when he bangs his head on the overbrace of the first flume he
knows hes home and crawls out Bob began gently to withdraw his arms

If you let me go now she whispered Ill wish that it had been a
grizzley

I must take you home

Oh you have I am home clinging to him desperately I want no other
in the world than this one

But my scarred

The girl reached up drawing down his tall dark head in her arms She
kissed his mutilated cheek then pressed it tenderly against her soft
bare throat It did not stay long as Bob felt that such kisess should
be returned without delay

Huray cheered Solly Jake waving his whisky jug tale ended right
Time fr nother drink boys and standing up to his middle in water he
proceeded to demonstrate his idea

 Canfields Diary of a FortyNiner



The beautiful Casino at Monte Carlo stands in one of the loveliest
settings on earth Facing the blue Mediterranean and enhanced by the
exquisitely kept marble villas of Monaco it may justly be called the
acme of gambling institutions It has become an institution through the
years Time has brought it stability

Its absolute antithesis were the gambling dens of 49 Built overnight
destined to remain if the mines were rich and to melt away if they
pinched out the gambling hells were sometimes the veriest makeshifts
Canvas covered dirt floored except for the dancing platform rough
redwood bar and tables surrounded by all the sordidness of Hurdy
Gurdy town in which fortunes and reputations and lives were bid and
shuffled and lost as indiscriminately as grains of dust blown into the
everchanging sea

The thirst for gold is universal In those halfmad days of delirious
seeking the princeling rubbed sleeves with the scoundrel and the
clod and each mans ability was his only protection Fortune played
no favorites The tale is told of the judge who drove home in his coach
through a shallow creek Ruin faced him for the lack of a few thousand
dollars He took out his derringer and shot himself

Not half an hour later a Chinaman crossed the creek under his pole
between two swinging baskets He found a nugget there which brought him
over 30000

This then is the tale of what Fortune did to Curly Gillmore

    

Whoopee Kiyiee hickee Yieeee

There comes Curly said Teddy Karns never altering the steady flow
of the whiskey he was pouring into a tin cup for Sailor Jack to drink

Made a big strike I hear

Yeaah About 25000 they say Might be a million the way the female
critters run Ted laughed as the hurdygurdy girls with shrieks of
laughter pounced upon the noisy newcomer

Well hello Nance and Liz and Babe and Bouncin Bet old gal All
ready to help me sling it aint you But wheres little pale Alice

Oh Allie Shes back in the tents Sick tonight Awful bad shes
took Shell be shufflin off fore long an rid o mortal misery

Poor little soldier

Sweet she was an born to be good Why I remember we came round
the Horn on the same sailin vessel that they wasnt a ailin baby on
board but what Allie could get a smile out of it nor a sick soul that
didnt bless er for er kindness an care Sick o body sick o heart
Allie did for em all bless er

She was happy then put in Babe

Yes Comin out to Californy to er lover she were all her folks back
in the States bein dead Shed took care of er mother last Twas why

Aww Bet dont you cry said Babe Y see when we got here Curly
we found her boyd been shot in a fight over a mine Allie she hadnt
no money left and no gumption much like Bet an me to fight her way
so we took er along o us We tried to keep her the little lady that
she was butWell we got snowed in last winter up on the divide
anFaro SamWell it broke her pure heart an most Bets an mine
too An she aint never got over the cold she took up there in the
snow

Lifes hard for a girl anyways you put it an shell be happier over
the river where there aint no cold nor sorrer Bet Aww shell
sleep on a finer bed nor you an I could give er an wake happy with
everone she loved best around her Shes layin there so white an
small an still itd most break your hear to see er Like a little
snowdrop youve picked an worn an slung away So gentle

Well whats this anyway A wake broke in Faro Sams icy voice Do
I hire fiddlers to play a funeral dirge Get on with you scattering
the girls in the direction of the card tables and the dancing platform
Which ones do you want Curly

I want Babe and Betsy Wheres that little pale printers devil the
one they call the gamblers ghost I know Sam wont let you girls leave
here

Hes workin up on the paper I guess They ran out of coal oil and had
to fire up with pine knots

Hes comin now He aint no gamblers ghost tonight though hes pot
black

Ghost said Curly you take this around to Allie It was a 50
octagonal slug

Yessir

And you say that theres more all she wants where that comes from

Yessir

Then shaking his mop of brown curly hair as though to relieve his head
of a burden he took the girls for what he felt was a muchneeded round
of drinks

By midnight the place was wild

Sam shouted Curly whats the limit on your pesky old game

The ceilings the limit

Well Ill put up one bet Bein on Easy Street I was goin back to the
States to marry my girl but Im blamed if I dont put up my swag for
one turn of the cards

He sent for his dust and piled the long buckskin bags crisscross
before Faro Sams table

Ill copper the jack gentlemen he shouted All on the jack

Teddy Karns face turned a pasty hue and the tip of his tongue slid
along his puffed lips but the lines of Faro Sams face never changed
and his eyes retained the blank impassivity of a snakes as he slipped
his cards There was a sudden tense silence The girls pressed forward
with hurried breathing and the men waited rigid as stones

Somebodys mongrel paced to the middle of the platform and scratched for
fleas with soft thumping on the floor That was all

Suddenly a man swore A womans voice shrilled hysterically Faro Sam
rose to his feet ceremoniously The house is yours

By Jinks yelled Curly Ive coppered the jack Ive broken the bank
Ive

One of the doors swung open quietly Silence dropped once more with the
speed of tropical night upon the blare of the place

The gamblers ghost stood there silhouetted against the light from a
log fire outside There were pink streaks down his dirty face washed
by tears and his young shoulders drooped woefully The dog came forward
and licked his twitching fingers

Allie is dead he whispered

Curly I should like to apply for the position of dealer over at your
place which yesterday was my place said Faro Sam next day at noon
meeting Curly on the street

Sure you can have it Sam Too bad its the custom for the house to
go too when somebody breaks the bank Ive turned it over to George
Spellman with a thousand to start with He and I come from the same
place back in the States Great friends we were till we both got to
sparkin the same girl When she took me George he got pretty ornery
but I guess hes all over it by this time Im goin home to marry her
now

Ive just been around to the tents seein about little Allies funeral
an hell keep on the girls too Im pullin my freight for Hangtown
Placerville This towns a little too small for a fellow of my means

Faro Sam looked after him with a cynical light in his narrow eyes

The pot bubbles loudest when the waters nearest the bottom he
muttered and turned to pick a fastidious way through the mud

Life that night in the gambling hell went on much as usual Teddy Karns
poured the rye and Faro Sam slipped the cards whilst Babe worried
over Bouncing Bets intoxicated condition

Its Allie you know Babe confided to Red Shirt Pete at midnight
She took it awful hard and Spellman the new boss wouldnt let er
off tonight I bin tellin er Allies better off but she wont listen
to nobody Shes just bin pourin em down all evenin Whats that
at a loud banging on the doors Some one opened them and Curly rode into
the place on the handsome horse he had bought that morning

Well boys Im cleaned Tried to copper the jack in Hangtown and
the whole 50000 went George Ill be askin for this place back I
guess

This place belongs to me Curly Gillmore

Who says so

This old lady says so covering him with his pistol

Curly laughed not too musically Well boys what am I bid for this
horse I need a grubstake

Play you for him said Faro Sam laconically

Done said Curly A moment later he laughed once more and swung down
off the Spanish thoroughbred Hes yours Well goodnight boys

No one answered He had like Hadji the beggar become in twentyfour
hours again a drifter

Babe sneaked out after him Here Curly she slipped her hand into
her bosom and held out the octagonal slug When Bet an I reached Allie
last night she was holdin it in her little dead hand an there was
such a smile on her face You gave her that happy smile God bless you
for it Now you take this

But Curly turned away blinking his eyes and trying to swallow the lump
in his throat Babe stood watching him through her tears as he tramped
down the street out of the town on the road to the south

    

Two years later in a hall in Sonora a man strolled in to the card
tables

Why hello Curly

Curly glanced up briefly Hello George

Hear youve made another strike

You can hear a lot that aint true This happens to be

You know I was telling

Well the sight of you dont put me in the mood to be told much There
was an imperceptible shifting of the crowd around the table They were
moving away from Spellman

I was telling my wife

My girl you mean It wasnt enough to keep my business you had to go
home an marry my girl too didnt you

Curly for the love of heaven

Take your hand off my arm Pete Im going to kill this Hes not the
kind of man I thought he was

Two shots crashed in the room

Spellman wavered through the smoke haze then dropped his pistol and
fell slowly across the card table littered with shining cards and poker
chips An overturned tallowdip dropped in a pool of wine and rolled
down against the dead mans cheek dabbling it with the color which
would never return to it again

    

Bet aint that Curly Gillmore that we knew three years ago at Coloma
when Allie died

Must be agittin blind Where

The feller all dressed up an walkin with the lady Sure it is Hi
Curly hello Its Babe Well aint I glad

The woman with Curly fixed Babe with a stony glare If you wish
to converse with this woman kindly do so when your wife is not
accompanying you she said to him in an angry undertone and went
majestically on

Ill come back Babe Weve been married just a month and she doesnt
understand Ill be back later and he hurried off

Bet did you see who that was with Curly His wife he said

Aww Babe dont you fret I guess we fill our little place out here
in Californy near as much as some o the fine ladies do

I didnt care No I was thinkin that the ways o the Lord are
curious That lady used to be married to George Spellman

An Curly shot him down at Sonora last year

Yeaw

Well Ill be




The Race of the Shoestring Gamblers

VIII

 Judge not too idly that our toils are mean
 Though no new levies marshall on our green
 Nor deem too rashly that our gains are small
 Weighed with the prizes for which heroes fall

 Bret Harte



If dancing was the first form of amusement to emanate from prehistoric
savagery then racing must surely have come next It may possibly have
come first However we shall leave the theorizin to be settled by
the lips of the first mummy whose centuriesold tissues shall be roused
to full life by modern science What has science not achieved We have
gone beyond wonder We can only believe and become blase

Meantime there is still enough red blood in the modern effete
productions of humans to enjoy a contest of stress and strain and brain
and brawn and to gamble upon the outcome

In the 49 days racing was one of the most popular forms of chance and
it often reverted in bizarre tangents This then is what happened at a
golden fiesta during the week of races

Sweet Lady are all my importunities to be in vain

I must confess that I can not bring my mind to a decision Mr Saul
answered Mistress Patty Laughton blushing and curtsying prettily

It is surely not for your lack of worldly goods that you hesitate
persisted Slickheels Saul As for what your father is owing me it
shall at the moment of your acceptance be wiped entirely from the
books

Patty was incensed at the hint of insolence in the gamblers allusion to
her improvident fathers financial condition

Believe me Mr Saul she said with spirit no ulterior motive for
worldly advancement has the power to coerce my afflections

But you will consider my proposition of marriage

Pattys honest gaze encountered the appraising glint in the coot grey
eyes of the foppish scapegrace before her She lowered her own eys
quickly to hid a hunted look in their dark depths as she answered

Sir after the week of races you shall have your answer

And then I shall give up my present means of gaining a livelihood and
repairing to San Francisco shall enter into a profession more fitting
the social station of the lady who is to become my wife He bowed
deeply and withdrew leaving Patty with a sad face and tearfilled eyes

At last she straightened her tall figure resolutely I must not give
way to tears I can not I will not There must be some way to pay
my fathers debts beside this extremity to which death is almost
preferable There is still a weeks time A weekonly a week Panic
overwhelmed her and when someone gently took her hand she cried aloud
in terror

Why Sweetheart do I frighten you so I waited long upon the mesa near
the speedtrack at the spot we had agreed upon and when you did not
come I fared forth to meet you

Eric it is Saul again What can I do

Dear I have about 2000 which I am resolved to play on the races I
will win I must Old Irish Mike has brought over his whole stableful
of saddle horses and I was raised in Kentucky Do not despair we shall
beat the gambler at his own game Here is Mike now PerhapsMike its
a fine string of horses youve picked up

It is so Many a thoroughbred Ive bought that came all the way from
Kentucky or Missouri All that had the stamina to get to Californy the
one thing left that many of the poor devils could sell when they reached
the coast

Mike some of them are faster than others I suppose

Tis what half the shoestring gamblers in the camp have tried to find
out I may have me own opinion but its to meself Ill kape it till
afther the races are run I will not spile sport Have ye seen the last
cayuse thats bein put in

You mean the cow pony that came in with the bunch of cattle from the
Napa Valley yesterday

The same The auld boy whilst in his cups is bettin she can beat
anythin on four legs even jack rabbits an antelope The precious
gamblin riffraff are fillin him up with tanglefoot proper

Why Mike Mike glanced at the silent girl and then down into the
gulch below

Miss Patty have ye visited the claims

No but I should like to

Come then if ye will so pleasure an old man The men will not be
workin tomorrow They will be that pleased to show a lady how to wash
a pan o dirt they will be saltin ivery pan wit nuggets for ye Eric
lad he called back to the tall young man ye might look the cow horse
over She has not been curried for long yet whisper beauty is but
skin deep an the finest rapier is often encased in a rusty scabbard

There is something going forward that Mike wishes me to see though
Eric as he hurried off to the livery stable That is why he took Patty
away

A crowd of gamblers were just putting up a pair of riders on two horses

Hey Eric Tallman you used to own this horse Can he beat this
rattailed kyoodle that runs after steers

Eric laid a hand fondly on the magnificent black half breed who had
just enough mustang to give him the stamina and spirit and wildness
characteristic of the Spanishbred horse

Keep him on a steady rein and hell beat anything in the mountains Id
never have sold him except He sighed turning to the cattle horse
She was long necked long legged long haired walleyed lean and
badly in need of currying and yet Irish Mike was no fool and Mike knew
Erics extremityhis and the girls whom he loved

He noted the deep broad chest the tapering barrel and the tremendous
driving power in the steel muscles of the hind quarters but she
drooped spiritless He turned again to the satincoated halfbreed

Any dust up yet

Yeaw about ten thousand Old fool seems to be well heeled Weve got
im full to the eyes down at Stringhalt Eddies place an the boys
are goin to try the plugs out before they put up any more Two trial
races were ridden and the sad cow horse was outrun with apparent ease

The next morning as Patty went on her daily stroll to take the air
her way was blocked by a clamoring crowd of undesirables who were
baiting a miserable old cattle man

I tell ye gentlemen I was indisposed Twas the liquor talking
Surely you would not take advantage of a poor old man and his honest
hardworking little mount Every day of her life she works Gentlemen I
beg you

Begging will get you nothing better than a good drubbing you filthy
cattle lout If you dont pay up your bets well take it out of your
hide I for one have a special use for my money at the weeks end

It was Slickheels Saul Patty turned aside sick at heart This was the
creature in whose power she was like to fall

Upon her return she found the old cowboy sitting dejectedly under a
liveoak bush Sir she began timidly you are in trouble I should
like to express my sympathy

He rose with suspicious nimbleness Now bless your kind heart Miss
to stop to console a sad old man

I overheard what Mr Saul said to you sir He is

Without doubt without doubt he is everything you mention Could you
now be Mistress Patty Laughton of Kentucky

Yes sir

I knew your Grandfather Laughton my child and since I came here I
have heardof you he finished with innate delicacy Indeed who had
not heard her story

She opened her silken reticule and drew forth a small buckskin bag
Will you not accept it Yesterday at the claims I panned it out
myself I am sorry for your plight I am sorry for anyone in the
clutches of Slickheels Saul

But Can you

It does not matter Your extremity is greater than mine

He stood looking after the slim girl who carried her head so high How
like a Kentucky Laughton Thoroughbred stock all He tossed the bag
in his hand Tis why they are where they are today Then his keen old
eyes softened And why they are what they are today Bless her tender
heart to stoop to an old cattle man in the mire As for thisI must see
Irish Mike and he hurried off with surprising speed

Bets rose Every gambler had been apprised of the sure thing and flocked
to the betting like bears to a honey tree

Have ye put up yer money Eric asked Irish Mike late the next
night

Yes said Eric briefly

Ah So Mikes shrewd gave slid from the young mans face

They do say that Slickheels Saul is beginnin to worry over
the 20000 hes staked The shoestring gang have gathered in the
information frm th express agent that the auld cattle man owns a
big Spanish grant down in the valley and has 5000 to his credit in
certificates of deposit from the express company Tis as good as gold

Mike have you ever seen him before

I never spile sport me boy

It was the last day of the fiesta and the famous race was at hand

There is the old cattle man with his vaqueros

Faith theyre a tough lookin lot all armed with a brace o Colts
apiece Tis fun theyd have cleanin out a Fandango House

Patty girl you are pale today

Oh Eric tis the last day of grace Heaven help us if

See Patty girrrl theyre fixin for the foot race between Cherokee
Bob an that Australian squirt frm Sacramento

Why are they placing men with guns every ten feet along the track

The Indian can beat the Australian but he thried to sell the boys
out an if he slackens his gait by ever so little the bys will begin
shootin sthraight before them An maybe afther the race hed better
be runnin right on into the next county

What next

Next is a jackass fight an then the race

After the billigerent jacks had been led away Red Pete suddenly took to
the brush accelerated by a fusillade of bullets

Welchin his bets he is an ivery man he owes is lettin him have
it

Nary a hit wailed old Jack Horner The shootin in this camp is
agittin vile Time we was quittin so d much pick handlin an
apracticin up Its a reflection on the community Why there aint
been a Chinaman drilled with a bullet decent an clean for weeks

Theyre leading out the horses Where did that little nigger jockey
come from The mares got more ginger today

Eric surely your horse can win

I dont know dear

He must He must or

Slickheels Sauls face is turnin the color of me native isle
chuckled Irish Mike Patty me little ladybird tis no time to be
faintin

Oh you cant know

Faith an I know more than you tink Bear up Asthore the darkest
hour is just forninst the dawn Whisht now Theyre off

Here they come The black is ahead See the nigger is lying flat on
the mares neck Shes closing up Oh they are neck and neck I cannot
look EricThe black is getting the whip Good horse They are even
again Ah it is only for a moment The mare is over the line
first It is all ended life love honor happiness I cannot
belong to that man My poor old father Dear old for his sake I
must I

Patty girl

Eric you are not to blame You would wager on your own horse Tis but
natural I must accept my fate with what fortitude I can summon Please
take me home All the people staring I cannot bear it long

But when Slickheels Saul pressed forward to her side at the
boardinghouse steps she was as stately and cold as the snowhooded
rocks of Granite Mountain

I have lost everything but still I hold you to your promise

I made no promise sir she said haughtily

But you will he answered meaningly tomorrow

Stand aside thundered Eric

Come awn soothed Irish Mike Not with the lady here Eric by

Patty I cannot let you go I will shoot the beast on sight

That would not vindicate my fathers honor Hush he is coming I must
remember that I am a Laughton

Eric turned to stare moodily out the dusty window There goes the
cattle man with his followers and his strongbox What he must have won
Here comes Mike In a hurry too I wonder

Slickheels Saul was bowing before the girl

Forgive an auld Irishman for intrudin upon so tender a scene
Slickheels glared at him malevolently but I have heere a
something for Mistress Patty Laughton pretending to read the
inscription on the package he held out from the auld boy there who
is just leavin us

Bread cast upon the waters of sweet charity shall be returned an
hundred fold Blessed are the pure in heart for they are of the children
of God he has written Why it is money gasped Patty and such a
large amount

He had me put up yer little bag o gold on his mare These are yer
winnings Mike smiled inwardly at the sum of money Sure auld Andy
must have put a rock or two in the wee buckskin bag he thought but
aloud he said I never spile sport an I could not tell ye before
but tis auld Andy Magee an his famous racin mare the fastest quarter
mile horse bechune the state of Missouri and the Pacific ocean

Tis the same game hes pulled on the gamblin crooks all the way
from the Oregon line to Mariposa in the south Even gettin filled wit
tanglefoot is part of the dodge They cannot touch him an the vaqueros
protect him frm the shootin

But what about the tryout

Also in the schame The mare was crossshod meanin two of her shoes
the near front an the off hind wans were twice as heavy as the others
She could not run top speed in thm fr love nor gold Yesterday she
was shod in light racin pads an under her own jockey No horse on the
coast could catch her An always the smart racin gamblers play th
auld man for a fool Such is often the end of greed

Pay up the dads gamblin debts an bid this Knight o the Green Cloth
a swate an long fareyewell Then go an be happy me child




The Dragon and the Tomahawk

IX

 Which I wish to remark
 And my language is plain
 That for ways that are dark
 And for tricks that are vain
 The heathen Chinee is peculiar
 Which the same I would rise to explain

 Bret Harte


Certain learned archaeologists maintain that there are marked racial
similarities between the American Indians and the Chinesephysical
characteristics dating from unknown centuries when the widely sundered
continents were probably one

However that may be in the days of gold in California the greatest
animosity existed between the Indians and the Chinamen The feeling
began presumably through intermarriage and flourished like the
celebrated milkweed vine of the foothills which has been known
to growI quote a 49er now dead which is perhaps taking an
advantage12 inches in a day

The tale is told of a Chinaman crossing a suspension footbridge high
over a winter torrent from one part of a mining camp to another An
Indian ran to meet him John Chinaman started back as quickly as he
could on the swaying bridge The faster Indian caught him and though
miners on both shores sought to save the unfortunate Chink by a rain
of bullets it was too long range and the Indian threw him to certain
death in the river

But the Indians did not always win and this then is the tale of an
encounter between Hop Sing and Digger Dan

In a game which held accountin On an old Sierra mountain

    

Whassa malla too much nailo ketchem cloe clothes snorted Hop
Sing coming around to the side verandah with two pins in his hand
to where Miss Jo Halstead was embroidering an antimacassar in bright
worsteds

Oh Sing did you hurt your hand she cried

Nother boy heap mad

Another boy Arent you doing the washing

No do Me but Jo had gone to the back yard She found the tallest
Chinaman she had ever seen meekly bending to the washing and quickly
obeying the sharp orders rained upon his queuecircled poll by Hop Sing

ButSing protested Jo stifling any sort of smile

Him no good No got place Me pay onedollarhop him stop one month
Chinee house He no pay Me makem work

Yes butwhat is that Those are shots on the stage road over the
hill Oh it must be another holdup And Rand is shotgun messenger on
the stage today Hark Hear the horses running Theyre comingfast
Theyre trying to make the town

Ketchem more horse run behind answered Sing listening intently his
slanting eyes glittering

Sing you go and see what

Can do You get that boy make em wash alle same He no good You
look see Joe turned to spy the frightened deputy washerman wriggling
under the verandah Bimeby I kill um remarked Sing composedly No
got time now Missie Jo wagon come maybeso better you stop houseo

Six horses topped the long hill pulling the huge rockaway stage They
were coming at full speed and the near wheeler was dripping with blood
A dead man hung over the high dashboard where his feet had caught when
he fell

Leaning far out over the team was a young man holding the reins in one
hand while he lashed the shotcrazed horses to their last ounce of
speed with the fifteenfoot whip His sawedoff shotgun lay on the seat
beside him It was Rand

Oh thank God moaned Joe but in another moment Poor old Salt
Peter They must have killed him when he wouldnt stop Sing but Hop
Sing had vanished leaving only his white apron across the wash bench

As the stage thundered around the turn at the end of the main street
the wounded horse threw up his head coughed bloody spume over the
pointers the second pair and fell Men were already scrambling onto
their horses and loping in from all directions Rand cut out a buckskin
leader mounted and dashed frantically back up the road followed by a
dozen horsemen

Rand who was it

I dont know exactly Thought I saw Digger Dan They were over the
hill and Jo heard no more

Hop Sing did not turn up for supper but his tall substitute did fairly
well and Jo did not worry Some time after dark a weary Rand appeared

Well Miss Jo we got Digger Dan At least we thought it was but he
wont say a word except that he wants to see you Ive come to escort
you over to the jail Will you trust yourself to me that far

That far yes archly tis but a short space Not for worlds would
she have him guess her anxiety of the afternoon

I wish that twere for always

What can Digger Dan want of me she evaded thankful for the darkness
which hid her blushes Rand hear the wolves howling

They are only coyotes dearMiss Joe and afraid to venture into town
except to the chicken roosts

Why its Hop Sing exclaimed Jo upon first sight of the prisoner
Theyve cut off half his queue and braided his hair in two pig tails
and put different clothes on him and he does look like an Indian How
very extraordinary

Kethem Digger Dan cloe blazed Sing

Thats a likely tale said the sheriff betcha he knows more about
stage robbin than hell let out

I am sure he does not about this one He was with me every moment
Nevertheless she could not help remembering the substitute Chinaman
whom Sing had put in to do his washing But though the complex Oriental
nature will never be quite understood by the Occidental she had
confidence in the loyalty of the Chinaman who had served them for five
years and whose life had once been saved by her father

Ah Sing will you tell me what happened she asked knowing well that
a command would only elicit a stolid No savvey Put as a favor or a
confidence he might respond

Him Digger Dan no good He stealem me cloe Ketchem Missa Land
Rand an plenty man come he lun run I ketchem him Tlee three
lobber robber come Too muchee men I no can fight He

They tied him on a horse and drove it down the canyon for us to follow
while they got away

I tell you he knows more about it than hes telling

I dont think so sheriff said Rand positively The man turned to
him suspiciously

Me go home all same Missie Joe Hop Sing raised an expressionless
face and glared at the broad belt of the sheriff

Well you can go but Im going to keep an eye on you and see that
your aprons hanging in the Halsteads kitchen every day of your heathen
life

Later that night when Rand started home strange incantations were going
on in Sings leanto In four china bowls punk was burning and an old
Chinaman was muttering weird invocations over the clothes of Digger Dan
slowly smouldering in a coaloil can in the middle of the floor Hop
Sing held one hand in the smoke raised the other aloft and made a
bloodcurdling oath of some sort which by the expression of his face
probably consigned the owner forever more to the nethermost depths of
Tophet

Why where is Ali Sing asked Jo the next morning when she found the
tall slave still in the kitchen

He got heap sick cousin He go way I stay He come back bimeby Jo
knew that it was useless to question further

The summer drifted by and still Sing did not return Rand walked in
one day with the first flurry of snow from his claim in the south He
caught both of Jos hands in his without a word kissed them tenderly
and let them go

Rand she faltered it is so long since Ive heard from you You have
been acting so strangelyfor months

Jo have you not heard the talk that has been whispered with my name
ever since Sing disappeared They say that I know too much about the
holdups that I helped the Chinaman to escape that Digger Dan and Hop
Sing are one that

I would not listen to such falsehoods cried the girl her grey eyes
flashing

You blessed little woman But considering this how can I say to you
whattell you that which glorifies the very life in my frame How can I
offer you a name tarnished by the suspicions of my fellow men

Rand I acknowledge no such allegations Oh I may be lost to all sense
of womanly reserve but

When my name is cleared I shall hope to enter Paradise Till then I
must not I cannot bring disgrace upon you I shall return to my old
post of shotgun messenger

 Rand No Listen to me one moment Last evening Digger Dan came to
this very place He told me that if you went back to the stage you would
certainly be killed They have been robbing all summer It is said that
Joaquin is in the mountains

No they are Tom Bells men

Jo glanced up startled Whoever it is has sent you a warning

Miz Halstead called a strident voice th stages jest in an
youre paws took awful sick up on the Middle Fork at his mine

I shall have to go on the morning stage Will you not please to
Rand

Jo I do not fear death It is dishonor that maddens me for your sake
The snows have come They are already fitting runners to the stages The
mails and the dust must get through in spite of all I go out on the
first sleigh this one you must take This winter I shall vindicate my
name if it is humanly possible to do so He kissed the end of one long
curl of her hair and was gone

Some weeks later during a lull between storms Rands face lit up with
the feeling which but one woman in the world could inspire as the stage
pulled in to Middle Fork

Father is not quite recovered but I thought it best to get him out
before we were snowed in Rand Digger Dan came she added in a
whisper the stage will be stopped today Yet it is gathering for a
storm I dare not stay What shall I do

Come along I will protect you

Two miles further as they topped a hill Texas the driver pulled the
laboring six far to the side

Why asked Rand

Cut there answered Texas an its piled high with a drift

Look out for stumps

Ive got em spotted muttered Tex

Whats that swinging his gun quickly to the right The horses
plunged snorting quickly to the left the sleigh hit a snowcovered
stump and it was only Texs expert driving that saved it from
overturning

Some animal I saw his hide A hide Rand had seen but it was the
coyoteskin coat of an Indian who had made one sign and instantly
vanished Very quickly the dreaded halt came

Look out Tex Theres a rifle barrel from behind that tree trunk

Halt

Halt it is Theres nothing we can do Was it Jos presence in the
stage below that made him give in without a struggle or did he know
that the WellsFargo box had vanished from under the drivers seat Or
was it knowledge of the horde of yelling Indians which rose from the
snowy brush and swooped down upon the shooting robbers Four of them
were brought in triumph to the town on the stage

Where is the express box asked the sheriff

I do not know answered Rand defiantly

Cached away up on the mountain I suppose where the others are

Sir thundered Rand I have brought in the bandits as I promised
to clear my own namenall but Digger Dan who escaped When I say
that I do not know what happened to the box you will please understand
that

Here comes Digger Dan now carrying something

No Indian ever carried anything in baskets slung on a pole

Hello Missie Jo how you do blandly remarked Digger Dans double

Hop Sing

Ketchem Missa Lands money nis basakit

Whats in the other one

Nat one lock rock Makern heap easy carryem

Where did you get the box

You savvey place him horse get scare him wagon he fa over topside
down Him money he fa out Him stop place snow melt away by heap big
tlee tlunk Me see Missa Land I know he like I ketchem

When Rand took Jo home they were met by a smiling Sing in a snowy white
apron

Wheres the other boy asked Jo

Him boy I tellum get out quick or I killum sure

Ah Sing how can I ever thank you for all the six months youve spent
in the brush

He allli Massa Land You ketchem me come out nat jail I heap savvey
you come see Missie Jo Missie papa loong time now he ketchee me no
die Missie Jo alla same my girlo

Those Indians

Me hope you ketchem plenty boy From his point of view what greater
blessing could he wish them Later he peeked in curiously from the
kitchen but as kisses are not included in the Chinese curriculum he
failed to be interested and returned to his baking




The Barstow Lynching

X

 This is my story sir a trifle indeed I assure you
 Much more perchance might be said
 but I hold him of all men most lightly
 Who swerves from the truth in his tale No thank you
 Well since you are pressing
 Perhaps I dont care if I do you may give me the same
 Jimno sugar

 Bret Harte



Contests of every sort were the order of the day in 49 Any ferocious
encounter which would promulgate betting was countenanced and even
encouraged There were dog fights bull fights bobcat or mountain lynx
fights and fights between game chickens

The tale is even told of cootie fights during long rainy winter
evenings which must be spent indoors The harborers of the contestants
simply reached under their shirts drew forth a doughty greybacked
warrior placed him on a childs slate which was used as an arena and
the fight was on

A camp named Lousy Level is said to have made a specialty of this sort
of battle Thousands of dollars were sometimes bet upon the outcome
Arguments arising from various combats often developed into robbing
murdering and lynching This then is the tale of a certain lynching

    

Step up gents Only a dollar to see the big fight One little dollar
to view the greatest contest of the age See the champion fighting
jackass of the state vanquish the biggest grizzly in the Sierra
mountains

The unconquerable battling jackass who has whipped two bulls down at
Sonora and caused a mountain lion to turn tail Step up gents Only
a dollar to get inside the ropes and Webfoot Watson waved a wellkept
hand toward the arena It was a pinestaked palisade bound around the
top with rawhide thongs At one end the champion donk was tethered
and at the other the fiercest grizzly was confined in a stout cage of
solid planks

Step in gents There are logs and stumps to stand on The show will
begin immediately We are now loosing the lioneating jack He

Hey roared Swipeeye Weller pointing to the laden trees outside the
enclosure ef you think Im agoin to pay a dollar for this here show
jest because I aint no treeclimbin animal youre pickin out the
wrong customer They coughs up a screamer apiece or this act dont
begin actin Thats final

Nothing loath Webfoot claimed the penalty from the crowd perched in the
trees in some instances not without the aid of his sixshooter and the
jack was then turned loose in the palisade

Hes eatin grass piped up old Greasetop Jamie Say I can see
twenty jackasses eatin down to the boardin house at Blue Tent any
day an I dont have to pay no dollar neither Turn out yer baar

Hi Here he comes Eat im up jack Why that aint no grizzly
Sufferin stars hes only a little scared cinnamon

Hes goin after misterolddonk though

Yeaw Lookin fer protection Hey look at the donk landin kicks
on is ribs Ride im baar Claw im up Give im but the little
cinnamon bear reached the fence in three jumps scaled it and took
to the greasewood thickets in record time in spite of the yells and
bullets of the disgruntled spectators

Webfoot had made even better time than the bear and only the placid
jack remained as a memento of the occasion He was taken at the head of
a long procession of miners and made the occasion for a call upon the
whole round of fandango houses and dispensaries of liquid rowdyism in
the camp

Partners arent you getting somewhat rough with the little fellow
asked a young man in unimpeachable black broadcloth

Why its Anthony Barstow Look at the purple raiment Man you must
have struck pay dirt

Yes thank you my claim has turned out to be a rich one What will you
take for the donk

Help yourself Hes a maverick Whats that Dog fight Sic im
Rover and the fickle and drinkbefuddled mob hurried off down the
street to the newest excitement

Anthony took half an apple from his pocket I was saving it for
tomorrow but do you think you could manage it Little Pard The
long ears lifted at once and the soft hairy muzzle took the delicacy
daintily out of his fingers Anthony petted him and sauntered on into
the best of the gambling halls He seated himself at a table presided
over by a woman dealer

Monsieur it is not permitted zat ze gamblair shall play she told him
courteously with a flash of very beautiful white teeth

Ho Ho Barstow roared Copperdown Hicks Thats one on you The
madam here sees your brand new togs and thinks you tickle the green
cloth for a livin

It is monsieurs toilette zat ave cause ze mistake I have now better
observe hes face He is welcome

Dont think your friend can sit in though observed Champerdown
grinning broadly

Anthony turned The donkey had followed him in and was standing just
behind his chair head hanging ears lopping lethargic patience showing
in every contour of his shaggy body

I have consorted with many of his kind said Anthony smiling and I
prefer his frank sincerity his bravery under stress his worldly poise
his calm exterior which does conceal the fiery depths of his nature
in fact all his socalled animal attributes I prefer to the more
sophisticated allure of his human gender Anthony laid a strong hand
on the little beasts shoulder while the French woman regarded him
curiously out of long black eyes

There take that you good for nothing cur and a man kicked a dog in
through the door to lie in a twisted bloody heap upon the floor

What do you mean you brute called Anthony springing upon the miner
who immediately closed with him Mignon screamed and ran to stop them

Monsieur for why you do

Aw he got licked I lost money on him

Yes and you havent paid me neither You shell out you Buckeye
Pete spoke up a tall Kentuckian with a mastiff on a leash

It wasnt a fair fight Spotty Collins whined Buckeye

It wasit was so called a chorus of voices

Ill buy your dog said Anthony That will pay your debts Anthony
handed the money to Collins picked up the half dead dog and holding
him against his immaculate new frilled shirt he strode away toward
his claim over the mountain The jack whose attitude had hair never
changed by so much as the waving of a suddenly raised an alert head and
as his benefactor vanished he ambled quickly after him

Pete sought to stop him at the door and in one lightning and concerted
movement he bit and struck and kicked scattering the crowd in all
directions When the men watching Anthony down the street burst into
laughter at the bizarre procession the French girl silenced them with
fierce hissing syllables

Heh Dude Anthony beloved of the b

Zose words you shall not call la petite hound an me Even name of a
dog is for such as you too good to be call Monsieur we take pleasaire
in your departure from hence

Go on please the lady Buckeye Theres no other jackass to keep you
here any longer

And Buckeye departed in a perfect indigo haze of profanity

    

Mignon have you heard the news

Non Monsieur I ave sleep all ze day

Spotty Collins was found in Blue Ravine this morning robbed and
murdered You see he had a lot of money on him from the dog fight

But ze beeg hound

He was shot too

Ze murderer zey ave caught

Not yet They say the sheriffs on his trail though He just got back
from Sacramento and he went right out By jinks hes coming now An
hes got im

Mon Dieu It is Monsieur Antony

No

Oui Heem my womans heart knows well

By jinks you must be right Theres the fightin jack followin the
horses Dude Anthony of all people

It is not true It cannot be

Think Ive got my man boys His clothes are covered with blood and the
money was in his cabin

I have just made a strike in my claim That is my own money

Yes of course but the court thinks you oughtnt to keep it too long

The court is in his cups Hes sittin over there in the plaza with
his back against the flag pole an he wont budge You listen

Judge can I see you to your room for a few hours sleep

What for asked the judge eyeing the questioner solemnly Is there
anything in the statutes of the State of California which forbids my
preempting this small space on the highway Is there any reason if
I am so inclined that I should not teach my fellowcitizens the great
moral lesson of the overthrow and debasement of genius by the demon
rum Am I not better employed than if in a stifling tobaccoperfumed
courtroom beating law into the thick skull of a lawyer who doesnt
know Blackstone from white quartz But if you have four bits on you
and should ask me to join youAh you have

Well said the sheriff to Anthony after they had vanished into a near
bar Ill have to put you in the jug till court convenes

    

Buckeye Pete was celebrating He seemed to be suddenly flush with dust
and was dispensing drinks with a liberality which soon brought him a
numerous following By midnight it was a wellmellowed assemblage

Mignon how long have you been dealin

About tree four mont Monsieur

I dont mean here I mean altogether

About six year Monsieur

You must be well off by this time An they say that youve earned it
all workin and that youre straight Say Ill marry you if you say
the word

You say they say too much Monsieur

Here Dont you go givin me no orders you French crinoline fluff

I ordair no man an no man is ordair me She stared him down with her
glittering black eyes and returned to her dealing Pete strolled out
followed by his satellites When the noises in the street grew louder it
caused no particular comment It was the usual thing But when a crowd
burst into the Royal Flush Mignon sprang to her feet with a cry of
anguish

Dealt me a raw deal didnt yeh you smart Frenchie gloated Buckeye
Pete Well look at your man Take a good look an dont miss the
necktie hes wearin Pretty lil rope choker we got for Dandy Anthony
Aint no man can go killin an get away with it while Im here
looking around for applause

Name of a pig hissed Mignon Youyou would

Sure we would Right out on the lynchin tree She turned and dashed
for the rear Ze sheriff He must come toute suite

Min whispered Softsoap Joe the bartender he left two hours ago on
a new case otherwise they wouldnt adared do this

Mon Dieu An ze justice he is intoxicate Mother Marie pray for
him she cried in her own language and she ran after the lynching
party

Once she stopped shaking with terror at what she took to be a grizzly
in the path It was only the fighting donkey still following the master
whom he had adopted He made his way to the very center of the mob The
French girl followed and climbing onto a barrel faced the crowd with
flashing eyes

Consider what you do The judgment of le bon Dieu will be upon you

Aw Choke her off Pull her down somebody

But the three or four who tried to reach Mignon on her barrel next to
the bound man on the horse beneath the hanging tree fell victim to the
greatest battling jack in the state

My friend orated the old judge afterwards in describing these
events what mere man however filled with tanglefoot could face the
wicked teeth and hoofs and kicks which had conquered wild Texas bulls
caused the mountain lion to cringe in his lair and the invincible
grizzly to flee across the Sierras

At any rate the little donkey was everywhere at once biting striking
kicking squealing with the venom and speed and precision of a
rattlesnake while Mignon railed unmindful of Anthonys protests

Ze blood on hees clothes Bah You ave all see ow he is carry home
la petite sohurt dog Oui ze dog of Monsieur Pete Who is know where
Monsieur Collins is go for new dog fight Monsieur Pete Who has anger
at Monsieur Antony for because I Mignon ave look once again at
Monsieur who is so kind to all who I ave pain Monsieur Pete Who is
insult good girl Thats me Monsieur Pete Who is spend much money
tonight who yesterday was brroke Monsieur Pete Who zen should you
swing on ze rope

She waited There was absolute silence save for the crackle of the
flaming pinepitch torches

Ver well in a low voice I me Mignon shall answer Again she
paused A long way down the canyon she heard horses galloping on the
hard road Monsieur Pete she screamed at the top of her voice

The mob struggled forward yelling

Ver well she cried snatching a silvermounted pistol out of her
bosom Come on Ze jackass he is keell five I Mignon I keell
five Ten shall go to le diable before mon brave shall hang

They hesitated those in front pressing back from the certain death
which awaited them Mignon set her arms akimbo the gun gleaming at her
hip and taunted them in contemptuous French

The horsemen had reached the camp and soon thundered into view Whats
this going on anyway demanded the sheriff angrily Anthony Barstow
is innocent These men can prove that they spent the night at Barstows
cabin When I learned the truth I came straight back Buckeye Pete you
throw up your hands Youre wanted for the murder of Spotty Collins

Mignon tore the noose from Anthonys neck laughing and crying in true
French abandon

Anthony youre snared in another kind of noose laughed the sheriff
I know youre need in your arms but that ripsnortin little jack
wont let me get near enough to cut your bonds

By Salsifer he said later on Ill have to swear that fighting jack
in as a deputy sheriff and set him to watchin road agents confined in
the jail Well goodnight all Petes locked up safe and sound

An hour later a sober band of grim spectres returned to the jail
overpowered the guard and for the second time that night took out
grisly fruit to hang on the lynching tree There were no pine knots and
no attempts at conversation till the leader asked Buckeye Pete have
you anything to say before you join your Maker

Aint no use prayin for yourself spoke up another voice Better
pray for the soul of the man you sent to Purgatory and for the
wellbein of the other innocent man you tried to destroy

Whats that

Its that fightin jack prowlin round

Let im prowl Now then boys are you ready Then pull and as the
old judge always told in conclusion they say as the men gave a mighty
heave on the rope the donkey ran forward and kicked the barrel from
under the doomed mans feet
