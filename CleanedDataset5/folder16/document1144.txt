IN THE CAGE


CHAPTER I


It had occurred to her early that in her positionthat of a young person
spending in framed and wired confinement the life of a guineapig or a
magpieshe should know a great many persons without their recognising
the acquaintance That made it an emotion the more livelythough
singularly rare and always even then with opportunity still very much
smotheredto see any one come in whom she knew outside as she called
it any one who could add anything to the meanness of her function Her
function was to sit there with two young menthe other telegraphist and
the counterclerk to mind the sounder which was always going to dole
out stamps and postalorders weigh letters answer stupid questions
give difficult change and more than anything else count words as
numberless as the sands of the sea the words of the telegrams thrust
from morning to night through the gap left in the high lattice across
the encumbered shelf that her forearm ached with rubbing This
transparent screen fenced out or fenced in according to the side of the
narrow counter on which the human lot was cast the duskiest corner of a
shop pervaded not a little in winter by the poison of perpetual gas
and at all times by the presence of hams cheese dried fish soap
varnish paraffin and other solids and fluids that she came to know
perfectly by their smells without consenting to know them by their names

The barrier that divided the little postandtelegraphoffice from the
grocery was a frail structure of wood and wire but the social the
professional separation was a gulf that fortune by a stroke quite
remarkable had spared her the necessity of contributing at all publicly
to bridge When Mr Cockers young men stepped over from behind the
other counter to change a fivepound noteand Mr Cockers situation
with the cream of the Court Guide and the dearest furnished apartments
Simpkins Ladles Thrupps just round the corner was so select that
his place was quite pervaded by the crisp rustle of these emblemsshe
pushed out the sovereigns as if the applicant were no more to her than
one of the momentary the practically featureless appearances in the
great procession and this perhaps all the more from the very fact of the
connexion only recognised outside indeed to which she had lent herself
with ridiculous inconsequence She recognised the others the less
because she had at last so unreservedly so irredeemably recognised Mr
Mudge However that might be she was a little ashamed of having to
admit to herself that Mr Mudges removal to a higher sphereto a more
commanding position that is though to a much lower neighbourhoodwould
have been described still better as a luxury than as the mere
simplification the corrected awkwardness that she contented herself
with calling it He had at any rate ceased to be all day long in her
eyes and this left something a little fresh for them to rest on of a
Sunday During the three months of his happy survival at Cockers after
her consent to their engagement she had often asked herself what it was
marriage would be able to add to a familiarity that seemed already to
have scraped the platter so clean Opposite there behind the counter of
which his superior stature his whiter apron his more clustering curls
and more present too present _h_s had been for a couple of years the
principal ornament he had moved to and fro before her as on the small
sanded floor of their contracted future She was conscious now of the
improvement of not having to take her present and her future at once
They were about as much as she could manage when taken separate

She had none the less to give her mind steadily to what Mr Mudge had
again written her about the idea of her applying for a transfer to an
office quite similarshe couldnt yet hope for a place in a biggerunder
the very roof where he was foreman so that dangled before her every
minute of the day he should see her as he called it hourly and in a
part the far NW district where with her mother she would save on
their two rooms alone nearly three shillings It would be far from
dazzling to exchange Mayfair for Chalk Farm and it wore upon her much
that he could never drop a subject still it didnt wear as things _had_
worn the worries of the early times of their great misery her own her
mothers and her elder sistersthe last of whom had succumbed to all
but absolute want when as conscious and incredulous ladies suddenly
bereft betrayed overwhelmed they had slipped faster and faster down
the steep slope at the bottom of which she alone had rebounded Her
mother had never rebounded any more at the bottom than on the way had
only rumbled and grumbled down and down making in respect of caps
topics and habits no effort whateverwhich simply meant smelling much
of the time of whiskey




CHAPTER II


It was always rather quiet at Cockers while the contingent from Ladles
and Thrupps and all the other great places were at luncheon or as the
young men used vulgarly to say while the animals were feeding She had
forty minutes in advance of this to go home for her own dinner and when
she came back and one of the young men took his turn there was often half
an hour during which she could pull out a bit of work or a booka book
from the place where she borrowed novels very greasy in fine print and
all about fine folks at a hapenny a day This sacred pause was one of
the numerous ways in which the establishment kept its finger on the pulse
of fashion and fell into the rhythm of the larger life It had something
to do one day with the particular flare of importance of an arriving
customer a lady whose meals were apparently irregular yet whom she was
destined she afterwards found not to forget The girl was blasee
nothing could belong more as she perfectly knew to the intense
publicity of her profession but she had a whimsical mind and wonderful
nerves she was subject in short to sudden flickers of antipathy and
sympathy red gleams in the grey fitful needs to notice and to care
odd caprices of curiosity She had a friend who had invented a new
career for womenthat of being in and out of peoples houses to look
after the flowers Mrs Jordan had a manner of her own of sounding this
allusion the flowers on her lips were in fantastic places in happy
homes as usual as the coals or the daily papers She took charge of
them at any rate in all the rooms at so much a month and people were
quickly finding out what it was to make over this strange burden of the
pampered to the widow of a clergyman The widow on her side dilating
on the initiations thus opened up to her had been splendid to her young
friend over the way she was made free of the greatest housesthe way
especially when she did the dinnertables set out so often for twenty
she felt that a single step more would transform her whole social
position On its being asked of her then if she circulated only in a
sort of tropical solitude with the upper servants for picturesque
natives and on her having to assent to this glance at her limitations
she had found a reply to the girls invidious question Youve no
imagination my dearthat was because a door more than half open to
the higher life couldnt be called anything but a thin partition Mrs
Jordans imagination quite did away with the thickness

Our young lady had not taken up the charge had dealt with it
goodhumouredly just because she knew so well what to think of it It
was at once one of her most cherished complaints and most secret supports
that people didnt understand her and it was accordingly a matter of
indifference to her that Mrs Jordan shouldnt even though Mrs Jordan
handed down from their early twilight of gentility and also the victim of
reverses was the only member of her circle in whom she recognised an
equal She was perfectly aware that her imaginative life was the life in
which she spent most of her time and she would have been ready had it
been at all worth while to contend that since her outward occupation
didnt kill it it must be strong indeed Combinations of flowers and
greenstuff forsooth What _she_ could handle freely she said to
herself was combinations of men and women The only weakness in her
faculty came from the positive abundance of her contact with the human
herd this was so constant it had so the effect of cheapening her
privilege that there were long stretches in which inspiration
divination and interest quite dropped The great thing was the flashes
the quick revivals absolute accidents all and neither to be counted on
nor to be resisted Some one had only sometimes to put in a penny for a
stamp and the whole thing was upon her She was so absurdly constructed
that these were literally the moments that made upmade up for the long
stiffness of sitting there in the stocks made up for the cunning
hostility of Mr Buckton and the importunate sympathy of the
counterclerk made up for the daily deadly flourishy letter from Mr
Mudge made up even for the most haunting of her worries the rage at
moments of not knowing how her mother did get it

She had surrendered herself moreover of late to a certain expansion of
her consciousness something that seemed perhaps vulgarly accounted for
by the fact that as the blast of the season roared louder and the waves
of fashion tossed their spray further over the counter there were more
impressions to be gathered and reallyfor it came to thatmore life to
be led Definite at any rate it was that by the time May was well
started the kind of company she kept at Cockers had begun to strike her
as a reasona reason she might almost put forward for a policy of
procrastination It sounded silly of course as yet to plead such a
motive especially as the fascination of the place was after all a sort
of torment But she liked her torment it was a torment she should miss
at Chalk Farm She was ingenious and uncandid therefore about leaving
the breadth of London a little longer between herself and that austerity
If she hadnt quite the courage in short to say to Mr Mudge that her
actual chance for a play of mind was worth any week the three shillings
he desired to help her to save she yet saw something happen in the
course of the month that in her heart of hearts at least answered the
subtle question This was connected precisely with the appearance of the
memorable lady




CHAPTER III


She pushed in three bescribbled forms which the girls hand was quick to
appropriate Mr Buckton having so frequent a perverse instinct for
catching first any eye that promised the sort of entertainment with which
she had her peculiar affinity The amusements of captives are full of a
desperate contrivance and one of our young friends hapennyworths had
been the charming tale of Picciola It was of course the law of the
place that they were never to take no notice as Mr Buckton said whom
they served but this also never prevented certainly on the same
gentlemans own part what he was fond of describing as the underhand
game Both her companions for that matter made no secret of the number
of favourites they had among the ladies sweet familiarities in spite of
which she had repeatedly caught each of them in stupidities and mistakes
confusions of identity and lapses of observation that never failed to
remind her how the cleverness of men ends where the cleverness of women
begins Marguerite Regent Street Try on at six All Spanish lace
Pearls The full length That was the first it had no signature
Lady Agnes Orme Hyde Park Place Impossible tonight dining Haddon
Opera tomorrow promised Fritz but could do play Wednesday Will try
Haddon for Savoy and anything in the world you like if you can get
Gussy Sunday Montenero Sit Mason Monday Tuesday Marguerite awful
Cissy That was the second The third the girl noted when she took
it was on a foreign form Everard Hotel Brighton Paris Only
understand and believe 22nd to 26th and certainly 8th and 9th Perhaps
others Come Mary

Mary was very handsome the handsomest woman she felt in a moment she
had ever seenor perhaps it was only Cissy Perhaps it was both for
she had seen stranger things than thatladies wiring to different
persons under different names She had seen all sorts of things and
pieced together all sorts of mysteries There had once been onenot
long beforewho without winking sent off five over five different
signatures Perhaps these represented five different friends who had
asked herall women just as perhaps now Mary and Cissy or one or other
of them were wiring by deputy Sometimes she put in too muchtoo much
of her own sense sometimes she put in too little and in either case
this often came round to her afterwards for she had an extraordinary way
of keeping clues When she noticed she noticed that was what it came
to There were days and days there were weeks sometimes of vacancy
This arose often from Mr Bucktons devilish and successful subterfuges
for keeping her at the sounder whenever it looked as if anything might
arouse the sounder which it was equally his business to mind being the
innermost cell of captivity a cage within the cage fenced oft from the
rest by a frame of ground glass The counterclerk would have played
into her hands but the counterclerk was really reduced to idiocy by the
effect of his passion for her She flattered herself moreover nobly
that with the unpleasant conspicuity of this passion she would never have
consented to be obliged to him The most she would ever do would be
always to shove off on him whenever she could the registration of
letters a job she happened particularly to loathe After the long
stupors at all events there almost always suddenly would come a sharp
taste of something it was in her mouth before she knew it it was in her
mouth now

To Cissy to Mary whichever it was she found her curiosity going out
with a rush a mute effusion that floated back to her like a returning
tide the living colour and splendour of the beautiful head the light of
eyes that seemed to reflect such utterly other things than the mean
things actually before them and above all the high curt consideration
of a manner that even at bad moments was a magnificent habit and of the
very essence of the innumerable thingsher beauty her birth her father
and mother her cousins and all her ancestorsthat its possessor
couldnt have got rid of even had she wished How did our obscure little
public servant know that for the lady of the telegrams this was a bad
moment How did she guess all sorts of impossible things such as
almost on the very spot the presence of drama at a critical stage and
the nature of the tie with the gentleman at the Hotel Brighton More
than ever before it floated to her through the bars of the cage that this
at last was the high reality the bristling truth that she had hitherto
only patched up and eked outone of the creatures in fine in whom all
the conditions for happiness actually met and who in the air they made
bloomed with an unwitting insolence What came home to the girl was the
way the insolence was tempered by something that was equally a part of
the distinguished life the custom of a flowerlike bend to the less
fortunatea dropped fragrance a mere quick breath but which in fact
pervaded and lingered The apparition was very young but certainly
married and our fatigued friend had a sufficient store of mythological
comparison to recognise the port of Juno Marguerite might be awful
but she knew how to dress a goddess

Pearls and Spanish laceshe herself with assurance could see them and
the full length too and also red velvet bows which disposed on the
lace in a particular manner she could have placed them with the turn of
a hand were of course to adorn the front of a black brocade that would
be like a dress in a picture However neither Marguerite nor Lady Agnes
nor Haddon nor Fritz nor Gussy was what the wearer of this garment had
really come in for She had come in for Everardand that was doubtless
not his true name either If our young lady had never taken such jumps
before it was simply that she had never before been so affected She
went all the way Mary and Cissy had been round together in their
single superb person to see himhe must live round the corner they had
found that in consequence of something they had come precisely to make
up for or to have another scene about he had gone offgone off just on
purpose to make them feel it on which they had come together to Cockers
as to the nearest place where they had put in the three forms partly in
order not to put in the one alone The two others in a manner covered
it muffled it passed it off Oh yes she went all the way and this
was a specimen of how she often went She would know the hand again any
time It was as handsome and as everything else as the woman herself
The woman herself had on learning his flight pushed past Everards
servant and into his room she had written her missive at his table and
with his pen All this every inch of it came in the waft that she blew
through and left behind her the influence that as I have said
lingered And among the things the girl was sure of happily was that
she should see her again




CHAPTER IV


She saw her in fact and only ten days later but this time not alone
and that was exactly a part of the luck of it Not unawareas how could
her observation have left her soof the possibilities through which it
could range our young lady had ever since had in her mind a dozen
conflicting theories about Everards type as to which the instant they
came into the place she felt the point settled with a thump that seemed
somehow addressed straight to her heart That organ literally beat
faster at the approach of the gentleman who was this time with Cissy and
who as seen from within the cage became on the spot the happiest of the
happy circumstances with which her mind had invested the friend of Fritz
and Gussy He was a very happy circumstance indeed as with his
cigarette in his lips and his broken familiar talk caught by his
companion he put down the halfdozen telegrams it would take them
together several minutes to dispatch And here it occurred oddly
enough that if shortly before the girls interest in his companion had
sharpened her sense for the messages then transmitted her immediate
vision of himself had the effect while she counted his seventy words of
preventing intelligibility His words were mere numbers they told her
nothing whatever and after he had gone she was in possession of no name
of no address of no meaning of nothing but a vague sweet sound and an
immense impression He had been there but five minutes he had smoked in
her face and busy with his telegrams with the tapping pencil and the
conscious danger the odious betrayal that would come from a mistake she
had had no wandering glances nor roundabout arts to spare Yet she had
taken him in she knew everything she had made up her mind

He had come back from Paris everything was rearranged the pair were
again shoulder to shoulder in their high encounter with life their large
and complicated game The fine soundless pulse of this game was in the
air for our young woman while they remained in the shop While they
remained They remained all day their presence continued and abode with
her was in everything she did till nightfall in the thousands of other
words she counted she transmitted in all the stamps she detached and
the letters she weighed and the change she gave equally unconscious and
unerring in each of these particulars and not as the run on the little
office thickened with the afternoon hours looking up at a single ugly
face in the long sequence nor really hearing the stupid questions that
she patiently and perfectly answered All patience was possible now all
questions were stupid after his all faces were ugly She had been sure
she should see the lady again and even now she should perhaps she
should probably see her often But for him it was totally different
she should never never see him She wanted it too much There was a
kind of wanting that helpedshe had arrived with her rich experience
at that generalisation and there was another kind that was fatal It
was this time the fatal kind it would prevent

Well she saw him the very next day and on this second occasion it was
quite different the sense of every syllable he paid for was fiercely
distinct she indeed felt her progressive pencil dabbing as if with a
quick caress the marks of his own put life into every stroke He was
there a long timehad not brought his forms filled out but worked them
off in a nook on the counter and there were other people as wella
changing pushing cluster with every one to mind at once and endless
right change to make and information to produce But she kept hold of
him throughout she continued for herself in a relation with him as
close as that in which behind the hated ground glass Mr Buckton
luckily continued with the sounder This morning everything changed but
rather to dreariness she had to swallow the rebuff to her theory about
fatal desires which she did without confusion and indeed with absolute
levity yet if it was now flagrant that he did live close at handat
Park Chambersand belonged supremely to the class that wired everything
even their expensive feelings so that as he never wrote his
correspondence cost him weekly pounds and pounds and he might be in and
out five times a day there was all the same involved in the prospect
and by reason of its positive excess of light a perverse melancholy a
gratuitous misery This was at once to give it a place in an order of
feelings on which I shall presently touch

Meanwhile for a month he was very constant Cissy Mary never
reappeared with him he was always either alone or accompanied only by
some gentleman who was lost in the blaze of his glory There was another
sense howeverand indeed there was more than onein which she mostly
found herself counting in the splendid creature with whom she had
originally connected him He addressed this correspondent neither as
Mary nor as Cissy but the girl was sure of whom it was in Eaten Square
that he was perpetually wiring toand all so irreproachablyas Lady
Bradeen Lady Bradeen was Cissy Lady Bradeen was Mary Lady Bradeen was
the friend of Fritz and of Gussy the customer of Marguerite and the
close ally in short as was ideally right only the girl had not yet
found a descriptive term that was of the most magnificent of men
Nothing could equal the frequency and variety of his communications to
her ladyship but their extraordinary their abysmal propriety It was
just the talkso profuse sometimes that she wondered what was left for
their real meetingsof the very happiest people Their real meetings
must have been constant for half of it was appointments and allusions
all swimming in a sea of other allusions still tangled in a complexity
of questions that gave a wondrous image of their life If Lady Bradeen
was Juno it was all certainly Olympian If the girl missing the
answers her ladyships own outpourings vainly reflected that Cockers
should have been one of the bigger offices where telegrams arrived as
well as departed there were yet ways in which on the whole she pressed
the romance closer by reason of the very quantity of imagination it
demanded and consumed The days and hours of this new friend as she
came to account him were at all events unrolled and however much more
she might have known she would still have wished to go beyond In fact
she did go beyond she went quite far enough

But she could none the less even after a month scarce have told if the
gentlemen who came in with him recurred or changed and this in spite of
the fact that they too were always posting and wiring smoking in her
face and signing or not signing The gentlemen who came in with him were
nothing when he was there They turned up alone at other timesthen
only perhaps with a dim richness of reference He himself absent as
well as present was all He was very tall very fair and had in spite
of his thick preoccupations a goodhumour that was exquisite
particularly as it so often had the effect of keeping him on He could
have reached over anybody and anybodyno matter whowould have let
him but he was so extraordinarily kind that he quite pathetically
waited never waggling things at her out of his turn nor saying Here
with horrid sharpness He waited for pottering old ladies for gaping
slaveys for the perpetual Buttonses from Thrupps and the thing in all
this that she would have liked most unspeakably to put to the test was
the possibility of her having for him a personal identity that might in a
particular way appeal There were moments when he actually struck her as
on her side as arranging to help to support to spare her

But such was the singular spirit of our young friend that she could
remind herself with a pang that when people had awfully good
mannerspeople of that classyou couldnt tell These manners were
for everybody and it might be drearily unavailing for any poor
particular body to be overworked and unusual What he did take for
granted was all sorts of facility and his high pleasantness his
relighting of cigarettes while he waited his unconscious bestowal of
opportunities of boons of blessings were all a part of his splendid
security the instinct that told him there was nothing such an existence
as his could ever lose by He was somehow all at once very bright and
very grave very young and immensely complete and whatever he was at any
moment it was always as much as all the rest the mere bloom of his
beatitude He was sometimes Everard as he had been at the Hotel
Brighton and he was sometimes Captain Everard He was sometimes Philip
with his surname and sometimes Philip without it In some directions he
was merely Phil in others he was merely Captain There were relations
in which he was none of these things but a quite different personthe
Count There were several friends for whom he was William There were
several for whom in allusion perhaps to his complexion he was the Pink
Un Once once only by good luck he had coinciding comically quite
miraculously with another person also near to her been Mudge Yes
whatever he was it was a part of his happinesswhatever he was and
probably whatever he wasnt And his happiness was a partit became so
little by littleof something that almost from the first of her being
at Cockers had been deeply with the girl




CHAPTER V


This was neither more nor less than the queer extension of her
experience the double life that in the cage she grew at last to lead
As the weeks went on there she lived more and more into the world of
whiffs and glimpses she found her divinations work faster and stretch
further It was a prodigious view as the pressure heightened a panorama
fed with facts and figures flushed with a torrent of colour and
accompanied with wondrous worldmusic What it mainly came to at this
period was a picture of how London could amuse itself and that with the
running commentary of a witness so exclusively a witness turned for the
most part to a hardening of the heart The nose of this observer was
brushed by the bouquet yet she could never really pluck even a daisy
What could still remain fresh in her daily grind was the immense
disparity the difference and contrast from class to class of every
instant and every motion There were times when all the wires in the
country seemed to start from the little holeandcorner where she plied
for a livelihood and where in the shuffle of feet the flutter of
forms the straying of stamps and the ring of change over the counter
the people she had fallen into the habit of remembering and fitting
together with others and of having her theories and interpretations of
kept up before her their long procession and rotation What twisted the
knife in her vitals was the way the profligate rich scattered about them
in extravagant chatter over their extravagant pleasures and sins an
amount of money that would have held the stricken household of her
frightened childhood her poor pinched mother and tormented father and
lost brother and starved sister together for a lifetime During her
first weeks she had often gasped at the sums people were willing to pay
for the stuff they transmittedthe much loves the awful regrets
the compliments and wonderments and vain vague gestures that cost the
price of a new pair of boots She had had a way then of glancing at the
peoples faces but she had early learnt that if you became a
telegraphist you soon ceased to be astonished Her eye for types
amounted nevertheless to genius and there were those she liked and those
she hated her feeling for the latter of which grew to a positive
possession an instinct of observation and detection There were the
brazen women as she called them of the higher and the lower fashion
whose squanderings and graspings whose struggles and secrets and love
affairs and lies she tracked and stored up against them till she had at
moments in private a triumphant vicious feeling of mastery and ease a
sense of carrying their silly guilty secrets in her pocket her small
retentive brain and thereby knowing so much more about them than they
suspected or would care to think There were those she would have liked
to betray to trip up to bring down with words altered and fatal and
all through a personal hostility provoked by the lightest signs by their
accidents of tone and manner by the particular kind of relation she
always happened instantly to feel

There were impulses of various kinds alternately soft and severe to
which she was constitutionally accessible and which were determined by
the smallest accidents She was rigid in general on the article of
making the public itself affix its stamps and found a special enjoyment
in dealing to that end with some of the ladies who were too grand to
touch them She had thus a play of refinement and subtlety greater she
flattered herself than any of which she could be made the subject and
though most people were too stupid to be conscious of this it brought her
endless small consolations and revenges She recognised quite as much
those of her sex whom she would have liked to help to warn to rescue
to see more of and that alternative as well operated exactly through the
hazard of personal sympathy her vision for silver threads and moonbeams
and her gift for keeping the clues and finding her way in the tangle The
moonbeams and silver threads presented at moments all the vision of what
poor _she_ might have made of happiness Blurred and blank as the whole
thing often inevitably or mercifully became she could still through
crevices and crannies be stupefied especially by what in spite of all
seasoning touched the sorest place in her consciousness the revelation
of the golden shower flying about without a gleam of gold for herself It
remained prodigious to the end the money her fine friends were able to
spend to get still more or even to complain to fine friends of their own
that they were in want The pleasures they proposed were equalled only
by those they declined and they made their appointments often so
expensively that she was left wondering at the nature of the delights to
which the mere approaches were so paved with shillings She quivered on
occasion into the perception of this and that one whom she would on the
chance have just simply liked to _be_ Her conceit her baffled vanity
was possibly monstrous she certainly often threw herself into a defiant
conviction that she would have done the whole thing much better But her
greatest comfort mostly was her comparative vision of the men by whom
I mean the unmistakeable gentlemen for she had no interest in the
spurious or the shabby and no mercy at all for the poor She could have
found a sixpence outside for an appearance of want but her fancy in
some directions so alert had never a throb of response for any sign of
the sordid The men she did track moreover she tracked mainly in one
relation the relation as to which the cage convinced her she believed
more than anything else could have done that it was quite the most
diffused

She found her ladies in short almost always in communication with her
gentlemen and her gentlemen with her ladies and she read into the
immensity of their intercourse stories and meanings without end
Incontestably she grew to think that the men cut the best figure and in
this particular as in many others she arrived at a philosophy of her
own all made up of her private notations and cynicisms It was a
striking part of the business for example that it was much more the
women on the whole who were after the men than the men who were after
the women it was literally visible that the general attitude of the one
sex was that of the object pursued and defensive apologetic and
attenuating while the light of her own nature helped her more or less to
conclude as to the attitude of the other Perhaps she herself a little
even fell into the custom of pursuit in occasionally deviating only for
gentlemen from her high rigour about the stamps She had early in the
day made up her mind in fine that they had the best manners and if
there were none of them she noticed when Captain Everard was there there
were plenty she could place and trace and name at other times plenty
who with their way of being nice to her and of handling as if their
pockets were private tills loose mixed masses of silver and gold were
such pleasant appearances that she could envy them without dislike
_They_ never had to give changethey only had to get it They ranged
through every suggestion every shade of fortune which evidently
included indeed lots of bad luck as well as of good declining even
toward Mr Mudge and his bland firm thrift and ascending in wild
signals and rocketflights almost to within hail of her highest
standard So from month to month she went on with them all through a
thousand ups and downs and a thousand pangs and indifferences What
virtually happened was that in the shuffling herd that passed before her
by far the greater part only passeda proportion but just appreciable
stayed Most of the elements swam straight away lost themselves in the
bottomless common and by so doing really kept the page clear On the
clearness therefore what she did retain stood sharply out she nipped and
caught it turned it over and interwove it




CHAPTER VI


She met Mrs Jordan when she could and learned from her more and more
how the great people under her gentle shake and after going through
everything with the mere shops were waking up to the gain of putting
into the hands of a person of real refinement the question that the shop
people spoke of so vulgarly as that of the floral decorations The
regular dealers in these decorations were all very well but there was a
peculiar magic in the play of taste of a lady who had only to remember
through whatever intervening dusk all her own little tables little
bowls and little jars and little other arrangements and the wonderful
thing she had made of the garden of the vicarage This small domain
which her young friend had never seen bloomed in Mrs Jordans discourse
like a new Eden and she converted the past into a bank of violets by the
tone in which she said Of course you always knew my one passion She
obviously met now at any rate a big contemporary need measured what it
was rapidly becoming for people to feel they could trust her without a
tremor It brought them a peace thatduring the quarter of an hour
before dinner in especialwas worth more to them than mere payment could
express Mere payment none the less was tolerably prompt she engaged
by the month taking over the whole thing and there was an evening on
which in respect to our heroine she at last returned to the charge
Its growing and growing and I see that I must really divide the work
One wants an associateof ones own kind dont you know You know the
look they want it all to haveof having come not from a florist but
from one of themselves Well Im sure _you_ could give itbecause you
_are_ one Then we _should_ win Therefore just come in with me

And leave the PO

Let the PO simply bring you your letters It would bring you lots
youd see orders after a bit by the score It was on this in due
course that the great advantage again came up One seems to live again
with ones own people It had taken some little time after their
having parted company in the tempest of their troubles and then in the
glimmering dawn finally sighted each other again for each to admit that
the other was in her private circle her only equal but the admission
came when it did come with an honest groan and since equality was
named each found much personal profit in exaggerating the others
original grandeur Mrs Jordan was ten years the older but her young
friend was struck with the smaller difference this now made it had
counted otherwise at the time when much more as a friend of her
mothers the bereaved lady without a penny of provision and with
stopgaps like their own all gone had across the sordid landing on
which the opposite doors of the pair of scared miseries opened and to
which they were bewilderedly bolted borrowed coals and umbrellas that
were repaid in potatoes and postagestamps It had been a questionable
help at that time to ladies submerged floundering panting swimming
for their lives that they were ladies but such an advantage could come
up again in proportion as others vanished and it had grown very great by
the time it was the only ghost of one they possessed They had literally
watched it take to itself a portion of the substance of each that had
departed and it became prodigious now when they could talk of it
together when they could look back at it across a desert of accepted
derogation and when above all they could together work up a credulity
about it that neither could otherwise work up Nothing was really so
marked as that they felt the need to cultivate this legend much more
after having found their feet and stayed their stomachs in the ultimate
obscure than they had done in the upper air of mere frequent shocks The
thing they could now oftenest say to each other was that they knew what
they meant and the sentiment with which all round they knew it was
known had wellnigh amounted to a promise not again to fall apart

Mrs Jordan was at present fairly dazzling on the subject of the way
that in the practice of her fairy art as she called it she more than
peeped inshe penetrated There was not a house of the great kindand
it was of course only a question of those real homes of luxuryin which
she was not at the rate such people now had things all over the place
The girl felt before the picture the cold breath of disinheritance as
much as she had ever felt it in the cage she knew moreover how much she
betrayed this for the experience of poverty had begun in her life too
early and her ignorance of the requirements of homes of luxury had
grown with other active knowledge a depth of simplification She had
accordingly at first often found that in these colloquies she could only
pretend she understood Educated as she had rapidly been by her chances
at Cockers there were still strange gaps in her learningshe could
never like Mrs Jordan have found her way about one of the homes
Little by little however she had caught on above all in the light of
what Mrs Jordans redemption had materially made of that lady giving
her though the years and the struggles had naturally not straightened a
feature an almost supereminent air There were women in and out of
Cockers who were quite nice and who yet didnt look well whereas Mrs
Jordan looked well and yet with her extraordinarily protrusive teeth
was by no means quite nice It would seem mystifyingly that it might
really come from all the greatness she could live with It was fine to
hear her talk so often of dinners of twenty and of her doing as she
said exactly as she liked with them She spoke as if for that matter
she invited the company They simply give me the tableall the rest
all the other effects come afterwards




CHAPTER VII


Then you _do_ see them the girl again asked

Mrs Jordan hesitated and indeed the point had been ambiguous before
Do you mean the guests

Her young friend cautious about an undue exposure of innocence was not
quite sure Wellthe people who live there

Lady Ventnor Mrs Bubb Lord Rye Dear yes Why they _like_ one

But does one personally _know_ them our young lady went on since that
was the way to speak I mean socially dont you knowas you know
_me_

Theyre not so nice as you Mrs Jordan charmingly cried But I
_shall_ see more and more of them

Ah this was the old story But how soon

Why almost any day Of course Mrs Jordan honestly added theyre
nearly always out

Then why do they want flowers all over

Oh that doesnt make any difference Mrs Jordan was not philosophic
she was just evidently determined it _shouldnt_ make any Theyre
awfully interested in my ideas and its inevitable they should meet me
over them

Her interlocutress was sturdy enough What do you call your ideas

Mrs Jordans reply was fine If you were to see me some day with a
thousand tulips youd discover

A thousandthe girl gaped at such a revelation of the scale of it
she felt for the instant fairly planted out Well but if in fact they
never do meet you she none the less pessimistically insisted

Never They _often_ doand evidently quite on purpose We have grand
long talks

There was something in our young lady that could still stay her from
asking for a personal description of these apparitions that showed too
starved a state But while she considered she took in afresh the whole
of the clergymans widow Mrs Jordan couldnt help her teeth and her
sleeves were a distinct rise in the world A thousand tulips at a
shilling clearly took one further than a thousand words at a penny and
the betrothed of Mr Mudge in whom the sense of the race for life was
always acute found herself wondering with a twinge of her easy
jealousy if it mightnt after all then for _her_ also be betterbetter
than where she wasto follow some such scent Where she was was where
Mr Bucktons elbow could freely enter her right side and the counter
clerks breathinghe had something the matter with his nosepervade her
left ear It was something to fill an office under Government and she
knew but too well there were places commoner still than Cockers but it
needed no great range of taste to bring home to her the picture of
servitude and promiscuity she couldnt but offer to the eye of
comparative freedom She was so boxed up with her young men and
anything like a margin so absent that it needed more art than she should
ever possess to pretend in the least to compass with any one in the
nature of an acquaintancesay with Mrs Jordan herself flying in as it
might happen to wire sympathetically to Mrs Bubban approach to a
relation of elegant privacy She remembered the day when Mrs Jordan
_had_ in fact by the greatest chance come in with fiftythree words
for Lord Rye and a fivepound note to change This had been the dramatic
manner of their reuniontheir mutual recognition was so great an event
The girl could at first only see her from the waist up besides making
but little of her long telegram to his lordship It was a strange
whirligig that had converted the clergymans widow into such a specimen
of the class that went beyond the sixpence

Nothing of the occasion all the more had ever become dim least of all
the way that as her recovered friend looked up from counting Mrs
Jordan had just blown in explanation through her teeth and through the
bars of the cage I _do_ flowers you know Our young woman had
always with her little finger crooked out a pretty movement for
counting and she had not forgotten the small secret advantage a
sharpness of triumph it might even have been called that fell upon her
at this moment and avenged her for the incoherence of the message an
unintelligible enumeration of numbers colours days hours The
correspondence of people she didnt know was one thing but the
correspondence of people she did had an aspect of its own for her even
when she couldnt understand it The speech in which Mrs Jordan had
defined a position and announced a profession was like a tinkle of
bluebells but for herself her one idea about flowers was that people had
them at funerals and her present sole gleam of light was that lords
probably had them most When she watched a minute later through the
cage the swing of her visitors departing petticoats she saw the sight
from the waist down and when the counterclerk after a mere male
glance remarked with an intention unmistakeably low Handsome woman
she had for him the finest of her chills Shes the widow of a bishop
She always felt with the counterclerk that it was impossible
sufficiently to put it on for what she wished to express to him was the
maximum of her contempt and that element in her nature was confusedly
stored A bishop was putting it on but the counterclerks approaches
were vile The night after this when in the fulness of time Mrs
Jordan mentioned the grand long talks the girl at last brought out
Should _I_ see themI mean if I _were_ to give up everything for you

Mrs Jordan at this became most arch Id send you to all the
bachelors

Our young lady could be reminded by such a remark that she usually struck
her friend as pretty Do _they_ have their flowers

Oceans And theyre the most particular Oh it was a wonderful world
You should see Lord Ryes

His flowers

Yes and his letters He writes me pages on pageswith the most
adorable little drawings and plans You should see his diagrams




CHAPTER VIII


The girl had in course of time every opportunity to inspect these
documents and they a little disappointed her but in the mean while
there had been more talk and it had led to her saying as if her
friends guarantee of a life of elegance were not quite definite Well
I see every one at _my_ place

Every one

Lots of swells They flock They live you know all round and the
place is filled with all the smart people all the fast people those
whose names are in the papersmamma has still The Morning Postand who
come up for the season

Mrs Jordan took this in with complete intelligence Yes and I dare
say its some of your people that _I_ do

Her companion assented but discriminated I doubt if you do them as
much as I Their affairs their appointments and arrangements their
little games and secrets and vicesthose things all pass before me

This was a picture that could make a clergymans widow not imperceptibly
gasp it was in intention moreover something of a retort to the thousand
tulips Their vices Have they got vices

Our young critic even more overtly stared then with a touch of contempt
in her amusement Havent you found _that_ out The homes of luxury
then hadnt so much to give _I_ find out everything

Mrs Jordan at bottom a very meek person was visibly struck I see
You do have them

Oh I dont care Much good it does me

Mrs Jordan after an instant recovered her superiority Noit doesnt
lead to much Her own initiations so clearly did Stillafter all
and she was not jealous There must be a charm

In seeing them At this the girl suddenly let herself go I hate
them Theres that charm

Mrs Jordan gaped again The _real_ smarts

Is that what you call Mrs Bubb Yesit comes to me Ive had Mrs
Bubb I dont think she has been in herself but there are things her
maid has brought Well my dearand the young person from Cockers
recalling these things and summing them up seemed suddenly to have much
to say She didnt say it however she checked it she only brought
out Her maid whos horrid_she_ must have her Then she went on
with indifference Theyre _too_ real Theyre selfish brutes

Mrs Jordan turning it over adopted at last the plan of treating it
with a smile She wished to be liberal Well of course they do lay
it out

They bore me to death her companion pursued with slightly more
temperance

But this was going too far Ah thats because youve no sympathy

The girl gave an ironic laugh only retorting that nobody could have any
who had to count all day all the words in the dictionary a contention
Mrs Jordan quite granted the more that she shuddered at the notion of
ever failing of the very gift to which she owed the voguethe rage she
might call itthat had caught her up Without sympathyor without
imagination for it came back again to thathow should she get for big
dinners down the middle and toward the far corners at all It wasnt
the combinations which were easily managed the strain was over the
ineffable simplicities those that the bachelors above all and Lord Rye
perhaps most of any threw offjust blew off like cigarettepuffssuch
sketches of The betrothed of Mr Mudge at all events accepted the
explanation which had the effect as almost any turn of their talk was
now apt to have of bringing her round to the terrific question of that
gentleman She was tormented with the desire to get out of Mrs Jordan
on this subject what she was sure was at the back of Mrs Jordans head
and to get it out of her queerly enough if only to vent a certain
irritation at it She knew that what her friend would already have
risked if she hadnt been timid and tortuous was Give him upyes give
him up youll see that with your sure chances youll be able to do much
better

Our young woman had a sense that if that view could only be put before
her with a particular sniff for poor Mr Mudge she should hate it as much
as she morally ought She was conscious of not as yet hating it quite
so much as that But she saw that Mrs Jordan was conscious of something
too and that there was a degree of confidence she was waiting little by
little to arrive at The day came when the girl caught a glimpse of what
was still wanting to make her friend feel strong which was nothing less
than the prospect of being able to announce the climax of sundry private
dreams The associate of the aristocracy had personal
calculationsmatter for brooding and dreaming even for peeping out not
quite hopelessly from behind the windowcurtains of lonely lodgings If
she did the flowers for the bachelors in short didnt she expect that
to have consequences very different from such an outlook at Cockers as
she had pronounced wholly desperate There seemed in very truth
something auspicious in the mixture of bachelors and flowers though
when looked hard in the eye Mrs Jordan was not quite prepared to say
she had expected a positive proposal from Lord Rye to pop out of it Our
young woman arrived at last none the less at a definite vision of what
was in her mind This was a vivid foreknowledge that the betrothed of
Mr Mudge would unless conciliated in advance by a successful rescue
almost hate her on the day she should break a particular piece of news
How could that unfortunate otherwise endure to hear of what under the
protection of Lady Ventnor was after all so possible




CHAPTER IX


Meanwhile since irritation sometimes relieved her the betrothed of Mr
Mudge found herself indebted to that admirer for amounts of it perfectly
proportioned to her fidelity She always walked with him on Sundays
usually in the Regents Park and quite often once or twice a month he
took her in the Strand or thereabouts to see a piece that was having a
run The productions he always preferred were the really good
onesShakespeare Thompson or some funny American thing which as it
also happened that she hated vulgar plays gave him ground for what was
almost the fondest of his approaches the theory that their tastes were
blissfully just the same He was for ever reminding her of that
rejoicing over it and being affectionate and wise about it There were
times when she wondered how in the world she could put up with him how
she could put up with any man so smugly unconscious of the immensity of
her difference It was just for this difference that if she was to be
liked at all she wanted to be liked and if that was not the source of
Mr Mudges admiration she asked herself what on earth _could_ be She
was not different only at one point she was different all round unless
perhaps indeed in being practically human which her mind just barely
recognised that he also was She would have made tremendous concessions
in other quarters there was no limit for instance to those she would
have made to Captain Everard but what I have named was the most she was
prepared to do for Mr Mudge It was because _he_ was different that in
the oddest way she liked as well as deplored him which was after all a
proof that the disparity should they frankly recognise it wouldnt
necessarily be fatal She felt that oleaginoustoo oleaginousas he
was he was somehow comparatively primitive she had once during the
portion of his time at Cockers that had overlapped her own seen him
collar a drunken soldier a big violent man who having come in with a
mate to get a postalorder cashed had made a grab at the money before
his friend could reach it and had so determined among the hams and
cheeses and the lodgers from Thrupps immediate and alarming reprisals
a scene of scandal and consternation Mr Buckton and the counterclerk
had crouched within the cage but Mr Mudge had with a very quiet but
very quick step round the counter an air of masterful authority she
shouldnt soon forget triumphantly interposed in the scrimmage parted
the combatants and shaken the delinquent in his skin She had been proud
of him at that moment and had felt that if their affair had not already
been settled the neatness of his execution would have left her without
resistance

Their affair had been settled by other things by the evident sincerity
of his passion and by the sense that his high white apron resembled a
front of many floors It had gone a great way with her that he would
build up a business to his chin which he carried quite in the air This
could only be a question of time he would have all Piccadilly in the pen
behind his ear That was a merit in itself for a girl who had known what
she had known There were hours at which she even found him
goodlooking though frankly there could be no crown for her effort to
imagine on the part of the tailor or the barber some such treatment of
his appearance as would make him resemble even remotely a man of the
world His very beauty was the beauty of a grocer and the finest future
would offer it none too much room consistently to develop She had
engaged herself in short to the perfection of a type and almost anything
square and smooth and whole had its weight for a person still conscious
herself of being a mere bruised fragment of wreckage But it contributed
hugely at present to carry on the two parallel lines of her experience in
the cage and her experience out of it After keeping quiet for some time
about this opposition she suddenlyone Sunday afternoon on a penny chair
in the Regents Parkbroke for him capriciously bewilderingly into
an intimation of what it came to He had naturally pressed more and more
on the point of her again placing herself where he could see her hourly
and for her to recognise that she had as yet given him no sane reason for
delay he had small need to describe himself as unable to make out what
she was up to As if with her absurd bad reasons she could have begun
to tell him Sometimes she thought it would be amusing to let him have
them full in the face for she felt she should die of him unless she once
in a while stupefied him and sometimes she thought it would be
disgusting and perhaps even fatal She liked him however to think her
silly for that gave her the margin which at the best she would always
require and the only difficulty about this was that he hadnt enough
imagination to oblige her It produced none the less something of the
desired effectto leave him simply wondering why over the matter of
their reunion she didnt yield to his arguments Then at last simply
as if by accident and out of mere boredom on a day that was rather flat
she preposterously produced her own Well wait a bit Where I am I
still see things And she talked to him even worse if possible than
she had talked to Jordan

Little by little to her own stupefaction she caught that he was trying
to take it as she meant it and that he was neither astonished nor angry
Oh the British tradesmanthis gave her an idea of his resources Mr
Mudge would be angry only with a person who like the drunken soldier in
the shop should have an unfavourable effect on business He seemed
positively to enter for the time and without the faintest flash of irony
or ripple of laughter into the whimsical grounds of her enjoyment of
Cockers custom and instantly to be casting up whatever it might as
Mrs Jordan had said lead to What he had in mind was not of course
what Mrs Jordan had had it was obviously not a source of speculation
with him that his sweetheart might pick up a husband She could see
perfectly that this was not for a moment even what he supposed she
herself dreamed of What she had done was simply to give his sensibility
another push into the dim vast of trade In that direction it was all
alert and she had whisked before it the mild fragrance of a connexion
That was the most he could see in any account of her keeping in on
whatever roundabout lines with the gentry and when getting to the
bottom of this she quickly proceeded to show him the kind of eye she
turned on such people and to give him a sketch of what that eye
discovered she reduced him to the particular prostration in which he
could still be amusing to her




CHAPTER X


Theyre the most awful wretches I assure youthe lot all about there

Then why do you want to stay among them

My dear man just because they _are_ It makes me hate them so

Hate them I thought you liked them

Dont be stupid What I like is just to loathe them You wouldnt
believe what passes before my eyes

Then why have you never told me You didnt mention anything before I
left

Oh I hadnt got round to it then Its the sort of thing you dont
believe at first you have to look round you a bit and then you
understand You work into it more and more Besides the girl went on
this is the time of the year when the worst lot come up Theyre simply
packed together in those smart streets Talk of the numbers of the poor
What _I_ can vouch for is the numbers of the rich There are new ones
every day and they seem to get richer and richer Oh they do come up
she cried imitating for her private recreationshe was sure it wouldnt
reach Mr Mudgethe low intonation of the counterclerk

And where do they come from her companion candidly enquired

She had to think a moment then she found something From the spring
meetings They bet tremendously

Well they bet enough at Chalk Farm if thats all

It _isnt_ all It isnt a millionth part she replied with some
sharpness Its immense funshe _had_ to tantalise him Then as she
had heard Mrs Jordan say and as the ladies at Cockers even sometimes
wired Its quite too dreadful She could fully feel how it was Mr
Mudges propriety which was extremehe had a horror of coarseness and
attended a Wesleyan chapelthat prevented his asking for details But
she gave him some of the more innocuous in spite of himself especially
putting before him how at Simpkins and Ladles they all made the money
fly That was indeed what he liked to hear the connexion was not
direct but one was somehow more in the right place where the money was
flying than where it was simply and meagrely nesting The air felt that
stir he had to acknowledge much less at Chalk Farm than in the district
in which his beloved so oddly enjoyed her footing She gave him she
could see a restless sense that these might be familiarities not to be
sacrificed germs possibilities faint foreshowingsheaven knew whatof
the initiation it would prove profitable to have arrived at when in the
fulness of time he should have his own shop in some such paradise What
really touched himthat was discerniblewas that she could feed him
with so much mere vividness of reminder keep before him as by the play
of a fan the very wind of the swift banknotes and the charm of the
existence of a class that Providence had raised up to be the blessing of
grocers He liked to think that the class was there that it was always
there and that she contributed in her slight but appreciable degree to
keep it up to the mark He couldnt have formulated his theory of the
matter but the exuberance of the aristocracy was the advantage of trade
and everything was knit together in a richness of pattern that it was
good to follow with ones fingertips It was a comfort to him to be
thus assured that there were no symptoms of a drop What did the
sounder as she called it nimbly worked do but keep the ball going

What it came to therefore for Mr Mudge was that all enjoyments were as
might be said interrelated and that the more people had the more they
wanted to have The more flirtations as he might roughly express it
the more cheese and pickles He had even in his own small way been dimly
struck with the linked sweetness connecting the tender passion with cheap
champagne or perhaps the other way round What he would have liked to
say had he been able to work out his thought to the end was I see I
see Lash them up then lead them on keep them going some of it cant
help some time coming _our_ way Yet he was troubled by the suspicion
of subtleties on his companions part that spoiled the straight view He
couldnt understand peoples hating what they liked or liking what they
hated above all it hurt him somewherefor he had his private
delicaciesto see anything _but_ money made out of his betters To be
too enquiring or in any other way too free at the expense of the gentry
was vaguely wrong the only thing that was distinctly right was to be
prosperous at any price Wasnt it just because they were up there aloft
that they were lucrative He concluded at any rate by saying to his
young friend If its improper for you to remain at Cockers then that
falls in exactly with the other reasons Ive put before you for your
removal

Improperher smile became a prolonged boldness My dear boy
theres no one like you

I dare say he laughed but that doesnt help the question

Well she returned I cant give up my friends Im making even more
than Mrs Jordan

Mr Mudge considered How much is _she_ making

Oh you dear donkeyand regardless of all the Regents Park she
patted his cheek This was the sort of moment at which she was
absolutely tempted to tell him that she liked to be near Park Chambers
There was a fascination in the idea of seeing if on a mention of Captain
Everard he wouldnt do what she thought he might wouldnt weigh against
the obvious objection the still more obvious advantage The advantage of
course could only strike him at the best as rather fantastic but it was
always to the good to keep hold when you _had_ hold and such an attitude
would also after all involve a high tribute to her fidelity Of one
thing she absolutely never doubted Mr Mudge believed in her with a
belief She believed in herself too for that matter if there was a
thing in the world no one could charge her with it was being the kind of
low barmaid person who rinsed tumblers and bandied slang But she
forbore as yet to speak she had not spoken even to Mrs Jordan and the
hush that on her lips surrounded the Captains name maintained itself as
a kind of symbol of the success that up to this time had attended
something or othershe couldnt have said whatthat she humoured
herself with calling without words her relation with him




CHAPTER XI


She would have admitted indeed that it consisted of little more than the
fact that his absences however frequent and however long always ended
with his turning up again It was nobodys business in the world but her
own if that fact continued to be enough for her It was of course not
enough just in itself what it had taken on to make it so was the
extraordinary possession of the elements of his life that memory and
attention had at last given her There came a day when this possession
on the girls part actually seemed to enjoy between them while their
eyes met a tacit recognition that was half a joke and half a deep
solemnity He bade her good morning always now he often quite raised
his hat to her He passed a remark when there was time or room and once
she went so far as to say to him that she hadnt seen him for ages
Ages was the word she consciously and carefully though a trifle
tremulously used ages was exactly what she meant To this he replied
in terms doubtless less anxiously selected but perhaps on that account
not the less remarkable Oh yes hasnt it been awfully wet That was
a specimen of their give and take it fed her fancy that no form of
intercourse so transcendent and distilled had ever been established on
earth Everything so far as they chose to consider it so might mean
almost anything The want of margin in the cage when he peeped through
the bars wholly ceased to be appreciable It was a drawback only in
superficial commerce With Captain Everard she had simply the margin of
the universe It may be imagined therefore how their unuttered reference
to all she knew about him could in this immensity play at its ease Every
time he handed in a telegram it was an addition to her knowledge what
did his constant smile mean to mark if it didnt mean to mark that He
never came into the place without saying to her in this manner Oh yes
you have me by this time so completely at your mercy that it doesnt in
the least matter what I give you now Youve become a comfort I assure
you

She had only two torments the greatest of which was that she couldnt
not even once or twice touch with him on some individual fact She
would have given anything to have been able to allude to one of his
friends by name to one of his engagements by date to one of his
difficulties by the solution She would have given almost as much for
just the right chanceit would have to be tremendously rightto show
him in some sharp sweet way that she had perfectly penetrated the
greatest of these last and now lived with it in a kind of heroism of
sympathy He was in love with a woman to whom and to any view of whom
a ladytelegraphist and especially one who passed a life among hams and
cheeses was as the sand on the floor and what her dreams desired was
the possibility of its somehow coming to him that her own interest in him
could take a pure and noble account of such an infatuation and even of
such an impropriety As yet however she could only rub along with the
hope that an accident sooner or later might give her a lift toward
popping out with something that would surprise and perhaps even some
fine day assist him What could people mean moreovercheaply sarcastic
peopleby not feeling all that could be got out of the weather _She_
felt it all and seemed literally to feel it most when she went quite
wrong speaking of the stuffy days as cold of the cold ones as stuffy
and betraying how little she knew in her cage of whether it was foul or
fair It was for that matter always stuffy at Cockers and she finally
settled down to the safe proposition that the outside element was
changeable Anything seemed true that made him so radiantly assent

This indeed is a small specimen of her cultivation of insidious ways of
making things easy for himways to which of course she couldnt be at
all sure he did real justice Real justice was not of this world she
had had too often to come back to that yet strangely happiness was
and her traps had to be set for it in a manner to keep them unperceived
by Mr Buckton and the counterclerk The most she could hope for apart
from the question which constantly flickered up and died down of the
divine chance of his consciously liking her would be that without
analysing it he should arrive at a vague sense that Cockers waswell
attractive easier smoother sociably brighter slightly more
picturesque in short more propitious in general to his little affairs
than any other establishment just thereabouts She was quite aware that
they couldnt be in so huddled a hole particularly quick but she found
her account in the slownessshe certainly could bear it if _he_ could
The great pang was that just thereabouts postoffices were so awfully
thick She was always seeing him in imagination in other places and with
other girls But she would defy any other girl to follow him as she
followed And though they werent for so many reasons quick at
Cockers she could hurry for him when through an intimation light as
air she gathered that he was pressed

When hurry was better still impossible it was because of the
pleasantest thing of all the particular element of their contactshe
would have called it their friendshipthat consisted of an almost
humorous treatment of the look of some of his words They would never
perhaps have grown half so intimate if he had not by the blessing of
heaven formed some of his letters with a queerness It was positive
that the queerness could scarce have been greater if he had practised it
for the very purpose of bringing their heads together over it as far as
was possible to heads on different sides of a wire fence It had taken
her truly but once or twice to master these tricks but at the cost of
striking him perhaps as stupid she could still challenge them when
circumstances favoured The great circumstance that favoured was that
she sometimes actually believed he knew she only feigned perplexity If
he knew it therefore he tolerated it if he tolerated it he came back
and if he came back he liked her This was her seventh heaven and she
didnt ask much of his likingshe only asked of it to reach the point of
his not going away because of her own He had at times to be away for
weeks he had to lead lets life he had to travelthere were places to
which he was constantly wiring for rooms all this she granted him
forgave him in fact in the long run literally blessed and thanked him
for If he had to lead his life that precisely fostered his leading it
so much by telegraph therefore the benediction was to come in when he
could That was all she askedthat he shouldnt wholly deprive her

Sometimes she almost felt that he couldnt have deprived her even had he
been minded by reason of the web of revelation that was woven between
them She quite thrilled herself with thinking what with such a lot of
material a bad girl would do It would be a scene better than many in
her hapenny novels this going to him in the dusk of evening at Park
Chambers and letting him at last have it I know too much about a
certain person now not to put it to youexcuse my being so luridthat
its quite worth your while to buy me off Come therefore buy me
There was a point indeed at which such flights had to drop againthe
point of an unreadiness to name when it came to that the purchasing
medium It wouldnt certainly be anything so gross as money and the
matter accordingly remained rather vague all the more that _she_ was not
a bad girl It wasnt for any such reason as might have aggravated a
mere minx that she often hoped he would again bring Cissy The
difficulty of this however was constantly present to her for the kind
of communion to which Cockers so richly ministered rested on the fact
that Cissy and he were so often in different places She knew by this
time all the placesSuchbury Monkhouse Whiteroy Finchesand even how
the parties on these occasions were composed but her subtlety found ways
to make her knowledge fairly protect and promote their keeping as she
had heard Mrs Jordan say in touch So when he actually sometimes
smiled as if he really felt the awkwardness of giving her again one of
the same old addresses all her being went out in the desirewhich her
face must have expressedthat he should recognise her forbearance to
criticise as one of the finest tenderest sacrifices a woman had ever made
for love




CHAPTER XII


She was occasionally worried however this might be by the impression
that these sacrifices great as they were were nothing to those that his
own passion had imposed if indeed it was not rather the passion of his
confederate which had caught him up and was whirling him round like a
great steamwheel He was at any rate in the strong grip of a dizzy
splendid fate the wild wind of his life blew him straight before it
Didnt she catch in his face at times even through his smile and his
happy habit the gleam of that pale glare with which a bewildered victim
appeals as he passes to some pair of pitying eyes He perhaps didnt
even himself know how scared he was but _she_ knew They were in
danger they were in danger Captain Everard and Lady Bradeen it beat
every novel in the shop She thought of Mr Mudge and his safe
sentiment she thought of herself and blushed even more for her tepid
response to it It was a comfort to her at such moments to feel that in
another relationa relation supplying that affinity with her nature that
Mr Mudge deluded creature would never supplyshe should have been no
more tepid than her ladyship Her deepest soundings were on two or three
occasions of finding herself almost sure that if she dared her
ladyships lover would have gathered relief from speaking to her She
literally fancied once or twice that projected as he was toward his
doom her own eyes struck him while the air roared in his ears as the
one pitying pair in the crowd But how could he speak to her while she
sat sandwiched there between the counterclerk and the sounder

She had long ago in her comings and goings made acquaintance with Park
Chambers and reflected as she looked up at their luxurious front that
they of course would supply the ideal setting for the ideal speech There
was not an object in London that before the season was over was more
stamped upon her brain She went roundabout to pass it for it was not
on the short way she passed on the opposite side of the street and
always looked up though it had taken her a long time to be sure of the
particular set of windows She had made that out finally by an act of
audacity that at the time had almost stopped her heartbeats and that in
retrospect greatly quickened her blushes One evening she had lingered
late and watchedwatched for some moment when the porter who was in
uniform and often on the steps had gone in with a visitor Then she
followed boldly on the calculation that he would have taken the visitor
up and that the hall would be free The hall _was_ free and the
electric light played over the gilded and lettered board that showed the
names and numbers of the occupants of the different floors What she
wanted looked straight at herCaptain Everard was on the third It was
as if in the immense intimacy of this they were for the instant and
the first time face to face outside the cage Alas they were face to
face but a second or two she was whirled out on the wings of a panic
fear that he might just then be entering or issuing This fear was
indeed in her shameless deflexions never very far from her and was
mixed in the oddest way with depressions and disappointments It was
dreadful as she trembled by to run the risk of looking to him as if she
basely hung about and yet it was dreadful to be obliged to pass only at
such moments as put an encounter out of the question

At the horrible hour of her first coming to Cockers he was alwaysit
was to be hopedsnug in bed and at the hour of her final departure he
was of courseshe had such things all on her fingersendsdressing for
dinner We may let it pass that if she couldnt bring herself to hover
till he was dressed this was simply because such a process for such a
person could only be terribly prolonged When she went in the middle of
the day to her own dinner she had too little time to do anything but go
straight though it must be added that for a real certainty she would
joyously have omitted the repast She had made up her mind as to there
being on the whole no decent pretext to justify her flitting casually
past at three oclock in the morning That was the hour at which if the
hapenny novels were not all wrong he probably came home for the night
She was therefore reduced to the vainest figuration of the miraculous
meeting toward which a hundred impossibilities would have to conspire
But if nothing was more impossible than the fact nothing was more
intense than the vision What may not we can only moralise take place
in the quickened muffled perception of a young person with an ardent
soul All our humble friends native distinction her refinement of
personal grain of heredity of pride took refuge in this small
throbbing spot for when she was most conscious of the objection of her
vanity and the pitifulness of her little flutters and manoeuvres then
the consolation and the redemption were most sure to glow before her in
some just discernible sign He did like her




CHAPTER XIII


He never brought Cissy back but Cissy came one day without him as fresh
as before from the hands of Marguerite or only at the seasons end a
trifle less fresh She was however distinctly less serene She had
brought nothing with her and looked about with impatience for the forms
and the place to write The latter convenience at Cockers was obscure
and barely adequate and her clear voice had the light note of disgust
which her lovers never showed as she responded with a There of
surprise to the gesture made by the counterclerk in answer to her sharp
question Our young friend was busy with half a dozen people but she
had dispatched them in her most businesslike manner by the time her
ladyship flung through the bars this light of reappearance Then the
directness with which the girl managed to receive the accompanying
missive was the result of the concentration that had caused her to make
the stamps fly during the few minutes occupied by the production of it
This concentration in turn may be described as the effect of the
apprehension of imminent relief It was nineteen days counted and
checked off since she had seen the object of her homage and as had he
been in London she should with his habits have been sure to see him
often she was now about to learn what other spot his presence might just
then happen to sanctify For she thought of them the other spots as
ecstatically conscious of it expressively happy in it

But gracious how handsome was her ladyship and what an added price it
gave him that the air of intimacy he threw out should have flowed
originally from such a source The girl looked straight through the cage
at the eyes and lips that must so often have been so near as ownlooked
at them with a strange passion that for an instant had the result of
filling out some of the gaps supplying the missing answers in his
correspondence Then as she made out that the features she thus scanned
and associated were totally unaware of it that they glowed only with the
colour of quite other and not at all guessable thoughts this directly
added to their splendour gave the girl the sharpest impression she had
yet received of the uplifted the unattainable plains of heaven and yet
at the same time caused her to thrill with a sense of the high company
she did somehow keep She was with the absent through her ladyship and
with her ladyship through the absent The only pangbut it didnt
matterwas the proof in the admirable face in the sightless
preoccupation of its possessor that the latter hadnt a notion of her
Her folly had gone to the point of half believing that the other party to
the affair must sometimes mention in Eaton Square the extraordinary
little person at the place from which he so often wired Yet the
perception of her visitors blankness actually helped this extraordinary
little person the next instant to take refuge in a reflexion that could
be as proud as it liked How little she knows how little she knows
the girl cried to herself for what did that show after all but that
Captain Everards telegraphic confidant was Captain Everards charming
secret Our young friends perusal of her ladyships telegram was
literally prolonged by a momentary daze what swam between her and the
words making her see them as through rippled shallow sunshot water was
the great the perpetual flood of How much _I_ knowhow much _I_ know
This produced a delay in her catching that on the face these words
didnt give her what she wanted though she was prompt enough with her
remembrance that her grasp was half the time just of what was _not_ on
the face Miss Dolman Parade Lodge Parade Terrace Dover Let him
instantly know right one Hotel de France Ostend Make it seven nine
four nine six one Wire me alternative Burfields

The girl slowly counted Then he was at Ostend This hooked on with so
sharp a click that not to feel she was as quickly letting it all slip
from her she had absolutely to hold it a minute longer and to do
something to that end Thus it was that she did on this occasion what
she never didthrew off a Reply paid that sounded officious but that
she partly made up for by deliberately affixing the stamps and by waiting
till she had done so to give change She had for so much coolness the
strength that she considered she knew all about Miss Dolman

Yespaid She saw all sorts of things in this reply even to a small
suppressed start of surprise at so correct an assumption even to an
attempt the next minute at a fresh air of detachment How much with
the answer The calculation was not abstruse but our intense observer
required a moment more to make it and this gave her ladyship time for a
second thought Oh just wait The white begemmed hand bared to write
rose in sudden nervousness to the side of the wonderful face which with
eyes of anxiety for the paper on the counter she brought closer to the
bars of the cage I think I must alter a word On this she recovered
her telegram and looked over it again but she had a new an obvious
trouble and studied it without deciding and with much of the effect of
making our young woman watch her

This personage meanwhile at the sight of her expression had decided on
the spot If she had always been sure they were in danger her ladyships
expression was the best possible sign of it There was a word wrong but
she had lost the right one and much clearly depended on her finding it
again The girl therefore sufficiently estimating the affluence of
customers and the distraction of Mr Buckton and the counterclerk took
the jump and gave it Isnt it Coopers

It was as if she had bodily leapedcleared the top of the cage and
alighted on her interlocutress Coopersthe stare was heightened by
a blush Yes she had made Juno blush

This was all the greater reason for going on I mean instead of
Burfields

Our young friend fairly pitied her she had made her in an instant so
helpless and yet not a bit haughty nor outraged She was only mystified
and scared Oh you know

Yes I know Our young friend smiled meeting the others eyes and
having made Juno blush proceeded to patronise her _Ill_ do itshe
put out a competent hand Her ladyship only submitted confused and
bewildered all presence of mind quite gone and the next moment the
telegram was in the cage again and its author out of the shop Then
quickly boldly under all the eyes that might have witnessed her
tampering the extraordinary little person at Cockers made the proper
change People were really too giddy and if they _were_ in a certain
case to be caught it shouldnt be the fault of her own grand memory
Hadnt it been settled weeks beforefor Miss Dolman it was always to be
Coopers




CHAPTER XIV


But the summer holidays brought a marked difference they were holidays
for almost every one but the animals in the cage The August days were
flat and dry and with so little to feed it she was conscious of the
ebb of her interest in the secrets of the refined She was in a position
to follow the refined to the extent of knowingthey had made so many of
their arrangements with her aidexactly where they were yet she felt
quite as if the panorama had ceased unrolling and the band stopped
playing A stray member of the latter occasionally turned up but the
communications that passed before her bore now largely on rooms at
hotels prices of furnished houses hours of trains dates of sailings
and arrangements for being met she found them for the most part
prosaic and coarse The only thing was that they brought into her stuffy
corner as straight a whiff of Alpine meadows and Scotch moors as she
might hope ever to inhale there were moreover in especial fat hot dull
ladies who had out with her to exasperation the terms for seaside
lodgings which struck her as huge and the matter of the number of beds
required which was not less portentous this in reference to places of
which the namesEastbourne Folkestone Cromer Scarborough
Whitbytormented her with something of the sound of the plash of water
that haunts the traveller in the desert She had not been out of London
for a dozen years and the only thing to give a taste to the present dead
weeks was the spice of a chronic resentment The sparse customers the
people she did see were the people who were just offoff on the decks
of fluttered yachts off to the uttermost point of rocky headlands where
the very breeze was then playing for the want of which she said to
herself that she sickened

There was accordingly a sense in which at such a period the great
differences of the human condition could press upon her more than ever a
circumstance drawing fresh force in truth from the very fact of the
chance that at last for a change did squarely meet herthe chance to
be off for a bit almost as far as anybody They took their turns in
the cage as they took them both in the shop and at Chalk Farm she had
known these two months that time was to be allowed in Septemberno less
than eleven daysfor her personal private holiday Much of her recent
intercourse with Mr Mudge had consisted of the hopes and fears
expressed mainly by himself involved in the question of their getting
the same datesa question that in proportion as the delight seemed
assured spread into a sea of speculation over the choice of where and
how All through July on the Sunday evenings and at such other odd
times as he could seize he had flooded their talk with wild waves of
calculation It was practically settled that with her mother somewhere
on the south coast a phrase of which she liked the sound they should
put in their allowance together but she already felt the prospect quite
weary and worn with the way he went round and round on it It had become
his sole topic the theme alike of his most solemn prudences and most
placid jests to which every opening led for return and revision and in
which every little flower of a foretaste was pulled up as soon as
planted He had announced at the earliest daycharacterising the whole
business from that moment as their plans under which name he handled
it as a Syndicate handles a Chinese or other Loanhe had promptly
declared that the question must be thoroughly studied and he produced
on the whole subject from day to day an amount of information that
excited her wonder and even not a little as she frankly let him know
her disdain When she thought of the danger in which another pair of
lovers rapturously lived she enquired of him anew why he could leave
nothing to chance Then she got for answer that this profundity was just
his pride and he pitted Ramsgate against Bournemouth and even Boulogne
against Jerseyfor he had great ideaswith all the mastery of detail
that was some day professionally to carry him afar

The longer the time since she had seen Captain Everard the more she was
booked as she called it to pass Park Chambers and this was the sole
amusement that in the lingering August days and the twilights sadly drawn
out it was left her to cultivate She had long since learned to know it
for a feeble one though its feebleness was perhaps scarce the reason for
her saying to herself each evening as her time for departure approached
No nonot tonight She never failed of that silent remark any more
than she failed of feeling in some deeper place than she had even yet
fully sounded that ones remarks were as weak as straws and that
however one might indulge in them at eight oclock ones fate infallibly
declared itself in absolute indifference to them at about eightfifteen
Remarks were remarks and very well for that but fate was fate and this
young ladys was to pass Park Chambers every night in the working week
Out of the immensity of her knowledge of the life of the world there
bloomed on these occasions as specific remembrance that it was regarded
in that region in August and September as rather pleasant just to be
caught for something or other in passing through town Somebody was
always passing and somebody might catch somebody else It was in full
cognisance of this subtle law that she adhered to the most ridiculous
circuit she could have made to get home One warm dull featureless
Friday when an accident had made her start from Cockers a little later
than usual she became aware that something of which the infinite
possibilities had for so long peopled her dreams was at last prodigiously
upon her though the perfection in which the conditions happened to
present it was almost rich enough to be but the positive creation of a
dream She saw straight before her like a vista painted in a picture
the empty street and the lamps that burned pale in the dusk not yet
established It was into the convenience of this quiet twilight that a
gentleman on the doorstep of the Chambers gazed with a vagueness that our
young ladys little figure violently trembled in the approach with the
measure of its power to dissipate Everything indeed grew in a flash
terrific and distinct her old uncertainties fell away from her and
since she was so familiar with fate she felt as if the very nail that
fixed it were driven in by the hard look with which for a moment
Captain Everard awaited her

The vestibule was open behind him and the porter as absent as on the day
she had peeped in he had just come outwas in town in a tweed suit and
a pot hat but between two journeysduly bored over his evening and at a
loss what to do with it Then it was that she was glad she had never met
him in that way before she reaped with such ecstasy the benefit of his
not being able to think she passed often She jumped in two seconds to
the determination that he should even suppose it to be the very first
time and the very oddest chance this was while she still wondered if he
would identify or notice her His original attention had not she
instinctively knew been for the young woman at Cockers it had only
been for any young woman who might advance to the tune of her not
troubling the quiet air and in fact the poetic hour with ugliness Ah
but then and just as she had reached the door came his second
observation a long light reach with which visibly and quite amusedly
he recalled and placed her They were on different sides but the
street narrow and still had only made more of a stage for the small
momentary drama It was not over besides it was far from over even on
his sending across the way with the pleasantest laugh she had ever
heard a little lift of his hat and an Oh good evening It was still
less over on their meeting the next minute though rather indirectly and
awkwardly in the middle of the roada situation to which three or four
steps of her own had unmistakeably contributedand then passing not
again to the side on which she had arrived but back toward the portal of
Park Chambers

I didnt know you at first Are you taking a walk

Ah I dont take walks at night Im going home after my work

Oh

That was practically what they had meanwhile smiled out and his
exclamation to which for a minute he appeared to have nothing to add
left them face to face and in just such an attitude as for his part he
might have worn had he been wondering if he could properly ask her to
come in During this interval in fact she really felt his question to be
just _How_ properly It was simply a question of the degree of
properness




CHAPTER XV


She never knew afterwards quite what she had done to settle it and at
the time she only knew that they presently moved with vagueness yet
with continuity away from the picture of the lighted vestibule and the
quiet stairs and well up the street together This also must have been
in the absence of a definite permission of anything vulgarly articulate
for that matter on the part of either and it was to be later on a
thing of remembrance and reflexion for her that the limit of what just
here for a longish minute passed between them was his taking in her
thoroughly successful deprecation though conveyed without pride or sound
or touch of the idea that she might be out of the cage the very shop
girl at large that she hugged the theory she wasnt Yes it was
strange she afterwards thought that so much could have come and gone
and yet not disfigured the dear little intense crisis either with
impertinence or with resentment with any of the horrid notes of that
kind of acquaintance He had taken no liberty as she would have so
called it and through not having to betray the sense of one she
herself had still more charmingly taken none On the spot
nevertheless she could speculate as to what it meant that if his
relation with Lady Bradeen continued to be what her mind had built it up
to he should feel free to proceed with marked independence This was
one of the questions he was to leave her to deal withthe question
whether people of his sort still asked girls up to their rooms when they
were so awfully in love with other women Could people of his sort do
that without what people of her sort would call being false to their
love She had already a vision of how the true answer was that people
of her sort didnt in such cases matterdidnt count as infidelity
counted only as something else she might have been curious since it
came to that to see exactly what

Strolling together slowly in their summer twilight and their empty corner
of Mayfair they found themselves emerge at last opposite to one of the
smaller gates of the Park upon which without any particular word about
itthey were talking so of other thingsthey crossed the street and
went in and sat down on a bench She had gathered by this time one
magnificent hope about himthe hope he would say nothing vulgar She
knew thoroughly what she meant by that she meant something quite apart
from any matter of his being false Their bench was not far within it
was near the Park Lane paling and the patchy lamplight and the rumbling
cabs and buses A strange emotion had come to her and she felt indeed
excitement within excitement above all a conscious joy in testing him
with chances he didnt take She had an intense desire he should know
the type she really conformed to without her doing anything so low as
tell him and he had surely begun to know it from the moment he didnt
seize the opportunities into which a common man would promptly have
blundered These were on the mere awkward surface and _their_ relation
was beautiful behind and below them She had questioned so little on the
way what they might be doing that as soon as they were seated she took
straight hold of it Her hours her confinement the many conditions of
service in the postoffice hadwith a glance at his own postal
resources and alternativesformed up to this stage the subject of
their talk Well here we are and it may be right enough but this
isnt the least you know where I was going

You were going home

Yes and I was already rather late I was going to my supper

You havent had it

No indeed

Then you havent eaten

He looked of a sudden so extravagantly concerned that she laughed out
All day Yes we do feed once But that was long ago So I must
presently say goodbye

Oh deary _me_ he exclaimed with an intonation so droll and yet a touch
so light and a distress so markeda confession of helplessness for such
a case in short so unrelievedthat she at once felt sure she had made
the great difference plain He looked at her with the kindest eyes and
still without saying what she had known he wouldnt She had known he
wouldnt say Then sup with _me_ but the proof of it made her feel as
if she had feasted

Im not a bit hungry she went on

Ah you _must_ be awfully he made answer but settling himself on the
bench as if after all that neednt interfere with his spending his
evening Ive always quite wanted the chance to thank you for the
trouble you so often take for me

Yes I know she replied uttering the words with a sense of the
situation far deeper than any pretence of not fitting his allusion She
immediately felt him surprised and even a little puzzled at her frank
assent but for herself the trouble she had taken could only in these
fleeting minutesthey would probably never come backbe all there like
a little hoard of gold in her lap Certainly he might look at it handle
it take up the pieces Yet if he understood anything he must understand
all I consider youve already immensely thanked me The horror was
back upon her of having seemed to hang about for some reward Its
awfully odd you should have been there just the one time

The one time youve passed my place

Yes you can fancy I havent many minutes to waste There was a place
tonight I had to stop at

I see I see he knew already so much about her work It must be an
awful grindfor a lady

It is but I dont think I groan over it any more than my companionsand
youve seen _theyre_ not ladies She mildly jested but with an
intention One gets used to things and there are employments I should
have hated much more She had the finest conception of the beauty of
not at least boring him To whine to count up her wrongs was what a
barmaid or a shopgirl would do and it was quite enough to sit there
like one of these

If you had had another employment he remarked after a moment we
might never have become acquainted

Its highly probableand certainly not in the same way Then still
with her heap of gold in her lap and something of the pride of it in her
manner of holding her head she continued not to moveshe only smiled at
him The evening had thickened now the scattered lamps were red the
Park all before them was full of obscure and ambiguous life there were
other couples on other benches whom it was impossible not to see yet at
whom it was impossible to look But Ive walked so much out of my way
with you only just to show you thatthatwith this she paused it was
not after all so easy to expressthat anything you may have thought is
perfectly true

Oh Ive thought a tremendous lot her companion laughed Do you mind
my smoking

Why should I You always smoke _there_

At your place Oh yes but here its different

No she said as he lighted a cigarette thats just what it isnt
Its quite the same

Well then thats because there its so wonderful

Then youre conscious of how wonderful it is she returned

He jerked his handsome head in literal protest at a doubt Why thats
exactly what I mean by my gratitude for all your trouble It has been
just as if you took a particular interest She only looked at him by
way of answer in such sudden headlong embarrassment as she was quite
aware that while she remained silent he showed himself checked by her
expression You _have_havent youtaken a particular interest

Oh a particular interest she quavered out feeling the whole thingher
headlong embarrassmentget terribly the better of her and wishing with
a sudden scare all the more to keep her emotion down She maintained
her fixed smile a moment and turned her eyes over the peopled darkness
unconfused now because there was something much more confusing This
with a fatal great rush was simply the fact that they were thus
together They were near near and all she had imagined of that had
only become more true more dreadful and overwhelming She stared
straight away in silence till she felt she looked an idiot then to say
something to say nothing she attempted a sound which ended in a flood
of tears




CHAPTER XVI


Her tears helped her really to dissimulate for she had instantly in so
public a situation to recover herself They had come and gone in half a
minute and she immediately explained them Its only because Im
tired Its thatits that Then she added a trifle incoherently I
shall never see you again

Ah but why not The mere tone in which her companion asked this
satisfied her once for all as to the amount of imagination for which she
could count on him It was naturally not large it had exhausted itself
in having arrived at what he had already touched uponthe sense of an
intention in her poor zeal at Cockers But any deficiency of this kind
was no fault in him he wasnt obliged to have an inferior clevernessto
have secondrate resources and virtues It had been as if he almost
really believed she had simply cried for fatigue and he accordingly put
in some kind confused pleaYou ought really to take something wont
you have something or other _somewhere_ to which she had made no
response but a headshake of a sharpness that settled it Why shant we
all the more keep meeting

I mean meeting this wayonly this way At my place there_that_ Ive
nothing to do with and I hope of course youll turn up with your
correspondence when it suits you Whether I stay or not I mean for I
shall probably not stay

Youre going somewhere else he put it with positive anxiety

Yes ever so far awayto the other end of London There are all sorts
of reasons I cant tell you and its practically settled Its better
for me much and Ive only kept on at Cockers for _you_

For me

Making out in the dusk that he fairly blushed she now measured how far
he had been from knowing too much Too much she called it at present
and that was easy since it proved so abundantly enough for her that he
should simply be where he was As we shall never talk this way but to
nightnever never againhere it all is Ill say it I dont care
what you think it doesnt matter I only want to help you Besides
youre kindyoure kind Ive been thinking then of leaving for ever so
long But youve come so oftenat timesand youve had so much to do
and it has been so pleasant and interesting that Ive remained Ive
kept putting off any change More than once when I had nearly decided
youve turned up again and Ive thought Oh no Thats the simple
fact She had by this time got her confusion down so completely that
she could laugh This is what I meant when I said to you just now that
I knew Ive known perfectly that you knew I took trouble for you and
that knowledge has been for me and I seemed to see it was for you as if
there were somethingI dont know what to call itbetween us I mean
something unusual and good and awfully nicesomething not a bit horrid
or vulgar

She had by this time she could see produced a great effect on him but
she would have spoken the truth to herself had she at the same moment
declared that she didnt in the least care all the more that the effect
must be one of extreme perplexity What in it all was visibly clear
for him none the less was that he was tremendously glad he had met her
She held him and he was astonished at the force of it he was intent
immensely considerate His elbow was on the back of the seat and his
head with the pothat pushed quite back in a boyish way so that she
really saw almost for the first time his forehead and hair rested on the
hand into which he had crumpled his gloves Yes he assented its
not a bit horrid or vulgar

She just hung fire a moment then she brought out the whole truth Id
do anything for you Id do anything for you Never in her life had
she known anything so high and fine as this just letting him have it and
bravely and magnificently leaving it Didnt the place the associations
and circumstances perfectly make it sound what it wasnt and wasnt
that exactly the beauty

So she bravely and magnificently left it and little by little she felt
him take it up take it down as if they had been on a satin sofa in a
boudoir She had never seen a boudoir but there had been lots of
boudoirs in the telegrams What she had said at all events sank into
him so that after a minute he simply made a movement that had the result
of placing his hand on her ownpresently indeed that of her feeling
herself firmly enough grasped There was no pressure she need return
there was none she need decline she just sat admirably still satisfied
for the time with the surprise and bewilderment of the impression she
made on him His agitation was even greater on the whole than she had at
first allowed for I say you know you mustnt think of leaving he
at last broke out

Of leaving Cockers you mean

Yes you must stay on there whatever happens and help a fellow

She was silent a little partly because it was so strange and exquisite
to feel him watch her as if it really mattered to him and he were almost
in suspense Then you _have_ quite recognised what Ive tried to do
she asked

Why wasnt that exactly what I dashed over from my door just now to
thank you for

Yes so you said

And dont you believe it

She looked down a moment at his hand which continued to cover her own
whereupon he presently drew it back rather restlessly folding his arms
Without answering his question she went on Have you ever spoken of me

Spoken of you

Of my being thereof my knowing and that sort of thing

Oh never to a human creature he eagerly declared

She had a small drop at this which was expressed in another pause and
she then returned to what he had just asked her Oh yes I quite
believe you like itmy always being there and our taking things up so
familiarly and successfully if not exactly where we left them she
laughed almost always at least at an interesting point He was about
to say something in reply to this but her friendly gaiety was quicker
You want a great many things in life a great many comforts and helps
and luxuriesyou want everything as pleasant as possible Therefore so
far as its in the power of any particular person to contribute to all
that She had turned her face to him smiling just thinking

Oh see here But he was highly amused Well what then he enquired
as if to humour her

Why the particular person must never fail We must manage it for you
somehow

He threw back his head laughing out he was really exhilarated Oh
yes somehow

Well I think we each dodont wein one little way and another and
according to our limited lights Im pleased at any rate for myself
that you are for I assure you Ive done my best

You do better than any one He had struck a match for another
cigarette and the flame lighted an instant his responsive finished face
magnifying into a pleasant grimace the kindness with which he paid her
this tribute Youre awfully clever you know cleverer cleverer
cleverer He had appeared on the point of making some tremendous
statement then suddenly puffing his cigarette and shifting almost with
violence on his seat he let it altogether fall




CHAPTER XVII


In spite of this drop if not just by reason of it she felt as if Lady
Bradeen all but named out had popped straight up and she practically
betrayed her consciousness by waiting a little before she rejoined
Cleverer than who

Well if I wasnt afraid youd think I swagger I should saythan
anybody If you leave your place there where shall you go he more
gravely asked

Oh too far for you ever to find me

Id find you anywhere

The tone of this was so still more serious that she had but her one
acknowledgement Id do anything for youId do anything for you she
repeated She had already she felt said it all so what did anything
more anything less matter That was the very reason indeed why she
could with a lighter note ease him generously of any awkwardness
produced by solemnity either his own or hers Of course it must be
nice for you to be able to think there are people all about who feel in
such a way

In immediate appreciation of this however he only smoked without
looking at her But you dont want to give up your present work he at
last threw out I mean you _will_ stay in the postoffice

Oh yes I think Ive a genius for that

Rather No one can touch you With this he turned more to her again
But you can get with a move greater advantages

I can get in the suburbs cheaper lodgings I live with my mother We
need some space Theres a particular place that has other inducements

He just hesitated Where is it

Oh quite out of _your_ way Youd never have time

But I tell you Id go anywhere Dont you believe it

Yes for once or twice But youd soon see it wouldnt do for you

He smoked and considered seemed to stretch himself a little and with
his legs out surrender himself comfortably Well well wellI
believe everything you say I take it from youanything you likein
the most extraordinary way It struck her certainlyand almost without
bitternessthat the way in which she was already as if she had been an
old friend arranging for him and preparing the only magnificence she
could muster was quite the most extraordinary Dont _dont_ go he
presently went on I shall miss you too horribly

So that you just put it to me as a definite requestoh how she tried
to divest this of all sound of the hardness of bargaining That ought to
have been easy enough for what was she arranging to get Before he
could answer she had continued To be perfectly fair I should tell you I
recognise at Cockers certain strong attractions All you people come I
like all the horrors

The horrors

Those you allyou know the set I mean _your_ setshow me with as good
a conscience as if I had no more feeling than a letterbox

He looked quite excited at the way she put it Oh they dont know

Dont know Im not stupid No how should they

Yes how should they said the Captain sympathetically But isnt
horrors rather strong

What you _do_ is rather strong the girl promptly returned

What _I_ do

Your extravagance your selfishness your immorality your crimes she
pursued without heeding his expression

I _say_her companion showed the queerest stare

I like them as I tell youI revel in them But we neednt go into
that she quietly went on for all I get out of it is the harmless
pleasure of knowing I know I know I knowshe breathed it ever so
gently

Yes thats what has been between us he answered much more simply

She could enjoy his simplicity in silence and for a moment she did so
If I do stay because you want itand Im rather capable of thatthere
are two or three things I think you ought to remember One is you know
that Im there sometimes for days and weeks together without your ever
coming

Oh Ill come every day he honestly cried

She was on the point at this of imitating with her hand his movement of
shortly before but she checked herself and there was no want of effect
in her soothing substitute How can you How can you He had too
manifestly only to look at it there in the vulgarly animated gloom to
see that he couldnt and at this point by the mere action of his
silence everything they had so definitely not named the whole presence
round which they had been circling became part of their reference
settled in solidly between them It was as if then for a minute they sat
and saw it all in each others eyes saw so much that there was no need
of a pretext for sounding it at last Your danger your danger Her
voice indeed trembled with it and she could only for the moment again
leave it so

During this moment he leaned back on the bench meeting her in silence
and with a face that grew more strange It grew so strange that after a
further instant she got straight up She stood there as if their talk
were now over and he just sat and watched her It was as if nowowing
to the third person they had brought inthey must be more careful so
that the most he could finally say was Thats where it is

Thats where it is the girl as guardedly replied He sat still and
she added I wont give you up Goodbye

Goodbyehe appealed but without moving

I dont quite see my way but I wont give you up she repeated
There Goodbye

It brought him with a jerk to his feet tossing away his cigarette His
poor face was flushed See heresee here

No I wont but I must leave you now she went on as if not hearing
him

See heresee here He tried from the bench to take her hand again

But that definitely settled it for her this would after all be as bad
as his asking her to supper You mustnt come with meno no

He sank back quite blank as if she had pushed him I maynt see you
home

No no let me go He looked almost as if she had struck him but she
didnt care and the manner in which she spokeit was literally as if
she were angryhad the force of a command Stay where you are

See heresee here he nevertheless pleaded

I wont give you up she cried once morethis time quite with passion
on which she got away from him as fast as she could and left him staring
after her




CHAPTER XVIII


Mr Mudge had lately been so occupied with their famous plans that he
had neglected for a while the question of her transfer but down at
Bournemouth which had found itself selected as the field of their
recreation by a process consisting it seemed exclusively of innumerable
pages of the neatest arithmetic in a very greasy but most orderly little
pocketbook the distracting possible melted awaythe fleeting absolute
ruled the scene The plans hour by hour were simply superseded and it
was much of a rest to the girl as she sat on the pier and overlooked the
sea and the company to see them evaporate in rosy fumes and to feel that
from moment to moment there was less left to cipher about The week
proves blissfully fine and her mother at their lodgingspartly to her
embarrassment and partly to her reliefstruck up with the landlady an
alliance that left the younger couple a great deal of freedom This
relative took her pleasure of a week at Bournemouth in a stuffy
backkitchen and endless talks to that degree even that Mr Mudge
himselfhabitually inclined indeed to a scrutiny of all mysteries and to
seeing as he sometimes admitted too much in thingsmade remarks on it
as he sat on the cliff with his betrothed or on the decks of steamers
that conveyed them closepacked items in terrific totals of enjoyment
to the Isle of Wight and the Dorset coast

He had a lodging in another house where he had speedily learned the
importance of keeping his eyes open and he made no secret of his
suspecting that sinister mutual connivances might spring under the roof
of his companions from unnatural sociabilities At the same time he
fully recognised that as a source of anxiety not to say of expense his
future motherin law would have weighted them more by accompanying their
steps than by giving her hostess in the interest of the tendency they
considered that they never mentioned equivalent pledges as to the tea
caddy and the jampot These were the questionsthese indeed the
familiar commoditiesthat he had now to put into the scales and his
betrothed had in consequence during her holiday the odd and yet
pleasant and almost languid sense of an anticlimax She had become
conscious of an extraordinary collapse a surrender to stillness and to
retrospect She cared neither to walk nor to sail it was enough for her
to sit on benches and wonder at the sea and taste the air and not be at
Cockers and not see the counterclerk She still seemed to wait for
somethingsomething in the key of the immense discussions that had
mapped out their little week of idleness on the scale of a worldatlas
Something came at last but without perhaps appearing quite adequately to
crown the monument

Preparation and precaution were however the natural flowers of Mr
Mudges mind and in proportion as these things declined in one quarter
they inevitably bloomed elsewhere He could always at the worst have
on Tuesday the project of their taking the Swanage boat on Thursday and
on Thursday that of their ordering minced kidneys on Saturday He had
moreover a constant gift of inexorable enquiry as to where and what they
should have gone and have done if they hadnt been exactly as they were
He had in short his resources and his mistress had never been so
conscious of them on the other hand they never interfered so little with
her own She liked to be as she wasif it could only have lasted She
could accept even without bitterness a rigour of economy so great that
the little fee they paid for admission to the pier had to be balanced
against other delights The people at Ladles and at Thrupps had
_their_ ways of amusing themselves whereas she had to sit and hear Mr
Mudge talk of what he might do if he didnt take a bath or of the bath
he might take if he only hadnt taken something else He was always with
her now of course always beside her she saw him more than hourly
more than ever yet more even than he had planned she should do at Chalk
Farm She preferred to sit at the far end away from the band and the
crowd as to which she had frequent differences with her friend who
reminded her often that they could have only in the thick of it the sense
of the money they were getting back That had little effect on her for
she got back her money by seeing many things the things of the past
year fall together and connect themselves undergo the happy relegation
that transforms melancholy and misery passion and effort into
experience and knowledge

She liked having done with them as she assured herself she had
practically done and the strange thing was that she neither missed the
procession now nor wished to keep her place for it It had become there
in the sun and the breeze and the seasmell a faraway story a picture
of another life If Mr Mudge himself liked processions liked them at
Bournemouth and on the pier quite as much as at Chalk Farm or anywhere
she learned after a little not to be worried by his perpetual counting of
the figures that made them up There were dreadful women in particular
usually fat and in mens caps and write shoes whom he could never let
alonenot that she cared it was not the great world the world of
Cockers and Ladles and Thrupps but it offered an endless field to his
faculties of memory philosophy and frolic She had never accepted him
so much never arranged so successfully for making him chatter while she
carried on secret conversations This separate commerce was with
herself and if they both practised a great thrift she had quite mastered
that of merely spending words enough to keep him imperturbably and
continuously going

He was charmed with the panorama not knowingor at any rate not at all
showing that he knewwhat far other images peopled her mind than the
women in the navy caps and the shopboys in the blazers His
observations on these types his general interpretation of the show
brought home to her the prospect of Chalk Farm She wondered sometimes
that he should have derived so little illumination during his period
from the society at Cockers But one evening while their holiday
cloudlessly waned he gave her such a proof of his quality as might have
made her ashamed of her many suppressions He brought out something
that in all his overflow he had been able to keep back till other
matters were disposed of It was the announcement that he was at last
ready to marrythat he saw his way A rise at Chalk Farm had been
offered him he was to be taken into the business bringing with him a
capital the estimation of which by other parties constituted the
handsomest recognition yet made of the head on his shoulders Therefore
their waiting was overit could be a question of a near date They
would settle this date before going back and he meanwhile had his eye on
a sweet little home He would take her to see it on their first Sunday




CHAPTER XIX


His having kept this great news for the last having had such a card up
his sleeve and not floated it out in the current of his chatter and the
luxury of their leisure was one of those incalculable strokes by which
he could still affect her the kind of thing that reminded her of the
latent force that had ejected the drunken soldieran example of the
profundity of which his promotion was the proof She listened a while in
silence on this occasion to the wafted strains of the music she took
it in as she had not quite done before that her future was now
constituted Mr Mudge was distinctly her fate yet at this moment she
turned her face quite away from him showing him so long a mere quarter
of her cheek that she at last again heard his voice He couldnt see a
pair of tears that were partly the reason of her delay to give him the
assurance he required but he expressed at a venture the hope that she
had had her fill of Cockers

She was finally able to turn back Oh quite Theres nothing going on
No one comes but the Americans at Thrupps and they dont do much They
dont seem to have a secret in the world

Then the extraordinary reason youve been giving me for holding on there
has ceased to work

She thought a moment Yes that one Ive seen the thing throughIve
got them all in my pocket

So youre ready to come

For a little again she made no answer No not yet all the same Ive
still got a reasona different one

He looked her all over as if it might have been something she kept in her
mouth or her glove or under her jacketsomething she was even sitting
upon Well Ill have it please

I went out the other night and sat in the Park with a gentleman she
said at last

Nothing was ever seen like his confidence in her and she wondered a
little now why it didnt irritate her It only gave her ease and space
as she felt for telling him the whole truth that no one knew It had
arrived at present at her really wanting to do that and yet to do it not
in the least for Mr Mudge but altogether and only for herself This
truth filled out for her there the whole experience about to relinquish
suffused and coloured it as a picture that she should keep and that
describe it as she might no one but herself would ever really see
Moreover she had no desire whatever to make Mr Mudge jealous there
would be no amusement in it for the amusement she had lately known had
spoiled her for lower pleasures There were even no materials for it
The odd thing was how she never doubted that properly handled his
passion was poisonable what had happened was that he had cannily
selected a partner with no poison to distil She read then and there
that she should never interest herself in anybody as to whom some other
sentiment some superior view wouldnt be sure to interfere for him with
jealousy And what did you get out of that he asked with a concern
that was not in the least for his honour

Nothing but a good chance to promise him I wouldnt forsake him Hes
one of my customers

Then its for him not to forsake _you_

Well he wont Its all right But I must just keep on as long as he
may want me

Want you to sit with him in the Park

He may want me for thatbut I shant I rather liked it but once
under the circumstances is enough I can do better for him in another
manner

And what manner pray

Well elsewhere

ElsewhereI _say_

This was an ejaculation used also by Captain Everard but oh with what a
different sound You neednt saytheres nothing to be said And
yet you ought perhaps to know

Certainly I ought But _what_up to now

Why exactly what I told him That Id do anything for him

What do you mean by anything

Everything

Mr Mudges immediate comment on this statement was to draw from his
pocket a crumpled paper containing the remains of half a pound of
sundries These sundries had figured conspicuously in his prospective
sketch of their tour but it was only at the end of three days that they
had defined themselves unmistakeably as chocolatecreams Have
another_that_ one he said She had another but not the one he
indicated and then he continued What took place afterwards

Afterwards

What did you do when you had told him youd do everything

I simply came away

Out of the Park

Yes leaving him there I didnt let him follow me

Then what did you let him do

I didnt let him do anything

Mr Mudge considered an instant Then what did you go there for His
tone was even slightly critical

I didnt quite know at the time It was simply to be with him I
supposejust once Hes in danger and I wanted him to know I know it
It makes meeting himat Cockers since its that I want to stay on
formore interesting

It makes it mighty interesting for _me_ Mr Mudge freely declared
Yet he didnt follow you he asked _I_ would

Yes of course That was the way you began you know Youre awfully
inferior to him

Well my dear youre not inferior to anybody Youve got a cheek
Whats he in danger of

Of being found out Hes in love with a ladyand it isnt rightand
Ive found him out

Thatll be a lookout for _me_ Mr Mudge joked You mean she has a
husband

Never mind what she has Theyre in awful danger but his is the worst
because hes in danger from her too

Like me from youthe woman _I_ love If hes in the same funk as me

Hes in a worse one Hes not only afraid of the ladyhes afraid of
other things

Mr Mudge selected another chocolatecream Well Im only afraid of
one But how in the world can you help this party

I dont knowperhaps not at all But so long as theres a chance

You wont come away

No youve got to wait for me

Mr Mudge enjoyed what was in his mouth And what will he give you

Give me

If you do help him

Nothing Nothing in all the wide world

Then what will he give _me_ Mr Mudge enquired I mean for waiting

The girl thought a moment then she got up to walk He never heard of
you she replied

You havent mentioned me

We never mention anything What Ive told you is just what Ive found
out

Mr Mudge who had remained on the bench looked up at her she often
preferred to be quiet when he proposed to walk but now that he seemed to
wish to sit she had a desire to move But you havent told me what _he_
has found out

She considered her lover Hed never find _you_ my dear

Her lover still on his seat appealed to her in something of the
attitude in which she had last left Captain Everard but the impression
was not the same Then where do I come in

You dont come in at all Thats just the beauty of itand with this
she turned to mingle with the multitude collected round the band Mr
Mudge presently overtook her and drew her arm into his own with a quiet
force that expressed the serenity of possession in consonance with which
it was only when they parted for the night at her door that he referred
again to what she had told him

Have you seen him since

Since the night in the Park No not once

Oh what a cad said Mr Mudge




CHAPTER XX


It was not till the end of October that she saw Captain Everard again
and on that occasionthe only one of all the series on which hindrance
had been so utterno communication with him proved possible She had
made out even from the cage that it was a charming golden day a patch of
hazy autumn sunlight lay across the sanded floor and also higher up
quickened into brightness a row of ruddy bottled syrups Work was slack
and the place in general empty the town as they said in the cage had
not waked up and the feeling of the day likened itself to something than
in happier conditions she would have thought of romantically as Saint
Martins summer The counterclerk had gone to his dinner she herself
was busy with arrears of postal jobs in the midst of which she became
aware that Captain Everard had apparently been in the shop a minute and
that Mr Buckton had already seized him

He had as usual half a dozen telegrams and when he saw that she saw him
and their eyes met he gave on bowing to her an exaggerated laugh in
which she read a new consciousness It was a confession of awkwardness
it seemed to tell her that of course he knew he ought better to have kept
his head ought to have been clever enough to wait on some pretext till
he should have found her free Mr Buckton was a long time with him and
her attention was soon demanded by other visitors so that nothing passed
between them but the fulness of their silence The look she took from
him was his greeting and the other one a simple sign of the eyes sent
her before going out The only token they exchanged therefore was his
tacit assent to her wish that since they couldnt attempt a certain
frankness they should attempt nothing at all This was her intense
preference she could be as still and cold as any one when that was the
sole solution

Yet more than any contact hitherto achieved these counted instants struck
her as marking a step they were built sojust in the mere flashon the
recognition of his now definitely knowing what it was she would do for
him The anything anything she had uttered in the Park went to and
fro between them and under the pokedout china that interposed It had
all at last even put on the air of their not needing now clumsily to
manoeuvre to converse their former little postal makebelieves the
intense implications of questions and answers and change had become in
the light of the personal fact of their having had their moment a
possibility comparatively poor It was as if they had met for all
timeit exerted on their being in presence again an influence so
prodigious When she watched herself in the memory of that night walk
away from him as if she were making an end she found something too
pitiful in the primness of such a gait Hadnt she precisely established
on the part of each a consciousness that could end only with death

It must be admitted that in spite of this brave margin an irritation
after he had gone remained with her a sense that presently became one
with a still sharper hatred of Mr Buckton who on her friends
withdrawal had retired with the telegrams to the sounder and left her
the other work She knew indeed she should have a chance to see them
when she would on file and she was divided as the day went on between
the two impressions of all that was lost and all that was reasserted
What beset her above all and as she had almost never known it before
was the desire to bound straight out to overtake the autumn afternoon
before it passed away for ever and hurry off to the Park and perhaps be
with him there again on a bench It became for an hour a fantastic
vision with her that he might just have gone to sit and wait for her She
could almost hear him through the tick of the sounder scatter with his
stick in his impatience the fallen leaves of October Why should such
a vision seize her at this particular moment with such a shake There
was a timefrom four to fivewhen she could have cried with happiness
and rage

Business quickened it seemed toward five as if the town did wake up
she had therefore more to do and she went through it with little sharp
stampings and jerkings she made the crisp postalorders fairly snap
while she breathed to herself Its the last daythe last day The
last day of what She couldnt have told All she knew now was that if
she _were_ out of the cage she wouldnt in the least have minded this
time its not yet being dark She would have gone straight toward Park
Chambers and have hung about there till no matter when She would have
waited stayed rung asked have gone in sat on the stairs What the
day was the last of was probably to her strained inner sense the group
of golden ones of any occasion for seeing the hazy sunshine slant at
that angle into the smelly shop of any range of chances for his wishing
still to repeat to her the two words she had in the Park scarcely let him
bring out See heresee herethe sound of these two words had been
with her perpetually but it was in her ears today without mercy with a
loudness that grew and grew What was it they then expressed what was
it he had wanted her to see She seemed whatever it was perfectly to
see it nowto see that if she should just chuck the whole thing should
have a great and beautiful courage he would somehow make everything up
to her When the clock struck five she was on the very point of saying
to Mr Buckton that she was deadly ill and rapidly getting worse This
announcement was on her lips and she had quite composed the pale hard
face she would offer him I cant stopI must go home If I feel
better later on Ill come back Im very sorry but I _must_ go At
that instant Captain Everard once more stood there producing in her
agitated spirit by his real presence the strangest quickest
revolution He stopped her off without knowing it and by the time he
had been a minute in the shop she felt herself saved

That was from the first minute how she thought of it There were again
other persons with whom she was occupied and again the situation could
only be expressed by their silence It was expressed of a truth in a
larger phrase than ever yet for her eyes now spoke to him with a kind of
supplication Be quiet be quiet they pleaded and they saw his own
reply Ill do whatever you say I wont even look at yousee see
They kept conveying thus with the friendliest liberality that they
wouldnt look quite positively wouldnt What she was to see was that
he hovered at the other end of the counter Mr Bucktons end and
surrendered himself again to that frustration It quickly proved so
great indeed that what she was to see further was how he turned away
before he was attended to and hung off waiting smoking looking about
the shop how he went over to Mr Cockers own counter and appeared to
price things gave in fact presently two or three orders and put down
money stood there a long time with his back to her considerately
abstaining from any glance round to see if she were free It at last
came to pass in this way that he had remained in the shop longer than she
had ever yet known to do and that nevertheless when he did turn about
she could see him time himselfshe was freshly taken upand cross
straight to her postal subordinate whom some one else had released He
had in his hand all this while neither letters nor telegrams and now
that he was close to herfor she was close to the counterclerkit
brought her heart into her mouth merely to see him look at her neighbour
and open his lips She was too nervous to bear it He asked for a Post
Office Guide and the young man whipped out a new one whereupon he said
he wished not to purchase but only to consult one a moment with which
the copy kept on loan being produced he once more wandered off

What was he doing to her What did he want of her Well it was just
the aggravation of his See here She felt at this moment strangely and
portentously afraid of himhad in her ears the hum of a sense that
should it come to that kind of tension she must fly on the spot to Chalk
Farm Mixed with her dread and with her reflexion was the idea that if
he wanted her so much as he seemed to show it might be after all simply
to do for him the anything she had promised the everything she had
thought it so fine to bring out to Mr Mudge He might want her to help
him might have some particular appeal though indeed his manner didnt
denote thatdenoted on the contrary an embarrassment an indecision
something of a desire not so much to be helped as to be treated rather
more nicely than she had treated him the other time Yes he considered
quite probably that he had help rather to offer than to ask for Still
none the less when he again saw her free he continued to keep away from
her when he came back with his thumbed Guide it was Mr Buckton he
caughtit was from Mr Buckton he obtained halfacrownsworth of
stamps

After asking for the stamps he asked quite as a second thought for a
postalorder for ten shillings What did he want with so many stamps
when he wrote so few letters How could he enclose a postalorder in a
telegram She expected him the next thing to go into the corner and
make up one of his telegramshalf a dozen of themon purpose to prolong
his presence She had so completely stopped looking at him that she
could only guess his movementsguess even where his eyes rested Finally
she saw him make a dash that might have been toward the nook where the
forms were hung and at this she suddenly felt that she couldnt keep it
up The counterclerk had just taken a telegram from a slavey and to
give herself something to cover her she snatched it out of his hand The
gesture was so violent that he gave her in return an odd look and she
also perceived that Mr Buckton noticed it The latter personage with a
quick stare at her appeared for an instant to wonder whether his
snatching it in _his_ turn mightnt be the thing she would least like
and she anticipated this practical criticism by the frankest glare she
had ever given him It sufficed this time it paralysed him and she
sought with her trophy the refuge of the sounder




CHAPTER XXI


It was repeated the next day it went on for three days and at the end
of that time she knew what to think When at the beginning she had
emerged from her temporary shelter Captain Everard had quitted the shop
and he had not come again that evening as it had struck her he possibly
mightmight all the more easily that there were numberless persons who
came morning and afternoon numberless times so that he wouldnt
necessarily have attracted attention The second day it was different
and yet on the whole worse His access to her had become possibleshe
felt herself even reaping the fruit of her yesterdays glare at Mr
Buckton but transacting his business with him didnt simplifyit could
in spite of the rigour of circumstance feed so her new conviction The
rigour was tremendous and his telegramsnot now mere pretexts for
getting at herwere apparently genuine yet the conviction had taken but
a night to develop It could be simply enough expressed she had had the
glimmer of it the day before in her idea that he needed no more help than
she had already given that it was help he himself was prepared to
render He had come up to town but for three or four days he had been
absolutely obliged to be absent after the other time yet he would now
that he was face to face with her stay on as much longer as she liked
Little by little it was thus clarified though from the first flash of
his reappearance she had read into it the real essence

That was what the night before at eight oclock her hour to go had
made her hang back and dawdle She did last things or pretended to do
them to be in the cage had suddenly become her safety and she was
literally afraid of the alternate self who might be waiting outside _He_
might be waiting it was he who was her alternate self and of him she
was afraid The most extraordinary change had taken place in her from
the moment of her catching the impression he seemed to have returned on
purpose to give her Just before she had done so on that bewitched
afternoon she had seen herself approach without a scruple the porter at
Park Chambers then as the effect of the rush of a consciousness quite
altered she had on at last quitting Cockers gone straight home for the
first time since her return from Bournemouth She had passed his door
every night for weeks but nothing would have induced her to pass it now
This change was the tribute of her fearthe result of a change in
himself as to which she needed no more explanation than his mere face
vividly gave her strange though it was to find an element of deterrence
in the object that she regarded as the most beautiful in the world He
had taken it from her in the Park that night that she wanted him not to
propose to her to sup but he had put away the lesson by this timehe
practically proposed supper every time he looked at her This was what
for that matter mainly filled the three days He came in twice on each
of these and it was as if he came in to give her a chance to relent
That was after all she said to herself in the intervals the most that
he did There were ways she fully recognised in which he spared her
and other particular ways as to which she meant that her silence should
be full to him of exquisite pleading The most particular of all was his
not being outside at the corner when she quitted the place for the
night This he might so easily have beenso easily if he hadnt been so
nice She continued to recognise in his forbearance the fruit of her
dumb supplication and the only compensation he found for it was the
harmless freedom of being able to appear to say Yes Im in town only
for three or four days but you know I _would_ stay on He struck her
as calling attention each day each hour to the rapid ebb of time he
exaggerated to the point of putting it that there were only two days
more that there was at last dreadfully only one

There were other things still that he struck her as doing with a special
intention as to the most marked of whichunless indeed it were the most
obscureshe might well have marvelled that it didnt seem to her more
horrid It was either the frenzy of her imagination or the disorder of
his baffled passion that gave her once or twice the vision of his putting
down redundant moneysovereigns not concerned with the little payments
he was perpetually makingso that she might give him some sign of
helping him to slip them over to her What was most extraordinary in
this impression was the amount of excuse that with some incoherence she
found for him He wanted to pay her because there was nothing to pay her
for He wanted to offer her things he knew she wouldnt take He wanted
to show her how much he respected her by giving her the supreme chance to
show _him_ she was respectable Over the dryest transactions at any
rate their eyes had out these questions On the third day he put in a
telegram that had evidently something of the same point as the stray
sovereignsa message that was in the first place concocted and that on a
second thought he took back from her before she had stamped it He had
given her time to read it and had only then bethought himself that he had
better not send it If it was not to Lady Bradeen at Twindlewhere she
knew her ladyship then to bethis was because an address to Doctor
Buzzard at Brickwood was just as good with the added merit of its not
giving away quite so much a person whom he had still after all in a
manner to consider It was of course most complicated only half
lighted but there was discernibly enough a scheme of communication in
which Lady Bradeen at Twindle and Dr Buzzard at Brickwood were within
limits one and the same person The words he had shown her and then
taken back consisted at all events of the brief but vivid phrase
Absolutely impossible The point was not that she should transmit it
the point was just that she should see it What was absolutely
impossible was that before he had setted something at Cockers he should
go either to Twindle or to Brickwood

The logic of this in turn for herself was that she could lend herself
to no settlement so long as she so intensely knew What she knew was
that he was almost under peril of life clenched in a situation
therefore how could she also know where a poor girl in the PO might
really stand It was more and more between them that if he might convey
to her he was free with all the impossible locked away into a closed
chapter her own case might become different for her she might
understand and meet him and listen But he could convey nothing of the
sort and he only fidgeted and floundered in his want of power The
chapter wasnt in the least closed not for the other party and the
other party had a pull somehow and somewhere this his whole attitude
and expression confessed at the same time that they entreated her not to
remember and not to mind So long as she did remember and did mind he
could only circle about and go and come doing futile things of which he
was ashamed He was ashamed of his two words to Dr Buzzard he went out
of the shop as soon as he had crumpled up the paper again and thrust it
into his pocket It had been an abject little exposure of dreadful
impossible passion He appeared in fact to be too ashamed to come back
He had once more left town and a first week elapsed and a second He
had had naturally to return to the real mistress of his fate she had
insistedshe knew how to insist and he couldnt put in another hour
There was always a day when she called time It was known to our young
friend moreover that he had now been dispatching telegrams from other
offices She knew at last so much that she had quite lost her earlier
sense of merely guessing There were no different shades of
distinctnessit all bounced out




CHAPTER XXII


Eighteen days elapsed and she had begun to think it probable she should
never see him again He too then understood now he had made out that
she had secrets and reasons and impediments that even a poor girl at the
PO might have her complications With the charm she had cast on him
lightened by distance he had suffered a final delicacy to speak to him
had made up his mind that it would be only decent to let her alone Never
so much as during these latter days had she felt the precariousness of
their relationthe happy beautiful untroubled original one if it could
only have been restoredin which the public servant and the casual
public only were concerned It hung at the best by the merest silken
thread which was at the mercy of any accident and might snap at any
minute She arrived by the end of the fortnight at the highest sense of
actual fitness never doubting that her decision was now complete She
would just give him a few days more to come back to her on a proper
impersonal basisfor even to an embarrassing representative of the
casual public a public servant with a conscience did owe somethingand
then would signify to Mr Mudge that she was ready for the little home
It had been visited in the further talk she had had with him at
Bournemouth from garret to cellar and they had especially lingered
with their respectively darkened brows before the niche into which it
was to be broached to her mother that she must find means to fit

He had put it to her more definitely than before that his calculations
had allowed for that dingy presence and he had thereby marked the
greatest impression he had ever made on her It was a stroke superior
even again to his handling of the drunken soldier What she considered
that in the face of it she hung on at Cockers for was something she
could only have described as the common fairness of a last word Her
actual last word had been till it should be superseded that she
wouldnt forsake her other friend and it stuck to her through thick and
thin that she was still at her post and on her honour This other friend
had shown so much beauty of conduct already that he would surely after
all just reappear long enough to relieve her to give her something she
could take away She saw it caught it at times his parting present
and there were moments when she felt herself sitting like a beggar with a
hand held out to almsgiver who only fumbled She hadnt taken the
sovereigns but she _would_ take the penny She heard in imagination
on the counter the ring of the copper Dont put yourself out any
longer he would say for so bad a case Youve done all there is to
be done I thank and acquit and release you Our lives take us I
dont know muchthough Ive really been interestedabout yours but I
suppose youve got one Mine at any rate will take _me_and where it
will Heighho Goodbye And then once more for the sweetest
faintest flower of all Only I saysee here She had framed the
whole picture with a squareness that included also the image of how again
she would decline to see there decline as she might say to see
anywhere see anything Yet it befell that just in the fury of this
escape she saw more than ever

He came back one night with a rush near the moment of their closing and
showed her a face so different and new so upset and anxious that almost
anything seemed to look out of it but clear recognition He poked in a
telegram very much as if the simple sense of pressure the distress of
extreme haste had blurred the remembrance of where in particular he was
But as she met his eyes a light came it broke indeed on the spot into a
positive conscious glare That made up for everything since it was an
instant proclamation of the celebrated danger it seemed to pour things
out in a flood Oh yes here it isits upon me at last Forget for
Gods sake my having worried or bored you and just help me just _save_
me by getting this off without the loss of a second Something grave
had clearly occurred a crisis declared itself She recognised
immediately the person to whom the telegram was addressedthe Miss
Dolman of Parade Lodge to whom Lady Bradeen had wired at Dover on the
last occasion and whom she had then with her recollection of previous
arrangements fitted into a particular setting Miss Dolman had figured
before and not figured since but she was now the subject of an
imperative appeal Absolutely necessary to see you Take last train
Victoria if you can catch it If not earliest morning and answer me
direct either way

Reply paid said the girl Mr Buckton had just departed and the
counterclerk was at the sounder There was no other representative of
the public and she had never yet as it seemed to her not even in the
street or in the Park been so alone with him

Oh yes reply paid and as sharp as possible please

She affixed the stamps in a flash Shell catch the train she then
declared to him breathlessly as if she could absolutely guarantee it

I dont knowI hope so Its awfully important So kind of you
Awfully sharp please It was wonderfully innocent now his oblivion of
all but his danger Anything else that had ever passed between them was
utterly out of it Well she had wanted him to be impersonal

There was less of the same need therefore happily for herself yet she
only took time before she flew to the sounder to gasp at him Youre
in trouble

Horrid horridtheres a row But they parted on it in the next
breath and as she dashed at the sounder almost pushing in her
violence the counterclerk off the stool she caught the bang with
which at Cockers door in his further precipitation he closed the
apron of the cab into which he had leaped As he rebounded to some other
precaution suggested by his alarm his appeal to Miss Dolman flashed
straight away

But she had not on the morrow been in the place five minutes before he
was with her again still more discomposed and quite now as she said to
herself like a frightened child coming to its mother Her companions
were there and she felt it to be remarkable how in the presence of his
agitation his mere scared exposed nature she suddenly ceased to mind
It came to her as it had never come to her before that with absolute
directness and assurance they might carry almost anything off He had
nothing to sendshe was sure he had been wiring all overand yet his
business was evidently huge There was nothing but that in his eyesnot
a glimmer of reference or memory He was almost haggard with anxiety and
had clearly not slept a wink Her pity for him would have given her any
courage and she seemed to know at last why she had been such a fool
She didnt come she panted

Oh yes she came but there has been some mistake We want a telegram

A telegram

One that was sent from here ever so long ago There was something in it
that has to be recovered Something very very important pleasewe
want it immediately

He really spoke to her as if she had been some strange young woman at
Knightsbridge or Paddington but it had no other effect on her than to
give her the measure of his tremendous flurry Then it was that above
all she felt how much she had missed in the gaps and blanks and absent
answershow much she had had to dispense with it was now black darkness
save for this little wild red flare So much as that she saw so much
her mind dealt with One of the lovers was quaking somewhere out of
town and the other was quaking just where he stood This was vivid
enough and after an instant she knew it was all she wanted She wanted
no detail no factshe wanted no nearer vision of discovery or shame
When was your telegram Do you mean you sent it from here She tried
to do the young woman at Knightsbridge

Oh yes from hereseveral weeks ago Five six sevenhe was
confused and impatientdont you remember

Remember she could scarcely keep out of her face at the word the
strangest of smiles

But the way he didnt catch what it meant was perhaps even stranger
still I mean dont you keep the old ones

For a certain time

But how long

She thought she must do the young woman and she knew exactly what the
young woman would say and still more wouldnt Can you give me the
date

Oh God no It was some time or other in Augusttoward the end It
was to the same address as the one I gave you last night

Oh said the girl knowing at this the deepest thrill she had ever
felt It came to her there with her eyes on his face that she held the
whole thing in her hand held it as she held her pencil which might have
broken at that instant in her tightened grip This made her feel like
the very fountain of fate but the emotion was such a flood that she had
to press it back with all her force That was positively the reason
again of her flutelike Paddington tone You cant give us anything a
little nearer Her little and her us came straight from Paddington
These things were no false note for himhis difficulty absorbed them
all The eyes with which he pressed her and in the depths of which she
read terror and rage and literal tears were just the same he would have
shown any other prim person

I dont know the date I only know the thing went from here and just
about the time I speak of It wasnt delivered you see Weve got to
recover it




CHAPTER XXIII


She was as struck with the beauty of his plural pronoun as she had judged
he might be with that of her own but she knew now so well what she was
about that she could almost play with him and with her newborn joy You
say about the time you speak of But I dont think you speak of an
exact timedo you

He looked splendidly helpless Thats just what I want to find out
Dont you keep the old onescant you look it up

Our young ladystill at Paddingtonturned the question over It
wasnt delivered

Yes it _was_ yet at the same time dont you know it wasnt He
just hung back but he brought it out I mean it was intercepted dont
you know and there was something in it He paused again and as if to
further his quest and woo and supplicate success and recovery even
smiled with an effort at the agreeable that was almost ghastly and that
turned the knife in her tenderness What must be the pain of it all of
the open gulf and the throbbing fever when this was the mere hot breath
We want to get what was in itto know what it was

I seeI see She managed just the accent they had at Paddington when
they stared like dead fish And you have no clue

Not at allIve the clue Ive just given you

Oh the last of August If she kept it up long enough she would make
him really angry

Yes and the address as Ive said

Oh the same as last night

He visibly quivered as with a gleam of hope but it only poured oil on
her quietude and she was still deliberate She ranged some papers
Wont you look he went on

I remember your coming she replied

He blinked with a new uneasiness it might have begun to come to him
through her difference that he was somehow different himself You were
much quicker then you know

So were youyou must do me that justice she answered with a smile
But let me see Wasnt it Dover

Yes Miss Dolman

Parade Lodge Parade Terrace

Exactlythank you so awfully much He began to hope again Then you
_have_ itthe other one

She hesitated afresh she quite dangled him It was brought by a lady

Yes and she put in by mistake something wrong Thats what weve got
to get hold of Heavens what was he going to sayflooding poor
Paddington with wild betrayals She couldnt too much for her joy
dangle him yet she couldnt either for his dignity warn or control or
check him What she found herself doing was just to treat herself to the
middle way It was intercepted

It fell into the wrong hands But theres something in it he
continued to blurt out that _may_ be all right That is if its
wrong dont you know Its all right if its wrong he remarkably
explained

What _was_ he on earth going to say Mr Buckton and the counterclerk
were already interested no one would have the decency to come in and
she was divided between her particular terror for him and her general
curiosity Yet she already saw with what brilliancy she could add to
carry the thing off a little false knowledge to all her real I quite
understand she said with benevolent with almost patronising quickness
The lady has forgotten what she did put

Forgotten most wretchedly and its an immense inconvenience It has
only just been found that it didnt get there so that if we could
immediately have it

Immediately

Every minute counts You have he pleaded surely got them on file

So that you can see it on the spot

Yes pleasethis very minute The counter rang with his knuckles
with the knob of his stick with his panic of alarm Do _do_ hunt it
up he repeated

I dare say we could get it for you the girl weetly returned

Get ithe looked aghast When

Probably by tomorrow

Then it isnt herehis face was pitiful

She caught only the uncovered gleams that peeped out of the blackness
and she wondered what complication even among the most supposable the
very worst could be bad enough to account for the degree of his terror
There were twists and turns there were places where the screw drew
blood that she couldnt guess She was more and more glad she didnt
want to It has been sent on

But how do you know if you dont look

She gave him a smile that was meant to be in the absolute irony of its
propriety quite divine It was August 23rd and weve nothing later
here than August 27th

Something leaped into his face 27th23rd Then youre sure You
know

She felt she scarce knew whatas if she might soon be pounced upon for
some lurid connexion with a scandal It was the queerest of all
sensations for she had heard she had read of these things and the
wealth of her intimacy with them at Cockers might be supposed to have
schooled and seasoned her This particular one that she had really quite
lived with was after all an old story yet what it had been before was
dim and distant beside the touch under which she now winced Scandalit
had never been but a silly word Now it was a great tense surface and
the surface was somehow Captain Everards wonderful face Deep down in
his eyes a picture a scenea great place like a chamber of justice
where before a watching crowd a poor girl exposed but heroic swore
with a quavering voice to a document proved an _alibi_ supplied a link
In this picture she bravely took her place It was the 23rd

Then cant you get it this morningor some time today

She considered still holding him with her look which she then turned on
her two companions who were by this time unreservedly enlisted She
didnt carenot a scrap and she glanced about for a piece of paper
With this she had to recognise the rigour of official thrifta morsel of
blackened blotter was the only loose paper to be seen Have you got a
card she said to her visitor He was quite away from Paddington now
and the next instant pocketbook in hand he had whipped a card out She
gave no glance at the name on itonly turned it to the other side She
continued to hold him she felt at present as she had never held him
and her command of her colleagues was for the moment not less marked She
wrote something on the back of the card and pushed it across to him

He fairly glared at it Seven nine four

Nine six oneshe obligingly completed the number Is it right
she smiled

He took the whole thing in with a flushed intensity then there broke out
in him a visibility of relief that was simply a tremendous exposure He
shone at them all like a tall lighthouse embracing even for sympathy
the blinking young men By all the powersits _wrong_ And without
another look without a word of thanks without time for anything or
anybody he turned on them the broad back of his great stature
straightened his triumphant shoulders and strode out of the place

She was left confronted with her habitual critics If its wrong its
all right she extravagantly quoted to them

The counterclerk was really awestricken But how did you know dear

I remembered love

Mr Buckton on the contrary was rude And what game is that miss

No happiness she had ever known came within miles of it and some minutes
elapsed before she could recall herself sufficiently to reply that it was
none of his business




CHAPTER XXIV


If life at Cockers with the dreadful drop of August had lost something
of its savour she had not been slow to infer that a heavier blight had
fallen on the graceful industry of Mrs Jordan

With Lord Rye and Lady Ventnor and Mrs Bubb all out of town with the
blinds down on all the homes of luxury this ingenious woman might well
have found her wonderful taste left quite on her hands She bore up
however in a way that began by exciting much of her young friends
esteem they perhaps even more frequently met as the wine of life flowed
less free from other sources and each in the lack of better diversion
carried on with more mystification for the other an intercourse that
consisted not a little in peeping out and drawing back Each waited for
the other to commit herself each profusely curtained for the other the
limits of low horizons Mrs Jordan was indeed probably the more
reckless skirmisher nothing could exceed her frequent incoherence unless
it was indeed her occasional bursts of confidence Her account of her
private affairs rose and fell like a flame in the windsometimes the
bravest bonfire and sometimes a handful of ashes This our young woman
took to be an effect of the position at one moment and another of the
famous door of the great world She had been struck in one of her
hapenny volumes with the translation of a French proverb according to
which such a door any door had to be either open or shut and it seemed
part of the precariousness of Mrs Jordans life that hers mostly managed
to be neither There had been occasions when it appeared to gape
widefairly to woo her across its threshold there had been others of
an order distinctly disconcerting when it was all but banged in her
face On the whole however she had evidently not lost heart these
still belonged to the class of things in spite of which she looked well
She intimated that the profits of her trade had swollen so as to float
her through any state of the tide and she had besides this a hundred
profundities and explanations

She rose superior above all on the happy fact that there were always
gentlemen in town and that gentlemen were her greatest admirers
gentlemen from the City in especialas to whom she was full of
information about the passion and pride excited in such breasts by the
elements of her charming commerce The City men did in short go in for
flowers There was a certain type of awfully smart stockbrokerLord Rye
called them Jews and bounders but she didnt carewhose extravagance
she more than once threw out had really if one had any conscience to
be forcibly restrained It was not perhaps a pure love of beauty it was
a matter of vanity and a sign of business they wished to crush their
rivals and that was one of their weapons Mrs Jordans shrewdness was
extreme she knew in any case her customershe dealt as she said with
all sorts and it was at the worst a race for hera race even in the
dull monthsfrom one set of chambers to another And then after all
there were also still the ladies the ladies of stockbroking circles were
perpetually up and down They were not quite perhaps Mrs Bubb or Lady
Ventnor but you couldnt tell the difference unless you quarrelled with
them and then you knew it only by their makingup sooner These ladies
formed the branch of her subject on which she most swayed in the breeze
to that degree that her confidant had ended with an inference or two
tending to banish regret for opportunities not embraced There were
indeed teagowns that Mrs Jordan describedbut teagowns were not the
whole of respectability and it was odd that a clergymans widow should
sometimes speak as if she almost thought so She came back it was true
unfailingly to Lord Rye never evidently quite losing sight of him even
on the longest excursions That he was kindness itself had become in
fact the very moral it all pointedpointed in strange flashes of the
poor womans nearsighted eyes She launched at her young friend
portentous looks solemn heralds of some extraordinary communication The
communication itself from week to week hung fire but it was to the
facts over which it hovered that she owed her power of going on They
are in one way and another she often emphasised a tower of
strength and as the allusion was to the aristocracy the girl could
quite wonder why if they were so in one way they should require to be
so in two She thoroughly knew however how many ways Mrs Jordan
counted in It all meant simply that her fate was pressing her close If
that fate was to be sealed at the matrimonial altar it was perhaps not
remarkable that she shouldnt come all at once to the scratch of
overwhelming a mere telegraphist It would necessarily present to such a
person a prospect of regretful sacrifice Lord Ryeif it _was_ Lord
Ryewouldnt be kind to a nonentity of that sort even though people
quite as good had been

One Sunday afternoon in November they went by arrangement to church
together after whichon the inspiration of the moment the arrangement
had not included itthey proceeded to Mrs Jordans lodging in the
region of Maida Vale She had raved to her friend about her service of
predilection she was excessively high and had more than once wished
to introduce the girl to the same comfort and privilege There was a
thick brown fog and Maida Vale tasted of acrid smoke but they had been
sitting among chants and incense and wonderful music during which
though the effect of such things on her mind was great our young lady
had indulged in a series of reflexions but indirectly related to them
One of these was the result of Mrs Jordans having said to her on the
way and with a certain fine significance that Lord Rye had been for
some time in town She had spoken as if it were a circumstance to which
little required to be addedas if the bearing of such an item on her
life might easily be grasped Perhaps it was the wonder of whether Lord
Rye wished to marry her that made her guest with thoughts straying to
that quarter quite determine that some other nuptials also should take
place at Saint Julians Mr Mudge was still an attendant at his
Wesleyan chapel but this was the least of her worriesit had never even
vexed her enough for her to so much as name it to Mrs Jordan Mr
Mudges form of worship was one of several thingsthey made up in
superiority and beauty for what they wanted in numberthat she had long
ago settled he should take from her and she had now moreover for the
first time definitely established her own Its principal feature was
that it was to be the same as that of Mrs Jordan and Lord Rye which was
indeed very much what she said to her hostess as they sat together later
on The brown fog was in this hostesss little parlour where it acted
as a postponement of the question of there being besides anything else
than the teacups and a pewter pot and a very black little fire and a
paraffin lamp without a shade There was at any rate no sign of a
flower it was not for herself Mrs Jordan gathered sweets The girl
waited till they had had a cup of teawaited for the announcement that
she fairly believed her friend had this time possessed herself of her
formally at last to make but nothing came after the interval save a
little poke at the fire which was like the clearing of a throat for a
speech




CHAPTER XXV


I think you must have heard me speak of Mr Drake Mrs Jordan had
never looked so queer nor her smile so suggestive of a large benevolent
bite

Mr Drake Oh yes isnt he a friend of Lord Rye

A great and trusted friend AlmostI may saya loved friend

Mrs Jordans almost had such an oddity that her companion was moved
rather flippantly perhaps to take it up Dont people as good as love
their friends when they I trust them

It pulled up a little the eulogist of Mr Drake Well my dear I love
_you_

But you dont trust me the girl unmercifully asked

Again Mrs Jordan pausedstill she looked queer Yes she replied
with a certain austerity thats exactly what Im about to give you
rather a remarkable proof of The sense of its being remarkable was
already so strong that while she bridled a little this held her auditor
in a momentary muteness of submission Mr Drake has rendered his
lordship for several years services that his lordship has highly
appreciated and that make it all the moreaunexpected that they
should perhaps a little suddenly separate

Separate Our young lady was mystified but she tried to be
interested and she already saw that she had put the saddle on the wrong
horse She had heard something of Mr Drake who was a member of his
lordships circlethe member with whom apparently Mrs Jordans
avocations had most happened to throw her She was only a little puzzled
at the separation Well at any rate she smiled if they separate
as friends

Oh his lordship takes the greatest interest in Mr Drakes future Hell
do anything for him he has in fact just done a great deal There
_must_ you know be changes

No one knows it better than I the girl said She wished to draw her
interlocutress out There will be changes enough for me

Youre leaving Cockers

The ornament of that establishment waited a moment to answer and then it
was indirect Tell me what _youre_ doing

Well what will you think of it

Why that youve found the opening you were always so sure of

Mrs Jordan on this appeared to muse with embarrassed intensity I
was always sure yesand yet I often wasnt

Well I hope youre sure now Sure I mean of Mr Drake

Yes my dear I think I may say I _am_ I kept him going till I was

Then hes yours

My very own

How nice And awfully rich our young woman went on

Mrs Jordan showed promptly enough that she loved for higher things
Awfully handsomesix foot two And he _has_ put by

Quite like Mr Mudge then that gentlemans friend rather desperately
exclaimed

Oh not quite Mr Drakes was ambiguous about it but the name of Mr
Mudge had evidently given her some sort of stimulus Hell have more
opportunity now at any rate Hes going to Lady Bradeen

To Lady Bradeen This was bewilderment Going

The girl had seen from the way Mrs Jordan looked at her that the
effect of the name had been to make her let something out Do you know
her

She floundered but she found her feet Well youll remember Ive
often told you that if youve grand clients I have them too

Yes said Mrs Jordan but the great difference is that you hate
yours whereas I really love mine _Do_ you know Lady Bradeen she
pursued

Down to the ground Shes always in and out

Mrs Jordans foolish eyes confessed in fixing themselves on this
sketch to a degree of wonder and even of envy But she bore up and
with a certain gaiety Do you hate _her_ she demanded

Her visitors reply was prompt Dear nonot nearly so much as some of
them Shes too outrageously beautiful

Mrs Jordan continued to gaze Outrageously

Well yes deliciously What was really delicious was Mrs Jordans
vagueness You dont know heryouve not seen her her guest lightly
continued

No but Ive heard a great deal about her

So have I our young lady exclaimed

Jordan looked an instant as if she suspected her good faith or at least
her seriousness You know some friend

Of Lady Bradeens Oh yesI know one

Only one

The girl laughed out Only onebut hes so intimate

Mrs Jordan just hesitated Hes a gentleman

Yes hes not a lady

Her interlocutress appeared to muse Shes immensely surrounded

She _will_ bewith Mr Drake

Mrs Jordans gaze became strangely fixed Is she _very_ goodlooking

The handsomest person I know

Mrs Jordan continued to brood Well I know some beauties Then with
her odd jerkiness Do you think she looks _good_

Because thats not always the case with the goodlookingthe other
took it up No indeed it isnt thats one thing Cockers has taught
me Still there are some people who have everything Lady Bradeen at
any rate has enough eyes and a nose and a mouth a complexion a
figure

A figure Mrs Jordan almost broke in

A figure a head of hair The girl made a little conscious motion that
seemed to let the hair all down and her companion watched the wonderful
show But Mr Drake _is_ another

AnotherMrs Jordans thoughts had to come back from a distance

Of her ladyships admirers Hes going you say to her

At this Mrs Jordan really faltered She has engaged him

Engaged himour young woman was quite at sea

In the same capacity as Lord Rye

And was Lord Rye engaged




CHAPTER XXVI


Mrs Jordan looked away from her nowlooked she thought rather injured
and as if trifled with even a little angry The mention of Lady
Bradeen had frustrated for a while the convergence of our heroines
thoughts but with this impression of her old friends combined
impatience and diffidence they began again to whirl round her and
continued it till one of them appeared to dart at her out of the dance
as if with a sharp peck It came to her with a lively shock with a
positive sting that Mr Drake wascould it be possible With the idea
she found herself afresh on the edge of laughter of a sudden and strange
perversity of mirth Mr Drake loomed in a swift image before her
such a figure as she had seen in open doorways of houses in Cockers
quartermajestic middleaged erect flanked on either side by a
footman and taking the name of a visitor Mr Drake then verily _was_ a
person who opened the door Before she had time however to recover
from the effect of her evocation she was offered a vision which quite
engulfed it It was communicated to her somehow that the face with which
she had seen it rise prompted Mrs Jordan to dash a bit wildly at
something at anything that might attenuate criticism Lady Bradeens
rearrangingshes going to be married

Married The girl echoed it ever so softly but there it was at last

Didnt you know it

She summoned all her sturdiness No she hasnt told me

And her friendshavent they

I havent seen any of them lately Im not so fortunate as you

Mrs Jordan gathered herself Then you havent even heard of Lord
Bradeens death

Her comrade unable for a moment to speak gave a slow headshake You
know it from Mr Drake It was better surely not to learn things at all
than to learn them by the butler

She tells him everything

And he tells _you_I see Our young lady got up recovering her muff
and her gloves she smiled Well I havent unfortunately any Mr Drake
I congratulate you with all my heart Even without your sort of
assistance however theres a trifle here and there that I do pick up I
gather that if shes to marry any one it must quite necessarily be my
friend

Mrs Jordan was now also on her feet Is Captain Everard your friend

The girl considered drawing on a glove I saw at one time an immense
deal of him

Mrs Jordan looked hard at the glove but she hadnt after all waited for
that to be sorry it wasnt cleaner What time was that

It must have been the time you were seeing so much of Mr Drake She
had now fairly taken it in the distinguished person Mrs Jordan was to
marry would answer bells and put on coals and superintend at least the
cleaning of boots for the other distinguished person whom she mightwell
whom she might have had if she had wished so much more to say to Good
bye she added goodbye

Mrs Jordan however again taking her muff from her turned it over
brushed it off and thoughtfully peeped into it Tell me this before you
go You spoke just now of your own changes Do you mean that Mr
Mudge

Mr Mudge has had great patience with mehe has brought me at last to
the point Were to be married next month and have a nice little home
But hes only a grocer you knowthe girl met her friends intent
eyesso that Im afraid that with the set youve got into you wont
see your way to keep up our friendship

Mrs Jordan for a moment made no answer to this she only held the muff
up to her face after which she gave it back You dont like it I
see I see

To her guests astonishment there were tears now in her eyes I dont
like what the girl asked

Why my engagement Only with your great cleverness the poor lady
quavered out you put it in your own way I mean that youll cool off
You already have And on this the next instant her tears began to
flow She succumbed to them and collapsed she sank down again burying
her face and trying to smother her sobs

Her young friend stood there still in some rigour but taken much by
surprise even if not yet fully moved to pity I dont put anything in
any way and Im very glad youre suited Only you know you did put
to me so splendidly what even for me if I had listened to you it might
lead to

Mrs Jordan kept up a mild thin weak wail then drying her eyes as
feebly considered this reminder It has led to my not starving she
faintly gasped

Our young lady at this dropped into the place beside her and now in a
rush the small silly misery was clear She took her hand as a sign of
pitying it then after another instant confirmed this expression with a
consoling kiss They sat there together they looked out hand in hand
into the damp dusky shabby little room and into the future of no such
very different suggestion at last accepted by each There was no
definite utterance on either side of Mr Drakes position in the great
world but the temporary collapse of his prospective bride threw all
further necessary light and what our heroine saw and felt for in the
whole business was the vivid reflexion of her own dreams and delusions
and her own return to reality Reality for the poor things they both
were could only be ugliness and obscurity could never be the escape
the rise She pressed her friendshe had tact enough for thatwith no
other personal question brought on no need of further revelations only
just continued to hold and comfort her and to acknowledge by stiff little
forbearances the common element in their fate She felt indeed
magnanimous in such matters since if it was very well for condolence or
reassurance to suppress just then invidious shrinkings she yet by no
means saw herself sitting down as she might say to the same table with
Mr Drake There would luckily to all appearance be little question of
tables and the circumstance that on their peculiar lines her friends
interests would still attach themselves to Mayfair flung over Chalk Farm
the first radiance it had shown Where was ones pride and ones passion
when the real way to judge of ones luck was by making not the wrong but
the right comparison Before she had again gathered herself to go she
felt very small and cautious and thankful We shall have our own
house she said and you must come very soon and let me show it you

_We_ shall have our own too Mrs Jordan replied for dont you know
he makes it a condition that he sleeps out

A conditionthe girl felt out of it

For any new position It was on that he parted with Lord Rye His
lordship cant meet it So Mr Drake has given him up

And all for youour young woman put it as cheerfully as possible

For me and Lady Bradeen Her ladyships too glad to get him at any
price Lord Rye out of interest in us has in fact quite _made_ her
take him So as I tell you he will have his own establishment

Mrs Jordan in the elation of it had begun to revive but there was
nevertheless between them rather a conscious pausea pause in which
neither visitor nor hostess brought out a hope or an invitation It
expressed in the last resort that in spite of submission and sympathy
they could now after all only look at each other across the social gulf
They remained together as if it would be indeed their last chance still
sitting though awkwardly quite close and feeling alsoand this most
unmistakeablythat there was one thing more to go into By the time it
came to the surface moreover our young friend had recognised the whole
of the main truth from which she even drew again a slight irritation It
was not the main truth perhaps that most signified but after her
momentary effort her embarrassment and her tears Mrs Jordan had begun
to sound afreshand even without speakingthe note of a social
connexion She hadnt really let go of it that she was marrying into
society Well it was a harmless compensation and it was all the
prospective bride of Mr Mudge had to leave with her




CHAPTER XXVII


This young lady at last rose again but she lingered before going And
has Captain Everard nothing to say to it

To what dear

Why to such questionsthe domestic arrangements things in the house

How can he with any authority when nothing in the house is his

Not his The girl wondered perfectly conscious of the appearance she
thus conferred on Mrs Jordan of knowing in comparison with herself so
tremendously much about it Well there were things she wanted so to get
at that she was willing at last though it hurt her to pay for them with
humiliation Why are they not his

Dont you know dear that he has nothing

Nothing It was hard to see him in such a light but Mrs Jordans
power to answer for it had a superiority that began on the spot to
grow Isnt he rich

Mrs Jordan looked immensely looked both generally and particularly
informed It depends upon what you call Not at any rate in the
least as she is What does he bring Think what she has And then
love his debts

His debts His young friend was fairly betrayed into helpless
innocence She could struggle a little but she had to let herself go
and if she had spoken frankly she would have said Do tell me for I
dont know so much about him as _that_ As she didnt speak frankly she
only said His debts are nothingwhen she so adores him

Mrs Jordan began to fix her again and now she saw that she must only
take it all That was what it had come to his having sat with her there
on the bench and under the trees in the summer darkness and put his hand
on her making her know what he would have said if permitted his having
returned to her afterwards repeatedly with supplicating eyes and a
fever in his blood and her having on her side hard and pedantic
helped by some miracle and with her impossible condition only answered
him yet supplicating back through the bars of the cageall simply
that she might hear of him now for ever lost only through Mrs Jordan
who touched him through Mr Drake who reached him through Lady Bradeen
She adores himbut of course that wasnt all there was about it

The girl met her eyes a minute then quite surrendered What was there
else about it

Why dont you knowMrs Jordan was almost compassionate

Her interlocutress had in the cage sounded depths but there was a
suggestion here somehow of an abyss quite measureless Of course I know
she would never let him alone

How _could_ shefancywhen he had so compromised her

The most artless cry they had ever uttered broke at this from the
younger pair of lips _Had_ he so

Why dont you know the scandal

Our heroine thought recollected there was something whatever it was
that she knew after all much more of than Mrs Jordan She saw him again
as she had seen him come that morning to recover the telegramshe saw
him as she had seen him leave the shop She perched herself a moment on
this Oh there was nothing public

Not exactly publicno But there was an awful scare and an awful row
It was all on the very point of coming out Something was lostsomething
was found

Ah yes the girl replied smiling as if with the revival of a blurred
memory something was found

It all got aboutand there was a point at which Lord Bradeen had to
act

Had toyes But he didnt

Mrs Jordan was obliged to admit it No he didnt And then luckily
for them he died

I didnt know about his death her companion said

It was nine weeks ago and most sudden It has given them a prompt
chance

To get marriedthis was a wonderwithin nine weeks

Oh not immediately butin all the circumstancesvery quietly and I
assure you very soon Every preparations made Above all she holds
him

Oh yes she holds him our young friend threw off She had this before
her again a minute then she continued You mean through his having made
her talked about

Yes but not only that She has still another pull

Another

Mrs Jordan hesitated Why he was _in_ something

Her comrade wondered In what

I dont know Something bad As I tell you something was found

The girl stared Well

It would have been very bad for him But she helped him some wayshe
recovered it got hold of it Its even said she stole it

Our young woman considered afresh Why it was what was found that
precisely saved him

Mrs Jordan however was positive I beg your pardon I happen to
know

Her disciple faltered but an instant Do you mean through Mr Drake Do
they tell him these things

A good servant said Mrs Jordan now thoroughly superior and
proportionately sententious doesnt need to be told Her ladyship
savedas a woman so often savesthe man she loves

This time our heroine took longer to recover herself but she found a
voice at last Ah wellof course I dont know The great thing was
that he got off They seem then in a manner she added to have done
a great deal for each other

Well its she that has done most She has him tight

I see I see Goodbye The women had already embraced and this was
not repeated but Mrs Jordan went down with her guest to the door of the
house Here again the younger lingered reverting though three or four
other remarks had on the way passed between them to Captain Everard and
Lady Bradeen Did you mean just now that if she hadnt saved him as
you call it she wouldnt hold him so tight

Well I dare say Mrs Jordan on the doorstep smiled with a
reflexion that had come to her she took one of her big bites of the
brown gloom Men always dislike one when theyve done one an injury

But what injury had he done her

The one Ive mentioned He _must_ marry her you know

And didnt he want to

Not before

Not before she recovered the telegram

Mrs Jordan was pulled up a little Was it a telegram

The girl hesitated I thought you said so I mean whatever it was

Yes whatever it was I dont think she saw _that_

So she just nailed him

She just nailed him The departing friend was now at the bottom of the
little flight of steps the other was at the top with a certain
thickness of fog And when am I to think of you in your little
homenext month asked the voice from the top

At the very latest And when am I to think of you in yours

Oh even sooner I feel after so much talk with you about it as if I
were already there Then _Good_bye came out of the fog

Good_bye_ went into it Our young lady went into it also in the
opposed quarter and presently after a few sightless turns came out on
the Paddington canal Distinguishing vaguely what the low parapet
enclosed she stopped close to it and stood a while very intently but
perhaps still sightlessly looking down on it A policeman while she
remained strolled past her then going his way a little further and
half lost in the atmosphere paused and watched her But she was quite
unawareshe was full of her thoughts They were too numerous to find a
place just here but two of the number may at least be mentioned One of
these was that decidedly her little home must be not for next month
but for next week the other which came indeed as she resumed her walk
and went her way was that it was strange such a matter should be at last
settled for her by Mr Drake
