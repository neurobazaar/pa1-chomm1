AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE

ACT I

SCENEDR STOCKMANNS sittingroom It is evening The room is
plainly but neatly appointed and furnished In the righthand wall are
two doors the farther leads out to the hall the nearer to the
doctors study In the lefthand wall opposite the door leading to the
hall is a door leading to the other rooms occupied by the family In
the middle of the same wall stands the stove and further forward a
couch with a lookingglass hanging over it and an oval table in front
of it On the table a lighted lamp with a lampshade At the back of
the room an open door leads to the diningroom BILLING is seen
sitting at the dining table on which a lamp is burning He has a
napkin tucked under his chin and MRS STOCKMANN is standing by the
table handing him a large platefull of roast beef The other places at
the table are empty and the table somewhat in disorder evidently a
meal having recently been finished

Mrs Stockmann You see if you come an hour late Mr Billing you
have to put up with cold meat

Billing as he eats It is uncommonly good thank youremarkably good

Mrs Stockmann My husband makes such a point of having his meals
punctually you know

Billing That doesnt affect me a bit Indeed I almost think I enjoy a
meal all the better when I can sit down and eat all by myself and
undisturbed

Mrs Stockmann Oh well as long as you are enjoying it Turns to
the hall door listening I expect that is Mr Hovstad coming too

Billing Very likely

PETER STOCKMANN comes in He wears an overcoat and his official hat
and carries a stick

Peter Stockmann Good evening Katherine

Mrs Stockmann coming forward into the sittingroom Ah good
eveningis it you How good of you to come up and see us

Peter Stockmann I happened to be passing and solooks into the
diningroom But you have company with you I see

Mrs Stockmann a little embarrassed Oh noit was quite by chance
he came in Hurriedly Wont you come in and have something too

Peter Stockmann I No thank you Good gracioushot meat at night
Not with my digestion

Mrs Stockmann Oh but just once in a way

Peter Stockmann No no my dear lady I stick to my tea and bread and
butter It is much more wholesome in the long runand a little more
economical too

Mrs Stockmann smiling Now you mustnt think that Thomas and I are
spendthrifts

Peter Stockmann Not you my dear I would never think that of you
Points to the Doctors study Is he not at home

Mrs Stockmann No he went out for a little turn after supperhe and
the boys

Peter Stockmann I doubt if that is a wise thing to do Listens I
fancy I hear him coming now

Mrs Stockmann No I dont think it is he A knock is heard at the
door Come in HOVSTAD comes in from the hall Oh it is you Mr
Hovstad

Hovstad Yes I hope you will forgive me but I was delayed at the
printers Good evening Mr Mayor

Peter Stockmann bowing a little distantly Good evening You have
come on business no doubt

Hovstad Partly Its about an article for the paper

Peter Stockmann So I imagined I hear my brother has become a prolific
contributor to the Peoples Messenger

Hovstad Yes he is good enough to write in the Peoples Messenger
when he has any home truths to tell

Mrs Stockmann to HOVSTAD But wont you Points to the
diningroom

Peter Stockmann Quite so quite so I dont blame him in the least as
a writer for addressing himself to the quarters where he will find the
readiest sympathy And besides that I personally have no reason to
bear any ill will to your paper Mr Hovstad

Hovstad I quite agree with you

Peter Stockmann Taking one thing with another there is an excellent
spirit of toleration in the townan admirable municipal spirit And it
all springs from the fact of our having a great common interest to
unite usan interest that is in an equally high degree the concern of
every rightminded citizen

Hovstad The Baths yes

Peter Stockmann Exactlyour fine new handsome Baths Mark my
words Mr Hovstadthe Baths will become the focus of our municipal
life Not a doubt of it

Mrs Stockmann That is just what Thomas says

Peter Stockmann Think how extraordinarily the place has developed
within the last year or two Money has been flowing in and there is
some life and some business doing in the town Houses and landed
property are rising in value every day

Hovstad And unemployment is diminishing

Peter Stockmann Yes that is another thing The burden on the poor
rates has been lightened to the great relief of the propertied
classes and that relief will be even greater if only we get a really
good summer this year and lots of visitorsplenty of invalids who
will make the Baths talked about

Hovstad And there is a good prospect of that I hear

Peter Stockmann It looks very promising Inquiries about apartments
and that sort of thing are reaching us every day

Hovstad Well the doctors article will come in very suitably

Peter Stockmann Has he been writing something just lately

Hovstad This is something he wrote in the winter a recommendation of
the Bathsan account of the excellent sanitary conditions here But I
held the article over temporarily

Peter Stockmann Ahsome little difficulty about it I suppose

Hovstad No not at all I thought it would be better to wait until the
spring because it is just at this time that people begin to think
seriously about their summer quarters

Peter Stockmann Quite right you were perfectly right Mr Hovstad

Hovstad Yes Thomas is really indefatigable when it is a question of
the Baths

Peter Stockmann Well remember he is the Medical Officer to the Baths

Hovstad Yes and what is more they owe their existence to him

Peter Stockmann To him Indeed It is true I have heard from time to
time that some people are of that opinion At the same time I must say
I imagined that I took a modest part in the enterprise

Mrs Stockmann Yes that is what Thomas is always saying

Hovstad But who denies it Mr Stockmann You set the thing going and
made a practical concern of it we all know that I only meant that the
idea of it came first from the doctor

Peter Stockmann Oh ideas yes My brother has had plenty of them in
his timeunfortunately But when it is a question of putting an idea
into practical shape you have to apply to a man of different mettle
Mr Hovstad And I certainly should have thought that in this house at
least

Mrs Stockmann My dear Peter

Hovstad How can you think that

Mrs Stockmann Wont you go in and have something Mr Hovstad My
husband is sure to be back directly

Hovstad Thank you perhaps just a morsel Goes into the diningroom

Peter Stockmann lowering his voice a little It is a curious thing
that these farmers sons never seem to lose their want of tact

Mrs Stockmann Surely it is not worth bothering about Cannot you and
Thomas share the credit as brothers

Peter Stockmann I should have thought so but apparently some people
are not satisfied with a share

Mrs Stockmann What nonsense You and Thomas get on so capitally
together Listens There he is at last I think Goes out and opens
the door leading to the hall

Dr Stockmann laughing and talking outside Look herehere is
another guest for you Katherine Isnt that jolly Come in Captain
Horster hang your coat up on this peg Ah you dont wear an overcoat
Just think Katherine I met him in the street and could hardly
persuade him to come up CAPTAIN HORSTER comes into the room and
greets MRS STOCKMANN He is followed by DR STOCKMANN Come along in
boys They are ravenously hungry again you know Come along Captain
Horster you must have a slice of beef Pushes HORSTER into the
diningroom EJLIF and MORTEN go in after them

Mrs Stockmann But Thomas dont you see

Dr Stockmann turning in the doorway Oh is it you Peter Shakes
hands with him Now that is very delightful

Peter Stockmann Unfortunately I must go in a moment

Dr Stockmann Rubbish There is some toddy just coming in You havent
forgotten the toddy Katherine

Mrs Stockmann Of course not the water is boiling now Goes into the
diningroom

Peter Stockmann Toddy too

Dr Stockmann Yes sit down and we will have it comfortably

Peter Stockmann Thanks I never care about an evenings drinking

Dr Stockmann But this isnt an evenings drinking

Peter Stockmann It seems to me Looks towards the diningroom It
is extraordinary how they can put away all that food

Dr Stockmann rubbing his hands Yes isnt it splendid to see young
people eat They have always got an appetite you know Thats as it
should be Lots of foodto build up their strength They are the
people who are going to stir up the fermenting forces of the future
Peter

Peter Stockmann May I ask what they will find here to stir up as
you put it

Dr Stockmann Ah you must ask the young people thatwhen the times
comes We shant be able to see it of course That stands to
reasontwo old fogies like us

Peter Stockmann Really really I must say that is an extremely odd
expression to

Dr Stockmann Oh you mustnt take me too literally Peter I am so
heartily happy and contented you know I think it is such an
extraordinary piece of good fortune to be in the middle of all this
growing germinating life It is a splendid time to live in It is as
if a whole new world were being created around one

Peter Stockmann Do you really think so

Dr Stockmann Ah naturally you cant appreciate it as keenly as I
You have lived all your life in these surroundings and your
impressions have been blunted But I who have been buried all these
years in my little corner up north almost without ever seeing a
stranger who might bring new ideas with himwell in my case it has
just the same effect as if I had been transported into the middle of a
crowded city

Peter Stockmann Oh a city

Dr Stockmann I know I know it is all cramped enough here compared
with many other places But there is life herethere is promisethere
are innumerable things to work for and fight for and that is the main
thing Calls Katherine hasnt the postman been here

Mrs Stockmann from the diningroom No

Dr Stockmann And then to be comfortably off Peter That is something
one learns to value when one has been on the brink of starvation as
we have

Peter Stockmann Oh surely

Dr Stockmann Indeed I can assure you we have often been very hard put
to it up there And now to be able to live like a lord Today for
instance we had roast beef for dinnerand what is more for supper
too Wont you come and have a little bit Or let me show it you at
any rate Come here

Peter Stockmann No nonot for worlds

Dr Stockmann Well but just come here then Do you see we have got a
tablecover

Peter Stockmann Yes I noticed it

Dr Stockmann And we have got a lampshade too Do you see All out of
Katherines savings It makes the room so cosy Dont you think so
Just stand here for a momentno no not therejust here thats it
Look now when you get the light on it altogether I really think it
looks very nice doesnt it

Peter Stockmann Oh if you can afford luxuries of this kind

Dr Stockmann Yes I can afford it now Katherine tells me I earn
almost as much as we spend

Peter Stockmann Almostyes

Dr Stockmann But a scientific man must live in a little bit of style
I am quite sure an ordinary civil servant spends more in a year than I
do

Peter Stockmann I daresay A civil servanta man in a wellpaid
position

Dr Stockmann Well any ordinary merchant then A man in that
position spends two or three times as much as

Peter Stockmann It just depends on circumstances

Dr Stockmann At all events I assure you I dont waste money
unprofitably But I cant find it in my heart to deny myself the
pleasure of entertaining my friends I need that sort of thing you
know I have lived for so long shut out of it all that it is a
necessity of life to me to mix with young eager ambitious men men of
liberal and active minds and that describes every one of those fellows
who are enjoying their supper in there I wish you knew more of Hovstad

Peter Stockmann By the way Hovstad was telling me he was going to
print another article of yours

Dr Stockmann An article of mine

Peter Stockmann Yes about the Baths An article you wrote in the
winter

Dr Stockmann Oh that one No I dont intend that to appear just for
the present

Peter Stockmann Why not It seems to me that this would be the most
opportune moment

Dr Stockmann Yes very likelyunder normal conditions Crosses the
room

Peter Stockmann following him with his eyes Is there anything
abnormal about the present conditions

Dr Stockmann standing still To tell you the truth Peter I cant
say just at this momentat all events not tonight There may be much
that is very abnormal about the present conditionsand it is possible
there may be nothing abnormal about them at all It is quite possible
it may be merely my imagination

Peter Stockmann I must say it all sounds most mysterious Is there
something going on that I am to be kept in ignorance of I should have
imagined that I as Chairman of the governing body of the Baths

Dr Stockmann And I should have imagined that I Oh come dont let
us fly out at one another Peter

Peter Stockmann Heaven forbid I am not in the habit of flying out at
people as you call it But I am entitled to request most emphatically
that all arrangements shall be made in a businesslike manner through
the proper channels and shall be dealt with by the legally constituted
authorities I can allow no going behind our backs by any roundabout
means

Dr Stockmann Have I ever at any time tried to go behind your backs

Peter Stockmann You have an ingrained tendency to take your own way
at all events and that is almost equally inadmissible in a well
ordered community The individual ought undoubtedly to acquiesce in
subordinating himself to the communityor to speak more accurately
to the authorities who have the care of the communitys welfare

Dr Stockmann Very likely But what the deuce has all this got to do
with me

Peter Stockmann That is exactly what you never appear to be willing to
learn my dear Thomas But mark my words some day you will have to
suffer for itsooner or later Now I have told you Goodbye

Dr Stockmann Have you taken leave of your senses You are on the
wrong scent altogether

Peter Stockmann I am not usually that You must excuse me now if I
calls into the diningroom Good night Katherine Good night
gentlemen Goes out

Mrs Stockmann coming from the diningroom Has he gone

Dr Stockmann Yes and in such a bad temper

Mrs Stockmann But dear Thomas what have you been doing to him again

Dr Stockmann Nothing at all And anyhow he cant oblige me to make
my report before the proper time

Mrs Stockmann What have you got to make a report to him about

Dr Stockmann Hm Leave that to me Katherine It is an extraordinary
thing that the postman doesnt come

HOVSTAD BILLING and HORSTER have got up from the table and come into
the sittingroom EJLIF and MORTEN come in after them

Billing stretching himself Ahone feels a new man after a meal
like that

Hovstad The mayor wasnt in a very sweet temper tonight then

Dr Stockmann It is his stomach he has wretched digestion

Hovstad I rather think it was us two of the Peoples Messenger that
he couldnt digest

Mrs Stockmann I thought you came out of it pretty well with him

Hovstad Oh yes but it isnt anything more than a sort of truce

Billing That is just what it is That word sums up the situation

Dr Stockmann We must remember that Peter is a lonely man poor chap
He has no home comforts of any kind nothing but everlasting business
And all that infernal weak tea wash that he pours into himself Now
then my boys bring chairs up to the table Arent we going to have
that toddy Katherine

Mrs Stockmann going into the diningroom I am just getting it

Dr Stockmann Sit down here on the couch beside me Captain Horster
We so seldom see you Please sit down my friends They sit down at
the table MRS STOCKMANN brings a tray with a spiritlamp glasses
bottles etc upon it

Mrs Stockmann There you are This is arrack and this is rum and
this one is the brandy Now every one must help themselves

Dr Stockmann taking a glass We will They all mix themselves some
toddy And let us have the cigars Ejlif you know where the box is
And you Morten can fetch my pipe The two boys go into the room on
the right I have a suspicion that Ejlif pockets a cigar now and
thenbut I take no notice of it Calls out And my smokingcap too
Morten Katherine you can tell him where I left it Ah he has got it
The boys bring the various things Now my friends I stick to my
pipe you know This one has seen plenty of bad weather with me up
north Touches glasses with them Your good health Ah it is good to
be sitting snug and warm here

Mrs Stockmann who sits knitting Do you sail soon Captain Horster

Horster I expect to be ready to sail next week

Mrs Stockmann I suppose you are going to America

Horster Yes that is the plan

Mrs Stockmann Then you wont be able to take part in the coming
election

Horster Is there going to be an election

Billing Didnt you know

Horster No I dont mix myself up with those things

Billing But do you not take an interest in public affairs

Horster No I dont know anything about politics

Billing All the same one ought to vote at any rate

Horster Even if one doesnt know anything about what is going on

Billing Doesnt know What do you mean by that A community is like a
ship everyone ought to be prepared to take the helm

Horster Maybe that is all very well on shore but on board ship it
wouldnt work

Hovstad It is astonishing how little most sailors care about what goes
on on shore

Billing Very extraordinary

Dr Stockmann Sailors are like birds of passage they feel equally at
home in any latitude And that is only an additional reason for our
being all the more keen Hovstad Is there to be anything of public
interest in tomorrows Messenger

Hovstad Nothing about municipal affairs But the day after tomorrow I
was thinking of printing your article

Dr Stockmann Ah devil take itmy article Look here that must wait
a bit

Hovstad Really We had just got convenient space for it and I thought
it was just the opportune moment

Dr Stockmann Yes yes very likely you are right but it must wait
all the same I will explain to you later PETRA comes in from the
hall in hat and cloak and with a bundle of exercise books under her
arm

Petra Good evening

Dr Stockmann Good evening Petra come along

Mutual greetings PETRA takes off her things and puts them down on a
chair by the door

Petra And you have all been sitting here enjoying yourselves while I
have been out slaving

Dr Stockmann Well come and enjoy yourself too

Billing May I mix a glass for you

Petra coming to the table Thanks I would rather do it you always
mix it too strong But I forgot fatherI have a letter for you Goes
to the chair where she has laid her things

Dr Stockmann A letter From whom

Petra looking in her coat pocket The postman gave it to me just as I
was going out

Dr Stockmann getting up and going to her And you only give to me
now

Petra I really had not time to run up again There it is

Dr Stockmann seizing the letter Lets see lets see child Looks
at the address Yes thats all right

Mrs Stockmann Is it the one you have been expecting go anxiously
Thomas

Dr Stockmann Yes it is I must go to my room now and Where shall I
get a light Katherine Is there no lamp in my room again

Mrs Stockmann Yes your lamp is already lit on your desk

Dr Stockmann Good good Excuse me for a moment Goes into his
study

Petra What do you suppose it is mother

Mrs Stockmann I dont know for the last day or two he has always
been asking if the postman has not been

Billing Probably some country patient

Petra Poor old dadhe will overwork himself soon Mixes a glass for
herself There that will taste good

Hovstad Have you been teaching in the evening school again today

Petra sipping from her glass Two hours

Billing And four hours of school in the morning

Petra Five hours

Mrs Stockmann And you have still got exercises to correct I see

Petra A whole heap yes

Horster You are pretty full up with work too it seems to me

Petra Yesbut that is good One is so delightfully tired after it

Billing Do you like that

Petra Yes because one sleeps so well then

Morten You must be dreadfully wicked Petra

Petra Wicked

Morten Yes because you work so much Mr Rorlund says work is a
punishment for our sins

Ejlif Pooh what a duffer you are to believe a thing like that

Mrs Stockmann Come come Ejlif

Billing laughing Thats capital

Hovstad Dont you want to work as hard as that Morten

Morten No indeed I dont

Hovstad What do you want to be then

Morten I should like best to be a Viking

Ejlif You would have to be a pagan then

Morten Well I could become a pagan couldnt I

Billing I agree with you Morten My sentiments exactly

Mrs Stockmann signalling to him I am sure that is not true Mr
Billing

Billing Yes I swear it is I am a pagan and I am proud of it
Believe me before long we shall all be pagans

Morten And then shall be allowed to do anything we like

Billing Well youll see Morten

Mrs Stockmann You must go to your room now boys I am sure you have
some lessons to learn for tomorrow

Ejlif I should like so much to stay a little longer

Mrs Stockmann No no away you go both of you The boys say good
night and go into the room on the left

Hovstad Do you really think it can do the boys any harm to hear such
things

Mrs Stockmann I dont know but I dont like it

Petra But you know mother I think you really are wrong about it

Mrs Stockmann Maybe but I dont like itnot in our own home

Petra There is so much falsehood both at home and at school At home
one must not speak and at school we have to stand and tell lies to the
children

Horster Tell lies

Petra Yes dont you suppose we have to teach them all sorts of things
that we dont believe

Billing That is perfectly true

Petra If only I had the means I would start a school of my own and
it would be conducted on very different lines

Billing Oh bother the means

Horster Well if you are thinking of that Miss Stockmann I shall be
delighted to provide you with a schoolroom The great big old house my
father left me is standing almost empty there is an immense
diningroom downstairs

Petra laughing Thank you very much but I am afraid nothing will
come of it

Hovstad No Miss Petra is much more likely to take to journalism I
expect By the way have you had time to do anything with that English
story you promised to translate for us

Petra No not yet but you shall have it in good time

DR STOCKMANN comes in from his room with an open letter in his hand

Dr Stockmann waving the letter Well now the town will have
something new to talk about I can tell you

Billing Something new

Mrs Stockmann What is this

Dr Stockmann A great discovery Katherine

Hovstad Really

Mrs Stockmann A discovery of yours

Dr Stockmann A discovery of mine Walks up and down Just let them
come saying as usual that it is all fancy and a crazy mans
imagination But they will be careful what they say this time I can
tell you

Petra But father tell us what it is

Dr Stockmann Yes yesonly give me time and you shall know all
about it If only I had Peter here now It just shows how we men can go
about forming our judgments when in reality we are as blind as any
moles

Hovstad What are you driving at Doctor

Dr Stockmann standing still by the table Isnt it the universal
opinion that our town is a healthy spot

Hovstad Certainly

Dr Stockmann Quite an unusually healthy spot in facta place that
deserves to be recommended in the warmest possible manner either for
invalids or for people who are well

Mrs Stockmann Yes but my dear Thomas

Dr Stockmann And we have been recommending it and praising itI have
written and written both in the Messenger and in pamphlets

Hovstad Well what then

Dr Stockmann And the Bathswe have called them the main artery of
the towns lifeblood the nervecentre of our town and the devil
knows what else

Billing The towns pulsating heart was the expression I once used on
an important occasion

Dr Stockmann Quite so Well do you know what they really are these
great splendid much praised Baths that have cost so much moneydo
you know what they are

Hovstad No what are they

Mrs Stockmann Yes what are they

Dr Stockmann The whole place is a pesthouse

Petra The Baths father

Mrs Stockmann at the same time Our Baths

Hovstad But Doctor

Billing Absolutely incredible

Dr Stockmann The whole Bath establishment is a whited poisoned
sepulchre I tell youthe gravest possible danger to the public
health All the nastiness up at Molledal all that stinking filth is
infecting the water in the conduitpipes leading to the reservoir and
the same cursed filthy poison oozes out on the shore too

Horster Where the bathingplace is

Dr Stockmann Just there

Hovstad How do you come to be so certain of all this Doctor

Dr Stockmann I have investigated the matter most conscientiously For
a long time past I have suspected something of the kind Last year we
had some very strange cases of illness among the visitorstyphoid
cases and cases of gastric fever

Mrs Stockmann Yes that is quite true

Dr Stockmann At the time we supposed the visitors had been infected
before they came but later on in the winter I began to have a
different opinion and so I set myself to examine the water as well as
I could

Mrs Stockmann Then that is what you have been so busy with

Dr Stockmann Indeed I have been busy Katherine But here I had none
of the necessary scientific apparatus so I sent samples both of the
drinkingwater and of the seawater up to the University to have an
accurate analysis made by a chemist

Hovstad And have you got that

Dr Stockmann showing him the letter Here it is It proves the
presence of decomposing organic matter in the waterit is full of
infusoria The water is absolutely dangerous to use either internally
or externally

Mrs Stockmann What a mercy you discovered it in time

Dr Stockmann You may well say so

Hovstad And what do you propose to do now Doctor

Dr Stockmann To see the matter put right naturally

Hovstad Can that be done

Dr Stockmann It must be done Otherwise the Baths will be absolutely
useless and wasted But we need not anticipate that I have a very
clear idea what we shall have to do

Mrs Stockmann But why have you kept this all so secret dear

Dr Stockmann Do you suppose I was going to run about the town
gossiping about it before I had absolute proof No thank you I am
not such a fool

Petra Still you might have told us

Dr Stockmann Not a living soul But tomorrow you may run around to
the old Badger

Mrs Stockmann Oh Thomas Thomas

Dr Stockmann Well to your grandfather then The old boy will have
something to be astonished at I know he thinks I am crackedand there
are lots of other people who think so too I have noticed But now
these good folks shall seethey shall just see Walks about rubbing
his hands There will be a nice upset in the town Katherine you
cant imagine what it will be All the conduitpipes will have to be
relaid

Hovstad getting up All the conduitpipes

Dr Stockmann Yes of course The intake is too low down it will have
to be lifted to a position much higher up

Petra Then you were right after all

Dr Stockmann Ah you remember PetraI wrote opposing the plans
before the work was begun But at that time no one would listen to me
Well I am going to let them have it now Of course I have prepared a
report for the Baths Committee I have had it ready for a week and was
only waiting for this to come Shows the letter Now it shall go off
at once Goes into his room and comes back with some papers Look at
that Four closely written sheetsand the letter shall go with them
Give me a bit of paper Katherinesomething to wrap them up in That
will do Now give it totostamps his footwhat the deuce is her
namegive it to the maid and tell her to take it at once to the
Mayor

Mrs Stockmann takes the packet and goes out through the diningroom

Petra What do you think Uncle Peter will say father

Dr Stockmann What is there for him to say I should think he would be
very glad that such an important truth has been brought to light

Hovstad Will you let me print a short note about your discovery in the
Messenger

Dr Stockmann I shall be very much obliged if you will

Hovstad It is very desirable that the public should be informed of it
without delay

Dr Stockmann Certainly

Mrs Stockmann coming back She has just gone with it

Billing Upon my soul Doctor you are going to be the foremost man in
the town

 Dr Stockmann walking about happily Nonsense As a matter of
fact I have done nothing more than my duty I have only made a lucky
findthats all Still all the same

Billing Hovstad dont you think the town ought to give Dr Stockmann
some sort of testimonial

Hovstad I will suggest it anyway

Billing And I will speak to Aslaksen about it

Dr Stockmann No my good friends dont let us have any of that
nonsense I wont hear anything of the kind And if the Baths Committee
should think of voting me an increase of salary I will not accept it
Do you hear KatherineI wont accept it

Mrs Stockmann You are quite right Thomas

Petra lifting her glass Your health father

Hovstad and Billing Your health Doctor Good health

Horster touches glasses with DR STOCKMANN I hope it will bring you
nothing but good luck

Dr Stockmann Thank you thank you my dear fellows I feel
tremendously happy It is a splendid thing for a man to be able to feel
that he has done a service to his native town and to his
fellowcitizens Hurrah Katherine He puts his arms round her and
whirls her round and round while she protests with laughing cries
They all laugh clap their hands and cheer the DOCTOR The boys put
their heads in at the door to see what is going on


ACT II

SCENEThe same The door into the dining room is shut It is
morning MRS STOCKMANN with a sealed letter in her hand comes in
from the dining room goes to the door of the DOCTORS study and peeps
in

Mrs Stockmann Are you in Thomas

Dr Stockmann from within his room Yes I have just come in Comes
into the room What is it

Mrs Stockmann A letter from your brother

Dr Stockmann Aha let us see Opens the letter and reads I return
herewith the manuscript you sent me reads on in a low murmur Hm

Mrs Stockmann What does he say

Dr Stockmann putting the papers in his pocket Oh he only writes
that he will come up here himself about midday

Mrs Stockmann Well try and remember to be at home this time

Dr Stockmann That will be all right I have got through all my
morning visits

Mrs Stockmann I am extremely curious to know how he takes it

Dr Stockmann You will see he wont like its having been I and not
he that made the discovery

Mrs Stockmann Arent you a little nervous about that

Dr Stockmann Oh he really will be pleased enough you know But at
the same time Peter is so confoundedly afraid of anyones doing any
service to the town except himself

Mrs Stockmann I will tell you what Thomasyou should be good
natured and share the credit of this with him Couldnt you make out
that it was he who set you on the scent of this discovery

Dr Stockmann I am quite willing If only I can get the thing set
right I

MORTEN KIIL puts his head in through the door leading from the hall
looks around in an enquiring manner and chuckles

Morten Kiil slyly Is itis it true

Mrs Stockmann going to the door Fatheris it you

Dr Stockmann Ah Mr Kiilgood morning good morning

Mrs Stockmann But come along in

Morten Kiil If it is true I will if not I am off

Dr Stockmann If what is true

Morten Kiil This tale about the water supply is it true

Dr Stockmann Certainly it is true but how did you come to hear it

Morten Kiil coming in Petra ran in on her way to the school

Dr Stockmann Did she

Morten Kiil Yes and she declares thatI thought she was only making
a fool of mebut it isnt like Petra to do that

Dr Stockmann Of course not How could you imagine such a thing

Morten Kiil Oh well it is better never to trust anybody you may find
you have been made a fool of before you know where you are But it is
really true all the same

Dr Stockmann You can depend upon it that it is true Wont you sit
down Settles him on the couch Isnt it a real bit of luck for the
town

Morten Kiil suppressing his laughter A bit of luck for the town

Dr Stockmann Yes that I made the discovery in good time

Morten Kiil as before Yes yes YesBut I should never have
thought you the sort of man to pull your own brothers leg like this

Dr Stockmann Pull his leg

Mrs Stockmann Really father dear

Morten Kiil resting his hands and his chin on the handle of his stick
and winking slyly at the DOCTOR Let me see what was the story Some
kind of beast that had got into the waterpipes wasnt it

Dr Stockmann Infusoriayes

Morten Kiil And a lot of these beasts had got in according to
Petraa tremendous lot

Dr Stockmann Certainly hundreds of thousands of them probably

Morten Kiil But no one can see themisnt that so

Dr Stockmann Yes you cant see them

Morten Kiil with a quiet chuckle Damnits the finest story I have
ever heard

Dr Stockmann What do you mean

Morten Kiil But you will never get the Mayor to believe a thing like
that

Dr Stockmann We shall see

Morten Kiil Do you think he will be fool enough to

Dr Stockmann I hope the whole town will be fools enough

Morten Kiil The whole town Well it wouldnt be a bad thing It would
just serve them right and teach them a lesson They think themselves
so much cleverer than we old fellows They hounded me out of the
council they did I tell youthey hounded me out Now they shall pay
for it You pull their legs too Thomas

Dr Stockmann Really I

Morten Kiil You pull their legs Gets up If you can work it so that
the Mayor and his friends all swallow the same bait I will give ten
pounds to a charitylike a shot

Dr Stockmann That is very kind of you

Morten Kiil Yes I havent got much money to throw away I can tell
you but if you can work this I will give five pounds to a charity at
Christmas

HOVSTAD comes in by the hall door

Hovstad Good morning Stops Oh I beg your pardon

Dr Stockmann Not at all come in

Morten Kiil with another chuckle Ohois he in this too

Hovstad What do you mean

Dr Stockmann Certainly he is

Morten Kiil I might have known it It must get into the papers You
know how to do it Thomas Set your wits to work Now I must go

Dr Stockmann Wont you stay a little while

Morten Kiil No I must be off now You keep up this game for all it is
worth you wont repent it Im damned if you will

He goes out MRS STOCKMANN follows him into the hall

Dr Stockmann laughing Just imaginethe old chap doesnt believe a
word of all this about the water supply

Hovstad Oh that was it then

Dr Stockmann Yes that was what we were talking about Perhaps it is
the same thing that brings you here

Hovstad Yes it is Can you spare me a few minutes Doctor

Dr Stockmann As long as you like my dear fellow

Hovstad Have you heard from the Mayor yet

Dr Stockmann Not yet He is coming here later

Hovstad I have given the matter a great deal of thought since last
night

Dr Stockmann Well

Hovstad From your point of view as a doctor and a man of science
this affair of the water supply is an isolated matter I mean you do
not realise that it involves a great many other things

Dr Stockmann How do you meanLet us sit down my dear fellow No
sit here on the couch HOVSTAD Sits down on the couch DR STOCKMANN
On a chair on the other side of the table Now then You mean that

Hovstad You said yesterday that the pollution of the water was due to
impurities in the soil

Dr Stockmann Yes unquestionably it is due to that poisonous morass
up at Molledal

Hovstad Begging your pardon Doctor I fancy it is due to quite
another morass altogether

Dr Stockmann What morass

Hovstad The morass that the whole life of our town is built on and is
rotting in

Dr Stockmann What the deuce are you driving at Hovstad

Hovstad The whole of the towns interests have little by little got
into the hands of a pack of officials

Dr Stockmann Oh comethey are not all officials

Hovstad No but those that are not officials are at any rate the
officials friends and adherents it is the wealthy folk the old
families in the town that have got us entirely in their hands

Dr Stockmann Yes but after all they are men of ability and knowledge

Hovstad Did they show any ability or knowledge when they laid the
conduit pipes where they are now

Dr Stockmann No of course that was a great piece of stupidity on
their part But that is going to be set right now

Hovstad Do you think that will be all such plain sailing

Dr Stockmann Plain sailing or no it has got to be done anyway

Hovstad Yes provided the press takes up the question

Dr Stockmann I dont think that will be necessary my dear fellow I
am certain my brother

Hovstad Excuse me doctor I feel bound to tell you I am inclined to
take the matter up

Dr Stockmann In the paper

Hovstad Yes When I took over the Peoples Messenger my idea was to
break up this ring of selfopinionated old fossils who had got hold of
all the influence

Dr Stockmann But you know you told me yourself what the result had
been you nearly ruined your paper

Hovstad Yes at the time we were obliged to climb down a peg or two
it is quite truebecause there was a danger of the whole project of
the Baths coming to nothing if they failed us But now the scheme has
been carried through and we can dispense with these grand gentlemen

Dr Stockmann Dispense with them yes but we owe them a great debt
of gratitude

Hovstad That shall be recognised ungrudgingly But a journalist of my
democratic tendencies cannot let such an opportunity as this slip The
bubble of official infallibility must be pricked This superstition
must be destroyed like any other

Dr Stockmann I am wholeheartedly with you in that Mr Hovstad if
it is a superstition away with it

Hovstad I should be very reluctant to bring the Mayor into it because
he is your brother But I am sure you will agree with me that truth
should be the first consideration

Dr Stockmann That goes without saying With sudden emphasis Yes
butbut

Hovstad You must not misjudge me I am neither more selfinterested
nor more ambitious than most men

Dr Stockmann My dear fellowwho suggests anything of the kind

Hovstad I am of humble origin as you know and that has given me
opportunities of knowing what is the most crying need in the humbler
ranks of life It is that they should be allowed some part in the
direction of public affairs Doctor That is what will develop their
faculties and intelligence and self respect

Dr Stockmann I quite appreciate that

Hovstad Yesand in my opinion a journalist incurs a heavy
responsibility if he neglects a favourable opportunity of emancipating
the massesthe humble and oppressed I know well enough that in
exalted circles I shall be called an agitator and all that sort of
thing but they may call what they like If only my conscience doesnt
reproach me then

Dr Stockmann Quite right Quite right Mr Hovstad But all the
samedevil take it A knock is heard at the door Come in

ASLAKSEN appears at the door He is poorly but decently dressed in
black with a slightly crumpled white neckcloth he wears gloves and
has a felt hat in his hand

Aslaksen bowing Excuse my taking the liberty Doctor

Dr Stockmann getting up Ah it is you Aslaksen

Aslaksen Yes Doctor

Hovstad standing up Is it me you want Aslaksen

Aslaksen No I didnt know I should find you here No it was the
Doctor I

Dr Stockmann I am quite at your service What is it

Aslaksen Is what I heard from Mr Billing true sirthat you mean to
improve our water supply

Dr Stockmann Yes for the Baths

Aslaksen Quite so I understand Well I have come to say that I will
back that up by every means in my power

Hovstad to the DOCTOR You see

Dr Stockmann I shall be very grateful to you but

Aslaksen Because it may be no bad thing to have us small tradesmen at
your back We form as it were a compact majority in the townif we
choose And it is always a good thing to have the majority with you
Doctor

Dr Stockmann That is undeniably true but I confess I dont see why
such unusual precautions should be necessary in this case It seems to
me that such a plain straightforward thing

Aslaksen Oh it may be very desirable all the same I know our local
authorities so well officials are not generally very ready to act on
proposals that come from other people That is why I think it would not
be at all amiss if we made a little demonstration

Hovstad Thats right

Dr Stockmann Demonstration did you say What on earth are you going
to make a demonstration about

Aslaksen We shall proceed with the greatest moderation Doctor
Moderation is always my aim it is the greatest virtue in a citizenat
least I think so

Dr Stockmann It is well known to be a characteristic of yours Mr
Aslaksen

Aslaksen Yes I think I may pride myself on that And this matter of
the water supply is of the greatest importance to us small tradesmen
The Baths promise to be a regular goldmine for the town We shall all
make our living out of them especially those of us who are
householders That is why we will back up the project as strongly as
possible And as I am at present Chairman of the Householders
Association

Dr Stockmann Yes

Aslaksen And what is more local secretary of the Temperance
Societyyou know sir I suppose that I am a worker in the temperance
cause

Dr Stockmann Of course of course

Aslaksen Well you can understand that I come into contact with a
great many people And as I have the reputation of a temperate and
lawabiding citizenlike yourself DoctorI have a certain influence
in the town a little bit of power if I may be allowed to say so

Dr Stockmann I know that quite well Mr Aslaksen

Aslaksen So you see it would be an easy matter for me to set on foot
some testimonial if necessary

Dr Stockmann A testimonial

Aslaksen Yes some kind of an address of thanks from the townsmen for
your share in a matter of such importance to the community I need
scarcely say that it would have to be drawn up with the greatest regard
to moderation so as not to offend the authoritieswho after all
have the reins in their hands If we pay strict attention to that no
one can take it amiss I should think

Hovstad Well and even supposing they didnt like it

Aslaksen No no no there must be no discourtesy to the authorities
Mr Hovstad It is no use falling foul of those upon whom our welfare
so closely depends I have done that in my time and no good ever comes
of it But no one can take exception to a reasonable and frank
expression of a citizens views

Dr Stockmann shaking him by the hand I cant tell you dear Mr
Aslaksen how extremely pleased I am to find such hearty support among
my fellowcitizens I am delighteddelighted Now you will take a
small glass of sherry eh

Aslaksen No thank you I never drink alcohol of that kind

Dr Stockmann Well what do you say to a glass of beer then

Aslaksen Nor that either thank you Doctor I never drink anything as
early as this I am going into town now to talk this over with one or
two householders and prepare the ground

Dr Stockmann It is tremendously kind of you Mr Aslaksen but I
really cannot understand the necessity for all these precautions It
seems to me that the thing should go of itself

Aslaksen The authorities are somewhat slow to move Doctor Far be it
from me to seem to blame them

Hovstad We are going to stir them up in the paper tomorrow Aslaksen

Aslaksen But not violently I trust Mr Hovstad Proceed with
moderation or you will do nothing with them You may take my advice I
have gathered my experience in the school of life Well I must say
goodbye Doctor You know now that we small tradesmen are at your back
at all events like a solid wall You have the compact majority on your
side Doctor

Dr Stockmann I am very much obliged dear Mr Aslaksen Shakes hands
with him Goodbye goodbye

Aslaksen Are you going my way towards the printingoffice Mr
Hovstad

Hovstad I will come later I have something to settle up first

Aslaksen Very well Bows and goes out STOCKMANN follows him into the
hall

Hovstad as STOCKMANN comes in again Well what do you think of that
Doctor Dont you think it is high time we stirred a little life into
all this slackness and vacillation and cowardice

Dr Stockmann Are you referring to Aslaksen

Hovstad Yes I am He is one of those who are floundering in a
bogdecent enough fellow though he may be otherwise And most of the
people here are in just the same caseseesawing and edging first to
one side and then to the other so overcome with caution and scruple
that they never dare to take any decided step

Dr Stockmann Yes but Aslaksen seemed to me so thoroughly
wellintentioned

Hovstad There is one thing I esteem higher than that and that is for
a man to be selfreliant and sure of himself

Dr Stockmann I think you are perfectly right there

Hovstad That is why I want to seize this opportunity and try if I
cannot manage to put a little virility into these wellintentioned
people for once The idol of Authority must be shattered in this town
This gross and inexcusable blunder about the water supply must be
brought home to the mind of every municipal voter

Dr Stockmann Very well if you are of opinion that it is for the good
of the community so be it But not until I have had a talk with my
brother

Hovstad Anyway I will get a leading article ready and if the Mayor
refuses to take the matter up

Dr Stockmann How can you suppose such a thing possible

Hovstad It is conceivable And in that case

Dr Stockmann In that case I promise you Look here in that case
you may print my reportevery word of it

Hovstad May I Have I your word for it

Dr Stockmann giving him the MS Here it is take it with you It
can do no harm for you to read it through and you can give it me back
later on

Hovstad Good good That is what I will do And now goodbye Doctor

Dr Stockmann Goodbye goodbye You will see everything will run quite
smoothly Mr Hovstadquite smoothly

Hovstad Hmwe shall see Bows and goes out

Dr Stockmann opens the diningroom door and looks in Katherine Oh
you are back Petra

Petra coming in Yes I have just come from the school

Mrs Stockmann coming in Has he not been here yet

Dr Stockmann Peter No but I have had a long talk with Hovstad He
is quite excited about my discovery I find it has a much wider bearing
than I at first imagined And he has put his paper at my disposal if
necessity should arise

Mrs Stockmann Do you think it will

Dr Stockmann Not for a moment But at all events it makes me feel
proud to know that I have the liberalminded independent press on my
side Yes and just imagineI have had a visit from the Chairman of
the Householders Association

Mrs Stockmann Oh What did he want

Dr Stockmann To offer me his support too They will support me in a
body if it should be necessary Katherinedo you know what I have got
behind me

Mrs Stockmann Behind you No what have you got behind you

Dr Stockmann The compact majority

Mrs Stockmann Really Is that a good thing for you Thomas

Dr Stockmann I should think it was a good thing Walks up and down
rubbing his hands By Jove its a fine thing to feel this bond of
brotherhood between oneself and ones fellow citizens

Petra And to be able to do so much that is good and useful father

Dr Stockmann And for ones own native town into the bargain my child

Mrs Stockmann That was a ring at the bell

Dr Stockmann It must be he then A knock is heard at the door
Come in

Peter Stockmann comes in from the hall Good morning

Dr Stockmann Glad to see you Peter

Mrs Stockmann Good morning Peter How are you

Peter Stockmann So so thank you To DR STOCKMANN I received from
you yesterday after office hours a report dealing with the condition
of the water at the Baths

Dr Stockmann Yes Have you read it

Peter Stockmann Yes I have

Dr Stockmann And what have you to say to it

Peter Stockmann with a sidelong glance Hm

Mrs Stockmann Come along Petra She and PETRA go into the room on
the left

Peter Stockmann after a pause Was it necessary to make all these
investigations behind my back

Dr Stockmann Yes because until I was absolutely certain about it

Peter Stockmann Then you mean that you are absolutely certain now

Dr Stockmann Surely you are convinced of that

Peter Stockmann Is it your intention to bring this document before the
Baths Committee as a sort of official communication

Dr Stockmann Certainly Something must be done in the matterand
that quickly

Peter Stockmann As usual you employ violent expressions in your
report You say amongst other things that what we offer visitors in
our Baths is a permanent supply of poison

Dr Stockmann Well can you describe it any other way Peter Just
thinkwater that is poisonous whether you drink it or bathe in it
And this we offer to the poor sick folk who come to us trustfully and
pay us at an exorbitant rate to be made well again

Peter Stockmann And your reasoning leads you to this conclusion that
we must build a sewer to draw off the alleged impurities from Molledal
and must relay the water conduits

Dr Stockmann Yes Do you see any other way out of it I dont

Peter Stockmann I made a pretext this morning to go and see the town
engineer and as if only half seriously broached the subject of these
proposals as a thing we might perhaps have to take under consideration
some time later on

Dr Stockmann Some time later on

Peter Stockmann He smiled at what he considered to be my extravagance
naturally Have you taken the trouble to consider what your proposed
alterations would cost According to the information I obtained the
expenses would probably mount up to fifteen or twenty thousand pounds

Dr Stockmann Would it cost so much

Peter Stockmann Yes and the worst part of it would be that the work
would take at least two years

Dr Stockmann Two years Two whole years

Peter Stockmann At least And what are we to do with the Baths in the
meantime Close them Indeed we should be obliged to And do you
suppose anyone would come near the place after it had got out that the
water was dangerous

Dr Stockmann Yes but Peter that is what it is

Peter Stockmann And all this at this juncturejust as the Baths are
beginning to be known There are other towns in the neighbourhood with
qualifications to attract visitors for bathing purposes Dont you
suppose they would immediately strain every nerve to divert the entire
stream of strangers to themselves Unquestionably they would and then
where should we be We should probably have to abandon the whole thing
which has cost us so much moneyand then you would have ruined your
native town

Dr Stockmann Ishould have ruined

Peter Stockmann It is simply and solely through the Baths that the
town has before it any future worth mentioning You know that just as
well as I

Dr Stockmann But what do you think ought to be done then

Peter Stockmann Your report has not convinced me that the condition of
the water at the Baths is as bad as you represent it to be

Dr Stockmann I tell you it is even worseor at all events it will
be in summer when the warm weather comes

Peter Stockmann As I said I believe you exaggerate the matter
considerably A capable physician ought to know what measures to
takehe ought to be capable of preventing injurious influences or of
remedying them if they become obviously persistent

Dr Stockmann Well What more

Peter Stockmann The water supply for the Baths is now an established
fact and in consequence must be treated as such But probably the
Committee at its discretion will not be disinclined to consider the
question of how far it might be possible to introduce certain
improvements consistently with a reasonable expenditure

Dr Stockmann And do you suppose that I will have anything to do with
such a piece of trickery as that

Peter Stockmann Trickery

Dr Stockmann Yes it would be a tricka fraud a lie a downright
crime towards the public towards the whole community

Peter Stockmann I have not as I remarked before been able to
convince myself that there is actually any imminent danger

Dr Stockmann You have It is impossible that you should not be
convinced I know I have represented the facts absolutely truthfully
and fairly And you know it very well Peter only you wont
acknowledge it It was owing to your action that both the Baths and the
water conduits were built where they are and that is what you wont
acknowledgethat damnable blunder of yours Poohdo you suppose I
dont see through you

Peter Stockmann And even if that were true If I perhaps guard my
reputation somewhat anxiously it is in the interests of the town
Without moral authority I am powerless to direct public affairs as
seems to my judgment to be best for the common good And on that
accountand for various other reasons tooit appears to me to be a
matter of importance that your report should not be delivered to the
Committee In the interests of the public you must withhold it Then
later on I will raise the question and we will do our best privately
but nothing of this unfortunate affair not a single word of itmust
come to the ears of the public

Dr Stockmann I am afraid you will not be able to prevent that now my
dear Peter

Peter Stockmann It must and shall be prevented

Dr Stockmann It is no use I tell you There are too many people that
know about it

Peter Stockmann That know about it Who Surely you dont mean those
fellows on the Peoples Messenger

Dr Stockmann Yes they know The liberalminded independent press is
going to see that you do your duty

Peter Stockmann after a short pause You are an extraordinarily
independent man Thomas Have you given no thought to the consequences
this may have for yourself

Dr Stockmann Consequencesfor me

Peter Stockmann For you and yours yes

Dr Stockmann What the deuce do you mean

Peter Stockmann I believe I have always behaved in a brotherly way to
youhavent I always been ready to oblige or to help you

Dr Stockmann Yes you have and I am grateful to you for it

Peter Stockmann There is no need Indeed to some extent I was forced
to do sofor my own sake I always hoped that if I helped to improve
your financial position I should be able to keep some check on you

Dr Stockmann What Then it was only for your own sake

Peter Stockmann Up to a certain point yes It is painful for a man in
an official position to have his nearest relative compromising himself
time after time

Dr Stockmann And do you consider that I do that

Peter Stockmann Yes unfortunately you do without even being aware
of it You have a restless pugnacious rebellious disposition And
then there is that disastrous propensity of yours to want to write
about every sort of possible and impossible thing The moment an idea
comes into your head you must needs go and write a newspaper article
or a whole pamphlet about it

Dr Stockmann Well but is it not the duty of a citizen to let the
public share in any new ideas he may have

Peter Stockmann Oh the public doesnt require any new ideas The
public is best served by the good old established ideas it already has

Dr Stockmann And that is your honest opinion

Peter Stockmann Yes and for once I must talk frankly to you Hitherto
I have tried to avoid doing so because I know how irritable you are
but now I must tell you the truth Thomas You have no conception what
an amount of harm you do yourself by your impetuosity You complain of
the authorities you even complain of the governmentyou are always
pulling them to pieces you insist that you have been neglected and
persecuted But what else can such a cantankerous man as you expect

Dr Stockmann What next Cantankerous am I

Peter Stockmann Yes Thomas you are an extremely cantankerous man to
work withI know that to my cost You disregard everything that you
ought to have consideration for You seem completely to forget that it
is me you have to thank for your appointment here as medical officer to
the Baths

Dr Stockmann I was entitled to it as a matter of courseI and
nobody else I was the first person to see that the town could be made
into a flourishing wateringplace and I was the only one who saw it at
that time I had to fight singlehanded in support of the idea for many
years and I wrote and wrote

Peter Stockmann Undoubtedly But things were not ripe for the scheme
thenthough of course you could not judge of that in your
outoftheway corner up north But as soon as the opportune moment
came Iand the otherstook the matter into our hands

Dr Stockmann Yes and made this mess of all my beautiful plan It is
pretty obvious now what clever fellows you were

Peter Stockmann To my mind the whole thing only seems to mean that you
are seeking another outlet for your combativeness You want to pick a
quarrel with your superiorsan old habit of yours You cannot put up
with any authority over you You look askance at anyone who occupies a
superior official position you regard him as a personal enemy and
then any stick is good enough to beat him with But now I have called
your attention to the fact that the towns interests are at stakeand
incidentally my own too And therefore I must tell you Thomas that
you will find me inexorable with regard to what I am about to require
you to do

Dr Stockmann And what is that

Peter Stockmann As you have been so indiscreet as to speak of this
delicate matter to outsiders despite the fact that you ought to have
treated it as entirely official and confidential it is obviously
impossible to hush it up now All sorts of rumours will get about
directly and everybody who has a grudge against us will take care to
embellish these rumours So it will be necessary for you to refute them
publicly

Dr Stockmann I How I dont understand

Peter Stockmann What we shall expect is that after making further
investigations you will come to the conclusion that the matter is not
by any means as dangerous or as critical as you imagined in the first
instance

Dr Stockmann Ohoso that is what you expect

Peter Stockmann And what is more we shall expect you to make public
profession of your confidence in the Committee and in their readiness
to consider fully and conscientiously what steps may be necessary to
remedy any possible defects

Dr Stockmann But you will never be able to do that by patching and
tinkering at itnever Take my word for it Peter I mean what I say
as deliberately and emphatically as possible

Peter Stockmann As an officer under the Committee you have no right
to any individual opinion

Dr Stockmann amazed No right

Peter Stockmann In your official capacity no As a private person it
is quite another matter But as a subordinate member of the staff of
the Baths you have no right to express any opinion which runs contrary
to that of your superiors

Dr Stockmann This is too much I a doctor a man of science have no
right to

Peter Stockmann The matter in hand is not simply a scientific one It
is a complicated matter and has its economic as well as its technical
side

Dr Stockmann I dont care what it is I intend to be free to express
my opinion on any subject under the sun

Peter Stockmann As you pleasebut not on any subject concerning the
Baths That we forbid

Dr Stockmann shouting You forbid You A pack of

Peter Stockmann I forbid itI your chief and if I forbid it you
have to obey

Dr Stockmann controlling himself Peterif you were not my brother

Petra throwing open the door Father you shant stand this

Mrs Stockmann coming in after her Petra Petra

Peter Stockmann Oh so you have been eavesdropping

Mrs Stockmann You were talking so loud we couldnt help it

Petra Yes I was listening

Peter Stockmann Well after all I am very glad

Dr Stockmann going up to him You were saying something about
forbidding and obeying

Peter Stockmann You obliged me to take that tone with you

Dr Stockmann And so I am to give myself the lie publicly

Peter Stockmann We consider it absolutely necessary that you should
make some such public statement as I have asked for

Dr Stockmann And if I do notobey

Peter Stockmann Then we shall publish a statement ourselves to
reassure the public

Dr Stockmann Very well but in that case I shall use my pen against
you I stick to what I have said I will show that I am right and that
you are wrong And what will you do then

Peter Stockmann Then I shall not be able to prevent your being
dismissed

Dr Stockmann What

Petra Fatherdismissed

Mrs Stockmann Dismissed

Peter Stockmann Dismissed from the staff of the Baths I shall be
obliged to propose that you shall immediately be given notice and
shall not be allowed any further participation in the Baths affairs

Dr Stockmann You would dare to do that

Peter Stockmann It is you that are playing the daring game

Petra Uncle that is a shameful way to treat a man like father

Mrs Stockmann Do hold your tongue Petra

Peter Stockmann looking at PETRA Oh so we volunteer our opinions
already do we Of course To MRS STOCKMANN Katherine I imagine
you are the most sensible person in this house Use any influence you
may have over your husband and make him see what this will entail for
his family as well as

Dr Stockmann My family is my own concern and nobody elses

Peter Stockmann for his own family as I was saying as well as for
the town he lives in

Dr Stockmann It is I who have the real good of the town at heart I
want to lay bare the defects that sooner or later must come to the
light of day I will show whether I love my native town

Peter Stockmann You who in your blind obstinacy want to cut off the
most important source of the towns welfare

Dr Stockmann The source is poisoned man Are you mad We are making
our living by retailing filth and corruption The whole of our
flourishing municipal life derives its sustenance from a lie

Peter Stockmann All imaginationor something even worse The man who
can throw out such offensive insinuations about his native town must be
an enemy to our community

Dr Stockmann going up to him Do you dare to

Mrs Stockmann throwing herself between them Thomas

Petra catching her father by the arm Dont lose your temper father

Peter Stockmann I will not expose myself to violence Now you have had
a warning so reflect on what you owe to yourself and your family
Goodbye Goes out

Dr Stockmann walking up and down Am I to put up with such treatment
as this In my own house Katherine What do you think of that

Mrs Stockmann Indeed it is both shameful and absurd Thomas

Petra If only I could give uncle a piece of my mind

Dr Stockmann It is my own fault I ought to have flown out at him
long agoshown my teethbitten To hear him call me an enemy to our
community Me I shall not take that lying down upon my soul

Mrs Stockmann But dear Thomas your brother has power on his side

Dr Stockmann Yes but I have right on mine I tell you

Mrs Stockmann Oh yes rightright What is the use of having right
on your side if you have not got might

Petra Oh motherhow can you say such a thing

Dr Stockmann Do you imagine that in a free country it is no use
having right on your side You are absurd Katherine Besides havent
I got the liberalminded independent press to lead the way and the
compact majority behind me That is might enough I should think

Mrs Stockmann But good heavens Thomas you dont mean to

Dr Stockmann Dont mean to what

Mrs Stockmann To set yourself up in opposition to your brother

Dr Stockmann In Gods name what else do you suppose I should do but
take my stand on right and truth

Petra Yes I was just going to say that

Mrs Stockmann But it wont do you any earthly good If they wont do
it they wont

Dr Stockmann Oho Katherine Just give me time and you will see how
I will carry the war into their camp

Mrs Stockmann Yes you carry the war into their camp and you get
your dismissalthat is what you will do

Dr Stockmann In any case I shall have done my duty towards the
publictowards the community I who am called its enemy

Mrs Stockmann But towards your family Thomas Towards your own home
Do you think that is doing your duty towards those you have to provide
for

Petra Ah dont think always first of us mother

Mrs Stockmann Oh it is easy for you to talk you are able to shift
for yourself if need be But remember the boys Thomas and think a
little of yourself too and of me

Dr Stockmann I think you are out of your senses Katherine If I were
to be such a miserable coward as to go on my knees to Peter and his
damned crew do you suppose I should ever know an hours peace of mind
all my life afterwards

Mrs Stockmann I dont know anything about that but God preserve us
from the peace of mind we shall have all the same if you go on
defying him You will find yourself again without the means of
subsistence with no income to count upon I should think we had had
enough of that in the old days Remember that Thomas think what that
means

Dr Stockmann collecting himself with a struggle and clenching his
fists And this is what this slavery can bring upon a free honourable
man Isnt it horrible Katherine

Mrs Stockmann Yes it is sinful to treat you so it is perfectly
true But good heavens one has to put up with so much injustice in
this world There are the boys Thomas Look at them What is to become
of them Oh no no you can never have the heart EJLIF and MORTEN
have come in while she was speaking with their school books in their
hands

Dr Stockmann The boys I Recovers himself suddenly No even if
the whole world goes to pieces I will never bow my neck to this yokel
Goes towards his room

Mrs Stockmann following him Thomaswhat are you going to do

Dr Stockmann at his door I mean to have the right to look my sons
in the face when they are grown men Goes into his room

Mrs Stockmann bursting into tears God help us all

Petra Father is splendid He will not give in

The boys look on in amazement PETRA signs to them not to speak

is another door with glass panels through which the printing room can
be seen Another door in the righthand wall In the middle of the room
is a large table covered with papers newspapers and books In the
foreground on the left a window before which stands a desk and a high
stool There are a couple of easy chairs by the table and other chairs
standing along the wall The room is dingy and uncomfortable the
furniture is old the chairs stained and torn In the printing room the
compositors are seen at work and a printer is working a handpress
HOVSTAD is sitting at the desk writing BILLING comes in from the
right with DR STOCKMANNS manuscript in his hand

Billing Well I must say

Hovstad still writing Have you read it through

Billing laying the MS on the desk Yes indeed I have

Hovstad Dont you think the Doctor hits them pretty hard

Billing Hard Bless my soul hes crushing Every word falls likehow
shall I put itlike the blow of a sledgehammer

Hovstad Yes but they are not the people to throw up the sponge at the
first blow

Billing That is true and for that reason we must strike blow upon
blow until the whole of this aristocracy tumbles to pieces As I sat in
there reading this I almost seemed to see a revolution in being

Hovstad turning round HushSpeak so that Aslaksen cannot hear you

Billing lowering his voice Aslaksen is a chickenhearted chap a
coward there is nothing of the man in him But this time you will
insist on your own way wont you You will put the Doctors article in

Hovstad Yes and if the Mayor doesnt like it

Billing That will be the devil of a nuisance

Hovstad Well fortunately we can turn the situation to good account
whatever happens If the Mayor will not fall in with the Doctors
project he will have all the small tradesmen down on himthe whole of
the Householders Association and the rest of them And if he does fall
in with it he will fall out with the whole crowd of large shareholders
in the Baths who up to now have been his most valuable supporters

Billing Yes because they will certainly have to fork out a pretty
penny

Hovstad Yes you may be sure they will And in this way the ring will
be broken up you see and then in every issue of the paper we will
enlighten the public on the Mayors incapability on one point and
another and make it clear that all the positions of trust in the town
the whole control of municipal affairs ought to be put in the hands of
the Liberals

Billing That is perfectly true I see it comingI see it coming we
are on the threshold of a revolution

A knock is heard at the door

Hovstad Hush Calls out Come in DR STOCKMANN comes in by the
street door HOVSTAD goes to meet him Ah it is you Doctor Well

Dr Stockmann You may set to work and print it Mr Hovstad

Hovstad Has it come to that then

Billing Hurrah

Dr Stockmann Yes print away Undoubtedly it has come to that Now
they must take what they get There is going to be a fight in the town
Mr Billing

Billing War to the knife I hope We will get our knives to their
throats Doctor

Dr Stockmann This article is only a beginning I have already got
four or five more sketched out in my head Where is Aslaksen

Billing calls into the printingroom Aslaksen just come here for a
minute

Hovstad Four or five more articles did you say On the same subject

Dr Stockmann Nofar from it my dear fellow No they are about
quite another matter But they all spring from the question of the
water supply and the drainage One thing leads to another you know It
is like beginning to pull down an old house exactly

Billing Upon my soul its true you find you are not done till you
have pulled all the old rubbish down

Aslaksen coming in Pulled down You are not thinking of pulling down
the Baths surely Doctor

Hovstad Far from it dont be afraid

Dr Stockmann No we meant something quite different Well what do
you think of my article Mr Hovstad

Hovstad I think it is simply a masterpiece

Dr Stockmann Do you really think so Well I am very pleased very
pleased

Hovstad It is so clear and intelligible One need have no special
knowledge to understand the bearing of it You will have every
enlightened man on your side

Aslaksen And every prudent man too I hope

Billing The prudent and the imprudentalmost the whole town

Aslaksen In that case we may venture to print it

Dr Stockmann I should think so

Hovstad We will put it in tomorrow morning

Dr Stockmann Of courseyou must not lose a single day What I wanted
to ask you Mr Aslaksen was if you would supervise the printing of it
yourself

Aslaksen With pleasure

Dr Stockmann Take care of it as if it were a treasure No
misprintsevery word is important I will look in again a little
later perhaps you will be able to let me see a proof I cant tell you
how eager I am to see it in print and see it burst upon the public

Billing Burst upon themyes like a flash of lightning

Dr Stockmann and to have it submitted to the judgment of my
intelligent fellow townsmen You cannot imagine what I have gone
through today I have been threatened first with one thing and then
with another they have tried to rob me of my most elementary rights as
a man

Billing What Your rights as a man

Dr Stockmann they have tried to degrade me to make a coward of me
to force me to put personal interests before my most sacred convictions

Billing That is too muchIm damned if it isnt

Hovstad Oh you mustnt be surprised at anything from that quarter

Dr Stockmann Well they will get the worst of it with me they may
assure themselves of that I shall consider the Peoples Messenger my
sheetanchor now and every single day I will bombard them with one
article after another like bombshells

Aslaksen Yes but

Billing Hurrahit is war it is war

Dr Stockmann I shall smite them to the groundI shall crush themI
shall break down all their defenses before the eyes of the honest
public That is what I shall do

Aslaksen Yes but in moderation Doctorproceed with moderation

Billing Not a bit of it not a bit of it Dont spare the dynamite

Dr Stockmann Because it is not merely a question of watersupply and
drains now you know Noit is the whole of our social life that we
have got to purify and disinfect

Billing Spoken like a deliverer

Dr Stockmann All the incapables must be turned out you
understandand that in every walk of life Endless vistas have opened
themselves to my minds eye today I cannot see it all quite clearly
yet but I shall in time Young and vigorous standardbearersthose
are what we need and must seek my friends we must have new men in
command at all our outposts

Billing Hear hear

Dr Stockmann We only need to stand by one another and it will all be
perfectly easy The revolution will be launched like a ship that runs
smoothly off the stocks Dont you think so

Hovstad For my part I think we have now a prospect of getting the
municipal authority into the hands where it should lie

Aslaksen And if only we proceed with moderation I cannot imagine that
there will be any risk

Dr Stockmann Who the devil cares whether there is any risk or not
What I am doing I am doing in the name of truth and for the sake of my
conscience

Hovstad You are a man who deserves to be supported Doctor

Aslaksen Yes there is no denying that the Doctor is a true friend to
the towna real friend to the community that he is

Billing Take my word for it Aslaksen Dr Stockmann is a friend of
the people

Aslaksen I fancy the Householders Association will make use of that
expression before long

Dr Stockmann affected grasps their hands Thank you thank you my
dear staunch friends It is very refreshing to me to hear you say that
my brother called me something quite different By Jove he shall have
it back with interest But now I must be off to see a poor devilI
will come back as I said Keep a very careful eye on the manuscript
Aslaksen and dont for worlds leave out any of my notes of
exclamation Rather put one or two more in Capital capital Well
goodbye for the presentgoodbye goodbye They show him to the door
and bow him out

Hovstad He may prove an invaluably useful man to us

Aslaksen Yes so long as he confines himself to this matter of the
Baths But if he goes farther afield I dont think it would be
advisable to follow him

Hovstad Hmthat all depends

Billing You are so infernally timid Aslaksen

Aslaksen Timid Yes when it is a question of the local authorities I
am timid Mr Billing it is a lesson I have learned in the school of
experience let me tell you But try me in higher politics in matters
that concern the government itself and then see if I am timid

Billing No you arent I admit But this is simply contradicting
yourself

Aslaksen I am a man with a conscience and that is the whole matter
If you attack the government you dont do the community any harm
anyway those fellows pay no attention to attacks you seethey go on
just as they are in spite of them But local authorities are
different they can be turned out and then perhaps you may get an
ignorant lot into office who may do irreparable harm to the
householders and everybody else

Hovstad But what of the education of citizens by self
governmentdont you attach any importance to that

Aslaksen When a man has interests of his own to protect he cannot
think of everything Mr Hovstad

Hovstad Then I hope I shall never have interests of my own to protect

Billing Hear hear

Aslaksen with a smile Hm Points to the desk Mr Sheriff
Stensgaard was your predecessor at that editorial desk

Billing spitting Bah That turncoat

Hovstad I am not a weathercockand never will be

Aslaksen A politician should never be too certain of anything Mr
Hovstad And as for you Mr Billing I should think it is time for you
to be taking in a reef or two in your sails seeing that you are
applying for the post of secretary to the Bench

Billing I

Hovstad Are you Billing

Billing Well yesbut you must clearly understand I am only doing it
to annoy the bigwigs

Aslaksen Anyhow it is no business of mine But if I am to be accused
of timidity and of inconsistency in my principles this is what I want
to point out my political past is an open book I have never changed
except perhaps to become a little more moderate you see My heart is
still with the people but I dont deny that my reason has a certain
bias towards the authoritiesthe local ones I mean Goes into the
printing room

Billing Oughtnt we to try and get rid of him Hovstad

Hovstad Do you know anyone else who will advance the money for our
paper and printing bill

Billing It is an infernal nuisance that we dont possess some capital
to trade on

Hovstad sitting down at his desk Yes if we only had that then

Billing Suppose you were to apply to Dr Stockmann

Hovstad turning over some papers What is the use He has got nothing

Billing No but he has got a warm man in the background old Morten
Kiilthe Badger as they call him

Hovstad writing Are you so sure he has got anything

Billing Good Lord of course he has And some of it must come to the
Stockmanns Most probably he will do something for the children at all
events

Hovstad turning half round Are you counting on that

Billing Counting on it Of course I am not counting on anything

Hovstad That is right And I should not count on the secretaryship to
the Bench either if I were you for I can assure youyou wont get it

Billing Do you think I am not quite aware of that My object is
precisely not to get it A slight of that kind stimulates a mans
fighting powerit is like getting a supply of fresh bileand I am
sure one needs that badly enough in a holeandcorner place like this
where it is so seldom anything happens to stir one up

Hovstad writing Quite so quite so

Billing Ah I shall be heard of yetNow I shall go and write the
appeal to the Householders Association Goes into the room on the
right

Hovstad sitting al his desk biting his penholder says slowly
Hmthats it is it A knock is heard Come in PETRA comes in by
the outer door HOVSTAD gets up What youhere

Petra Yes you must forgive me

Hovstad pulling a chair forward Wont you sit down

Petra No thank you I must go again in a moment

Hovstad Have you come with a message from your father by any chance

Petra No I have come on my own account Takes a book out of her coat
pocket Here is the English story

Hovstad Why have you brought it back

Petra Because I am not going to translate it

Hovstad But you promised me faithfully

Petra Yes but then I had not read it I dont suppose you have read
it either

Hovstad No you know quite well I dont understand English but

Petra Quite so That is why I wanted to tell you that you must find
something else Lays the book on the table You cant use this for
the Peoples Messenger

Hovstad Why not

Petra Because it conflicts with all your opinions

Hovstad Oh for that matter

Petra You dont understand me The burden of this story is that there
is a supernatural power that looks after the socalled good people in
this world and makes everything happen for the best in their
casewhile all the socalled bad people are punished

Hovstad Well but that is all right That is just what our readers
want

Petra And are you going to be the one to give it to them For myself
I do not believe a word of it You know quite well that things do not
happen so in reality

Hovstad You are perfectly right but an editor cannot always act as he
would prefer He is often obliged to bow to the wishes of the public in
unimportant matters Politics are the most important thing in lifefor
a newspaper anyway and if I want to carry my public with me on the
path that leads to liberty and progress I must not frighten them away
If they find a moral tale of this sort in the serial at the bottom of
the page they will be all the more ready to read what is printed above
it they feel more secure as it were

Petra For shame You would never go and set a snare like that for your
readers you are not a spider

Hovstad smiling Thank you for having such a good opinion of me No
as a matter of fact that is Billings idea and not mine

Petra Billings

Hovstad Yes anyway he propounded that theory here one day And it is
Billing who is so anxious to have that story in the paper I dont know
anything about the book

Petra But how can Billing with his emancipated views

Hovstad Oh Billing is a manysided man He is applying for the post
of secretary to the Bench too I hear

Petra I dont believe it Mr Hovstad How could he possibly bring
himself to do such a thing

Hovstad Ah you must ask him that

Petra I should never have thought it of him

Hovstad looking more closely at her No Does it really surprise you
so much

Petra Yes Or perhaps not altogether Really I dont quite know

Hovstad We journalists are not much worth Miss Stockmann

Petra Do you really mean that

Hovstad I think so sometimes

Petra Yes in the ordinary affairs of everyday life perhaps I can
understand that But now when you have taken a weighty matter in hand

Hovstad This matter of your fathers you mean

Petra Exactly It seems to me that now you must feel you are a man
worth more than most

Hovstad Yes today I do feel something of that sort

Petra Of course you do dont you It is a splendid vocation you have
chosento smooth the way for the march of unappreciated truths and
new and courageous lines of thought If it were nothing more than
because you stand fearlessly in the open and take up the cause of an
injured man

Hovstad Especially when that injured man isahemI dont rightly
know how to

Petra When that man is so upright and so honest you mean

Hovstad more gently Especially when he is your father I meant

Petra suddenly checked That

Hovstad Yes PetraMiss Petra

Petra Is it that that is first and foremost with you Not the matter
itself Not the truthnot my fathers big generous heart

Hovstad Certainlyof coursethat too

Petra No thank you you have betrayed yourself Mr Hovstad and now
I shall never trust you again in anything

Hovstad Can you really take it so amiss in me that it is mostly for
your sake

Petra What I am angry with you for is for not having been honest with
my father You talked to him as if the truth and the good of the
community were what lay nearest to your heart You have made fools of
both my father and me You are not the man you made yourself out to be
And that I shall never forgive younever

Hovstad You ought not to speak so bitterly Miss Petraleast of all
now

Petra Why not now especially

Hovstad Because your father cannot do without my help

Petra looking him up and down Are you that sort of man too For
shame

Hovstad No no I am not This came upon me so unexpectedlyyou must
believe that

Petra I know what to believe Goodbye

Aslaksen coming from the printing room hurriedly and with an air of
mystery Damnation HovstadSees PETRA Oh this is awkward

Petra There is the book you must give it to some one else Goes
towards the door

Hovstad following her But Miss Stockmann

Petra Goodbye Goes out

Aslaksen I sayMr Hovstad

Hovstad Well wellwhat is it

Aslaksen The Mayor is outside in the printing room

Hovstad The Mayor did you say

Aslaksen Yes he wants to speak to you He came in by the back
doordidnt want to be seen you understand

Hovstad What can he want Wait a bitI will go myself Goes to the
door of the printing room opens it bows and invites PETER STOCKMANN
in Just see Aslaksen that no one

Aslaksen Quite so Goes into the printingroom

Peter Stockmann You did not expect to see me here Mr Hovstad

Hovstad No I confess I did not

Peter Stockmann looking round You are very snug in herevery nice
indeed

Hovstad Oh

Peter Stockmann And here I come without any notice to take up your
time

Hovstad By all means Mr Mayor I am at your service But let me
relieve you of yourtakes STOCKMANNs hat and stick and puts them on
a chair Wont you sit down

Peter Stockmann sitting down by the table Thank you HOVSTAD sits
down I have had an extremely annoying experience today Mr Hovstad

Hovstad Really Ah well I expect with all the various business you
have to attend to

Peter Stockmann The Medical Officer of the Baths is responsible for
what happened today

Hovstad Indeed The Doctor

Peter Stockmann He has addressed a kind of report to the Baths
Committee on the subject of certain supposed defects in the Baths

Hovstad Has he indeed

Peter Stockmann Yeshas he not told you I thought he said

Hovstad Ah yesit is true he did mention something about

Aslaksen coming from the printingroom I ought to have that copy

Hovstad angrily Ahemthere it is on the desk

Aslaksen taking it Right

Peter Stockmann But look therethat is the thing I was speaking of

Aslaksen Yes that is the Doctors article Mr Mayor

Hovstad Oh is THAT what you were speaking about

Peter Stockmann Yes that is it What do you think of it

Hovstad Oh I am only a laymanand I have only taken a very cursory
glance at it

Peter Stockmann But you are going to print it

Hovstad I cannot very well refuse a distinguished man

Aslaksen I have nothing to do with editing the paper Mr Mayor

Peter Stockmann I understand

Aslaksen I merely print what is put into my hands

Peter Stockmann Quite so

Aslaksen And so I must moves off towards the printingroom

Peter Stockmann No but wait a moment Mr Aslaksen You will allow
me Mr Hovstad

Hovstad If you please Mr Mayor

Peter Stockmann You are a discreet and thoughtful man Mr Aslaksen

Aslaksen I am delighted to hear you think so sir

Peter Stockmann And a man of very considerable influence

Aslaksen Chiefly among the small tradesmen sir

Peter Stockmann The small taxpayers are the majorityhere as
everywhere else

Aslaksen That is true

Peter Stockmann And I have no doubt you know the general trend of
opinion among them dont you

Aslaksen Yes I think I may say I do Mr Mayor

Peter Stockmann Yes Well since there is such a praiseworthy spirit
of selfsacrifice among the less wealthy citizens of our town

Aslaksen What

Hovstad Selfsacrifice

Peter Stockmann It is pleasing evidence of a publicspirited feeling
extremely pleasing evidence I might almost say I hardly expected it
But you have a closer knowledge of public opinion than I

Aslaksen But Mr Mayor

Peter Stockmann And indeed it is no small sacrifice that the town is
going to make

Hovstad The town

Aslaksen But I dont understand Is it the Baths

Peter Stockmann At a provisional estimate the alterations that the
Medical Officer asserts to be desirable will cost somewhere about
twenty thousand pounds

Aslaksen That is a lot of money but

Peter Stockmann Of course it will be necessary to raise a municipal
loan

Hovstad getting up Surely you never mean that the town must pay

Aslaksen Do you mean that it must come out of the municipal
fundsout of the illfilled pockets of the small tradesmen

Peter Stockmann Well my dear Mr Aslaksen where else is the money to
come from

Aslaksen The gentlemen who own the Baths ought to provide that

Peter Stockmann The proprietors of the Baths are not in a position to
incur any further expense

Aslaksen Is that absolutely certain Mr Mayor

Peter Stockmann I have satisfied myself that it is so If the town
wants these very extensive alterations it will have to pay for them

Aslaksen But damn it allI beg your pardonthis is quite another
matter Mr Hovstad

Hovstad It is indeed

Peter Stockmann The most fatal part of it is that we shall be obliged
to shut the Baths for a couple of years

Hovstad Shut them Shut them altogether

Aslaksen For two years

Peter Stockmann Yes the work will take as long as thatat least

Aslaksen Im damned if we will stand that Mr Mayor What are we
householders to live upon in the meantime

Peter Stockmann Unfortunately that is an extremely difficult question
to answer Mr Aslaksen But what would you have us do Do you suppose
we shall have a single visitor in the town if we go about proclaiming
that our water is polluted that we are living over a plague spot that
the entire town

Aslaksen And the whole thing is merely imagination

Peter Stockmann With the best will in the world I have not been able
to come to any other conclusion

Aslaksen Well then I must say it is absolutely unjustifiable of Dr
StockmannI beg your pardon Mr Mayor

Peter Stockmann What you say is lamentably true Mr Aslaksen My
brother has unfortunately always been a headstrong man

Aslaksen After this do you mean to give him your support Mr Hovstad

Hovstad Can you suppose for a moment that I

Peter Stockmann I have drawn up a short resume of the situation as it
appears from a reasonable mans point of view In it I have indicated
how certain possible defects might suitably be remedied without
outrunning the resources of the Baths Committee

Hovstad Have you got it with you Mr Mayor

Peter Stockmann fumbling in his pocket Yes I brought it with me in
case you should

Aslaksen Good Lord there he is

Peter Stockmann Who My brother

Hovstad Where Where

Aslaksen He has just gone through the printing room

Peter Stockmann How unlucky I dont want to meet him here and I had
still several things to speak to you about

Hovstad pointing to the door on the right Go in there for the
present

Peter Stockmann But

Hovstad You will only find Billing in there

Aslaksen Quick quick Mr Mayorhe is just coming

Peter Stockmann Yes very well but see that you get rid of him
quickly Goes out through the door on the right which ASLAKSEN opens
for him and shuts after him

Hovstad Pretend to be doing something Aslaksen Sits down and
writes ASLAKSEN begins foraging among a heap of newspapers that are
lying on a chair

Dr Stockmann coming in from the printing room Here I am again
Puts down his hat and stick

Hovstad writing Already Doctor Hurry up with what we were speaking
about Aslaksen We are very pressed for time today

Dr Stockmann to ASLAKSEN No proof for me to see yet I hear

Aslaksen without turning round You couldnt expect it yet Doctor

Dr Stockmann No no but I am impatient as you can understand I
shall not know a moments peace of mind until I see it in print

Hovstad HmIt will take a good while yet wont it Aslaksen

Aslaksen Yes I am almost afraid it will

Dr Stockmann All right my dear friends I will come back I do not
mind coming back twice if necessary A matter of such great
importancethe welfare of the town at stakeit is no time to shirk
trouble is just going but stops and comes back Look herethere is
one thing more I want to speak to you about

Hovstad Excuse me but could it not wait till some other time

Dr Stockmann I can tell you in half a dozen words It is only this
When my article is read tomorrow and it is realised that I have been
quietly working the whole winter for the welfare of the town

Hovstad Yes but Doctor

Dr Stockmann I know what you are going to say You dont see how on
earth it was any more than my dutymy obvious duty as a citizen Of
course it wasnt I know that as well as you But my fellow citizens
you know Good Lord think of all the good souls who think so highly
of me

Aslaksen Yes our townsfolk have had a very high opinion of you so
far Doctor

Dr Stockmann Yes and that is just why I am afraid they Well this
is the point when this reaches them especially the poorer classes
and sounds in their ears like a summons to take the towns affairs into
their own hands for the future

Hovstad getting up Ahem Doctor I wont conceal from you the fact

Dr Stockmann Ah II knew there was something in the wind But I
wont hear a word of it If anything of that sort is being set on foot

Hovstad Of what sort

Dr Stockmann Well whatever it iswhether it is a demonstration in
my honour or a banquet or a subscription list for some presentation
to mewhatever it is you most promise me solemnly and faithfully to
put a stop to it You too Mr Aslaksen do you understand

Hovstad You must forgive me Doctor but sooner or later we must tell
you the plain truth

He is interrupted by the entrance Of MRS STOCKMANN who comes in from
the street door

Mrs Stockmann seeing her husband Just as I thought

Hovstad going towards her You too Mrs Stockmann

Dr Stockmann What on earth do you want here Katherine

Mrs Stockmann I should think you know very well what I want

Hovstad Wont you sit down Or perhaps

Mrs Stockmann No thank you dont trouble And you must not be
offended at my coming to fetch my husband I am the mother of three
children you know

Dr Stockmann Nonsensewe know all about that

Mrs Stockmann Well one would not give you credit for much thought
for your wife and children today if you had had that you would not
have gone and dragged us all into misfortune

Dr Stockmann Are you out of your senses Katherine Because a man has
a wife and children is he not to be allowed to proclaim the truthis
he not to be allowed to be an actively useful citizenis he not to be
allowed to do a service to his native town

Mrs Stockmann Yes Thomasin reason

Aslaksen Just what I say Moderation in everything

Mrs Stockmann And that is why you wrong us Mr Hovstad in enticing
my husband away from his home and making a dupe of him in all this

Hovstad I certainly am making a dupe of no one

Dr Stockmann Making a dupe of me Do you suppose I should allow
myself to be duped

Mrs Stockmann It is just what you do I know quite well you have more
brains than anyone in the town but you are extremely easily duped
Thomas To Hovstad Please do realise that he loses his post at the
Baths if you print what he has written

Aslaksen What

Hovstad Look here Doctor

Dr Stockmann laughing Hahajust let them try No nothey will
take good care not to I have got the compact majority behind me let
me tell you

Mrs Stockmann Yes that is just the worst of ityour having any such
horrid thing behind you

Dr Stockmann Rubbish KatherineGo home and look after your house
and leave me to look after the community How can you be so afraid
when I am so confident and happy Walks up and down rubbing his
hands Truth and the People will win the fight you may be certain I
see the whole of the broadminded middle class marching like a
victorious army Stops beside a chair What the deuce is that lying
there

Aslaksen Good Lord

Hovstad Ahem

Dr Stockmann Here we have the topmost pinnacle of authority Takes
the Mayors official hat carefully between his fingertips and holds it
up in the air

Mrs Stockmann The Mayors hat

Dr Stockmann And here is the staff of office too How in the name of
all thats wonderful

Hovstad Well you see

Dr Stockmann Oh I understand He has been here trying to talk you
over Hahahe made rather a mistake there And as soon as he caught
sight of me in the printing room Bursts out laughing Did he run
away Mr Aslaksen

Aslaksen hurriedly Yes he ran away Doctor

Dr Stockmann Ran away without his stick or his Fiddlesticks Peter
doesnt run away and leave his belongings behind him But what the
deuce have you done with him Ahin there of course Now you shall
see Katherine

Mrs Stockmann Thomasplease dont

Aslaksen Dont be rash Doctor

DR STOCKMANN has put on the Mayors hat and taken his stick in his
hand He goes up to the door opens it and stands with his hand to his
hat at the salute PETER STOCKMANN comes in red with anger BILLING
follows him

Peter Stockmann What does this tomfoolery mean

Dr Stockmann Be respectful my good Peter I am the chief authority
in the town now Walks up and down

Mrs Stockmann almost in tears Really Thomas

Peter Stockmann following him about Give me my hat and stick

Dr Stockmann in the same tone as before If you are chief constable
let me tell you that I am the MayorI am the master of the whole town
please understand

Peter Stockmann Take off my hat I tell you Remember it is part of an
official uniform

Dr Stockmann Pooh Do you think the newly awakened lionhearted people
are going to be frightened by an official hat There is going to be a
revolution in the town tomorrow let me tell you You thought you could
turn me out but now I shall turn you outturn you out of all your
various offices Do you think I cannot Listen to me I have triumphant
social forces behind me Hovstad and Billing will thunder in the
Peoples Messenger and Aslaksen will take the field at the head of
the whole Householders Association

Aslaksen That I wont Doctor

Dr Stockmann Of course you will

Peter Stockmann Ahmay I ask then if Mr Hovstad intends to join
this agitation

Hovstad No Mr Mayor

Aslaksen No Mr Hovstad is not such a fool as to go and ruin his
paper and himself for the sake of an imaginary grievance

Dr Stockmann looking round him What does this mean

Hovstad You have represented your case in a false light Doctor and
therefore I am unable to give you my support

Billing And after what the Mayor was so kind as to tell me just now
I

Dr Stockmann A false light Leave that part of it to me Only print
my article I am quite capable of defending it

Hovstad I am not going to print it I cannot and will not and dare not
print it

Dr Stockmann You dare not What nonsenseyou are the editor and an
editor controls his paper I suppose

Aslaksen No it is the subscribers Doctor

Peter Stockmann Fortunately yes

Aslaksen It is public opinionthe enlightened publichouseholders
and people of that kind they control the newspapers

Dr Stockmann composedly And I have all these influences against me

Aslaksen Yes you have It would mean the absolute ruin of the
community if your article were to appear

Dr Stockmann Indeed

Peter Stockmann My hat and stick if you please DR STOCKMANN takes
off the hat and lays it on the table with the stick PETER STOCKMANN
takes them up Your authority as mayor has come to an untimely end

Dr Stockmann We have not got to the end yet To HOVSTAD Then it is
quite impossible for you to print my article in the Peoples
Messenger

Hovstad Quite impossibleout of regard for your family as well

Mrs Stockmann You need not concern yourself about his family thank
you Mr Hovstad

Peter Stockmann taking a paper from his pocket It will be
sufficient for the guidance of the public if this appears It is an
official statement May I trouble you

Hovstad taking the paper Certainly I will see that it is printed

Dr Stockmann But not mine Do you imagine that you can silence me and
stifle the truth You will not find it so easy as you suppose Mr
Aslaksen kindly take my manuscript at once and print it as a
pamphletat my expense I will have four hundred copiesno five or
six hundred

Aslaksen If you offered me its weight in gold I could not lend my
press for any such purpose Doctor It would be flying in the face of
public opinion You will not get it printed anywhere in the town

Dr Stockmann Then give it me back

Hovstad giving him the MS Here it is

Dr Stockmann taking his hat and stick It shall be made public all
the same I will read it out at a mass meeting of the townspeople All
my fellowcitizens shall hear the voice of truth

Peter Stockmann You will not find any public body in the town that
will give you the use of their hall for such a purpose

Aslaksen Not a single one I am certain

Billing No Im damned if you will find one

Mrs Stockmann But this is too shameful Why should every one turn
against you like that

Dr Stockmann angrily I will tell you why It is because all the men
in this town are old womenlike you they all think of nothing but
their families and never of the community

Mrs Stockmann putting her arm into his Then I will show them that
an old woman can be a man for once I am going to stand by you Thomas

Dr Stockmann Bravely said Katherine It shall be made publicas I
am a living soul If I cant hire a hall I shall hire a drum and
parade the town with it and read it at every streetcorner

Peter Stockmann You are surely not such an errant fool as that

Dr Stockmann Yes I am

Aslaksen You wont find a single man in the whole town to go with you

Billing No Im damned if you will

Mrs Stockmann Dont give in Thomas I will tell the boys to go with
you

Dr Stockmann That is a splendid idea

Mrs Stockmann Morten will be delighted and Ejlif will do whatever he
does

Dr Stockmann Yes and Petraand you too Katherine

Mrs Stockmann No I wont do that but I will stand at the window and
watch you thats what I will do

Dr Stockmann puts his arms round her and kisses her Thank you my
dear Now you and I are going to try a fall my fine gentlemen I am
going to see whether a pack of cowards can succeed in gagging a patriot
who wants to purify society He and his wife go out by the street
door

Peter Stockmann shaking his head seriously Now he has sent her out
of her senses too


ACT IV

SCENEA big oldfashioned room in CAPTAIN HORSTERS house At the
back foldingdoors which are standing open lead to an anteroom
Three windows in the lefthand wall In the middle of the opposite wall
a platform has been erected On this is a small table with two candles
a waterbottle and glass and a bell The room is lit by lamps placed
between the windows In the foreground on the left there is a table
with candles and a chair To the right is a door and some chairs
standing near it The room is nearly filled with a crowd of townspeople
of all sorts a few women and schoolboys being amongst them People are
still streaming in from the back and the room is soon filled

1st Citizen meeting another Hullo Lamstad You here too

2nd Citizen I go to every public meeting I do

3rd Citizen Brought your whistle too I expect

2nd Citizen I should think so Havent you

3rd Citizen Rather And old Evensen said he was going to bring a
cowhorn he did

2nd Citizen Good old Evensen Laughter among the crowd

4th Citizen coming up to them I say tell me what is going on here
tonight

2nd Citizen Dr Stockmann is going to deliver an address attacking the
Mayor

4th Citizen But the Mayor is his brother

1st Citizen That doesnt matter Dr Stockmanns not the chap to be
afraid

3rd Citizen But he is in the wrong it said so in the Peoples
Messenger

2nd Citizen Yes I expect he must be in the wrong this time because neither
the Householders Association nor the Citizens Club would lend him
their hall for his meeting

1st Citizen He couldnt even get the loan of the hall at the Baths

2nd Citizen No I should think not

A Man in another part of the crowd I saywho are we to back up in this

Another Man beside him Watch Aslaksen and do as he does

Billing pushing his way through the crowd with a writingcase under his arm
Excuse me gentlemendo you mind letting me through I am reporting for the
Peoples Messenger Thank you very much He sits down at
the table on the left

A Workman Who was that

Second Workman Dont you know him Its Billing who writes for
Aslaksens paper

CAPTAIN HORSTER brings in MRS STOCKMANN and PETRA through the door on the
right EJLIF and MORTEN follow them in

Horster I thought you might all sit here you can slip out easily from here
if things get too lively

Mrs Stockmann Do you think there will be a disturbance

Horster One can never tellwith such a crowd But sit down and dont
be uneasy

Mrs Stockmann sitting down It was extremely kind of you to offer my husband
the room

Horster Well if nobody else would

Petra who has sat down beside her mother And it was a plucky thing to do
Captain Horster

Horster Oh it is not such a great matter as all that

HOVSTAD and ASLAKSEN make their way through the crowd

Aslaksen going up to HORSTER Has the Doctor not come yet

Horster He is waiting in the next room Movement in the crowd by the door
at the back

Hovstad Lookhere comes the Mayor

Billing Yes Im damned if he hasnt come after all

PETER STOCKMANN makes his way gradually through the crowd bows courteously
and takes up a position by the wall on the left Shortly afterwards Dr
STOCKMANN comes in by the righthand door He is dressed in a black
frockcoat with a white tie There is a little feeble applause which is
hushed down Silence is obtained

Dr Stockmann in an undertone How do you feel Katherine

Mrs Stockmann All right thank you Lowering her voice Be sure not to lose
your temper Thomas

Dr Stockmann Oh I know how to control myself

Looks at his watch steps on to the platform and bows It is a quarter
pastso I will begin Takes his MS out of his pocket

Aslaksen I think we ought to elect a chairman first

Dr Stockmann No it is quite unnecessary

Some of the Crowd Yesyes

Peter Stockmann I certainly think too that we ought to have a chairman

Dr Stockmann But I have called this meeting to deliver a lecture Peter

Peter Stockmann Dr Stockmanns lecture may possibly lead to a
considerable conflict of opinion

Voices in the Crowd A chairman A chairman 

Hovstad The general wish of the meeting seems to be that a chairman should be
elected

Dr Stockmann restraining himself Very welllet the meeting have its way

Aslaksen Will the Mayor be good enough to undertake the task 

Three Men clapping their hands Bravo Bravo

Peter Stockmann For various reasons which you will easily understand
I must beg to be excused But fortunately we have amongst us a man who
I think will be acceptable to you all I refer to the President of the
Householders Association Mr Aslaksen

Several voices YesAslaksen Bravo Aslaksen

DR STOCKMANN takes up his MS and walks up and down the platform

Aslaksen Since my fellowcitizens choose to entrust me with this duty
I cannot refuse

Loud applause ASLAKSEN mounts the platform

Billing writing Mr Aslaksen was elected with enthusiasm

Aslaksen And now as I am in this position I should like to say a few
brief words I am a quiet and peaceable man who believes in discreet
moderation andandin moderate discretion All my friends can bear
witness to that

Several Voices Thats right Thats right Aslaksen

Aslaksen I have learned in the school of life and experience that
moderation is the most valuable virtue a citizen can possess

Peter Stockmann Hear hear

Aslaksen And moreover that discretion and moderation are what
enable a man to be of most service to the community I would therefore
suggest to our esteemed fellowcitizen who has called this meeting
that he should strive to keep strictly within the bounds of moderation

A Man by the door Three cheers for the Moderation Society

A Voice Shame

Several Voices ShSh

Aslaksen No interruptions gentlemen please Does anyone wish to make
any remarks

Peter Stockmann Mr Chairman

Aslaksen The Mayor will address the meeting

Peter Stockmann In consideration of the close relationship in which
as you all know I stand to the present Medical Officer of the Baths I
should have preferred not to speak this evening But my official
position with regard to the Baths and my solicitude for the vital
interests of the town compel me to bring forward a motion I venture to
presume that there is not a single one of our citizens present who
considers it desirable that unreliable and exaggerated accounts of the
sanitary condition of the Baths and the town should be spread abroad

Several Voices No no Certainly not We protest against it

Peter Stockmann Therefore I should like to propose that the meeting
should not permit the Medical Officer either to read or to comment on
his proposed lecture

Dr Stockmann impatiently Not permit What the devil

Mrs Stockmann coughing Ahemahem

Dr Stockmann collecting himself Very well Go ahead

Peter Stockmann In my communication to the Peoples Messenger I
have put the essential facts before the public in such a way that every
fairminded citizen can easily form his own opinion From it you will
see that the main result of the Medical Officers proposalsapart from
their constituting a vote of censure on the leading men of the
townwould be to saddle the ratepayers with an unnecessary expenditure
of at least some thousands of pounds

Sounds of disapproval among the audience and some catcalls

Aslaksen ringing his bell Silence please gentlemen I beg to
support the Mayors motion I quite agree with him that there is
something behind this agitation started by the Doctor He talks about
the Baths but it is a revolution he is aiming athe wants to get the
administration of the town put into new hands No one doubts the
honesty of the Doctors intentionsno one will suggest that there can
be any two opinions as to that I myself am a believer in
selfgovernment for the people provided it does not fall too heavily
on the ratepayers But that would be the case here and that is why I
will see Dr Stockmann damnedI beg your pardonbefore I go with him
in the matter You can pay too dearly for a thing sometimes that is my
opinion

Loud applause on all sides

Hovstad I too feel called upon to explain my position Dr
Stockmanns agitation appeared to be gaining a certain amount of
sympathy at first so I supported it as impartially as I could But
presently we had reason to suspect that we had allowed ourselves to be
misled by misrepresentation of the state of affairs

Dr Stockmann Misrepresentation

Hovstad Well let us say a not entirely trustworthy representation
The Mayors statement has proved that I hope no one here has any doubt
as to my liberal principles the attitude of the Peoples Messenger
towards important political questions is well known to everyone But
the advice of experienced and thoughtful men has convinced me that in
purely local matters a newspaper ought to proceed with a certain
caution

Aslaksen I entirely agree with the speaker

Hovstad And in the matter before us it is now an undoubted fact that
Dr Stockmann has public opinion against him Now what is an editors
first and most obvious duty gentlemen Is it not to work in harmony
with his readers Has he not received a sort of tacit mandate to work
persistently and assiduously for the welfare of those whose opinions he
represents Or is it possible I am mistaken in that

Voices from the crowd No no You are quite right

Hovstad It has cost me a severe struggle to break with a man in whose
house I have been lately a frequent guesta man who till today has
been able to pride himself on the undivided goodwill of his
fellowcitizensa man whose only or at all events whose essential
failing is that he is swayed by his heart rather than his head

A few scattered voices That is true Bravo Stockmann

Hovstad But my duty to the community obliged me to break with him And
there is another consideration that impels me to oppose him and as
far as possible to arrest him on the perilous course he has adopted
that is consideration for his family

Dr Stockmann Please stick to the watersupply and drainage

Hovstad consideration I repeat for his wife and his children for
whom he has made no provision

Morten Is that us mother

Mrs Stockmann Hush

Aslaksen I will now put the Mayors proposition to the vote

Dr Stockmann There is no necessity Tonight I have no intention of
dealing with all that filth down at the Baths No I have something
quite different to say to you

Peter Stockmann aside What is coming now

A Drunken Man by the entrance door I am a ratepayer And therefore
I have a right to speak too And my entirefirminconceivable opinion
is

A number of voices Be quiet at the back there

Others He is drunk Turn him out They turn him out

Dr Stockmann Am I allowed to speak

Aslaksen ringing his bell Dr Stockmann will address the meeting

Dr Stockmann I should like to have seen anyone a few days ago dare
to attempt to silence me as has been done tonight I would have
defended my sacred rights as a man like a lion But now it is all one
to me I have something of even weightier importance to say to you
The crowd presses nearer to him MORTEN Kiil conspicuous among them

Dr Stockmann continuing I have thought and pondered a great deal
these last few dayspondered over such a variety of things that in the
end my head seemed too full to hold them

Peter Stockmann with a cough Ahem

Dr Stockmann but I got them clear in my mind at last and then I
saw the whole situation lucidly And that is why I am standing here
tonight I have a great revelation to make to you my fellowcitizens
I will impart to you a discovery of a far wider scope than the trifling
matter that our water supply is poisoned and our medicinal Baths are
standing on pestiferous soil

A number of voices shouting Dont talk about the Baths We wont
hear you None of that

Dr Stockmann I have already told you that what I want to speak about
is the great discovery I have made latelythe discovery that all the
sources of our moral life are poisoned and that the whole fabric of our
civic community is founded on the pestiferous soil of falsehood

Voices of disconcerted Citizens What is that he says

Peter Stockmann Such an insinuation

Aslaksen with his hand on his bell I call upon the speaker to
moderate his language

Dr Stockmann I have always loved my native town as a man only can
love the home of his youthful days I was not old when I went away from
here and exile longing and memories cast as it were an additional
halo over both the town and its inhabitants Some clapping and
applause And there I stayed for many years in a horrible hole far
away up north When I came into contact with some of the people that
lived scattered about among the rocks I often thought it would of been
more service to the poor halfstarved creatures if a veterinary doctor
had been sent up there instead of a man like me Murmurs among the
crowd

Billing laying down his pen Im damned if I have ever heard

Hovstad It is an insult to a respectable population

Dr Stockmann Wait a bit I do not think anyone will charge me with
having forgotten my native town up there I was like one of the
eiderducks brooding on its nest and what I hatched was the plans for
these Baths Applause and protests And then when fate at last
decreed for me the great happiness of coming home againI assure you
gentlemen I thought I had nothing more in the world to wish for Or
rather there was one thing I wished foreagerly untiringly
ardentlyand that was to be able to be of service to my native town
and the good of the community

Peter Stockmann looking at the ceiling You chose a strange way of
doing itahem

Dr Stockmann And so with my eyes blinded to the real facts I
revelled in happiness But yesterday morningno to be precise it was
yesterday afternoonthe eyes of my mind were opened wide and the
first thing I realised was the colossal stupidity of the authorities
Uproar shouts and laughter MRS STOCKMANN coughs persistently

Peter Stockmann Mr Chairman

Aslaksen ringing his bell By virtue of my authority

Dr Stockmann It is a petty thing to catch me up on a word Mr
Aslaksen What I mean is only that I got scent of the unbelievable
piggishness our leading men had been responsible for down at the Baths
I cant stand leading men at any priceI have had enough of such
people in my time They are like billygoats on a young plantation
they do mischief everywhere They stand in a free mans way whichever
way he turns and what I should like best would be to see them
exterminated like any other vermin Uproar

Peter Stockmann Mr Chairman can we allow such expressions to pass

Aslaksen with his hand on his bell Doctor

Dr Stockmann I cannot understand how it is that I have only now
acquired a clear conception of what these gentry are when I had almost
daily before my eyes in this town such an excellent specimen of
themmy brother Peterslowwitted and hidebound in prejudice
Laughter uproar and hisses MRS STOCKMANN Sits coughing assiduously
ASLAKSEN rings his bell violently

The Drunken Man who has got in again Is it me he is talking about
My names Petersen all rightbut devil take me if I

Angry Voices Turn out that drunken man Turn him out He is turned
out again

Peter Stockmann Who was that person

1st Citizen I dont know who he is Mr Mayor

2nd Citizen He doesnt belong here

3rd Citizen I expect he is a navvy from over atthe rest is
inaudible

Aslaksen He had obviously had too much beer Proceed Doctor but
please strive to be moderate in your language

Dr Stockmann Very well gentlemen I will say no more about our
leading men And if anyone imagines from what I have just said that
my object is to attack these people this evening he is
wrongabsolutely wide of the mark For I cherish the comforting
conviction that these parasitesall these venerable relics of a dying
school of thoughtare most admirably paving the way for their own
extinction they need no doctors help to hasten their end Nor is it
folk of that kind who constitute the most pressing danger to the
community It is not they who are most instrumental in poisoning the
sources of our moral life and infecting the ground on which we stand
It is not they who are the most dangerous enemies of truth and freedom
amongst us

Shouts from all sides Who then Who is it Name Name

Dr Stockmann You may depend upon itI shall name them That is
precisely the great discovery I made yesterday Raises his voice The
most dangerous enemy of truth and freedom amongst us is the compact
majorityyes the damned compact Liberal majoritythat is it Now you
know Tremendous uproar Most of the crowd are shouting stamping and
hissing Some of the older men among them exchange stolen glances and
seem to be enjoying themselves MRS STOCKMANN gets up looking
anxious EJLIF and MORTEN advance threateningly upon some schoolboys
who are playing pranks ASLAKSEN rings his bell and begs for silence
HOVSTAD and BILLING both talk at once but are inaudible At last quiet
is restored

Aslaksen As Chairman I call upon the speaker to withdraw the
illconsidered expressions he has just used

Dr Stockmann Never Mr Aslaksen It is the majority in our community
that denies me my freedom and seeks to prevent my speaking the truth

Hovstad The majority always has right on its side

Billing And truth too by God

Dr Stockmann The majority never has right on its side Never I say
That is one of these social lies against which an independent
intelligent man must wage war Who is it that constitute the majority
of the population in a country Is it the clever folk or the stupid I
dont imagine you will dispute the fact that at present the stupid
people are in an absolutely overwhelming majority all the world over
But good Lordyou can never pretend that it is right that the stupid
folk should govern the clever ones Uproar and cries Oh yesyou
can shout me down I know But you cannot answer me The majority has
might on its sideunfortunately but right it has not I am in the
rightI and a few other scattered individuals The minority is always
in the right Renewed uproar

Hovstad Ahaso Dr Stockmann has become an aristocrat since the day
before yesterday

Dr Stockmann I have already said that I dont intend to waste a word
on the puny narrowchested shortwinded crew whom we are leaving
astern Pulsating life no longer concerns itself with them I am
thinking of the few the scattered few amongst us who have absorbed
new and vigorous truths Such men stand as it were at the outposts
so far ahead that the compact majority has not yet been able to come up
with them and there they are fighting for truths that are too
newlyborn into the world of consciousness to have any considerable
number of people on their side as yet

Hovstad So the Doctor is a revolutionary now

Dr Stockmann Good heavensof course I am Mr Hovstad I propose to
raise a revolution against the lie that the majority has the monopoly
of the truth What sort of truths are they that the majority usually
supports They are truths that are of such advanced age that they are
beginning to break up And if a truth is as old as that it is also in
a fair way to become a lie gentlemen Laughter and mocking cries
Yes believe me or not as you like but truths are by no means as
longlived at Methuselahas some folk imagine A normally constituted
truth lives let us say as a rule seventeen or eighteen or at most
twenty yearsseldom longer But truths as aged as that are always worn
frightfully thin and nevertheless it is only then that the majority
recognises them and recommends them to the community as wholesome moral
nourishment There is no great nutritive value in that sort of fare I
can assure you and as a doctor I ought to know These majority
truths are like last years cured meatlike rancid tainted ham and
they are the origin of the moral scurvy that is rampant in our
communities

Aslaksen It appears to me that the speaker is wandering a long way
from his subject

Peter Stockmann I quite agree with the Chairman

Dr Stockmann Have you gone clean out of your senses Peter I am
sticking as closely to my subject as I can for my subject is precisely
this that it is the masses the majoritythis infernal compact
majoritythat poisons the sources of our moral life and infects the
ground we stand on

Hovstad And all this because the great broadminded majority of the
people is prudent enough to show deference only to wellascertained and
wellapproved truths

Dr Stockmann Ah my good Mr Hovstad dont talk nonsense about
wellascertained truths The truths of which the masses now approve are
the very truths that the fighters at the outposts held to in the days
of our grandfathers We fighters at the outposts nowadays no longer
approve of them and I do not believe there is any other
wellascertained truth except this that no community can live a
healthy life if it is nourished only on such old marrowless truths

Hovstad But instead of standing there using vague generalities it
would be interesting if you would tell us what these old marrowless
truths are that we are nourished on

Applause from many quarters

Dr Stockmann Oh I could give you a whole string of such
abominations but to begin with I will confine myself to one
wellapproved truth which at bottom is a foul lie but upon which
nevertheless Mr Hovstad and the Peoples Messenger and all the
Messengers supporters are nourished

Hovstad And that is

Dr Stockmann That is the doctrine you have inherited from your
forefathers and proclaim thoughtlessly far and widethe doctrine that
the public the crowd the masses are the essential part of the
populationthat they constitute the Peoplethat the common folk the
ignorant and incomplete element in the community have the same right
to pronounce judgment and to approve to direct and to govern as the
isolated intellectually superior personalities in it

Billing Well damn me if ever I

Hovstad at the same time shouting out Fellowcitizens take good
note of that

A number of voices angrily Ohowe are not the People Only the
superior folk are to govern are they

A Workman Turn the fellow out for talking such rubbish

Another Out with him

Another calling out Blow your horn Evensen

A horn is blown loudly amidst hisses and an angry uproar

Dr Stockmann when the noise has somewhat abated Be reasonable
Cant you stand hearing the voice of truth for once I dont in the
least expect you to agree with me all at once but I must say I did
expect Mr Hovstad to admit I was right when he had recovered his
composure a little He claims to be a freethinker

Voices in murmurs of astonishment Freethinker did he say Is
Hovstad a freethinker

Hovstad shouting Prove it Dr Stockmann When have I said so in
print

Dr Stockmann reflecting No confound it you are rightyou have
never had the courage to Well I wont put you in a hole Mr Hovstad
Let us say it is I that am the freethinker then I am going to prove
to you scientifically that the Peoples Messenger leads you by the
nose in a shameful manner when it tells you that youthat the common
people the crowd the masses are the real essence of the People That
is only a newspaper lie I tell you The common people are nothing more
than the raw material of which a People is made Groans laughter and
uproar Well isnt that the case Isnt there an enormous difference
between a wellbred and an illbred strain of animals Take for
instance a common barndoor hen What sort of eating do you get from a
shrivelled up old scrag of a fowl like that Not much do you And what
sort of eggs does it lay A fairly good crow or a raven can lay pretty
nearly as good an egg But take a wellbred Spanish or Japanese hen or
a good pheasant or a turkeythen you will see the difference Or take
the case of dogs with whom we humans are on such intimate terms Think
first of an ordinary common curI mean one of the horrible
coarsehaired lowbred curs that do nothing but run about the streets
and befoul the walls of the houses Compare one of these curs with a
poodle whose sires for many generations have been bred in a gentlemans
house where they have had the best of food and had the opportunity of
hearing soft voices and music Do you not think that the poodles brain
is developed to quite a different degree from that of the cur Of
course it is It is puppies of wellbred poodles like that that
showmen train to do incredibly clever tricksthings that a common cur
could never learn to do even if it stood on its head Uproar and
mocking cries

A Citizen calls out Are you going to make out we are dogs now

Another Citizen We are not animals Doctor

Dr Stockmann Yes but bless my soul we are my friend It is true we
are the finest animals anyone could wish for but even among us
exceptionally fine animals are rare There is a tremendous difference
between poodlemen and curmen And the amusing part of it is that Mr
Hovstad quite agrees with me as long as it is a question of fourfooted
animals

Hovstad Yes it is true enough as far as they are concerned

Dr Stockmann Very well But as soon as I extend the principle and
apply it to twolegged animals Mr Hovstad stops short He no longer
dares to think independently or to pursue his ideas to their logical
conclusion so he turns the whole theory upside down and proclaims in
the Peoples Messenger that it is the barndoor hens and street curs
that are the finest specimens in the menagerie But that is always the
way as long as a man retains the traces of common origin and has not
worked his way up to intellectual distinction

Hovstad I lay no claim to any sort of distinction I am the son of
humble countryfolk and I am proud that the stock I come from is
rooted deep among the common people he insults

Voices Bravo Hovstad Bravo Bravo

Dr Stockmann The kind of common people I mean are not only to be
found low down in the social scale they crawl and swarm all around
useven in the highest social positions You have only to look at your
own fine distinguished Mayor My brother Peter is every bit as
plebeian as anyone that walks in two shoes laughter and hisses

Peter Stockmann I protest against personal allusions of this kind

Dr Stockmann imperturbablyand that not because he is like
myself descended from some old rascal of a pirate from Pomerania or
thereaboutsbecause that is who we are descended from

Peter Stockmann An absurd legend I deny it

Dr Stockmann but because he thinks what his superiors think and
holds the same opinions as they People who do that are intellectually
speaking common people and that is why my magnificent brother Peter
is in reality so very far from any distinctionand consequently also
so far from being liberalminded

Peter Stockmann Mr Chairman

Hovstad So it is only the distinguished men that are liberalminded in
this country We are learning something quite new Laughter

Dr Stockmann Yes that is part of my new discovery too And another
part of it is that broadmindedness is almost precisely the same thing
as morality That is why I maintain that it is absolutely inexcusable
in the Peoples Messenger to proclaim day in and day out the false
doctrine that it is the masses the crowd the compact majority that
have the monopoly of broadmindedness and moralityand that vice and
corruption and every kind of intellectual depravity are the result of
culture just as all the filth that is draining into our Baths is the
result of the tanneries up at Molledal Uproar and interruptions DR
STOCKMANN is undisturbed and goes on carried away by his ardour with
a smile And yet this same Peoples Messenger can go on preaching
that the masses ought to be elevated to higher conditions of life But
bless my soul if the Messengers teaching is to be depended upon
this very raising up the masses would mean nothing more or less than
setting them straightway upon the paths of depravity Happily the
theory that culture demoralises is only an old falsehood that our
forefathers believed in and we have inherited No it is ignorance
poverty ugly conditions of life that do the devils work In a house
which does not get aired and swept every daymy wife Katherine
maintains that the floor ought to be scrubbed as well but that is a
debatable questionin such a house let me tell you people will lose
within two or three years the power of thinking or acting in a moral
manner Lack of oxygen weakens the conscience And there must be a
plentiful lack of oxygen in very many houses in this town I should
think judging from the fact that the whole compact majority can be
unconscientious enough to wish to build the towns prosperity on a
quagmire of falsehood and deceit

Aslaksen We cannot allow such a grave accusation to be flung at a
citizen community

A Citizen I move that the Chairman direct the speaker to sit down

Voices angrily Hear hear Quite right Make him sit down

Dr Stockmann losing his selfcontrol Then I will go and shout the
truth at every street corner I will write it in other towns
newspapers The whole country shall know what is going on here

Hovstad It almost seems as if Dr Stockmanns intention were to ruin
the town

Dr Stockmann Yes my native town is so dear to me that I would rather
ruin it than see it flourishing upon a lie

Aslaksen This is really serious Uproar and catcalls MRS STOCKMANN
coughs but to no purpose her husband does not listen to her any
longer

Hovstad shouting above the din A man must be a public enemy to wish
to ruin a whole community

Dr Stockmann with growing fervor What does the destruction of a
community matter if it lives on lies It ought to be razed to the
ground I tell you All who live by lies ought to be exterminated like
vermin You will end by infecting the whole country you will bring
about such a state of things that the whole country will deserve to be
ruined And if things come to that pass I shall say from the bottom of
my heart Let the whole country perish let all these people be
exterminated

Voices from the crowd That is talking like an outandout enemy of the
people

Billing There sounded the voice of the people by all thats holy

The whole crowd shouting Yes yes He is an enemy of the people He
hates his country He hates his own people

Aslaksen Both as a citizen and as an individual I am profoundly
disturbed by what we have had to listen to Dr Stockmann has shown
himself in a light I should never have dreamed of I am unhappily
obliged to subscribe to the opinion which I have just heard my
estimable fellowcitizens utter and I propose that we should give
expression to that opinion in a resolution I propose a resolution as
follows This meeting declares that it considers Dr Thomas Stockmann
Medical Officer of the Baths to be an enemy of the people A storm
of cheers and applause A number of men surround the DOCTOR and hiss
him MRS STOCKMANN and PETRA have got up from their seats MORTEN and
EJLIF are fighting the other schoolboys for hissing some of their
elders separate them

Dr Stockmann to the men who are hissing him Oh you fools I tell
you that

Aslaksen ringing his bell We cannot hear you now Doctor A formal
vote is about to be taken but out of regard for personal feelings it
shall be by ballot and not verbal Have you any clean paper Mr
Billing

Billing I have both blue and white here

Aslaksen going to him That will do nicely we shall get on more
quickly that way Cut it up into small stripsyes thats it To the
meeting Blue means no white means yes I will come round myself and
collect votes PETER STOCKMANN leaves the hall ASLAKSEN and one or
two others go round the room with the slips of paper in their hats

1st Citizen to HOVSTAD I say what has come to the Doctor What are
we to think of it

Hovstad Oh you know how headstrong he is

2nd Citizen to BILLING Billing you go to their househave you ever
noticed if the fellow drinks

Billing Well Im hanged if I know what to say There are always
spirits on the table when you go

3rd Citizen I rather think he goes quite off his head sometimes

1st Citizen I wonder if there is any madness in his family

Billing I shouldnt wonder if there were

4th Citizen No it is nothing more than sheer malice he wants to get
even with somebody for something or other

Billing Well certainly he suggested a rise in his salary on one
occasion lately and did not get it

The Citizens together Ahthen it is easy to understand how it is

The Drunken Man who has got among the audience again I want a blue
one I do And I want a white one too

Voices Its that drunken chap again Turn him out

Morten Kiil going up to DR STOCKMANN Well Stockmann do you see
what these monkey tricks of yours lead to

Dr Stockmann I have done my duty

Morten Kiil What was that you said about the tanneries at Molledal

Dr Stockmann You heard well enough I said they were the source of
all the filth

Morten Kiil My tannery too

Dr Stockmann Unfortunately your tannery is by far the worst

Morten Kiil Are you going to put that in the papers

Dr Stockmann I shall conceal nothing

Morten Kiil That may cost you dearly Stockmann Goes out

A Stout Man going UP to CAPTAIN HORSTER Without taking any notice of
the ladies Well Captain so you lend your house to enemies of the
people

Horster I imagine I can do what I like with my own possessions Mr
Vik

The Stout Man Then you can have no objection to my doing the same with

ACT V

SCENEDR STOCKMANNS study Bookcases and cabinets containing
specimens line the walls At the back is a door leading to the hall
in the foreground on the left a door leading to the sittingroom In
the righthand wall are two windows of which all the panes are broken
The DOCTORS desk littered with books and papers stands in the middle
of the room which is in disorder It is morning DR STOCKMANN in
dressinggown slippers and a smokingcap is bending down and raking
with an umbrella under one of the cabinets After a little while he
rakes out a stone

Dr Stockmann calling through the open sittingroom door Katherine
I have found another one

Mrs Stockmann from the sittingroom Oh you will find a lot more
yet I expect

Dr Stockmann adding the stone to a heap of others on the table I
shall treasure these stones as relics Ejlif and Morten shall look at
them every day and when they are grown up they shall inherit them as
heirlooms Rakes about under a bookcase Hasntwhat the deuce is
her namethe girl you knowhasnt she been to fetch the glazier yet

Mrs Stockmann coming in Yes but he said he didnt know if he would
be able to come today

Dr Stockmann You will see he wont dare to come

Mrs Stockmann Well that is just what Randine thoughtthat he didnt
dare to on account of the neighbours Calls into the sittingroom
What is it you want Randine Give it to me Goes in and comes out
again directly Here is a letter for you Thomas

Dr Stockmann Let me see it Opens and reads it Ahof course

Mrs Stockmann Who is it from

Dr Stockmann From the landlord Notice to quit

Mrs Stockmann Is it possible Such a nice man

Dr Stockmann looking at the letter Does not dare do otherwise he
says Doesnt like doing it but dare not do otherwiseon account of
his fellowcitizensout of regard for public opinion Is in a
dependent positiondares not offend certain influential men

Mrs Stockmann There you see Thomas

Dr Stockmann Yes yes I see well enough the whole lot of them in
the town are cowards not a man among them dares do anything for fear
of the others Throws the letter on to the table But it doesnt
matter to us Katherine We are going to sail away to the New World
and

Mrs Stockmann But Thomas are you sure we are well advised to take
this step

Dr Stockmann Are you suggesting that I should stay here where they
have pilloried me as an enemy of the peoplebranded mebroken my
windows And just look here Katherinethey have torn a great rent in
my black trousers too

Mrs Stockmann Oh dearand they are the best pair you have got

Dr Stockmann You should never wear your best trousers when you go out
to fight for freedom and truth It is not that I care so much about the
trousers you know you can always sew them up again for me But that
the common herd should dare to make this attack on me as if they were
my equalsthat is what I cannot for the life of me swallow

Mrs Stockmann There is no doubt they have behaved very ill toward
you Thomas but is that sufficient reason for our leaving our native
country for good and all

Dr Stockmann If we went to another town do you suppose we should not
find the common people just as insolent as they are here Depend upon
it there is not much to choose between them Oh well let the curs
snapthat is not the worst part of it The worst is that from one end
of this country to the other every man is the slave of his Party
Although as far as that goes I daresay it is not much better in the
free West either the compact majority and liberal public opinion and
all that infernal old bag of tricks are probably rampant there too But
there things are done on a larger scale you see They may kill you
but they wont put you to death by slow torture They dont squeeze a
free mans soul in a vice as they do here And if need be one can
live in solitude Walks up and down If only I knew where there was a
virgin forest or a small South Sea island for sale cheap

Mrs Stockmann But think of the boys Thomas

Dr Stockmann standing still What a strange woman you are
Katherine Would you prefer to have the boys grow up in a society like
this You saw for yourself last night that half the population are out
of their minds and if the other half have not lost their senses it is
because they are mere brutes with no sense to lose

Mrs Stockmann But Thomas dear the imprudent things you said had
something to do with it you know

Dr Stockmann Well isnt what I said perfectly true Dont they turn
every idea topsyturvy Dont they make a regular hotchpotch of right
and wrong Dont they say that the things I know are true are lies
The craziest part of it all is the fact of these liberals men of
full age going about in crowds imagining that they are the
broadminded party Did you ever hear anything like it Katherine

Mrs Stockmann Yes yes its mad enough of them certainly
butPETRA comes in from the sittingroom Back from school already

Petra Yes I have been given notice of dismissal

Mrs Stockmann Dismissal

Dr Stockmann You too

Petra Mrs Busk gave me my notice so I thought it was best to go at
once

Dr Stockmann You were perfectly right too

Mrs Stockmann Who would have thought Mrs Busk was a woman like that

Petra Mrs Busk isnt a bit like that mother I saw quite plainly how
it hurt her to do it But she didnt dare do otherwise she said and
so I got my notice

Dr Stockmann laughing and rubbing his hands She didnt dare do
otherwise either Its delicious

Mrs Stockmann Well after the dreadful scenes last night

Petra It was not only that Just listen to this father

Dr Stockmann Well

Petra Mrs Busk showed me no less than three letters she received this
morning

Dr Stockmann Anonymous I suppose

Petra Yes

Dr Stockmann Yes because they didnt dare to risk signing their
names Katherine

Petra And two of them were to the effect that a man who has been our
guest here was declaring last night at the Club that my views on
various subjects are extremely emancipated

Dr Stockmann You did not deny that I hope

Petra No you know I wouldnt Mrs Busks own views are tolerably
emancipated when we are alone together but now that this report about
me is being spread she dare not keep me on any longer

Mrs Stockmann And someone who had been a guest of ours That shows
you the return you get for your hospitality Thomas

Dr Stockmann We wont live in such a disgusting hole any longer Pack
up as quickly as you can Katherine the sooner we can get away the
better

Mrs Stockmann Be quietI think I hear someone in the hall See who
it is Petra

Petra opening the door Oh its you Captain Horster Do come in

Horster coming in Good morning I thought I would just come in and
see how you were

Dr Stockmann shaking his hand Thanksthat is really kind of you

Mrs Stockmann And thank you too for helping us through the crowd
Captain Horster

Petra How did you manage to get home again

Horster Oh somehow or other I am fairly strong and there is more
sound than fury about these folk

Dr Stockmann Yes isnt their swinish cowardice astonishing Look
here I will show you something There are all the stones they have
thrown through my windows Just look at them Im hanged if there are
more than two decently large bits of hard stone in the whole heap the
rest are nothing but gravelwretched little things And yet they stood
out there bawling and swearing that they would do me some violence but
as for doing anythingyou dont see much of that in this town

Horster Just as well for you this time doctor

Dr Stockmann True enough But it makes one angry all the same
because if some day it should be a question of a national fight in real
earnest you will see that public opinion will be in favour of taking
to ones heels and the compact majority will turn tail like a flock of
sheep Captain Horster That is what is so mournful to think of it
gives me so much concern that No devil take it it is ridiculous
to care about it They have called me an enemy of the people so an
enemy of the people let me be

Mrs Stockmann You will never be that Thomas

Dr Stockmann Dont swear to that Katherine To be called an ugly
name may have the same effect as a pinscratch in the lung And that
hateful nameI cant get quit of it It is sticking here in the pit of
my stomach eating into me like a corrosive acid And no magnesia will
remove it

Petra Bahyou should only laugh at them father

Horster They will change their minds some day Doctor

Mrs Stockmann Yes Thomas as sure as you are standing here

Dr Stockmann Perhaps when it is too late Much good may it do them
They may wallow in their filth then and rue the day when they drove a
patriot into exile When do you sail Captain Horster

Horster Hmthat was just what I had come to speak about

Dr Stockmann Why has anything gone wrong with the ship

Horster No but what has happened is that I am not to sail in it

Petra Do you mean that you have been dismissed from your command

Horster smiling Yes thats just it

Petra You too

Mrs Stockmann There you see Thomas

Dr Stockmann And that for the truths sake Oh if I had thought such
a thing possible

Horster You mustnt take it to heart I shall be sure to find a job
with some shipowner or other elsewhere

Dr Stockmann And that is this man Vika wealthy man independent of
everyone and everything Shame on him

Horster He is quite an excellent fellow otherwise he told me himself
he would willingly have kept me on if only he had dared

Dr Stockmann But he didnt dare No of course not

Horster It is not such an easy matter he said for a party man

Dr Stockmann The worthy man spoke the truth A party is like a
sausage machine it mashes up all sorts of heads together into the same
mincemeatfatheads and blockheads all in one mash

Mrs Stockmann Come come Thomas dear

Petra to HORSTER If only you had not come home with us things might
not have come to this pass

Horster I do not regret it

Petra holding out her hand to him Thank you for that

Horster to DR STOCKMANN And so what I came to say was that if you
are determined to go away I have thought of another plan

Dr Stockmann Thats splendidif only we can get away at once

Mrs Stockmann Hushwasnt that some one knocking

Petra That is uncle surely

Dr Stockmann Aha Calls out Come in

Mrs Stockmann Dear Thomas promise me definitely PETER STOCKMANN
comes in from the hall

Peter Stockmann Oh you are engaged In that case I will

Dr Stockmann No no come in

Peter Stockmann But I wanted to speak to you alone

Mrs Stockmann We will go into the sittingroom in the meanwhile

Horster And I will look in again later

Dr Stockmann No go in there with them Captain Horster I want to
hear more about

Horster Very well I will wait then He follows MRS STOCKMANN and
PETRA into the sittingroom

Dr Stockmann I daresay you find it rather draughty here today Put
your hat on

Peter Stockmann Thank you if I may Does so I think I caught cold
last night I stood and shivered

Dr Stockmann Really I found it warm enough

Peter Stockmann I regret that it was not in my power to prevent those
excesses last night

Dr Stockmann Have you anything in particular to say to me besides
that

Peter Stockmann taking a big letter from his pocket I have this
document for you from the Baths Committee

Dr Stockmann My dismissal

Peter Stockmann Yes dating from today Lays the letter on the
table It gives us pain to do it but to speak frankly we dared not
do otherwise on account of public opinion

Dr Stockmann smiling Dared not I seem to have heard that word
before today

Peter Stockmann I must beg you to understand your position clearly
For the future you must not count on any practice whatever in the town

Dr Stockmann Devil take the practice But why are you so sure of that

Peter Stockmann The Householders Association is circulating a list
from house to house All rightminded citizens are being called upon to
give up employing you and I can assure you that not a single head of a
family will risk refusing his signature They simply dare not

Dr Stockmann No no I dont doubt it But what then

Peter Stockmann If I might advise you it would be best to leave the
place for a little while

Dr Stockmann Yes the propriety of leaving the place has occurred to
me

Peter Stockmann Good And then when you have had six months to think
things over if after mature consideration you can persuade yourself
to write a few words of regret acknowledging your error

Dr Stockmann I might have my appointment restored to me do you mean

Peter Stockmann Perhaps It is not at all impossible

Dr Stockmann But what about public opinion then Surely you would
not dare to do it on account of public feeling

Peter Stockmann Public opinion is an extremely mutable thing And to
be quite candid with you it is a matter of great importance to us to
have some admission of that sort from you in writing

Dr Stockmann Oh thats what you are after is it I will just
trouble you to remember what I said to you lately about foxy tricks of
that sort

Peter Stockmann Your position was quite different then At that time
you had reason to suppose you had the whole town at your back

Dr Stockmann Yes and now I feel I have the whole town ON my
backflaring up I would not do it if I had the devil and his dam on
my back Nevernever I tell you

Peter Stockmann A man with a family has no right to behave as you do
You have no right to do it Thomas

Dr Stockmann I have no right There is only one single thing in the
world a free man has no right to do Do you know what that is

Peter Stockmann No

Dr Stockmann Of course you dont but I will tell you A free man has
no right to soil himself with filth he has no right to behave in a way
that would justify his spitting in his own face

Peter Stockmann This sort of thing sounds extremely plausible of
course and if there were no other explanation for your obstinacy
But as it happens that there is

Dr Stockmann What do you mean

Peter Stockmann You understand very well what I mean But as your
brother and as a man of discretion I advise you not to build too much
upon expectations and prospects that may so very easily fail you

Dr Stockmann What in the world is all this about

Peter Stockmann Do you really ask me to believe that you are ignorant
of the terms of Mr Kiils will

Dr Stockmann I know that the small amount he possesses is to go to an
institution for indigent old workpeople How does that concern me

Peter Stockmann In the first place it is by no means a small amount
that is in question Mr Kiil is a fairly wealthy man

Dr Stockmann I had no notion of that

Peter Stockmann Hmhadnt you really Then I suppose you had no
notion either that a considerable portion of his wealth will come to
your children you and your wife having a liferent of the capital Has
he never told you so

Dr Stockmann Never on my honour Quite the reverse he has
consistently done nothing but fume at being so unconscionably heavily
taxed But are you perfectly certain of this Peter

Peter Stockmann I have it from an absolutely reliable source

Dr Stockmann Then thank God Katherine is provided forand the
children too I must tell her this at oncecalls out Katherine
Katherine

Peter Stockmann restraining him Hush dont say a word yet

Mrs Stockmann opening the door What is the matter

Dr Stockmann Oh nothing nothing you can go back She shuts the
door DR STOCKMANN walks up and down in his excitement Provided
forJust think of it we are all provided for And for life What a
blessed feeling it is to know one is provided for

Peter Stockmann Yes but that is just exactly what you are not Mr
Kiil can alter his will any day he likes

Dr Stockmann But he wont do that my dear Peter The Badger is
much too delighted at my attack on you and your wise friends

Peter Stockmann starts and looks intently at him Ah that throws a
light on various things

Dr Stockmann What things

Peter Stockmann I see that the whole thing was a combined manoeuvre on
your part and his These violent reckless attacks that you have made
against the leading men of the town under the pretence that it was in
the name of truth

Dr Stockmann What about them

Peter Stockmann I see that they were nothing else than the stipulated
price for that vindictive old mans will

Dr Stockmann almost speechless Peteryou are the most disgusting
plebeian I have ever met in all my life

Peter Stockmann All is over between us Your dismissal is
irrevocablewe have a weapon against you now Goes out

Dr Stockmann For shame For shame Calls out Katherine you must
have the floor scrubbed after him Letwhats her namedevil take it
the girl who has always got soot on her nose

Mrs Stockmann in the sittingroom Hush Thomas be quiet

Petra coming to the door Father grandfather is here asking if he
may speak to you alone

Dr Stockmann Certainly he may Going to the door Come in Mr
Kiil MORTEN KIIL comes in DR STOCKMANN shuts the door after him
What can I do for you Wont you sit down

Morten Kiil I wont sit Looks around You look very comfortable
here today Thomas

Dr Stockmann Yes dont we

Morten Kiil Very comfortableplenty of fresh air I should think you
have got enough today of that oxygen you were talking about yesterday
Your conscience must be in splendid order today I should think

Dr Stockmann It is

Morten Kiil So I should think Taps his chest Do you know what I
have got here

Dr Stockmann A good conscience too I hope

Morten Kiil BahNo it is something better than that He takes a
thick pocketbook from his breastpocket opens it and displays a
packet of papers

Dr Stockmann looking at him in astonishment Shares in the Baths

Morten Kiil They were not difficult to get today

Dr Stockmann And you have been buying

Morten Kiil As many as I could pay for

Dr Stockmann But my dear Mr Kiilconsider the state of the Baths
affairs

Morten Kiil If you behave like a reasonable man you can soon set the
Baths on their feet again

Dr Stockmann Well you can see for yourself that I have done all I
can but They are all mad in this town

Morten Kiil You said yesterday that the worst of this pollution came
from my tannery If that is true then my grandfather and my father
before me and I myself for many years past have been poisoning the
town like three destroying angels Do you think I am going to sit quiet
under that reproach

Dr Stockmann Unfortunately I am afraid you will have to

Morten Kiil No thank you I am jealous of my name and reputation
They call me the Badger I am told A badger is a kind of pig I
believe but I am not going to give them the right to call me that I
mean to live and die a clean man

Dr Stockmann And how are you going to set about it

Morten Kiil You shall cleanse me Thomas

Dr Stockmann I

Morten Kiil Do you know what money I have bought these shares with
No of course you cant knowbut I will tell you It is the money that
Katherine and Petra and the boys will have when I am gone Because I
have been able to save a little bit after all you know

Dr Stockmann flaring up And you have gone and taken Katherines
money for this

Morten Kiil Yes the whole of the money is invested in the Baths now
And now I just want to see whether you are quite stark staring mad
Thomas If you still make out that these animals and other nasty things
of that sort come from my tannery it will be exactly as if you were to
flay broad strips of skin from Katherines body and Petras and the
boys and no decent man would do thatunless he were mad

Dr Stockmann walking up and down Yes but I am mad I am mad

Morten Kiil You cannot be so absurdly mad as all that when it is a
question of your wife and children

Dr Stockmann standing still in front of him Why couldnt you
consult me about it before you went and bought all that trash

Morten Kiil What is done cannot be undone

Dr Stockmann walks about uneasily If only I were not so certain
about it But I am absolutely convinced that I am right

Morten Kiil weighing the pocketbook in his hand If you stick to
your mad idea this wont be worth much you know Puts the
pocketbook in his pocket

Dr Stockmann But hang it all It might be possible for science to
discover some prophylactic I should thinkor some antidote of some
kind

Morten Kiil To kill these animals do you mean

Dr Stockmann Yes or to make them innocuous

Morten Kiil Couldnt you try some ratsbane

Dr Stockmann Dont talk nonsense They all say it is only
imagination you know Well let it go at that Let them have their own
way about it Havent the ignorant narrowminded curs reviled me as an
enemy of the peopleand havent they been ready to tear the clothes
off my back too

Morten Kiil And broken all your windows to pieces

Dr Stockmann And then there is my duty to my family I must talk it
over with Katherine she is great on those things

Morten Kiil That is right be guided by a reasonable womans advice

Dr Stockmann advancing towards him To think you could do such a
preposterous thing Risking Katherines money in this way and putting
me in such a horribly painful dilemma When I look at you I think I
see the devil himself

Morten Kiil Then I had better go But I must have an answer from you
before two oclockyes or no If it is no the shares go to a charity
and that this very day

Dr Stockmann And what does Katherine get

Morten Kiil Not a halfpenny The door leading to the hall opens and
HOVSTAD and ASLAKSEN make their appearance Look at those two

Dr Stockmann staring at them What the devilhave YOU actually the
face to come into my house

Hovstad Certainly

Aslaksen We have something to say to you you see

Morten Kiil in a whisper Yes or nobefore two oclock

Aslaksen glancing at HOVSTAD Aha MORTEN KIIL goes out

Dr Stockmann Well what do you want with me Be brief

Hovstad I can quite understand that you are annoyed with us for our
attitude at the meeting yesterday

Dr Stockmann Attitude do you call it Yes it was a charming
attitude I call it weak womanishdamnably shameful

Hovstad Call it what you like we could not do otherwise

Dr Stockmann You DARED not do otherwiseisnt that it

Hovstad Well if you like to put it that way

Aslaksen But why did you not let us have word of it beforehandjust
a hint to Mr Hovstad or to me

Dr Stockmann A hint Of what

Aslaksen Of what was behind it all

Dr Stockmann I dont understand you in the least

Aslaksen with a confidential nod Oh yes you do Dr Stockmann

Hovstad It is no good making a mystery of it any longer

Dr Stockmann looking first at one of them and then at the other
What the devil do you both mean

Aslaksen May I ask if your fatherinlaw is not going round the town
buying up all the shares in the Baths

Dr Stockmann Yes he has been buying Baths shares today but

Aslaksen It would have been more prudent to get someone else to do
itsomeone less nearly related to you

Hovstad And you should not have let your name appear in the affair
There was no need for anyone to know that the attack on the Baths came
from you You ought to have consulted me Dr Stockmann

Dr Stockmann looks in front of him then a light seems to dawn on him
and he says in amazement Are such things conceivable Are such things
possible

Aslaksen with a smile Evidently they are But it is better to use a
little finesse you know

Hovstad And it is much better to have several persons in a thing of
that sort because the responsibility of each individual is lessened
when there are others with him

Dr Stockmann composedly Come to the point gentlemen What do you
want

Aslaksen Perhaps Mr Hovstad had better

Hovstad No you tell him Aslaksen

Aslaksen Well the fact is that now we know the bearings of the whole
affair we think we might venture to put the Peoples Messenger at
your disposal

Dr Stockmann Do you dare do that now What about public opinion Are
you not afraid of a storm breaking upon our heads

Hovstad We will try to weather it

Aslaksen And you must be ready to go off quickly on a new tack
Doctor As soon as your invective has done its work

Dr Stockmann Do you mean as soon as my fatherinlaw and I have got
hold of the shares at a low figure

Hovstad Your reasons for wishing to get the control of the Baths are
mainly scientific I take it

Dr Stockmann Of course it was for scientific reasons that I
persuaded the old Badger to stand in with me in the matter So we
will tinker at the conduitpipes a little and dig up a little bit of
the shore and it shant cost the town a sixpence That will be all
righteh

Hovstad I think soif you have the Peoples Messenger behind you

Aslaksen The Press is a power in a free community Doctor

Dr Stockmann Quite so And so is public opinion And you Mr
AslaksenI suppose you will be answerable for the Householders
Association

Aslaksen Yes and for the Temperance Society You may rely on that

Dr Stockmann But gentlemenI really am ashamed to ask the
questionbut what return do you

Hovstad We should prefer to help you without any return whatever
believe me But the Peoples Messenger is in rather a shaky
condition it doesnt go really well and I should be very unwilling to
suspend the paper now when there is so much work to do here in the
political way

Dr Stockmann Quite so that would be a great trial to such a friend
of the people as you are Flares up But I am an enemy of the people
remember Walks about the room Where have I put my stick Where the
devil is my stick

Hovstad Whats that

Aslaksen Surely you never mean

Dr Stockmann standing still And suppose I dont give you a single
penny of all I get out of it Money is not very easy to get out of us
rich folk please to remember

Hovstad And you please to remember that this affair of the shares can
be represented in two ways

Dr Stockmann Yes and you are just the man to do it If I dont come
to the rescue of the Peoples Messenger you will certainly take an
evil view of the affair you will hunt me down I can well
imaginepursue metry to throttle me as a dog does a hare

Hovstad It is a natural law every animal must fight for its own
livelihood

Aslaksen And get its food where it can you know

Dr Stockmann walking about the room Then you go and look for yours
in the gutter because I am going to show you which is the strongest
animal of us three Finds an umbrella and brandishes it above his
head Ah now

Hovstad You are surely not going to use violence

Aslaksen Take care what you are doing with that umbrella

Dr Stockmann Out of the window with you Mr Hovstad

Hovstad edging to the door Are you quite mad

Dr Stockmann Out of the window Mr Aslaksen Jump I tell you You
will have to do it sooner or later

Aslaksen running round the writingtable Moderation DoctorI am a
delicate manI can stand so littlecalls out help help

MRS STOCKMANN PETRA and HORSTER come in from the sittingroom

Mrs Stockmann Good gracious Thomas What is happening

Dr Stockmann brandishing the umbrella Jump out I tell you Out
into the gutter

Hovstad An assault on an unoffending man I call you to witness
Captain Horster Hurries out through the hall

Aslaksen irresolutely If only I knew the way about here Steals
out through the sittingroom

Mrs Stockmann holding her husband back Control yourself Thomas

Dr Stockmann throwing down the umbrella Upon my soul they have
escaped after all

Mrs Stockmann What did they want you to do

Dr Stockmann I will tell you later on I have something else to think
about now Goes to the table and writes something on a callingcard
Look there Katherine what is written there

Mrs Stockmann Three big Noes what does that mean

Dr Stockmann I will tell you that too later on Holds out the card
to PETRA There Petra tell sootyface to run over to the Badgers
with that as quick as she can Hurry up PETRA takes the card and
goes out to the hall

Dr Stockmann Well I think I have had a visit from every one of the
devils messengers today But now I am going to sharpen my pen till
they can feel its point I shall dip it in venom and gall I shall hurl
my inkpot at their heads

Mrs Stockmann Yes but we are going away you know Thomas

PETRA comes back

Dr Stockmann Well

Petra She has gone with it

Dr Stockmann GoodGoing away did you say No Ill be hanged if we
are going away We are going to stay where we are Katherine

Petra Stay here

Mrs Stockmann Here in the town

Dr Stockmann Yes here This is the field of battlethis is where
the fight will be This is where I shall triumph As soon as I have had
my trousers sewn up I shall go out and look for another house We must
have a roof over our heads for the winter

Horster That you shall have in my house

Dr Stockmann Can I

Horsier Yes quite well I have plenty of room and I am almost never
at home

Mrs Stockmann How good of you Captain Horster

Petra Thank you

Dr Stockmann grasping his hand Thank you thank you That is one
trouble over Now I can set to work in earnest at once There is an
endless amount of things to look through here Katherine Luckily I
shall have all my time at my disposal because I have been dismissed
from the Baths you know

Mrs Stockmann with a sigh Oh yes I expected that

Dr Stockmann And they want to take my practice away from me too Let
them I have got the poor people to fall back upon anywaythose that
dont pay anything and after all they need me most too But by
Jove they will have to listen to me I shall preach to them in season
and out of season as it says somewhere

Mrs Stockmann But dear Thomas I should have thought events had
showed you what use it is to preach

Dr Stockmann You are really ridiculous Katherine Do you want me to
let myself be beaten off the field by public opinion and the compact
majority and all that devilry No thank you And what I want to do is
so simple and clear and straightforward I only want to drum into the
heads of these curs the fact that the liberals are the most insidious
enemies of freedomthat party programmes strangle every young and
vigorous truththat considerations of expediency turn morality and
justice upside downand that they will end by making life here
unbearable Dont you think Captain Horster that I ought to be able
to make people understand that

Horster Very likely I dont know much about such things myself

Dr Stockmann Well look hereI will explain It is the party leaders
that must be exterminated A party leader is like a wolf you seelike
a voracious wolf He requires a certain number of smaller victims to
prey upon every year if he is to live Just look at Hovstad and
Aslaksen How many smaller victims have they not put an end toor at
any rate maimed and mangled until they are fit for nothing except to be
householders or subscribers to the Peoples Messenger Sits down on
the edge of the table Come here Katherinelook how beautifully the
sun shines today And this lovely spring air I am drinking in

Mrs Stockmann Yes if only we could live on sunshine and spring air
Thomas

Dr Stockmann Oh you will have to pinch and save a bitthen we shall
get along That gives me very little concern What is much worse is
that I know of no one who is liberalminded and highminded enough to
venture to take up my work after me

Petra Dont think about that father you have plenty of time before
youHello here are the boys already
