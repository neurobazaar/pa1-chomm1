CHAPTER 1 TWO MEN AND A WOMAN

Mr Ridgway maam

The young woman who was giving the last touches to the very effective
picture framed in her long lookingglass nodded almost imperceptibly

She had come to the parting of the ways and she knew it with a shrewd
suspicion as to which she would choose She had asked for a week to
decide and her heartsearching had told her nothing new It was
characteristic of Virginia Balfour that she did not attempt to deceive
herself If she married Waring Ridgway it would be for what she
considered good and sufficient reasons but love would not be one of
them He was going to be a great man for one thing and probably a
very rich one which counted though it would not be a determining
factor This she could find only in the man himself in the masterful
force that made him what he was The sandstings of life did not disturb
his confidence in his victorious star nor did he let finespun moral
obligations hamper his predatory career He had a genius for success in
whatever he undertook pushing his way to his end with a shrewd direct
energy that never faltered She sometimes wondered whether she too
like the men he used as tools was merely a pawn in his game and her
consent an empty formality conceded to convention Perhaps he would
marry her even if she did not want to she told herself with the
sudden illuminating smile that was one of her chief charms

But Ridgways wary eyes appraising her mood as she came forward to
meet him read none of this doubt in her frank greeting Anything more
sure and exquisite than the cultivation Virginia Balfour breathed he
would have been hard put to it to conceive That her gown and its
accessories seemed to him merely the extension of a dainty personality
was the highest compliment he could pay her charm and an entirely
unconscious one

Have I kept you waiting she smiled giving him her hand

His answering smile quite cool and unperturbed gave the lie to his
words For a year though the almanac called it a week

You must have suffered she told him ironically with a glance at the
clear color in his goodlooking face

Repressed emotion he explained May I hope that my suffering has
reached a period

They had been sauntering toward a little conservatory at the end of the
large room but she deflected and brought up at a table on which lay
some books One of these she picked up and looked at incuriously for a
moment before sweeping them aside She rested her hands on the table
behind her and leaned back against it her eyes meeting his fairly

Youre still of the same mind are you she demanded

Oh very much

She lifted herself to the table crossing her feet and dangling them
irresponsibly We might as well be comfy while we talk and she
indicated by a nod a chair

Thanks If you dont mind I think Ill take it standing

She did not seem in any hurry to begin and Ridgway gave evidence of no
desire to hasten her But presently he said with a little laugh that
seemed to offer her inclusion in the joke

Im on the anxious seat you knowwaiting to find out whether Im to
be the happiest man alive

You know as much about it as I do She echoed his laugh ruefully
Im still as much at sea as I was last week I couldnt tell then and
I cant now

No news is good news they say

I dont want to marry you a bit but youre a great catch as you are
very well aware

I suppose I am rather a catch he agreed the shadow of a smile at
the corners of his mouth

It isnt only your money though of course thats a temptation she
admitted audaciously

Im glad its not only my money He could laugh with her about it
because he was shrewd enough to understand that it was not at all his
wealth Her cool frankness might have frightened away another man It
merely served to interest Ridgway For with all his strength he was a
vain man always ready to talk of himself He spent a good deal of his
spare time interpreting himself to attractive and attracted young women

Her gaze fastened on the tip of her suede toe apparently studying it
attentively It would be a gratification to my vanity to parade you as
the captive of my bow and spear Youre such a magnificent specimen
such a berserk in broadcloth Still I shant marry you if I can help
itbut then Im not sure that I can help it Of course I disapprove
of you entirely but youre rather fascinating you know Her eye
traveled slowly up to his appraising the masterful lines of his square
figure the dominant strength of his closeshut mouth and resolute
eyes Perhaps fascinating isnt just the word but I cant help
being interested in you whether I like you or not I suppose you
always get what you want very badly she flung out by way of question

Thats what Im trying to discoverhe smiled

There are things to be considered both ways she said taking him
into her confidence You trample on others How do I know you wouldnt
tread on me

That would be one of the risks you would take he agreed impersonally

I shouldnt like that at all If I married you it would be because as
your wife I should have so many opportunities I should expect to do
exactly as I please I shouldnt want you to interfere with me though
I should want to be able to influence you

Nothing could be fairer than that was his amiably ironical comment

You see I dont know younot reallyand they say all sorts of
things about you

They dont say I am a quitter do they

She leaned forward chin in hand and elbow on knee It was a part of
the accent of her distinction that as a rebel she was both demure and
daring I wonder if I might ask you some questionsthe intimate kind
that people think but dont sayat least they dont say them to you

It would be a pleasure to me to be put on the witnessstand I should
probably pick up some interesting sidelights about myself

Very well Her eyes danced with excitement Youre what they call a
buccaneer of business arent you

Here were certainly diverting pastimes I believe I have been called
that but then Ive had the hardest names in the dictionary thrown at
me so often that I cant be sure

I suppose you are perfectly unscrupulous in a business waystop at
nothing to gain your point

He took her impudence smilingly

Unscrupulous isnt the word I use when I explain myself to myself
but as an unflattered description such as one my enemies might use to
describe me I dare say it is fairly accurate

I wonder why Do you dispense with a conscience entirely

Well you see Miss Balfour if I nursed a New England conscience I
could stand up to the attacks of the Consolidated about as long as a
dove to a hawk I meet fire with fire to avoid being wiped off the map
of the mining world I play the game I cant afford to keep a button
on my foil when my opponent doesnt

She nodded an admission of his point And yet there are rules of the
game to be observed arent there The Consolidated people claim you
steal their ore I believe Her slanted eyes studied the effect of her
daring

He laughed grimly Do they I claim they steal mine Its rather
difficult to have an exact regard for mine and thine before the courts
decide which is which

And meanwhile in order to forestall an adverse decision you are
working extra shifts to get all the ore out of the disputed veins

Precisely just as they are he admitted dryly Then the side that
loses will not be so disappointed since the value of the veins will be
less Besides stealing ore openly doesnt count It is really a moral
obligation in a fight like this he explained

A moral obligation

Exactly You cant hit a trust over the head with the decalogue
Modern business is war Somebody is bound to get hurt If I win out it
will be because I put up a better fight than the Consolidated and
cripple it enough to make it let me alone Im looking out for myself
and I dont pretend to be any better than my neighbors When you get
down to bedrock honesty Ive never seen it in business Were all of
us as honest as we think we can afford to be I havent noticed that
there is any premium on it in Mesa Might makes right Ill win if Im
strong enough Ill fail if Im not Thats the law of life I didnt
make this strenuous little world and Im not responsible for it If I
play I have to take the rules the way they are not the way I should
like them to be Im not squeamish and Im not a hypocrite Simon
Harley isnt squeamish either but he happens to be a hypocrite So
there you have the difference between us

The president of the Mesa Oreproducing Company set forth his creed
jauntily without the least consciousness of need for apology for the
fact that it happened to be divorced from morality Its frank disregard
of ethical considerations startled Miss Balfour without shocking her
She liked his candor even though it condemned him It was really very
nice of him to take her impudence so well He certainly wasnt a prig
anyway

And morality she suggested tentatively

hasnt a thing to do with success the parsons to the contrary
notwithstanding The battle is to the strong

Then the Consolidated will beat you finally

He smiled They would if Id let them but brains and resource and
finesse all count for power Granted that they have a hundred dollars
to my one Still I have elements of strength they cant even estimate
David beat Goliath you know even though he didnt do it with a big
stick

So you think morality is for old women

And young women he amended smiling

And every man is to be a law unto himself

Not quite Some men arent big enough to be Let them stick to the
conventional code For me if I make my own laws I dont break them

And youre sure that youre on the road to true success she asked
lightly

Now you have heaven in the back of your mind

Not exactly she laughed But I didnt expect you to understand

Then I wont disappoint you he said cheerfully

She came back to the concrete

I should like to know whether it is true that you own the courts of
Yuba County and have the decisions of the judges written at your
lawyers offices in cases between you and the Consolidated

If I do he answered easily I am doing just what the Consolidated
would do in case they had been so fortunate as to have won the last
election and seated their judicial candidates One expects a friendly
leaning from the men one put in office

Isnt the judiciary supposed to be the final incorruptible bulwark of
the nation she pretended to want to know

I believe it is supposed to be

Isnt it ratherloading the dice to interfere with the courts

I find the dice already loaded I merely substitute others of my own

You dont seem a bit ashamed of yourself

Im ashamed of the Consolidatedhe smiled

Thats a comfortable position to be able to take She fixed him for a
moment with her charming frown of interrogation You wont mind my
asking these questions Im trying to decide whether you are too much
of a pirate for me Perhaps when Ive made up my mind you wont want
me she added

Oh Ill want you Then coolly Shall we wait till you make up your
mind before announcing the engagement

Dont be too sure she flashed at him

Im horribly unsure

Of course youre laughing at me just as you wouldshe tilted a
sudden sideways glance at himif I asked you WHY you wanted to marry
me

Oh if you take me that way

She interrupted airily Im trying to make up my mind whether to take
you at all

You certainly have a direct way of getting at things

He studied appreciatively her piquant tilted face the long graceful
lines of her slender perfect figure I take it you dont want the
sentimental reason for my wishing to marry you though I find that
amply justified But if you want another you must still look to
yourself for it My business leads me to appreciate values correctly
When I desire you to sit at the head of my table to order my house my
judgment justifies itself I have a fancy always for the best When I
cant gratify it I do without

Thank you She made him a gay little mock curtsy I had heard you
were no carpetknight Mr Ridgway But rumor is a lying jade for I am
being toldam I notthat in case I dont take pity on you the lone
future of a celibate stretches drear before you

Oh certainly

Having come to the end of that passage she tried another A young man
told me yesterday you were a fighter He said he guessed you would
stand the acid What did he mean

Ridgway was an egoist from head to heel He could voice his own praises
by the hour when necessary but now he sidestepped her little trap to
make him praise himself at secondhand

Better ask him

ARE you a fighter then

Had he known her and her whimsies less well he might have taken her
audacity for innocence

One couldnt lie down you know

Of course you always fight fair she mocked

When a fellows attacked by a gang of thugs he doesnt pray for
boxinggloves He lets fly with a couplingpin if thats what comes
handy

Her eyes glinting sparks of mischief marveled at him with mock
reverence but she knew in her heart that her mockery was a fraud She
did admire him admired him even while she disapproved the magnificent
lawlessness of him

For Waring Ridgway looked every inch the indomitable fighter he was He
stood six feet to the line straight and strong carrying just
sufficient bulk to temper his restless energy without impairing its
power Nor did the face offer any shock of disappointment to the
promise given by the splendid figure Salientjawed and forceful set
with cool flinty bluegray eyes no place for weakness could be found
there One might have read a moral callousness a colorblindness in
points of rectitude but when the last word had been said its
masterful capability remained the outstanding impression

Am I out of the witnessbox he presently asked still leaning
against the mantel from which he had been watching her impersonally as
an intellectual entertainment

I think so

And the verdict

You know what it ought to be she accused

Fortunately kisses go by favor not by merit

You dont even make a pretense of deserving

Give me credit for being an honest rogue at least

But a rogue she insisted lightly

Oh a question of definitions I could make a very good case for
myself as an honest man

If you thought it worth while

If I didnt happen to want to be square with youhe smiled

Youre so fond of me I suppose that you couldnt bear to have me
think too well of you

You know how fond of you I am

Yes it is a pity about you she scoffed

Believe me yes he replied cheerfully

She drummed with her pink fingertips on her chin studying him
meditatively To do him justice she had to admit that he did not even
pretend much He wanted her because she was a step up in the social
ladder and in his opinion the most attractive girl he knew That he
was not in love with her relieved the situation as Miss Balfour
admitted to herself in impersonal moods But there were times when she
could have wished he were She felt it to be really due her attractions
that his pulses should quicken for her and in the interests of
experience she would have liked to see how he would make love if he
really meant it from the heart and not the will

Its really an awful bother she sighed

Referring to the little problem of your future

Yes

Cant make up your mind whether I come in

No She looked up brightly with an effect of impulsiveness I dont
suppose you want to give me another week

A reprieve But why Youre going to marry me

I suppose so She laughed I wish I could have my cake and eat it
too

It would be a moral iniquity to encourage such a system of ethics

So you wont give me a week she sighed All sorts of things might
have happened in that week I shall always believe that the fairy
prince would have come for me

Believe that he HAS come he claimed

Oh I didnt mean a prince of pirates though there is a triumph in
having tamed a pirate chief to prosaic matrimony In one way it will be
a pity too You wont be half so picturesque You remember how
Stevenson puts it that marriage takes from a man the capacity for
great things whether good or bad

I can stand a good deal of taming

Domesticating a pirate ought to be an interesting process she
conceded her rare smile flashing It should prove a cure for ENNUI
but then Im never a victim of that malady

Am I being told that I am to be the happiest pirate alive

I expect you are

His big hand gripped hers till it tingled She caught his eye on a
roving quest to the door

We dont have to do that she announced hurriedly with an
embarrassed flush

I dont do it because I have to he retorted kissing her on the lips

She fell back protesting Under the circumstances

The butler with a card on a tray interrupted silently She glanced at
the card devoutly grateful his impassive majestys entrance had not
been a moment earlier

Show him in here

The fairy prince five minutes too late asked Ridgway when the man
had gone

For answer she handed him the card yet he thought the pink that
flushed her cheek was something more pronounced than usual But he was
willing to admit there might be a choice of reasons for that

Lyndon Hobart was the name he read

I think the Consolidated is going to have its innings I should like
to stay of course but I fear I must plead a subsequent engagement and
leave the field to the enemy

Pronouncing Mr Hobart without emphasis the butler vanished The
newcomer came forward with the quiet assurance of the born aristocrat
He was a slender wellknit man dressed fastidiously with clearcut
classical features cool keen eyes and a gentle youbedamned manner
to his inferiors Beside him Ridgway bulked too large too florid His
ease seemed a little obvious his prosperity overemphasized Even his
voice strong and reliant lacked the tone of gentle blood that Hobart
had inherited with his nice taste

When Miss Balfour said I think you know each other the manager of
the Consolidated bowed with stiff formality but his rival laughed
genially and said Oh yes I know Mr Hobart The geniality was
genuine enough but through it ran a note of contempt Hobart read in
it a veiled taunt To him it seemed to say

Yes I have met him and beaten him at every turn of the road though
he has been backed by a power with resources a hundred times as great
as mine

In his parting excuses to Miss Balfour Ridgways audacity crystallized
in words that Hobart could only regard as a shameless challenge I
regret that an appointment with Judge Purcell necessitates my leaving
such good company he said urbanely

Purcell was the judge before whom was pending a suit between the
Consolidated and the Mesa Oreproducing Company to determine the
ownership of the Never Say Die Mine and it was current report that
Ridgway owned him as absolutely as he did the automobile waiting for
him now at the door

If Ridgway expected his opponent to pay his flippant gibe the honor of
repartee he was disappointed To be sure Hobart admirably erect in
his slender grace was moved to a slight disdainful smile but it
evidenced scarcely the appreciation that anybody less impervious to
criticism than Ridgway would have cared to see



CHAPTER 2 THE FREEBOOTER

When next Virginia Balfour saw Waring Ridgway she was driving her trap
down one of the hitormiss streets of Mesa where derricks
shafthouses and gray slagdumps shoulder ornate mansions conglomerate
of many unharmonious details of architecture To Miss Balfour these
composites and their owners would have been joys unalloyed except for
the microbe of society ambition that was infecting the latter and
transforming them from simple robust selfreliant Westerners into a
class of servile nondescript newly rich that resembled their
unfettered selves as much as tame bears do the grizzlies of their own
Rockies As she had once complained smilingly to Hobart she had not
come to the West to study ragged edges of the social fringe She might
have done that in New York

Virginia was still a block or two from the courthouse on the hill
when it emptied into the street a concourse of excited men That this
was an occasion of some sort it was easy to guess and of what sort she
began to have an inkling when Ridgway came out the center of a circle
of congratulating admirers She was obliged to admit that he accepted
their applause without in the least losing his head Indeed he took it
as imperturbably as did Hobart against whom a wave of the enthusiasm
seemed to be directed in the form of a jeer when he passed down the
steps with Mott one of the Consolidated lawyers Miss Balfour timed
her approach to meet Hobart at a right angle

What is it all about she asked after he had reached her side

Judge Purcell has just decided the Never Say Die case in favor of Mr
Ridgway and against the Consolidated

Is that a great victory for him

Yes its a victory though of course we appeal admitted Hobart
But we cant say we didnt expect it he added cheerfully

Maynt I give you a lift if you are going downtown she said
quickly for Ridgway having detached himself from the group was
working toward her and she felt an instinctive sympathy for the man
who had lost Furthermore she had something she wanted to tell him
before he heard it on the tongue of rumor

Since you are so kind and he climbed to the place beside her

Congratulate me Miss Balfour demanded Ridgway as he shook hands
with her nodding coolly at her companion Im a million dollars
richer than I was an hour ago I have met the enemy and he is mine

Virginia resenting the bad taste of his jeer at the man who sat beside
her misunderstood him promptly Did you say you had met the enemy and
won his mine

He laughed Youre a good one

Thank you very much for this unsolicited testimonial she said
gravely In the meantime to avoid a congestion of traffic well be
moving if you will kindly give me back my front left wheel

He did not lift his foot from the spoke on which it rested My
congratulations he reminded her

I wish you all the joy in your victory that you deserve and I hope
the supreme court will reaffirm the decision of Judge Purcell if it is
a just one was the form in which she acceded to his demand

She flicked her whip and Ridgway fell back laughing Youve been
subsidized by the Consolidated he shouted after her

Hobart watched silently the businesslike directness with which the girl
handled the ribbons She looked every inch the thoroughbred in her
wellmade covert coat and dainty driving gauntlets The grace of the
alert slender figure the perfect poise of the beautiful little tawny
head proclaimed her distinction no less certainly than the fine
modeling of the mobile face It was a distinction that stirred the
pulse of his emotion and disarmed his keen critical sense Ridgway
could study her with an amused detached interest but Hobarts
admiration had traveled past that point He found it as impossible to
define her charm as to evade it Her inheritance of blood and her
environment should have made her a finished product of civilization
but her salty breeziness her nerve vivid as a flame at times
disturbed delightfully the poise that held her when in repose

When Virginia spoke it was to ask abruptly Is it really his mine

Judge Purcell says so

But do YOU think sodown in the bottom of your heart

Wouldnt I naturally be prejudiced

I suppose you would Everybody in Mesa seems to have taken sides
either with Mr Ridgway or the Consolidated Still you have an option
Is he what his friends proclaim himthe generoushearted independent
fighting against trust domination Or is he merely an audacious
orethief as his enemies say The truth must be somewhere

It seems to lie mostly in point of view here the angle of observation
being determined by interest he answered

And from your angle of observation

He is the most unusual man I ever saw the most resourceful and the
most competent He never knows when he is beaten I suppose thats the
reason he never is beaten finally We have driven him to the wall a
score of times My experience with him is that hes most dangerous when
one thinks he must be about hammered out He always hits back then in
the most daring and unexpected way

With a couplingpin she suggested with a little reminiscent laugh

Metaphorically speaking He reaches for the first effective weapon to
his hand

You havent quite answered my question yet she reminded him Is he
what his friends or what his enemies think him

If you ask me I can only say that Im one of his enemies

But a fairminded man she replied quickly

Thank you Then Ill say that perhaps he is neither just what his
friends or his foes think him One must make allowances for his
training and temperament and for that quality of bigness in him
Mediocre men go soberly on the highroads but saints and scoundrels
meet in the jails he smilingly quoted

He would make a queer sort of saint she laughed

A typical twentieth century one of a moneymad age

She liked it in him that he would not use the opportunity she had made
to sneer at his adversary none the less because she knew that Ridgway
might not have been so scrupulous in his place That Lyndon Hobarts
fastidious instincts for fair play had stood in the way of his success
in the fight to down Ridgway she had repeatedly heard Of late rumors
had persisted in reporting dissatisfaction with his management of the
Consolidated at the great financial center on Broadway which controlled
the big copper company Simon Harley the dominating factor in the
octopus whose tentacles reached out in every direction to monopolize
the avenues of wealth demanded of his subordinates results Methods
were no concern of his and failure could not be explained to him He
wanted Ridgway crushed and the pulse of the copper production
regulated lay the Consolidated Instead he had seen Ridgway rise
steadily to power and wealth despite his efforts to wipe him off the
slate Hobart was perfectly aware that his head was likely to fall when
Harley heard of Purcells decision in regard to the Never Say Die

He certainly is an amazing man Virginia mused her fiancee in mind
It would be interesting to discover what he cant doalong
utilitarian lines I mean Is he as good a miner underground as he is
in the courts she flung out

He is the shrewdest investor I know Time and again he has leased or
bought apparently worthless claims and made them pay inside of a few
weeks Take the Taurus as a case in point He struck rich ore in a
fortnight Other men had done development work for years and found
nothing

Im naturally interested in knowing all about him because I have just
become engaged to him explained Miss Virginia as calmly as if her
pulse were not fluttering a hundred to the minute

Virginia was essentially a sportsman She did not flinch from the guns
when the firing was heavy It had been remarked of her even as a child
that she liked to get unpleasant things over with as soon as possible
rather than postpone them Once _aetat_ eight she had marched in to
her mother like a stoic and announced Ive come to be whipped
momsie cause I broke that horrid little Nellie Vailes doll I did it
on purpose cause I was mad at her Im glad I broke it so there

Hobart paled slightly beneath his outdoors Western tan but his eyes
met hers very steadily and fairly I wish you happiness Miss Balfour
from the bottom of my heart

She nodded a brisk Thank you and directed her attention again to the
horses

Take him by and large Mr Ridgway is the most capable energetic and
farsighted business man I have ever known He has a bigger grasp of
things than almost any financier in the country I think youll find he
will go far he said choosing his words with care to say as much for
Waring Ridgway as he honestly could

I have always thought so agreed Virginia

She had reason for thinking so in that young mans remarkable career
When Waring Ridgway had first come to Mesa he had been a draftsman for
the Consolidated at five dollars a day He was just out of Cornell and
his assets consisted mainly of a supreme confidence in himself and an
imposing presence He was a born leader and he flung himself into the
raw turbid life of the mining town with a readiness that had not a
little to do with his subsequent success

That success began to take tangible form almost from the first A
small independent smelter that had for long been working at a loss was
about to fall into the hands of the Consolidated when Ridgway bought it
on promises to pay made good by raising money on a flying trip he took
to the East His father died about this time and left him fifty
thousand dollars with which he bought the Taurus a mine in which
several adventurous spirits had dropped small fortunes He acquired
other properties a lease here an interest there It began to be
observed that he bought always with judgment He seemed to have the
touch of Midas Where other men had lost money he made it

When the officers of the Consolidated woke up to the menace of his
presence one of their lawyers called on him The agent of the
Consolidated smiled at his luxurious offices which looked more like a
womans boudoir than the business place of a Western miner But that
was merely part of Ridgways vanity and did not in the least interfere
with his predatory instincts Many people who walked into that parlor
to do business played fly to his spider

The lawyer had been ready to patronize the upstart who had ventured so
boldly into the territory of the great trust but one glance at the
clearcut resolute face of the young man changed his mind

Ive come to make you an offer for your smelter Mr Ridgway he
began Well take it off your hands at the price it cost you

Not for sale Mr Bartel

Very well Well give you ten thousand more than you paid for it

You misunderstand me It is not for sale

Oh come You bought it to sell to us What can you do with it

Run it suggested Ridgway

Without ore

You forget that I own a few properties and have leases on others
When the Taurus begins producing Ill have enough to keep the smelter
going

When the Taurus begins producingBartel smiled skeptically Didnt
Johnson and Leroy drop fortunes on that expectation

Ill bet five thousand dollars we make a strike within two weeks

Chimerical pronounced the graybeard as he rose to go with an air of
finality Better sell the smelter while you have the chance

Think not disagreed Ridgway

At the door the lawyer turned Oh theres another matter It had
slipped my mind He spoke with rather elaborate carelessness It
seems that there is a little triangleabout ten and four feet
acrosswedged in between the Mary K the Diamond King and the Marcus
Daly For some reason we accidentally omitted to file on it Our chief
engineer finds that you have taken it up Mr Ridgway It is really of
no value but it is in the heart of our properties and so it ought to
belong to us Of course it is of no use to you There isnt any
possible room to sink a shaft Well take it from you if you like and
even pay you a nominal price For what will you sell

Ridgway lit a cigar before he answered One million dollars

What screamed Bartel

Not a cent less I call it the Trust Buster Before Im through
youll find it is worth that to me

The lawyer reported him demented to the Consolidated officials who
declared war on him from that day

They found the young adventurer more than prepared for them If he had
a Napoleonic sense of big vital factors he had no less a genius for
detail He had already picked up an intimate knowledge of the hundreds
of veins and crossveins that traverse the Mesa copperfields and he
had delved patiently into the tangled history of the litigation that
the defective mining laws in pioneer days had made possible When the
Consolidated attempted to harass him by legal process he countered by
instituting a score of suits against the company within the week These
had to do with wills insanity cases extra lateral rights mine
titles and land and water rights Wherever Ridgway saw room for an
entering wedge to dispute the title of the Consolidated he drove a new
suit home To say the least the trust found it annoying to be enjoined
from working its mines to be cited for contempt before judges employed
in the interests of its opponent to be served with restraining orders
when clearly within its rights But when these adverse legal decisions
began to affect vital issues the Consolidated looked for reasons why
Ridgway should control the courts It found them in politics

For Ridgway was already dominating the politics of Yuba County
displaying an amazing acumen and a surprising ability as a
stumpspeaker He posed as a friend of the people an enemy of the
trust He declared an eighthour day for his own miners and called
upon the Consolidated to do the same Hobart refused acting on orders
from Broadway and fifteen thousand Consolidated miners went to the
polls and reelected Ridgways corrupt judges in spite of the fight the
Consolidated was making against them

Meanwhile Ridgways colossal audacity made the Consolidateds copper
pay for the litigation with which he was harassing it In following his
oreveins or what he claimed to be his veins he crossed boldly into
the territory of the enemy By the law of extra lateral rights a man
is entitled to mine within the lines of other property than his own
provided he is following the dip of a vein which has its apex in his
claim Ridgways experts were prepared to swear that all the best veins
in the field apexed in his property Pending decisions of the courts
they assumed it tunneling through granite till they tapped the veins
of the Consolidated mines meanwhile enjoining that company from
working the very ore of which Ridgway was robbing it

Many times the great trust back of the Consolidated had him close to
ruin but Ridgways alert brain and supreme audacity carried him
through From their mines or from his own he always succeeded in
extracting enough ore to meet his obligations when they fell due His
powerful enemy as Hobart had told Miss Balfour found him most
dangerous when it seemed to have him with his back to the wall Then
unexpectedly would fall some crushing blow that put the financial kings
of Broadway on the defensive long enough for him to slip out of the
corner into which they had driven him Greatly daring he had the
successful cavalrymans instinct of risking much to gain much A
gambler his enemies characterized him fitly enough But it was also
true as Mesa phrased it that he gambled with the lid off playing
for large stakes neither asking nor giving quarter

At the end of five years of desperate fighting the freebooter was more
strongly entrenched than he had been at any previous time The
railroads pledged to give rebates to the Consolidated had been forced
by Ridgway under menace of adverse legislation from the men he
controlled at the Statehouse to give him secretly a still better rate
than the trust He owned the county courts he was supported by the
people and had become a political dictator and the financial outlook
for him grew brighter every day

Such were the conditions when Judge Purcell handed down his Never Say
Die decision Within an hour Hobart was reading a telegram in cipher
from the Broadway headquarters It announced the immediate departure
for Mesa of the great leader of the octopus Simon Harley the Napoleon
of finance was coming out to attend personally to the destruction of
the buccaneer who had dared to fire on the trust flag

Before night some one of his corps of spies in the employ of the enemy
carried the news to Waring Ridgway He smiled grimly his bluegray eyes
hardening to the temper of steel Here at last was a foeman worthy of
his metal one as lawless unscrupulous daring and farseeing as
himself with a hundred times his resources



CHAPTER 3 ONE TO ONE

The solitary rider stood for a moment in silhouette against the somber
skyline his keen eyes searching the lowering clouds

Getting its back up for a blizzard he muttered to himself as he
touched his pony with the spur

Dark heavy billows banked in the west piling over each other as they
drove forward Already the advanceguard had swept the sunlight from
the earth except for a flutter of it that still protested near the
horizon Scattering snowflakes were flying and even in a few minutes
the temperature had fallen many degrees

The rider knew the signs of old He recognized the sudden stealthy
approach that transformed a sundrenched friendly plain into an
unknown arctic waste Not for nothing had he been last year one of a
searchparty to find the bodies of three miners frozen to death not
fifty yards from their own cabin He understood perfectly what it meant
to be caught away from shelter when the driven white pall wiped out
distance and direction made long familiar landmarks strange and
numbed the will to a helpless surrender The knowledge of it was spur
enough to make him ride fast while he still retained the sense of
direction

But silently steadily the storm increased and he was forced to
slacken his pace As the blinding snow grew thick the sound of the
wind deadened unable to penetrate the dense white wall through which
he forced his way The world narrowed to a space whose boundaries he
could touch with his extended hands In this white mystery that wrapped
him nothing was left but stinging snow bitter cold and the silence
of the dead

So he thought one moment and the next was almost flung by his swerving
horse into a vehicle that blocked the road Its blurred outlines
presently resolved themselves into an automobile crouched in the
bottom of which was an inert huddle of humanity

He shouted forgetting that no voice could carry through the muffled
scream of the storm When he got no answer he guided his horse close
to the machine and reached down to snatch away the rug already heavy
with snow To his surprise it was a girls despairing face that looked
up at him She tried to rise but fell back her muscles too numb to
serve

Dont leave me she implored stretching her arms toward him

He reached out and lifted her to his horse Are you alone

Yes He went for help when the machine broke downbefore the storm
she sobbed He had to put his ear to her mouth to catch the words

Come keep up your heart There was that in his voice pealed like a
trumpetcall to her courage

Im freezing to death she moaned

She was exhausted and benumbed her lips blue her flesh gray It was
plain to him that she had reached the limit of endurance that she was
ready to sink into the last torpor He ripped open his overcoat and
shook the snow from it then gathered her close so that she might get
the warmth of his body The rugs from the automobile he wrapped round
them both

Courage he cried Theres a miners cabin near Dont give up
child

But his own courage was of the heart and will not of the head He had
small hope of reaching the hut at the entrance of Dead Mans Gulch or
if he could struggle so far of finding it in the white swirl that
clutched at them Near and far are words not coined for a blizzard He
might stagger past with safety only a dozen feet from him He might lie
down and die at the very threshold of the door Or he might wander in
an opposite direction and miss the cabin by a mile

Yet it was not in the man to give up He must stagger on till he could
no longer stand He must fight so long as life was in him He must
crawl forward though his forlorn hope had vanished And he did When
the wornout horse slipped down and could not be coaxed to its feet
again he picked up the bundle of rugs and plowed forward blindly soul
and body racked but teeth still set fast with the primal instinct
never to give up The intense cold of the air thick with gray sifted
ice searched the warmth from his body and sapped his vitality His
numbed legs doubled under him like springs He was down and up again a
dozen times but always the call of life drove him on dragging his
helpless burden with him

That he did find the safety of the cabin in the end was due to no
wisdom on his part He had followed unconsciously the dip of the ground
that led him into the little draw where it had been built and by sheer
luck stumbled against it His strength was gone but the door gave to
his weight and he buckled across the threshold like a man helpless
with drink He dropped to the floor ready to sink into a stupor but
he shook sleep from him and dragged himself to his feet Presently his
numb fingers found a match a newspaper and some wood As soon as he
had control over his hands he fell to chafing hers He slipped off her
dainty shoes pathetically inadequate for such an experience and
rubbed her feet back to feeling She had been torpid but when the
blood began to circulate she cried out in agony at the pain

Every inch of her bore the hallmark of wealth The erminelined
motoringcloak the broadcloth cut on simple lines of elegance the
quality of her lingerie and of the hosiery which incased the
wonderfully small feet all told of a padded existence from which the
cares of life had been excluded The satin flesh he massaged to renew
the flow of the dammed blood was soft and tender like a babes Quite
surely she was an exotic the last woman in the world fitted for the
hardships of this frontier country She had none of the deepbreasted
vitality of those of her sex who have fought with grim nature and won
His experience told him that a very little longer in the storm would
have snuffed out the wick of her life

But he knew too that the danger was past Faint tints of pink were
beginning to warm the cheeks that had been so deathly pallid Already
crimson lips were offering a vivid contrast to the still almost
colorless face

For she was biting the little lips to try and keep back the cries of
pain that returning life wrung from her Big tears coursed down her
cheeks and broken sobs caught her breath She was helpless as an
infant before the searching pain that wracked her

I cant stand itI cant stand it she moaned and in her distress
stretched out her little hand for relief as a baby might to its mother

The childlike appeal of the flinching violet eyes in the tortured face
moved him strangely He was accounted a hard man not without reason
His eyes were those of a gambler cold and vigilant It was said that
he could follow an undeviating course without relenting at the ruin and
misery wrought upon others by his operations But the helpless
loveliness of this exquisitely dainty childwoman the sense of
intimacy bred of a common peril endured of the strangeness of their
environment and of her utter dependence upon him carried the man out
of himself and away from conventions

He stooped and gathered her into his arms walking the floor with her
and cheering her as if she had indeed been the child they both for the
moment conceived her

You dont know how it hurts she pleaded between sobs looking up
into the strong face so close to hers

I know it must dear But soon it will be better Every twinge is one
less and shows that you are getting well Be brave for just a few
minutes more now

She smiled wanly through her tears But Im not brave Im a little
cowardand it does pain so

I knowI know It is dreadful But just a few minutes now

Youre good to me she said presently simply as a little girl might
have said it

To neither of them did it seem strange that she should be there in his
arms her fair head against his shoulder nor that she should cling
convulsively to him when the fierce pain tingled unbearably She had
reached out for the nearest help and he gave of his strength and
courage abundantly

Presently the prickling of the flowing blood grew less sharp She began
to grow drowsy with warmth after the fatigue and pain The big eyes
shut fluttered open smiled at him and again closed She had fallen
asleep from sheer exhaustion

He looked down with an odd queer feeling at the small aristocratic face
relaxed upon his ann The long lashes had drooped to the cheeks and
shuttered the eyes that had met his with such confident appeal but
they did not hide the dark rings underneath born of the hardships she
had endured As he walked the floor with her he lived once more the
terrible struggle through which they had passed He saw Death
stretching out icy hands for her and as his arms unconsciously
tightened about the soft rounded body his square jaw set and the
fighting spark leaped to his eyes

No by Heaven he gave back aloud his defiance

Troubled dreams pursued her in her sleep She clung close to him her
arm creeping round his neck for safety He was a man not given to fine
scruples but all the best in him responded to her unconscious trust

It was so she found herself when she awakened stiff from her cramped
position She slipped at once to the floor and sat there drying her
lace skirts the sweet piquancy of her childish face set out by the
leaping fireglow that lit and shadowed her delicate coloring Outside
in the gray darkness raged the death from which he had snatched her by
a miracle Beyonda million miles awaythe world whose claim had
loosened on them was going through its routine of lies and love of
hypocrisies and heroisms But here were just they two flung back to
the primordial type by the fierce battle for existence that had
encompassed themAdam and Eve in the garden one to one all else
forgot all other ties and obligations for the moment obliterated Had
they not struggled heart beating against heart with the breath of
death icing them and come out alive Was their world not contracted to
a space ten feet by twelve shut in from every other planet by an
illimitable stretch of storm

Where should I have been if you had not found me she murmured her
haunting eyes fixed on the flames

But I should have found youno matter where you had been I should
have found you

The words seemed to leap from him of themselves He was sure he had not
meant to speak them to voice so soon the claim that seemed to him so
natural and reasonable

She considered his words and found delight in acquiescing at once The
unconscious demand for life for love of her starved soul had never
been gratified But he had come to her through that fearful valley of
death because he must because it had always been meant he should

Her lustrous eyes big with faith looked up and met his

The far wise voices of the world were stormdeadened They cried no
warning to these drifting hearts How should they know in that moment
when their souls reached toward each other that the wisdom of the ages
had decreed their yearning futile



CHAPTER 4 FORT SALVATION

She must have fallen asleep there for when she opened her eyes it was
day Underneath her was a lot of bedding he had found in the cabin and
tucked about her were the automobile rugs For a moment her brain
still sodden with sleep struggled helplessly with her surroundings
She looked at the smoky rafters without understanding and her eyes
searched the cabin wonderingly for her maid When she remembered her
first thought was to look for the man That he had gone she saw with
instinctive terror

But not without leaving a message She found his penciled note
weighted for security by a dollar at the edge of the hearth

Gone on a foraging expedition Back in an hour Little Partner was
all it said The other man also had promised to be back in an hour and
he had not come but the strong chirography of the note recalling the
resolute strength of this mans face brought content to her eyes He
had said he would come back She rested secure in that pledge

She went to the window and looked out over the great white wastes that
rose tier on tier to the dull skyline She shuddered at the arctic
desolation of the vast snowfields The mountains were sheeted with
silence and purity It seemed to the untaught childwoman that she was
face to face with the Almighty

Once during the night she had partially awakened to hear the roaring
wind as it buffeted snowclouds across the range It had come tearing
along the divide with the black storm in its vanguard and she had
heard fearfully the shrieks and screams of the battle as it raged up
and down the gulches and sifted into them the deep drifts

Halfasleep as she was she had been afraid and had cried out with
terror at this strange wakening and he had been beside her in an
instant

Its all right partner Theres nothing to be afraid of he had said
cheerfully taking her little hand in his big warm one

Her fears had slipped away at once Nestling down into her rug she had
smiled sleepily at him and fallen asleep with her cheek on her hand
her other hand still in his

While she had been asleep the snowtides had filled the gulch had
risen level with the top of the lower pane of the window Nothing broke
the smoothness of its flow save the one track he had made in breaking a
way out That he should have tried to find his way through such an
untracked desolation amazed her He could never do it No puny human
atom could fight successfully against the barriers nature had dropped
so sullenly to fence them They were set off from the world by a
quarantine of God There was something awful to her in the knowledge
It emphasized their impotence Yet this man had set himself to fight
the inevitable

With a little shudder she turned from the window to the cheerless room
The floor was dirty unwashed dishes were piled upon the table Here
and there were scattered muddy boots and overalls just as their owner
the prospector had left them before he had gone to the nearest town to
restock his exhausted supply of provisions Disorder and dirt filled
the rough cabin or so it seemed to her fastidious eye

The inspiration of the housewife seized her She would surprise him on
his return by opening the door to him upon a house swept and garnished
She would show him that she could be of some use even in such a
primitive topsyturvy world as this into which Fate had thrust her
willynilly

First she carried red live coals on a shovel from the fireplace to the
cookstove and piled kindling upon them till it lighted It was a new
experience to her She knew nothing of housework had never lit a fire
in her life except once when she had been one of a camping party The
smoke choked her before she had the lids back in their places but
despite her awkwardness the girl went about her unaccustomed tasks
with a light heart It was for her newfound hero that she played at
housekeeping For his commendation she filled the teakettle enveloped
herself in a cloud of dust as she wielded the stub of a broom she
discovered and washed the greasy dishes after the water was hot A
childish pleasure suffused her All her life her least whims had been
ministered to she was reveling in a first attempt at service As she
moved to and fro with an improvised dustrag sunshine filled her
being From her lips the joy notes fell in song shaken from her throat
for sheer happiness This surely was life that life from which she had
so carefully been hedged all the years of her young existence

As he came down the trail he had broken with a pack on his back the
man heard her birdlike carol in the clear frosty air He emptied his
chest in a deep shout and she was instantly at the window waving him
a welcome with her dustrag

I thought you were never coming she cried from the open door as he
came up the path

Her eyes were starry in their eagerness Every sensitive feature was
alert with interest so that the man thought he had never seen so
mobile and attractive a face

Did it seem long he asked

Oh weeks and weeks You must be frozen to an icicle Come in and get
warm

Im as warm as toast he assured her

He was glowing with exercise and the sting of the cold for he had
tramped two miles through drifts from three to five feet deep battling
with them every step of the way and carrying with him on the return
trip a box of provisions

With all that snow on you and the pack on your back its like Santa
Claus she cried clapping her hands

Before were through with the adventure we may think that box a sure
enough gift from Santa he replied

After he had put it down he took off his overcoat on the threshold and
shook the snow from it Then with much feet stamping and scattering of
snow he came in She fluttered about him dragging a chair up to the
fire for him and taking his hat and gloves It amused and pleased him
that she should be so solicitous and he surrendered himself to her
ministrations

His quick eye noticed the swept floor and the evanishment of disorder
Hello Whats this clean through a fall housecleaning Im not the
only member of the firm that has been working Dishes washed floor
swept bed made kitchen fire lit Youve certainly been going some
unless the fairies helped you Arent you afraid of blistering these
little hands he asked gaily taking one of them in his and touching
the soft palm gently with the tip of his finger

I should preserve those blisters in alcohol to show that Ive really
been of some use she answered happy in his approval

Sho People are made for different uses Some are fit only to shovel
and dig Others are here simply to decorate the world Hard world Hard
work is for those who cant give society anything else but beauty is
its own excuse for being he told her breezily

Now thats the first compliment you have given me she pouted
prettily I can get them in plenty back in the drawingrooms where I
am supposed to belong Were to be real comrades here and compliments
are barred

I wasnt complimenting you he maintained I was merely stating a
principle of art

Then you mustnt make your principles of art personal sir But since
you have Im going to refute the application of your principle and
show how useful Ive been Now sir do you know what provisions we
have outside of those you have just brought

He knew exactly since he had investigated during the night That they
might possibly have to endure a siege of some weeks he was quite well
aware and his first thought after she had gone to sleep before the
fire had been to make inventory of such provisions as the prospector
had left in his cabin A knuckle of ham part of a sack of flour some
navy beans and some tea siftings at the bottom of a tin can these
constituted the contents of the larder which the miner had gone to
replenish But though the man knew he assumed ignorance for he saw
that she was bubbling over with the desire to show her forethought

Tell me he begged of her and after she had done so he marveled
aloud over her wisdom in thinking of it

Now tell me about your trip she commanded setting herself tailor
fashion on the rug to listen

There isnt much to tell he smiled I should like to make an
adventure of it but I cant I just went and came back

Oh you just went and came back did you she scoffed That wont do
at all I want to know all about it Did you find the machine all
right

I found it where we left it buried in four feet of snow You neednt
be afraid that anybody will run away with it for a day or two The
pantry was cached pretty deep itself but I dug it out

Her shy glance admired the sturdy lines of his powerful frame I am
afraid it must have been a terrible task to get there through the
blizzard

Oh the blizzard is past You never saw a finer more bracing morning
Its a day for the gods he laughed boyishly

She could have conceived no Olympian more heroic than he and certainly
none with so compelling a vitality Such a warm kind light in them
she thought of the eyes others had found hard and calculating

It was lucky that the lunch the automobilists had brought from
Avalanche was ample and as yet untouched The hotel waiter who had
attended to the packing of it had fortunately been used to reckon with
outdoor Montana appetites instead of cloyed New York ones They
unpacked the little hamper with much gaiety Everything was frozen
solid and the wine had cracked its bottle

Shipped right through on our private refrigeratorcar That
coldstorage chicken looks the finest that ever happened Whats this
rolled up in tissuepaper Deviled eggs and ham sandwiches AND caviar
not to speak of claret frappe Im certainly grateful to the gentleman
finished in ebony who helped to provision us for this siege Hell
never know what a tip he missed by not being here to collect

Heres jelly too and cake she said exploring with him

Not to mention peaches and pears Oh this is luck of a special brand
I was expecting to put up at Starvation Camp Now we may name it Point
Plenty

Or Fort Salvation she suggested shyly Because you brought me here
to save my life

She was such a child in spite of her charming grownup airs that he
played makebelieve with a zest that surprised himself when he came to
think of it She elected him captain of Fort Salvation with full power
of life and death over the garrison and he appointed her second in
command His first general order was to put the garrison on two meals a
day

She clapped her little hands eyes sparkling with excitement Are we
really snowbound Must we go on halfrations

It is the part of wisdom lieutenant he answered smiling at her
enthusiasm We dont know how long this siege is going to last If it
should set in to snow we may be here several days before the
reliefparty reaches us But though he spoke cheerfully he was aware
of sinister possibilities in the situation Several weeks would have
been nearer his real guess

They ate breakfast at the shelftable nailed in place underneath the
western window They made a picnic of it and her spirits skipped upon
the hilltops For the first time she ate from tin plates drank from a
tin cup and used a tin spoon the worse for rust What mattered it to
her that the teapot was grimy and the fryingpan black with soot It was
all part of the wonderful new vista that had suddenly opened before her
gaze She had awakened into life and already she was dimly realizing
that many and varied experiences lay waiting for her in that untrodden
path beyond her cloistered world

A reconnaissance in the shed behind the house showed him no plethora of
firewood But here was ax shovel and saw and he asked no more First
he shoveled out a path along the eaves of the house where she might
walk in sentry fashion to take the deep breaths of clear sharp air he
insisted upon He made it wide enough so that her skirt would not sweep
against the snowbank and trod down the trench till the footing was
hard and solid Then with ax and saw he climbed the hillside back of
the house and set himself to get as much fuel as he could The sky was
still heavy with unshed snow and he knew that with the coming of night
the storm would be renewed

Came noon midafternoon the early dusk of a mountain winter and
found him still hewing and sawing still piling load after load in the
shed Now and again she came out and watched him laughing at the
figure he made as he would come plunging through the snow with his
armful of fuel

She did not know as he did the vital necessity of filling the leanto
before winter fell upon them in earnest and buried them deep with his
frozen blanket and she was a little piqued that he should spend the
whole day away from her in such unsocial fashion

Let me help she begged so often that he trod down a path made boots
for her out of torn gunnysacks which he tied round her legs and let
her drag wood to the house on a pine branch which served for a sled
She wore her gauntlets to protect her tender hands and thereafter was
happy until detecting signs of fatigue he made her go into the house
and rest

As soon as she dared she was back again making fun of him and the
earnestness with which he worked

Robinson Crusoe was one name she fastened upon him and she was not
satisfied till she had made him call her Friday

Twilight fell austere and sudden upon them with an immediate fall of
temperature that found a thermometer in her blue face

He recommended the house but she was of a contrary mood

I dont want to she announced debonairly

In a stiff military attitude he gave raucous mandate from his throat

Commanding officers orders lieutenant

I think Im going to mutiny she informed him with chin saucily in
air

This would not do at all The chill wind sweeping down the canon was
searching her insufficient clothing already He picked her up in his
arms and ran with her toward the house setting her down in the trench
outside the door She caught her startled breath and looked at him in
shy dubious amazement

Really you she was beginning when he cut her short

Commanding officers orders lieutenant came briskly from lips that
showed just a hint of a smile

At once she clicked her heels together saluted and wheeled into the
cabin

From the grimy window she watched his broadshouldered vigor waving
her hand whenever his face was turned her way He worked like a Titan
reveling in the joy of physical labor but it was long past dark before
he finished and came striding to the hut

They made a delightful evening of it living in the land of Never Was
For one source of her charm lay in the gay childlike whimsicality of
her imagination She believed in fairies and heroes with all her heart
which with her was an organ not located in her brain The delicious
gurgle of gaiety in her laugh was a new find to him in feminine
attractions

There had been many who thought the career of this pirate of industry
beggared fiction though few had found his flinty personality a
radiaton of romance But this conventnurtured child had made a
discovery in men one out of the rut of the tailormade
conventionbound society youths to whom her experience for the most
part had been limited She delighted in his masterful strength in the
confidence of his careless dominance She liked to see that look of
power in his grayblue eyes softened to the droll halftender
expression with which he played the game of makebelieve There were no
tomorrows today marked the limit of time for them By tacit consent
they lived only in the present shutting out deliberately from their
knowledge of each other that past which was not common to both Even
their names were unknown to each other and both of them were glad that
it was so

The long winter evening had fallen early and they dined by
candlelight considering merrily how much they might with safety eat
and yet leave enough for the tomorrows that lay before them Afterward
they sat before the fire in the shadow and shine of the flickering
logs happy and content in each others presence She dreamed and he
watching her dreamed too The wild sweet wonder of life surged
through them touching their squalid surroundings to the high mystery
of things unreal

The strangeness of it was that he was a man of large and not very
creditable experience of women yet her deep limpid eyes her sweet
voice the immature piquancy of her movements that was the expression
of her had stirred his imagination more potently than if he had been
the veriest schoolboy nursing a downy lip He could not keep his eyes
from this slender exquisite girl so dainty and graceful in her mobile
piquancy Fire and passion were in his heart and soul restraint and
repression in his speech and manner For the fire and passion in him
were pure and clean as the winds that sweep the hills

But for the girlshe was so little mistress of her heart that she had
no prescience of the meaning of this sweet content that filled her And
the voices that should have warned her were silent busy behind the
purple hills with lies and love and laughter and tears



CHAPTER 5 ENTER SIMON HARLEY

The prospectors house in which they had found refuge was perched on
the mountainside just at one edge of the draw Rough as the girl had
thought it there was a more pretentious appearance to it than might
have been expected The cabin was of hewn logs mortared with mud and
care had been taken to make it warm The fireplace was a huge affair
that ate fuel voraciously It was built of stone which had been
gathered from the immediate hillside

The prospect itself showed evidence of having been worked a good deal
and it was an easy guess for the man who now stood looking into the
tunnel that it belonged to some one of the thousands of miners who
spend half their time earning a grubstake and the other half
dissipating it upon some hole in the ground which they have duped
themselves into believing is a mine

From the tunnel his eye traveled up the face of the white mountain to
the great snowcomb that yawned over the edge of the rockrim far
above It had snowed again heavily all night and now showed symptoms
of a thaw Not once nor twice but a dozen times the mans anxious
gaze had swept up to that great overhanging bank Snowslides ran every
year in this section with heavy loss to life and property Given a
rising temperature and some wind the comb above would gradually settle
lower and lower at last break off plunge down the precipitous slope
bringing thousands of tons of rock and snow with it and perhaps bury
them in a Titanic grave of ice There had been a good deal of timber
cut from the shoulder of the mountain during the past summer and this
very greatly increased the danger That there was a real peril the man
looking at it did not attempt to deny to himself It would be enough to
deny it to her in case she should ever suspect

He had hoped for cold weather a freeze hard enough to crust the
surface of the snow Upon this he might have made shift somehow to get
her to Yeslers ranch eighteen miles away though it was but he knew
this would not be feasible with the snow in its present condition It
was not certain that he could make the ranch alone encumbered with
her success would be a sheer impossibility On the other hand their
provisions would not last long The outlook was not a cheerful one
from whichever point of view he took it yet there was one phase of it
he could not regret The factors which made the difficulties of the
situation made also its delights Though they were prisoners in this
solitary untrodden canyon the sentence was upon both of them She
could look to none other than he for aid and at least the drifts
which kept them in held others out

Her voice at his shoulder startled him

Wherefore this long communion with nature my captain she gaily
asked Behold my lords hot cakes are ready for the pan and his
servant to wait upon him She gave him a demure smiling little curtsy
of mock deference

Never had her distracting charm been more in evidence He had not seen
her since they parted on the previous night He had built for himself a
cot in the woodshack and had contrived a curtain that could be drawn
in front of her bed in the livingroom Thus he could enter in the
morning light the fires and start breakfast without disturbing her
She had dressed her hair now in a different way so that it fell in
low waves back from the forehead and was bunched at the nape of her
neck The light swiftness of her dainty grace the almost exaggerated
carnation of the slightly parted lips the glad eagerness that sparked
her eyes brought out effectively the picturesqueness of her beauty

His grave eyes rested on her so long that a soft glow mantled her
cheeks Perhaps her words had been too free though she had not meant
them so For the first time some thought of the conventions distressed
her Ought she to hold herself more in reserve toward him Must she
restrain her natural impulses to friendliness

His eyes released her presently but not before she read in them the
feelings that had softened them as they gazed into hers They mirrored
his poignant pleasure at the delight of her sweet slenderness so close
to him his perilous joy at the intimacy fate had thrust upon them
Shyly her lids fell to the flushed cheeks

Breakfast is ready she added selfconsciously her girlish innocence
startled like a fawn of the forest at the hunters approach

For whereas she had been blind now she saw in part Some flash of
clairvoyance had laid bare a glimpse of his heart and her own to her
Without misunderstanding the perfect respect for her which he felt she
knew the turbid banked emotions which this dammed Her heart seemed to
beat in her bosom like an imprisoned dove

It was his voice calm and resonant with strength that brought her to
earth again

And I am ready for it lieutenant Right about face Forwardmarch


After breakfast they went out and tramped together the little path of
hardtrodden snow in front of the house She broached the prospect of a
rescue or the chances of escape

We shall soon be out of food and anyhow we cant stay here all
winter she suggested with a tremulous little laugh

You are naturally very tired of it already he hazarded

It has been the experience of my life I shall fence it off from all
the days that have passed and all that are to come she made answer
vividly

Their eyes met but only for an instant

I am glad he said quietly

He began then to tell her what he must do but at the first word of
it she broke out in protest

Nonono We shall stay together If you go I am going too

I wish you could but it is not possible You could never get there
The snow is too soft and heavy for wading and not firm enough to bear
your weight

But you will have to wade

I am stronger than you lieutenant

I know but She broke down and confessed her terror Would you
leave me herealonewith all this snow Oh I couldnt stayI
couldnt

Its the only way he said steadily Every fiber in him rebelled at
leaving her here to face peril alone but his reason overrode the
desire and rebellion that were hot within him He must think first of
her ultimate safety and this lay in getting her away from here at the
first chance

Tears splashed down from the big eyes I didnt think you would leave
me here alone With you I dont mind it but Oh I should die if I
stayed alone

Only for twentyfour hours Perhaps less I shouldnt think of it if
it werent necessary

Take me with you I am strong You dont know how strong I am I
promise to keep up with you Please

He shook his head I would take you with me if I could You know that
But its a mans fight I shall have to stand up to it hour after hour
till I reach Yeslers ranch I shall get through but it would not be
possible for you to make it

And if you dont get through

He refused to consider that contingency But I shall You may look to
see me back with help by this time tomorrow morning

Im not afraid with you But if you go away Oh I cant stand it You
dont knowyou dont know She buried her face in her hands

He had to swallow down his sympathy before he went on Yes I know
But you must be brave You must think of every minute as being one
nearer to the time of my return

You will think me a dreadful coward and I am But I cant help it I
AM afraid to stay alone Theres nothing in the world but mountains of
snow They are horriblelike deathexcept when you are here

Her child eyes coaxed him to stay The mad longing was in him to kiss
the rosy little mouth with the queer alluring droop to its corners It
was a strange thing how with that arched twist to her eyebrows and
with that smile which came and went like sunshine in her eyes she
toppled his lifelong creed The cardinal tenet of his faith had been a
belief in strength He had first been drawn to Virginia by reason of
her pluck and her power Yet this childs very weakness was her
fountain of strength She cried out with pain and he counted it an
asset of virtue in her She acknowledged herself a coward and his
heart went out to her because of it The battle assignments of life
were not for the soft curves and shy winsomeness of this dainty lamb

You will be brave I expect you to be brave lieutenant Words of
love and comfort were crowding to his brain but he would not let them
out

How long will you be gone she sobbed

I may possibly get back before midnight but you mustnt begin to
expect me until tomorrow morning perhaps not till tomorrow
afternoon

Oh I couldntI couldnt stay here at night alone Dont go please
Ill not get hungry truly I wont and tomorrow they will find us

He rose his face working I MUST go child Its the thing to do I
wish to Heaven it werent You must think of yourself as quite safe
here You ARE safe Dont make it hard for me to go dear

I AM a coward But I cant help it There is so much snowand the
mountains are so big She tried valiantly to crush down her sobs But
go IllIll not be afraid

He buried her little hands in his two big ones and looked deep into her
eyes Every minute of the time I am away from you I shall be with you
in spirit Youll not be alone any minute of the day or night Whether
you are awake or asleep I shall be with you

Ill try to remember that she answered smiling up at him but with a
trembling lip

She put him up some lunch while he made his simple preparations To the
end of the trench she walked with him neither of them saying a word
The moment of parting had come

She looked up at him with a crooked wavering little smile She wanted
to be brave but she could not trust herself to say a word

Remember dear I am not leaving you My body has gone on an errand
That is all

Just now she found small comfort in this sophistry but she did not
tell him so

IIll remember She gulped down a sob and still smiled through the
mist that filmed her sight

In his face she could see how much he was moved at her distress Always
a creature of impulse one mastered her now the need to let her
weakness rest on his strength Her arms slipped quickly round his neck
and her head lay buried on his shoulder He held her tight eyes
shining the desire of her held in leash behind set teeth the while
sobs shook her soft round body in gusts

My lambmy sweet precious lamb she heard him murmur in anguish

From some deep sex trait it comforted her that he suffered With the
mother instinct she began to regain control of herself that she might
help him

It will not be for long she assured him And every step of your way
I shall pray for your safety she whispered

He held her at arms length while his gaze devoured her then silently
he wheeled away and plunged waist deep into the drifts As long as he
was in sight he saw her standing there waving her handkerchief to him
in encouragement Her slight dark figure outlined against the snow
was the last thing his eyes fell upon before he turned a corner of the
gulch and dropped downward toward the plains

But when he was surely gone after one fearful look at the white sea
which encompassed her the girl fled to the cabin slammed the door
after her and flung herself on the bed to weep out her lonely terror
in an ecstasy of tears She had spent the first violence of her grief
and was sitting crouched on the rug before the open fire when the sound
of a footstep crunching the snow startled her The door opened to
let in the man who had just left her

You are backalready she cried her tear stained face lifted
toward him

Yes he smiled from the doorway Come here little partner

And when she had obediently joined him her eye followed his finger up
the mountaintrail to a bend round which men and horses were coming

Its a reliefparty he said and caught up his fieldglasses to look
them over more certainly Two men on horseback leading a third animal
were breaking a way down the trail black spots against the background
of white I guess Fort Salvations about to be relieved he added
grimly following the party through the glasses

She touched the back of his hand with a finger Are you glad she
asked softly

No by Heaven he cried lowering his glasses swiftly

As he looked into her eyes the blood rushed to his brain with a surge
Her face turned to his unconsciously and their lips met

And I dont even know your name she murmured

Waring Ridgway and yours

Aline Hope she said absently Then a hot Rush ran over the girlish
face No no I had forgotten I was married last week

The gates of paradise open for two days clanged to on Ridgway He
stared out with unseeing eyes into the silent wastes of snow The
roaring in his ears and the mountainsides that churned before his eyes
were reflections of the blizzard raging within him

Ill never forgetnever he heard her falter and her voice was a
thousand miles away

From the storm within him he was aroused by a startled cry from the
girl at his side Her fascinated gaze was fixed on the summit of the
ridge above them There was a warning crackle The overhanging comb
snapped slid slowly down and broke off With gathering momentum it
descended sweeping into its heart rocks trees and debris A terrific
roar filled the air as the great white cloud came tearing down like an
expresstrain

Ridgway caught her round the waist and flung the girl against the wall
of the cabin protecting her with his body The avalanche was upon
them splitting great trees to kindlingwood in the fury of its rush
The concussion of the wind shattered every window to fragments almost
tore the cabin from its foundations Only the extreme tail of the slide
touched them yet they were buried deep in flying snow

He found no great difficulty in digging a way out and when he lifted
her to the surface she was conscious Yet she was pale even to the lips
and trembled like an aspen in the summer breeze clinging to him for
support helplessly

His cheerful voice rang like a bugle to her shocked brain

Its all past Were safe now dearquite safe

The first of the trailbreakers had dismounted and was plowing his way
hurriedly to the cabin but neither of them saw him as he came up the
slope

Are you sure She shuddered her hands still in his Wasnt it
awful I thought Her sentence trailed out unfinished

Are you unhurt Aline cried the newcomer And when he saw she was
he added Praise ye the Lord O give thanks unto the Lord for He is
good for His mercy endureth forever He saved them for His names
sake that He might make His mighty power to be known

At sound of the voice they turned and saw the man hurrying toward them
He was tall gray and seventy of massive frame and gaunt still
straight and vigorous with the hooked nose and piercing eyes of a
hawk At first glance he looked always the bird of prey but at the
next as invariably the wolf an effect produced by the salient reaching
jaw and the glint of white teeth bared for a lip smile Just now he was
touched to a rare emotion His hands trembled and an expression of
shaken thankfulness rested in his face

Aline still with Ridgways strong arms about her slowly came back to
the inexorable facts of life

Youhere

As soon as we could get throughand thank God in time

I would have died except for This brought her immediately to an
introduction and after she had quietly released herself the man who
had saved her heard himself being formally presented Mr Ridgway I
want you to meet my husband Mr Harley

Ridgway turned to Simon Harley a face of hammered steel and bowed
putting his hands deliberately behind his back

Ive been expecting you at Mesa Mr Harley he said rigidly Ill
be glad to have the pleasure of welcoming you there

The great financier was wondering where he had heard the mans name
before but he only said gravely You have a claim on me I can never
forget Mr Ridgway

Scornfully the other disdained this proffer Not at all You owe me
nothing Mr Harleyabsolutely nothing What I have done I have done
for her It is between her and me

At this moment the mind of Harley fitted the name Ridgway to its niche
in his brain So this was the audacious filibuster who had dared to
fire on the trust flag the man he had come West to ruin and to humble


I think you will have to include me Mr Ridgway he said suavely
What is done for my wife is done also for me



CHAPTER 6 ON THE SNOWTRAIL

Aline had passed into the house moved by an instinct which shrank from
publicity in the inevitable personal meeting between her and her
husband Now Harley with the cavalier nod of dismissal which only a
multimillionaire can afford followed her and closed the door A
passionate rush of blood swept Ridgways face He saw red as he stood
there with eyes burning into that door which had been shut in his face
The nails of his clenched fingers bit into his palms and his muscles
gathered themselves tensely He had been cast aside barred from the
woman he loved by this septuagenarian as carelessly as if he had no
claim

And it came home to him that now he had no claim none before the law
and society They had walked in Arcadia where shepherds pipe They had
taken life for granted as do the creatures of the woods forgetful of
the edicts of a world that had seemed far and remote But that world
had obtruded itself and shattered their dream In the person of Simon
Harley it had shut the door which was to separate him and her Hitherto
he had taken from life what he had wanted but already he was grappling
with the blind fear of a fate for once too strong for him

Well Im damned if it isnt Waring Ridgway called a mellow voice
from across the gulch

The man named turned and gradually the set lines of his jaw relaxed

I didnt notice it was you Sam Better bring the horses across this
side of that fringe of aspens

The dismounted horseman followed directions and brought the floundering
horses through and after leaving them in the cleared place where
Ridgway had cut his firewood he strolled leisurely forward to meet the
mineowner He was a youngish man broad of shoulder and slender of
waist a trifle bowed in the legs from much riding but with an elastic
sufficiency that promised him the man for an emergency a pledge which
his steady steelblue eyes with the humorous lines about the corners
served to make more valuable His apparel suggested the careless
efficiency of the cowman from the highheeled boots into which were
thrust his corduroys to the broadbrimmed white Stetson set on his
sunreddened wavy hair A mans man one would vote him at first sight
and subsequent impressions would not contradict the first

Didnt know you were down in this neck of woods Waring he said
pleasantly as they shook hands

An onlooker might have noticed that both of them gripped hands heartily
and looked each other squarely in the eye

I came down on business and got caught in the blizzard on my way back
Came on her freezing in the machine and brought her here along with me
I had my eye on that slide The snow up there didnt look good to me
and the grub was about out anyhow so I was heading for the C B Ranch
when I sighted you

Golden luck for her I knew it was a chance in a million that she was
still alive but Harley wanted to take it Say that old fellows made
of steel wire Two of my boys are plugging along a mile or two behind
us but he stayed right with the game to a finishand him
seventythree mind you and a New Yorker at that The old boy rides
like he was born in a saddle said Sam Yesler with enthusiasm

I never said he was a quitter conceded Ridgway ungraciously

Youre right he aint And say but hes fond of his wife Soon as he
struck the ranch the old man butted out again into the blizzard to get
herslipped out before we knew it The boys rounded him up wandering
round the big pasture and none too soon neither All the time we had
to keep herd on him to keep him from taking another whirl at it He was
like a crazy man to tackle it though he must aknown it was suicide
Funny how a man takes a shine to a woman and thinks the sun rises and
sets by her Far as I have been able to make out women are much of a
sameness though I aint setting up for a judge Like as not this woman
dont care a hands turn for him

Why should she He bought her with his millions I suppose What right
has an old man like that with one foot in the grave to pick out a child
and marry her I tell you Sam theres something ghastly about it

Oh well I reckon when she sold herself she knew what she was
getting Its about an even thingsix of one and half a dozen of the
other There must be something rotten about a woman who will do a thing
of that sort

Wait till youve seen her before passing judgment And after you have
youll apologize if youre a white man for thinking such a thing about
her the miner said hotly

Yesler looked at his friend in amiable surprise I dont reckon we
need to quarrel about Simon Harleys matrimonial affairs do we he
laughed

Not unless you want to say any harm of that lamb

A glitter of mischief gleamed from the cattlemans eyes Meaning
Harley Waring

You know who I mean I tell you shes an angel from heaven pure as
the driven snow

And I tell you that Ill take your word for it without quarreling with
you was the goodhumored retort Whats up anyhow I never saw you
so touchy before Youre a regular pepperbox

The rescuers had brought food with them and the party ate lunch before
starting back The cowpunchers of the C B had now joined them both of
them as well as their horses very tired with the heavy travel

This here Marathon race business through threefoot snow aint for
invalids like me and Husky one of them said cheerfully with his
mouth full of sandwich Were also rans and dont even show for
place

Yet though two of them had temporarily at least been rescued from
imminent danger and success beyond their expectations had met the
others it was a silent party A blanket of depression seemed to rest
upon it which the good stories of Yesler and the genial nonsense of
his man Chinn were unable to lift Three of them at least were
brooding over what the morning had brought forth and trying to realize
what it might mean for them

Wed best be going I expect said Yesler at last Weve got a right
heavy bit of work cut out for us and the horses are through feeding
We cant get started any too soon for me

Ridgway nodded silently He knew that the stockman was dubious as he
himself was about being able to make the return trip in safety The
horses were tired so too were the men who had broken the heavy trail
for so many miles with the exception of Sam himself who seemed built
of whipcord and elastic They would be greatly encumbered by the woman
for she would certainly give out during the journey The one point in
their favor was that they could follow a trail which had already been
trodden down

Simon Harley helped his wife into the boys saddle on the back of the
animal they had led but his inexperience had to give way to Yeslers
skill in fitting the stirrups to the proper length for her feet To
Ridgway who had held himself aloof during this preparation the
stockman now turned with a wave of his hand toward his horse

You ride Waring

No Im fresh

All right Well take turns

Ridgway led the party across the gulch following the trail that had
been swept by the slide The cowboys followed him next came Harley
his wife and in the rear the cattleman They descended the draw and
presently dipped over rolling ground to the plain beyond The
procession plowed steadily forward mile after mile the pomes
floundering through drifts after the man ahead

Chinn who had watched him breasting the soft heavy blanket that lay on
the ground so deep and hemmed them in turned to his companion

On the way coming I told you Husky we had the best man in Montana at
our head We got that beat now to a fareyouwell We got the two best
in this party by crickey

Hes got the guts all right but there aint nothing on two legs can
keep it up much longer replied the other If you want to know Im
about all in myself

Here too grunted the other And sos the bronc

It was not however until dusk was beginning to fall that the leader
stopped Yeslers voice brought him up short in his tracks

Hold on Waring The ladys down

Ridgway strode back past the exhausted cowboys and Harley the latter
so beaten with fatigue that he could scarce cling to the pommel of his
saddle

I saw it coming Shes been done for a long time but she hung on like
a thoroughbred explained Yesler from the snowbank where Aline had
fallen

He had her in his arms and was trying to get at a flask of whisky in
his hippocket

All right Ill take care of her Sam You go ahead with your horse
and break trail I dont like the way this wind is rising Its wiping
out the path you made when you broke through How fars the ranch now


Close to five miles

Both men had lowered their voices almost to a whisper

Its going to be a near thing Sam Your men are played out Harley
will never make it without help From now on every mile will be worse
than the last

Yesler nodded quietly Some one has got to go ahead for help Thats
the only way

It will have to be you of course You know the road best and can get
back quickest Better take her pony Its the fittest

The owner of the C B hesitated an instant before he answered He was
the last man in the world to desert a comrade that was down but his
common sense told him his friend had spoken wisely The only chance for
the party was to get help to it from the ranch

All right If anybody plays out beside her try to keep him going If
it comes to a showdown leave him for me to pick up Dont let him stop
the whole outfit

Sure Better leave me that bottle of whisky Solong

Youre going to ride I reckon

Yes Ill have to

Get up on my horse and Ill give her to you Thats right Well Ill
see you later

And with that the stockman was gone For long they could see him
plunging slowly forward through the drifts getting always smaller and
smaller till distance and the growing darkness swallowed him

Presently the girl in Ridgways arms opened her eyes

I heard what you and he said she told him quietly

About what he smiled down into the white face that looked up into
his

You know About our danger Im not afraid not the least little bit


You neednt be Were coming through all right Sam will make it to
the ranch Hes a man in a million

I dont mean that Im not afraid anyway whether we do or not

Why he asked his heart beating wildly

I dont know but Im not she murmured with drowsy content

But he knew if she did not Her fear had passed because he was there
holding her in his arms fighting to the last ounce of power in him for
her life She felt he would never leave her and that if it came to
the worst she would pass from life with him close to her Again he
knew that wild exultant beat of blood no woman before this one had ever
stirred in him

Harley was the first to give up He lurched forward and slipped from
the saddle to the snow and could not be cursed into rising The man
behind dismounted put down his burden and dragged the old man to his
feet

Here This wont do Youve got to stick it out

I cant Ive reached my limit Then testily Are not my days few
Cease then and let me alone he added wearily with his everready
tag of Scripture

The instant the others hold on him relaxed the old man sank back
Ridgway dragged him up and cuffed him like a troublesome child He knew
this was no time for reasoning

Are you going to lie down and quit you old loafer I tell you the
ranch is only a mile or two Here get into the saddle

By sheer strength the younger man hoisted him into the seat He was
very tired himself but the vital sap of youth in him still ran strong
in his blood For a few yards farther they pushed on before Harley slid
down again and his horse stopped

Ridgway passed him by guiding his bronco in a halfcircle through the
snow

Ill send back help for you he promised

It will be too late but save hersave her the old man begged

I will called back the other between set teeth

Chinn was the next to drop out and after him the one he called Husky
Both their horses had been abandoned a mile or two back too exhausted
to continue Each of them Ridgway urged to stick to the trail and come
on as fast as they could

He knew the horse he was riding could not much longer keep going with
the double weight and when at length its strength gave out completely
he went on afoot carrying her in his arms as on that eventful night
when he had saved her from the blizzard

It was so the rescueparty found him still staggering forward with her
like a man in a sleep flesh and blood and muscles all protestant
against the cruelty of his indomitable will that urged them on in spite
of themselves In a dream he heard Yeslers cheery voice gave up his
burden to one of the rescuers and found himself being lifted to a
fresh horse From this dream he awakened to find himself before the
great fire of the livingroom of the ranchhouse wakened from it only
long enough to know that somebody was undressing him and helping him
into bed

Nature with her instinct for renewing life saw to it that Ridgway
slept round the clock He arose fit for anything His body hard as
nails suffered no reaction from the terrific strain he had put upon
it and he went down to his breakfast with an appetite ravenous for
whatever good things Yeslers Chinese cook might have prepared for him


He found his host already at work on a juicy steak

Mornin nodded that gentleman Hope you feel as good as you look


Im all right barring a little stiffness in my muscles Ill feel
good as the wheat when Ive got outside of the twin steak to that one
you have

Yesler touched a bell whereupon a softfooted Oriental appeared
turned almond eyes on his proprietor took orders and padded silently
back to his kingdomthe kitchen Almost immediately he reappeared with
a bowl of oatmeal and a pitcher of cream

Go to it Waring

His host waved him the freedom of the diningroom and Ridgway fell to
Never before had food tasted so good He had been too sleepy to eat
last night but now he made amends The steak the muffins the coffee
were all beyond praise and when he came to the buckwheat hot cakes
sandwiched with butter and drenched with real maple syrup his
satisfied soul rose up and called Hop Lee blessed When he had
finished Sam capped the climax by shoving toward him his case of
Havanas

Ridgways eyes glistened I havent smoked for days he explained
and after the smoke had begun to rise he added Ask what you will
even to the half of my kingdom its yours

Or half of the Consolidateds amended his friend with twinkling eyes

Even so Sam returned the other equably And now tell me how you
managed to round us all up safely

Youve heard then that we got the whole party in time

Yes Ive been talking with one of your enthusiastic riders that went
out with you after us Hes been flimflammed into believing you the
greatest man in the United States Tell me how you do it

Nicks a good boy but I reckon he didnt tell you quite all that

Didnt he You should have heard him reel off your praises by the
yard I got the whole story of how you headed the reliefparty after
you had reached the ranch more dead than alive

Then if youve got it I dont need to tell you I WAS a bit worried
about the old man He was pretty far gone when we reached him but he
pulled through all right Hes still sleeping like a top

Is he His guests hard gaze came round to meet his And the lady
Do you know how she stood it

My sister says she was pretty badly played out but all she needs is
rest Nell put her in her own bed and she too has been doing nothing
but sleep

Ridgway smoked out his cigar in silence then tossed it into the
fireplace as he rose briskly

I want to talk to Mesa over the phone Sam

Cant do it The wires are down This storm played the deuce with
them

The devil Ill have to get through myself then

Forget business for a day or two Waring and take it easy up here
counseled his host

Cant do it I have to make arrangements to welcome Simon Harley to
Mesa The truth is Sam that there are several things that wont wait
Ive got to frame them up my way Can you get me through to the
railroad in time to catch the Limited

I think so The road has been traveled for two or three days If you
really must go I hate to have you streak off like this

Id like to stay Sam but I cant For one thing theres that
senatorial fight coming on Now that Harleys on the ground in person
Ill have to look after my fences pretty close Hes a good fighter
and hell be out to win

After what youve done for him Dont you think that will make a
difference Waring

His friend laughed without mirth What have I done for him I left him
in the snow to die and while a good many thousand other people would
bless me for it probably he has a different point of view

I was thinking of what you did for his wife

Youve said it exactly I did it for her not for him Ill accept
nothing from Harley on that account He is outside of the friendship
between her and me and he cant jimmy his way in

Yesler shrugged his shoulders All right Ill order a rig hitched for
you and drive you over myself I want to talk over this senatorial
fight anyhow The way things look now its going to be the rottenest
session of the legislature weve ever had Sometimes Im sick of being
mixed up in the thing but I got myself elected to help straighten out
things and Im certainly going to try

Thats right Sam With a few good fighters like you we can win out
Anything to beat the Consolidated

Anything to keep our politics decent corrected the other Ive got
nothing against the Consolidated but I wont lie down and let it or
any other private concern hogtie this Statenot if I can help it
anyhow

Behind wary eyes Ridgway studied him He was wondering how far this man
would go as his tool Sam Yesler held a unique position in the State
His influence was commanding among the sturdy oldtime population
represented by the nonmining interests of the smaller towns and open
plains He must be won at all hazards to lend it in the impending fight
against Harley The mineowner knew that no thought of personal gain
would move him He must be made to feel that it was for the good of the
State that the Consolidated be routed Ridgway resolved to make him see
it that way



CHAPTER 7 BACK FROM ARCADIA

The president of the Mesa Oreproducing Company stepped from the
parlorcar of the Limited at the hour when all wise people are taking
life easy after a good dinner He did not however drive to his club
but took a cab straight for his rooms where he had telegraphed Eaton
to meet him with the general superintendent of all his properties and
his private secretary Smythe For nearly a week his finger had been
off the pulse of the situation and he wanted to get in touch again as
soon as possible For in a struggle as tense as the one between him and
the trust a hundred vital things might have happened in that time He
might be coming back to catastrophe and ruin brought about while he
had been a prisoner to love in that snowbound cabin

Prisoner to love he had been and still was but the business men who
met him at his rooms fellow adventurers in the forlorn hope he had
hitherto led with such signal success could have read nothing of this
in the marble chiseled face of their sagacious general so indomitable
of attack and insatiate of success His steelhard eyes gave no hint of
the Arcadia they had inhabited so eagerly a short twentyfour hours
before The intoxicating madness he had known was chained deep within
him Once more he had a grip on himself was sheathed in a cannonproof
plate armor of selfishness No more magic nights of starshine
breathing fire and dew no more lifted moments of exaltation stinging
him to a pulsating wonder at lifes wild delight He was again the
inexorable driver of men with no pity for their weaknesses any more
than for his own

The men whom he found waiting for him at his rooms were all young
Westerners picked out by him because he thought them courageous
unscrupulous and loyal Like him they were privateers in the seas of
commerce and sailed under no flag except the one of insurrection he
had floated But all of them though they were associated with him and
hoped to ride to fortune on the wave that carried him there recognized
themselves as subordinates in the enterprises he undertook They were
merely heads of departments and they took orders like trusted clerks
with whom the owner sometimes unbends and advises

Now he heard their reports asked an occasional searching question and
swiftly gave decisions of farreaching import It was past midnight
before he had finished with them and instead of retiring for the sleep
he might have been expected to need he spent the rest of the night
inspecting the actual workings of the properties he had not seen for
six days Hour after hour he passed examining the developments
sometimes in the breasts of the workings and again consulting with
engineers and foremen in charge Light was breaking in the sky before
he stepped from the cage of the Jack Pot and boarded a streetcar for
his rooms Cornishmen and Hungarians and Americans going with their
dinnerbuckets to work met him and received each a nod or a word of
greeting from this splendidly built young Hermes in miners slops who
was to many of them in their fancy a deliverer from the slavery which
the Consolidated was ready to force upon them

Once at his rooms Ridgway took a cold bath dressed carefully
breakfasted and was ready to plunge into the mass of work which had
accumulated during his absence at the mining camp of Alpine and the
subsequent period while he was snowbound These his keen practical
mind grasped and disposed of in crisp sentences To his private
secretary he rapped out order sharply and decisively

Phone Ballard and Dalton I want to see them at once Tell Murphy I
wont talk with him What I said before I left was final Write
Cadwallader we cant do business on the terms he proposes but add that
Im willing to continue his Mary Kinney lease Dictate a letter to
Rileys lawyer telling him I cant afford to put a premium on
incompetence and negligence that if his client was injured in the Jack
Pot explosion he has nobody but himself to blame for it Otherwise of
course I should be glad to pension him Let me see the letter before
you send it I dont want anything said that will offend the union
Have two tons of good coal sent up to Rileys house and notify his
grocer that all bills for the next three months may be charged to me
And Smythe ask Mr Eaton to step this way

Stephen Eaton an alert cleareyed young fellow who served as fidus
Achates to Ridgway and was the secretary and treasurer of the Mesa
Oreproducing Company took the seat Smythe had vacated He was
goodlooking after a boyish undistinguished fashion but one disposed
to be critical might have voted the chin not quite definite enough He
had been a clerk of the Consolidated working for one hundred dollars a
month when Ridgway picked him out and set his feet in the way of
fortune He had done this out of personal liking and in return the
subordinate was frankly devoted to his chief

Steve my opinion is that Alpine is a false alarm Unless I guess
wrong it is merely a surface proposition and lowgrade at that

Miller says

Yes I know what Miller says Hes wrong I dont care if he is the
biggest copper expert in the country

Then you wont invest

I have investedbought the whole outfit lock stock and barrel

But why What do you want with it if the property is no good asked
Eaton in surprise

Ridgway laughed shortly I dont want it but the Consolidated does
Two of their experts were up at Alpine last week and both of them
reported favorably Ive let it leak out to their lawyer OMalley
that Miller thought well of it in fact I arranged to let one of their
spies steal a copy of his report to us

But when they know you have bought it

They wont know till too late I bought through a dummy It seemed a
pity not to let then have the property since they wanted it so badly
so this morning he sold out for me to the Consolidated at a profit of a
hundred and fifty thousand

Eaton grinned appreciatively It was in startling finesse of this sort
his chief excelled and Stephen was always ready with applause

I notice that Hobart slipped out of town last night That is where he
must have been going Hell be sick when he learns how you did him

Ridgway permitted himself an answering smile I suppose it will
irritate him a trifle but that cant be helped I needed that money to
get clear on that last payment for the Sherman Bell

Yes I was worried about that Notes have been piling up against us
that must be met Theres the Ransom note too Its for a hundred
thousand

Hell extend it said the chief confidently

He told me he would have to have his money when it came due Ive
noticed he has been pretty close to Mott lately I expect he has an
arrangement with the Consolidated to push us

Im watching him Steve Dont worry about that He did arrange to
sell the note to Mott but I stopped that little game

How

For a year Ive had all the evidence of that big government timber
steal of his in a safetydeposit vault Before he sold I had a few
words with him He changed his mind and decided he preferred to hold
the notes More he is willing to let us have another hundred thousand
if we have to have it

Eatons delight bubbled out of him in boyish laughter Youre a
wonder Waring Theres nobody like you Cant any of them touch
younot Harley himself by Jove

Well have a chance to find that out soon Steve

Yes they say hes coming out in person to run the fight against you
I hope not

It isnt a matter of hoping any longer Hes here calmly announced
his leader

Here On the ground

Yes

Buthe cant be here without us knowing it

Im telling you that I do know it

Have you seen him yourself demanded the treasurer incredulously

Seen him talked with him cursed him and cuffed him announced
Ridgway with a reminiscent gleam in his eye

Erwhats that you say gasped the astounded Eaton

Merely that I have already met Simon Harley

But you said

that I had cursed and cuffed him Thats all right I have

The president of the Mesa Oreproducing Company leaned back with his
thumbs in the armholes of his fancy waistcoat and smiled debonairly at
his associates perplexed amazement

Did you sayCUFFED him

Thats what I meant to say I roughed him around quite a
bitmanhandled him in general But all FOR HIS GOOD you know

For his good Eatons dazed brain tried to conceive the situation of
a billionaire being mauled for his good and gave it up in despair If
Steve Eaton worshipped anything it was wealth He was a born
sycophant and it was partly because his naive unstinted admiration had
contributed to satisfy his chiefs vanity that the latter had made of
him a confidant Now he sat dumb before the lesemajeste of laying
forcible hands upon the richest man in the world

But of course youre only joking he finally decided

You havent been back twelve hours Where COULD you have seen him

Nevertheless I have met him and been properly introduced by his wife

His wife

Yes I picked her out of a snowdrift

Is this a riddle

If it is I dont know the answer Steve But it is a true one
anyhow not made to order merely to astonish you

True that you picked Simon Harleys wife out of a snowdrift and
kicked him around

I didnt say kicked did I inquired the other judicially But I
rather think I did knee him some

Of course I read all about his marriage two weeks ago to Miss Aline
Hope Did he bring her out here with him for the honeymoon

If he did I euchred him out of it She spent it with me alone in a
miners cabin the other cried malevolence riding triumph on his face

Whenever youre ready to explain suggested Eaton helplessly Youve
piled up too many miracles for me even to begin guessing them

You know I was snowbound but you did not know my only companion was
this Aline Hope you speak of I found her in the blizzard and took her
to an empty cabin near She and her husband were motoring from
Avalanche to Mesa and the machine had broken down Harley had gone for
help and left her there alone when the blizzard came up Three days
later Sam Yesler and the old man broke trail through from the C B Ranch
and rescued us

It was so strange a story that it came home to Eaton piecemeal

Three daysalone with Harleys wifeand he rescued you himself

He didnt rescue me any I could have broken through any time I wanted
to leave her On the way back his strength gave out and that was when
I roughed him I tried to bullyrag him into keeping on but it was no
go I left him there and Sam went back after him with a reliefparty

You left him With his wife

No cried Ridgway Do I look like a man to desert a woman on a
snowtrail I took her with me

Oh There was a significant silence before Eaton asked the question
in his mind Ive seen her pictures in the papers Does she look like
them

His chief knew what was behind the question and he knew too that
Eaton might be taken to represent public opinion The world would cast
an eye of review over his varied and discreditable record with women
It would imagine the story of those three days of enforced confinement
together and it would look to the woman in the case for an answer to
its suspicions That she was young lovely and yet had sold herself to
an old man for his millions would go far in itself to condemn her and
he was aware that there were many who would accept her very childish
innocence as the sophistication of an artist

Waring Ridgway put his arms akimbo on the table and leaned across with
his steady eyes fastened on his friend

Steve Im going to answer that question I havent seen any pictures
of her in the papers but if they show a face as pure and true as the
face of God himself then they are like her You know me Ive got no
apologies or explanations to make for the life Ive led Thats my
business But youre my friend and I tell you I would rather be hacked
in pieces by Apaches than soil that childs white soul by a single
unclean breath There mustnt be any talk Do you understand Keep the
story out of the newspapers Dont let any of our people gossip about
it I have told you because I want you to know the truth If any one
should speak lightly about this thing stop him at once This is the one
point on which Simon Harley and I will pull together Any man who joins
that childs name with mine loosely will have to leave this campand
suddenly

It wont be the menit will be the women that will talk

Then garble the story Change that three days to three hours Steve
Anything to stop their foulclacking tongues

Oh well I dare say the story wont get out at all but if it does
Ill see the gossips get the right version I suppose Sam Yesler will
back it up

Of course Hes a white man And I dont need to tell you that Ill be
a whole lot obliged to you Stevie

Thats all right Sometimes Im a white man too Waring laughed
Steve Ridgway circled the table and put a hand on the younger mans
shoulder affectionately Steve Eaton was the one of all his associates
for whom he had the closest personal feeling

I dont need to be told that old pal he said quietly



CHAPTER 8 THE HONORABLE THOMAS B PELTON

It was next morning that Steve came into Ridgways offices with a copy
of the Rocky Mountain Herald in his hands As soon as the president of
the Mesa Oreproducing Company was through talking with Dalton the
superintendent of the Taurus about the best means of getting to the
cage a quantity of ore he was looting from the Consolidated property
adjoining the treasurer plumped out with his news

Seen todays paper Waring It smokes out Pelton to a finish Theyve
moled out some facts we cant get away from

Ridgway glanced rapidly over the paper Well have to drop Pelton and
find another candidate for the Senate Sorry but it cant be helped
Theyve got his record down too fine That affidavit from Quinton puts
an end to his chances

Hell kick like a bay steer

His own fault for not covering his tracks better This exposure
doesnt help us any at best If we still tried to carry Pelton we
should last about as long as a snowball in hell

Shall I send for him

No Hell be here as quick as he can cover the ground Have him shown
in as soon as he comes And Stevedid Harley arrive on the
eightthirty this morning

Yes He is putting up at the Mesa House He reserved an entire floor
by wire so that he has bedrooms diningrooms parlors
receptionhalls and private offices all together The place is policed
thoroughly and nobody can get up without an order

I havent been thinking of going up and shooting him even though it
would be a blessing to the country laughed his chief

No but it is possible somebody else might This town is full of
ignorant foreigners who would hardly think twice of it If he had asked
my advice it would have been to stay away from Mesa

He wouldnt have taken it returned Ridgway carelessly Whatever
else is true about him Simon Harley isnt a coward He would have told
you that not a sparrow falls to the ground without the permission of
the distorted God he worships and he would have come on the next
train

Well it isnt my funeral contributed Steve airily

All the same Im going to pass his police patrols and pay a visit to
the third floor of the Mesa House

You are going to compromise with him cried Eaton swiftly

Compromise nothing Im going to pay a formal social call on Mrs
Harley and respectfully hope that she has suffered no ill effects from
her exposure to the cold

Eaton made no comment unless to whistle gently were one

You think it isnt wise

Well is it asked Steve

I think so Well scotch the lying tongue of rumor by a strict
observance of the conventions Madam Grundy is padlocked when we reduce
the situation to the absurdity of the common place

Perhaps you are right if it doesnt become too common commonplace

I think we may trust Simon Harley to see to that answered his chief
with a grim smile Obviously our social relations arent likely to be
very intimate Now its Just before the battle mother but once the
big guns begin to boor well neither of us be in the mood for functions
social

Youve established a sort of claim on him It wouldnt surprise me if
he would meet you halfway in settling the trouble between you said
Eaton thoughtfully

I expect he would agreed Ridgway indifferently as he lit a cigar

Well then

The trouble is that I wont meet him halfway I cant afford to be
reasonable Steve Just suppose for an instant that I had been
reasonable five years ago when this fight began They would have bought
me out for a miserable pittance of a hundred and fifty thousand or so
That would have been a reasonable figure then You might put it now at
five or six millions and that would be about right I dont want their
money I want power and Id rather fight for it than not Besides I
mean to make what I have already wrung from them a lever for getting
more Im going to show Harley that he has met a man at last he cant
either freeze out or bully out Im going to let him and his bunch know
Im on earth and here to stay that I can beat them at their own game
to a finish

Did it ever occur to you Waring that it might pay to make this a
limited round contest Youve won on points up to date by a mile but
in a finish fight endurance counts Money is the same as endurance
here and thats where they are long

Eaton made this suggestion diffidently for though he was a stockholder
and official of the Mesa Oreproducing Company he was not used to
offering its head unasked advice The latter however took it without
a trace of resentment

Glad of it my boy Theres no credit in beating a cripple

To this jaunty retort Eaton had found no answer when Smythe opened the
door to announce the arrival of the Honorable Thomas B Pelton very
anxious for an immediate interview with Mr Ridgway

Show him in nodded the president adding in an aside You better
stay Steve

Pelton was a rotund oracular individual in silk hat and a Prince Albert
coat of broadcloth He regarded himself solemnly as a statesman because
he had served two inconspicuous terms in the House at Washington He
was fond of proclaiming himself a Southern gentleman part of which
statement was unnecessary and part untrue Like many from his section
he had a decided penchant for politics

Have you seen the infamous libel in that scurrilous sheet of the
gutters the Herald he demanded immediately of Ridgway

Which libel They dont usually stop at one colonel

The one seh which slanders my honorable name which has the
scoundrelly audacity to charge me with introducing the mining extension
bill for venal reasons seh

Oh Yes Ive seen that Rather an unfortunate story to come out just
now

I shall force a retraction seh or I shall demand the satisfaction
due a Southern gentleman

Yes I would colonel replied Ridgway secretly amused at the vain
threats of this bag of wind which had been punctured

Its a vile calumny an audacious and villainous lie

What part of it Ive just glanced over it but the part I read seems
to be true Thats the trouble with it If it were a lie you could
explode it

I shall deny it over my signature

Of course The trouble will be to get people to believe your denial
with Quintons affidavit staring them in the face It seems they have
got hold of a letter too that you wrote Deny it of course then lie
low and give the public time to forget it

Do you mean that I should withdraw from the senatorial race

Thats entirely as you please colonel but Im afraid youll find
your support will slip away from you

Do you mean that YOU wont support me seh

Ridgway locked his hands behind his head and leaned back in his chair
Weve got to face facts colonel In the light of this exposure you
cant be elected

But I tell you by Gad seh that I mean to deny it

Certainly I should in your place agreed the mineowner coolly The
question is how many people are going to believe you

Tiny sweatbeads stood on the forehead of the Arkansan His manner was
becoming more and more threatening You pledged me your support Are
you going to throw me down seh

You have thrown yourself down Pelton Is it my fault you bungled the
thing and left evidence against you Am I to blame because you wrote
incriminating letters

Whatever I did was done for you retorted the cornered man
desperately

I beg your pardon It was done for what was in it for you The
arrangement between us was purely a business one

The coolness of his even voice maddened the harassed Pelton

So Im to get burnt drawing your chestnuts out of the fire am I
Youre going to stand back and let my career be sacrificed are you By
Gad seh Ill show you whether Ill be your catspaw screamed the
congressman

Use your common sense Pelton and dont shriek like a fishwife
ordered Ridgway sharply No sane man floats a leaky ship Go to
drydock and patch up your reputation and in a few years youll come
out as good as new

All his unprincipled life Pelton had compromised with honor to gain the
coveted goal he now saw slipping from him A kind of madness of despair
surged up in him He took a step threateningly toward the seated man
his hand slipping back under his coattails toward his hip pocket
Acridly his high voice rang out

As a Southern gentleman seh I refuse to tolerate the imputations you
cast upon me I demand an apology here and now seh

Ridgway was on his feet and across the room like a flash

Dont try to bully ME you false alarm Call yourself a Southern
gentleman Youre a shallow scurvy impostor No more like the real
article than a buzzard is like an eagle Take your hand from under that
coat or Ill break every bone in your flabby body

Flabby was the word morally no less than physically Pelton quailed
under that gaze which bored into him like a gimlet The ebbing color in
his face showed he could summon no reserve of courage sufficient to
meet it Slowly his empty hand came forth

Dont get excited Mr Ridgway You have mistaken my purpose seh I
had no intention of drawing he stammered with a pitiable attempt at
dignity

Liar retorted his merciless foe crowding him toward the door

I dont care to have anything more to do with you Our relations are
at an end seh quavered Pelton as he vanished into the outer once and
beat a hasty retreat to the elevator

Ridgway returned to his chair laughing ruefully I couldnt help it
Steve He would have it I suppose Ive made one more enemy

A nasty one too Hell stick at nothing to get even

Well draw his fangs while there is still time Get a good story in
the Sun to the effect that I quarreled with him as soon as I discovered
his connection with this mining extension bill graft Have it in this
afternoons edition Steve Better get Brayton to write it

Steve nodded Thats a good idea We may make capital out of it after
all Ill have an editorial in too We love him for the enemies he
has made How would that do for a heading

Good And now well have to look around for a candidate to put against
Mott Im hanged if I know where well find one

Eaton had an inspiration

I do

One that will run well popular enough to catch the public fancy

Yes

Who then

Waring Ridgway

The owner of the name stared at his lieutenant in astonishment but
slowly the fascination of the idea sank in

By Jove Why not



CHAPTER 9 AN EVENING CALL

Says youre to come right up Mr Ridgway the bellhop reported and
after he had pocketed his tip went sliding off across the polished
floor to answer another call

The president of the Mesa Oreproducing Company turned with a
goodhumored smile to the chief clerk

You overwork your boys Johnson I wasnt through with that one Ill
have to ask you to send another up to show me the Harley suite

They passed muster under the eye of the chief detective and after the
bellboy had rung were admitted to the private parlor where Simon
Harley lay stretched on a lounge with his wife beside him She had been
reading evidently aloud and when her visitor was announced rose with
her finger still keeping the place in the closed book

The gaze she turned on him was of surprise almost of alarm so that
the man on the threshold knew he was not expected

You received my card he asked quickly

No Did you send one Then with a little gesture of halflaughing
irritation It must have gone to Mr Harvey again He is Mr Harleys
private secretary and ever since we arrived it has been a comedy of
errors The hotel force refuses to differentiate

I must ask you to accept my regrets for an unintentional intrusion
Mrs Harley When I was told to come up I could not guess that my card
had gone amiss

The great financier had got to his feet and now came forward with
extended hand

Nevertheless we are glad to see you Mr Ridgway and to get the
opportunity to express our thanks for all that you have done for us

The cool fingers of the younger man touched his lightly before they met
those of his wife

Yes we are very glad indeed to see you Mr Ridgway she added to
her husbands welcome

I could not feel quite easy in my mind without hearing from your own
lips that you are none the worse for the adventures you have suffered
their visitor explained after they had found seats

Thanks to you my wife is quite herself again Mr Ridgway Harley
announced from the davenport Thanks also to God who so mercifully
shelters us beneath the shadow of His wing

But her caller preferred to force from Alines own lips this affidavit
of health Even his audacity could not ignore his host entirely but it
gave him the least consideration possible To the question which still
rested in his eyes the girlwife answered shyly

Indeed I am perfectly well I have done nothing but sleep today and
yesterday Miss Yesler was very good to me I do not know how I can
repay the great kindness of so many friends she said with a swift
descent of fluttering lashes to the soft cheeks upon which a faint
color began to glow

Perhaps they find payment for the service in doing it for you he
suggested

Yet I shall take care not to forget it Harley said pointedly

Indeed Ridgway put it with polite insolence the hostility in his
face scarcely veiled

It has pleased Providence to multiply my portion so abundantly that I
can reward those well who serve me

At how much do you estimate Mrs Harleys life his rival asked with
quiet impudence

In the course of the past two days Aline had made the discovery that
her husband and her rescuer were at swords drawn in a business way
This had greatly distressed her and in her innocence she had resolved
to bring them together How could her inexperience know that she might
as well have tried to induce the lion and the lamb to lie down together
peaceably Now she tried timidly to drift the conversation from the
awkwardness into which Harleys suggestion of a reward and his
opponents curt retort had blundered it

I hope you did not find upon your return that your business was
disarranged so much as you feared it might be by your absence

I found my affairs in very good condition Ridgway smiled But I am
glad to be back in time to welcome to Mesa youand Mr Harley

It seems so strange a place the girl ventured with a hesitation
that showed her anxiety not to offend his local pride You see I never
before was in a place where there was no grass and nothing green in
sight And tonight when I looked out of the window and saw streams of
redhot fire running down hills I thought of Paradise Lost and Dante
I suppose it doesnt seem at all uncanny to you

At night sometimes I still get that feeling but I have to cultivate
it a bit he confessed My sober second thought insists that those
molten rivers are merely business refuse disgorged as lava from the
great smelters

I looked for the sun today through the pall of sulphur smoke that
hangs so heavy over the town but instead I saw a London gaslamp
hanging in the heavens Is it always so bad

Not when the drift of the wind is right In fact a day like this is
quite unusual

Im glad of that I feel more cheerful in the sunshine I know thats
a bit of the child still left in me Mr Harley takes all days alike

The Wall Street operator was in slippers and housejacket His wife
too was dressed comfortably in some soft clinging stuff Their visitor
saw that they had disposed themselves for a quiet uninterrupted evening
by the fireside The domesticity of it all stirred the envy in him He
did not want her to be contented and at peace with his enemy Something
deeper than his vanity cried out in protest against it

She was still making talk against the gloom of the sulphur fog which
seemed to have crept into the spirit of the room

We were reading before you came in Mr Ridgway I suppose you read a
good deal Mr Harley likes to have me read aloud to him when he is
tired

An impulse came upon Ridgway to hear her some such impulse as makes a
man bite on sore tooth even though he knows he must pay later for it

Will you not go on with your reading I should like to hear it I
really should

She was a little taken aback but she looked inquiringly at her
husband who bowed silently

I was just beginning the fiftyninth psalm We have been reading the
book through Mr Harley finds great comfort in it she explained

Her eyes fell to the printed page and her clear sweet voice took up
the ancient tale of vengeance

Deliver me from mine enemies O my God defend me from them that rise
up against me Deliver me from the workers of iniquity and save me
from bloody men

For lo they lie in wait for my soul the mighty are gathered against
me not for my transgression nor for my sin O Lord They run and
prepare themselves without my fault awake to help me and behold

Thou therefore O Lord God of Hosts the God of Israel awake to
visit all the heathen be not merciful to any wicked transgressors
Selah

Ridgway glanced across in surprise at the strong old man lying on the
lounge His hands were locked in front of him and his gaze rested
peacefully on the fair face of the child reading His foes mind swept
up the insatiable cruel years that lay behind this man and he marveled
that with such a past he could still hold fast to that simple faith of
David He wondered whether this ruthless spoiler went back to the Old
Testament for the justification of his life or whether his credo had
given the impulse to his career One thing he no longer doubted Simon
Harley believed his Bible implicitly and literally and not only the
New Testament

For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips even be taken
in their pride and for cursing and lying which they speak

Consume them in wrath consume them that they may not be and let
them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth

The fresh young girlish voice died away into silence Harley
apparently deep in meditation gazed at the ceiling His guest felt a
surge of derision at this man who thought he had a compact with God to
rule the world for his benefit

I am sure Mr Harley must enjoy the Psalms a great deal he said
ironically but it was in simple faith the young wife answered eagerly

He does He finds so much in them that is applicable to life

I can see how he might agreed the young man

Few people take their religion so closely into their everyday lives
as he does she replied in a low voice seeing that her husband was
lost in thought

I am sure you are right

He is very greatly misunderstood Mr Ridgway I am sure if people
knew how good he is But how can they know when the newspapers are so
full of falsehoods about him And the magazines are as bad he says It
seems to be the fashion to rake up bitter things to say about prominent
business men You must have noticed it

Yes I believe I have noticed that he answered with a grim little
laugh

Dont you think it could be explained to these writers They cant
WANT to distort the truth It must be they dont know

You must not take the muckrakers too seriously They make a living
roasting us A good deal of what they say is true in a way Personally
I dont object to it much Its a part of the penalty of being
successful Thats how I look at it

Do they say bad things about you too she asked in openeyed
surprise

Occasionally he smiled When they think Im important enough

I dont see how they can he heard her murmur to herself

Oh most of what they say is true

Then I know it cant be very bad she made haste to answer

You had better read it and see

I dont understand business at all she said

Butsometimes it almost frightens me Business isnt really like war
is it

A good deal like it But that need not frighten you All life is a
battlesometimes at least Success implies fighting

And does that in turn imply tragedyfor the loser

Not if one is a good loser We lose and make another start

But if success is a battle it must be gained at the expense of
another

Sometimes But you must look at it in a big way The secretary of the
trust magnate had come in and was in lowtoned conversation with him
The visitor led her to the nearest window and drew back the curtains so
that they looked down on the lusty life of the turbid young city at
the lights in the distant smelters and mills at the great hill
opposite with its slagdumps gallowsframes and shafthouses black
against the dim light which had yielded its millions and millions of
tons of ore for the use of mankind All this had to be fought for It
didnt grow of itself And because men fought for it the place is what
it is Sixty thousand people live here fed by the results of the
battle The highest wages in the world are paid the miners here They
live in rough comfort and plenty whereas in the countries they came
from they were underpaid and underfed Is that not good

Yes she admitted

Life for you and for me must be different thank God You are in the
world to make for the happiness of those you meet That is good But
unless I am to run away from my work what I do must make some unhappy
I cant help that if I am to do big things When you hear people
talking of the harm I do you will remember what I have told you
tonight and you will think that a man and his work cannot be judged
by isolated fragments

Yes she breathed softly for she knew that this man was saying
goodby to her and was making his apologia

And you will remember that no matter how bitter the fight may grow
between me and Mr Harley it has nothing to do with you We shall
still be friends though we may never meet again

I shall remember that too he heard her murmur

You have been hoping that Mr Harley and I would be friends That is
impossible He came out here to crush me For years his subordinates
have tried to do this and failed I am the only man alive that has ever
resisted him successfully I dont underestimate his power which is
greater than any czar or emperor that ever lived but I dont think he
will succeed I shall win because I understand the forces against me
He will lose because he scorns those against him

I am sorry Oh I am so sorry she wailed gently as a breath of
summer wind For she saw now that the cleavage between them was too
wide for a girls efforts to bridge

That I am going to win he smiled gravely

That you must be enemies that he came here to ruin you since you say
he did

You need not be too hard on him for that By his code I am a
freebooter and a highwayman Business offers legitimate ways of
robbery and I transgress them His ways are not my ways and mine are
not his but it is only fair to say that his are the accepted ones

I dont understand it at all You are both good men I know you are
Surely you need not be enemies

But she knew she could hope for no reassurance from the man beside her

Presently she led him back across the big room to the fireplace near
where her husband lay His secretary had gone and he was lying resting
on the lounge He opened his eyes and smiled at her Has Mr Ridgway
been pointing out to you the places of interest he asked quietly

Yes dear The last word came hesitantly after the slightest of
pauses He says he must be going now

The head of the greatest trust on earth got to his feet and smiled
benignantly as he shook hands with the departing guest I shall hope
to see you very soon and have a talk regarding business Mr Ridgway
he said

Whenever you like Mr Harley To the girl he said merely Good
night and was gone

The old man put an arm affectionately across his young wifes shoulder

Shall we read another psalm my dear Or are you tired

She repressed the little shiver that ran through her before she
answered wearily I am a little tired If you dont mind I would like
to retire please

He saw her as far as the door of her apartments and left her with her
maid after he had kissed the cold cheek she dutifully turned toward him



CHAPTER 10 HARLEY MAKES A PROPOSITION

Apparently the head of the great trust intended to lose no time in
having that business talk with Ridgway which he had graciously
promised the latter Eaton and his chief were busy over some
applications for leases when Smythe came into the room with a letter

Messengerboy brought it said it was important he explained

Ridgway ripped open the envelope read through the letter swiftly and
tossed it to Eaton His eyes had grown hard and narrow

Write to Mr Hobart that I am sorry I havent time to call on Mr
Harley at the Consolidated offices as he suggests Add that I expect
to be in my offices all morning and shall be glad to make an
appointment to talk with Mr Harley here if he thinks he has any
business with me that needs a personal interview

Smythes leathery face had as much expression as a blank wall but
Eaton gasped The unparalleled audacity of flinging the billionaires
overture back in his face left him for the moment speechless He knew
that Ridgway had tempted Providence a hundred times without coming to
disaster but surely this was going too far Any reasonable compromise
with the great trust builder would be cause for felicitation He had
confidence in his chief to any point in reason but he could not blind
himself to the fact that the wonderful successes he had gained were
provisional rather than final He likened them to Stonewall Jacksons
Shenandoah raid very successful in irritating disorganizing and
startling the enemy but with no serious bearing on the final
inevitable result In the end Harley would crush his foes if he set in
motion the whole machinery of his limitless resources That was Eatons
private opinion and he was very much of the feeling that this was an
opportune time to get in out of the rain

Dont you think we had better consider that answer before we send it
Waring he suggested in a low voice

His chief nodded a dismissal to the secretary before answering

I have considered it

Butsurely it isnt wise to reject his advances before we know what
they are

I havent rejected them Ive simply explained that we are doing
business on equal terms Even if I meant to compromise it would pay me
to let him know he doesnt own me

He may decide not to offer his proposition

It wouldnt worry me if he did

Eaton knew he must speak now if his protest were to be of any avail
It would worry me a good deal He has shown an inclination to be
friendly This answer is like a slap in the face

Is it

Doesnt it look like that to you

Ridgway leaned back in his chair and looked thoughtfully at his friend
Want to sell out Steve

Whywhat do you mean asked the surprised treasurer

If you do Ill pay anything in reason for your stock He got up and
began to pace the floor with long deliberate strides Im a born
gambler Steve It clears my head to take big chances Give me a good
fight on my hands with the chances against me and Im happy Youve
got to take the world by the throat and shake success out of it if
youre going to score heavily Thats how Harley made good years ago
Read the story of his life See the chances he took He throttled
combinations a dozen times as strong as his Some people say he was an
accident Dont you believe it Accidents like him dont happen He won
because he was the biggest brainiest most daring and unscrupulous
operator in the field Thats why Im going to winif I do win

Yes if you win

Well thats the chance I take flung back the other as he swung
buoyantly across the room But YOU dont need to take it If you want
you can get out now at the top market price I feel it in my bones Im
going to win but if you dont feel it youd be a fool to take
chances

Eatons mercurial temperament responded with a glow

No sir Ill sit tight Im no quitter

Good for you Steve I knew it Ill tell you now that I would have
hated like hell to see you leave me Youre the only man I can rely on
down to the ground twentyfour hours of every day

The answer was sent and Eatons astonishment at his chiefs temerity
changed to amazement when the great Harley pocketing his pride asked
for an appointment and appeared at the offices of the Mesa
Oreproducing Company at the time set That Ridgway who was busy with
one of his superintendents should actually keep the most powerful man
in the country waiting in an outer office while he finished his
business with Dalton seemed to him insolence florescent

Whom the gods would destroy he murmured to himself as the only
possible explanation for the reaction of his enthusiasm was on him

Nor did his chiefs conference with Dalton show any leaning toward
compromise Ridgway had sent for his engineer to outline a program in
regard to some oreveins in the Sherman Bell that had for months been
in litigation between the two big interests at Mesa Neither party to
the suit had waited for the legal decision but each of them had put a
large force at work stoping out the ore Occasional conflicts had
occurred when the men of the opposing factions came in touch as they
frequently did since crews were at work below and above each other at
every level But none of these as yet had been serious

Dalton I was down last night to see that lease of Heyburns on the
twelfth level of the Taurus The Consolidated will tap our workings
about noon today just below us I want you to turn on them the
airdrill pipe as soon as they break through Have a lot of loose rock
there mixed with a barrel of lime Let loose the air pressure full on
the pile and give it to their men straight Follow them up to the end
of their own tunnel when they retreat and hold it against them Get
control of the levels above and below too Throw as many men as you
can into their workings and gut them till there is no ore left

Dalton had the fighting edge Youll stand by me no matter what
happens

Nothing will happen Theyre not expecting trouble But if anything
does Ill see you through Eaton is your witness that I ordered it

Then its as good as done Mr Ridgway said Dalton turning away

There may be bloodshed suggested Eaton dubiously in a low voice

Ridgways laugh had a touch of affectionate contempt Dont cross
bridges till you get to them Steve Havent you discovered man that
the bold course is always the safe one Its the quitter that loses out
every time The strong man gets there the weak one falls down Its as
invariable as the law of gravity He got up and stretched his broad
shoulders in a deep breath Now for Mr Harley Send him in Eaton

That morning Simon Harley had done two things for many years foreign to
his experience He had gone to meet another man instead of making the
man come to him and he had waited the other mans pleasure in an outer
office That he had done so implied a strong motive

Ridgway waved Harley to a chair without rising to meet him The eyes of
the two men fastened wary and unwavering They might have been jungle
beasts of prey crouching for the attack so tense was their attention
The man from Broadway was the first to speak

I have called Mr Ridgway to arrange if possible a compromise I
need hardly say this is not my usual method but the circumstances are
extremely unusual I rest under so great a personal obligation to you
that I am willing to overlook a certain amount of youthful
presumption His teeth glittered behind a lip smile intended to give
the right accent to the paternal reproof My personal obligation

What obligation I left you to die in the snow

You forget what you did for Mrs Harley

You may eliminate that retorted the younger man curtly You are
under no obligations whatever to me

That is very generous of you Mr Ridgway but

Ridgway met his eyes directly cutting his sentence as with a knife
Generous is the last word to use It is not a question of generosity
at all What I mean is that the thing I did was done with no reference
whatever to you It is between me and her alone I refuse to consider
it as a service to you as having anything at all to do with you I
told you that before I tell you again

Harleys spirit winced This bold claim to a bond with his wife that
excluded him the scornful thrust of his enemyhe was already
beginning to consider him in that light rather than as a victimhad
touched the one point of human weakness in this moneymaking
Juggernaut He saw himself for the moment without illusions an old man
and an unlovable one without near kith or kin He was bitterly aware
that the child he had married had been sold to him by her guardian
under fear of imminent ruin before her ignorance of the world had
given her experience to judge for herself The money and the hidden
hunger of sentiment he wasted on her brought him only timid thanks and
wan obedience But for this man with his hateful confident youth he
had seen the warm smile touch her lips and the delicate color rose her
cheeks Nay he had seen more her arms around his neck and her warm
breath on his cheek They had lived romance these two in the days
they had been alone together They had shared danger and the joys of
that Bohemia of youth from which he was forever excluded It was his
resolve to wipe out by financial favorshe could ruin the fellow later
if need beany claims of Ridgway upon her gratitude or her foolish
imagination He did not want the mans appeal upon her to carry the
similitude of martyrdom as well as heroism

Yet the fact remains that it was a servicehis thin lips smiled I
must be the best judge of that I think I want to be perfectly frank
Mr Ridgway The Consolidated is an auxiliary enterprise so far as I am
concerned but I have always made it a rule to look after details when
it became necessary I came to Montana to crush you I have always
regarded you as a menace to our legitimate interests and I had quite
determined to make an end of it You are a good fighter and youve
been on the ground in person which counts for a great deal But you
must know that if I give myself to it in earnest you are a ruined man

The Westerner laughed hardily I hear you say it

But you dont believe added the other quietly Many men have heard
and not believed They have KNOWN when it was too late

If you dont mind Ill buy my experience instead of borrowing it
Ridgway flung back flippantly

One moment Mr Ridgway I have told you my purpose in coming to
Montana That purpose no longer exists Circumstances have completely
altered my intentions The finger of God is in it He has not brought
us together thus strangely except to serve some purpose of His own I
think I see that purpose The stone which the builders refused is
become the headstone of the corner This is the Lords doing it is
marvelous in our eyes he quoted unctiously I am convinced that it
is a waste of good material to crush you therefore I desire to effect
a consolidation with you buy all the other copper interests of any
importance in the country and put you at the head of the resulting
combination

In spite of himself Ridgways face betrayed him It was a magnificent
opportunity the thing he had dreamed of as the culmination of a
lifetime of fighting Nobody knew better than he on how precarious a
footing he stood on how slight a rock his fortunes might be wrecked
Here was his chance to enter that charmed impregnable inner circle of
finance that in effect ruled the nation That Harleys suave
friendliness would bear watching he did not doubt for a moment but
once inside so his vital youth told him proudly he would see to it
that the billionaire did not betray him A week ago he could have asked
nothing better than this chance to bloat himself into a someday
colossus But now the thing stuck in his gorge He understood the
implied obligation Payment for his service to Aline Harley was to be
given and the ledger balanced Well why not Had he not spent the
night in a chaotic agony of renunciation But to renounce voluntarily
was one thing to be bought off another

He looked up and met Harleys thin smile the smile that on Wall Street
was a synonym for rapacity and heartlessness in the memory of which
men had committed murder and suicide On the instant there jumped
between him and his ambition the face that had worked magic on him
What a Gods pity that such a lamb should be cast to this ravenous
wolf He felt again her arms creeping round his neck the divine trust
of her lovely eyes He had saved her when this man who called himself
her husband had left her to perish in the storm He had made her happy
as she had never been in all her starved life Had she not promised
never to forget and was there not a deeper promise in her wistful eyes
that the years could not wipe out She was his by every right of
natural law By God he would not sell his freedom of choice to this
white haired robber

I seldom make mistakes in my judgment of men Mr Ridgway the oily
voice ran on No small share of such success as it has been given me
to attain has been due to this instinct for putting my finger on the
right man I am assured that in you I find one competent for the great
work lying before you The opportunity is waiting I furnish it and
you the untiring energy of youth to make the most of the chance His
wolfish smile bared the tusks for a moment I find myself not so young
as I was The great work I have started is well under way I must trust
its completion to younger and stronger hands than mine I intend to
rest to devote myself to my home more directly to such philanthropic
and educational work as God has committed to my hands

The Westerner gave him look for look his eyes burning to get over the
impasse of the expressionless mask no man had ever penetrated He began
to see why nobody had ever understood Harley He knew there would be no
rest for that consuming energy this side of the grave Yet the man
talked as if he believed his own glib lies

Consolidated is the watchword of the age it means elimination of
ruinous competition and consequent harmony and reduced expense in
management Mr Ridgway may I count you with us Together we should go
far Do you say peace or war

The younger man rose leaning forward with his strong sinewy hands
gripping the table His face was pale with the repression of a rage
that had been growing intense I say war and without quarter I dont
believe you can beat me I defy you to the test And if you
shouldeven then I had rather go down fighting you than win at your
side

Simon Harley had counted acceptance a foregone conclusion but he never
winked a lash at the ringing challenge of his opponent He met his
defiance with an eye cold and steady as jade

As you please Mr Ridgway I wash my hands of your ruin and when you
are nothing but a broken gambler you will remember that I offered you
the greatest chance that ever came to a man of your age You are one of
those men I see that would rather be first in hell than second in
heaven So be it He rose and buttoned his overcoat

Say rather that I choose to go to hell my own master and not as the
slave of Simon Harley retorted the Westerner bitterly

Ridgways eyes blazed but those of the New Yorker were cool and fishy

There is no occasion for dramatics he said the cruel passionless
smile at his thin lips I make you a business proposition and you
decline it That is all I wish you good day

The other strode past him and flung the door open He had never before
known such a passion of hatred as raged within him Throughout his life
Simon Harley had left in his wake wreckage and despair He was the
besthated man of his time execrated by the working classes despised
by the country at large and distrusted by his fellow exploiters Yet
as a business opponent Ridgway had always taken him impersonally had
counted him for a condition rather than an individual But with the new
influence that had come into his life reason could not reckon and
when it was dominant with him Harley stood embodied as the wolf ready
to devour his ewe lamb

For he couldnt get away from her Wherever he went he carried with him
the picture of her sweet shy smile her sudden winsome moments the
deep light in her violet eyes and in the background the sinister bared
fangs of the wild beast dogging her patiently and yet lovingly



CHAPTER 11 VIRGINIA INTERVENES

James K Mott local chief attorney for the Consolidated was
struggling with a white tie before the glass and crumpling it
atrociously

This dresssuit habit is the most pernicious I know Its sapping the
liberties of the American people he grunted at last in humorous
despair

Let me dear

His wife tied it with neatness and dispatch and returned to the
inspection of how her skirt hung

Mr Harley asked me to thank you for calling on his wife He says she
gets lonesome during the day while he is away so much I was wondering
if you couldnt do something for her so that she could meet some of the
ladies of Mesa A luncheon or something of that sort you know Have
you seen my hatbrush anywhere

Its on that drawer beside your hatbox She told me she would rather
not I suggested it But Ill tell you what I could do take Virginia
Balfour round to see her Shes lively and good company and knows some
of the people Mrs Harley knows

Thats a good idea I want Harley to know that we appreciate his
suggestions and are ready to do our part He has shown a disposition
to consult me on a good many things that ought to lie in Hobarts
sphere rather than mine Somethings going to drop Now I like Hobart
but I want to show myself in a receptive mood for advancement when his
head falls as it certainly will soon

     

Virginia responded eagerly to Mrs Motts suggestion that they call
together on Mrs Harley at the hotel

My dear you have saved my life Ive been dying of curiosity and I
havent been able to find vestige of an excuse to hang my call on I
couldnt ask Mr Ridgway to introduce me could I

No I dont see that you could smiled Mrs Mott a motherly little
woman with pleasant brown eyes I suppose Mr Ridgway isnt exactly on
calling terms with Mr Harleys wife even if he did save her life

Oh Mr Ridgway isnt the man to let a little thing like a war a
outrance stand in the way of his social duties especially when those
duties happen to be inclinations too I understand he DID call the
evening of their arrival here

He didnt screamed Mrs Mott who happened to possess a voice of the
normal national register And what did Mr Harley say

Ah thats what one would like to know My informant deponeth not
beyond the fact unadorned One may guess there must have been
undercurrents of embarrassment almost as pronounced as if the President
were to invite his Ananias Club to a pink tea I can imagine Mr Harley
saying Try this cake Mr Ridgway it isnt poisoned and Mr
Ridgway answering Thanks After you my dear Gaston

Miss Balfours anxiety to meet the young woman her fiance had rescued
from the blizzard was not unnatural Her curiosity was tinged with
frank envy though jealousy did not enter into it at all Virginia had
come West explicitly to take the country as she found it and she had
found it unfortunately no more hazardous than little old New York
though certainly a good deal more diverting to a young woman with
democratic proclivities that still survived the energetic weeding her
training had subjected them to

She did not quite know what she had expected to find in Mesa Certainly
she knew that Indians were no longer on the map and cowboys were
kicking up their last dust before vanishing but she had supposed that
they had left compensations in their wake On the principle that
adventures are to the adventurous her life should have been a whirl of
hairbreadth escapes

But what happened She took all sorts of chances without anything
coming of it Her pirate fiance was the nearest approach to an
adventure she had flushed and this pinkandwhite chit of a married
schoolgirl had borrowed him for the most splendid bit of excitement
that would happen in a hundred years She had been spinning around the
country in motorcars for months without the sign of a blizzard but
the chit had hit one the first time It wasnt fair That was her
blizzard by rights In spirit at least she had spoken for it as
she and her brother used to say when they were children of some coveted
treasure not yet available Virginia was quite sure that if she had
seen Waring Ridgway at the inspired moment when he was plowing through
the drifts with Mrs Harley in his armsonly of course it would have
been she instead of Mrs Harley and he would not have been carrying
her so long as she could stand and take itshe would have fallen in
love with him on the spot And those two days in the cabin on
halfration they would have put an end forever to her doubts and to
that vision of Lyndon Hobart that persisted in her mind What luck
glace some people did have

But Virginia discovered the chit to be rather a different personality
than she had supposed In truth she lost her heart to her at once She
could have stood out against Alines mere good looks and been the
stiffer for them She was no MAN to be moved by the dark hairs dusky
glory the charm of soft girlish lines the effect of shy
unsophistication that might be merely the highest art of social
experience But back of the sweet trembling mouth that seemed to be
asking to be kissed of the pathetic appeal for friendliness from the
big deep violet eyes was a quality of soul not to be counterfeited
Miss Balfour had furbished up the distant hauteur of the society manner
she had at times used effectively but she found herself instead taking
the beautiful forlorn little creature in her arms

Oh my dear my dear how glad I am that dreadful blizzard did not
hurt you

Aline clung to this gracious young queen as if she had known her a
lifetime You are so good to me everybody is You know how Mr Ridgway
saved me If it had not been for him I should have died I didnt
careI wanted to die in peace I thinkbut he wouldnt let me

I should think not

If you only knew himperhaps you do

A little confessed Virginia with a flash of merry eyes at Mrs Mott

He is the bravest manand the strongest

Yes He is both agreed his betrothed with pride

His tenderness his unselfishness his consideration for othersdid
you ever know anybody like him for these things

Never agreed Virginia with the mental reservations that usually
accompanied her skeptical smile She was getting at her fiance from a
novel point of view

And so modest with all his strength and courage

Its almost a fault in him she murmured

The woman that marries him will be blessed among women

I count it a great privilege said Miss Balfour absently but she
pulled up with a hurried addendum To have known him

Indeed yes If one met more men like him this would be a better
world

It would certainly be a different world

It was a relief to Aline to talk to put into words the external
skeleton facts of the surging current that had engulfed her existence
since she had turned a corner upon this unexpected consciousness of
life running strong and deep Harley was not a confidant she could have
chosen under the most favorable circumstances and her instinct told
her that in this matter he was particularly impossible But to Virginia
BalfourMrs Mott had to leave early to preside over the Mesa Womans
Club and her friend allowed herself to be persuaded to stay
longershe did not find it at all hard to talk Indeed she murmured
into the sympathetic ear of this astute young searcher of hearts more
than her words alone said with the result that Virginia guessed what
she herself had not yet quite found out though her heart was hovering
tremblingly on the brink of discovery

But Virginias sympathy for the trouble fate had in store for this
helpless innocent consisted with an alert appreciation of its obvious
relation to herself What she meant to discover was the attitude toward
the situation of one neither particularly innocent nor helpless Was
he too about to be caught in the coil of a Gods romances or was
he merely playing on the vibrating strings of an untaught heart

It was in part to satisfy this craving for knowledge that she wrote
Ridgway a note as soon as she reached home It said


MY DEAR RECREANT LAGGARD If you are not too busy playing Sir Lancelot
to fair dames in distress or splintering lances with the doughty
husbands of these same ladies I pray you deign to allow your servant
to feast her eyes upon her lords face Hopefully and gratefully yours
VIRGINIA

P SHave you forgotten sir that I have not seen you since that
terrible blizzard and your dreadful imprisonment in Fort Salvation

P P SI have seen somebody else though Shes a dear and full of
your praises I hardly blame you

V


She thought that ought to bring him soon and it did

Ive been busy night and day he apologized when they met

Virginia gave him a broadside demurely

I suppose your social duties do take up a good deal of your time

My social duties Oh I see He laughed appreciation of her hit
Evidently through her visit she knew a good deal more than he had
expected Since he had nothing to hide from her except his feelings
this did not displease him My duties in that line have been confined
to one formal call

She sympathized with him elaborately Calls of that sort do bore men
so Ill not forget the first time you called on me

Nor I he came back gallantly

I marveled how you came through alive but I learned then that a man
cant be bored to death

I came again nevertheless he smiled And againand again

I am still wondering why

 Oh wad some power the giffie gite us
 To see ourselves as others see us

he quoted with a bow

Is that a compliment she asked dubiously

I have never heard it used so before Anyhow it is a little hackneyed
for anybody so original as you

It was the best I could do offhand

She changed the subject abruptly Has the new campaign of the war
begun yet

Well were maneuvering for position

Youve seen him How does he impress you

The same as he does others A hard ruthless fighter Unless all signs
fail he is an implacable foe

But you are not afraid

He smiled Do I look frightened

No you remind me of something a burglar once told me

A what

A burglara reformed burglar She gave him a saucy flash of her dark
eyes Do you think I dont know any lawbreakers except those I have
met in this State I came across this one in a mission where I used to
think I was doing good He said it was not the remuneration of the
profession that had attracted him but the excitement It was
dreadfully frowned down upon and underpaid He could earn more at his
old trade of a locksmith but it seemed to him that every impediment to
success was a challenge to him Poor man he relapsed again and they
put him in Sing Sing I was so interested in him too

Youve had some queer friends in your time he laughed but without a
trace of disapproval

I have some queer ones yet she thrust back

Lets not talk of them he cried in pretended alarm

Her inextinguishable gaiety brought back the smile he liked Well
talk of SOME ONE elsesome one of interest to us both 

I am always ready to talk of Miss Virginia Balfour he said
misunderstanding promptly

She smiled her disdain of his obtuseness in an elaborately long survey
of him

Well he wanted to know

Thats how you lookvery well indeed I believe the storm was
greatly exaggerated she remarked

Isnt that rather a good definition for a blizzarda greatly
exaggerated storm

You dont look the worse for wearnot the wreck I expected to behold

Ah you should have seen me before I saw you

Thank you I have no doubt you find the sight of my dear face as
refreshing as your favorite cocktail I suppose that is why it has
taken you three days after your return to reach me and then by special
request

A pleasure delayed is twice a pleasure anticipation and realization

Miss Balfour made a different application of his text her eyes trained
on him with apparent indifference Ive been enjoying a delayed
pleasure myself I went to see her this afternoon

He did not ask whom but his eyes brightened

Shes worth a good deal of seeing dont you think

Oh Im in love with her but it doesnt follow you ought to be

Am Ihe smiled

You are either in love or else you ought to be ashamed of yourself

An interesting thing about you is your point of view Now anybody
else would tell me I ought to be ashamed if I am in love

Im not worried about your morals she scoffed Its that poor child
Im thinking of

I think of her a good deal too

Ah and does she think of you a good deal Thats what we must guard
against

Is it

Yes You see Im her confidante She told it him with sparkling eyes
for the piquancy of it amused her Not every engaged young woman can
hear her lovers praises sung by the woman whose life he has saved with
the proper amount of romance

Really

She nodded laughing at him I didnt get a chance to tell her about
me

I suppose not

I think Ill tell her about you thoughjust what a ruthless
barbarian you are

His eyes gleamed I wish you would Id like to find out whether she
would believe you I have tried to tell her myself but the honest
truth is I funk it

You havent any right to let her know you are interested in her She
interrupted him before he could speak Dont trifle with her Waring
Shes not like other girls

He met her look gravely I wouldnt trifle with her for any reason

Her quick rejoinder overlapped his sentence Then you love her

Is that an alternative

With youyes

Faith my lady youre frank

Im not mealymouthed You dont think yourself scrupulous do you

Im afraid I am not

I dont mind so much your being in love with HER though its not
flattering to my vanity but She stopped letting him make the
inference

Do you think that likely he asked the color flushing his face

He wondered how much Aline had told this confidante Certain specific
things he knew she had not revealed but had she let her guess the
situation between them

She compromised with her conscience I dont know She is
romanticand Simon Harley isnt a very fertile field for romance I
suppose

You would imply

Oh you have points and nobody knows them better than Waring
Ridgway she told him jauntily But you neednt play that role to the
address of Aline Harley Try ME Im immune to romance Besides Im
engaged to you she added laughing at the inconsequence the fact
seemed to have for both of them

Im afraid I cant help the situation for if Ive been playing a
part it has been an unconscious one

Thats the worst of it When you star as Waring Ridgway you are most
dangerous What I want is total abstinence

Youd rather I didnt see her at all

Virginia dimpled a gleam of reminiscent laughter in her eyes When I
was in Denver last month a Mrs Smytheit was Smith before her husband
struck it rich last yearsent out cards for a bridge afternoon A Mrs
Mahoney had just come to the metropolis from the wilds of Cripple
Creek Her husband had struck a goldmine too and Mr Smythe was
under obligations to him Anyhow she was a stranger and Mrs Smythe
took her in It was Mrs Mahoneys introduction to bridge and she did
not know she was playing for keeps When the afternoon was over Mrs
Smythe hovered about her with the sweetest sympathy So sorry you had
such a horrid run of cards dear Better luck next time It took Mrs
Mahoney some time to understand that her social afternoon had cost one
hundred and twenty dollars but next day her husband sent a check for
one hundred and twentytwo dollars to Mrs Smythe The extra two
dollars were for the refreshments he naively explained adding that
since his wife was so poor a gambler as hardly to be able to keep
professionals interested he would not feel offended if Mrs Smythe
omitted her in future from her social functions

Ridgway took it with a smile Simon Harley brought his one hundred and
twentytwo dollars in person

He didnt When

This morning He proposed benevolent assimilation as a solution of our
troubles

Just how

He offered to consolidate all the copper interests of the country and
put me at the head of the resulting combine

If you wouldnt play bridge with Mrs Harley

Exactly

And you

Declined to pledge myself

She clapped her hands softly Well done Waring Ridgway There are
times when you are magnificent when I could put you on a pedestal you
great big unafraid man But you mustnt play with her just the same

Why mustnt I

For her sake

He frowned past her into space his tightshut jaw standing out
saliently Youre right Virginia Ive been thinking so myself Ill
keep off the grass he said at last

Youre a good fellow slipped out impulsively

Well I know where theres another he said I ought to think myself
a lucky dog

Virginia lifted quizzical eyebrows Ought to That tastes of duty
Dont let it come to that Well take it off if you like She touched
the solitaire he had given her

Ah but I dont likehe smiled



CHAPTER 12 ALINE MAKES A DISCOVERY

Aline pulled her horse to a walk You know Mr Ridgway pretty well
dont you

Miss Balfour gently flicked her divided skirt with a ridingwhip
considering whether she might be said to know him well Yes I think I
do she ventured

Mrs Mott says you and he are great friends that you seem very fond
of each other

Goodness me I hope I dont seem fond of him I dont think fond is
exactly the word anyway though we are good friends Quickly keenly
her covert glance swept Aline then withdrawing her eyes she flung
her little bomb I suppose we may be said to appreciate each other At
any rate we are engaged

Mrs Harleys pony came to an abrupt halt I thought I had dropped my
whip she explained in a low voice not quite true

Virginia though she executed an elaborate survey of the scenery could
not help noticing that the color had washed from her friends face I
love this Western countryits big sweep of plains of low rolling
hills with a background of mountains One can see how it gets into a
mans blood so that the East seems insipid ever afterward discoursed
Miss Balfour

A question trembled on Alines blanched lips

Say it permitted Virginia

Do you mean that you are engaged to himthat you are going to marry
Mr Ridgwaywithout caring for him

I dont mean that at all I like him immensely

Butdo you love him It was almost a crythese low words wrung from
the tortured heart

No fair warned her friend smilingly

Aline rode in silence her stricken face full of trouble How could
she from her glass house throw stones at a loveless marriage But
this was different from her own case Nobody was worthy to marry her
hero without giving the best a woman had to give If she were a girla
sudden tide of color swept her face a wild delirious tingle of joy
flooded her veinsoh if she were a girl what a wealth of love could
she give him Clarity of vision had come to her in a blinding flash
Untutored of life the knowledge of its meaning had struck home of the
suddenest She knew her heart now that it was too late knew that she
could never be indifferent to what concerned Waring Ridgway

Aline caught at the courage behind her childishness and accomplished
her congratulations You will be happy I am sure He is good

Goodness does not impress me as his most outstanding quality smiled
Miss Balfour

No one never feels it emphasized He is too free of selfishness
to make much of his goodness But one cant help feeling it
in everything he does and says

Does Mr Harley agree with you Does he feel it

I dont think Mr Harley understands him I cant help thinking that
he is prejudiced She was becoming mistress of her voice and color
again

And you are not

Perhaps I am In my thought of him he would still be good even if he
had done all the bad things his enemies accuse him of

Virginia gave her up This idealized interpretation of her betrothed
was not the one she had but for Aline it might be the true one At
least she could not disparage him very consistently under the
circumstances

Isnt there a philosophy current that we find in people what we look
for in them Perhaps that is why you and Mr Harley read in Mr Ridgway
men so diverse as you do It is not impossible you are both right and
both wrong Heaven knows I suppose At least we poor mortals fog
around enough when we sit in judgment And Virginia shrugged the
matter from her careless shoulders

But Aline seemed to have a difficulty in getting away from the subject
And youwhat do you read she asked timidly

Sometimes one thing and sometimes another Today I see him as a
living refutation of all the copybook rules to success He shatters
the maxims with a touchandgo manner that is fascinating in its
immorality A gambler a plunger an adventurer he wins when a
careful honest business man would fail to a certainty

Aline was amazed You misjudge him I am sure you do But if you think
this of him why

Why do I marry him I have asked myself that a hundred times my dear
I wish I knew I have told you what I see in him today but
tomorrowwhy tomorrow I shall see him an altogether different man
He will be perhaps a radiating center of altruism devoted to his
friends a levelheaded protector of the working classes a patron of
the arts in his own clearminded unlettered way But whatever point of
view one gets at him he spares one dullness Will you explain to me
my dear why picturesque rascality is so much more likable than humdrum
virtue

Mrs Harleys eyes blazed And you can talk this way of the man you
are going to marry a man She broke off her voice choked

Miss Balfour was cool as a custard I can my dear and without the
least disloyalty In point of fact he asked me to tell you the kind of
man I think him Im trying to oblige him you see

He asked youto tell me this about him Aline pulled in her pony in
order to read with her astonished eyes the amused ones of her companion

Yes He was afraid you were making too much of his saving you He
thinks he wont do to set on a pedestal

Then I think all the more of him for his modesty

Dont invest too heavily on his modesty my dear He wouldnt be the
man he is if he owned much of that commodity

The man he is

Yes the man born to win the man certain of himself no matter what
the odds against him He knows he is a man of destiny knows quite well
that there is something big about him that dwarfs other men I know it
too Wherefore I seize my opportunity It would be a sin to let a man
like that get away from one I could never forgive myself she
concluded airily

Dont you see any human lovable things in him Alines voice was an
accusation

He is the staunchest friend conceivable No trouble is too great for
him to take for one he likes and where once he gives his trust he does
not take it back Oh for all his force he is intensely human Take
his vanity my dear It soars to heaven

If I cared for him I couldnt dissect his qualities as you do

Thats because you are a triumph of the survival of nature and impulse
over civilization in spite of its attempts to sap your freshness For
me I fear Im a sophisticated daughter of a critical generation If I
werent I should not hold my judgment so safely in my own keeping but
would surrender it and my heart

There is something about the way you look at him that shocks me One
ought not to let oneself believe all that seems easy to believe

That is your faith but mine is a different one You see Im a
Unitarian returned Virginia blithely

He will make you love him if you marry him sighed Aline coming back
to her obsession

Virginia nodded eagerly In my secret heart that is what I am hoping
for my dear

Unless there is another man added Aline as if alone with her
thoughts

Virginia was irritably aware of a flood of color beating into her
cheeks There isnt any other man she said impatiently

Yet she thought of Lyndon Hobart Curiously enough whenever she
conceived herself as marrying Ridgway the reflex of her brain carried
to her a picture of Hobart cleanhanded fine of instinct with the
inherited inflections of voice and unconscious pride of caste that come
from breeding and not from cultivation If he were not born to
greatness like his rival at least he satisfied her critical judgment
of what a gentleman should be and she was quite sure that the
potential capacity lay in her to care a good deal more for him than for
anybody else she had met Since it was not on the cards as Miss
Virginia had shuffled the pack that she should marry primarily for
reasons sentimental this annoyed her in her sophisticated hours

But in the hours when she was a mere girl when she was not so
confidently the heir of all the feminine wisdom of the ages her
annoyance took another form She had told Lyndon Hobart of her
engagement because it was the honest thing to do because she supposed
she ought to discourage any hopes he might be entertaining But it did
not follow that he need have let these hopes be extinguished so
summarily She could have wished his scrupulous regard for the proper
thing had not had the effect of taking him so completely out of her
external life while leaving him more insistently than ever the subject
of her inner contemplation

Virginias conscience was of the twentieth century and American though
she was a good deal more honest with herself than most of her sex in
the same social circle Also she was straightforward with her neighbors
so far as she could reasonably be But she was not a Puritan in the
least though she held herself to a more rigid account than she did her
friends She judged her betrothed as little as she could but this was
not to be entirely avoided since she expected her life to become
merged so largely in his There were hours when she felt she must
escape the blighting influence of his lawlessness There were others
when it seemed to her magnificent

Except for the occasional jangle of a bit or the ring of a horses shoe
on a stone there was silence which lasted many minutes Each was busy
with her thoughts and the narrowness of the trail which here made
them go in single file served as an excuse against talk

Perhaps we had better turn back suggested Virginia after the path
had descended to a gulch and merged itself in a wagonroad We shall
have no more than time to get home and dress for dinner

Aline turned her pony townward and they rode at a walk side by side

Do you know much about the difficulty between Mr Harley and Mr
Ridgway I mean about the minesthe Sherman Bell I think they called
it

I know something about the trouble in a general way Both the
Consolidated and Mr Ridgways company claim certain veins That is
true of several mines I have been told

I dont know anything about business Mr Harley does not tell me
anything about his To day I was sitting in the open window and two
men stopped beneath it They thought there would be trouble in this
minethat men would be hurt I could not make it all out but that was
part of it I sent for Mr Harley and made him tell me what he knew It
would be dreadful if anything like that happened

Dont worry your head about it my dear Things are always threatening
and never happening It seems to be a part of the game of business to
bluff as they call it

I wish it werent sighed the girlwife

Virginia observed that she looked both sad and weary She had started
on her ride like a prisoner released from his dungeon happy in the
sunshine the swift motion the sting of the wind in her face There
had been a sparkle in her eye and a ring of gaiety in her laugh Into
her cheeks a faint color had glowed so that the contrast of their
clear pallor with the vivid scarlet of the little lips had been less
pronounced than usual But now she was listless and distraite the
girlish abandon all stricken out of her It needed no clairvoyant to
see that her heart was heavy and that she was longing for the moment
when she could be alone with her pain

Her friend had learned what she wanted to know and the knowledge of it
troubled her She would have given a good deal to have been able to
lift this sorrow from the girl riding beside her For she was aware
that Aline Harley might as well have reached for the moon as that
toward which her untutored heart yearned She had come to life late and
traveled in it but a little way Yet the tragedy of it was about to
engulf her No lifeboat was in sight She must sink or swim alone
Virginias unspoiled heart went out to her with a rush of pity and
sympathy Almost the very words that Waring Ridgway had used came to
her lips

You poor lamb You poor forsaken lamb

But she spoke instead with laughter and lightness seeing nothing of
the girls distress at least until after they separated at the door
of the hotel



CHAPTER 13 FIRST BLOOD

After Ridgways cavalier refusal to negotiate a peace treaty Simon
Harley and his bodyguard walked back to the offices of the
Consolidated where they arrived at the same time as the news of the
enemys first blow since the declaration of renewed war

Hobart was at his desk with his ear to the telephone receiver when the
great financier came into the inner office of the manager

Yes When Driven out you say Yesyes Anybody hurt Followed our
men through into our tunnel No dont do anything till you hear from
me Send Rhys up at once Let me know any further developments that
occur

Hobart hung up the receiver and turned on his swivelchair toward his
chief Another outrage sir at the hands of Ridgway It is in regard
to those veins in the Copper King that he claims Dalton his
superintendent of the Taurus drove a tunnel across our lateral lines
and began working them though their own judge has not yet rendered a
decision in their favor Of course I put a large force in them at
once Today we tapped their workings at the twelfth level Our
foreman Miles has just telephoned me that Dalton turned the air
pressure on our men blew out their candles and flung a mixture of
lime and rocks at them Several of the men are hurt though none badly
It seems that Dalton has thrown a force into our tunnels and is holding
the entrances against us at the point where the eleventh twelfth and
thirteenth levels touch the cage It means that he will work those
veins and probably others that are acknowledged to be ours unless we
drive them out which would probably be a difficult matter

Harley listened patiently eyes glittering and cleanshaven lips
pressed tightly against his teeth What do you propose to do

I havent decided yet If we could get any justice from the courts an
injunction

Cant be got from Purcell Dont waste time considering it Fight it
out yourself Find his weakest spot then strike hard and suddenly
Harleys low metallic voice was crisp and commanding

His weakest spot

Exactly Has he no mines upon which we can retaliate

There is the Taurus It lies against the Copper King end to end He
drove a tunnel into some of our workings last winter That would give a
passageway to send our men through if we decide to do so Then there
is his New York Its workings connect with those of the Jim Hill

Good Send as many men through as is necessary to capture and hold
both mines Get control of the entire workings of them both and begin
taking ore out at once Station armed guards at every point where it is
necessary and as many as are necessary Use ten thousand men if you
need that many But dont fail Well give Ridgway a dose of his own
medicine and teach him that for every pound of our ore he steals well
take ten

Hell get an injunction from the courts

Let him get forty Ill show him that his robber courts will not save
him Anyhow well cross that bridge when we come to it

Hobart almost swept from his moorings by the fiery energy of his
chief braced himself to withstand the current

I shall have to think about that We cant fight lawlessness with
lawlessness except for selfpreservation

Think You do nothing but think Mr Hobart You are here to act
came the scornful retort And what is this but selfpreservation

I am willing to recapture our workings in the Copper King Ill lead
the attack in person sir But as to a retaliatory attackthe facts
will not justify a capture of his property because he has seized ours

Wrong sir This is no time for halfway measures I have resolved to
crush this freebooter since he has purchased your venal courts then
by the only means left usforce

Hobart rose from his seat very pale and erect His eyes met those of
the great man unflinchingly You realize that this may mean murder
Mr Harley That a clash cannot possibly be avoided if you pursue this
course

I realize that it is selfpreservation came the cold retort There
is no law here none at least that gives us justice We are back to
savagery dragged back by the madness of this ruffian It is his
choice not mine Let him abide by it

Your intention to follow this course is irrevocable

Absolutely

In that case I must regretfully offer my resignation as manager of
the Consolidated

It is accepted Mr Hobart I cant have men working under me that are
not loyal body and soul to the hand that feeds them No man can serve
two masters Mr Hobart

That is why I resign Mr Harley You give me the devils work to do
I have done enough of it By Heaven I will be a free man hereafter
The disgust and dissatisfaction that had been pent within him for many
a month broke forth hot from the lips of this selfrepressed man It
is all wrong on both sides Two wrongs do not make a right The system
of espionage we employ over everybody both on his side and ours the
tyrannical use we make of our power the corruption we foster in
politics our secret bargains with railroads our evasions of law as to
taxes and in every other way that suits us it is all wrongall
wrong Ill be a party to it no longer You see to what it
leadsmurder and anarchy Ill be a poor man if I must but Ill be a
free and honest one at least

You are talking wickedly and wildly Mr Hobart You are criticizing
God when you criticize the business conditions he has put into the
world I did not know that you were a socialist but what you have just
said explains your course the old man reproved sadly and
sanctimonious

I am not a socialist Mr Harley but you and your methods have made
thousands upon thousands of them in this country during the past ten
years

We shall not discuss that Mr Hobart nor indeed is any discussion
necessary Frankly I am greatly disappointed in you I have for some
time been dissatisfied with your management but I did not of course
know you held these anarchistic views I want however to be perfectly
just You are a very good business man indeed careful and thorough
That you have not a bold enough grasp of mind for the place you hold is
due perhaps to these dangerous ideas that have unsettled you Your
salary will be continued for six months Is that satisfactory

No sir I could not be willing to accept it longer than today And
when you say bold enough why not be plain and say unscrupulous
enough amended the younger man

As you like I dont juggle with words The point is you dont
succeed This adventurer Ridgway scores continually against you He
has beaten you clear down the line from start to finish Is that not
true

Because he does not hesitate to stoop to anything because

Precisely You have given the very reason why he must be fought in the
same spirit Business ethics would be as futile against him as chivalry
in dealing with a jungletiger

You would then have had me stoop to any petty meanness to win no
matter how contemptible

The New Yorker waved him aside with a patient benignant gesture I
dont care for excuses I ask of my subordinates success You do not
get it for me I must find a man who can

Hobart bowed with fine dignity The touch of disdain in his slight
smile marked his sense of the difference between them He was again his
composed rigid self

Can you arrange to allow my resignation to take effect as soon as
possible I should prefer to have my connection with the company
severed before any action is taken against these mines

At oncetoday Your resignation may be published in the Herald this
afternoon and you will then be acquitted of whatever may follow

Thank you Hobart hesitated an instant before he said There is a
point that I have already mentioned to you which with your permission
I must again advert to The temper of the miners has been very bitter
since you refused to agree to Mr Ridgways proposal for an eighthour
day I would urge upon you to take greater precautions against a
personal attack You have many lawless men among your employees They
are foreigners for the most part unused to selfrestraint It is only
right you should know they execrate your name

The great man smiled blandly Popularity is nothing to me I have
neither sought it nor desired it Given a great work to do with the
Divine help I have done it irrespective of public clamor For many
years I have lived in the midst of alarms Mr Hobart I am not
foolhardy What precautions I can reasonably take I do For the rest
my confidence is in an allwise Providence It is written that not even
a sparrow falls without His decree In that promise I put my trust If
I am to be cut off it can only be by His will The Lord gave and the
Lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the Lord Such I pray
may be the humble and grateful spirit with which I submit myself to His
will

The retiring manager urged the point no further If you have decided
upon my successor and he is on the ground I shall be glad to give the
afternoon to running over with him the affairs of the office It would
be well for him to retain for a time my private secretary and
stenographer

Mr Mott will succeed you He will no doubt be glad to have your
assistance in helping him fall into the routine of the office Mr
Hobart

Harley sent for Mott at once and told him of his promotion The two men
were closeted together for hours while trusted messengers went and
came incessantly to and from the mines Hobart knew of course that
plans were in progress to arm such of the Consolidated men as could be
trusted and that arrangements were being made to rush the Taurus and
the New York Everything was being done as secretly as possible but
Hobarts experience of Ridgway made it obvious to him that this
excessive activity could not pass without notice His spies like those
of the trust swarmed everywhere

It was not till midafternoon of the next day that Mott found time to
join him and run over with him the details of such unfinished business
as the office had taken up The retiring manager was courtesy itself
nor did he feel any bitterness against his successor Nevertheless he
came to the end of office hours with great relief The day had been a
very hard one and it left him with a longing for solitude and the wide
silent spaces of the open hills He struck out in the direction which
promised him the quickest opportunity to leave the town behind him A
good walker he covered the miles rapidly and under the physical
satisfaction of the tramp the brain knots unraveled and smoothed
themselves out It was better sobetter to live his own life than the
one into which he was being ground by the inexorable facts of his
environment He was a young man and ambitious but his hopes were not
selfish At bottom he was an idealist though a practical one He had
had to shut his eyes to many things which he deplored had been driven
to compromises which he despised Essentially cleanhanded the soul of
him had begun to wither at the contact of that which he saw about him
and was so large a part of

I am not fit for it That is the truth Mott has no imagination and
property rights are the most sacred thing on earth to him He will do
better at it than I he told himself as he walked forward bareheaded
into the great sunset glow that filled the saddle between two purple
hills in front of him

As he swung round a bend in the road a voice clear and sweet came to
him through the light filtered air

Laska

A young woman on horseback was before him Her pony stood across the
road and she looked up a trail which ran down into it The lifted
poise of the head brought out its fine lines and the distinction with
which it was set upon the wellmolded throat column Apparently she was
calling to some companion on the trail who had not yet emerged into
view

At sound of his footsteps the riders head turned

Good afternoon Mr Hobart she said quietly as coolly as if her
heart had not suddenly begun to beat strangely fast

Good afternoon Miss Balfour

Each of them was acutely conscious of the barrier between them Since
the day when she had told him of her engagement they had not met even
casually and this their first sight of each other was not without
embarrassment

We have been to Lone Pine Cone she said rather hurriedly to bridge
an impending silence

He met this obvious statement with another as brilliant

I walked out from town My horse is a little lame

But there was something she wanted to say to him and the time for
saying it before the arrival of her companion was short She would
not waste it in commonplaces

I dont usually read the papers very closely but this morning I read
both the Herald and the Sun Did you get my note

Your note No

I sent it by mail I wanted you to know that your friends are proud of
you We know why you resigned It is easy to read between the lines

Thank you he said simply I knew you would know

Even the Sun recognizes that it was because you are too good a man for
the place

Praise from the Sun has rarely shone my way he said with a touch of
irony for that paper was controlled by the Ridgway interest In its
approval I am happy

Her impulsive sympathy for this man whom she so greatly liked would not
accept the rebuff imposed by this reticence She stripped the gauntlet
from her hand and offered it in congratulation

He took it in his a slight flush in his face

I have done nothing worthy of praise One cannot ask less of a man
than that he remain independent and honest I couldnt do that and stay
with the Consolidated or so it seemed to me So I resigned That is
all there is to it

It is enough I dont know another man would have done it would have
had the courage to do it after his feet were set so securely in the way
of success The trouble with Americans is that they want too much
success They want it at too big a price

Im not likely ever to have too much of it he laughed sardonically

Success in life and success in living arent the same thing It is
because you have discovered this that you have sacrificed the less for
the greater She smiled and added I didnt mean that to sound as
preachy as it does

Im afraid you make too much of a small thing My squeamishness has
probably made me the laughingstock of Mesa

If so that is to the discredit of Mesa she insisted stanchly But
I dont think so A great many people who couldnt have done it
themselves will think more of you for having done it

Another pony which had been slithering down the steep trail in the
midst of a small rock slide now brought its rider safely to a halt in
the road Virginia introduced them and Hobart remembered that he had
heard Miss Balfour speak of a young woman whom she had met on the way
out a Miss Laska Lowe who was coming to Mesa to teach domestic
science in the public schools There was something about the young
teachers looks that he liked though she was of a very different type
than Virginia Not at all pretty in any accepted sense she yet had a
charm born of the vital honesty in her She looked directly at one out
of sincere gray eyes wideawake and fearless As it happened her
friend had been telling her about Hobart and she was interested in him
from the first For she was of that minority which lives not by bread
alone and she felt a glow of pride in the man who could do what the
Sun had given this man credit for editorially

They talked at haphazard for a few minutes before the young women
cantered away As Hobart trudged homeward he knew that in the eyes of
these two women at least he had not been a fool



CHAPTER 14 A CONSPIRACY

Tucked away in an obscure corner of the same issue of the papers which
announced the resignation of Lyndon Hobart as manager of the
Consolidated properties and the appointment of James K Mott as his
temporary successor were little onestick paragraphs regarding
explosions which had occurred the night before in tunnels of the
Taurus and the New York The general public paid little attention to
these but those on the inside knew that Ridgway had scored again His
spies had carried the news to him of the projected capture of these two
properties by the enemy Instead of attempting to defend them by force
he had set off charges of giant powder which had brought down the tunnel
roofs and effectually blocked the entrances from the Consolidated mines
adjoining

With the indefatigable patience which characterized him Harley set
about having the passages cleared of the rock and timber with which
they were filled Before he had succeeded in doing this his enemy
struck another telling blow From Judge Purcell he secured an
injunction against the Consolidated from working its mines the Diamond
King the Mary K and the Marcus Daly on the absurd contention that
the principal orevein of the Marcus Daly apexed on the tin triangle
wedged in between these three great mines and called by Ridgway the
Trust Buster Though there was not room enough upon this fragment to
sink a shaft it was large enough to found this claim of a vein
widening as it descended until it crossed into the territory of each of
these properties Though Harley could ignore court injunctions which
erected only underground territory he was forced to respect this one
since it could not be violated except in the eyes of the whole country
The three mines closed down and several thousand workmen were thrown
out of employment These were immediately reemployed by Ridgway and set
to work both in his own and the Consolidateds territory

Within a week a dozen new suits were instituted against the
Consolidated by its enemy He harassed it by contempt proceedings by
applications for receiverships and by other ingenious devices which
greatly tormented the New York operator For the first time in his life
the courts which Harley had used to much advantage in his battles to
maintain and extend the trusts he controlled could not be used even to
get scant justice

Meanwhile both leaders were turning their attention to the political
situation The legislators were beginning to gather for the coming
session and already the city was full of rumors about corruption For
both the Consolidated and its enemy were making every effort to secure
enough votes to win the election of a friendly United States senator
The man chosen would have the distribution of the federal patronage of
the State This meant the control of the most influential local
politicians of the party in power at Washington as well as their
followers an almost vital factor for success in a State where
political corruption had so interwoven itself into the business life of
the community

The hotel lobbies were filled with politicians gathered from every
county in the State Big bronzed cattlemen brushed shoulders with
budding lawyers from country towns and ward bosses from the larger
cities The bars were working overtime and the steady movement of
figures in the corridors lasted all day and most of the night Here and
there were collected groups laughing and talking about the old
frontier days or commenting in lowered tones on some phase of the
feverish excitement that was already beginning to be apparent
Elevators shot up and down subtracting and adding to the kaleidoscope
of human life in the rotundas Bellboys hurried to and fro with
messages and cocktails The ring of the telephonebell cut occasionally
into the deep hum of many voices All was confusion keen interest
expectancy

For it was known that Simon Harley had sent for 300000 in cold cash
to secure the election of his candidate Roger D Warner a lawyer who
had all his life been close to corporate interests It was known too
that Waring Ridgway had gathered together every element in the State
that opposed the domination of the Consolidated to fight their man to
a finish Bets for large sums were offered and taken as to the result
heavy odds being given in favor of the big copper trusts candidate
For throughout the State at large the Consolidated influence was very
great indeed It owned forest lands and railroads and mines It
controlled local transportation largely Nearly onehalf the working
men in the State were in its employ Into every town and village the
ramifications of its political organization extended The feeling
against it was very bitter but this was usually expressed in whispers
For it was in a position to ruin almost any business man upon whom it
fastened a grudge and to make wealthy any upon whom it chose to cast
its favors

Nevertheless there were some not so sure that the Consolidated would
succeed in electing its man Since Ridgway had announced himself as a
candidate there had been signs of defection on the part of some of
those expected to vote for Warner He had skillfully wielded together
in opposition to the trust all the elements of the State that were
hostile to it and already the word was being passed that he had not
come to the campaign without a barrel of his own

The balloting for United States senator was not to begin until the
eighth day of the session but the opening week was full of a tense and
suppressed excitement It was known that agents of both sides were
moving to and fro among the representatives and State senators
offering fabulous prices for their votes and the votes of any others
they might be able to control Men who had come to the capital
confident in their strength and integrity now looked at their neighbors
furtively and guiltily Day by day the legislators were being debauched
to serve the interest of the factions which were fighting for control
of the State Night after night secret meetings were being held in
outoftheway places to seduce those who clung desperately to their
honesty or held out for a bigger price Bribery was in the air
rampant unashamed Thousanddollar bills were as common as tendollar
notes in ordinary times

Sam Yesler commenting on the situation to his friend Jack Roper a
fellow member of the legislature who had been a cattleman from the time
he had given up driving a stage thirty years before shook his head
dejectedly over his blue points

I tell you Jack a man has to be bedrocked in honesty or hes gone
Think of it A country lawyer comes here who has never seen five
thousand dollars in a lump sum and they shove fifteen thousand at him
for his vote He is poor ambitious struggling along from hand to
mouth I reckon we aint in a position to judge that poor devil of a
harassed fellow Mebbe hes always been on the square came here to do
what was right well say but he sees corruption all round him How
can he help getting a warped notion of things He sees his friends and
his neighbors falling by the wayside By God its got to the point in
this legislature that an honest mans an object of obloquy

Thats right agreed Roper Easy enough for us to be square We got
good ranches back of us and can spend the winter playing poker at the
Mesa Club if we feel like it But if we stood where Billy George and
Garner and Roberts and Munz do I aint so damn sure my virtue would
stand the strain Can you reach that salt Sam

Billy George has got a sick wife and hes been wanting to send her
back to her folks in the East but he couldnt afford it The doctors
figured she ought to stay a year and Billy would have to hire a woman
to take care of his kids I said to him Hell Billy whats a friend
for And I shoves a check at him He wouldnt look at it said he
didnt know whether he could ever pay it and he had not come down to
charity yet

Billys a white man Thats what makes me sick Right on top of all
his bad luck he comes here and sees that everybody is getting a big
roll He thinks of that whitefaced wife of his dragging herself round
among the kids and dying by inches for lack of what money can buy her
I tell you I dont blame him Its the fellows putting the temptation
up to him that ought to be strung up

I see that hound Peltons mighty active in it Hes got it in for
Ridgway since Waring threw him down and hes plugging night and day
for Warner Stays pretty well tanked up Hopper tells me hes been
making threats to kill Waring on sight

I heard that and told Waring He laughed and said he hoped he would
live till Pelton killed him I like Waring Hes got the guts as his
miners say But hes away off on this fight Hes using money right and
left just as Harley is

Yesler nodded The whole towns corrupted It takes bribery for
granted Men meet on the street and ask what the price of votes is this
morning Everybody feels prosperous

I heard that a chambermaid at the Quartzite Hotel found seven thousand
dollars in big bills pinned to the bottom of a mattress in Garners
room yesterday He didnt dare bank it of course

Poor devil Hes another man that would like to be honest but with
the whole place impregnated with bribery he couldnt stand the
pressure But after this is all over hell go home to his wife and his
neighbors with the canker of this thing at his heart until he dies I
tell you Jack Im for stopping it if we can

How

Theres one way Ive been approached indirectly by Pelton to deliver
our vote to the Consolidated Suppose we arrange to do it get
evidence and make a public exposure

They were alone in a private diningroom of a restaurant but Yeslers
voice had fallen almost to a whisper With his steady gray eyes he
looked across at the man who had ridden the range with him fifteen
years ago when he had not had a sou to bless himself with

Roper tugged at his long drooping mustache and gazed at his friend
Its a large order Sam a devilish large order Do you reckon we
could deliver

I think so There are six of us that will stand pat at any cost If we
play our cards right and keep mum the surprise of it is bound to shake
votes loose when we spring the bomb The whole point is whether we can
take advantage of that surprise to elect a decent man I dont say it
can be done but theres a chance of it

The old stagedriver laughed softly Well be damned good and plenty
by both sides

Of course It wont be a pleasant thing to do but then it isnt
exactly pleasant to sit quiet and let these factions use the State as a
pawn in their game of grab

Im with you Sam Go to it my boy and Ill back you to the limit

We had better not talk it over here Come to my room after dinner and
bring Landor and James with you Ill have Reedy and Keller there Ill
mention casually that its a big game of poker and Ill have cards and
drinks sent up You want to remember we cant be too careful If it
leaks out we lose

Im a clam Sam Do you want I should speak of it to Landor and James

Better wait till we get together

What about Ward Hes always been with us

He talks too much We can take him in at the last minute if we like

That would be better I aint so sure about Reedy either Hes
straight as a string of course not a crooked hair in his head But
when he gets to drinking hes likely to let things out

Youre right Well leave him out too until the last minute Theres
another thing Ive thought of Ridgway cant win At least I dont see
how he can control more than twenty five votes Suppose at the very
last moment we make a deal with him and with the Democrats to pool our
votes on some square man With Waring its anything to beat the
Consolidated Hell jump at the chance if hes sure he is out of the
running himself Those of the Democrats that Harley cant buy will be
glad to beat his man I dont say it can be done Jack All I say is
that it is worth a trial

You bet

They met that night in Yeslers rooms round a cardtable The hands
were dealt for forms sake since there were spies everywhere and it
was necessary to ring for cigars and refreshments occasionally to avoid
suspicion They were all cattlemen large or small big outdoors
sunburned men who rode the range in the spring and fall with their
punchers and asked no odds of any man

Until long past midnight they talked the details over and when they
separated in the small hours it was with a welldefined plan to save
the State from its impending disgrace if the thing could be done



CHAPTER 15 LASKA OPENS A DOOR

The first ballots for a United States senator taken by the legislature
in joint session failed to disclose the alignment of some of the
doubtful members The Democratic minority of twentyeight votes were
cast for Springer the senator whose place would be taken by whoever
should win in the contest now on Warner received fortyfour Ridgway
twentysix eight went to Pascom a former governor whom the cattlemen
were supporting and the remaining three were scattered Each day one
ballot was taken and for a week there was a slight sifting down of the
complimentary votes until at the end of it the count stood

 Warner 45
 Ridgway 28
 Springer 28
 Pascom 8

Warner still lacked ten votes of an election but It was pretty
thoroughly understood that several of the Democratic minority were
waiting only long enough for a colorable excuse to switch to him All
kinds of rumors were in the air as to how many of these there were The
Consolidated leaders boldly claimed that they had only to give the word
to force the election of their candidate on any ballot Yesler did not
believe this claim could be justified since Pelton and Harley were
already negotiating with him for the delivery of the votes belonging to
the cattlemens contingent

He had held off for some time with hints that it would take a lot of
money to swing the votes of such men as Roper and Landor but he had
finally come to an agreement that the eight votes should be given to
Warner for a consideration of 300000 This was to be paid to Yesler
in the presence of the other seven members on the night before the
election and was to be held in escrow by him and Roper until the pact
was fulfilled the money to be kept in a safety deposit vault with a
key in possession of each of the two

On the third day of the session before the voting had begun Stephen
Eaton who was a State senator from Mesa moved that a committee be
appointed to investigate the rumors of bribery that were so common The
motion caught the Consolidated leaders napping for this was the last
man they had expected to propose such a course and it went through
with little opposition as a similar motion did in the House at the
same time The lieutenantgovernor and the speaker of the House were
both opposed to Warner and the joint committee had on it the names of
no Consolidated men The idea of such a committee had originated with
Ridgway and had been merely a bluff to show that he at least was
willing that the world should know the whole story of the election Nor
had this committee held even formal meetings before word reached Eaton
through Yesler that if it would appoint a conference in some very
private place evidence would be submitted implicating agents of the
Warner forces in attempts at bribery

It was close to eleven oclock when Sam Yesler stepped quietly from a
side door of his hotel and slipped into the street He understood
perfectly that in following the course he did he was taking his life
in his hands The exposure of the bribery traffic would blast forever
the reputations of many men who had hitherto held a high place in the
community and he knew the temper of some of them well enough to be
aware that an explosion was probable Spies had been dogging him ever
since the legislature convened Within an hour one of them would be
flying to Pelton with the news that he was at a meeting of the
committee and all the thugs of the other side would be turned loose on
his heels As he walked briskly through the streets toward the place
appointed his hand lay on the hilt of a revolver in the outside pocket
of his overcoat He was a man who would neither seek trouble nor let it
overwhelm him If his life were attempted he meant to defend it to the
last

He followed side streets purposely and his footsteps echoed along the
deserted road He knew he was being dogged for once when he glanced
back he caught sight of a skulking figure edging along close to a
wall The sight of the spy stirred his blood Grimly he laughed to
himself They might murder him for what he was doing but not in time
to save the exposure which would be brought to light on the morrow

The committee met at a roadhouse near the outskirts of the city but
only long enough to hear Yeslers facts and to appoint another meeting
for three hours later at the offices of Eaton For the committee had
come here for secrecy and they knew that it would be only a short time
before Peltons heelers would be down upon them in force It was agreed
they should divide and slip quietly back to town wait until everything
was quiet and convene again Meanwhile Eaton would make arrangements to
see that his offices would be sufficiently guarded for protection
against any attack

Yesler walked back to town and was within a couple of blocks of his
hotel when he glimpsed two figures crouching against the fence of the
alley He stopped in his tracks watched them intently an instant and
was startled by a whistle from the rear He knew at once his retreat
too was cut off and without hesitation vaulted the fence in front of
a big gray stone house he was passing A revolver flashed from the
alley and he laughed with a strange kind of delight His thought was
to escape round the house but trellis work barred the way and he
could not open the gate

Trapped by Jove he told himself coolly as a bullet struck the
trellis close to his head

He turned back ran up the steps of the porch and found momentary
safety in the darkness of its heavy vines But this he knew could not
last Running figures were converging toward him at a focal point He
could hear oaths and cries Some one was throwing aimless shots from a
revolver at the porch

He heard a window go up in the second story and a womans frightened
voice ask What is it Who is there

Let me in Im ambushed by thugs he called back

There he isin the doorway a voice cried out of the night and it
was followed by a spatter of bullets about him

He fired at a man leaping the fence The fellow tumbled back with a
kind of scream

God Im hit

He could hear steps coming down the stairway and fingers fumbling at
the key of the door His attackers were gathering for a rush and he
wondered whether the rescue was to be too late They came together the
opening door and the forward pour of huddled figures He stepped back
into the hall

There was a raucous curse a shot and Yesler had slammed the door
shut He was alone in the darkness with his rescuer

We must get out of here Theyre firing through the door he said
and Yes came faintly back to him from across the hall

Do you know where the switch is he asked wondering whether she was
going to be such an idiot as to faint at this inopportune moment

His answer came in a flood of light and showed him a young woman
crouched on the hallrack a dozen feet from the switch She was very
white and there was a little stain of crimson on the white lace of her
sleeve

A voice from the landing above demanded quickly Who are you sir
and after he had looked up cried in surprise Mr Yesler

Miss Balfour he replied Ill explain later Im afraid the lady
has been hit by a bullet

He was already beside his rescuer She looked at him with a trace of a
tired smile and said

In my arm

After which she fainted He picked up the young woman carried her to
the stairs and mounted them

This way said Virginia leading him into a bedroom the door of
which was open

He observed with surprise that she too was dressed in evening
clothes and rightly surmised that they had just come back from some
social function

Is it serious asked Virginia when he had laid his burden on the bed

She was already clipping with a pair of scissors the sleeve from round
the wound

It ought not to be he said after he had examined it The bullet has
scorched along the fleshy part of the forearm We must telephone for a
doctor at once

She did so then found water and cotton for bandages and helped him
make a temporary dressing The patient recovered consciousness under
the touch of the cold water and asked what was the matter

You have been hurt a little but not badly I think Dont you
remember You came down and opened the door to let me in

They were shooting at you What for she wanted to know

He smiled Dont worry about that Its all over with Im sorry you
were hurt in saving me said Yesler gently

Did I save you The gray eyes showed a gleam of pleasure

You certainly did

This is Mr Yesler Laska Mr YeslerMiss Lowe I think you have
never met

Never before tonight he said pinning the bandage in place round
the plump arm There Thats all just now maam Did I hurt you very
much

The young woman felt oddly exhilarated Not much Ill forgive you if
youll tell me all about the affair Why did they want to hurt you

His big heart felt very tender toward this girl who had been wounded
for him but he showed it only by a smiling deference

Youre right persistent maam You hadnt ought to be bothering your
head about any such thing but if you feel that way Ill be glad to
tell you

He did While they sat there and waited for the coming of the doctor
he told her the whole story of his attempt to stop the corruption that
was eating like a canker at the life of the State He was a plain man
not in the least eloquent and he told his story without any sense that
he had played any unusual part In fact he was ashamed that he had
been forced to assume a role which necessitated a kind of treachery to
those who thought they had bought him

Laska Lowes eyes shone with the delight his tale inspired in her She
lived largely in the land of ideals and this fight against wrong moved
her mightily She could feel for him none of the shame which he felt
for himself at being mixed up in so bad a business He was playing a
mans part had chosen it at risk of his life That was enough In
every fiber of her she was glad that good fortune had given her the
chance to bear a part of the battle In her inmost heart she was even
glad that to the day of her death she must bear the scar that would
remind her she had suffered in so good a cause

Virginia for once obliterating herself perceived how greatly taken
they were with each other At bottom nearly every woman is a
matchmaker This one was no exception She liked both this man and
this woman and her fancy had already begun to follow her hopes Never
before had Laska appeared to show much interest in any of the opposite
sex with whom her friend had seen her Now she was all enthusiasm had
forgotten completely the pain of her wound in the spirits glow

 She loved me for the danger I had passd
 And I loved her that she did pity them
 This only is the witchcraft I have usd

Virginia quoted softly to herself her eyes on the young woman so
finely unconscious of the emotion that thrilled her

Not until the clock in the hall below struck two did Yesler remember
his appointment in the Ridgway Building The doctor had come and was
about to go He suggested that if Yesler felt it would be safe for him
to go they might walk across to the hotel together

And leave us alone Laska could have bitten her tongue after the
words were out

Virginia explained The Leighs are out of the city tonight and it
happens that even the servants are gone I asked Miss Lowe to stay with
me all night but of course she feels feverish and nervous after this
excitement Couldnt you send a man to watch the rest of the night out
in the house

Why dont you stay Mr Yesler the doctor suggested You could
sleep here no doubt

You might have your meeting here It is neutral ground I can phone to
Mr Ridgway proposed Virginia in a low voice to Yesler

Doesnt that seem to imply that Im afraid to leave laughed Yesler

It implies that we are afraid to have you Laska would worry both on
your account and our own I think you owe it to her to stay

Oh if thats the way it strikes you he agreed Fact is I dont
quite like to leave you anyhow Well take Leighs study I dont think
we shall disturb you at all

Im sure you wontand before you go youll let us know what you
have decided to do

We shall not be through before morning Youll be asleep by then he
made answer

No I couldnt sleep till I know all about it

Nor I agreed Laska I want to know all about everything

My dear young lady you are to take the sleepingpowders and get a
good rest the doctor demurred All about everything is too large an
order for your good just now

Virginia nodded in a businesslike way Yes youre to go to sleep
Laska and when you waken Ill tell you all about it

That would be better smiled Yesler and Virginia thought it
significant that her friend made no further protest

Gray streaks began to show in the sky before Yesler tapped on the door
of Virginias room She had discarded the rather elaborate evening gown
he had last seen her in and was wearing some soft fabric which hung
from the shoulders in straight lines and defined the figure while
lending the effect of a loose and flowing drapery

How is your patient he asked

She has dropped into a good sleep the girl whispered I am sure we
dont need to worry about her at all

Nevertheless its a luxury Im going to permit myself for a day or
two he smiled I dont have my life saved by a young lady very
often

Im sure you will enjoy worrying about her she laughed

He got back at her promptly Theres somebody downstairs worrying
about you He wants to know if there is anything he can do for you and
suggests inviting himself for breakfast in order to make sure

Mr Ridgway

How did you guess it first crack Mr Ridgway it is

She considered a moment Yes tell him to stay Molly will be back in
time to make breakfast and I want to talk to him Now tell me what you
did

We did Mr Warner At least I hope so he chuckled

Im so glad And who is to be senator Is it Waring

No It wouldnt have been possible to elect him even if we had wanted
to

And you didnt want to she flashed

No we didnt he admitted frankly We couldnt afford to have it
generally understood that this was merely a partisan fight on the
Consolidated and that we were pulling Warings chestnuts out of the
fire for him

He did not add though he might have that Ridgway was tarred with the
same brush as the enemy in this matter

Then who is it to be

Thats a secret I cant tell even you that But we have agreed on a
man Waring is to withdraw and throw his influence for him The
Democratic minority will swing in line for him and well do the rest
Thats the plan It may not go through however

I dont see who it can be that you all unite on Of course it isnt
Mr Pelton

I should hope not

Or Mr Samuel Yesler

Youve used up all the guesses allowed you If you want to know why
dont you attend the joint session today It ought to be highly
interesting

I shall she announced promptly And Ill bring Laska with me

She wont be able to come

I think she will Its only a scratch

I dont like to think how much worse it might have been

Then dont think of it Tell Waring Ill be down presently

He went downstairs again and Miss Balfour returned to the room

Was that Mr Yesler quietly asked a voice from the bed

Yes dear He has gone back to the hotel He asked about you of
course

He is very kind

It was thoughtful since you only saved his life admitted the
ironical Miss Balfour

Wasnt it fortunate that we were up

Very fortunate for him that you were

Virginia crossed the room to the bed and kissed her friend with some
subtle significance too elusive for words Laska appeared however to
appreciate it At least she blushed



CHAPTER 16 AN EXPLOSION IN THE TAURUS

The change of the relationship between Ridgway and his betrothed
brought about by the advent of a third person into his life showed
itself in the manner of their greeting She had always been chary of
lovers demonstrations but until his return from Alpine he had been
wont to exact his privilege in spite of her reluctance Now he was
content with the hand she offered him

Youve had a strenuous night of it he said after a glance at the
rather wan face she offered the new day

Yes we haveand for that matter I suppose you have too

Man of iron that he was he looked fresh as morning dew With his usual
lack of selfconsciousness he had appropriated Leighs private bath
and was glowing from contact with icecold water and a crash towel

Weve been making history he agreed Hows your friend

She has no fever at all It was only a scratch She will be down to
breakfast in a minute

Good She must be a thoroughbred to come running down into the bullets
for a stranger she has never seen

She is Youll like Laska

Im glad she saved Sam from being made a colander I cant help liking
him though he doesnt approve of me very much

I suppose not

He is friendly too Ridgway laughed as he recalled their battle over
who should be the nominee But his conscience rules him Its a free
and liberal conscience generally speakingnothing Puritan about it
but a distinctive product of the West Yet he would not have me for
senator at any price

Why

Didnt think I was fit to represent the people said if I went in it
would be to use the office for my personal profit

Wasnt he right

More or less If I were elected I would build up my machine of
course but I would see the people got a show too

She nodded agreement I dont think you would make a bad senator

I would be a live wire anyhow Sam had other objections to me He
thought I had been using too much money in this campaign

And have you she asked curious to see how he would defend himself

Yes I had to if I were going to stand any chance It wasnt from
choice I didnt really want to be senator I cant afford to give the
time to it but I couldnt afford to let Harley name the man either I
was between the devil and the deep sea

Then really Mr Yesler came to your rescue

Thats about it though he didnt intend it that way

And who is to be the senator

He gave her a cynical smile Warner

But I thoughtwhy surely he The surprise of his cool announcement
took her breath away

No he isnt the man our combination decided on but the trouble is
that our combination is going to fall through Sams an optimist but
youll see Im right There are too many conflicting elements of us in
one boat We cant lose three votes and win and its a safe bet we
lose them The Consolidated must know by this time what we have been
about all night Theyre busy now sapping at our weak links Our only
chance is to win on the first vote and I am very sure we wont be able
to do it

Oh I hope you are not right A young woman was standing in the
doorway her arm in a sling She had come in time to hear his prophesy
and in the disappointment of it had forgotten that he was a stranger

Virginia remedied this and they went in to breakfast Laska was full
of interest and poured out eager questions at Ridgway It was not for
several minutes that Virginia recollected to ask again who was the man
they had decided upon

Her betrothed found some inner source of pleasure that brought out a
sardonic smile Hes a slap in the face at both Harley and me

I cant think whois he honest

As the day

And capable

Oh yes Hes competent enough

Presentable

Yes Hell do the State credit or rather he would if he were going to
be elected

Then I give it up

He was leaning forward to tell when the sharp buzz of the electric
doorbell continued and sustained diverted the attention of all of
them

Ridgway put down his napkin Probably some one to see me

He had risen to his feet when the maid opened the door of the
diningroom

A gentleman to see Mr Ridgway He says it is very important

From the diningroom they could hear the murmur of quick voices and
soon Ridgway returned He was a transformed man His eyes were hard as
diamonds and there was the bulldog look of the fighter about his mouth
and chin

What is it Waring cried Virginia

Trouble in the mines An hour ago Harleys men rushed the Taurus and
the New York and drove my men out One of my shiftforemen and two of
his drillers were killed by an explosion set off by Mike Donleavy a
foreman in the Copper King

Did they mean to kill them asked the girl whitely

I suppose not But they took the chance Its murder just the sameby
Jove its a club with which to beat the legislators into line

He stopped his brain busy solving the problem as to how he might best
turn this development to his own advantage Part of his equipment was
his ability to decide swiftly and surely issues as they came to him
Now he strode to the telephone and began massing his forces

Main 234YesYesThis the SunGive me BraytonHello Brayton
Get out a special edition at once charging Harley with murder Run the
word as a red headline clear across the page Show that Vance Edwards
and the other boys were killed while on duty by an attack ordered by
Harley Point out that this is the logical result of his course Dont
mince words Give it him right from the shoulder Rush it and be sure
a copy of the paper is on the desk of every legislator before the
session opens this morning Have a reliable man there to see that every
man gets one Scatter the paper broadcast among the miners too This
is important

He hung up the receiver took it down again and called up Eaton

Hello This you Steve Send for Trelawney and Straus right away Get
them to call a mass meeting of the unions for ten oclock at the
courthouse square Have dodgers printed and distributed announcing it
Shut down all our mines so that the men can come I want Straus and
Trelawney and two or three of the other prominent labor leaders to
denounce Harley and lay the responsibility for this thing right at his
door Ill be up there and outline what they had better say

He turned briskly round to the young women his eyes shining with a
hard bright light Im sorry but I have got to cut out breakfast this
morning Business is piling up on me too fast If youll excuse me
Ill go now

What are you going to do asked Virginia

I havent time to tell you now Just watch my smoke he laughed
without mirth

No sooner did the news of the tragedy reach Simon Harley than he knew
the mistake of his subordinates would be a costly one The foreman
Donleavy who had directed the attack on the Taurus had to be brought
from the shafthouse under the protection of a score of Pinkerton
detectives to safeguard him from the swift vengeance of the miners who
needed but a word to fling themselves against the cordon of police
Harley himself kept his apartments the hotel being heavily patrolled
by guards on the lookout for suspicious characters The current of
public opinion never in his favor now ran swiftly against him and
threats were made openly by the infuriated miners to kill him on sight

The members of the unions came to the massmeeting reading the story of
the tragedy as the Sun colored the affair They stayed sullenly to
listen to redhot speeches against the leader of the trust and
gradually the wrath which was simmering in them began to boil Ridgway
always with a keen sense of the psychological moment descended the
courthouse steps just as this fury was at its height There were
instant cries for a speech from him so persistent that he yielded
though apparently with reluctance His fine presence and strong deep
voice soon gave him the ears of all that dense throng He was far out
of the ordinary as a public speaker and within a few minutes he had
his audience with him He deprecated any violence spoke strongly for
letting the law take its course and dropped a suggestion that they
send a committee to the Statehouse to urge that Harleys candidate be
defeated for the senatorship

Like wildfire this hint spread Here was something tangible they could
do that was still within the law Harley had set his mind on electing
Warner They would go up there in a body and defeat his plans Marshals
and leaders of companies were appointed They fell into ranks by fours
nearly ten thousand of them all told The big clock in the courthouse
was striking twelve when they began their march to the Statehouse



CHAPTER 17 THE ELECTION

At the very moment that the tramp of twenty thousand feet turned toward
the Statehouse the report of the bribery investigating committee was
being read to the legislature met in joint session The committee
reported that it had examined seven witnesses Yesler Roper Landor
James Reedy Kellor and Ward and that each of then had testified
that former Congressman Pelton or others had approached him on behalf
of Warner that an agreement had been made by which the eight votes
being cast for Bascom would be give to Warner in consideration of
300000 in cash to be held in escrow by Yesler and that the
committee now had the said package supposed to contain the bills for
that amount in its possession and was prepared to turn it over to the
legislature for examination

Except for the clerks voice as he read the report a dead silence lay
tensely over the crowded hall Men dared not look at their neighbors
scarce dared breathe for the terror that hung heavy on their hearts
Scores were there who expected their guilt to be blazoned forth for all
the world to read They waited whitely as the monotonous voice of the
clerk went from paragraph to paragraph and when at last he sat down
having named only the bribers and not the receivers of bribes a long
deep sigh of relief swept the house Fear still racked them but for
the moment they were safe Furtively their glances began to go from one
to another of their neighbors and ask for how long safety would endure

One could have heard the rustle of a leaf as the chairman of the
committee stepped forward and laid on the desk of the presiding officer
the incriminating parcel It seemed an age while the chief clerk opened
it counted the bills and announced that one hundred thousand dollars
was the sum contained within

Stephen Eaton then rose in his seat and presented quietly his
resolution that since the evidence submitted was sufficient to convict
of bribery the judge of the district court of the County of Mesa be
requested to call a special session of the grand jury to investigate
the report It was not until Sam Yesler rose to speak upon that report
that the pentup storm broke loose

He stood there in the careless garb of the cattleman a strong
cleancut figure as one would see in a days ride facing with
unflinching steelblue eyes the tempest of human passion he had evoked
The babel of voices rose and fell and rose again before he could find a
chance to make himself heard In the gallery two quietly dressed young
women one of them with her arm in a sling leaned forward breathlessly
and waited Laskas eyes glowed with deep fire She was living her hour
of hours and the man who stood with such quiet courage the focus of
that roar of rage was the hero of it

You call me Judas and I ask you what Christ I have betrayed You call
me traitor but traitor to what Like you I am under oath to receive
no compensation for my services here other than that allowed by law To
that oath I have been true Have you

For many weeks we have been living in a carnival of bribery in a
debauched hysteria of moneymadness The souls of men have been sifted
as by fire We have all been part and parcel of a manhunt an eager
furious persistent hunt that has relaxed neither night nor day The
lure of gold has been before us every waking hour and has pursued us
into our dreams The temptation has been everpresent To some it has
been irresistible to some maddening to others thank God it has but
proved their strength Our hopes our fears our loves our hates
these seducers of honor have pandered to them all Our debts and our
business our families and our friendships have all been used to hound
us Today I put the stigma for this shame where it belongsupon Simon
Harley head of the Consolidated and a score of other trusts and upon
Waring Ridgway head of the Mesa Oreproducing Company These are the
debauchers of our commonwealths fair name and you alas the
traffickers who hope to live upon its virtue I call upon you today to
pass this resolution and to elect a man to the United States senate who
shall owe no allegiance to any power except the people or to receive
forever the brand of public condemnation Are you free men Or do you
wear the collar of the Consolidated the yoke of Waring Ridgway The
vote which you will cast today is an answer that shall go flying to
the farthest corner of your world an answer you can never hope to
change so long as you live

He sat down in a dead silence Again men drew counsel from their fears
The resolution passed unanimously for none dared vote against it lest
he brand himself as bought and sold

It was in this moment while the hearts of the guilty were like water
that there came from the lawn outside the roar of a multitude of
voices Swiftly the word passed that ten thousand miners had come to see
that Warner was not elected That they were in a dangerous frame of
mind all knew It was a passionate undisciplined mob and to thwart
them would have been to invite a riot

Under these circumstances the joint assembly proceeded to ballot for a
senator The first name called was that of Adams He was an old
cattleman and a Democrat

Before voting I want to resign my plate a few moments to Mr Landor
of Kit Carson County he said

Landor was recognized a big broadshouldered plainsman with a leathery
face as honest as the sun He was known and liked by everybody even by
those opposed to him

Im going to make a speech he announced with the broad smile that
showed a flash of white teeth I reckon itll be the first I ever made
here and I promise it will be the last boys But I wont keep you
long either You all know how things have been going how men have
been moving in and out and buying men here like as if they were cattle
on the hoof Youve seen it and Ive seen it But we didnt have the
nerve to say it should stop One man did Hes the biggest man in this
big State today and it aint been five minutes since I heard you
hollar your lungs out cursing him You know who I meanSam Yesler

He waited till the renewed storm of cheers and hisses had died away

It dont do him any harm for you to hollar at him boysnot a mite I
want to say to you that hes a man He saw our old friends falling by
the wayside and some of you poor weaklings selling yourselves for
dollars Because he is an honest game man he set out to straighten
things up I want to tell you that my hats off to Sam Yesler

But that aint what I rose for Im going to name for the United
States senate a clean man one who doesnt wear either the Harley or
the Ridgway brand Hes as straight as a string not a crooked hair in
his head and every manjack of you knows it Im going to name a
manhe stopped an instant to smile genially around upon the circle of
uplifted faceswho isnt any friend of either one faction or another
a man who has just had independence enough to quit a big job because it
wasnt on the square That mans name is Lyndon Hobart If you want to
do yourselves proud gentlemen youll certainly elect him

If it was a sensation he had wanted to create he had it The Warner
forces were taken with dumb surprise But many of them were already
swiftly thinking it would be the best way out of a bad business He
would be conservative as fair to the Consolidated as to the enemy
More just now his election would appeal to the angry mob howling
outside the building for they could ask nothing more than the election
of the man who had resigned rather than order the attack on the Taurus
which had resulted in the death of some of their number

Hoyle of the Democrats seconded the nomination as also did Eaton in
a speech wherein he defended the course of Ridgway and withdrew his
name

Within a few minutes of the time that Eaton sat down the roll had been
called and Hobart elected by a vote of seventythree to twentyfour
the others refusing to cast a ballot

The two young women sitting together in the front row of the gallery
were glowing with triumphant happiness Virginia was still clapping her
hands when a voice behind her suggested that the circumstances did not
warrant her being so happy over the result She turned to see Waring
Ridgway smiling down at her

But I cant help being pleased Wasnt Mr Yesler magnificent

Sam was all right though he might have eased up a bit when he pitched
into me

He had to do that to be fair Everybody knows you and he are friends
I think it was fine of him not to let that make any difference in his
telling the truth

Oh I knew it would please you her betrothed laughed What do you
say to going out to lunch with me Ill get Sam too if I can

The young women consulted eyes and agreed very readily Both of them
enjoyed being so near to the heart of things

If Mr Yesler will lunch with the debaucher of the commonwealth we
shall be very happy to join the party said Virginia demurely

Ridgway led them down to the floor of the House Through the dense
throng they made their way slowly toward him Ridgway clearing a path
with his broad shoulders

Suddenly they heard him call sharply Look out Sam

The explosion of a revolver followed sharply his words Ridgway dived
through the press tossing men to right and left of him as a steamyacht
does the waves Through the open lane he left in his wake the young
women caught the meaning of the turmoil the crumpled figure was Yesler
swaying into the arms of his friend Roper the furious drinkflushed
face of Pelton and the menace of the weapon poised for a second shot
the swift impact of Warings body and the blow which sent the next
bullet crashing into the chandelier overhead All this they glimpsed
momentarily before the press closed in on the tragic scene and cut off
their view



CHAPTER 18 FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS

While Harley had been in no way responsible for Peltons murderous
attack upon Yesler public opinion held him to account The Pinkertons
who had up till this time been employed at the mines were now moved
to the hotel to be ready for an emergency A special train was held in
readiness to take the New Yorker out of the State in the event that the
stockman should die Meanwhile the harassing attacks of Ridgway
continued Through another judge than Purcell the absurd injunction
against working the Diamond King the Mary K and the Marcus Daly had
been dissolved but even this advantage had been neutralized by the
necessity of giving back to the enemy the Taurus and the New York of
which he had just possessed himself All his life he had kept a
wheathereye upon the impulsive and fickle public There were times
when its feeling could be abused with impunity and other times when
this must be respected Reluctantly Harley gave the word for the
withdrawal of his men from the territory gained Ridgway pushed his
advantage home and secured an injunction not only against the working
but against the inspection of the Copper King and the Jim Hill The
result of the Consolidated move had been in effect to turn over
temporarily its two rich mines to be looted by the pirate and to make
him very much stronger than before with his allies the unions By his
own imprudence Harley had made a bad situation worse and delivered
himself with his hands tied into the power of the enemy

In the days of turmoil that followed Waring Ridgways telling blows
scored once and again The morning after the explosion he started a
relief fund in his paper the Sun for the families of the dead miners
contributing two thousand dollars himself He also insisted that the
Consolidated pay damages to the bereaved families to the extent of
twenty thousand dollars for each man killed The town rang with his
praises Mesa had always been proud of his success had liked the
democratic spirit of him that led him to mix on apparently equal terms
with his working men and had backed him in his opposition to the trust
because his plucky and unscrupulous fight had been in a measure its
fight But now it idolized him He was the buffer between it and the
trust fighting the battles of labor against the great octopus of
Broadway and beating it to a standstill He was the Moses destined to
lead the working man out of the Egypt of his discontent Had he not
maintained the standard of wages and forced the Consolidated to do the
same Had he not declared an eighthour day and was not the trust
almost ready to do this also forced by the impetus his example had
given the unions So Ridgways agents whispered and the union leaders
whom he had bought took up the burden of their tale and preached it
both in private talk and in their speeches

In an attempt to stem the rising tide of denunciation that was
spreading from Mesa to the country at large Harley announced an eight
hour day and an immense banquet to all the Consolidated employees in
celebration of the occasion Ten thousand men sat down to the long
tables but when one of the speakers injudiciously mentioned the name
of Ridgway there was steady cheering for ten minutes It was quite
plain that the miners gave him the credit for having forced the
Consolidated to the eighthour day

The verdict of the coroners jury was that Vance Edwards and the other
deceased miners had come to their death at the hands of the foreman
Michael Donleavy at the instigation of Simon Harley True bills were
at once drawn up by the prosecuting attorney of Mesa County an
official elected by Ridgway charging Harley and Donleavy with
conspiracy resulting in the murder of Vance Edwards The billionaire
furnished bail for himself and foreman treating the indictments merely
as part of the attacks of the enemy

The tragedy in the Taurus brought to the surface a bitterness that had
hitherto not been apparent in the contest between the rival copper
interests The lines of division became more sharply drawn and every
business man in Mesa was forced to declare himself on one side or the
other Harley scattered detectives broadcast and imported five hundred
Pinkertons to meet any emergency that might arise The spies of the
Consolidated were everywhere gathering evidence against the Mesa
Oreproducing Company its conduct of the senatorial campaign its
judges and its supporters Criminal indictments flew back and forth
thick as snowflakes in a Christmas storm

It began to be noticed that an occasional foreman superintendent or
mining engineer was slipping from the employ of Ridgway to that of the
trust carrying secrets and evidence that would be invaluable later in
the courts Everywhere the money of the Consolidated scattered
lavishly where it would do the most good attempted to sap the loyalty
of the followers of the other candidates Even Eaton was approached
with the offer of a bribe

But Ridgways potent personality had built up an esprit de corps not
easily to be broken The adventurers gathered to his side were for the
most part bound to him by ties personal in their nature They were
financial fillibusters pledged to stand or fall together with an
interest in their predatory leaders success that was not entirely
measurable in dollars and cents Nor was that leader the man to allow
the organization he had builded with such care to become disintegrated
while he slept His alert eye and cheery smile were everywhere
instilling confidence in such as faltered and dread in those
contemplating defection

He harassed his rival with an audacity that was almost devilish in its
unexpected ingenuity For the first time in his life Simon Harley the
town back on the defensive by a combination of circumstances engineered
by a master brain knew what it was to be checkmated He had not the
least doubt of ultimate victory but the tentative success of the
brazen young adventurer were gall and wormwood to his soul He had
made money his god had always believed it would buy anything worth
while except life but this Western buccaneer had taught him it could
not purchase the love of a woman nor the immediate defeat of a man so
well armed as Waring Ridgway In truth though Harley stuck at nothing
his success in accomplishing the destruction of this thorn in his side
was no more appreciable than had been that of Hobart The Westerner
held his own and more the while he robbed the great trust of its ore
under cover of the courts

In the flush of success Ridgway through his lieutenant Eaton came
to Judge Purcell asking that a receiver be appointed for the
Consolidated Supply Company a subsidiary branch of the trust on the
ground that its affairs were not being properly administered The
Supply Company had paid dividends ranging from fifteen to twentyfive
per cent for many years but Ridgway exercised his right as a
stockholder to ask for a receivership In point of fact he owned in
the name of Eaton only onetenth of one per cent of the stock but it
was enough to serve For Purcell was a bigoted old Missourian as
courageous and obstinate as perfect health and ignorance could make
him He was quite innocent of any legal knowledge his own rule of law
being to hit a Consolidated head whenever he saw one Lawyers might
argue themselves black in the face without affecting his serenity or
his justice

Purcell granted the application as well as a restraining order against
the payment of dividends until further notice and appointed Eaton
receiver over the protests of the Consolidated lawyers

Ridgway and Eaton left the courtroom together jubilant over their
success They dined at a restaurant and spent the evening at the
oreproducing companys offices discussing ways and means When they
had finished his chief followed Eaton to the doors an arm thrown
affectionately round his shoulder

Steve were going to make a big killing I was never so sure of
anything in my life as that we shall beat Simon Harley at his own game
Were bound to win Weve got to win

I wish I were as sure as you

Its hard pounding does it my boy Well drive him out of the Montana
copperfields yet Well show him there is one little corner of the U
S where Simon Harleys orders dont go as the last word

He has a hundred dollars to your one

And I have youth and mining experience and the inside track as well
as stancher friends than he ever dreamed of laughed Ridgway clapping
the other on the back Well good night Steve Pleasant dreams old
man

The boyish secretary shook hands warmly Youre a MAN chief If
anybody can pull us through it will be you

Triumphant confidence rang in the others answering laugh You bet I
can Steve



CHAPTER 19 ONE MILLION DOLLARS

Eaton standing on the street curb at the corner of the Ridgway
Building lit a cigar while he hesitated between his rooms and the
club He decided for the latter and was just turning up the hill when
a hand covered his mouth and an arm was flung around his neck in a
stranglehold He felt himself lifted like a child and presently
discovered that he was being whirled along the street in a closed
carriage

You neednt be alarmed Mr Eaton Were not going to injure you in
the least a low voice explained in his ear If youll give me your
word not to cry out Ill release your throat

Eaton nodded a promise and when he could find his voice demanded
Where are you taking me

Youll see in a minute sir Its all right

The carriage turned into an alley and stopped Eaton was led to a
ladder that hung suspended from the fireescape and was bidden to
mount He did so following his guide to the second story and being in
turn followed by the other man He was taken along a corridor and into
the first of a suite of rooms opening into it He knew he was in the
Mesa House and suspected at once that he was in the apartments of
Simon Harley

His suspicion ripened to conviction when his captors led him through
two more rooms into one fitted as an office The billionaire sat at a
desk busy over some legal papers he was reading but he rose at once
and came forward with hand extended to meet Eaton The young man took
his hand mechanically

Glad to have the pleasure of talking with you Mr Eaton You must
accept my apologies for my methods of securing a meeting They are
rather primitive but since you declined to call and see me I can hold
only you to blame An acid smile touched his lips for a moment though
his eyes were expressionless as a wall Mr Eaton I have brought you
here in this way to have a confidential talk with you in order that it
might not in any way reflect upon you in case we do not come to an
arrangement satisfactory to both of us Your friends cannot justly
blame you for this conference since you could not avoid it Mr Eaton
take a chair

The wills of the two men flashed into each others eyes like rapiers
The weaker man knew what was before him and braced himself to meet it
He would not sit down He would not discuss anything So he told
himself once and again to hold himself steady against the impulse to
give way to those imperious eyes behind which was the impassive
compelling will

Sit down Mr Eaton

Ill stand Mr Harley

SIT DOWN

The cold jade eyes were not to be denied Eatons gaze fell sullenly
and he slid into a chair

Ill discuss no business except in the presence of Mr Ridgway he
said doggedly falling back to his second line of defenses

To the contrary my business is with you and not with Mr Ridgway

I know of no business you can have with me

Wherefore I have brought you here to acquaint you with it

The young man lifted his head reluctantly and waited If he had been
willing to confess it to himself he feared greatly this ruthless
spoiler who had built up the greatest fortune in the world from
thousands of wrecked lives He felt himself choking just as if those
skeleton fingers had been at his throat but he promised himself never
to yield

The fathomless dominant gaze caught and held his eyes Mr Eaton I
came here to crush Ridgway I am going to stay here till I do Im
going to wipe him from the map of Montanaruin him so utterly that he
can never recover It has been my painful duty to do this with a
hundred men as strong and as confident as he is After undertaking such
an enterprise I have never faltered and never relented The men I have
ruined were ruined beyond hope of recovery None of them have ever
struggled to their feet again I intend to make Waring Ridgway a
pauper

Stephen Eaton could have conceived nothing more merciless than this
mans callous pronouncement than the calm certainty of his
unemphasized words He started to reply but Harley took the words out
of his mouth

Dont make a mistake Dont tie to the paltry successes he has gained
I have not really begun to fight yet

The young man had nothing to say His heart was water He accepted
Harleys words as true for he had told himself the same thing a
hundred times Why had Ridgway rejected the overtures of this colossus
of finance It had been the sheerest folly born of madness to suppose
that anybody could stand against him

For Ridgway the die is cast the iron voice went on He is doomed
beyond hope But there is still a chance for you What do you consider
your interest in the Mesa Oreproducing Company worth Mr Eaton

The sudden question caught Eaton with the force of a surprise About
three hundred thousand dollars he heard himself say and it seemed to
him that his voice was speaking the words without his volition

Im going to buy you out for twice that sum Furthermore Im going to
take care of your futuregoing to see that you have a chance to rise

The waverers will was in flux but the loyalty in him still protested
I cant desert my chief Mr Harley

Do you call it desertion to leave a raging madman in a sinking boat
after you have urged him to seek the safety of another ship

He made me what I am

And I will make you ten times what you are With Ridgway you have no
chance to be anything but a subordinate He is the Mesa Oreproducing
Company and you are merely a cipher I offer your individuality a
chance I believe in you and know you to be a strong man No ironic
smile touched Harleys face at this statement You need a chance and
I offer it to you For your own sake take it

Every grievance Eaton had ever felt against his chief came trooping to
his mind He was domineering He did ride roughshod over his allies
opinions and follow the course he had himself mapped out All the glory
of the victory he absorbed as his due In the popular opinion Eaton
was as a farthingcandle to a great electric searchlight in comparison
with Ridgway

He trusts me the tempted man urged weakly He was slipping and he
knew it even while he assured himself he would never betray his chief

He would sell you out tomorrow if it paid him And what is he but a
robber Every dollar of his holdings is stolen from me I ask only
restitution of youand I propose to buy at twice nay at three times
the value of your stolen property You owe that freebooter no loyalty

I cant do it I cant do it

You shall do it Harley dominated him as bullying schoolmaster does a
cringing boy under the lash

I cant do it the young man repeated all his weak will flung into
the denial

Would you choose ruin

Perhaps I dont know he faltered miserable

Its merely a business proposition young man The stock you have to
sell is valuable today Reject my offer and a month from now it will
be quoted on the market at half its present figure and go begging at
that It will be absolutely worthless before I finish You are not
selling out Ridgway He is a ruined man anyway But youI am going to
save you in spite of yourself I am going to shake you from that
robbers clutches

Eaton got to his feet pallid and limp as a rag Dont tempt me he
cried hoarsely I tell you I cant do it sir

Harleys cold eye did not release him for an instant One million
dollars and an assured future orabsolute utter ruin complete and
final

He would murder meand he ought to groaned the writhing victim

No fear of that Ill put you where he cant reach you Just sign your
name to this paper Mr Eaton

I didnt agree I didnt say I would

Sign here Or wait one moment till I get witnesses Harley touched
a bell and his secretary appeared in the doorway Ask Mr Mott and
young Jarvis to step this way

Harley held out the pen toward Eaton looking steadily at him In a
strong man the human eye is a sword among weapons Eaton quailed The
fingers of the unhappy wretch went out mechanically for the pen He was
sweating terror and remorse but the essential weakness of the man
could not stand out unbacked against the masterful force of this mans
imperious will He wrote his name in the places directed and flung
down the pen like a child in a rage

Now get me out of Montana before Ridgway knows he cried brokenly

You may leave tomorrow night Mr Eaton Youll only have to appear
in court once personally Well arrange it quietly for tomorrow
afternoon Ridgway wont know until it is done and you are gone



CHAPTER 20 A LITTLE LUNCH AT APHONSES

It chanced that Ridgway through the swinging door of a department
store caught a glimpse of Miss Balfour as he was striding along the
street He bethought him that it was the hour of luncheon and that she
was no end better company than the revamped noon edition of the morning
paper Wherefore he wheeled into the store and interrupted her
inspection of gloves

I know the bulliest little French restaurant tucked away in a side
street just three blocks from here The happiness disseminated in this
world by that chefs salads will some day carry him past St Peter with
no questions asked

You believe in salvation by works she parried while she considered
his invitation

So will you after a trial of Alphonses salad

Am I to understand that I am being invited to a theological discussion
of a heavenly salad concocted by Father Alphonse

That is about the specifications

Then I accept For a week my conscience has condemned me for excess of
frivolity You offer me a chance to expiate without discomfort That is
my idea of heaven I have always believed it a place where one pastures
in rich meadows of pleasure with penalties and consciences all
excluded from its domains

You should start a church he laughed It would have a great
followingespecially if you could operate your heaven this side of the
Styx

She found his restaurant all he had claimed and more The little
corner of old Paris set her eyes shining The fittings were Parisian to
the least detail Even the waiter spoke no English

But I dont see how they make it pay How did he happen to come here
Are there enough people that appreciate this kind of thing in Mesa to
support it

He smiled at her enthusiasm Hardly The place has a scarce dozen of
regular patrons Hobart comes here a good deal So does Eaton But it
doesnt pay financially You see I know because I happen to own it I
used to eat at Alphonses restaurant in Paris So I sent for him It
doesnt follow that one has to be less a slave to the artificial
comforts of a supercivilized world because one lives at Mesa

I see it doesnt You are certainly a wonderful man

Name anything you like Ill warrant Alphonse can make good if it is
not outside of his national cuisine he boasted

She did not try his capacity to the limit but the oysters the salad
the chicken soup were delicious with the ultimate perfection that
comes only out of Gaul

They made a delightfully gay and intimate hour of it and were still
lingering over their demitasse when Yeslers name was mentioned

Isnt it splendid that hes doing so well cried the girl with
enthusiasm The doctor says that if the bullet had gone a fraction of
an inch lower he would have died Most men would have died anyhow
they say It was his clean outdoor life and magnificent constitution
that saved him

Thats what pulled him through he nodded It would have done his
heart good to see how many friends he had His recovery was a
continuous performance ovation It would have been a poorer world for a
lot of people if Sam Yesler had crossed the divide

Yes It would have been a very much poorer one for several I know

He glanced shrewdly at her Ive learned to look for a particular
application when you wear that particularly sapient air of mystery

Her laugh admitted his hit Well I was thinking of Laska I begin to
think HER fair prince has come

Meaning Yesler

Yes She hasnt found it out herself yet She only knows she is
tremendously interested

Hes a prince all right though he isnt quite a fairy The woman that
gets him will be lucky

The man that gets Laska will be more than lucky she protested
loyally

I dare say he agreed carelessly But then good women are not so
rare as good men There are still enough of them left to save the
world But when it comes to men like Samwell it would take a
Diogenes to find another

I dont see how even Mr Pelton angry as he was dared shoot him

He had been drinking hard for a week That will explain anything when
you add it to his temperament I never liked the fellow

I suppose that is why you saved his life when the miners took him and
were going to lynch him

I would not have lifted a hand for him Thats the bald truth But I
couldnt let the boys spoil the moral effect of their victory by so
gross a mistake It would have been playing right into Harleys hands

Can a man get over being drunk in five minutes I never saw anybody
more sober than Mr Pelton when the mob were crying for vengeance and
you were fighting them back

A great shock will sober a man Pelton is an errant coward and he had
pretty good reason to think he had come to the end of the passage The
boys werent playing They meant business

They would not have listened to another man in the world except you
she told him proudly

It was really Sam they listened towhen he sent out the message
asking them to let the law have its way

No I think it was the way you handled the message Youre a wizard at
a speech you know

Thanks

He glanced up for Alphonse was waiting at his elbow

Youre wanted on the telephone monsieur

You cant get away from business even for an hour can you she
rallied My heaven wouldnt suit you at all unless I smuggled in a
trust for you to fight

I expect it is Eaton he explained Steve phoned down to the office
that he isnt feeling well today I asked him to have me called up
here If he isnt better Im going to drop round and see him

But when she caught sight of his face as he returned she knew it was
serious

Whats the matter Is it Mr Eaton Is he very ill she cried

His face was set like broken ice refrozen Yes its Eaton They
saybut it cant be true

She had never seen him so moved What is it Waring

The boy has sold me out He is at the courthouse now undoing my
workthe Judas

The angry blood swept imperiously into her cheeks Dont waste any
more time with me Waring Gogo and save yourself from the traitor
Perhaps it is not too late yet

He flung her a grateful look Youre true blue Virginia Come Ill
leave you at the store as we pass

The defection of Eaton bit his chief to the quick The force of the
blow itself was heavyhow heavy he could not tell till he could take
stock of the situation He could see that he would be thrown out of
court in the matter of the Consolidated Supply Company receivership
since Eatons stock would now be in the hands of the enemy But what
was of more importance was the fact that Eatons interest in the Mesa
Oreproducing Company now belonged to Harley who could work any amount
of mischief with it as a lever for litigation

The effect too of the mans desertion upon the morale of the M O P
forces must be considered and counteracted if possible He fancied he
could see his subordinates looking shiftyeyed at each other and
wondering who would slip away next

If it had been anybody but Steve He would as soon have distrusted his
right hand as Steve Eaton Why he had made the man had picked him out
when he was a mere clerk and tied him to himself by a hundred favors
Up on the Snake River he had saved Steves life once when he was
drowning The boy had always been as close to him as a brother That
Steve should turn traitor was not conceivable He knew all his intimate
plans stood second to himself in the company Oh it was a numbing
blow Ridgways sense of personal loss and outrage almost obliterated
for the moment his appreciation of the business loss

The motion to revoke the receivership of the Supply Company was being
argued when Ridgway entered the courtroom Within a few minutes the
news had spread like wildfire that Eaton was lined up with the
Consolidated and already the paltry dozen of loafers in the courtroom
had swelled into hundreds all of them eager for any sensation that
might develop

Ridgways broad shoulders flung aside the crowd and opened a way to the
vacant chair waiting for him One of his lawyers had the floor and was
flaying Eaton with a vitriolic tongue the while men craned forward all
over the room to get a glimpse of the traitors face

Eaton sat beside Mott drylipped and pallid his set eyes staring
vacantly into space Once or twice he flung a furtive glance about him
His stripped and naked soul was enduring a foretaste of the Judgment
Day The whip of scorn with which the lawyer lashed him cut into his
shrinking sensibilities and left him a welter of raw and livid wales
Good God why had he not known it would be like this He was paying for
his treachery and usury and it was being burnt into him that as the
years passed he must continue to pay in selfcontempt and the distrust
of his fellows

The case had come to a hearing before Judge Hughes who was not one of
Ridgways creatures That on its merits it would be decided in favor of
the Consolidated was a foregone conclusion It was after the judge had
rendered the expected decision that the dramatic moment of the day came
to gratify the seasoned court frequenters

Eaton trying to slip as quietly as possible from the room came face
to face with his former chief For an interminable instant the man he
had betrayed blocking the way squarely held the trembling wretch in
the blaze of his scorn Ridgways contemptuous eyes sifted to the
ingrates soul until it shriveled Then he stood disdainfully to one
side so that the man might not touch him as he passed

Some one in the back of the room broke the tense silence and hissed
The damned Judas Instantly echoes of Judas Judas filled the
room and pursued Eaton to his cab It would be many years before he
could recall without scalding shame that moment when the finger of
public scorn was pointed at him in execration



CHAPTER 21 HARLEY SCORES

What Harley had sought in the subornation of Eaton had been as much the
moral effect of his defection as the tangible results themselves If he
could shake the confidence of the city and State in the freebooters
victorious star he would have done a good days work He wanted the
impression to spread that Ridgways success had passed its meridian

Nor did he fail of his purpose by more than a hairs breadth The talk
of the street saw the beginning of the end The common voice ran Its
God help Ridgway now Hes down and out

But Waring Ridgway was never more dangerous than in apparent defeat If
he were hit hard by Eatons treachery no sign of it was apparent in
the jaunty insouciance of his manner Those having business with him
expected to find him depressed and worried but instead met a man the
embodiment of vigorous and confident activity If the subject were
broached he was ready to laugh with them at Eatons folly in deserting
at the hour when victory was assured

It was fortunate for Ridgway that the county elections came on early in
the spring and gave him a chance to show that his power was still
intact He arranged to meet at once the political malcontents of the
State who were banded together against the growing influence of the
Consolidated He had a few days before called together representative
men from all parts of the State to discuss a program of action against
the enemy and Ridgway gave a dinner for them at the Quartzite the
evening of Eatons defection

He was at the critical moment when any obvious irresolution would have
been fatal His allies were ready to concede his defeat if he would let
them But he radiated such an assured atmosphere of power such an
unconquerable current of vigor that they could not escape his own
conviction of unassailability He was at his genial indomitable best
the magnetic charm of fellowship putting into eclipse the selfishness
of the man He had been known to boast of his political exploits of
how he had been the Warwick that had made and unmade governors and
United States senators but the fraternal we tonight replaced his
usual first person singular

The business interests of the Consolidated were supreme all over the
State That corporation owned forests and mills and railroads and
mines It ran sheep and cattleranches as well as stores and
manufactories Most of the newspapers in the State were dominated by
it Of a population of two hundred and fifty thousand it controlled
more than half directly by the simple means of filling dinnerpails
That so powerful a corporation greedy for power and wealth should
create a strong but scattered hostility in the course of its growth
became inevitable This enmity Ridgway proposed to consolidate into a
political organization with opposition to the trust as its cohesive
principle that should hold the balance of power in the State

When he rose to explain his object in calling them together Ridgways
clear strong presentment of the situation backed by his splendid bulk
and powerful personality always bold and dramatic shocked dormant
antagonisms to activity as a live current does sluggish inertia For he
had eminently the gift of moving speech The issue was a simple one he
pointed out Reduced to ultimates the question was whether the State
should control the Consolidated or the Consolidated the State With
simple telling force he faced the insidious growth of the big copper
company showing how every independent in the State was fighting for
his business life against its encroachments and was bound to lose
unless the opposition was a united one Let the independents obtain and
keep control of the State politically and the trust might be curbed
not otherwise In eternal vigilance and in union lay safety

He sat down in silence more impressive than any applause But after the
silence came a deluge of cheers the thunder of them sweeping up and
down the long table like a summer storm across a lake

Presently the floodgates of talk were unloosed and the conservatives
began to be heard Opposition was futile because it was too late they
claimed A young Irishman primed for the occasion jumped to his feet
with an impassioned harangue that pedestaled Ridgway as the Washington
of the West He showed how one man in coalition with the laborunions
had succeeded in carrying the State against the big copper company how
he had elected senators and governors and legislators and judges If
one man could so cripple the octopus what could the best blood of the
State standing together not accomplish He flung Patrick Henry and
Robert Emmet and Daniel Webster at their devoted heads demanding
liberty or death with the bridled eloquence of his race

But Ridgway was not such a tyro at the game of politics as to depend
upon speeches for results His fine hand had been working quietly for
months to bring the malcontents into one camp shaping every passion to
which men are heir to serve his purpose As he looked down the table he
could read in the faces before him hatred revenge envy fear hope
avarice recklessness and even love as the motives which he must fuse
to one common end His vanity stood on tiptoe at his superb skill in
playing on mens wills He knew he could mold these men to work his
desire and the sequel showed he was right

When the votes were counted at the end of the bitter campaign that
followed Simon Harleys candidates went down to disastrous defeat all
over the State though he had spent money with a lavish hand In Mesa
County Ridgway had elected every one of his judges and retired to
private life those he could not influence

Harleys grim lips tightened when the news reached him Very well he
said to Mott Well see if these patriots cant be reached through
their stomachs better than their brains Order every mill and mine and
smelter of the Consolidated closed tonight Our employees have voted
for this man Ridgway Let him feed them or let them starve

But the cost to youwont it be enormous asked Mott startled at
his chiefs drastic decision

Harley bared his fangs with a wolfish smile Well make the public
pay Our storehouses are full of copper Prices will jump when the
supply is reduced fifty per cent Well sell at an advance and clean
up a few millions out of the shutdown Meanwhile well starve this
patriotic State into submission

It came to pass even as Harley had predicted With the Consolidated
mines closed copper jumped upupup The trust could sit still and
coin money without turning a hand while its employees suffered in the
long bitter Northern winter All the troubles usually pursuant on a
long strike began to fall upon the families of the miners

When a delegation from the miners union came to discuss the situation
with Harley he met them blandly with many platitudes of sympathy He
regrettedhe regretted exceedinglythe necessity that had been forced
upon him of closing the mines He had delayed doing so in the hope that
the situation might be relieved But it had grown worse until he had
been forced to close No he was afraid he could not promise to reopen
this winter unless something were done to ameliorate conditions in the
court Work would begin at once however if the legislators would pass
a bill making it optional with any party to a suit to have the case
transferred to another judge in case he believed the bias of the
presiding judge would be prejudicial to an impartial hearing

Ridgway was flung at once upon the defensive His allies the working
men demanded of him that his legislature pass the bill wanted by
Harley in order that work might recommence He evaded their demands by
proposing to arbitrate his difficulties with the Consolidated by
offering to pay into the union treasury hall a million dollars to help
carry its members through the winter He argued to the committee that
Harley was bluffing that within a few weeks the mines and smelters
would again be running at their full capacity but when the pressure on
the legislators he had elected became so great that he feared they
would be swept from their allegiance to him he was forced to yield to
the clamor

It was a great victory for Harley Nobody recognized how great a one
more accurately than Waring Ridgway The leader of the octopus had
dogged him over the shoulders of the people had destroyed at a single
blow one of his two principal sources of power He could no longer rely
on the courts to support him regardless of justice

Very well If he could not play with cogged dice he was gambler enough
to take the honest chances of the game without flinching No despair
rang in his voice The look in his eye was still warm and confident
Mesa questioned him with glimpses friendly but critical They found no
fear in his bearing no hint of doubt in his indomitable assurance



CHAPTER 22 NOT GUILTYGUILTY

Ridgways answer to the latest move of Simon Harley was to put him on
trial for his life to answer the charge of having plotted and
instigated the death of Vance Edwards Not without reason the defense
had asked for a change of venue alleging the impossibility of securing
a fair trial at Mesa The courts had granted the request and removed
the case to Avalanche

On the second day of the trial Aline sat beside her husband a dainty
little figure of fear shrinking from the observation focused upon her
from all sides The sight of her forlorn sensitiveness so touched
Ridgways heart that he telegraphed Virginia Balfour to come and help
support her through the ordeal

Virginia came and henceforth two women both of them young and
unusually attractive gave countenance to the man being tried for his
life Not that he needed their support for himself but for the effect
they might have on the jury Harley had shrewdly guessed that the
whitefaced child he had married whose pathetic beauty was of so
haunting a type and whose big eyes were so quick to reflect emotions
would be a valuable asset to set against the blackclad widow of Vance
Edwards

For its effect upon himself so far as the trial was concerned Simon
Harley cared not a whit He needed no bolstering The old wrecker
carried an iron face to the ordeal His leathern heart was as foreign
to fear as to pity The trial was an unpleasant bore to him but
nothing worse He had of course cast an anchor of caution to windward
by taking care to have the jury fixed For even though his array of
lawyers was a formidably famous one he was no such child as to trust
his case to a Western jury on its merits while the undercurrent of
popular opinion was setting so strongly against him Nor had he
neglected to see that the courtroom was packed with detectives to
safeguard him in the event that the sympathy of the attending miners
should at any time become demonstrative against him

The most irritating feature of the trial to the defendant was the
presence of the little woman in black whose burning eyes never left
for long his face He feigned to be unconscious of her regard but
nobody in the courtroom was more sure of that look of enduring
passionate hatred than its victim He had made her a widow and her
heart cried for revenge That was the story the eyes told dumbly

From first to last the case was bitterly contested and always with the
realization among those presentexcept for that somber figure in
black whose beady eyes gimleted the defendantthat it was another
move in the fight between the rival copper kings The district attorney
had worked up his case very carefully not with much hope of securing a
conviction but to mass a total of evidence that would condemn the
Consolidated leaderbefore the world

To this end the foreman Donleavy had been driven by a process of
sweating to turn States evidence against his master His testimony
made things look black for Harley but when Hobart took the stand a
palpably unwilling witness and supported his evidence the Ridgway
adherents were openly jubilant The lawyers for the defense made much
of the fact that Hobart had just left the Consolidated service after a
disagreement with the defendant and had been elected to the senate by
his enemies but the impression made by his moderation and the fine
restraint of his manner combined with his reputation for scrupulous
honesty was not to be shaken by the subtle innuendos and blunt
aspersions of the legal array he faced

Nor did the young district attorney content himself with Hobarts
testimony He put his successor Mott on the stand and gave him a bad
hour while he tried to wring the admission out of him that Harley had
personally ordered the attack on the miners of the Taurus But for the
almost constant objections of the opposing counsel which gave him time
to recover himself the prosecuting attorney would have succeeded

Ridgway meeting him by chance after luncheon at the foot of the hotel
elevatorfor in a town the size of Avalanche Waring had found it
necessary to put up at the same hotel as the enemy or take second best
an alternative not to his fastidious tasterallied him upon the
predicament in which he had found himself

Its pretty hard to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but
the truth without making indiscreet admissions about ones friends
isnt it he asked with his genial smile

Did I make any indiscreet admissions

I dont say you did though you didnt look as if you were enjoying
yourself I picked up an impression that you had your back to the wall
seemed to me the jury rather sized it up that way Mott

Well know what the jury thinks in a few days

Shall we the other laughed aloud Now Im wondering whether we
shall know what they really think

If you mean that the jury has been tampered with it is your duty to
place your evidence before the court Mr Ridgway

When I hear the verdict Ill tell you what I think about the jury
returned the president of the Oreproducing Company with easy
impudence as he passed into the elevator

At the second floor Waring left it and turned toward the ladies
parlor It had seemed to him that Aline had looked very tired and frail
at the morning session and he wanted to see Virginia about arranging
to have them take a long drive into the country that afternoon He had
sent his card up with a penciled note to the effect that he would wait
for her in the parlor

But when he stepped through the double doorway of the ornate room it
was to become aware of a prior occupant She was reclining on a divan
at the end of the large public room Neither lying nor sitting but
propped up among a dozen pillows with head and limbs inert and the long
lashes drooped on the white cheeks Aline looked the pathetic figure of
a child fallen asleep from sheer exhaustion after a long strain

Since he was the man he was unhampered by any too fine sense of what
was fitting he could no more help approaching than he could help the
passionate pulse of pity that stirred in his heart at sight of her
forlorn weariness

Her eyes opened to find his grave compassion looking down at her She
showed no surprise at his presence though she had not previously known
of it Nor did she move by even so much as the stir of a limb

This is wearing you out he said after the long silence in which her
gaze was lost helplessly in his You must go homeaway from it all
You must forget it and if it ever crosses your mind think of it as
something with which you have no concern

How can I do thatnow

The last word slipped out not of her will but from an undisciplined
heart It stood for the whole tangled story of her troubles the
unloved marriage which had bereft her of her heritage of youth and joy
the love that had found her too late and was so poignant a fount of
distress to her the web of untoward circumstance in which she was so
inextricably entangled

How did you ever come to do it he asked roughly out of the bitter
impulse of his heart

She knew that the harshness was not for her as surely as she knew what
he meant by his words

I did wrong I know that now but I didnt know it then Though even
then I felt troubled about it But my guardian said it was best and I
knew so little Oh so very very little Why was I not taught things
what every girl has a right to knowuntil life teaches metoo late

Nothing he could say would comfort her For the inexorable facts
forbade consolation She had made shipwreck of her life before the
frail raft of her destiny had well pushed forth from harbor He would
have given much to have been able to take the sadness out of her great
childeyes but he knew that not even by the greatness of his desire
could he take up her burden She must carry it alone or sink under it

You must go away from here back to your people If not now then as
soon as the trial is over Make him take you to your friends for a
time

I have no friends that can help me She said it in an even little
voice of despair

You have many friends You have made some here Virginia is one He
would not name himself as only a friend though he had set his iron
will to claim no more

Yes Virginia is my friend She is good to me But she is going to
marry you and then you will both forget me

I shall never forget you He cried it in a low tense voice his
clenched hands thrust into the pockets of his sack coat

Her wan smile thanked him It was the most he would let himself say
Though her heart craved more she knew she must make the most of this

I came up to see Virginia he went on with a change of manner I
want her to take you driving this afternoon Forget about that wretched
trial if you can Nothing of importance will take place today

He turned at the sound of footsteps and saw that Miss Balfour had come
into the room

I want you to take Mrs Harley into the fresh sunshine and clear air
this afternoon I have been telling her to forget this trial Its a
farce anyhow Nothing will come of it Take her out to the Homestake
and cheer her up

Yes my lord Virginia curtseyed obediently

It will do you good too

She shot a mocking little smile at him Its very good of you to think
of me

Still I do sometimes

Whenever it is convenient she added

But with Aline watching them the spirit of badinage in him was
overmatched He gave it up and asked what kind of a rig he should send
round Virginia furnished him the necessary specifications and he
turned to go

As he left the room Simon Harley entered They met face to face and
after an instants pause each drew aside to allow the other to pass
The New Yorker inclined his head silently and moved forward toward his
wife Ridgway passed down the corridor and into the elevator

As the days of the trial passed excitement grew more tense The lawyers
for the prosecution and the defense made their speeches to a crowded
and enthralled courtroom There was a feverish uncertainty in the air
It reached a climax when the jury stayed out for eleven hours before
coming to a verdict From the moment it filed back into the courtroom
with solemn faces the dramatic tensity began to foreshadow the tragedy
about to be enacted The woman Harley had made a widow sat erect and
rigid in the seat where she had been throughout the trial Her eyes
blazed with a hatred that bordered madness Ridgway had observed that
neither Aline Harley nor Virginia was present and a note from the
latter had just reached him to the effect that Aline was ill with the
strain of the long trial Afterward Ridgway could never thank his pagan
gods enough that she was absent

There was a moment of tense waiting before the judge asked

Gentlemen of the jury have you reached a verdict

The foreman rose We have your honor

A folded note was handed to the judge He read it slowly with an
inscrutable face

Is this your verdict gentlemen of the jury

It is your honor

Silence full and rigid held the room after the words Not guilty had
fallen from the lips of the judge The stillness was broken by a shock
as of an electric bolt from heaven

The exploding echoes of a pistolshot reverberated Men sprang wildly
to their feet gazing at each other in the distrust that fear
generates But one man was beyond being startled by any more earthly
sounds His head fell forward on the table in front of him and a thin
stream of blood flowed from his lips It was Simon Harley found
guilty sentenced and executed by the judge and jury sitting in the
outraged insane heart of the woman he had made a widow

Mrs Edwards had shot him through the head with a revolver she had
carried in her shoppingbag to exact vengeance in the event of a
miscarriage of justice



CHAPTER 23 ALINE TURNS A CORNER

Aline might have been completely prostrated by the news of her
husbands sudden end coming as it did as the culmination of a week of
strain and horror That she did not succumb was due perhaps to
Ridgways care for her When Harleys massive gray head had dropped
forward to the table his enemys first thought had been of her As
soon as he knew that death was sure he hurried to the hotel

He sent his card up and followed it so immediately that he found her
scarcely risen from the divan on which she had been lying in the
receivingroom of her apartments The sleep was not yet shaken from her
lids nor was the wrinkled flush smoothed from the soft cheek that had
been next the cushion Even in his trouble for her he found time to be
glad that Virginia was not at the moment with her It gave him the
sense of another bond between them that this tragic hour should belong
to him and her alonethis hour of destiny when their lives swung round
a corner beyond which lay wonderful vistas of kindly sunbeat and dewy
starlight stretching to the horizons edge of the long adventure

She checked the rush of glad joy in her heart the sight of him always
brought and came forward slowly One glance at his face showed that he
had brought grave news

What is it Why are you here she cried tensely

To bring you trouble Aline

Trouble Her hand went to her heart quickly

It is aboutMr Harley

She questioned him with wide startled eyes words hesitating on her
trembling lips and flying unvoiced

Childlittle partnerthe orders are to be brave He came forward
and took her hands in his looking down at her with eyes she thought
full of infinitely kind pity

Is ithave theydo you mean the verdict

Yes the verdict but not the verdict of which you are thinking

She turned a quivering face to his Tell me I shall be brave

He told her the brutal fact as gently as he could while he watched the
blood ebb from her face As she swayed he caught her in his arms and
carried her to the divan When presently her eyes fluttered open it
was to look into his pitiful ones He was kneeling beside her and her
head was pillowed on his arm

Say it isnt true she murmured

It is true dear

She moved her head restlessly and he took away his arm rising to draw
a chair close to the lounge She slipped her two hands under her head
letting them lie palm to palm on the sofapillow The violet eyes looked
past him into space Her tangled thoughts were in a chaos of disorder
Even though she had known but a few months and loved not at all the
grim grayhaired man she had called husband the sense of wretched
bereavement the nearness of death was strong on her He had been kind
to her in his way and the inevitable closeness of their relationship
repugnant as it had been to her made its claims felt An hour ago he
had been standing here the strong and virile ruler over thousands Now
he lay stiff and cold all his power shorn from him without a seconds
warning He had kissed her goodby solicitous for her welfare and it
had been he that had been in need of care rather than she Two big
tears hung on her lids and splashed to her cheeks She began to sob
and halfturned on the divan burying her face in her hands

Ridgway let her weep without interruption for a time knowing that it
would be a relief to her surcharged heart and overwrought nerves But
when her sobs began to abate she became aware of his hand resting on
her shoulder She sat up wiping her eyes and turned to him a face
sodden with grief

You are good to me she said simply

If my goodness were only less futile Heaven knows what I would give
to ward off trouble from you But I cant nor can I bear it for you

But it is a help to know you would if you could HeI think he wanted
to ward off grief from me but he could not either I was often lonely
and sad even though he was kind to me And now he has gone I wish I
had told him how much I appreciated his goodness to me

Yes we all feel that when we have lost some one we love It is
natural to wish we had been better to them and showed them how much we
cared Let me tell you about my mother I was thirteen when she died
It was in summer She had not been well for a long time The boys were
going fishing that day and she asked me to stay at home I had set my
heart on going and I thought it was only a fancy of hers She did not
insist on my staying so I went but felt uncomfortable all day When I
came back in the evening they told me she was dead I felt as if some
great icy hand were tightening on my heart Somehow I couldnt break
down and cry it out I went around with a white set face and gave no
sign Even at the funeral it was the same The neighbors called me
hardhearted and pointed me out to their sons as a terrible warning
And all the time I was torn with agony

You poor boy

And one night she came to me in a dream She did not look as she had
just before she died but strong and beautiful with the color in her
face she used to have She smiled at me and kissed me and rumpled my
hair as she used to do I knew then it was all right She understood
and I didnt care whether others did or not I woke up crying and
after I had had my grief out I was myself again

It was so sweet of her to think to come to you She must have been
loving you up in heaven and saw you were troubled and came down just
to comfort you and tell you it was all right the girl cried with soft
sympathy

Thats how I understood it Of course I was only a boy but somehow I
knew it was more than a dream Im not a spiritualist I dont believe
such things happen but I know it happened to me he finished
illogically with a smile

She sighed He was always so thoughtful of me too I do wish I
hadcould have beenmore

She broke off without finishing but he understood

You must not blame yourself for that He would be the first to tell
you so He took you for what you could give him and these last days
were the best he had known for many years

He was so good to me Oh you dont know how good

It was a great pleasure to him to be good to you the greatest
pleasure he knew

She looked up as he spoke and saw shining deep in his eyes the spirit
that had taught him to read so well the impulse of another lover and
seeing it she dropped her eyes quickly in order not to see what was
there With him it had been only an instants uncontrollable surge of
ecstasy He meant to wait Every instinct of the decent thing told him
not to take advantage of her weakness her need of love to rest upon in
her trouble her transparent care for him and confidence in him so
childlike in its entirety For convention he did not care a turn of his
hand but he would do nothing that might shock her selfrespect when
she came to think of it later Sternly he brought himself back to
realities

Shall I see Mr Mott for you and send him here It would be better
that he should make the arrangements than I

If you please I shall not see you again before I go then Her lips
trembled as she asked the question

I shall come down to the hotel again and see you before you go And
now goodby Be brave and dont reproach yourself Remember that he
would not wish it

The door opened and Virginia came in flushed with rapid walking She
had heard the news on the street and had hurried back to the hotel

Her eyes asked of Ridgway Does she know and he answered in the
affirmative Straight to Aline she went and wrapped her in her arms
the latent mothering instinct that is in every woman aroused and
dormant

Oh my dear my dear she cried softly

Ridgway slipped quietly from the room and left them together



CHAPTER 24 A GOOD SAMARITAN

Yesler still moving slowly with a walking stick by reason of his green
wound left the streetcar and made his way up Forest Road to the house
which bore the number 792 In the remote past there had been some
spasmodic attempt to cultivate grass and raise some shadetrees along
the sidewalks but this had long since been given up as abortive An
air of decay hung over the street the unmistakable suggestion of
better days This was writ large over the house in front of which
Yesler stopped The gate hung on one hinge boards were missing from
the walk and a dilapidated shutter which had once been green swayed
in the breeze

A woman of about thirty dark and pretty but poorly dressed came to
the door in answer to his ring Two little children a boy and a girl
with their mothers shy longlashed Southern eyes of brown clung to
her skirts and gazed at the stranger

This is where Mr Pelton lives is it not he asked

Yes sir

Is he at home

Yes sir

May I see him

Hes sick

Im sorry to hear it Too sick to be seen If not I should like very
much to see him I have business with him

The young woman looked at him a little defiantly and a little
suspiciously Are you a reporter

Sam smiled No maam

Does he owe you money He could see the underlying blood dye her
dusky cheeks when she asked the question desperately as it seemed to
him with a kind of brazen shame to which custom had inured her She had
somehow the air of some gentle little creature of the forests defending
her young

Not a cent maam I dont want to do him any harm

I didnt hear your name

I havent mentioned it he admitted with the sunny smile that was a
letter of recommendation in itself Fact is Id rather not tell it
till he sees me

From an adjoining room a querulous voice broke into their conversation
Who is it Norma

A gentleman to see you Tom

Who is it more sharply

It is I Mr Pelton I came to have a talk with you Yesler pushed
forward into the dingy sittingroom with the pertinacity of a
bookagent I heard you were not well and I came to find out if I can
do anything for you

The stout man lying on the lounge grew pale before the blood reacted in
a purple flush His very bulk emphasized the shabbiness of the stained
and almost buttonless Prince Albert coat he wore the dinginess of the
little room he seemed to dwarf

Leave my house seh You have ruined this family and you come to
gloat on your handiwork Take a good look and then go Mr Yesler You
see my wife in cotton rags doing her own work Is it enough seh

The slim little woman stepped across the room and took her place beside
her husband Her eyes flashed fire at the man she held responsible for
the fall of her husband Yeslers generous heart applauded the loyalty
which was proof against both disgrace and poverty For in the past
month both of these had fallen heavily upon her Tom Pelton had always
lived well and during the past few years he had speculated in ventures
far beyond his means Losses had pursued him and he had looked to the
senatorship to recoup himself and to stand off the creditors pressing
hard for payment Instead he had been exposed disgraced and finally
disbarred for attempted bribery Like a horde of hungry rats his
creditors had pounced upon the discredited man and wrested from him the
remnants of his mortgaged property He had been forced to move into a
mere cottage and was a man without a future For the only profession at
which he had skill enough to make a living was the one from which he
had been cast as unfit to practise it The ready sympathy of the
cattleman had gone out to the politician who was down and out He had
heard the situation discussed enough to guess pretty close to the
facts and he could not let himself rest until he had made some effort
to help the man whom his exposure had ruined or rather had hastened
to ruin for that result had been for years approaching

Im sorry Mr Pelton If Ive injured you I want to make it right

Make it right The former congressman got up with an oath Make it
right Can you give me back my reputation my future Can you take away
the shame that has come upon my wife and that my children will have to
bear in the years to come Can you give us back our home our comfort
our peace of mind

No I cant do this but I can help you to do it all the cattleman
made answer quietly

He offered no defense though he knew perfectly well none was needed
He had no responsibility in the calamity that had befallen this family
Peltons wrongdoing had come home to those he loved and he could
rightly blame nobody but himself However much he might arraign those
who had been the agents of his fall he knew in his heart that the
fault had been his own

Norma Pelton tensely selfrepressed spoke now How can you do this
sir

I cant do it so long as you hold me for an enemy maam Im ready to
cry quits with your husband and try a new deal If I injured him he
tried to even things up Well lets say things are squared and start
fresh Ive got a business proposition to make if youre willing to
listen to it

What sort of a proposition

Im running about twentyfive thousand sheep up in the hills Ive
just bought a ranch with a comfortable ranchhouse on it for a kind of
central point My winter feeding will all be done from it as a chief
place of distribution Same with the shearing and shipping I want a
good man to put in charge of my sheep as head manager and I would be
willing to pay a proper salary There aint any reason why this
shouldnt work into a partnership if he makes good With wool jumping
as its going to do in the next four years the right kind of man can
make himself independent for life My idea is to increase my holdings
right along and let my manager in as a partner as soon as he shows he
is worth it Now that ranchhouse is a decent place Theres a pretty
good school maam for the children The folks round that neighborhood
may not have any frills but

Are you offering Tom the place as manager she demanded in amazement

That was my idea maam Its not what you been used to o course
but if youre looking for a change I thought Id speak of it he said
diffidently

She looked at him in a dumb surprise She too in her heart knew that
this man was blameless He had done his duty and had nearly lost his
life for it at the hands of her husband Now he had come to lift them
out of the hideous nightmare into which they had fallen He had come to
offer them peace and quiet and plenty in exchange for the future of
poverty and shame and despair which menaced them They were to escape
into Gods great hills away from the averted looks and whispering
tongues and the temptations to drown his trouble that so constantly
beset the father of her children Despite his faults she still loved
Tom Pelton he was a kind and loving husband and father Out on the
range there still waited a future for him When she thought of it a
lump rose in her throat for very happiness She who had been like a
rock beside him in his trouble broke down now and buried her head in
her husbands coat

Dont you honeynow dont you cry The big man had lost all his
pomposity and was comforting his sweetheart as simply as a boy Its
all been my fault Ive been doing wrong for yearstrying to pull
myself out of the mire by my bootstraps By Gad youre a man Sam
Yesler thats what you are If I dont turn ovah a new leaf Id ought
to be shot Well make a fresh start sweetheart Dash me Im nothing
but a dashed baby And with that the overwrought man broke down too

Yesler moved a good deal himself maintained the burden of the
conversation cheerfully

Thats all settled then Tell you Im right glad to get a competent
man to put in charge Things have been running at loose ends because I
havent the time to look after them This takes a big load off my mind
You better arrange to go up there with me as soon as you have time
Pelton and look the ground over Youll want to make some changes if
you mean to take your family up there Better to spend a few hundreds
and have things the way you want them for Mrs Pelton than to move in
with things not up to the mark Of course Ill put the house in the
shape you want it But we can talk of that after we look it over

In his embarrassment he looked so much the boy so much the culprit
caught stealing apples and up for sentence that Norma Peltons
gratitude took courage She came across to him and held out both hands
the shimmer of tears still in the soft brown eyes

Youve given us more than life Mr Yesler You cant ever know what
you have done for us Some things are worse than death to some people
I dont mean poverty butother things We can begin again far away
from this tainted air that has poisoned us I know it isnt good form
to be saying this One shouldnt have feelings in public But I dont
care I think of the childrenand Tom I didnt expect ever to be
happy again but we shall I feel it

She broke down again and dabbed at her eyes with her kerchief Sam
very much embarrassed but not at all displeased at this display of
feeling patted her dark hair and encouraged her to composure

There Its all right now maam Sure youll be happy Any mother
thats got kids like these

He caught up the little girl in his arms by way of diverting attention
from himself

This gave a new notion to the impulsive little woman

I want you to kiss them both Come here Kennie This is Mr Yesler
and he is the best man youve ever seen I want you to remember that he
has been our best friend

Yes mama

Oh sho maam protested the overwhelmed cattleman kissing both the
children nevertheless

Pelton laughed He felt a trifle hysterical himself If she thinks it
shell say it when she feels that way Im right surprised she dont
kiss you too

I will announced Norma promptly with a pretty little tide of color

She turned toward him and Yesler laughing met the red lips of the
new friend he had made

Now youve got just grounds for shooting me he said gaily and
instantly regretted his infelicitous remark

For both husband and wife fell grave at his words It was Pelton that
answered them

Ive been taught a lesson Mr Yesler Im never going to pack a gun
again as long as I live unless Im hunting or something of that sort
and Im never going to drink another drop of liquor Its all right for
some men but it isnt right for me

Glad to hear it I never did believe in the hippocket habit Ive
lived here twenty years and I never found it necessary except on
special occasions When it comes to whisky I reckon wed all be better
without it

Yesler made his escape at the earliest opportunity and left them alone
together He lunched at the club attended to some correspondence he
had and about 330 drifted down the street toward the postoffice He
had expectations of meeting a young woman who often passed about that
time on her way home from school duties

It was however another young woman whose bow he met in front of
Mesas largest department store

Good afternoon Miss Balfour

She nodded greeting and cast eyes of derision on him

Ive been hearing about you Arent you ashamed of yourself

Yes maam What for in particular There are so many things

Youre a fine Christian arent you she scoffed

I aint much of a one Thats a fact he admitted What is it this
timepoker

No it isnt poker Worse than that Youve been setting a deplorable
example to the young

To young ladieslike Miss Virginia he wanted to know

No to young Christians I dont know what our good deacons will say
about it She illuminated her severity with a flashing smile Dont
you know that the sins of the fathers are to descend upon their
children even to the third and fourth generation Dont you know that
when a man does wrong he must die punished and his children and his
wife of course and that the proper thing to do is to stand back and
thank Heaven we havent been vile sinners

Now dont you begin on that Miss Virginia he warned

And after the man had disgraced himself and shot you after all
respectable people had given him an extra kick to let him know he must
stay down and had then turned their backs upon him Im not surprised
that youre ashamed

Where did you get hold of this fairytale he plucked up courage to
demand

From Norma Pelton She told me everything the whole story from
beginning to end

Its right funny you should be calling on her and you a respectable
young ladyunless you went to deliver that extra kick you was
mentioning he grinned

She dropped her raillery It was splendid I meant to ask Mr Ridgway
to do something for them but this is so much better It takes them
away from the place of his disgrace and away from temptation Oh I
dont wonder Norma kissed you

She told you that too did she

Yes I should have done it too in her place

He glanced round placidly Its a right public place here but

Dont be afraid Im not going to And before she disappeared within
the portals of the department store she gave him one last thrust Its
not so public up in the library Perhaps if you happen to be going that
way

She left her communication a fragment but he thought it worth acting
upon Among the library shelves he found Laska deep in a new volume on
domestic science

This aint any kind of day to be fooling away your time on cookbooks
Come out into the sun and live he invited

They walked past the gallowsframes and the slagdumps and the
shafthouses into the brown hills beyond the point where green copper
streaks showed and spurred the greed of man It was a day of spring
sunshine the good old earth astir with her annual recreation The
roadside was busy with this serious affair of living Ants and crawling
things moved to and fro about their business Squirrels raced across
the road and stood up at a safe distance to gaze at these intruders
Birds flashed back and forth hurried little carpenters busy with the
specifications for their new nests Eager palpitating life was the
keynote of the universe

Virginia told me about the Peltons Laska said after a pause

Its spreading almost as fast as if it were a secret he smiled Im
expecting to find it in the paper when we get back

Im so glad you did it

Well youre to blame

I She looked at him in surprise

Partly You told me how things were going with them That seemed to
put it up to me to give Pelton a chance

I certainly didnt mean it that way I had no right to ask you to do
anything about it

Mebbe it was the facts put it up to me Anyhow I felt responsible

Mr Roper once told me that you always feel responsible when you hear
anybody is in trouble the young woman answered

Ropers a goat Nobody ever pays any attention to him

Presently they diverged from the road and sat down on a great flat rock
which dropped out from the hillside like a park seat For he was still
far from strong and needed frequent rests Their talk was desultory
for they had reached that stage of friendship at which it is not
necessary to bridge silence with idle small talk Here by some whim of
fate the word was spoken He knew he loved her but he had not meant
to say it yet

But when her steady gray eyes came back to his after a long stillness
the meeting brought him a strange feeling that forced his hand

I love you Laska Will you be my wife he asked quietly

Yes Sam she answered directly That was all It was settled with a
word There in the sunshine he kissed her and sealed the compact and
afterward when the sun was low among the hill spurs they went back
happily to take up again the work that awaited them



CHAPTER 25 FRIENDLY ENEMIES

Ridgway had promised Aline that he would see her soon and when he
found himself in New York he called at the big house on Fifth Avenue
which had for so long been identified as the home of Simon Harley It
bore his impress stamped on it Its austerity suggested the Puritan
rather than the classic conception of simplicity The immense rooms
were as chill as dungeons and the forlorn little figure in black lost
in the loneliness of their bleakness wandered to and fro among her
retinue of servants like a butterfly beating its wings against a pane
of glass

With both hands extended she ran forward to meet her guest

Im so glad so glad so glad to see you

The joynote in her voice was irrepressible She had been alone for
weeks with the conventional gloom that made an obsession of the shadow
of death which enveloped the house All voices and footsteps had been
subdued to harmonize with the grief of the mistress of this mausoleum
Now she heard the sharp tread of this man unafraid and saw the alert
vitality of his confident bearing It was like a breath of the hills to
a parched traveler

I told you I would come

Yes Ive been looking for you every day Ive checked each one off on
my calendar Its been three weeks and five days since I saw you

I thought it was a year he laughed and the sound of his uncurbed
voice rang strangely in this room given to murmurs

Tell me about everything How is Virginia and Mrs Mott and Mr
Yesler And is he really engaged to that sweet little schoolteacher
And how does Mr Hobart like being senator

Not more than a dozen questions permitted at a time Begin again
please

First then when did you reach the city

He consulted his watch Just two hours and twentyseven minutes ago

And how long are you going to stay

That depends

On what

For one thing on whether you treat me well he smiled

Oh Ill treat you well I never was so glad to see a real live
somebody in my life Its been pretty bad here She gave a dreary
little smile as she glanced around at the funereal air of the place
Do you know I dont think we think of death in the right way Or
maybe Im a heathen and havent the proper feelings

She had sat down on one of the stiff divans and Ridgway found a place
beside her

Suppose you tell me about it he suggested

I know I must be wrong and youll be shocked when you hear

Very likely

I cant help feeling that the living have rights too she began
dubiously If they would let me alone I could be sorry in my own way
but I dont see why I have to make a parade of grief It seems toto
cheapen ones feelings you know

He nodded Just as if you had to measure your friendship for the dead
with a yardstick of Mother Grundy Its a hideous imposition laid on us
by custom one of Ibsens ghosts

Its so good to hear you say that And do you think I may begin to be
happy again

I think it would be allowable to start with one smile a day say and
gradually increase the dose he jested In the course of a week if
it seems to agree with you try a laugh

She made the experiment without waiting the week amused at his
whimsical way of putting it Nevertheless the sound of her own
laughter gave her a little shock

You came on business I suppose she said presently

Yes I came to raise a million dollars for some improvements I want to
make

Let me lend it to you she proposed eagerly

That would be a good one Im going to use it to fight the
Consolidated Since you are now its chief stockholder you would be
letting me have money with which to fight you

I shouldnt care about that I hope you beat me

Youre my enemy now Thats not the way to talk His eyes twinkled
merrily

Am I your enemy Lets be friendly enemies then And theres
something I want to talk to you about Before he died Mr Harley told
me he had made you an offer I didnt understand the details but you
were to be in charge of all the coppermines in the country Wasnt
that it

Something of that sort I declined the proposition

I want you to take it now and manage everything for me I dont know
Mr Harleys associates but I can trust you You can arrange it any
way you like but I want to feel that you have the responsibility

He saw again that vision of powerall the copper interests of the
country pooled with himself at the head of the combination He knew it
would not be so easy to arrange as she thought for though she had
inherited Harleys wealth she had not taken over his prestige and
force There would be other candidates for leadership But if he
managed her campaign Alines great wealth must turn the scale in their
favor

You must think this over again You must talk it over with your
advisers before we come to a decision he said gravely

Ive told Mr Jarmyn He says the idea is utterly impossible But
well show him wont we Its my money and my stock not his I dont
see why he should dictate Hes always My dear ladying me I wont
have it she pouted

The fighting gleam was in Ridgways eyes now So Mr Jannyn thinks it
is impossible does he

Thats what he said He thinks you wouldnt do at all

If you really mean it well show him about that

She shook hands with him on it

Youre very good to me she said so naively that he could not keep
back his smile

Most people would say I was very good to myself What you offer me is
a thing I might have fought for all my life and never won

Then Im glad if it pleases you Thats enough about business Now
well talk about something important

He could think of only one thing more important to him than this but
it appeared she meant plans to see as much as possible of him while he
was in the city

I suppose you have any number of other friends here that will want
you she said

They cant have me if this friend wants me he answered with that
deep glow in his eyes she recognized from of old and before she could
summon her reserves of defense he asked Do you want me Aline

His meaning came to her with a kind of sweet shame No no nonot
yet she cried

Dear he answered taking her little hand in his big one only this
now that I cant help wanting to be near you to comfort you because I
love you For everything else I am content to wait

And I love you the girlwidow answered a flush dyeing her cheeks
But I ought not to tell you yet ought I

There was that in her radiant teardewed eyes that stirred the deepest
stores of tenderness in the man His finer instincts vandal and pagan
though he was responded to it

It is right that you should tell me since it is true but it is
right too that we should wait

It is sweet to know that you love me There are so many things I dont
understand You must help me You are so strong and so sure and I am
so helpless

You dear innocent so strong in your weakness he murmured to himself

You must be a guide to me and a teacher

And you a conscience to me he smiled not without amusement at the
thought

She took it seriously But Im afraid I cant You know so much better
than I do what is right

Im quite a paragon of virtue he confessed

Youre so sure of everything You took it for granted that I loved
you Why were you so sure

I was just as sure as you were that I cared for you Confess

She whispered it Yes I knew it but when you did not come I thought
perhaps You see Im not strong or clever I cant help you as
Virginia could She stopped the color washing from her face I had
forgotten You have no right to love menor I you she faltered

Girl o mine we have every right in the world Love is never wrong
unless it is a theft or a robbery There is nothing between me and
Virginia that is not artificial and conventional no tie that ought not
to be broken none that should ever of right have existed Love has the
right of way before mere convention a hundredfold

Ah If I were sure

But I was to be a teacher to you and a judge for you

And I was to be a conscience to you

But on this I am quite clear I can be a conscience to myself
However there is no hurry Times a great solvent

And we can go on loving each other in the meantime

He lifted her little pink fingers and kissed them Yes we can do that
all the time



CHAPTER 26 BREAKS ONE AND MAKES ANOTHER ENGAGEMENT

Miss Balfours glass made her irritably aware of cheeks unduly flushed
and eyes unusually bright Since she prided herself on being sufficient
for the emergencies of life she cast about in her mind to determine
which of the interviews that lay before her was responsible for her
excitement It was to be sure an unusual experience for a young woman
to be told that her fiance would be unable to marry her owing to a
subsequent engagement but she looked forward to it with keen
anticipation and would not have missed it for the world Since she
pushed the thought of the other interview into the background of her
mind and refused to contemplate it at all she did not see how that
could lend any impetus to her pulse

But though she was pleasantly excited as she swept into the
receptionroom Ridgway was unable to detect the fact in her cool
little nod and frank careless handshake Indeed she looked so
entirely mistress of herself so much the perfectly gowned exquisite
that he began to dread anew the task he had set himself It is not a
pleasant thing under the most favorable circumstances to beg off from
marrying a young woman one has engaged oneself to and Ridgway did not
find it easier because the young woman looked every inch a queen and
was so manifestly far from suspecting the object of his call

I havent had a chance to congratulate you personally yet she said
after they had drifted to chairs Ive been immensely proud of you

I got your note It was good of you to write as soon as you heard

She swept him with one of her smilelit side glances Though of
course in a way I was felicitating myself when I congratulated you

You mean

She laughed with velvet maliciousness Oh well Im dragged into the
orbit of your greatness am I not As the wife of the president of the
Greater Consolidated Copper Companythe immense combine that takes in
practically all the larger copper properties in the countryI should
come in for a share of reflected glory you know

Ridgway bit his lip and took a deep breath but before he had found
words she was off again She had no intention of letting him descent
from the rack yet

How did you do it By what magic did you bring it about Of course
Ive read the newspapers accounts seen your features and your history
butchered in a dozen Sunday horrors and thanked Heaven no enterprising
reporter guessed enough to use me as copy Every paper I have picked up
for weeks has been full of you and the story of how you took Wall
Street by the throat But I suspect they were all guesses merely
superficial rumors except as to the main facts What I want to know is
the inside storythe lever by means of which you pried open the door
leading to the inner circle of financial magnates You have often told
me how tightly barred that door is What was the opensesame you used
as a countersign to make the keeper of the gate unbolt

He thought he saw his chance The countersign was Aline Harley he
said and looked her straight in the face He wished he could find some
way of telling her without making him feel so like a cad

She clapped her hands I thought so She backed you with that
uncounted fortune her husband left her Is that it

That is it exactly She gave me a free hand and the immense fortune
she inherited from Harley put me in a position to force recognition
from the leaders After that it was only a question of time till I had
convinced them my plan was good He threw back his shoulders and tried
to take the fence again Would you like to know why Mrs Harley put
her fortune at my command

I suppose because she is interested in us and our little affair
Doesnt all the world love a lover she asked with a disarming candor

She had a better reason he said meeting her eyes gravely

You must tell me itbut not just yet I have something to tell you
first She held out her little clenched hand Here is something that
belongs to you Can you open it

He straightened her fingers one by one and took from her palm the
engagementring he had given her Instantly he looked up doubt and
relief sweeping his face

Am I to understand that you terminate our engagement

She nodded

May I ask why

I couldnt bring myself to it Waring I honestly tried but I
couldnt do it

When did you find this out

I began to find it out the first day of our engagement I couldnt
make it seem right Ive been in a process of learning it ever since
It wouldnt be fair to you for me to marry you

Youre a brick Virginia he cried jubilantly

No Im not That is a minor reason The really important one is that
it wouldnt be fair to me

No it would not he admitted with an air of candor

Because you see I happen to care for another man she purred

His vanity leaped up fully armed Another man Who

Thats my secret she answered smiling at his chagrin

And his

I said mine At any rate if three knew it wouldnt be a secret was
her quick retort

Do you think you have been quite fair to me Virginia he asked with
gloomy dignity

I think so she answered and touched him with the riposte Im
ready now to have you tell me when you expect to marry Aline Harley

His dignity collapsed like a pricked bladder How did you know he
demanded in astonishment

Oh well I have eyes

But I didnt knowI thought

Oh you thought You are a pair of children at the game this
thousandyearold young woman scoffed I have known for months that
you worshiped each other

If you mean to imply he began severely

Hit somebody of your size Warry she interrupted cheerfully as to
an infant If you suppose I am so guileless as not to know that you
were coming here this afternoon to tell me you were regretfully
compelled to give me up on account of a more important engagement then
you conspicuously fail to guess right I read it in your note

He gave up attempting to reprove her It did not seem feasible under
the circumstances Instead he held out the hand of peace and she took
it with a laugh of gay camaraderie

Well he smiled it seems possible that we may both soon be subjects
for congratulation That just shows how things work around right We
never would have suited each other you know

Im quite sure we shouldnt agreed Virginia promptly But I dont
think Ill trouble you to congratulate me till you see me wearing
another solitaire

Well hope for the best he said cheerfully If it is the man I
think he is a better man than I am

Yes he is she nodded without the least hesitation

I hope you will be happy with him

Im likely to be happy without him

Not unless he is a fool

Or prefers another lady as you do

She settled herself back in the low easy chair with her hands clasped
behind her head

And now Id like to know why you prefer her to me she demanded
saucily Do you think her handsomer

He looked her over from the rippling brown hair to the trim suede
shoes No he smiled they dont make them handsomer

More intellectual

No

Of a better disposition

I like yours too

More charming

I find her so saving your presence

Please justify yourself in detail

He shook his head still smiling My justification is not to be
itemized It lies deeperin destiny or fate or whatever one calls
it

I see She offered Markhams verses as an explanation

 Perhaps we are led and our loves are fated
 And our steps are counted one by one
 Perhaps we shall meet and our souls be mated
 After the burntout sun


I like that Who did you say wrote it

The immobile butler as once before presented a card for her
inspection Ridgway with recollections of the previous occasion
ventured to murmur again The fairy prince

Virginia blushed to her hair and this time did not offer the card for
his disapproval

Shall I congratulate him he wanted to know

The imperious blood came to her cheeks on the instant The sudden storm
in her eyes warned him better than words

Ill be good he murmured as Lyndon Hobart came into the room

His goodness took the form of a speedy departure She followed him to
the door for a parting fling at him

In your automobile you may reach a telegraphoffice in about five
minutes With luck you may be engaged inside of an hour

You have the advantage of me by fiftyfive minutes he flung back

You ought to thank me on your knees for having saved you a wretched
scene this afternoon was the best she could say to cover her
discomfiture

I do I do My thanks are taking the form of leaving you with the
prince

Thats very crude sirand Im not sure it isnt impertinent

Miss Balfour was blushing when she returned to Hobart He mistook the
reason and she could not very well explain that her blushes were due
to the last wordless retort of the retiring old love whose hand had
gone up in a ridiculous blessyoumychildren attitude just before he
left her

Their conversation started stiffly He had come he explained to say
goodby He was leaving the State to go to Washington prior to the
opening of the session

This gave her a chance to congratulate him upon his election I
havent had an opportunity before Youve been so busy of course
preparing to save the country that your time must have been very fully
occupied

He did not show his surprise at this interpretation of the fact that he
had quietly desisted from his attentions to her but accepted it as the
correct explanation since she had chosen to offer it

Miss Balfour expressed regret that he was going though she did not
suppose she would see any less of him than she had during the past two
months He did not take advantage of her little flings to make the talk
less formal and Virginia provoked at his aloofness offered no more
chances Things went very badly indeed for ten minutes at the end of
which time Hobart rose to go Virginia was miserably aware of being
wretched despite the cool hauteur of her seeming indifference But he
was too good a sportsman to go without letting her know he held no
grudge

I hope you will be very happy with Mr Ridgway Believe me there is
nobody whose happiness I would so rejoice at as yours

Thank you she smiled coolly and her heart raced May I hope that
your good wishes still obtain even though I must seek my happiness
apart from Mr Ridgway

He held her for an instants grave astonished questioning before
which her eyes fell Her thoughts sidetracked swiftly to long for and
to dread what was coming

Am I being toldyou must pardon me if I have misunderstood your
meaningthat you are no longer engaged to Mr Ridgway

She made obvious the absence of the solitaire she had worn

Before the long scrutiny of his steady gaze her eyes at last fell

If you dont mind Ill postpone going just yet he said quietly

Her racing heart assured her fearfully delightfully that she did not
mind at all

I have no time and no compass to take my bearings You will pardon me
if what I say seems presumptuous

Silence which is not always golden oppressed her Why could she not
make light talk as she had been wont to do with Waring Ridgway

But if I ask too much I shall not be hurt if you deny me he
continued For how long has your engagement with Mr Ridgway been
broken may I ask

Between fifteen and twenty minutes

A lovers quarrel perhaps he hazarded gently

On the contrary quite final and irrevocable Mr Ridgway and I have
never been lovers She was not sure whether this last was meant as a
confession or a justification

Not lovers He waited for her to explain Her proud eyes faced him
We became engaged for other reasons I thought that did not matter
But I find my other reasons were not sufficient Today I terminated
the engagement But it is only fair to say that Mr Ridgway had come
here for that purpose I merely anticipated him Her selfcontempt
would not let her abate one jot of the humiliating truth She flayed
herself with a whip of scorn quite lost on Hobart

A wave of surging hope was flushing his heart but he held himself well
in hand

I must be presumptuous still he said I must find out if you broke
the engagement because you care for another man

She tried to meet his shining eyes and could not You have no right to
ask that

Perhaps not till I have asked something else I wonder if I should
have any chance if I were to tell you that I love you

Her glance swept him shyly with a delicious little laugh You never
can tell till you try
