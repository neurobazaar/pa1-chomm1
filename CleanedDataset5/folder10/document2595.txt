Chapter I

 When Johnnie comes marching home again
 Hurrah Hurrah
 Well give him a hearty welcome then
 Hurrah Hurrah
 The men with the cheers the boys with shouts
 The ladies they will all turn out
 And well all feel gay when Johnnie comes marching home again

The old man and the little boy his grandson sat together in the shade
of the big walnut tree in the front yard watching the Decoration
Day Parade as it passed up the long street and when the last of the
veterans was out of sight the grandfather murmured the words of the tune
that came drifting back from the now distant band at the head of the
procession

Yes well all feel gay when Johnnie comes marching home again he
finished with a musing chuckle

Did you Grandpa the boy asked

Did I what

Did you all feel gay when the army got home

It didnt get home all at once precisely the grandfather explained
When the war was over I suppose we felt relieved more than anything
else

You didnt feel so gay when the war _was_ though I guess the boy
ventured

I guess we didnt

Were you scared Grandpa Were you ever scared the Rebels would win

No We werent ever afraid of that

Not any at all

No Not any at all

Well werent you ever scared yourself Grandpa I mean when you were
in a battle

Oh yes _then_ I was The old man laughed Scared plenty

I dont see why the boy said promptly I wouldnt be scared in a
battle

Wouldnt you

Course not Grandpa why dont you march in the Decoration Day Parade
Wouldnt they let you

Im not able to march any more Too short of breath and too shaky in
the legs and too blind

I wouldnt care said the boy Id be in the parade anyway if I was
you They had some sittin in carriages way at the tail end but I
wouldnt like that If Id been in your place Grandpa and theyd let
me be in that parade Id been right up by the band Look Grandpa
Watch me Grandpa This is the way Id be Grandpa

He rose from the garden bench where they sat and gave a complex
imitation of what had most appealed to him as the grandeurs of the
procession his prancing legs simulating those of the horse of the grand
marshal while his upper parts rendered the drums and bugles of the
band as well as the officers and privates of the militia company which
had been a feature of the parade The only thing he left out was the
detachment of veterans

Puttyboom Puttyboom Puttyboomboomboom he vociferated as the
drumsand then as the bugles Ta ta ra tara He addressed his
restive legs _Whoa_ there you Whitey Gee Haw Git up Then
waving an imaginary sword Collumn right Farwud _March_ Halt Carry
_harms_ He carried arms Showdler _harms_ He shouldered arms
and returned to his seat

Thatd be me Grandpa Thats the way Id do And as the grandfather
nodded seeming to agree a thought recently dismissed returned to the
mind of the composite procession and he asked

Well _why_ werent you ever afraid the Rebels would whip the Unions
Grandpa

Oh we knew they couldnt

I guess so The little boy laughed disdainfully thinking his question
satisfactorily answered I guess those ole Rebels couldnt whipped a
flea They didnt know how to fight any at all did they Grandpa

Oh yes they did

What The boy was astounded Werent they all just reglar ole
cowards Grandpa

No said the grandfather They were pretty fine soldiers

They were Well they ran away whenever you began shootin at em
didnt they

Sometimes they did but most times they didnt Sometimes they fought
like wildcatsand sometimes we were the ones that ran away

What for

To keep from getting killed or maybe to keep from getting captured

But the Rebels were bad men werent they Grandpa

No

The boys forehead customarily vacant showed some little vertical
shadows produced by a struggle to think Well but he began
slowly Listen Grandpa listen here

Well

Listen Well you saidyou said you never got scared the ole Rebels
were goin to win

They did win pretty often said the grandfather They won a good many
battles

I mean you said you never got scared theyd win the war

No we were never afraid of that

Well but if they were good men and fought like wildcats Grandpa and
kep winning battles and everything how could that be How could you
_help_ bein scared theyd win the war

The grandfathers feeble eyes twinkled brightly Why we _knew_ they
couldnt Ramsey

At this the little vertical shadows on Ramseys forehead became more
pronounced for he had succeeded in thinking Well _they_ didnt know
they couldnt did they he argued They thought they were goin to
win didnt they

Yes I guess they did Up till toward the last I suppose they probably
did But you see they were wrong

Well but Ramsey struggled Listen Listen here Grandpa Well
anyway if they never got scared _wed_ win and nobody got scared
_theyd_ winwell I dont see

You dont see what

But Ramsey found himself unable to continue his concentration he
slumped down upon the small of his back and his brow relaxed to its
more comfortable placidity while his eyes wandered with a new butterfly
fluttering over the irises that bordered the iron picket fence at the
south side of the yard Oh nothin much he murmured

I see And his grandfather laughed again You mean If the Rebels
felt just as sure of winning the war as we did and kept winning battles
why shouldnt we ever have had any doubts that we were going to win
Thats it isnt it

I guess so Grandpa

Well I think it was mostly because we were certain that we were
right

I see said Ramsey The Rebels knew they were on the side of the
Devil But at this the grandfathers laugh was louder than it had been
before and Ramsey looked hurt Well you can laugh if you want to he
objected in an aggrieved voice Anyway the Sundayschool supintendent
told us when people knew they were on the Devils side they always

I dare say I dare say the old man interrupted a little impatiently
But in this world mighty few people think theyre on the Devils side
Ramsey There was a Frenchman once in olden times he said people were
crazy because though they couldnt even make worms they believed they
could make gods And so whenever countries or parts of a country get
into a war each side makes a god and a devil and says Gods on our
side and the Devils on the other The South thought the Devil was on
our side you see

Well that kind o mixes it all up moren ever

Yes it seems so but Abraham Lincoln wasnt mixed up about it When
some people told him that God was on our side he said the important
thing was to find out if we were on Gods side That was the whole
question you see because either side could make up a god the kind of
a god they liked and wanted and then theyd believe in him too and
fight for himbut if he was only a madeup god theyd lose President
Lincoln didnt want to have a madeup god on his side he wanted to find
God Himself and find out what he wanted and then do it And thats what
Lincoln did

Well I dont understand much of all _that_

No Then suppose you look at it this way The South was fighting
for what it believed to be its rights but we werent fighting for our
rights we were fighting for the right The South was fighting for
what it believed to be its right to split the Union and be a country by
itself but we were fighting for Liberty and Union now and forever
one and inseparable It wasnt only the Union we fought for it was
Freedom The South wanted freedom to leave the Union but the reason the
South wanted that freedom to separate from us was because _we_ wanted
the Freedom of Man _Theres_ the reason we had the certain knowledge
that we were going to win the war How plain and simple it is

Ramsey didnt think so He had begun to feel bored by the conversation
and to undergo the oppression he usually suffered in school yet he took
a little interest in the inexplicable increase of fervour with which his
grandfather spoke and in a shoot of sunshine which somehow got through
the foliage of the walnut tree and made a bedazzlement of glinting fine
lines in one spot about the size of a saucer upon the old mans head
of thick white hair Half closing his eyes drowsily Ramsey played that
this sunshine spot was a white birdsnest and and he had a momentary
half dream of a glittering little bird that dwelt there and wore a blue
soldier cap on its head The earnest old voice of the veteran was only a
sound in the boys ears

Yes its simple and plain enough now though then we didnt often
think of it in exactly this way but just went on fighting and
never doubted We knew the struggle and suffering of our fathers and
grandfathers to make a great country here for Freedom and we knew that
all this wasnt just the whim of a foolish god willing to waste such
great thingswe knew that such a country couldnt have been building up
just to be wasted But more than that we knew that armies fighting
for the Freedom of Man _had_ to win in the long run over armies that
fought for what they considered their rights

We didnt set out to free the slaves so far as we knew Yet our being
against slavery was what made the war and we had the consciousness
that we were on the side of Gods plan because His plan is clearly the
Freedom of Man Long ago we began to see the hints of His plana little
like the way you can see whats coming in August from what happens in
April but man has to win his freedom from himselfmen in the light
have to fight against men in the dark of their own shadow That light is
the answer we had the light that made us never doubt Ours was the true
light and so we


Boom The veterans had begun to fire their cannon on the crest of
the low hill out at the cemetery and from a little way down the street
came the ratatat of a toy drum and sounds of a fife played execrably
A file of children in cocked hats made of newspapers came marching
importantly up the sidewalk under the maple shade trees and in advance
upon a velocipede rode a tinsworded personage shrieking incessant
commands but not concerning himself with whether or not any military
obedience was thereby obtained Here was a revivifying effect upon young
Ramsey his sluggard eyelids opened electrically he leaped to his feet
and abandoning his grandfather without preface or apology sped across
the lawn and out of the gate charging headlong upon the commander of
the company

You get off that locipede Wesley Bender he bellowed You gimme
that sword What rights you got to go bein captain o my army Id like
to know Who got up this army in the first place Id like to know I
did myself yesterdy afternoon and you get back in line or I wont let
you blong to it at all

The pretender succumbed he instantly dismounted being outshouted and
overawed On foot he took his place in the ranks while Ramsey became
sternly vociferous Intention company Farwud _march_ Collumn
_right_ Rightshowdler _harms_ Halt Farwud _march_ Carry harms

The Army went trudging away under the continuous but unheeded fire of
orders and presently disappeared round a corner leaving the veteran
chuckling feebly under his walnut tree and alone with the empty street
All trace of what he had said seemed to have been wiped from the
grandsons mind but memory has curious ways Ramsey had understood
not a fifth nor a tenth of his grandfathers talk and already he had
forgotten all of ityet not only were there many many times in the
boys later life when without ascertainable cause he would remember
the sunlight falling upon the old mans white head to make that
semblance of a glittering birdsnest there but with the picture came
recollections of words and sentences spoken by the grandfather though
the listener halfdrowsily had heard but the sound of an old
earnest voiceand even the veterans meaning finally took on a greater
definiteness till it became in the grandsons thoughts something clear
and bright and beautiful that he knew without being just sure where or
how he had learned it





Chapter II

Ramsey Milholland sat miserably in school his conscious being
consisting principally of a dull hate Torpor was a little dispersed
during a fifteenminute interval of Music when he and all the other
pupils in the large room of the Five B Grade sang repeated fractions
of what they enunciated as The Star Spanguhhulled Banner but
afterward he relapsed into the low spirits and animosity natural to
anybody during enforced confinement under instruction No alleviation
was accomplished by an invaders temporary usurpation of the teachers
platform a brisk and unsympathetically cheerful young woman mounting
thereon to teach German

For a long time mathematics and German had been about equally repulsive
to Ramsey who found himself daily in the compulsory presence of both
but he was gradually coming to regard German with the greater horror
because after months of patient mental resistance he at last began to
comprehend that the German language has sixteen special and particular
ways of using the German article corresponding to that flexible bit of a
word so easily managed English_the_ What in the world was the use of
having sixteen ways of doing a thing that could just as well be done in
one If the Germans had contented themselves with insisting upon sixteen
useless variations for infrequent words such as _hippopotamus_ for
instance Ramsey might have thought the affair unreasonable but not
necessarily viciousit would be easy enough to avoid talking about
a hippopotamus if he ever had to go to Germany But the fact that the
Germans picked out _a_ and _the_ and many other little words in use all
the time and gave every one of them sixteen forms and expected Ramsey
Milholland to learn this dizzying uselessness down to the last crotchety
detail with When to employ Which as a nausea to prepare for the
final convulsion when one _didnt_ use Which because it was an
Exceptionthere was a fashion of making easy matters hard that was
merely hellish

The teacher was strict but enthusiastic she told the children over and
over that German was a beautiful language and her face always had a
glow when she said this At such times the children looked patient they
supposed it must be so because she was an adult and their teacher and
they believed her with the same manner of believing which those of them
who went to Sundayschool used there when the Sundayschool teachers
were pushed into explanations of various matters set forth in the Old
Testament or gave reckless descriptions of heaven That is to say the
children did not challenge or deny already they had been driven into
habits of resignation and were passing out of the age when childhood is
able to reject adult nonsense

Thus to Ramsey Milholland the German language seemed to be a
collection of perverse inventions for undeserved torment it was full of
revolting surprises in the way of genders vocally it often necessitated
the employment of noises suggestive of an incompletely mastered
knowledge of etiquette and far inside him there was something faintly
but constantly antagonistic to ityet when the teacher declared that
German was incomparably the most beautiful language in the world one of
the many facets of his mind submissively absorbed the statement as light
to be passed inward it was part of the lesson to be learned He did not
know whether the English language was beautiful or not he never thought
about that and no one ever said anything to him about it Moreover
though his deeper inward hated German he liked his German teacher
and it was pleasant to look at her when that glow came upon her face

Sometimes too there were moments of relaxation in her class when
she would stop the lesson and tell the children about Germany what a
beautiful good country it was so trim and orderly with such pleasant
customs and all the people sensible and energetic and healthy There
was Music again in the German class which was another alleviation
though it was the same old Star Spangled Banner over again Ramsey
was tired of the song and tired of My Country Tis of Thee they were
bores but it was amusing to sing them in German In German they sounded
sort o funny so he didnt mind this bit of the days work

Half an hour later there arrived his supreme trial of this particular
morning Arithmetic then being the order of business before the house
he was sent alone to the blackboard supposedly to make lucid the proper
reply to a fatal conundrum in decimals and under the glare and focus of
the whole room he breathed heavily and itched everywhere his brain at
once became sheer hash He consumed as much time as possible in getting
the terms of the problem stated in chalk then affecting to be critical
of his own handiwork erased what he had done and carefully wrote it
again After that he erased half of it slowly retraced the figures
and stepped back as if to see whether perspective improved their
appearance Again he lifted the eraser

Ramsey Milholland

Maam

Put down that eraser

Yesm I just thought

Sharply bidden to get forward with his task he explained in a feeble
voice that he had first to tie a shoe string and stooped to do so but
was not permitted Miss Ridgely tried to stimulate him with hints and
suggestion found him so far as decimals went mere protoplasm and
wondering how so helpless a thing could live summoned to the board
little Dora Yocum the star of the class whereupon Ramsey moved toward
his seat

Stand still Ramsey You stay right where you are and try to learn
something from the way Dora does it

The class giggled and Ramsey stood but learned nothing His
conspicuousness was unendurable because all of his schoolmates
naturally found more entertainment in watching him than in following
the performance of the capable Dora He put his hands in and out of his
pockets was bidden to hold them still also not to shuffle his feet
and when in a false assumption of ease he would have scratched his head
Miss Ridgelys severity increased so that he was compelled to give over
the attempt

Instructed to watch every figure chalked up by the mathematical wonder
his eyes grown sodden were unable to remove themselves from the part
in her hair at the back of her head where two little braids began their
separate careers to end in a couple of blueandred checked bits of
ribbon one upon each of her thin shoulder blades He was conscious that
the part in Doras shining brown hair was odious but he was unconscious
of anything arithmetical His sensations clogged his intellect he
suffered from unsought notoriety and hated Dora Yocum most of all he
hated her busy little shoulder blades

He had to be kept in after school and when he was allowed to go home
he averted his eyes as he went by the house where Dora lived She was
out in the yard eating a doughnut and he knew it but he had passed
the age when it is just as permissible to throw a rock at a girl as at a
boy and stifling his normal inclinations he walked sturdily on though
he indulged himself so far as to engage in a murmured conversation with
one of the familiar spirits dwelling somewhere within him Pfa said
Ramsey to himselfor himself to Ramsey since it is difficult to say
which was which Pfa Thinks shes smart dont she Well I guess
she does but she aint  I hate her dont you You bet
your life I hate her Teachers Pet thats what _I_ call her
Well thats what _I_ call her too dont I Well _I_ do thats
all she is anywaydirty ole Teachers Pet





Chapter III

He had not forgiven her four years later when he entered high school
in her company for somehow Ramsey managed to shovel his way through
examinations and stayed with the class By this time he had a long
accumulation of reasons for hating her Doras persistent and increasing
competency was not short of flamboyant and teachers naturally got the
habit of flinging their quickest pupil in the face of their slowest and
dumbest Nevertheless Ramsey was unable to deny that she had become
less awful lookin than she used to be At least he was honest enough
to make a partial retraction when his friend and classmate Fred
Mitchell insisted that an amelioration of Doras appearance could be
actually proven

Well Ill take it back I dont claim shes every last bit as awful
lookin as she always has been said Ramsey toward the conclusion of
the argument Ill say this for her shes awful lookin but she may
not be as awful lookin as she was She dont come to school with the
edge of some of her undercloes showin below her dress any more about
every other day and her eyewinkers have got to stickin out some and
she may not be so abbasa_loot_ly skinny but shell haf to wait a mighty
long while before _I_ want to look at her without gettin sick

The implication that Miss Yocum cared to have Ramsey look at her either
with or without gettin sick was mere rhetoric and recognized as such
by the producer of it she had never given the slightest evidence of
any desire that his gaze be bent upon her What truth lay underneath his
flourish rested upon the fact that he could not look at her without some
symptoms of the sort he had tersely sketched to his friend and yet so
pungent is the fascination of selfinflicted misery he did look at her
during periods of study often for three or four minutes at a stretch
His expression at such times indeed resembled that of one who has dined
unwisely but Dora Yocum was always too eagerly busy to notice it He
was almost never in her eye but she was continually in his moreover
as the banner pupil she was with hourly frequency an exhibit before the
whole class

Ramsey found her worst of all when her turn came in Declamation
on Friday afternoons When she ascended the platform bobbed a little
preliminary bow and began Listen my children and you shall hear
Ramsey included Paul Revere and the Old North Church and the whole
Revolutionary War in his antipathy since they somehow appeared to
be the property of the Teachers Pet For Dora held this post in
Declamation as well as in everything else here as elsewhere the
hateful childs prowess surpassed that of all others and the teacher
always entrusted her with the rendition of the patriotic selections
Dora seemed to take fire herself when she declared

 The fate of a nation was riding that night
 And the spark struck out by that steed in his flight
 Kindled the land into flame with its heat

Ramsey himself was in the same section of declaimers and performed
nexta ghastly contrast He gave a selection from Shakespeare
assigned by the teacher and he began this continuous misfortune by
stumbling violently as he ascended the platform which stimulated a
general giggle already in being at the mere calling of his name All of
the class were bright with happy anticipation for the miserable Ramsey
seldom failed their hopes particularly in Declamation He faced them
his complexion wan his expression both baleful and horrified and he
began in a loud hurried voice from which every hint of intelligence
was excluded

Most pottent grave and rev

The teacher tapped sharply on her desk and stopped him Youve
forgotten to bow she said And dont say pottent The word is
potent

Ramsey flopped his head at the rear wall of the room and began again

Most pottent potent gray and revenerd signers my very nobe and approve
good masters that I have tan away this sole mans dutter it is mose true
true I have marry dur the very headman frun tuv my fending hath this
extent no more rude am I in speechin speechrude am I in speechin
speechin speechin speech

He had stalled Perhaps the fatal truth of that phrase and some sense
of its applicability to the occasion had interfered with the mechanism
which he had set in operation to get rid of the recitation for him
At all events the machine had to run off its job all at once or it
wouldnt run at all Stopped it stayed stopped and backing off granted
no new impetus though he tried again and again Hath this extent
no more rude am I in speech He gulped audibly Rude rude rude am
Irude am I in speechin speechin speech Rude am I in speech

Yes the irritated teacher said as Ramseys failing voice continued
huskily to insist upon this point I think you are And her nerves
were a little soothed by the shout of laughter from the schoolit was
never difficult for teachers to be witty Go sit down Ramsey and do
it after school

His ears roaring the unfortunate went to his seat and among all
the hilarious faces one stood outDora Yocums Her laughter was
precocious it was that of a confirmed superior insufferably adultshe
was laughing at him as a grown person laughs at a child Conspicuously
and unmistakably there was something indulgent in her amusement He
choked Here was a little squirt of a highschool girl who would trot
up to George Washington himself and show off around him given the
opportunity and George Washington would probably pat her on the head
or give her a medalor something Well let him Ramsey didnt care
He didnt care for George Washington or Paul Revere or Shakespeare or
any of em They could all go to the dickens with Dora Yocum They were
all a lot of smarties anyway and he hated the whole stew of em

There was one however whom he somehow couldnt manage to hate even
though this one officially seemed to be as intimately associated with
Dora Yocum and superiority as the others were Ramsey couldnt hate
Abraham Lincoln even when Dora was chosen to deliver the Gettysburg
Address on the twelfth of February Vaguely yet reassuringly Ramsey
felt that Lincoln had resisted adoption by the intellectuals Lincoln
had said Government of the people by the people for the people and
that didnt mean government by the teacher and the Teachers Pet
and Paul Revere and Shakespeare and suchlike it meant government by
everybody and therefore Ramsey had as much to do with it as anybody
else had This was friendly and he believed that if Abraham Lincoln
could have walked into the schoolroom Lincoln would have been as
friendly with him as with Dora and the teacher herself Beyond a doubt
Dora and the teacher _thought_ Lincoln belonged to them and their crowd
of exclusives they seemed to think they owned the whole United States
but Ramsey was sure they were mistaken about Abraham Lincoln

He felt that it was just like this little Yocum snippet to assume such a
thing and it made him sicker than ever to look at her

Then one day he noticed that her eyewinkers were stickin out farther
and farther





Chapter IV

His discovery irritated him the more Next thing this ole Teachers Pet
would do shed get to thinkin she was pretty If _that_ happened well
nobody _could_ stand her The long lashes made her eyes shadowy and it
was a fact that her shoulder blades ceased to insist upon notoriety you
couldnt tell where they were at all any more Her back seemed to be
just a regular back not made up of a lot of implements like shoulder
blades and things

A contemptible thing happened Wesley Bender was well known to be the
most untidy boy in the class and had never shown any remorse for his
reputation or made the slightest effort either to improve or to dispute
it He was content it failed to lower his standing with his fellows
or to impress them unfavourably In fact he was treated as one who has
attained a slight distinction At least he owned one superlative no
matter what its quality and it lifted him out of the commonplace It
helped him to become better known and boys liked to be seen with him
But one day there was a rearrangement of the seating in the schoolroom
Wesley Bender was given a desk next in front of Dora Yocums and within
a week the whole room knew that Wesley had begun voluntarily to wash his
neckthe back of it anyhow

This was at the bottom of the fight between Ramsey Milholland and Wesley
Bender and the diplomatic exchanges immediately preceding hostilities
were charmingly frank and unhyprocitical although quite as mixedup
and offtheissue as if they had been prepared by professional foreign
office men Ramsey and Fred Mitchell and four other boys waylaid young
Bender on the street after school intending jocosities rather than
violence but the victim proved sensitive You take your ole hands off
o me he said fiercely as they began to push him about among them

Ole dirty Wes they hoarsely bellowed and squawked in their changing
voices Washes his ears Washes his _neck_ Dora Yocum told
his mama to turn the hose on him Yayho Ole dirty Wes tryin to be
a duke

Wesley broke from them and backed away swinging his strapped books in
a dangerous circle You keep off he warned them I got as much right
to my persnal appearance as anybody

This richly fed their humour and they rioted round him keeping outside
the swinging books at the end of the strap Persnal appearance
Who went and bought it for you Wes Nobody bought it for him
Dora Yocum took and give him one

You leave ladies names alone cried the chivalrous Wesley You ought
to know better on the public street youpups

Here was a serious affront at least to Ramsey Milhollands way
of thinking for Ramsey also now proved sensitive He quoted his
friendsShut upand advanced toward Wesley You look here Who you
callin pups

Everybody Wesley hotly returned Everybody that hasnt got any
more decency than to go around mentioning ladies names on the public
streets Everybody that goes around mentioning ladies names on the
public streets are pups

They are are they Ramsey as hotly demanded Well you just look
here a minute my own father mentions my mothers name on the public
streets whenever he wants to and you just try callin my father a pup
and you wont know what happened to you

Whatll _you_ do about it

Ill put a new head on you said Ramsey Thats what Ill do because
anybody that calls my father or mother a pup

Oh shut up I wasnt talking about your ole father and mother I said
everybody that mentioned Dora Yocums name on the public streets was
a pup and I mean it Everybody that mentions Dora Yocums name on the
pub

Dora Yocum said Ramsey I got a perfect right to say it anywhere I
want to Dora Yocum Dora Yocum Dora Yocum

All right then youre a pup

Ramsey charged upon him and received a suffocating blow full in the
face not from Mr Benders fist but from the solid bundle of books
at the end of the strap Ramsey saw eight or ten objectives instantly
there were Wesley Benders standing full length in the air on top of
other Wesley Benders and more Wesley Benders zigzagged out sideways
from still other Wesley Benders nevertheless he found one of these and
it proved to be flesh He engaged it wildly at fisticuffs pounded
it upon the countenance and drove it away Then he sat down upon the
curbstone and with his dizzy eyes shut leaned forward for the better
accommodation of his ensanguined nose

Wesley had retreated to the other side of the street holding a grimy
handkerchief to the midmost parts of his pallid face There you ole
damn pup he shouted in a voice which threatened to sob I guess
_thatll_ teach you to be careful how you mention Dora Yocums name on
the public streets

At this Ramsey made a motion as if to rise and pursue whereupon Wesley
fled wailing back over his shoulder as he ran You wait till I ketch
you out alone on the public streets and Ill

His voice was lost in an outburst of hooting from his former friends
who sympathetically surrounded the wounded Ramsey But in a measure
at least the chivalrous fugitive had won his point He was routed and
outdone yet what survived the day was a rumour which became a sort of
tenuous legend among those interested There had been a fight over Dora
Yocum it appeared and Ramsey Milholland had attempted to maintain
something derogatory to the lady while Wesley defended her as a
knightly youth should The something derogatory was left vague nobody
attempted to say just what it was and the effects of the legend divided
the schoolroom strictly according to gender

The boys unmindful of proper gallantry supported Ramsey on account of
the way he had persisted in lickin the stuffin out of Wesley Bender
after receiving that preliminary wallop from Wesleys blackjack
bundle of books The girls petted and championed Wesley they talked
outrageously of his conqueror fiercely declaring that he ought to be
arrested and for weeks they maintained a new manner toward him They
kept their facial expressions hostile but perhaps this was more for one
anothers benefit than for Ramseys and several of them went so far out
of their way to find even private opportunities for reproving him that
an alert observer might have suspected them to have been less indignant
than they seemedbut not Ramsey He thought they all hated him and
said he was glad of it

Dora was a nonpartisan The little prig was so diligent at her books
she gave never the slightest sign of comprehending that there had been
a fight about her Having no real cognizance of Messrs Bender and
Milholland except as impediments to the advance of learning she did not
even look demure





Chapter V

With Wesley Bender Ramsey was again upon fair terms before the winter
had run its course the two were neighbours and moreover were drawn
together by a community of interests which made their reconciliation a
necessity Ramsey played the guitar and Wesley played the mandolin

All ill feeling between them died with the first duet of spring yet the
twinkling they made had no charm to soothe the savage breast of Ramsey
whenever the Teachers Pet came into his thoughts He daydreamed a
thousand ways of putting her in her place but was unable to carry
out any of them and had but a cobwebby satisfaction in imagining
discomfitures for her which remained imaginary With a yearning so
poignant that it hurt he yearned and yearned to show her what she
really was Just once he said to Fred Mitchell Thats all I ask
just once Just gimme one chance to show that girl what she really is
I guess if I ever get the chance shell find out whats the matter with
her for _once_ in her life anyway Thus it came to be talked about
and understood and expected in Ramseys circle all male that Dora
Yocums day was coming The nature of the disaster was left vague but
there was no doubt in the world that retribution merely awaited its
ideal opportunity Youll see said Ramsey The timell come when
that ole girlll wish shed moved o this town before she ever got
appointed monitor of _our_ class Just you wait

They waited but conditions appeared to remain unfavourable
indefinitely Perhaps the great opportunity might have arrived if Ramsey
had been able to achieve a startling importance in any of the various
divergent yet parallel lines of school endeavourone of the phrases by
means of which teachers and principal clogged the minds of their unarmed
auditors But though he was far from being the dumb driven beast of
misfortune that he seemed in the schoolroom and in fact lived a
double life exhibiting in his outofschool hours a remarkable example
of secondary personalitya creature fearing nothing and capable
of laughter blueeyed fairly robust and anything but dumbhe was
nevertheless without endowment or attainment great enough to get him
distinction

He tried for the highschool eleven and tried for the nine but
the experts were not long in eliminating him from either of these
competitions and he had to content himself with cheering instead of
getting cheered He was by no manner of means athlete enough or enough
of anything else to put Dora Yocum in her place and so he and the
great opportunity were still waiting in May at the end of the second
year of high school when the class now the 10 A reverted to an old
fashion and decided to entertain itself with a woodland picnic

They gathered upon the sandy banks of a creek in the blue shade of big
patchybarked sycamores with a dancing sky on top of everything and
gold dust atwinkle over the water Hither the napkincovered baskets
were brought from the wagons and assembled in the shade where they
appeared as an attractive little meadow of white napery and gave both
surprise and pleasure to communities of ants and to other original
settlers of the neighbourhood

From this nucleus or headquarters of the picnic various expeditions
set forth up and down the creek and through the woods that bordered it
Camera work was constant spring wild flowers were accumulated by groups
of girls who trooped through the woods with eager eyes searching the
thickets two envied boy fishermen established themselves upon a bank
upstream with hooks and lines thoughtfully brought with them and
poles which they fashioned from young saplings They took mussels from
the shallows for bait and having gone to all this trouble declined
to share with friends less energetic and provident the perquisites and
pleasures secured to themselves

Albert Paxton was another person who proved his enterprise Having
visited the spot some days before he had hired for his exclusive use
throughout the duration of the picnic an old rowboat belonging to a
shanty squatter it was the only rowboat within a mile or two and Albert
had his own uses for it Albert was the class lover and after first
taking the three chaperon teachers out for a row an excursion
concluded in about ten minutes he disembarked them Sadie Clews stepped
into the boat a pocket camera in one hand a tennis racket in the
other and the two spent the rest of the day except for the luncheon
interval solemnly drifting along the banks or grounded on a shoal Now
and then Albert would row a few strokes and at almost any time when the
populated shore glanced toward them Sadie would be seen photographing
Albert or Albert would be seen photographing Sadie but the tennis
racket remained an enigma Oarsman and passenger appeared to have no
conversation whatevernot once was either seen or heard to address a
remark to the other and they looked as placid as their own upsidedown
reflections in one of the still pools they slowly floated over They
were sixteen and had been engaged more than two years

On the borders of the little meadow of baskets there had been deposited
two black shapes which remained undisturbed throughout the day a
closed guitar case and a closed mandolin case no doubt containing each
its proper instrument So far as any use of these went they seemed to be
of the same leisure class to which Sadies tennis racket belonged for
when one of the teachers suggested music the musicians proved shy
Wesley Bender said they hadnt learned to play anything much and
besides he had a couple o broken strings he didnt know as he could
fix up and Ramsey said he guessed it seemed kind o too hot to play
much Joining friends they organized a contest in marksmanship the
target being a floating can which they assailed with pebbles and after
that they skipped flat stones upon the surface of the water then went
to join a group gathered about Willis Parker and Heinie Krusemeyer

No fish had been caught a lack of luck crossly attributed by the
fishermen to the noise made by constant advice on the part of their
attendant gallery Messrs Milholland Bender and the other rock
throwers came up shouting and were ill received

For heavens sakes Heinie Krusemeyer demanded cant you shut up
Here we just first got the girls to keep their mouths shut a minute and
I almost had a big pickerel or something on my hook and here you got
to up and yell so he chases himself away Why cant nobody show a little
sense sometimes when they ought to

I should say so his comrade exclaimed If people would only just
take and think of all the trouble we been to it seems funny somebody
couldnt let us have half a chance to get a few good fish What chance
they got to bite with a lot o _girls_ gabbin away and then just as
we get em quieted down all you men got to come bustin up here yellin
your heads off A fish isnt goin to bite when he cant even hear
himself think Anybody ought to know that much

But the new arrivals hooted _Fish_ Ramsey vociferated Ill bet
a hundred dollars there hasnt been even a minny in this creek for the
last sixty years

There is too said Heinie bitterly But I wouldnt be surprised
there wouldnt be no longer if you got to keep up this noise If youd
shut up just a minute you could see yourself theres fish here

In whispers several of the tamed girls at once heartily corroborated
this statement whereupon the newcomers ceased to gibe and consented to
silence Ramsey leaned forth over the edge of the overhanging bank
a dirt precipice five feet above the water and peered into the
indeterminable depths below The pool had been stirred partly by the
inexpert pokings of the fishermen and partly by small clods and bits
of dirt dislodged from above by the feet of the audience The water
consequently was but brownly translucent and revealed its secrets
reluctantly nevertheless certain dim little shapes had been observed
to move within it and were still there Ramsey failed to see them at
first

Wheres any ole fish he inquired scornfully

Oh my goodness Heinie Krusemeyer moaned _Cant_ you shut up

Look whispered the girl who stood nearest to Ramsey She pointed
Theres one Right down there by Williss hook Dont you see him

Ramsey was impressed enough to whisper Is there I dont see him I
cant

The girl came closer to him and the better to show him leaned out
over the edge of the bank and for safety in maintaining her balance
rested her left hand upon his shoulder while she pointed with her right
Thereupon something happened to Ramsey The touch upon his shoulder was
almost nothing and he had never taken the slightest interest in Milla
Rust to whom that small warm hand belonged though she was the class
beauty and long established in the office Now all at once a peculiar
and heretofore entirely unfamiliar sensation suddenly became important
in the upper part of his chest For a moment he held his breath an
involuntary actionhe seemed to be standing in a shower of flowers

Dont you see it Ramsey Milla whispered Its a great big one Why
it must be as long asas your shoe Look

Ramsey saw nothing but the thick round curl on Millas shoulder Milla
had a group of curls on each of her shoulders for she got her modes at
the Movies and had that sort of prettiness large gentle calculating
eyes and a full softly modelled face implacably sweet Ramsey was
accustomed to all this charm and Milla had never before been of more
importance to him than an equal weight of school furniturebut all at
once some magic had enveloped her That curl upon the shoulder
nearest him was shot with dazzling fibres of sunshine He seemed to be
trembling

I dont see it he murmured huskily afraid that she might remove her
hand I cant see any fish Milla

She leaned farther out over the bank Why there goosie she
whispered Right there

I cant see it

She leaned still farther bending down to point Why right th

At this moment she removed her hand from his shoulder though
unwillingly She clutched at him in fact but without avail She had
been too amiable

A loud shriek was uttered by throats abler to vocalize just then than
Millas for in her great surprise she said nothing whateverthe shriek
came from the other girls as Milla left the crest of the overhanging
bank and almost horizontally disappeared into the brown water There
was a tumultuous splash and then of Milla Rust and her wellknown
beautifulness there was nothing visible in the superficial world nor
upon the surface of that creek The vanishment was total

_Save_ her

Several girls afterward admitted having used this expression and little
Miss Floy Williams the youngest and smallest member of the class was
unable to deny that she had said Oh God Nothing could have been
more natural and the matter need not have been brought before her with
such insistence and frequency during the two remaining years of her
undergraduate career

Ramsey was one of those who heard this exclamation later so famous
and perhaps it was what roused him to heroism He dived from the bank
headlong and the strange thought in his mind was I guess _this_ll
show Dora Yocum He should have been thinking of Milla of course at
such a time particularly after the little enchantment just laid upon
him by Millas touch and Millas curls and he knew well enough that
Miss Yocum was not among the spectators She was half a mile away as
it happened gathering botanical specimens with one of the
teacherswhich was her idea of what to do at a picnic

Ramsey struck the water hard and in the same instant struck something
harder Wesley Benders bundle of books had given him no such shock
as he received now and if the creek bottom had not been of mud just
there the top of his young head might have declined the strain Half
stunned choking spluttering he somehow floundered to his feet and
when he could get his eyes a little cleared of water he found himself
wavering face to face with a blurred vision of Milla Rust She had risen
up out of the pond and stood knee deep like a lovely drenched figure in
a fountain

Upon the bank above them Willis Parker was jumping up and down
gesticulating and shouting fiercely Now I guess youre satisfied our
fishin _is_ spoilt Whynt you listen me I _told_ you it wasnt moren
three feet deep I and Heinie waded all over this creek gettin our
bait Youre a pretty sight

Of Milla he spoke unwittingly the literal truth Even with her hair thus
wild and sodden Milla rose from immersion blushing and prettier than
ever and she was prettiest of all when she stretched out her hand
helplessly to Ramsey and he led her up out of the waters They had
plenty of assistance to scramble to the top of the bank and there Milla
was surrounded and borne away with a great clacketing and tumult Ramsey
gave his coat into the hands of friends who twisted the water out of
it for him while he sat upon the grass in the sun rubbed his head and
experimented with his neck to see if it would work The sunshine was
strong and hot in half an hour he and his clothes were dryor at least
dry enough as he said and except for some soreness of head and neck
and the general crumpledness of his apparel he seemed to be in all
ways much as usual when shouts and whistlings summoned all the party
to luncheon at the rendezvous The change that made him different was
invisible





Chapter VI

The change in Ramsey was invisible and yet something must have been
seen for everyone appeared to take it for granted that he was to
sit next to Milla at the pastoral meal She herself understood it
evidently for she drew in her puckered skirts and without any words
make a place for him beside her as he driftingly approached her
affecting to whistle and keeping his eyes on the foliage overhead He
still looked upward even in the act of sitting down

Squirrel or something he said feebly as if in explanation

Where Milla asked

Up there on a branch He accepted a plate from her she had provided
herself with an extra one but he did not look at it or her Im not
just exactly sure its a squirrel he said Kind of hard to make out
exactly what it is He continued to keep his eyes aloft because he
imagined that all of the class were looking at him and Milla and he
felt unable to meet such publicity It was to him as if the whole United
States had been scandalized to attention by this act of his in going
to sit beside Milla he gazed upward so long that his eyeballs became
sensitive under the strain He began to blink I cant make out whether
its a squirrel or just some leaves that kind o got fixed like one
he said I cant make out yet which it is but I guess when theres a
breeze if its a squirrel hell probly hop around some then if hes
alive or anything

It had begun to seem that his eyes must remain fixed in that upward
stare forever he wanted to bring them down but could not face the
glare of the world So the fugitive ostrich is said to bury his head in
the sand he does it not believing himself thereby hidden but trying to
banish from his own cognizance terrible facts which his unsheltered eyes
have seemed to reveal So too do nervous children seek to bury their
eyes under pillows and nervous statesmen theirs under oratory Ramseys
ostrichings can happen to anybody But finally the brightness of the sky
between the leaves settled matters for him he sneezed wept and for
a little moment again faced his fellowmen No one was looking at him
everybody except Milla had other things to do

Having sneezed involuntarily he added a spell of coughing for which
there was no necessity I guess I must be wrong he muttered thickly

What about Ramsey

About it bein a squirrel With infinite timidity he turned his head
and encountered a gaze so soft so hallowed that it disconcerted him
and he dropped a drumstick of fried chicken well dotted with ants
from his plate Scarlet he picked it up but did not eat it For the
first time in his life he felt that eating fried chicken held in the
fingers was not to be thought of He replaced the drumstick upon his
plate and allowed it to remain there untouched in spite of a great
hunger for it

Having looked down he now found difficulty in looking up but gazed
steadily at his plate and into this limited circle of vision came
Millas delicate and rosy fingers bearing a gift There she said in
a motherly little voice Its a tomato mayonnaise sandwich and I made
it myself I want you to eat it Ramsey

His own fingers approached tremulousness as he accepted the thick
sandwich from her and conveyed it to his mouth A moment later his soul
filled with horror for a spurt of mayonnaise dressing had caused a
catastrophe the scene of which occupied no inconsiderable area of his
right cheek which was the cheek toward Milla He groped wretchedly for
his handkerchief but could not find it he had lost it Sudden death
would have been relief he was sure that after such grotesquerie Milla
could never bear to have anything more to do with him he was ruined

In his anguish he felt a paper napkin pressed gently into his hand a
soft voice said in his ear Wipe it off with this Ramsey Nobodys
noticing

So this incredibly charitable creature was still able to be his friend
even after seeing him mayonnaised Humbly marvelling he did as she told
him but avoided all further risks He ate nothing more

He sighed his first sigh of inexpressibleness had a chill or so along
the spine and at intervals his brow was bedewed

Within his averted eyes there dwelt not the Milla Rust who sat beside
him but an iridescent fragile creature who had become angelic

He spent the rest of the day dawdling helplessly about her wherever she
went he was near as near as possible but of no deliberate volition of
his own Something seemed to tie him to her and Milla was nothing loth
He seldom looked at her directly or for longer than an instant and
more rarely still did he speak to her except as a reply What few
remarks he ventured upon his own initiative nearly all concerned the
landscape which he commended repeatedly in a weak voice as kind of
pretty though once he said he guessed there might be bugs in the bark
of a log on which they sat and he became so immoderately personal as to
declare that if the bugs had to get on anybody hed rather they got on
him than on Milla She said that was just perfectly lovely of him
asked where he got his sweet nature and in other ways encouraged him to
continue the revelation but Ramsey was unable to get forward with it
though he opened and closed his mouth a great many times in the effort
to do so

At five oclock everybody was summoned again to the rendezvous for a
ceremony preliminary to departure the class found itself in a large
circle standing and sang The Star Spangled Banner Ordinarily on
such an openair and outofschool occasion Ramsey would have joined
the chorus uproariously with the utmost blatancy of which his vocal
apparatus was capable and most of the other boys expressed their humour
by drowning out the serious efforts of the girls but he sang feebly
not much more than humming through his teeth Standing beside Milla
he was incapable of his former inelegancies and his voice was in a
semiparalyzed condition like the rest of him


Opposite him across the circle Dora Yocum stood a little in advance of
those near her for of course she led the singing Her clear and earnest
voice was distinguishable from all others and though she did not
glance toward Ramsey he had a queer feeling that she was assuming more
superiority than ever and that she was icily scornful of him and Milla
The old resentment rosehed show that girl yet some day

When the song was over cheers were given for the class the good
ole class of Nineteen Fourteen the school the teachers and for the
picnic thus officially concluded and then the picnickers carrying
their baskets and faded wild flowers and other souvenirs and burdens
moved toward the big express wagons which were to take them back into
the town Ramsey got his guitar case and turned to Milla

Well he said

Well what Ramsey

Wellgbye

Why no said Milla Anyways not yet You can go back in the same
wagon with me Its going to stop at the school and let us out there
and then you could walk home with me if you felt like it You could come
all the way to our gate with me I expect unless youd be late home for
your supper

Wellwell Id be perfectly willing Ramsey said Only I heard we
all had to go back in whatever wagon we came out in and I didnt come
in the same wagon with you so

Milla laughed and leaned toward him a little I already tended to
that she said confidentially I asked Johnnie Fiske that came out in
my wagon to go back in yours so that makes room for you

Wellthen I guess I could do it He moved toward the wagon with her
I expect it dont make much difference one way or the other

And you can carry my basket if you want to she said adding
solicitously Unless its too heavy when you already got your guitar
case to carry Ramsey

This thoughtfulness of hers almost overcame him she seemed divine
He gulped and emotion made him even pinker than he had been under the
mayonnaise

IIll be glad to carry the basket too he faltered Itit dont
weigh anything much

Well lets hurry sos we can get places together

Then as she manoeuvred him through the little crowd about the wagon
with a soft push this way and a gentle pull that and hurried him up the
improvised steps and found a place where there was room for them to sit
Ramsey had another breathless sensation heretofore unknown to him
He found himself taken under a dovelike protectorship a wonderful
inexpressible Being seemed to have become his proprietor

Isnt this just perfectly lovely she said cozily close to his ear

He swallowed but found no words for he had no thoughts he was only an
incoherent tumult This was his first love

Isnt it Ramsey she urged The cozy voice had just the hint of a
reproach Dont you think its just perfectly lovely Ramsey

Yesm





Chapter VII

The next morning Ramsey came into his fathers room while Mr Milholland
was shaving an hour before church time and it became apparent that the
son had someting on his mind though for a while he said nothing

Did you want anything Ramsey

Well

Didnt want to borrow my razors

No sir

Mr Milholland chuckled I hardly supposed so seriously Shaving is
a great nuisance and the longer you keep away from it the better And
when you do you let my razors alone young feller

Yes sir Mr Milhollands razors were safe Ramsey had already
achieved one of his own but he practised the art in secret He passed
his hand thoughtfully over his cheeks and traces of white powder were
left upon his fingers whereupon he wiped his hand surreptitiously and
stood irresolutely waiting

What is it you really want Ramsey

I guess I dont want anything

Money

No sir You gay me some Friday

Mr Milholland turned from his mirror and looked over the edge of a
towel at his son In the boys eyes there was such a dumb agony of
interrogation that the father was a little startled

Why what is it Ramsey Have you He paused frowning and wondering
You havent been getting into some mess you want to tell me about have
you

No sir

His tone was meek but a mute distress lurked within it bringing to the
fathers mind disturbing suspicions and foreshadowings of indignation
and of pity See here Ramsey he said if theres anything you want
to ask me or to tell me youd better out with it and get it over Now
what is it

Wellit isnt anything

Are you _sure_

Ramseys eyes fell before the severe and piercing gaze of his father
Yes sir

Mr Milholland shook his head doubtfully then as his son walked slowly
out of the room he turned to complete his toilet in a somewhat uneasy
frame of mind Ramsey had undoubtedly wanted to say something to him and
the boys expression had shown that the matter in question was serious
distressing and it might be even critical

In fact it wasto Ramsey Having begun within only the last few hours
to regard haberdashery as of vital importance and believing his father
to be possessed of the experience and authority lacking in himself
Ramsey had come to get him to settle a question which had been upsetting
him badly in his own room since breakfast What he wanted to know was
Whether it was right to wear an extra handkerchief showing out of the
coat breast pocket or not and if it was rightought the handkerchief
to have a coloured border or to be plain white But he had never before
brought any such perplexities to his father and found himself too
diffident to set them forth

However when he left the house a few minutes later he boldly showed
an inch of purple border above the pocket then as he was himself about
to encounter several old lady pedestrians he blushed and thrust the
handkerchief down into deep concealment Having gone a block farther he
pulled it up again and so continued to operate this badge of fashion
or unfashion throughout the morning and suffered a great deal thereby

Meantime his father rather relieved that Ramsey had not told his
secret whatever it was dismissed the episode from his mind and joined
Mrs Milholland at the front door ready for church

Wheres Ramsey he asked

Hes gone ahead she answered buttoning her gloves as they went
along I heard the door quite a little while ago Perhaps he went over
to walk down with Charlotte and Vance Did you notice how neat he looks
this morning

Why no I didnt not particularly Does he

I never saw anything like it before said Mrs Milholland He went
down in the cellar and polished his own shoes

What

For about an hour I think she said as one remaining calm before a
miracle And he only has three neckties but I saw him several times in
each of them He must have kept changing and changing I wonder She
paused

Im glad hes begun to take a little care of his appearance at last
Business men think a good deal about that these days when he comes to
make his start in the world Ill have to take a look at him and give
him a word of praise I suppose hell be in the pew when we get there

But Ramsey wasnt in the pew and Charlotte his sister and her
husband who were there said they hadnt seen anything of him It was
not until the members of the family were on their way home after the
services that they caught a glimpse of him

They were passing a church a little distance from their own here the
congregation was just emerging to the open and among the sedate throng
descending the broad stone steps appeared an accompanied Ramseyand a
red red Ramsey he was when he beheld his father and mother and sister
and brotherinlaw staring up at him from the pavement below They were
kind enough not to come to an absolute halt but passed slowly on so
that he was just able to avoid parading up the street in front of
them The expressions of his father mother and sister were of a
dumfoundedness painful to bear while such lurking jocosity as that
apparent all over his brotherinlaw no dignified man should either
exhibit or be called upon to ignore

In hoarse whispers Mrs Milholland chided her husband for an
exclamation he had uttered John On Sunday You ought to be ashamed

I couldnt help it he exclaimed Who on earth is his clinging vine
Why shes got _lavender_ tops on her shoes and

Dont look round she warned him sharply Dont

Well whats he doing at a Baptist church Whats he fidgeting at his
handkerchief about Why cant he walk like people Does he think its
obligatory to walk home from church anchored arminarm like Swedes on a
Sunday Out Who _is_ this coweyed fat girl thats got him anyhow

Hush Dont look round again John

Never fear said her husband having disobeyed Theyve turned off
theyre crossing over to Bullard Street Who is it

I think her names Rust Mrs Milholland informed him I dont know
what her father does Shes one of the girls in his class at school

Well thats just like a boy pick out some puttyfaced flirt to take
to church

Oh shes quite prettyin that way said his wife deprecatingly Of
course thats the danger with public schools It would be pleasanter if
hed taken a fancy to someone whose family belongs to our own circle

Taken a fancy he echoed hooting Why hes terrible He looked
like a redgilled goldfish thats flopped itself out of the bowl Why
he

I _say_ I wish if he felt that he had to take girls anywhere said
Mrs Milholland with the primmest air of speaking to the pointif
this sort of thing _must_ begin I wish he might have selected some
nice girl among the daughters of our own friends like Dora Yocum for
instance

Upon the spot she began to undergo the mortification of a mother who has
expected her son just out of infancy to look about him with the eye of
a critical matron of fortyfive Moreover she was indiscreet enough
to express her views to Ramsey a week later producing thus a scene of
useless great fury and no little sound

I do think its in _very_ poor taste to see so much of any one girl
Ramsey she said and not heeding his protest that he only walked home
from school with Milla about every other day and that it didnt seem
any crime to him just to go to church with her a couple o times Mrs
Milholland went on But if you think you really _must_ be dangling
around somebody quite this muchthough what in the world you find to
_talk_ about with this funny little Milla Rust you poor father says he
really cannot seeand of course it seems very queer to us that youd
be willing to waste so much time just now when your mind ought to be
entirely on your studies and especially with such an absurd _looking_
little thing

No you must listen Ramsey and let me speak now What I meant was
that we shouldnt be _quite_ so much distressed by your being seen with
a girl who dressed in better taste and seemed to have some notion of
refinement though of course its only natural she _wouldnt_ with a
father who is just a sort of ward politician I understand and a mother
we dont know and of course shouldnt care to But oh Ramsey if you
_had_ to make yourself so conspicuous why couldnt you be a little _bit_
more fastidious Your father wouldnt have minded nearly so much if it
had been a selfrespecting intellectual girl We both say that if you
_must_ be so ridiculous at your age as to persist in seeing more of one
girl than another why oh why dont you go and see some really nice
girl like Dora Yocum

Ramsey was already dangerously distended as an effect of the earlier
part of her discourse and the word fastidious almost exploded him
but upon the climax Dora Yocum he blew up with a shattering report
and leaving fragments of incoherence ricocheting behind him fled
shuddering from the house

For the rest of the school term he walked home with Milla every
afternoon and on Sundays appeared to have become a resolute Baptist It
was supposed by the interested members of the highschool class that
Ramsey and Milla were engaged Ramsey sometimes rather supposed they
were himself and the dim idea gave him a sensation partly pleasant but
mostly apprehensive he was afraid

He was afraid that the day was coming when he ought to kiss her





Chapter VIII

Vacation in spite of increased leisure may bring inconvenience to
people in Ramseys strange but not uncommon condition At home his
constant air was that of a badgered captive plaintively silent under
injustice and he found it difficult to reply calmly when asked where
he was goingan inquiry addressed to him he asserted every time he
touched his cap even to hang it up

The amount of evening walking he did must also have been a trial to his
nerves on account of fatigue though the ground covered was not vast
Millas mother and father were friendly people but saw no reason
to move out of house and home as Mr Rust said when Milla had
callers and on account of the intimate plan of their small dwelling
a visitors only alternative to spending the evening with Mr and Mrs
Rust as well as with Milla was to invite her to go out walking

Evening after evening they walked and walked and walked usually in
companyat perhaps the distance of half a blockwith Albert Paxton and
Sadie Clews though Ramsey now and then felt disgraced by having fallen
into this class for sometimes it was apparent that Albert casually had
his arm about Sadies waist This allured Ramsey somewhat but terrified
him more He didnt know how such matters were managed

Usually the quartet had no destination they just went out walking
until ten oclock when both girls had to be homeand the boys did
too but never admitted it On Friday evenings there was a public
openair concert by a brass band in a small park and the four were
always there A political speechmaker occupied the bandstand one night
and they stood for an hour in the midst of the crowd listening vaguely

The orator saddled his politics upon patriotism Do you intend to let
this glorious country go to wrack and ruin oh my good friends he
demanded or do you intend to save her Look forth upon this country of
ours I bid you oh my countrymen and tell me what you see You see
a fair domain of forest mountain plain and fertile valleys sweeping
from ocean to ocean Look from the sturdy rocks of old New England
pledged to posterity by the stern religious hardihood of the Pilgrim
Fathers across the cornbearing midland country that land of milk
and honey won for us by the pluck and endurance of the indomitable
pioneers to where in sunshine roll the smiling Sierras of golden
California given to our heritage by the unconquerable energy of those
brave men and women who braved the tomahawk on the Great Plains the
tempest of Cape Horn and the fevers of Panama to make American soil
of El Dorado America Oh my America how glorious you stand Country
of Washington and Valley Forge out of what martyrdoms hast thou arisen
Country of Lincoln in his box at Fords theatre his lifeblood staining
to a brighter holier red the red white and blue of the Old Flag
Always and always I see the Old Flag fluttering the more sacredly
encrimsoned in the breeze for the martyrs who have upheld it Always I
see that Old Flag

Milla gave Ramseys arm within her own a little tug Come on she
said Sade says she dont want to hang around here any longer Its
awful tiresome Lets go

He consented placidly The oration meant nothing to him and stirred no
one in the audience The orator was impassioned he shouted himself into
coughing fits gesticulated grew purple he was so hot that his
collar caved in and finally swooned upon his neck in soggy exhaustion
prostrate round his thunderings Meanwhile the people listened with an
air of patience yawning here and there and gradually growing fewer It
was the old old usual thing made up of phrases that Ramsey had heard
dinning away on a thousand such occasions and other kinds of occasions
until they meant to him no more than so much sound He was bored and
glad to leave

Kind o funny he said as they sagged along the street at their usual
tortoise gait

What is it Ramsey

Seems kind o funny they never have anything to say any one can
take any interest in Always the same ole whoopetywhoop about George
Washington and Pilgrim Fathers and so on I bet five dollars before
long wed of heard him goin on about our martyred Presidents William
McKinley and James A Garfield and Benjamin Harrison and all so on and
then some more about the ole Red White and Blue Dont you wish theyd
_quit_ sometimes about the Ole Flag

I dunno said Milla I wasnt listening any at all I hate speeches

Well I could _stand_ em Ramsey said more generously if theyd
ever give anybody a little to think about Whats the use always
draggin in George Warshington and the Ole Flag And who wants to
hear any more ole truck about from ole rocky New England to golden
California and how big and fine the United States is and how its the
land of the Free and all that Why dont they ever say anything new
Thats what Id like to know

Milla laughed and when he asked why she told him shed never heard
him talk so much at one stretch I guess that speech got you kind of
wound up she said Lets talk about something different

I just soon he agreed And so they walked on in silence which
seemed to suit Milla She hung weightily upon his arm and they dawdled
drifting from one side of the pavement to the other as they slowly
advanced Albert and Sadie ahead of them called goodnight from a
corner before turning down the side street where Sadie lived and then
presently Ramsey and Milla were at the latters gate He went in with
her halting at the front steps

Well gnight Milla he said Want to go out walking tomorrow
night Albert and Sadie are

I cant tomorrow night she told him with obvious regret Isnt it
the worst luck I got an aunt comin to visit from Chicago and shes
crazy about playing Five Hundred and Mama and Papa said I haf to stay
in to make four to play it Shes liable to be here three or four days
and I guess I got to be around home pretty much all the time shes here
Its the worst luck

He was doleful but ventured to be literary Well what cant be helped
must be endured Ill come around when shes gone

He moved as if to depart but she still retained his arm and did not
prepare to relinquish it

Well he said

Well what Ramsey

Wellgnight

She glanced up at the dark front of the house I guess the familys
gone to bed she said absently

I spose so

Well goodnight Ramsey She said this but still did not release his
arm and suddenly in a fluster he felt that the time he dreaded had
come Somehow without knowing where except that it was somewhere upon
what seemed to be a blurred face too full of obstructing features he
kissed her

She turned instantly away in the darkness her hands over her cheeks
and in a panic Ramsey wondered if he hadnt made a dreadful mistake

Scuse me he said stumbling toward the gate Well I guess I got to
be gettin along back home





Chapter IX

He woke in the morning to a great selfloathing he had kissed a girl
Mingled with the loathing was a curious pride in the very fact that
caused the loathing but the pride did not last long He came downstairs
morbid to breakfast and continued this mood afterward At noon Albert
Paxton brought him a note which Milla had asked Sadie to ask Albert to
give him

Dearie I am just wondering if you thought as much about something so
sweet that happened last night as I did you know what I think it was
the sweetest thing I send you one with this note and I hope you will
think it is a sweet one I would give you a real one if you were here
now and I hope you would think it was sweeter still than the one I put
in this note It is the sweetest thing now you are mine and I am yours
forever kiddo If you come around about friday eve it will be all right
aunt Jess will be gone back home by then so come early and we will get
Sade and Alb and go to the band Concert Dont forget what I said about
my putting something sweet in this note and I hope you will think it is
a sweet one but not as sweet as the _real_ sweet one I would like to

At this point Ramsey impulsively tore the note into small pieces He
turned cold as his imagination projected a sketch of his mother in
the act of reading this missive and of her expression as she read the
sentence It is the sweetest thing now you are mine and I am yours
forever kiddo He wished that Milla hadnt written kiddo She called
him that sometimes but in her warm little voice the word seemed not at
all what it did in ink He wished too that she hadnt said she was his
forever

Suddenly he was seized with a horror of her

Moisture broke out heavily upon him he felt a definite sickness and
wishing for death went forth upon the streets to walk and walk He
cared not whither so that his feet took him in any direction away from
Milla since they were unable to take him away from himselfof whom he
had as great a horror Her loving face was continually before him and
its sweetness made his flesh creep Milla had been too sweet

When he met or passed people it seemed to him that perhaps they were
able to recognize upon him somewhere the marks of his low quality
Softy Ole sloppy fool he muttered addressing himself Slushy ole
mush _Spooner_ And he added Yours forever kiddo Convulsions
seemed about to seize him

Turning a corner with his head down he almost charged into Dora Yocum
She was homeward bound from a piano lesson and carried a rolled leather
case of sheet musicsomething he couldnt imagine Milla carryingand
in her young girls dress which attempted to be nothing else she
looked as wholesome as cold spring water Ramsey had always felt
that she despised him and now all at once he thought that she was
justified Leper that he had become he was unworthy to be even touching
his cap to her And as she nodded and went briskly on he would have
given anything to turn and walk a little way with her for it seemed to
him that this might fumigate his morals But he lacked the courage and
besides he considered himself unfit to be seen walking with her

He had a long afternoon of anguishes these becoming most violent when
he tried to face the problem of his future course toward Milla He did
not face it at all in fact but merely writhed and had evolved nothing
when Friday evening was upon him and Milla waiting for him to take her
to the band concert with Alb and Sade In his thoughts by that
time this harmless young pair shared the contamination of his own
crime and he regarded them with aversion however he made shift to
seek a short interview with Albert just before dinner

I got a pretty rotten headache and my stomachs upset too he said
drooping upon the Paxtons fence I been gettin worse every minute
You and Sadie go by Millas Albert and tell her if Im not there by
hapasseven tell her not to wait for me any longer

How do you mean wait Albert inquired You dont expect her to come
pokin along with Sadie and me do you Shell keep on sittin there at
home just the same because she wouldnt have anything else to do if
you dont come like she expects you to She hasnt got any way to _stop_
waitin

At this Ramsey moaned without affectation I dont expect I _can_
Albert he said Id like to if I could but the way it looks now
you tell her I wouldnt be much surprised maybe I was startin in with
typhoid fever or pretty near anything at all You tell her Im pretty
near as disappointed as shes goin to be herself and Id come if I
couldand I _will_ come if I get a good deal better or anythingbut
the way its gettin to look now I kind o feel as if I might be
breaking out with something any minute He moved away concluding
feebly I guess I better crawl on home Albert while Im still able
to walk some You tell her the way it looks now Im liable to be right
sick

And the next morning he woke to the chafings of remorse picturing a
Milla somewhat restored in charm waiting hopefully at the gate even
after halfpast seven and then as time passed and the sound of the
distant horns came faintly through the darkness going sadly to her
roomperhaps weeping there It was a picture to wring him with shame
and pity but was followed by another which electrified him for out
of school he did not lack imagination What if Albert had reported his
illness too vividly to Milla Milla was so fond What if in her alarm
she should come here to the house to inquire of his mother about him
What if she told Mrs Milholland they were engaged The next moment
Ramsey was projecting a conversation between his mother and Milla in
which the latter stated that she and Ramsey were soon to be married
that she regarded him as already virtually her husband and demanded to
nurse him

In a panic he fled from the house before breakfast going out by way of
a side door and he crossed back yards and climbed back fences to reach
Albert Paxton the more swiftly This creature a ladies man almost
professionally was found exercising with an electric iron and a pair of
flannel trousers in a basement laundry by way of stirring his appetite
for the morning meal

See here Albert his friend said breathlessly I got a favour I
want you to go over to Millas

Im goin to finish pressin these trousers Albert interrupted Then
Ive got my breakfast to eat

Well you could do this first said Ramsey hurriedly It wouldnt
hurt you to do me this little favour first You just slip over and see
Milla for me if shes up yet and if she isnt you better wait around
there till she is because I want you to tell her Im a whole lot better
this morning Tell her Im pretty near practickly all right again
Albert and Ill probly write her a note or something right soonor in
a week or so anyhow You tell her

Well you act pretty funny Albert exclaimed fumbling in the pockets
of his coat Why cant you go on over and tell her yourself

I would said Ramsey Id be perfectly willing to go only I got to
get back home to breakfast

Albert stared Well I got to go upstairs and eat my own breakfast in
about a minute havent I But just as it happens there wouldnt be any
use your goin over there or me either

Why not

Milla aint there said Albert still searching the pockets of his
coat When we went by her house last night to tell her about your
headache and stomach and all why her mother told us Millad gone up to
Chicago yesterday afternoon with her aunt and said she left a note for
you and she said if you were sick I better take it and give it to you
I was goin to bring it over to your house after breakfast He found
it Here

Ramsey thanked him feebly and departed in a state of partial
stupefaction brought on by a glimpse of the instabilities of life He
had also not relief but a sense of vacancy and loss for Milla out of
his reach once more became mysteriously lovely

Pausing in an alley he read her note

Dearie Thought I ought to call you up but over the phone is just nix
for explanations as Mama and Aunt Jess would hear everything and thought
I might seem cold to you not saying anything sweet on account of them
listening and you would wonder why I was so cold when telling you
goodby for a wile maybe weeks It is this way Uncle Purv wired Aunt
Jess he has just taken in a big touring car on a debt and his vacation
starts tomorrow so if they were going to take a trip they better start
right way so Aunt Jess invited me It is going to be a big trip up
around the lakes and I have always wanted to go touring more than
anything in the world stopping at hotels and all and Mama said I ought
to it would be so splendid for my health as she thinks I am failing some
lately Now dearie I have to pack and write this in a hurry so you will
not be disappointed when you come by for the B C tonight Do not go
get some other girl and take her for I would hate her and nothing in
this world make me false for one second to my kiddo boy I do not know
just when home again as the folks think I better stay up there for a
visit at Aunt Jess and Uncle Purvs home in Chicago after the trip is
over But I will think of you all the time and you must think of me
every minute and believe your own dearie she will never no not for one
second be false So tell Sade and Alb goodby for me and do not be
false to me any more than I would be to you and it will not be long till
nothing more will interrupt our sweet friendship

As a measure of domestic prudence Ramsey tore the note into irreparable
fragments but he did this slowly and without experiencing any of the
revulsion created by Millas former missive

He was melancholy aggrieved that she should treat him so





Chapter X

He never saw her again She sent him a picture postal from Oconomowoc
Wisconsin which his father disengaged from the family mail one morning
at breakfast and considerately handed to him without audible comment
Upon it was written _Oh you Ramsey_ This was the last of Milla

Just before school opened in the autumn Sadie Clews made some
revelations Milla did like you said Sadie After that time you
jumped in the creek to save her she liked you better than any boy in
town and I guess if it wasnt for her cousin Milt up in Chicago she
would of liked you the best anywhere I guess she did anyway because
she hadnt seen him for about a year then

Well that afternoon she went away I was over there and took in
everything that was goin on only she made me promise on my word of
honour I wouldnt even tell Albert They didnt get any wire from her
uncle about the touring car it was her cousin Milt that jumped on the
train and came down and fixed it all up for Milla to go on the trip and
everything You see Ramsey she was turned back a couple of times in
school before she came in our class and I dont exactly know how old
she is and she dont _look_ old yet but Im pretty sure shes at least
eighteen and she might be over Her mother kept tellin her all the
time you were just a kid and didnt have anything to support her on
and lots of things like that I didnt think such a great deal of this
Milts looks myself but hes anyway twentyone years old and got a
good position and all their family seem to think hes just fine It
wasnt his father that took in the touring car on debt like she said
she was writing to you it was Milt himself He started out in business
when he was only fifteen years old and this trip he was gettin up for
his father and mother and Milla was the first vacation he ever took
Well of course she wouldnt like my tellin you but I cant see the
harm of it now everythings all over

Allall over You mean Millas going to beto be married

She already is said Sadie They got married at her Aunt Jess and
Uncle Purvs house up in Chicago last Thursday Yes sir that quiet
little Millas a regular old married woman by this time I expect
Ramsey

When he got over the shock which was not until the next day one
predominating feeling remained it was a gloomy pridea pride in his
proven maturity He was old enough it appeared to have been the same
thing as engaged to a person who was now a Married Woman His manner
thenceforth showed an added trace of seriousness and selfconsideration

Having recovered his equipoise and something more he entirely forgot
that moment of humble admiration he had felt for Dora Yocum on the day
of his flattest prostration When he saw her sitting in the classroom
smiling brightly up at the teacher the morning of the schools opening
in the autumn all his humility had long since vanished and she appeared
to him not otherwise than as the scholar whose complete proficiency had
always been so irksome to him

Look at her he muttered to himself Same ole Teachers Pet

Now and then as the days and seasons passed and Doras serene progress
continued never checked or even flawed there stirred within some
lingerings of the old determination to show her and he would conjure
up a daydream of Dora in loud lamentation while he led the laughter of
the spectators But gradually his feelings about her came to be merely a
dull oppression He was tired of having to look at her as he stated it
and he thanked the Lord that the time wouldnt be so long now until hed
be out of that ole school and then all hed have to do hed just take
care never to walk by her house it was easy enough to use some other
street when he had to go downtown

The good ole class of NineteenFourteen is about gone he said to Fred
Mitchell who was still his most intimate friend when they reached the
senior year Yes sir its held together a good many years Fred but
after June itll be busted plum up and I hope nobody starts a move to
have any reunions Theres a good many members of the ole class that I
can stand and theres some I cant but theres one I just wont If we
ever did call a reunion that ole Yocum girl would start in right away
and run the whole shebang and thats where Id resign You know Fred
the thing _I_ think is the one biggest benefit of graduating from this
ole school Its never seein Dora Yocum again

This was again his theme as he sat by the same friends side in the
rear row of the class at Commencement listening to the delivery of
the Valedictory Thinks shes just sooblime dont she he whispered
morosely She wouldnt trade with the President of the United States
right now She probly thinks bein Valedictorian is more important than
Captain of the State University Eleven Never mind And here his tone
became huskily jubilant Never mind Just about a halfanhour more
and thats the last o _you_ ole girl Yes sir Fred one thing we can
feel pretty good over this is where we get through with Dora Yocum

Ramsey and Fred had arranged to room together at Greenfield the seat
of the state university and they made the short journey in company the
following September They arrived hilarious anticipating pleasurable
excitements in the way of fraternity pledgings and initiations
encounters with sophomores class meetings and elections and also
they were not absolutely without interest in the matter of Girls for
the state university was coeducational and it was but natural to
expect in so broad a field all new to them a possible vision of
something rather thrilling They whispered cheerfully of all these
things during the process of matriculation and signed the registrars
book on a fresh page but when Fred had written his name under Ramseys
and blotted it he took the liberty of turning over the leaf to examine
some of the autographs of their future classmates written on the other
side Then he uttered an exclamation more droll than dolorous though
it affected to be wholly the latter for the shock to Fred was by no
means so painful as it was to his friend

Ramsey leaned forward and read the name indicated by Freds forefinger

_Dora Yocum_

When they got back to their pleasant quarters at Mrs Meigs facing
the campus Ramsey was still unable to talk of anything except the
lamentable discovery nor were his companions burlesquing efforts to
console him of great avail though Fred did become serious enough to
point out that a university was different from a high school

Its not like havin to use one big room as a headquarters you know
Ramsey Everythings all split up and she might happen not to be in a
single of your classes

You dont know my luck the afflicted boy protested I wish Id gone
to Harvard the way my father wanted me to Why this is just the worst
nuisance I ever struck Youll see Shell be in everything there is
just the way she was back home

He appeared to be corroborated by the events of the next day when they
attended the first meeting to organize the new class The masculine
element predominated but Dora Yocum was elected vicepresident You
see Ramsey said Didnt I tell you You see what happens

But after that she ceased for a time to intrude upon his life and he
admitted that his harassment was less grave than he had anticipated
There were about five hundred students in the freshman class he seldom
saw her and when he did it was not more than a distant glimpse of her
on one of the campus paths her thoughtful head bent over a book as
she hurried to a classroom This was bearable and in the flattering
agitations of being sought and even hunted by several fraternities
simultaneously desirous of his becoming a sworn Brother he almost
forgot her After a hazardous month the roommates fell into the arms of
the last frat to seek them and having undergone an evening of outrage
which concluded with touching rhetoric and an oath taken at midnight
they proudly wore jewelled symbols on their breasts and were free to
turn part of their attention to other affairs especially the affairs of
the Eleven

However they were instructed by the older brethren of their Order
whose duty it was to assist in the proper manoeuvring of their young
careers that although support of the varsity teams was important
they must neglect neither the spiritual nor the intellectual byproducts
of undergraduate doings Therefore they became members of the college
YMCA and of the Lumen Society

According to the charter which it had granted itself the Lumen
Society was an Organization of male and female studentsso
advanced was this universityfor the development of the powers of
debate and oratory intellectual and sociological progress and
the discussion of all matters relating to philosophy metaphysics
literature art and current events A statement so formidable was not
without a hushing effect upon Messrs Milholland and Mitchell they went
to their first Lumen meeting in a state of fear and came away little
reassured

I couldnt get up there Ramsey declared I couldnt stand up there
before all that crowd and make a speech or debate in a debate to save
my soul and gizzard Why Id just keel right over and haf to be carried
out

Well the way I understand it said Fred we cant get out of it
The seniors in the frat said we had to join and they said we couldnt
resign either after we had joined They said we just had to go through
it and after a while wed get used to it and not mind it much

_I_ will Ramsey insisted I couldnt any more stand up there on my
feet and get to spoutin about sociology and the radical metempsychorus
of the metaphysical bazoozum than I could fly a flyin machine Why
I

Oh that wasnt anything Fred interrupted The only one that talked
like that he was that Blickens hes a tutor or something and really
a member of the faculty Most o the others just kind of blahblahhed
around and what any of em tried to get off their chests hardly
amounted to terribly much

I dont care I couldnt do it at _all_

Well the way it looks to me Fred observed we simply _got_ to From
what they tell me the freshmen got to do more than anybody Every other
Friday night its all freshmen and nothin else You get a postal card
on Monday morning in your mail and it says Assignment on it and
then its got written underneath what you haf to do the next Friday
nightoration or debate or maybe just read from some old book or
something I guess we got to stand up there and _try_ anyway

All right said Ramsey If they want me to commit suicide they can
send me one o their ole Assignments I wont need to commit suicide
though I guess All Ill do Ill just fall over in a fit and stay in
it

And in truth when he received his first Assignment one Monday
morning a month later he seemed in a fair way to fulfil his prophecy
The attention of his roommate who sat at a window of their study was
attracted by sounds of strangulation

What on earths the matter Ramsey

Look Look at _this_

Fred took the card and examined it with an amazement gradually merging
into a pleasure altogether too perceptible

ASSIGNMENT

TWELVEMINUTE DEBATE CLASS OF 1918 _Subject Resolved_ That Germany
is both legally and morally justified in her invasion of Belgium

Debaters are notified that each will be held strictly to the following
schedule Affirmative 4 min first Negative 4 min first Affirm 2
min second Neg 2 min second

Affirmative Negative R MILHOLLAND 18 D YOCUM 18

Concluding his reading which was oral the volatile Mitchell made use
of his voice in a manner of heathenish boisterousness and presently
reclined upon a lounge to laugh the better His stricken comrade
meanwhile recovered so far as to pace the floor Im goin to pack up
and light out for home he declared over and over And even oftener
he read and reread the card to make sure of the actuality of that fatal
coincidence D Yocum 18





Chapter XI

If I _could_ do it he vociferated if I _could_ stand up there and
debate one o their darn ole debates in the first placeif I had the
gall to even try it why my gosh you dont suppose Im goin to get
up there and argue with _that girl_ do you Thats a hot way to get
an education stand up there and argue with a girl before a couple o
hundred people My _gosh_

You got to his prostrate companion cackled weakly You cant get
out of it Youre a goner ole Buddy


Ill be sick Ill be sick as a dog Ill be sick as the sickest dog
that ever

No use ole man The frat seniorsll be on the job Theyll know
whether youre sick or not and theyll have you there right on the
spot to the minute

The prediction was accurate The too fatherly frat seniors did all
that Fred said they would and more For the honour of the frat they
coached the desperate Ramsey in the technic of Lumen debate told him
many more things to say than could be said in six minutes and produced
him despairing ghastly and bedewed in the large hall of the Lumen
Society at eight oclock on Friday evening

Four other twelveminute debates preceded his and the sound of these
in Ramseys ears was the sound of Gabriel practising on his horn in
the early morning of Judgment Day The members of the society sat three
rows deep along the walls of the room leaving a clear oblong of green
carpet in the centre where were two small desks twenty feet apart the
rostrums of the debaters Upon a platform at the head of the room sat
dreadful seniors the officers of the society and upon benches near
the platform the debaters of the evening were aligned One of the
fraternal seniors sat with sweltering Ramsey and the latter as his
time relentlessly came nearer made a last miserable squirm

Look here Brother Colburn I got to get out o here

No you dont young fellow

Yes I do Ramsey whispered passionately Honest I do Honest
Brother Colburn I got to get a drink of water I _got_ to

No You cant

Honest Colburn I _got_

Hush

Ramsey grunted feebly and cast his dilating eyes along the rows of
faces Most of them were but as blurs swimming yet he was aware he
thought of a formidable and horrible impassive scrutiny of himself a
glare seeming to pierce through him to the back of the belt round his
waist so that he began to have fearful doubts about that belt about
every fastening and adjustment of his garments about the expression of
his countenance and about many other things jumbling together in his
consciousness Over and over he whispered gaspingly to himself the
opening words of the sentence with which Colburn had advised him to
begin his argument And as the moment of supreme agony drew close this
whispering became continuous In making my first appearance before
this honorble membership I feel constrained to say in making my first
appearance before this honorble membership I feel constrained to say in
making my first appearance before this honorble mem

It had come The chairman announced the subject of the fourth
freshman twelveminute debate and Dora Yocum hitherto unperceived
by Ramsey rose and went forward to one of the small desks in the open
space where she stood composedly a slim pretty figure in white
Members in Ramseys neighbourhood were aware of a brief and hushed
commotion and of Colburns fierce whisper You cant You get up
there And the blanched Ramsey came forth and placed himself at the
other desk

He stood before the silent populace of that morgue and it seemed to him
that his features had forgotten that he was supposed to be their owner
and in control of them he felt that they were slipping all over his
face regardless of his wishes His head as a whole was subject to
an agitation not before known by him it desired to move rustily in
eccentric ways of its own devising his legs alternately limbered and
straightened under no direction but their own and his hands clutched
each other fiercely behind his back he was not one cohesive person
evidently but an assembled collection of parts which had relapsed each
into its own individuality In spite of them he somehow contrived the
semblance of a bow toward the chairman and the semblance of another
toward Dora of whom he was but hazily conscious Then he opened his
mouth and not knowing how he had started his voice going heard it as
if from a distance

In making my first appearance before this honorble membership I feel
restrained to say He stopped short and thenceforward shook visibly
After a long pause he managed to repeat his opening stopped again
swallowed many times produced a handkerchief and wiped his face an act
of necessitythen had an inspiration

The subject assigned to me he said is resolved that Germany is
morly and legally justified in BelgiansBelgiums This subject was
assigned to me to be the subject of this debate He interrupted himself
to gasp piteously found breathing difficult but faltered again This
subject is the subject It is the subject that was assigned to me on
a postal card Then for a moment or so he had a miraculous spurt of
confidence and continued rather rapidly I feel constrained to say
that the country of BelgianBelgium I meanthis country has been
constrained by theinvaded I meaninvaded by the imperial German
Impire and my subject in this debate is whether it ought to or not my
being the infernativeaffirmative I meanthat I got to prove that
Germany is morly and legally justified I wish to state that

He paused again lengthily then struggled on I have been requested
to state that the German ImpEmpirethat it certainly isnt right
for those DutchGermans I meanthey havent got any more business in
Belgium than I have myself but II feel constrained to say that I had
to accept whatever side of this debate I got on the postal card and so
I am constrained to take the side of the Dutch I mean the Germans The
Dutch are sometimes calledI mean the Germans are sometimes called the
Dutch in this country but they arent Dutch though sometimes called
Dutch in this country Well and soso well the war began last August
or about then anyway and the German army invaded the Belgian army
After they got there the invasion began First they came around there
and then they commenced invading Well what I feel constrained

He came to the longest of all his pauses here and the awful gravity of
the audience almost suffocated him Well he concluded it dont look
right to me

Four minutes the chairman announced for Ramseys pauses had worn
away a great deal more of this terrible interval than had his eloquence
Opening statement for the negative Miss D Yocum Four minutes

As Dora began to speak Ramsey experienced a little relief but only
a littleabout the same amount of relief as that felt by a bridegroom
when it is the brides turn to respond not really relief at all but
merely the slight relaxation of a continuing strain The audience now
looked at Ramsey no more than people look at a bridegroom but he failed
to perceive any substantial mitigation of his frightful conspicuousness
He had not the remotest idea of what he had said in setting forth his
case for Germany and he knew that it was his duty to listen closely
to Dora in order to be able to refute her argument when his twominute
closing speech fell due but he was conscious of little more than his own
condition His legs had now gone wild beyond all devilry and he had
to keep shifting his weight from one to the other in order even to hope
that their frenzy might escape general attention

He realized that Dora was speaking rapidly and confidently and that
somewhere in his illassembled parts lurked a familiar bit of him that
objected to her even more than usual but she had used half of her time
at least before he was able to gather any coherent meaning from what
she was saying Even then he caught only a fragment here and there
and for the restso far as Ramsey was concernedshe might as well have
been reciting the Swedish alphabet

In spite of the rather startling feebleness of her opponents statement
Dora went at her task as earnestly as if it were to confute some monster
of casuistry Thus having demonstrated that _all_ war is wrong she
said approaching her conclusion it is scarcely necessary to point out
that whatever the actual circumstances of the invasion and whatever the
status of the case in international law or by reason of treaty or the
German oath to respect the neutrality of Belgium which of course was
grossly and dishonorably violatedall this I say ladies and gentlemen
of the Lumen Society all this is beside the point of morals Since as
I have shown _all_ war is wrong the case may be simplified as follows
All war is morally wrong _Quod erat demonstrandum_ Germany invaded
Belgium Invasion is war Germany therefore did moral wrong Upon
the legal side as I began by pointing out Germany confessed in the
Reichstag the violation of law Therefore Germany was justified in the
invasion neither morally nor legally but was both morally and legally
wrong and evil Ladies and gentlemen of the Lumen Society I await the
refutation of my opponent

Her opponent appeared to be having enough trouble with his legs without
taking any added cares upon himself in the way of refutations But the
marvellous Dora had calculated the length of her statement with such
nicety that the chairman announced Four minutes almost upon the
instant of her final syllable and all faces turned once more to
the upholder of the affirmative Refutation and conclusion by the
affirmative said the chairman Mr R Milholland Two minutes

Therewith Ramsey coughed as long as he could cough and when he felt
that no more should be done in this way he wiped his faceagain an act
of necessityand quaveringly began

Gentlemen and ladies or ladies and gentlemen in making the refutation
of my opponent I feel thatI feel that hardly anything more ought to
be said

He paused looked helplessly at his uncontrollable legs and resumed
I am supposed to make the reputathe refutation of my opponent and I
feel that I ought to say quite a good deal more In the first place I
feel that the invasion has taken place I am supposedanyhow I got a
postal card that I am supposed to be here tonight Well in talking
over this matter with a couple of seniors they told me I was supposed
to claim this invasion was morly and legally all right Well Here
by some chance the recollection of a word of Doras flickered into his
chaotic mind and he had a brighter moment My opponent said she proved
all war is wrongor something like that anyhow She said she proved it
was wrong to fight no matter what Well if she wasnt a girl anybody
that wanted to get her into a fight could probly do it He did not
add that he would like to be the person to make the experiment if Dora
werent a girl nor did the thought enter his mind until an hour or so
later Well he added I suppose there is little more to be said

He was so right in regard to his own performance at least that
thereupon drying up utterly he proceeded to stand a speechless
figure in the midst of a multitudinous silence for an eternity lasting
fortyfive seconds He made a racking effort and at the end of this
epoch found words again In making my argument in this debate I would
state that

Two minutes said the chairman Refutation by the negative Miss D
Yocum Two minutes

I waive them said Dora primly I submit that the affirmative has
not refuted the argument of the negative

Very well With his gavel the chairman sharply tapped the desk before
him The question is now before the house Resolved that Germany
is both morally and legally justified in her invasion of Belgium All
those in favour of the

But here there was an interruption of a kind never before witnessed
during any proceedings of the Lumen Society It came from neither of
the debaters who still remained standing at their desks until the
vote settling their comparative merits in argument should be taken The
interruption was from the rear row of seats along the wall where
sat new members of the society freshmen not upon the program for the
evening A loud voice was heard from this quarter a loud but nasal
voice shrill as well as nasal and full of a strange hot passion Mr
Chairman it cried Lookahere Mr Chairman Mr Chairman I demand
to be heard You gotta gimme my say Mr Chairman Im agunna have my
_say_ You lookahere Mr Chairman

Shocked by such a breach of order and by the unseemly violence of the
speaker not only the chairman but everyone else looked there A short
strong figure was on its feet gesticulating fiercely and the head
belonging to it was a large one with too much curly black hair a flat
swarthy face shiny and not immaculately shaven there was an impression
of illchosen clothes too much fat red lip too much tooth too much
eyeball Fred Mitchell halfsorrowing yet struggling to conceal tears
of choked mirth over his roommates late exhibition recognized this
violent interrupter as one Linski a fellow freshman who sat next to him
in one of his classes Whats _that_ cuss up to Fred wondered and so
did others Linski showed them

He pressed forward shoving himself through the two rows in front of him
till he emerged upon the green carpet of the open space and as he came
he was cyclonic with words

You dont put no such stuff as this over I tell you he shouted in
his hot nasal voice This heres a free country and you call yourself
a debating society do you Lemme tell you _I_ belong to a debating
society in Chicago where I come from and them fellas up there theyd
think theyd oughta be shot fer a fake like what you people are
tryin to put over here tonight I come down here to git some more
education and pay fer it too in good hard money Ive made sweatin
in a machine shop up there in Chicago but if _this_ is the kind of
education Im agunna git I better go on back there You call this a
square debate do you

He advanced toward the chairmans platform shaking a frantic fist
Well if you do you got another think comin my capitalis frien
you went and give out the question whether its right fer Choimuny to go
through Belgium and what do you do fer the Choimun side You pick out
this here big stiffhe waved his passionate hand at the paralyzed
Ramseyyou pick out a boob like that for the Choimun side a poor fish
that gits stagefright so bad he dont know whether hes talkin or dead
or else he fakes it because hes a speaker so bum it looks more to me
like he was faking You get this big stiff to fake the Choimun side and
then you go and stick up a goil agains him thats got brains and makes
a pacifis argument that wins the case agains the Choimuns like cuttin
through hog lard But you aint agunna git away with it mister
Lemme tell you right here and now I may be a mix blood but I got some
Choimun in me with the rest what I got and before you vote on this here
question you gotta hear a few woids from somebody that can _talk_ This
whole war is a capitalis war Belgium as much as Choimuny and the
United States is sellin its soul to the capitalis right now I tell

millions and the capitalis United States is fat already on the blood
of the workers of Europe Yes it is and Ill have my _say_ you
boorjaw faker and you can hammer your ole gavel to pieces at me

He had begun to shriek moisture fell from his brow and his mouth the
scandalized society was on its feet nervously into groups Evidently
the meeting was about to disintegrate Ill have my _say_ the
frenzied Linski screamed You try to put up this capitalis trick and
work a fake to carry over this debate agains Choimuny but you cant
work it on _me_ lemme tell you Ill have my _say_

The outraged chairman was wholly at a loss how to deal with the
unprecedented situationso he defined it quite truthfully and he
continued to pound upon the desk while other clamours began to rival
Linskis shouts of Put him out Order Shut up Freshman Turn
him over to the sophomores

This meeting is _adjourned_ bellowed the chairman and there was a
thronging toward the doors while the frothing Linski asseverated Im
agunna git my say I tell you Ill have my say Ill have my _say_

He had more than that before the hour was over A moment after he
emerged from the building and came out still hot upon the cool dark
campus he found himself the centre of a group of his own classmates
whom he at first mistook for sophomores such was their manner

As this group broke up a few minutes later a youth running to
join it scenting somewhat of interest detained one of those who were
departing

Whats up What was that squealing

Oh nothing We just talked to that Linski Nobody else touched him
but Ramsey Milholland gave him a _peach_ of a punch on the snoot

Whoopee

Ramsey was laconic in response to inquiries upon this subject When
someone remarked You served him right for calling you a boob and a
poor fish and so on before all the society girls and all Ramsey only
said

That wasnt what I hit him for

He declined to explain further





Chapter XII

The way I look at it Ramsey Fred Mitchell said when they reached
their apartment whither the benevolent Colburn accompanied them the
way I look at it this Linski kind of paid you a compliment after all
when he called you a fake He must have thought you anyway _looked_ as
if you could make a better speech than you did Oh golly

And as Ramsey groaned the jovial Mitchell gave himself up to the divan
and the mirth Oh oh oh _golly_ he sputtered

Never you mind Brother Milholland Colburn said gently The Lumen is
used to nervous beginners Ive seen dozens in my time just like you
and some of em got to be first rate before they quit Besides this
crazy Linski is all that anybodyll ever remember about tonights
meeting anyhow There never was any such outbreak as that in _my_ time
and I guess there never was in the whole history of the society Well
probably suspend him until he apologizes to the societyIm on the
board and Im in favour of it Who is the bird anyhow Hes in your
class

I never saw him before Ramsey responded from the deep chair where
he had moodily thrown himself and returning to his brooding upon his
oratory Oh murder he moaned

Well said the senior youll know him when you see him again You
put your mark on him where you can see it all right He chuckled I
suppose I really ought to have interfered in that but I decided to do
a little astronomical observation about fifty feet away for a few
minutes Im way behind in my astronomy anyhow Do you know this
Linski Brother Mitchell

Ive talked to him a couple o times on the campus said Fred Hes
in one of my classes Hes about the oldest in our class I guessa
lot older than us anyhow Hes kind of an anarchist or something cant
talk moren five minutes any time without gettin off some bug stuff
about capitalism He said the course in political economy was all
capitalism and the prof was bought by Wall Street

Poor old Prof Craig Colburn laughed He gets fifteen hundred a
year

Yes Id heard that myself and I told Linski and he said he had an
uncle workin in a steel mill got twice that much but it didnt
make any difference ole Craig was bought by Wall Street He said
capitalism better look out he and the foreignborn workmen were goin
to _take_ this country some day and that was one of the reasons he was
after an education He talked pretty strong proGerman tooabout
the war in Europebut I sort of thought that was more because hed be
proanything that he thought would help upset the United States than
because he cared much about Germany

Yes said Colburn thats how he sounded tonight I guess theres
plenty more like him in the cities too That reminds me Id better
arrange a debate on immigration for the Lumen Well put Brother
Milholland for the negative this time

Ramsey started violently See here

But the senior reassured him Just wanted to see you jump he
explained Dont fear youve done your share

I should think I have Ramsey groaned

Yes you wont be called on again this term By the way said Colburn
thoughtfully that was a clever girl you had against you tonight I
dont believe in pacificism much myself but she used it very niftily
for her argument Isnt she from your town this Miss Yocum

Fred nodded

Well shes a clever young thing said the senior still thoughtful
And he added Graceful girl she is

At this the roommates looked at him with startled attention Ramsey was
so roused as to forget his troubles and sit forward in his chair

Yes said the musing Colburn shes a mighty pretty girl

What

This exclamation was a simultaneous one the astounded pair stared at
him in blank incredulity

Why dont you think so Colburn mildly inquired She seems to me
very unusual looking

Well yes Fred assented emphatically Were with you there

Extraordinary eyes continued Colburn Lovely figure too altogether
a strikingly pretty girl Handsome I should say perhaps Yes
handsome rather than pretty He looked up from a brief reverie
You fellows known her long

You bet said Ramsey

She made a splendid impression on the Lumen Colburn went on I dont
remember that I ever saw a first appearance there that quite equalled
it Shell probably have a brilliant career in the society and in the
university too She must be a very fine sort of person He deliberated
within himself a few moments longer then realizing that his hosts
and Brethren did not respond with any heartinessor with anything at
allto the theme he changed it and asked them what they thought about
the war in Europe

They talked of the war rather drowsily for a while it was an
interesting but not an exciting topic the thing they spoke of was so
far away It was in foreign countries where they had never been and
had no acquaintances and both the cause and the issue seemed to be in
confusion though evidently Germany had started the trouble Only
one thing emerged as absolutely clear and proved there could be no
disagreement about Germanys dirty work as Fred defined it in
violating Belgium And this stirred Ramsey to declare with justice that
dirty work had likewise been done upon himself by the official
person whoever he or she was who had given him the German side of
the evenings debate After this moment of fervour the conversation
languished and Brother Colburn rose to go

Well Im glad you gave that Linski a fine little punch Brother
Milholland he said at the door It wont do you any harm in the
frat or with the Lumen either And dont be discouraged about your
debating Youll learn Anybody might have got rattled by having to
argue against as clever and goodlooking a girl as that

The roommates gave each other a look of serious puzzlement as the door
closed Well Brother Colburn is a mighty nice fellow Fred said
Hes kind of funny though

Ramsey assented and then as the two prepared for bed they entered
into a further discussion of their senior friend They liked him all
right they said but he certainly must be kind of queer and they
couldnt just see how he had ever managed to get where he was in the
frat and the Lumen and the university





Chapter XIII

Ramsey passed the slightly disfigured Linski on the campus next day
without betraying any embarrassment or making a sign of recognition
Fred Mitchell told his roommate chuckling that Linski had sworn
to get him and not knowing Freds affiliations had made him the
confidant of his oath Fred had given his blessing he said upon the
enterprise and advised Linski to use a brick Hell hit you on the
head with it said the lighthearted Fred falling back upon this old
joke Then you can catch it as it bounces off and throw it back at
him

However Linski proved to be merely an episode not only so far as
Ramsey was concerned but in the Lumen and in the university as well His
suspension from the Lumen was for a year and so cruel a punishment it
proved for this born debater that he noisily declared he would found
a debating society himself and had a poster printed and distributed
announcing the first meeting of The Free Speech and Masses Rights
Council Several town loafers attended the meeting but the only
person connected with the university who came was an oriental student
a Chinese youth of almost intrusive amiability Linski made a fiery
address the townsmen loudly appluading his advocacy of an embargo
on munitions and the distribution of everybodys property but the
Chinaman accustomed to see students so madly in earnest only when
they were burlesquing took the whole affair to be intended humour and
tittered politely without cessationexcept at such times as he thought
it proper to appear quite wrung with laughter Then he would rock
himself clasp his mouth with both hands and splutter through his
fingers Linski accused him of being in the pay of capital

Next day the orator was unable to show himself upon the campus without
causing demonstrations whenever he was seen a file of quickly gathering
students marched behind him chanting repeatedly and deafeningly in
chorus Down with Wall Street Hoch der Kaiser Who loves Linski Who
who who Hoo Lun Who loves Linski Who who who Hoo Lun

Linski was disgusted resigned from the university and disappeared

Well here it isnt midyear Exams yet and the good ole class of
NineteenEighteens already lost a member said Fred Mitchell I guess
we can bear the breakup

I guess so Ramsey assented That Linski might just as well stayed
here though

Why

He couldnt do any harm here Hell probly get more people to listen
to him in cities where theres so many new immigrants and all such that
dont know anything comin in all the time

Oh well said Fred What do _we_ care what happens to Chicago Come
on lets behave real wild and go on over to the Teria and get us a
couple egg sandwiches and sassprilly

Ramsey was willing

After the strain of the midyear Exams in February they lived a
freehearted life They had settled into the ways of their world they
had grown used to it and it had grown used to them there was no
longer any ignominy in being a freshman They romped upon the campus
and sometimes rioted harmlessly about the streets of the town In the
evenings they visited their fellows and Brethren and were visited in
turn and sometimes they looked so far ahead as to talk vaguely of their
plans for professions or businessthough to a freshman this concerned
an almost unthinkably distant prospect I guess Ill go in with my
father in the wholesale drug business said Fred My married brother
already is in the firm and I suppose theyll give me a showsend me
out on the road a year or two first maybe to try me Then Im going to
marry some little cutie and settle down What you goin to do Ramsey
Go to Law School and then come back and go in your fathers office

I dont know Guess so

It was always Fred who did most of the talking Ramsey was quiet Fred
told the frat seniors that Ramsey was developing a whole lot these
days and he told Ramsey himself that he could see a big change in
him adding that the improvement was probably due to Ramseys having
passed through terrible trials like that debate

Ramsey kept to their rooms more than his comrade did one reason for
this domesticity being that he had to study longer than Fred did to
keep up and another reason may have been a greater shyness than Fred
possessedif indeed Fred possessed any shyness at all For Fred was
a cheery spirit difficult to abash and by the coming of spring knew all
of the bestlooking girl students in the placeknew them well enough
it appeared to speak of them not merely by their first names but by
abbreviations of these He had become fashions sprig a fusser and
butterfly and he reproached his roommate for shunning the ladies

Well the truth is Fred said Ramsey one day responding
darklywell you see the truth is Fred Ive had aaIve had an
experience

So only did he refer to Milla

Fred said no more and it was comprehended between them that the past
need never be definitely referred to again but that it stood between
Ramsey and any entertainment to be obtained of the gentler but less
trustworthy sex And when other Brethren of the frat would have
pressed Ramsey to join them in various frivolous enterprises concerning
coeds or to be shared by coeds Fred thought it better to explain
to them privately all being sacred among Brethren how Ramseys life
so far as Girls went had been toyed with by one now a Married Woman

This created a great deal of respect for Ramsey It became understood
everywhere that he was a womanhater





Chapter XIV

That early spring of 1915 the two boys and their friends and Brethren
talked more of the war than they had in the autumn though the subject
was not an all at absorbing one for the trenches in Flanders and France
were still of the immense remote distance By no stretch of imagination
could these wet trenches be thought greatly to concern the frat the
Lumen or the university Really important matters were the doings of
the Track Team now training in the Gym and on the Varsity Field
and more vital still the prospects of the Nine But in May there came
a shock which changed things for a time

The _Lusitania_ brought to every American a revelation of what had lain
so deep in his own heart that often he had not realized it was there
When the Germans hid in the sea and sent down the great merchant ship
with American babies and their mothers and gallantly dying American
gentlemen there came a change even to girls and boys and professors
until then so preoccupied with their own little aloof world thousands of
miles from the murder

Fred Mitchell ever volatile and generous was one of those who went
quite wild No orator he nevertheless made a frantic speech at the
weeks frat meetings cursing the Germans in the simple old English
words that their performance had demonstrated to be applicable and
going on to demand that the fraternity prepare for its own share in the
action of the country I dont care _how_ insignificant we few fellows
here tonight may seem he cried we can do our little and if
everybody in this countrys ready to do their own little why thatll
be plenty Brothers dont you realize that all _over_ the United States
tonight the people are feeling just the way we are here Millions and
millions and millions of them Wherever theres an American hes _with_
usand you bet your bottom dollar there are just a few more Americans
in this country of ours than there are bigmouthed lobsters like that
fellow Linski I tell you if Congress only gives the word there could
be an army of five million men in this country tomorrow and those
dirty babykillin dachshunds would hear a word or two from your Uncle
Samuel Brothers I demand that something be done right here and now
and by us I move we telegraph the Secretary of War tonight and offer
him a regiment from this university to go over and help _hang_ their
damn Kaiser

The motion was hotly seconded and instantly carried Then followed
a much flustered discussion of the form and phrasing of the proposed
telegram but after everything seemed to have been settled someone
ascertained by telephone that the telegraph company would not accept
messages containing words customarily defined as profane so the
telegram had to be rewritten This led to further amendment and it was
finally decided to address the senators from that state instead of the
Secretary of War and thus in a somewhat modified form the message was
finally despatched

Next day news of what the frat had done made a great stir in the
university other frats sent telegrams so did the Barbarians
haters of the frats but joining them in this while a small band of
GermanAmerican students found it their duty to go before the faculty
and report these breaches of neutrality They protested heavily
demanding the expulsion of the breachers as disloyal citizens
therefore unfit students but suffered a disappointment for the faculty
itself had been sending telegrams of similar spirit addressing not
only the senators and congressmen of the state but the President of the
United States Flabbergasted the GermanAmericans retired they were
confused and disgusted by this higherup outbreak of unneutralityit
overwhelmed them that citizens of the United States should not remain
neutral in the dispute between the United States and Germany All day
the campus was in ferment

At twilight Ramsey was walking meditatively on his way to dinner at
the frat house across the campus from his apartment at Mrs Meigs
Everybody was quiet now both town and gown the students were at their
dinners and so were the burghers Ramsey was late but did not quicken
his thoughtful steps which were those of one lost in reverie He had
forgotten that springtime was all about him and with his head down
walked unregardful of the new gayeties flung forth upon the air by great
clusters of flowering shrubs just come into white blossom and lavender

He was unconscious that somebody behind him going the same way
came hastening to overtake him and called his name Ramsey Ramsey
Milholland Not until he had been called three times did he realize
that he was being hailedand in a girls voice By that time the girl
herself was beside him and Ramsey halted quite taken aback The girl
was Dora Yocum

She was pale a little breathless and her eyes were bright and severe
I want to speak to you she said quickly I want to ask you about
something Mr Colburn and Fred Mitchell are the only people I know in
your frat except you and I havent seen either of them today or Id
have asked one of them

Most uncomfortably astonished Ramsey took his hands out of his pockets
picked a leaf from a lilac bush beside the path and put the stem of the
leaf seriously into a corner of his mouth before finding anything to
say Wellwell all right he finally responded Ill tell youif
its anything I know about

You know about it said Dora That is you certainly do if you were
at your frat meeting last night Were you

Yes I was there Ramsey answered wondering what in the world she
wanted to know though he supposed vaguely that it must be something
about Colburn whom he had several times seen walking with her Of
course I couldnt tell you much he added with an afterthought You
see a good deal that goes on at a frat meeting isnt supposed to be
talked about

Yes she said smiling faintly though with a satire that missed him
Ive been a member of a sorority since September and I think I have an
idea of what could be told or not told Suppose we walk on if you dont
mind My question neednt embarrass you

Nevertheless as they slowly went on together Ramsey was embarrassed
He felt queer They had known each other so long in a way had shared
so much sitting daily for years near each other and undergoing the same
outward experiences they had almost grown up together yet this was
the first time they had ever talked together or walked together

Well he said If you want to ask anything its all right for me to
tell youwell I just as soon I guess

It has nothing to do with the secret proceedings of your frat said
Dora primly What I want to ask about has been talked of all over the
place today Everyone has been saying it was _your_ frat that sent
the first telegram to members of the Government offering support in case
of war with Germany They say you didnt even wait until today but
sent off a message last night What I wanted to ask you was whether this
story is true or not

Why yes said Ramsey mildly Thats what we did

She uttered an exclamation a sound of grief and of suspicion confirmed
Ah I was afraid so

Afraid so Whats the matter he asked and because she seemed
excited and troubled he found himself not quite so embarrassed as he
had been at first for some reason her agitation made him feel easier
What was wrong about that

Oh its all so shocking and wicked and mistaken she cried Even the
faculty has been doing it and half the other frats and sororities
And it was yours that started it

Yes we did he said throughly puzzled Were the oldest frat
here and of coursehe chuckled modestlyof course we think were
the best Do you mean you believe we ought tove sat back and let
somebody else start it

Oh _no_ she answered vehemently Nobody ought to have started it
Thats the trouble dont you see If nobody had started it none of it
might have happened The rest mightnt have caught it It mightnt have
got into their heads A war thought is the most contagious thought in
the world but if it can be kept from starting it can be kept from
being contagious Its just when people have got into an emotional
state or a state of smouldering rage that everybody ought to be so
terribly careful not to think war thoughts or make war speechesor send
war telegrams I thoughtoh I was so sure Id convinced Mr Colburn of
all this the last time we talked of it He seemed to understand and I
was sure he agreed with me She bit her lip He was only pretendingI
see that now

I guess he must a been said Ramsey with admirable simplicity He
didnt talk about anything like that last night He was as much for it
as anybody

Ive no doubt

Ramsey made bold to look at her out of the side of his eye and as she
was gazing tensely forward he continued his observation for some time
She was obviously controlling agitation almost controlling tears which
seemed to threaten her very wideopen eyes for those now fully
grown and noticeable eyewinkers of hers were subject to fluctuations
indicating such a threat She looked hurt and Ramsey was touched
there was something human about her then after all And if he had put
his feeling into words at the moment he would have said that he guessed
maybe he could stand this ole girl for a few minutes sometimes better
than hed always thought he could

Well he said Colburn probly wouldnt want to hurt your feelings or
anything Colburn

He He didnt I havent the faintest personal interest in what he
did

Oh said Ramsey Well excuse me I thought probly you were sore
because hed jollied you about this pacifist stuff and then

No she said sharply Im not thinking of his having agreed with
_me_ and fooling _me_ about it He just wanted to make a pleasant
impression on a girl and said anything he thought would please her I
dont care whether he does things like that or not What I care about
is that the _principle_ didnt reach him and that he mocked it I dont
care about a petty treachery to me personally but I

Fraternal loyalty could not quite brook this Brother Colburn is a
perfectly honorble man said Ramsey solemnly He is one of the most
honorble men in this

Of course she cried Oh cant I make you understand that Im not
condemning him for a little flattery to me I dont care two straws
for his showing that _I_ didnt influence him He doesnt interest me
please understand

Ramsey was altogether perplexed Well I dont see what makes you go
for him so hard then

I dont

But you said he was treach

I dont _condemn_ him for it she insisted despairingly Dont you
see the difference Im not condemning anybody Im only lamenting

What about

About all of you that want _war_

My golly Ramsey exclaimed You dont think those Dutchmen were right
to drown babies and

No I think they were ghastly murderers I think they were detestable
and fiendish and monstrous and

Well then my goodness What do you want

I dont want war

You dont

I want Christianity she cried I cant think of the Germans without
hating them and so today when all the world is hating them I keep
myself from thinking of them as much as I can Already half the world is
full of war you want to go to war to make things right but it wont
it will only make more war

Well I

Dont you see what youve done you boys she said Dont you see
what youve done with your absurd telegram That started the rest they
thought they _all_ had to send telegrams like that

Well the faculty

Even they mightnt have thought of it if it hadnt been for the first
one Vengeance is the most terrible thought once you put it into
peoples minds that they ought to have it it runs away with them

Well it isnt mostly vengeance were after at all Theres a lot more
to it than just getting even with

She did not heed him Youre all blind You dont see what youre
doing you dont even see what youve done to this peaceful place here
Youve filled it full of thoughts of fury and killing and massacre

Why no said Ramsey It was those Dutch did that to us and
besides theres more to it than you

No there isnt she interrupted Its just the old brutal spirit
that nations inherit from the time they were only tribes its the tribe
spirit and an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth Its those things
and the love of fightingmen have always loved to fight Civilization
hasnt taken it out of them men still have the brute in them that loves
to fight

I dont think so said Ramsey Americans dont love to fight I dont
know about other countries but we dont Of course here and there
theres some fellow that likes to hunt around for scrapes but I never
saw more than three or four in my life that acted that way Of course a
football team often has a scrapper or two on it but thats different

No she said I think you all really love to fight

Ramsey was roused to become argumentative I dont see where you get
the idea Colburn isnt that way and back at school there wasnt a
single boy that was anything like that

What She stopped and turned suddenly to face him

Whats the matter he said stopping too Something he said had
startled her evidently

How can you say such a thing she cried _You_ love to fight

Me

You do You love fighting You always have loved fighting

He was dumbfounded Why I never had a fight in my life

She cried out in protest of such prevarication

Well I never did he insisted mildly

Why you had a fight about _me_

No I didnt

With Wesley Bender

Ramsey chuckled _That_ wasnt a fight

It wasnt

Nothing like one We were just guyin him aboutabout gettin slicked
up kind of because he sat in front of you and he hit me with his book
strap and I chased him off Gracious no _that_ wasnt a fight

But you fought Linski only last fall

Ramsey chuckled again That wasnt even as much like a fight as the one
with Wesley I just told this Linski I was goin to give him a punch in
the sn I just told him to look out because I was goin to hit him and
then I did it and waited to see if he wanted to do anything about it
and he didnt Thats all there was to it and it wasnt any more like
fighting thanthan feeding chickens is

She laughed dolefully It seems to me rather more like it than that

Well it wasnt

They had begun to walk on again and Ramsey was aware that they had
passed the frat house where his dinner was probably growing cold He
was aware of this but not sharply or insistently Curiously enough he
did not think about it He had begun to find something pleasant in the
odd interview and in walking beside a girl even though the girl was
Dora Yocum He made no attempt to account to himself for anything so
peculiar

For a while they went slowly together not speaking and without
destination though Ramsey vaguely took it for granted that Dora was
going somewhere But she wasnt They emerged from the part of the
small town closely built about the university and came out upon a bit
of parked land overlooking the river and here Doras steps slowed to an
indeterminate halt near a bench beneath a maple tree

I think Ill stay here a while she said and as he made no response
she asked Hadnt you better be going back to your frat house for
your dinner I didnt mean for you to come out of your way with me I
only wanted to get an answer to my question Youd better be running
back

Well

He stood irresolute not sure that he wanted his dinner just then It
would have amazed him to face the fact deliberately that perhaps he
preferred being with Dora Yocum to eating However he faced no such
fact nor any fact but lingered

Well he said again

Youd better go

I guess I can get my dinner pretty near any time I dont He had a
thought Did you

Did I what

Did you have your dinner before I met you

No

Well arent you

She shook her head I dont want any

Why not

I dont think people have very much appetite today and yesterday she
said with the hint of a sad laugh all over America

No I guess thats so

Its too terrible she said I cant sit and eat when I think of the
_Lusitania_of all those poor poor people strangling in the water

No I guess nobody can eat much if they think about that

And of what its going to bring if we let it she went on As if
this killing werent enough we want to add _our_ killing Oh thats
the most terrible thing of allthe thing it makes within us Dont you
understand

She turned to him appealingly and he felt queerer than ever Dusk had
fallen Where they stood under the youngleaved maple tree there
was but a faint lingering of afterglow and in this mystery her face
glimmered wan and sweet so that Ramsey just then was like one who
discovers an old pan used in the kitchen to be made of chased silver

Well I dont feel much like dinner right now he said Wewe could
sit here awhile on this bench probly





Chapter XV

Ramsey kept very few things from Fred Mitchell and usually his
confidences were immediate upon the occasion of them but allowed
several weeks to elapse before sketching for his roommate the outlines
of this adventure

One thing that was kind o funny about it Fred he said I didnt
know what to call her

Mr Mitchell stretched upon the window seat in their study and
looking out over the town street below and the campus beyond the street
had already thought it tactful to ambush his profound amusement by
turning upon his side so that his face was toward the window and away
from his companion What did you want to call her he inquired in a
serious voice Names

No You know what I mean I mean I had to just keep callin her you
and that gets kind of freaky when youre talkin to anybody a good while
like that When shed be lookin away from me and Id want to start
sayin something to her you know why I wouldnt know how to get
started exactly without callin her something A person doesnt want to
be always startin off with See here or things like that

I dont see why you let it trouble you said Fred From how youve
always talked about her you had a perfectly handy way to start off with
anything you wanted to say to her

What with

Why didnt you just say Oh you Teachers Pet That would

Get out What I mean is she called me Ramsey without any bother it
seems funny I got stumped every time I started to say Dora Someway I
couldnt land it and it certainly would a sounded crazy to call her
Miss Yocum after sittin in the same room with her every day from the
baby class clear on up through the end of high school That _would_ a
made me out an idiot

What did you call her Fred asked

Just nothin at all I started to call her something or other a hundred
times I guess and then Id balk Id get all ready and kind of make a
sort of a sound and then Id have to quit

She may have thought you had a cold said Fred still keeping his back
turned

I expect maybe she didthough I dont know most of the time she
didnt seem to notice me much kind of

She didnt

No She was too upset I guess by what she was thinkin about

But if it hadnt been for that Fred suggested you mean shed have
certainly paid more attention to who was sitting on the bench with her

Get out You know how it was Everybody those few days thought we were
goin to have war and she was just sure of it and it upset her Of
course most people were a lot more upset by what those Dutchmen did
to the _Lusitania_ than by the idea of war and she seemed to feel as
broken up as anybody could be about the _Lusitania_ but what got her
the worst was the notion of her country wantin to fight she said She
really was upset too Fred there wasnt any puttin on about it I
guess that ole girl certainly must have a good deal of feeling because
doggoned after wed been sittin there a while if she didnt have to
get out her handkerchief She kept her face turned away from mejust
the same as youre doin now to keep from laughinbut honestly she
cried like somebody at a funeral I felt like the darndest fool

Im not laughing said Fred but he did not prove it by turning so
that his face could be seen What did she say

Oh she didnt say such an awful lot She said one kind o funny thing
though she said she was sorry she couldnt quite control herself but
if anybody had to see her cry she minded it less because it was an old
schoolmate What struck me so kind o funny about that iswhy it looks
as if she never knew the way I always hated her so

Yes said Fred It wasnt flattering

Well sir it _isnt_ kind of Ramsey agreed musingly It certainly
isnt when you look at it that way

What did you say when she said that Fred asked

Nothin I started to but I sort of balked again Well we kept on
sitting there and afterwhile she began to talk again and got kind of
excited about how no war could do anything or anybody any good and all
war was wicked no matter what it was about and nothin could be good
that was founded on fear and hate and every war that ever was fought
was always founded on fear and hate She said if the Germans wanted to
fight us we ought to go to meet them and tell them we wouldnt fight

What did you say

Nothin I kind o started tobut whats the use Shes got that
in her head Besides how are you goin to argue about a thing with
a person thats crying about it I tell you Fred I guess we got to
admit after all that ole girl certainly must have a lots of heart
about her anyway There may not be much _fun_ to herthough of course
I wouldnt know hardly any way to tell about thatbut there couldnt be
hardly any doubt shes got a lot of feeling Well and then she went on
and said old men made wars but didnt fight they left the fighting to
the boys and the suffering to the boys mothers

Yes Fred exclaimed and upon that he turned free of mirth for the
moment Thats the woman of it I guess Send the old men to do the
fighting For the matter of that I guess my fatherd about a thousand
times go himself than see me and my brothers go but Fathers so fat he
cant stoop You got to be able to stoop to dig a trench I guess Well
suppose we sent our old men up against those Dutchmen the Dutchmen
would just kill the old men and then come after the boys anyway and
the boys wouldnt be ready and theyd get killed too and then there
wouldnt be anybody but the Dutchmen left and thatd be one fine world
wouldnt it

Yes said Ramsey Course I thought of that

Did you tell her

No

What did you say

Nothin I couldnt get started anyway but besides what was the use
But she didnt want the old men to go she didnt want anybody to go

What did she want the country to do Fred asked impatiently

Just what it has been doin I suppose Just let things simmer down
and poke along and let them do what they like to us

I guess so said Fred Then afterwhile when they get some free time
on their hands theyll come over and make it _really_ interesting for
us because they know we wont do anything but talk Yes I guess the
way things are settling down ought to suit Dora There isnt goin to be
any war

She was pretty sure there was though Ramsey said thoughtfully

Oh of course she was then We all thought so those few days

No She said she thought it probly wouldnt come right away but now
it was almost sure to come sometime She said our telegrams and all the
talk and so much feeling and everything showed her that the war thought
that was always _in_ people somewhere had been stirred up so it would
go on and on She said she knew from the way she felt herself about the
_Lusitania_ that a feeling like that in her would never be absolutely
wiped out as long as she lived But she said her other feeling about the
horribleness of war taught her to keep the first feeling from breaking
out but with other people it wouldnt and even if war didnt break
out right then it would always be ready to all over the country and
sometime it would though she was goin to do her share to fight it
herself as long as she could stand She asked me wouldnt I be one of
the ones to help her

He paused and after a moment Fred asked Well What did you say to
that

Nothin I started to but

Again Fred thought it tactful to turn and look out the window while the
agitation of his shoulders betrayed him

Go on and laugh Well so we stayed there quite a while but before we
left she got kind of more like everyday you know the way people do It
was halfpast nine when we walked back in town and I was commencin
to feel kind of hungry so I asked her if she wasnt and she sort of
laughed and seemed to be ashamed of it as if it were a disgrace or
something but she said she guessed she was so I left her by that hedge
of lilacs near the observatory and went on over to the Teria and the
fruit store and got some stuffed eggs and olives and halfadozen
peanut butter sandwiches and a box o strawberrieskind of girlfood
you knowand went on back there and we ate the stuff up So then she
said she was afraid shed taken me away from my dinner and made me a lot
of trouble and so on and she was sorry and she told me goodnight

What did you say then

Noth Oh shut up So then she skipped out to her Dorm and I came on
home

When did you see her next Ramsey

I havent seen her next said Ramsey I havent seen her at allnot
to speak to I saw her on Main Street twice since then but both times
she was with some other girls and they were across the street and
I couldnt tell if she was lookin at meI kind of thought notso I
thought it might look sort o nutty to bow to her if she wasnt so I
didnt

And you didnt tell her you wouldnt be one of the ones to help her
with her pacifism and antiwar stuff and all that

No I started to but Shut up

Fred sat up giggling So she thinks you _will_ help her You didnt
say anything at all and she must think that means she converted you
Why didnt you speak up

Well _I_ wouldnt argue with her said Ramsey Then after a silence
he seemed to be in need of sympathetic comprehension It _was_ kind o
funny though wasnt it he said appealingly

What was

The whole business

What whole bus

Oh get out Her stoppin me and me goin pokin along with her and
herwell her crying and everything and me being around with her while
she felt so upset I mean It seemswell it does seem kind o funny to
me

Why does it Fred inquired preserving his gravity Why should it
seem funny to you

I dont mean funny like somethings funny you laugh at Ramsey
explained laboriously I mean funny like something thats out of the
way and you wonder how it ever happened to happen I mean it seems
funny Id ever be sittin there on a bench with that ole girl I never
spoke to in my life or had anything to do with and talkin about the
United States goin to war What we were talkin about why that seems
just as funny as the rest of it Lookin back to our class picnic fr
instance second year of high school that day I jumped in the creek
after Well you know it was when I started makin a fool of myself
over a girl Thank goodness I got _that_ out o my system it makes me
just sick to look back on those days and think of the fool things I did
and all I thought about that girl Why she Well Ive got old enough
to see now she was just about as ordinary a girl as there ever was and
if I saw her now I wouldnt even think she was pretty Id probly think
she was sort of loudlookin Well whats passed is past and it isnt
either here nor there What I started to say was this that the way it
begins to look to me it looks as if nobody can tell in this life a darn
thing about whats goin to happen and the things that do happen are
the very ones youd swear were the last that could I meanyou look
back to that day of the picnicmy but I was a rube thenwell I mean
you look back to that day and what do you suppose Id have thought then
if somebodyd told me the time would ever come when Id be way off here
at college sittin on a bench with Dora Yocumwith _Dora Yocum_ in
the first placeand her crying and both of us talking about the United
States goin to war with Germany Dont it seem pretty funny to you
Fred too

But as near as I can make out Fred said that isnt what happened

Why isnt it

You say and both us talking and so on As near as I can make out
_you_ didnt say anything at all

Well I didntmuch Ramsey admitted and returned to his point with
almost pathetic persistence But doesnt it seem kind o funny to you
Fred

Well I dont know

It does to me Ramsey insisted It certainly does to me

Yes said Fred cruelly Ive noticed you said so but it dont look
any funnier than you do when you say it

Suddenly he sent forth a startling shout _Wow_ Youre as red as a
blushing beet

I am not

Yare shouted Fred Wow The ole womanhaters got the flushes Oh
look at the pretty posy

And jumping down from the window seat he began to dance round his much
perturbed comrade bellowing Ramsey bore with him for a moment then
sprang upon him they wrestled vigorously broke a chair and went to
the floor with a crash that gave the chandelier in Mrs Meigs parlour
below an attack of jingles

You let me up Fred gasped

You take your solemn oath to shut up You goin to swear it

All right I give my solemn oath said Fred and they rose arranging
their tousled attire

Well said Fred when you goin to call on her

You look here Ramsey approached him dangerously You just gave me
your sol

I beg Fred cried retreating I mean aside from all that why I
just thought maybe after such an evening youd feel as a gentleman you
ought to go and ask about her health

Now see here

No I mean it you ought to Fred insisted earnestly and as
his roommate glared at him with complete suspicion he added in
explanation You ought to go next Callers Night and send in your
card and say you felt you ought to ask if shed suffered any from the
night air Even if you couldnt manage to say that you ought to start
to say it anyhow because you Keep off o me Im only tryin to do
you a good turn aint I

You save your good turns for yourself Ramsey growled still advancing
upon him

But the insidious Mitchell evading him fled to the other end of the
room picked up his cap and changed his manner Come on ole bag o
beans lets be on our way to the frat house its time Well call
this all off

You better Ramsey warned him and they trotted out together

But as they went along Fred took Ramseys arm confidentially and said
Now honestly Ram ole man when _are_ you goin to

Ramsey was still red You look here Just say one more word

Oh _no_ Fred expostulated I mean _seriously_ Ramsey Honestly I
mean seriously Arent you seriously goin to call on her some Callers
Night

No Im not

But why not

Because I dont want to

Well seriously Ramsey theres only one Callers Night before
vacation and so I suppose it hardly will be worth while but I expect
youll see quite a little of her at home this summer

No I wont I wont see her at all She isnt goin to be home this
summer and I wouldnt see anything of her if she was

Wheres she goin to be

In Chicago

She is said Fred slyly Whend she tell you

Ramsey turned on him You look out She didnt tell me I just happened
to see in the _Bulletin_ shes signed up with some other girls to go and
do settlement work in Chicago Anybody could see it It was printed out
plain You could have seen it just as well as I could if youd read the
_Bulletin_

Oh said Fred

Now look here

Good heavens Cant I even say oh

It depends on the way you say it

Ill be careful Fred assured him earnestly I really and honestly
dont mean to get you excited about all this Ramsey I can see myself
you havent changed from your old opinion of Dora Yocum a bit I was
only tryin to get a little rise out of you for a minute because of
course seriously why I can see you hate her just the same as you
always did

Yes said Ramsey disarmed and guileless in the face of diplomacy I
only told you about all this Fred because it seemedwell it seemed
so kind o funny to me

Fred affected not to hear What did you say Ramsey

Ramsey looked vaguely disturbed I saidwhy I said it all seemed kind
o He paused then repeated plaintively Well to me it all seemed
kind okind o funny

What did Fred inquired but as he glanced in seeming naivete at his
companion something he saw in the latters eye warned him and suddenly
Fred thought it would be better to run

Ramsey chased him all the way to the frat house





Chapter XVI

Ramsey was not quite athlete enough for any of the varsity teams
neither was he an antagonist safely encountered whether in play or
in earnest and during the next few days he taught Fred Mitchell to be
cautious The chaffer learned that his own agility could not save him
from Ramsey and so found it wiser to contain an effervescence which
sometimes threatened to burst him Ramsey as a victim was a continuous
temptation he was so goodnatured and yet so furious

After Commencement when the roommates had gone home Mr Mitchells
caution extended over the long sunshiny months of summer vacation he
broke it but once and then in welladvised safety for the occasion was
semipublic The two were out for a stroll on a July Sunday afternoon
and up and down the street young couples lolled along young families
and baby carriages straggled to and from the houses of older relatives
and the rest of the world of that growing city was rocking and fanning
itself on its front veranda

Heres a right pretty place isnt it Ramsey dont you think Fred
remarked innocently as they were passing a lawn of shortclipped
bright green grass before a geniallooking house fresh in white paint
and cool in greenandwhite awnings A broad veranda well populated
just now crossed the front of the house fine trees helped the awnings
to give comfort against the sun and Freds remark was warranted
Nevertheless he fell under the suspicion of his companion who had
begun to evince some nervousness before Fred spoke

What place do you mean

The Yocum place said Mr Mitchell I hear the old gentlemans mighty
prosperous these days They keep things up to the mark dont they
Ramsey

I dont know whether they do or whether they dont Ramsey returned
shortly

Fred appeared to muse regretfully It looks kind of _empty_ now
though he said with only Mr and Mrs Yocum and their three married
daughters and eight or nine children on the front porch

You wait till I get you where they cant see us Ramsey warned him
fiercely

You cant do it said Fred manifesting triumph Well both stop
right here in plain sight of the whole Yocum family connection till you
promise not to touch me

And he halted leaning back implacably against the Yocums iron fence
Ramsey was scandalized

Come on he said hoarsely Dont stop _here_

I will and if you go on alone Ill yell at you You got to stand right
here with all of em lookin at you until

I promise My heavens come _on_

Fred consented to end the moment of agony and for the rest of the
summer found it impossible to persuade Ramsey to pass that house in his
company I wont do it Ramsey told him Your word of honour means
nothin to me youre liable to do anything that comes into your head
and Im gettin old enough to not get a reputation for bein seen with
people that act the idiot on the public streets No sir well walk
around the blockat least we will if youre goin with _me_

And to Freds delight though he concealed it they would make this
detour

The evening after their return to the university both were busy with
their trunks and various orderings and disorderings of their apartment
but Fred several times expressed surprise that his roommate should
be content to remain at home and finally Ramsey comprehended the
implications Mrs Meigss chandelier immediately jingled with the shock
of another crash upon the floor above

You let me up Fred commanded thickly his voice muffled by the pile
of flannels sweaters underwear and raincoats wherein his head
was being forced to burrow You let me up darn you _I_ didnt say
anything And upon his release he complained that the attack was
unprovoked I didnt say anything on earth to even hint you might want
to go out and look around to see if anybody in particular had got back
to college yet I didnt even mention the _name_ of Dora Yo Keep off
o me My goodness but you are sensitive

As a matter of fact neither of them saw Dora until the first meeting of
the Lumen whither they went as sophomores to take their pleasure in the
agony of freshmen debaters Ramsey was now able to attend the Lumen not
with complacence but at least without shuddering over the recollection
of his own spectacular first appearance there He had made subsequent
appearances far from brilliant yet not disgraceful and as a spectator
at least he usually felt rather at his ease in the place It cannot be
asserted however that he appeared entirely at his ease this evening
after he had read the Programme chalked upon the large easel
blackboard beside the chairmans desk Three Freshmen Debates were
announced and a Sophomore Oration this last being followed by the
name D Yocum 18 Ramsey made immediate and conspicuous efforts
to avoid sitting next to his roommate but was not so adroit as to be
successful However Fred was merciful the fluctuations of his friends
complexion were an inspiration more to pity than to badinage

The three debates all concerned the Causes of the War in Europe and
honours appeared to rest with a small and stout stolidly proGerman
girl debater who had brought with her and translated at sight absaloot
proofs so she called them printed in German that Germany had been
attacked by Belgium at the low instigation of the envious English
Everybody knew it wasnt true but she made an impression and
established herself as a debater especially as her opponent was quite
confounded by her introduction of printed matter

When the debates and the verdicts were concluded the orator appeared
and Freds compassion extended itself so far that he even refrained from
looking inquisitively at the boy in the seat next to his but he made
one side wager mentallythat if Ramsey had consented to be thoroughly
confidential just then he would have confessed to feeling kind o
funny

Dora was charmingly dressed and she was pale but those notable
eyelashes of hers were all the more notable against her pallor And as
she spoke with fire it was natural that her colour should come back
quite flamingly and that her eyes should flash in shelter of the lashes
The Christian Spirit and Internationalism was her subject yet she
showed no meek sample of a Christian Spirit herself when she came to
attacking warmakers generally as well as all those halfdeveloped
tribesmen and victims of herd instinct who believed that war might
ever be justified under any circumstances of atrocity She was eloquent
truly and a picture of grace and girlish dignity even when she
was most vigorous Nothing could have been more militant than her
denunciation of militancy

Shes an actual wonder Fred said when the two had got back to Mrs
Meigss afterward Dont you look at me like that Im talkin about
her as a public character and theres nothin personal about it You
let me alone

Ramsey was not clear as to his duty Well

If any person makes a public speech Fred protested I got a perfect
right to discuss em no matter what you think of emand he added
hastilyor _dont_ think of em

Look here

Good heavens Fred exclaimed You arent expecting to interfere with
me if I say anything about that little fat Werder girl that argued for
Germany are you Or any of the other speakers I got a right to talk
about em just as public speakers havent I Well what I say is
Dora Yocum as an orator is just an actual perfect wonder Got any
objections

Nno

All right then Fred settled himself upon the window seat with a pipe
and proceeded Theres something about her when she stands there she
stands so straight and knows just what shes up to and everything why
theres something about her makes the cold chills go down your
spineI mean _my_ spine not yours particularly You sit downI
mean _anybodys_ spine doggone it And as Ramsey increased the
manifestations of his suspicions lifting a tennis racket over the
prostrate figure Oh murder Fred said resignedly All right well
change the subject That fat little Werder cutie made out a pretty good
case for Germany didnt she

Ramsey tossed the racket away disposed himself in an easy chair with
his feet upon the table and presently chuckled You remember the time
I had the fuss with Wesley Bender back in the ole school days

Yep

All the flubdub this Werder girl got off tonight puts me in mind of
the way I talked that day I can remember it as well as anything Wesley
kept yelpin that whoever mentioned a ladys name in a public place was
a pup and of course I didnt want to hit him for that a boys got
a reglar instinct for tryin to make out hes on the right side in a
scrap and hell always try to do something or say something or hell
get the other boy to say someting to make it look as if the other boy
was in the wrong and began the trouble So I told poor ole Wes that my
father spoke my mothers name in a public place whenever he wanted
to and I dared him to say my father was a pup And all so on A boy
startin up a scrap why half the time hell drag his father and mother
if theres any chance to do it Hell fix up some way so he can say
Well thats just the same as if you called my father and mother a
fool or something like that Then afterward he can claim he was
scrappin because he had to defend his father and mother and of course
hell more than half believe it himself

Well you take a Governmentits only just some _men_ the way I see
it and if theyre goin to start some big trouble like this war why
of course theyll play just about the same ole boy trick because its
instinct to do it just the same for a man as it is for a boyor else
the principles just the same or something Well anyhow if you want
to know who started a scrap and worked it up you got to forget all the
_talk_ there is about it and all what each side _says_ and just look
at two things Who was fixed for it first or thought they were and who
hit first When you get the answer to those two questions everythings
settled about all this being attacked business Both sides just the
same as boys theyll both claim they _had_ to fight but if you want to
know which one _did_ have to why forget all the arguing and dont take
your eye off just what _happened_ As near as I can make out this
war began with Germany and Austria startin in to wipe out two little
countries Austria began shootin up Serbia and Germany began shootin
up Belgium I dont need to notice any more than that myselfall
the Werder girls in the country can debate their heads off they cant
change what happened and they cant excuse it either

He was silent appearing to feel that he had concluded conclusively and
the young gentleman on the window seat after staring at him for several
moments of genuine thoughtfulness was gracious enough to observe
Well ole Ram you may be a little slow in class but when you think
things out with yourself you do show signs of something pretty near like
real horsesense sometimes Why dont you ever say anything like that
toto some of your pacifist friends

What do you mean Who you talkin about Whose pacifist friends

See here Fred exclaimed as Ramsey seemed about to rise You keep
sitting just where you are and dont look at me out of the side of your
eye like thatpretendin youre a bad horse Im _really_ serious now
and you listen to me I dont think argufying and debating like that
little Fraulein Werders does much harm Shes a right nifty young
rolypoly by the way though you didnt notice of course

Why didnt I Ramsey demanded sharply Why didnt I notice

Oh nothing But as I was saying I dont think that sort of talk does
much harm everybody knows it goes on among the proGermans and its
all hot air anyhow But I think Linskis sort of talk does do harm
probly among people that dont know much and whats more I think Dora
Yocums does some too Well you hit Linski in the snoot so what are
you Sit still My lord You dont think Im askin you to go and hit
Dora do you I mean Arent you ever goin to talk to her about it and
tell her whats what

Oh you go on to bed

No Im in earnest Fred urged Honestly arent you ever goin to

How could I do anything like that Ramsey demanded explosively I
never see herto speak to that is I probly wont happen to have
another talk with her or anything all the time were in college

No Fred admitted I suppose not Of course if you did then you
would give her quite a talkingto just the way you did the other time
wouldnt you But upon that another resumption of physical violence
put an end to the conversation





Chapter XVII

Throughout the term Ramseys calculation of probabilities against the
happening of another interview with Dora seemed to be well founded but
at the beginning of the second semester he found her to be a fellow
member of a class in biology More than that this class had every week
a twohour session in the botanical laboratory where the structure of
plants was studied under microscopic dissection The students worked in
pairs a special family of plants being assigned to each couple and the
instructor selected the couples with an eye to combinations of the quick
with the slow D Yocum and R Milholland the latter in a strange state
of mind and complexion were given two chairs but only one desk and one
microscope Their conversation was strictly botanical

Thenceforth it became the most pressing care of Ramseys life to prevent
his roommate from learning that there was any conversation at all even
botanical Fortunately Fred was not taking the biological courses
though he appeared to be taking the sentimental ones with an astonishing
thoroughness and sometimes to Freds hilarious delight Ramsey
attempted to turn the tables and rally him upon whatever last affair
seemed to be engaging his fancy The old Victorian and preVictorian
_blague_ word petticoat had been revived in Freds vocabulary and in
others as skirt The lightsome sprig was hourly to be seen even
when university rulings forbade dillydallying giddily along the campus
paths or the town sidewalks with some new and pretty Skirt And when
Ramsey tried to fluster him about such a matter Fred would profess his
ardent love for the new lady in shouts and impromptu song Nothing
could be done to him and Ramsey utterly unable to defend his own
sensibilities in like manner had always to retire in bafflement
Sometimes he would ponder upon the question thus suggested Why couldnt
he do this sort of thing since Fred could But he never discovered a
satisfying answer

Ramseys watchfulness was so careful lest he make some impulsive
admission in regard to the botanical laboratory for instance that
Mr Mitchells curiosity gradually became almost quiescent but
there arrived a day in February when it was piqued into the liveliest
activity It was Sunday and Fred dressing with a fastidiousness
ever his daily habit noticed that Ramsey was exhibiting an unusual
perplexity about neckties

Keep the black one on Fred said volunteering the suggestion as
Ramsey muttered fiercely at a mirror Its in better taste for church
anyhow Youre going to church arent you

Yes Are you

No Ive got a luncheon engagement

Well you could go to church first couldnt you You better youve
got a lot of church absences against you

Then one more wont hurt No church in mine this morning thanks Gby
ole sox see you at the frat house for dinner

He went forth whistling syncopations and began a brisk trudge into the
open country There was a professors daughter who also was not going to
church that morning and she lived a little more than three miles
beyond the outskirts of the town Unfortunately as the weather was
threatening all others of her family abandoned the idea of church that
day and Fred found her before a cozy fire but surrounded by parents
little brothers and big sisters The professor was talkative Freds
mind might have been greatly improved but with a window in range he
preferred a melancholy contemplation of the snow which had begun
to fall in quantity The professor talked until luncheon throughout
luncheon and was well under way to fill the whole afternoon with talk
when Fred repenting all the errors of his life got up to go

Heartily urged to remain for there was now something just under a
blizzard developing he said No he had a great deal of cirriculum
work to get done before the morrow and passed from the sound of
the professors hospitable voice and into the storm He had a tedious
struggle against the wind and thickening snow but finally came in
sight of the town not long before dark Here the road led down into a
depression and lifting his head as he began the slight ascent on the
other side Fred was aware of two figures outlined upon the low ridge
before him They were dimmed by the driving snow and their backs were
toward him but he recognized them with perfect assurance They were
Dora Yocum and Ramsey Milholland

They were walking so slowly that their advance was almost imperceptible
but it could be seen that Dora was talking with great animation and
she was a graceful thing thus gesticulating in her long slim fur coat
with the white snow frosting her brown fur cap Ramsey had his hands
deep in his overcoat pockets and his manner was wholly that of an
audience

Fred murmured to himself What did you say to her Nothin I
started to but Then he put on a burst of speed and passed them
sweeping off his hat with operatic deference yet hurrying by as if
fearful of being thought a killjoy if he lingered He went to the
frat house found no one downstairs and established himself in a red
leather chair to smoke and ruminate merrily by a great fire in the hall

Half an hour later Ramsey entered stamped off the snow hung up his hat
and coat and sat himself down defiantly in the red leather chair on the
other side of the fireplace

Well go on he said Commence

Not at all Fred returned amiably Fine spring weather today
Lovely to see all the flowers and the birds as we go astrolling by The
little bobolinks

You look here Thats the only walk I ever took with her in my life I
mean byby asking her and her saying she would and so forth That other
time just sort of happened and you know it Well the weather wasnt
just the best in the world maybe but shes an awful conscientious girl
and once she makes an engagement

Why of course Fred finished for him Shed be too pious to break
it just on account of a mere little blizzard or anything Wonder how the
weather will be next Sunday

I dont know and I dont care said Ramsey You dont suppose I asked
her to go _again_ do you

Why not

Well for one thing you dont suppose I want her to think Im a
perfect fool do you

Fred mused a moment or two looking at the fire What was the lecture
he asked mildly

What lecture

She seemed to me to be

That wasnt lecturing she was just

Just what

Well she thinks war for the United States is coming closer and
closer

But it isnt

Well she thinks so anyhow said Ramsey and shes all broken up
about it Of course she thinks we oughtnt to fight and shes trying to
get everybody else she can to keep working against it She isnt goin
home again next summer shes goin back to that settlement work in
Chicago and work there among those people against our goin to war and
here in college she wants to get everybody she can to talk against it
and

What did you say Fred asked and himself supplied the reply
Nothin I started to but

Ramsey got up Now look here You know the frat passed a rule that if
we broke any more furniture in this house with our scrappin wed both
be fined the cost of repairs and five dollars apiece Well I can afford
five dollars this month better than you can and

I take it back Fred interposed hastily But you just listen to me
you look outletting her think youre on her side like that

I dont

You _dont_

Ramsey looked dogged Im not goin around always arguin about
everything when arguin would just hurt peoples feelings about
something theyre all excited about and wouldnt do a bit o good
in the worldand you know yourself just _talk_ hardly ever settles
anythingso I dont

Aha Fred cried I thought so Now you listen to me

I wont I

But at this moment they were interrupted Someone slyly opened the door
and a snowball deftly thrown from without caught Ramsey upon the back
of the neck and head where it flattened and displayed itself as an
ornamental star Shouting fiercely both boys sprang up ran to the
door were caught there in a barrage of snowballs ducked through it in
spite of all damage charged upon a dozen besweatered figures awaiting
them and began a mad battle in the blizzard Some of their opponents
treacherously joined them and turned upon the ambushers

In the dusk the merry conflict waged up and down the snowcovered
lawn and the combatants threw and threw or surged back and forth or
clenched and toppled over into snow banks yet all coming to chant an
extemporized battlecry in chorus even as they fought the most wildly

Who Who Who they chanted Who Who _Who_ says there aint goin
to be no war





Chapter XVIII

So everywhere over the country that winter of 1916 there were
lighthearted boys skylarkingat college or on the farms and in the
towns the young machinists snowballed one another as they came from the
shops while on this Sunday of the frat snow fight probably several
hundreds of thousands of youthful bachelors between the two oceans
went walking like Ramsey each with a girl who could forget the
weather Yet boys of nineteen and in the twenties were not lighthearted
all the time that winter and that spring and that summer Most of them
knew long thoughtful moments as Ramsey did when they seemed to be
thinking not of girls or work or playnor of anything around them
but of some more vital matter or prospect And at such times they were
grave but not ungentle

For the long strain was on the country underneath all its outward
seeming of things going on as usual there shook a deep vibration like
the air trembling to vast organ pipes in diapasons too profound to reach
the ear as sound one felt not heard thunder in the ground under
ones feet The succession of diplomatic Notes came to an end after the
torpedoing of the _Sussex_ and at last the tricky ruling Germans in
Berlin gave their word to murder no more and people said This means
peace for America and all is well for us but everybody knew in his
heart that nothing was well for us that there was no peace

They said All is well while that thunder in the ground never
ceasedit grew deeper and heavier till all America shook with it and it
became slowly audible as the voice of the old American soil wherein lay
those who had defended it aforetime a soil that bred those who would
defend it again for it was theirs and the meaning of itLife
Liberty and the Pursuit of Happinesswas theirs and theirs to defend
And they knew they would defend it and that more than the glory of a
Nation was at stake The Freedom of Man was at stake So gradually
the sacred thunder reached the ears of the young men and gave them those
deep moments that came to them whether they sat in the classroom or
the countingroom or walked with the plow or stood to the machine or
behind the ribbon counter Thus the thunder shook them and tried them
and slowly came into their lives and changed everything for them

Hate of the Germans was not bred but a contempt for what Germany had
shown in lieu of a national heart a contempt as mighty and profound as
the resolve that the German way and the German will should prevail in
America nor in any country of the world that would be free And when
the German Kaiser laid his command upon America that no American should
take his ship upon the free seas death being the penalty for any who
disobeyed then the German Kaiser got his answer not only to this
new law he had made for us but to many other thoughts of his Yet the
answer was for some time delayed

There was a bitter Sunday and its bitterness went everywhere to
every place in the whole world that held high and generous hearts Its
bitterness came to the special meeting in the Frat hall where there
were hearts indeed of that right sort and one of them became vocal
in its bitterness This was the heart of Fred Mitchell who was now an
authority being president of the Junior Class chairman of the Prom
Committee and other things pleasant to be and to live for at his age

For me Brothers he said Id think Id a great deal rather have
been shot through the head than heard the news from Washington today I
tell you Ive spent the meanest afternoon I ever did in my life and I
guess its been pretty much the same with all of us The worst of it
is it looks as though there isnt a thing in the world we can do The
countrys been betrayed by a few blatherskites and boneheads that had
the power to do it and all we can do weve just got to stand it But
theres some Americans that arent just standing it and I want to tell
you a lot of em are men from the universities just like us Theyre
_over there_ right now they havent said muchthey just packed up and
went Theyre flying for France and for England and for Canada theyre
fighting under every flag on the right side of the Western Front and
theyre driving ambulances at Verdun and ammunition trucks at the Somme
Well theres going to be a lot more American boys on all these jobs
mighty soon on account of what those men did in Congress today If
they wont give us a chance to do something under our own flag then
well have to go and do it under some other flag and I want to tell you
Im one thats going to _go_ Ill stick it out in college up to Easter
and then if theres still no chance to go under the Stars and Stripes
Ill maybe have to go under the flag my greatgreatgrandfather fought
against in 1776 but anyhow Ill _go_

It was in speaking to Ramsey of this declaration that Dora said Fred was
a dangerous firebrand They were taking another February walk but the
February was February 1917 and the day was dry and sunny Its just
about a year ago she said

What is Ramsey asked

That first time we went walking Dont you remember

Oh _that_ day Yes I remember it was snowing

And so cold and blowy she added It seems a long time ago I like
walking with you Ramsey Youre so quiet and solidIve always felt
I could talk to you just anyhow I pleased and you wouldnt mind Ill
miss these walks with you when were out of college

He chuckled Thats funny

Why

Because weve only taken four besides this two last year and another
week before last and another last week This is only the fifth

Good gracious Is that all It seemed to me wed gone ever so often
She laughed Im afraid you wont think that seems much as if Id liked
going but I really have And by the way youve never called on me at
all Perhaps its because Ive forgotten to ask you

Oh no Ramsey said and scuffed his shoes on the path presently
explaining rather huskily that he never _was_ much of a caller and he
added or anything

Well you must come if you ever care to she said with a bigsister
graciousness The Dorm chaperon sits there of course but ours is
a jolly one and youd like her Youve probably met herMrs
Hustingswhen youve called on other girls at our old shop

No said Ramsey I never was much of a He paused fearing that he
might be repeating himself and too hastily amended his intention I
never liked any girl enough to go and call on her

Ramsey Milholland she cried Why when we were in school half the
room used to be talking about how you and that pretty Milla

No no Ramsey protested again too hurriedly I never called on her
We just went walking

A moment later his colour suddenly became fiery I dont meanI
mean he stammered It was walking of courseI mean we did go out
walking but it wasnt walking likelike this He concluded with a fit
of coughing which seemed to rack him

Dora threw back her head and laughed delightfully Dont you
apologize she said _I_ didnt when I said it seemed to me that weve
gone walking so often when in reality its only four or five times
altogether I think I can explain though I think it came partly from
a feeling I have that I can rely on youthat youre a good solid
reliable sort of person I remember from the time we were little
children you always had a sort of worried honest look in school
and you used to make a dent in your foreheadyou meant it for a
frownwhenever I caught your eye You hated me so honestly and you
were so honestly afraid I wouldnt see it

Oh nono

Oh yesyes she laughed then grew serious My feeling about
youthat you were a person to be relied on I meanI think it began
that evening in our freshman year after the _Lusitania_ when I stopped
you on campus and you went with me and I couldnt help crying and you
were so nice and quiet I hardly realized then that it was the first
time wed ever really talked togetherof course _I_ did all the
talkingand yet wed known each other so many years I thought of it
afterward But what gave me such a different view of you Id always
thought you were one of that truculent sort of boys always just
bursting for a fight but you showed me youd really never had a fight
in your life and hated fighting and that you sympathized with my
feeling about war She stopped speaking to draw in her breath with a
sharp sigh Ah dont you remember what Ive told you all along How
it keeps coming closer and closerand now its almost here Isnt it
_unthinkable_ And what can we do to stop it we poor few who feel that
we _must_ stop it

Well Ramsey began uncomfortably Of course II

You cant do much she said I know None of us can What can any
little group do There are so few of us among the undergraduatesand
only one in the whole faculty All the rest are for war But we mustnt
give up we must never feel afterward that we left anything undone we
must fight to the last breath

Fight he repeated wonderingly then chuckled

Oh as a figure of speech she said impatiently Our language
is full of barbaric figures left over from the dark ages But oh
Ramseyshe touched his sleeveIve heard that Fred Mitchell is
saying that hes going to Canada after Easter to try to get into the
Canadian aviation corps If its true hes a dangerous firebrand I
think Is it true

I guess so Hes been talking that way some

But why do you _let_ him talk that way she cried Hes your
roommate surely you have more influence with him than anybody else has
Couldnt you

He shook his head slowly while upon his face the faintly indicated
modellings of a grin hinted of an inner laughter at some surreptitious
thought Well you know Fred says himself sometimes I dont seem to
be much of a talker exactly

I know But dont you see That sort of thing is contagious Others
will think they ought to go if he does hes popular and quite a leader
Cant you do anything with him

She waited for him to answer Cant you she insisted

The grin had disappeared and Ramsey grew red again He seemed to wish
to speak to heave with speech that declined to be spoken and would not
rouse up from his inwards Finally he uttered words

IIwell I

Oh I know she said A manor a boyalways hates to be intruding
his own convictions upon other men especially in a case like this
where he might be afraid of some idiots thinking him unmanlike But
Ramsey Suddenly she broke off and looked at him attentively his
discomfort had become so obvious that suspicion struck her She spoke
sharply Ramsey _you_ arent dreaming of doing such a thing are you

What such a thing

Fred hasnt influenced _you_ has he You arent planning to go with
him are you

Where

To join the Canadian aviation

No I hadnt thought of doing it

She sighed again relieved I had a queer feeling about you just
thenthat you _were_ thinking of doing some such thing You looked so
oddand youre always so quiet anybody might not really know what you
do think But Im not wrong about you am I Ramsey

They had come to the foot of the steps that led up to the entrance of
her dormitory and their walk was at an end As they stopped and
faced each other she looked at him earnestly but he did not meet the
scrutiny his eyelids fell

Im not wrong am I Ramsey

About what he murmured uncomfortably

You are my friend arent you

Yes

Then its all right she said That relieves me and makes me happier
than I was just now for of course if youre my friend you wouldnt let
me make any mistake about you I believe you and now just before I go
in and we wont see much of each other for a weekif you still want me
to go with you again next Sunday

Yeswont you please

Yes if you like But I want to tell you now that I count on you in all
this even though you dont talk much as you say I count on you
more than I do on anybody else and I trust you when you say youre my
friend and it makes me happy And I think perhaps youre right about
Fred Mitchell Talk isnt everything nobody knows that better than
I who talk so much and I think that instead of talking to Fred a
steady quiet influence like yours would do more good than any amount of
arguing So I trust you you see And Im sorry I had that queer doubt
of you She held out her hand Unless I happen to see you on the
campus for a minute in the meantime its goodbye until a week from
today Sowell so goodbye until then

Wait said Ramsey

What is it

He made a great struggle Im not influencing Fred not to go he said
Idont want you to trust me to do anything like that

What

I think its all right for him to go if he wants to Ramsey said
miserably

You do For him to go to _fight_

He swallowed Yes

_Oh_ she cried turned even redder than he and ran up the stone
steps But before the storm doors closed upon her she looked down to
where he stood with his eyes still lowered a lonelyseeming figure
upon the pavement below Her voice caught upon a sob as she spoke

If you feel like that you might as well go and enlist yourself she
said bitterly I cantI couldntspeak to you again after this





Chapter XIX

It was easy enough for him to evade Fred Mitchells rallyings these
days the sprigs mood was truculent not toward his roommate but toward
Congress which was less in fiery haste than he to be definitely at war
with Germany All through the university the change had come athletics
in other years spotlighted at the centre of the stage languished
suddenly threatened with abandonment students working for senior
honours forgot them everything was forgotten except that growing
thunder in the soil Several weeks elapsed after Doras bitter dismissal
of Ramsey before she was mentioned between the comrades Then one
evening Fred asked as he restlessly paced their study floor

Have you seen your pacifist friend lately

No Not exactly Why

Well for my part I think she ought to be locked up Fred said
angrily Have you heard what she did this afternoon

No

Its all over college She got up in the class in jurisprudence and
made a speech Its a big class you know over two hundred under Dean
Burney Hes a great lecturer but hes a pacifistthe only one on the
facultyand a friend of Doras They say he encouraged her to make this
break and led the subject around so she could do it and then called on
her for an opinion as the higheststand student in the class She got up
and claimed there wasnt any such thing as a legitimate cause for war
either legally or morally and said it was a sign of weakness in a
nation for it to believe that it did have cause for war

Well it was too much for that little spunky Joe Stansbury and he
jumped up and argued with her He made her admit all the Germans have
done to us the sea murders and the land murders the blowing up of the
factories the propaganda the strikes trying to turn the United States
into a German settlement trying to get Japan and Mexico to make war on
us and all the rest He even made her admit there was proof they mean
to conquer us when they get through with the others and that theyve
set out to rule the world for their own benefit and make whoever else
they kindly allow to live to work for them

She said it might be true but since nothing at all could be a right
cause for war than all this couldnt be a cause of war Of course she
had her regular pacifist logic working she said that since war is
the worst thing there is why all other evils were lesser and a lesser
evil cant be a just cause for a greater She got terribly excited
they say but kept right on anyway She said war was murder and there
couldnt be any other way to look at it and shed heard there was
already talk in the university of students thinking about enlisting
and whoever did such a thing was virtually enlisting to return murder for
murder Then Joe Stansbury asked her if she meant that shed feel toward
any student that enlisted the way she would toward a murderer and she
said yes shed have a horror of any student that enlisted

Well that broke up the class Joe turned from her to the platform and
told old Burney that he was responsible for allowing such talk in his
lectureroom and Joe said so far as _he_ was concerned he resigned
from Burneys classes right there That started it and practically the
whole class got up and walked out with Joe They said Burney streaked
off home and Dora was left alone in there with her head down on her
deskand I guess she certainly deserves it A good many have already
stopped speaking to her

Ramsey fidgeted with a pen on the table by which he sat Well I dont
know he said slowly I dont know if they ought to do that exactly

Why oughtnt they Fred demanded sharply

Well it looks to me as if she was only fightin for her principles
She believes in em The more it costs a person to stick to their
principles why the more I believe the person must have something
pretty fine about em likely

Yes said the hotheaded Fred That may be in ordinary times but not
when a persons principles are liable to betray their country We wont
stand that kind of principles I tell you and we oughtnt to Dora
Yocums finding that out all right She had the biggest position of
any girl in this place or any boy either up to the last few weeks and
there wasnt any student or hardly even a member of the faculty that had
the influence or was more admired and looked up to She had the whole
show But now since shes just the same as called any student a
murderer if he enlists to fight for his country and his flagwell now
she hasnt got anything at all and if she keeps on shell have even
less

He paused in his walking to and fro and came to a halt behind his
friends chair looking down compassionately upon the back of Ramseys
motionless head His tone changed I guess it isnt just the ticketme
to be talking this way to you is it he said with a trace of
huskiness

Ohits all right Ramsey murmured not altering his position

I cant help blowing up Fred went on I want to say though I know
Im not very considerate to blow up about her to you this way Ive been
playing horse with you about her ever since freshman year butwell
you must have understood Ram I never meant anything that would really
bother you much and I thoughtwell I _really_ thought it was a good
thing youyourwell I mean about her you know Im on all right I
know its pretty serious with you He paused

Ramsey did not move except that his right hand still fidgeted with the
pen upon the table

Ohwell he said

Itsits kind of tough luck his friend contrived to say and he
began to pace the floor again

Ohwell

See here ole stickinthemud Fred broke out abruptly After her
saying what she did Well its none o my business butbut

Well what Ramsey murmured I dont care what you say if you want
to say anything

Well I _got_ to say it Fred half groaned and half blurted After
she said _that_and she meant itwhy if I were in your place Id be
darned if Id be seen out walking with her again

Im not going to be Ramsey said quietly

By George And now Fred halted in front of him both being huskily
solemn I think I understand a little of what that means to you old
Ramsey I think I do I think I know something of what it costs you to
make that resolution for your countrys sake Impulsively he extended
his hand Its a pretty big thing for you to do Will you shake hands

But Ramsey shook his head I didnt do it I wouldnt ever have done
anything just on account of her talkin that way She shut the door on
meit was a good while ago

She did What for

Well Im not much of a talker you know Fred said Ramsey staring
at the pen he played with Im not much of anything for that matter
probly but IwellI

You what

Well I had to tell her I didnt feel about things the way she did
Shed thought I had all along I guess Anyway it made her hate me
or something I guess and she called it all off I expect there wasnt
much to call off so far as she was concerned anyhow He laughed
feebly She told me I better go and enlist

Pleasant of her Fred muttered Especially as we know what she thinks
enlisting means He raised his voice cheerfully Well thats settled
and thank God old Mr Bernstorffs on his way to his sweet little
vineclad cottage home Theyre getting guns on the ships and the big
shows liable to commence any day We can hold up our heads now and
were going to see some great times old Ramsey boy Its hard on the
home folksGosh I dont like to think of that And I guess its going
to be hard on a lot of boys that havent understood what its all about
and hard on some that their family affairs and business and so on
have got em tied up so its hard to goand of course theres plenty
that just cant and some that arent husky enoughbut the rest of
us are going to have the big time in our lives We got an awful lot to
learn it scares me to think of what I dont know about being any
sort of a rearrank private Why its a regular _profession_ like
practising law or selling for a drug house on the road Golly Do you
remember how we talked about that way back in freshman year what
we were going to do when we got out of college You were going to
be practising law for instance and Iwell fr instance remember
Colburn he was going to be a doctor and he did go to some medical
school for one year Now hes in the Red Cross somewhere in _Persia_
Golly

He paused to digest this impossibility then chattered briskly on
Well theres _one_ good old boy was with our class for a while back
in freshman year I bet we wont see him in any good old army Old
roughneck Linski that you put the knob on his nose for Tommie Hopper
says he saw him last summer in Chicago soapboxin yellin his head off
cussin every government under the sun but mostly ours and the Allies
you bet and going to run the earth by revolution and representatives
of unskilled labour immigrants nobody that can read or write allowed
to vote except Linski Tommie Hopper says he knows all about Linski
he never did a days work in his lifetoo busy trying to get the
workingmen stirred up against the people that exploit em Tommie says
he had a big crowd to hear him though and took up quite a little money
for a cause or something Well let him holler I guess we can attend
to him when we get back from over yonder By George old Ram Im
gettin kind of floppy in the gills He administered a resounding slap
to his comrades shoulder It certainly looks as if our big days were
walking toward us


He was right The portentous days came on apace and each one brought a
new and greater portent The faces of men lost a driven look besetting
them in the days of badgered waiting and instead of that heavy
apprehension one saw the look mens faces must have worn in 1776 and
1861 and the history of the old days grew clearer in the new The
President went to the Congress and the true indictment he made there
reached scoffing Potsdam with an unspoken prophecy somewhat chilling even
to Potsdam one guessesand then through an April night went almost
quietly the steady work we were at war with Germany

The bugles sounded across the continent drums and fifes played up and
down the city streets and in town and village squares and through the
countrysides Faintly in all ears there was multitudinous noise like
distant hoarse cheering and a sound like that was what Dora Yocum
heard one night as she sat lonely in her room The bugles and fifes
and drums had been heard about the streets of the college town that
day and she thought she must die of them they hurt her so and now to
be haunted by this imaginary cheering

She started Was it imaginary

She went downstairs and stood upon the steps of the dormitory in the
open air No the cheering was real and loud It came from the direction
of the railway station and the night air surged and beat with it

Below her stood the aged janitor of the building listening Whats the
cheering for she asked remembering grimly that the janitor was one of
her acquaintances who had not yet stopped speaking to her Whats the
matter

Its a good matter the old man answered I guess there must be a
big crowd of em down there One of our students enlisted today and
theyre givin him a sendoff Listen to em how they _do_ cheer Hes
the first one to go

She went back to her room shivering and spent the next day in bed with
an aching head She rose in the evening howevera handbill had been
slid under her door at five oclock calling a Mass Meeting of the
university at eight and she felt it her duty to go but when she got to
the great hall she found a seat in the dimmest corner farthest from the
rostrum

The president of the university addressed the tumultuous many hundreds
before him for tumultuous they were until he quieted them He talked to
them soberly of patriotism and called upon them for deliberation and
a little patience There was danger of a stampede he said and he and
the rest of the faculty were in a measure responsible to their fathers
and mothers for them

You must keep your heads he said God knows I do not seek to judge
your duty in this gravest moment of your lives nor assume to tell you
what you must or must not do But by hurrying into service now without
careful thought or consideration you may impair the extent of your
possible usefulness to the very cause you are so anxious to serve
Hundreds of you are taking technical courses which should be
completedat least to the end of the term in June Instructors from the
United States Army are already on the way here and military training
will be begun at once for all who are physically eligible and of
acceptable age A special course will be given in preparation for
flying and those who wish to become aviators may enroll themselves for
the course at once

I speak to you in a crisis of the universitys life as well as that of
the nation and the warning I utter has been made necessary by what took
place yesterday and today Yesterday morning a student in the junior
class enlisted as a private in the United States Regular Army Far be it
from me to deplore his course in so doing he spoke to me about it and
in such a way that I felt I had no right to dissuade him I told him
that it would be preferable for college men to wait until they could
go as officers and aside from the fact of a greater prestige I urged
that men of education could perhaps be more useful in that capacity He
replied that if he were useful enough as a private a commission might in
time come his way and as I say I did not feel at liberty to attempt
dissuasion He left to join a regiment to which he had been assigned
and many of you were at the station to bid him farewell

But enthusiasm may be too contagious even a great and inspiring motive
may work for harm and the university must not become a desert In the
twentyfour hours since that young man went to join the army last night
one hundred and eleven of our young men students have left our walls
eightyfour of them went off together at three oclock to catch an
eastbound train at the junction and enlist for the Navy at Newport We
are I say in danger of a stampede

He spoke on but Dora was not listening she had become obsessed by the
idea which seemed to be carrying her to the border of tragedy When the
crowd poured forth from the building she went with it mechanically and
paused in the dark outside She spoke to a girl whom she did not know

I beg your pardon

Yes

I wanted to ask Do you know who was the student Doctor Corvis spoke
of I mean the one that was the first to enlist and that they were
cheering last night when he went away to be a private in the United
States Army Did you happen to hear his name

Yes he was a junior

Who was it

Ramsey Milholland





Chapter XX

Fred Mitchell crossing the campus one morning ten days later saw Dora
standing near the entrance of her dormitory where he would pass her
unless he altered his course and as he drew nearer her and the details
of her face grew into distinctness he was indignant with himself
for feeling less and less indignation toward her in proportion to the
closeness of his approach The pity that came over him was mingled with
an unruly admiration causing him to wonder what unpatriotic stuff
he could be made of She was marked but not whipped she still held
herself straight under all the hammering and cutting which to his
knowledge she had been getting

She stopped him for only a moment she said adding with a wan
profoundness That is if youre not one of those who feel that I
shouldnt be spoken to

No said Fred stiffly I may share their point of view perhaps but
I dont feel called upon to obtrude it on you in that manner

I see she said nodding Ive wanted to speak with you about
Ramsey

All right

She bit her lip then asked abruptly What made him do it

Enlist as a private with the regulars

No What made him enlist at all

Only because hes that sort Fred returned briskly He may be
inexplicable to people who believe that his going out to fight for his
country is the same thing as going out to commit a mur

She lifted her hand Couldnt you

I beg your pardon Fred said at once Im sorry but I dont know
just how to explain him to you

Why

He laughed apologetically Well you see as I understand it you
dont think its possible for a person to have something within him that
makes him care so much about his country that he

Wait she cried Dont you think Im willing to suffer a little
rather than to see my country in the wrong Dont you think Im doing
it

Well I dont want to be rude but of course it seems to me that
youre suffering because you think you know more about whats right and
wrong than anybody else does

Oh no But I

We wouldnt get anywhere probably by arguing it Fred said You
asked me

I asked you to tell my why he enlisted

The trouble is I dont think I _can_ tell that to anybody who needs
an answer He just went of course There isnt any question about it I
always thought hed be the first to go

Oh no she said

Yes I always thought so

I think you were mistaken she said decidedly It was a special
reasonto make him act so cruelly

Cruelly Fred cried

It _was_

Cruel to whom

Oh to his motherto his family To have him go off that way without
a word

Oh no hed been home Fred corrected her He went home the Saturday
before he enlisted and settled it with them Theyre all broken up of
course but when they saw hed made up his mind they quit opposing him
and I think theyre proud of him about it maybe in spite of feeling
anxious You see his father was an artilleryman in the war with
Spain and his grandfather was a Colonel at the end of the War of the
Rebellion though he went into it as a private like Ramsey He died
when Ramsey was about twelve but Ramsey remembers him he was talking
of him a little the night before he enlisted

Dora made a gesture of despairing protest You dont understand

What is it I dont understand

Ramsey _I_ know why he wentand its just killing me

Fred looked at her gravely I dont think you need worry about it he
said Theres nothing about his going that you are responsible for

She repeated her despairing gesture You dont understand But its no
use It doesnt help any to try to talk of it though I thought maybe
it would somehow She went a little nearer the dormitory entrance
leaving him where he was then turned I suppose you wont see him

I dont know Most probably not till we meetif we shouldin France
I dont know where hes stationed and Im going with the aviationif
its ever ready And hes with the regulars hell probably be among the
first to go over

I see She turned sharply away calling back over her shoulder in a
choked voice Thank you Goodbye

But Freds heart had melted gazing after her he saw that her
proud young head had lowered now and that her shoulders were moving
convulsively he ran after her and caught her as she began slowly to
ascend the dormitory steps

See here he cried Dont

She lifted a wet face No no He went in bitterness because I told him
to in my own bitterness Ive killed him Long ago when he wasnt much
more than a child I heard hed said that some day hed show me and
now hes done it

Fred whistled low and long when she had disappeared Girls he
murmured to himself Some girls anyhowthey will be girls You cant
tell em whats what and you cant change em either

Then as more urgent matters again occupied his attention he went on at
an ardent and lively gait to attend his class in mapmaking





Chapter XXI

That thunder in the soil at first too deep within it to be audible had
come to the surface now and gradually became heard as the thunder of
a million feet upon the training grounds The bugles rang sharper the
drums and fifes of town and village and countryside were the drums and
fifes of a war that came closer and closer to every hearth between the
two oceans

All the old symbols became symbols bright and new as if no one had ever
seen them before America was like a new word and the song America
was like a new song All the dusty blatancies of orating candidates
seeking to rouse bored auditors with the old flag all the mechanical
patriotics of school and church and club all these timeworn flaccid
things leaped suddenly into living colour The flag became brilliant and
strange to seestrange with a meaning that seemed new a meaning long
known yet never known till now

And so hearts that thought they knew themselves came upon ambushes of
emotion and hidden indwellings of spirit not guessed before Dora Yocum
listening to the Star Spangled Banner sung by children of immigrants
to an outoftune old piano in a mission clubroom in Chicago found
herself crying with a soulshaking heartiness in a way different from
other ways that she had cried Among the many things she thought of then
was this That the banner the children were singing about was in danger
The great country almost a continent had always seemed so untouchable
so safe and sure she had never been able to conceive of a hostile
power mighty enough to shake or even jar it And since so great and
fundamental a thing could not be injured a war for its defence had
appeared to be in her eyes not only wicked but ridiculous At last
less and less vaguely she had come to comprehend something of the
colossal German threat and the shadow that touched this bright banner
of which the immigrants children piped so briskly in the mission
clubroom

She had begun to understand though she could not have told just why
or how or at what moment understanding reached her She began to
understand that her country threatened to the life had flung its line
those thousands of miles across the sea to stand and hold Hindenburg and
Ludendorff and all their Kaisers Kings Dukes and Crown Princes their
Krupp and Skoda monstrous engines and their monstrous other engines of
men made into armies Through the long haze of misted seamiles and the
smoke of landmiles she perceived that brown line of ours and knew it
stood there that Freedom and the Nation itself might not perish from
the earth

And so a week later she went home and came nervously to Ramseys
mother and found how to direct the letter she wanted to write He was in
France

As the old phrase went she poured out her heart It seems to apply to
her letter

She wrote

Dont misunderstand me I felt that my bitter speech to you had driven
you to take the step you did I felt that I had sent you to be killed
and that I ought to be killed for doing it but I knew that you had
other motives too I knew of course that you thought of the country
more than you did of me or of any mad thing I would saybut I thought
that what I said might have been the prompting thing the word that
threw you into it so hastily and before you were ready perhaps I
dreaded to bear that terrible responsibility I hope you understand

My great mistake has beenI thought I sas so logicalits been in
my starting everything with a thought Id never proven that war is the
worst thing and all other evils were lesser I was wrong I was wrong
because war isnt the worst evil Slavery is the worse evil and now
I want to tell you I have come to see that you are making war on those
that make slavery Yes you are fighting those that make both war and
slavery and you are right and I humbly reverence and honour all of
you who are in this right war I have come home to work in the Red Cross
here I work there all day and all day I keep saying to myselfbut I
really mean to _you_its what I pray and oh how I pray it God be
with you and grant you the victory For you must win and you will win

Forgive me oh pleaseand if you will could you write to me I know
you have things to do more important than girlsbut oh couldnt you
please

This letter which she had taken care not to dampen as she wrote went
in slow course to the American Expeditionary Forces in France and
finally found him whom it patiently sought He delayed not long to
answer and in time she held in a shaking hand the pencilled missive he
had sent her

You forget all that comic talk about me enlisting because of your
telling me to Id written my father I was going at the first chance a
month and a half before that day when you said it My mind was made up
at the first time there was any talk of war and you had about as much
responsibility for my going as some little sparrow or something Of
course I dont mean I didnt pay any attention to the different things
you said because I always did and I used to worry over it because I
was afraid some day it would get you in trouble and Im mighty glad
youve cut it out Thats right you be a regular girl now You always
were one and I knew it all right Im not as scared to write to you as
I was to talk to you so I guess you know I was mighty tickled to get
your letter It sounded blue but I was glad to get it You _bet_ Ill
write to you I dont suppose you could have any idea how glad I was to
get your letter I could sit here and write to you all day if theyd let
me but Im a corporal now When you answer this I wish youd say how
the old town looks and if the grass in the front yards is as green as it
usually is and everything And tell me some more about everything you
think of when you are working down at the Red Cross like you said
I guess Ive read your letter five million times and that part ten
million I mean where you underlined that _you_ and what you said
to yourself at the Red Cross Oh murder but I was glad to read that
Dont forget about writing anything else you think of like that

Well I was interrupted then and this is the next day Of course I
cant tell you where we are because that darned censor will read this
letter but I guess he will let this much by Who do you think I ran
across in a village yesterday Two boys from the old school days and
we certainly did shake hands a few times It was the old foolish Dutch
Krusemeyer and Albert Paxton both of them lieutenants I heard Fred
Mitchell is still training in the States and about crazy because they
wont send him over yet

If you had any idea how glad I was to get your letter you wouldnt lose
any time answering this one Anyhow Im going to write to you again
every few days if I get the chance because maybe youll answer more
than one of em

But see here cut out that sent you to be killed stuff Youve got the
wrong idea altogether Weve got the big job of our lives we know that
but were going to do it Therell be mistakes and bad times but we
wont fall down Now youll excuse me for saying it this way Dora but
I dont know just how to express myself except saying of course we know
everybody isnt going to get back homebut listen we didnt come
over here to get killed particularly we came over here to give these
Dutchmen hl

Perhaps you can excuse language if I write it with a blank like that
but before we get back were going to do what we came for They may not
all of them be as bad as some of themits a good thing you dont know
what we do because some of it would make you sick As I say there may
be quite a lot of good ones among them but we know what theyve done to
this country and we know what they mean to do to ours So were going
to attend to them Of course thats why Im here It wasnt you

Dont forget to write pretty soon Dora You say in your letterI
certainly was glad to get that letterwell you say I have things to do
more important than girls Dora I think you probably know without my
saying so that of course while I have got important things to do just
as every man over here has and everybody at home for that matter
well the thing that is most important in the world to me next to
helping win this war its reading the next letter from you

Dont forget how glad Ill be to get it and dont forget you didnt
have anything to do with my being over here That wasit was something
else And you bet whatever happens Im glad I came Dont ever forget
_that_

Dora knew it was something else Her memory went back to her first
recollection of him in school from that time on he had been just an
ordinary everyday boy floundering somehow through his lessons in
school and through his sweethearting with Milla as the millions of
other boys floundered along with their own lessons and their own
Millas She saw him swinging his books and romping homeward from the
schoolhouse or going whistling by her fathers front yard rattling
a stick on the fence as he went carefree and masterful but shy as a
deer if strangers looked at him and always not much of a talker

She had always felt so superior to him she shuddered as she thought of
it His quiet had been so much better than her talk His intelligence
was proven now when it came to the great test to be of a stronger sort
than hers He was wise and good and gentleand a fighting man We know
what theyve done to this country and what they mean to do to ours So
were going to attend to them She read this over and she knew that
Ramsey wise and gentle and good would fight like an unchained devil
and that he and his comrades would indeed and indeed do what they came
for

It wasnt you he said She nodded gently agreeing and knew what it
was that sent him Yet Ramsey had his own secret there and did not tell
it Sometimes there rose faint in his memory a whimsical picture yet
one that had always meant much to him He would see an old man sitting
with a little boy upon a rustic bench under a walnut tree to watch the
Decoration Day Parade go byand Ramsey would see a shoot of sunshine
that had somehow got through the walnut tree and made a bedazzlement of
glinting fine lines over a spot about the size of a saucer upon the old
mans thick white hair And in Ramseys memory the little boy sitting
beside the veteran would half close his eyes drowsily playing that
this sunshine spot was a white birdsnest until he had a momentary
dream of a glittering little bird that dwelt there and wore a blue
soldier cap on its head And Ramsey would bring out of his memory
thoughts that the old man had got into the childs head that day We
knew that armies fighting for the Freedom of Man _had_ to win in the
long run We were on the side of Gods Plan Long ago we began to
see hints of His Plan Man has to win his freedom from himselfmen
in the light have to fight against men in the dark That light is the
answer We had the light that made us never doubt


A long while Dora sat with the letter in her hand before she answered it
and took it upon her heart to wear That was the place for it since it
was already within her heart where he would find it when he came home
again And she beheld the revelation sent to her This ordinary life of
Ramseys was but the outward glinting of a high and splendid spirit as
high and splendid as earth can show And yet it was only the life of an
everyday American boy The streets of the town were full now of boys
like Ramsey

At first they were just boys in uniform then one saw that they were
boys no more

They were soldiers
