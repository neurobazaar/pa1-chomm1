THE LANDLORD AT LIONS HEAD

By William Dean Howells




Part I


BIBLIOGRAPHICAL

In those dim recesses of the consciousness where things have their
beginning if ever things have a beginning I suppose the origin of this
novel may be traced to a fact of a fortnights sojourn on the western
shore of lake Champlain in the summer of 1891 Across the water in the
State of Vermont I had constantly before my eyes a majestic mountain form
which the earlier French pioneers had named Le Lion Couchant but which
their plainerminded Yankee successors preferred to call The Camels
Hump It really looked like a sleeping lion the head was especially
definite and when in the course of some ten years I found the scheme
for a story about a summer hotel which I had long meant to write this
image suggested the name of The Landlord at Lions Head I gave the
title to my unwritten novel at once and never wished to change it but
rejoiced in the certainty that whatever the novel turned out to be the
title could not be better

I began to write the story four years later when we were settled for the
winter in our flat on Central Park and as I was a year in doing it with
other things I must have taken the unfinished manuscript to and from
Magnolia Massachusetts and Long Beach Long Island where I spent the
following summer It was first serialized in Harpers Weekly and in the
London Illustrated News as well as in an Australian newspaperI forget
which one and it was published as a completed book in 1896

I remember concerning it a very becoming despair when at a certain
moment in it I began to wonder what I was driving at I have always had
such moments in my work and if I cannot fitly boast of them I can at
least own to them in freedom from the pride that goes before a fall My
only resource at such times was to keep working keep beating harder and
harder at the wall which seemed to close me in till at last I broke
through into the daylight beyond In this case I had really such a very
good grip of my characters that I need not have had the usual fear of
their failure to work out their destiny But even when the thing was done
and I carried the completed manuscript to my dear old friend the late
Henry Loomis Nelson then editor of the Weekly it was in more fear of
his judgment than I cared to show As often happened with my manuscript
in such exigencies it seemed to go all to a handful of shrivelled
leaves When we met again and he accepted it for the Weekly with a
handclasp of hearty welcome I could scarcely gasp out my unfeigned
relief We had talked the scheme of it over together he had liked the
notion and he easily made me believe after my first dismay that he
liked the result even better

I myself liked the hero of the tale more than I have liked worthier men
perhaps because I thought I had achieved in him a true rustic New England
type in contact with urban life under entirely modern conditions What
seemed to me my esthetic success in him possibly softened me to his
ethical shortcomings but I do not expect others to share my weakness for
Jeff Durgin whose strong rough surname had been waiting for his
personality ever since I had got it off the side of an icecart many
years before

At the time the story was imagined Harvard had been for four years much
in the direct knowledge of the author and I pleased myself in realizing
the heros experience there from even more intimacy with the university
moods and manners than had supported me in the studies of an earlier
fiction dealing with them I had not lived twelve years in Cambridge
without acquaintance such as even an elder man must make with the
undergraduate life but it is only from its own level that this can be
truly learned and I have always been ready to stand corrected by
undergraduate experience Still I have my belief that as a jaythe word
may now be obsoleteJeff Durgin is not altogether out of drawing though
this is of course the phase of his character which is one of the least
important What I most prize in him if I may go to the bottom of the
inkhorn is the realization of that antiPuritan quality which was always
vexing the heart of Puritanism and which I had constantly felt one of
the most interesting facts in my observation of New England

As for the sort of summer hotel portrayed in these pages it was
materialized from an acquaintance with summer hotels extending over
quarter of a century and scarcely to be surpassed if paralleled I had a
passion for knowing about them and understanding their operation which I
indulged at every opportunity and which I remember was satisfied as to
every reasonable detail at one of the pleasantest seaside hostelries by
one of the most intelligent and obliging of landlords Yet hotels for
hotels I was interested in those of the hills rather than those of the
shores

I worked steadily if not rapidly at the story Often I went back over it
and tore it to pieces and put it together again It made me feel at times
as if I should never learn my trade but so did every novel I have
written every novel in fact has been a new trade In the case of this
one the publishers were hurrying me in the revision for copy to give the
illustrator who was hurrying his pictures for the English and Australian
serializations

THE LANDLORD AT LIONS HEAD


I

If you looked at the mountain from the west the line of the summit was
wandering and uncertain like that of most mountaintops but seen from
the east the mass of granite showing above the dense forests of the
lower slopes had the form of a sleeping lion The flanks and haunches
were vaguely distinguished from the mass but the mighty head resting
with its tossed mane upon the vast paws stretched before it was boldly
sculptured against the sky The likeness could not have been more
perfect when you had it in profile if it had been a definite intention
of art and you could travel far north and far south before the illusion
vanished In winter the head was blotted by the snows and sometimes the
vagrant clouds caught upon it and deformed it or hid it at other
seasons but commonly after the last snow went in the spring until the
first snow came in the fall the Lions Head was a part of the landscape
as imperative and importunate as the Great Stone Face itself

Long after other parts of the hill country were opened to summer sojourn
the region of Lions Head remained almost primitively solitary and
savage A stony mountain road followed the bed of the torrent that
brawled through the valley at its base and at a certain point a still
rougher lane climbed from the road along the side of the opposite height
to a lonely farmhouse pushed back on a narrow shelf of land with a
meagre acreage of field and pasture broken out of the woods that clothed
all the neighboring steeps The farmhouse level commanded the best view
of Lions Head and the visitors always mounted to it whether they came
on foot or arrived on buckboards or in buggies or drove up in the
Concord stages from the farther and nearer hotels The drivers of the
coaches rested their horses there and watered them from the spring that
dripped into the green log at the barn the passengers scattered about
the dooryard to look at the Lions Head to wonder at it and mock at it
according to their several makes and moods They could scarcely have felt
that they ever had a welcome from the stalwart handsome woman who sold
them milk if they wanted it and small cakes of maple sugar if they were
very strenuous for something else The ladies were not able to make much
of her from the first but some of them asked her if it were not rather
lonely there and she said that when you heard the catamounts scream at
night and the bears growl in the spring it did seem lonesome When one
of them declared that if she should hear a catamount scream or a bear
growl she should die the woman answered Well she presumed we must all
die some time But the ladies were not sure of a covert slant in her
words for they were spoken with the same look she wore when she told
them that the milk was five cents a glass and the black maple sugar
three cents a cake She did not change when she owned upon their urgence
that the gaunt man whom they glimpsed around the corners of the house was
her husband and the three lank boys with him were her sons that the
children whose faces watched them through the writhing window panes were
her two little girls that the urchin who stood shyly twisted all but
his white head and sunburned face into her dress and glanced at them
with a mocking blue eye was her youngest and that he was three years
old With like coldness of voice and face she assented to their
conjecture that the space walled off in the farther corner of the orchard
was the family burial ground and she said with no more feeling that the
ladies could see than she had shown concerning the other facts that the
graves they saw were those of her husbands family and of the children
she had lost there had been ten children and she had lost four She did
not visibly shrink from the pursuit of the sympathy which expressed
itself in curiosity as to the sickness they had died of the ladies left
her with the belief that they had met a character and she remained with
the conviction briefly imparted to her husband that they were tonguey

The summer folks came more and more every year with little variance in
the impression on either side When they told her that her maple sugar
would sell better if the cake had an image of Lions Head stamped on it
she answered that she got enough of Lions Head without wanting to see it
on all the sugar she made But the next year the cakes bore a rude effigy
of Lions Head and she said that one of her boys had cut the stamp out
with his knife she now charged five cents a cake for the sugar but her
manner remained the same It did not change when the excursionists drove
away and the deep silence native to the place fell after their chatter
When a cock crew or a cow lowed or a horse neighed or one of the boys
shouted to the cattle an echo retorted from the granite base of Lions
Head and then she had all the noise she wanted or at any rate all the
noise there was most of the time Now and then a wagon passed on the
stony road by the brook in the valley and sent up its clatter to the
farmhouse on its high shelf but there was scarcely another break from
the silence except when the coachingparties came

The continuous clash and rush of the brook was like a part of the
silence as the red of the farmhouse and the barn was like a part of the
green of the fields and woods all round them the blackgreen of pines
and spruces the yellowgreen of maples and birches dense to the tops of
the dreary hills and breaking like a bated sea around the Lions Head
The farmer stooped at his work with a thin inwardcurving chest but
his wife stood straight at hers and she had a massive beauty of figure
and a heavily moulded regularity of feature that impressed such as had
eyes to see her grandeur among the summer folks She was forty when they
began to come and an ashen gray was creeping over the reddish heaps of
her hair like the pallor that overlies the crimson of the autumnal oak
She showed her age earlier than most fair people but since her marriage
at eighteen she had lived long in the deaths of the children she had
lost They were born with the taint of their fathers family and they
withered from their cradles The youngest boy alone of all her brood
seemed to have inherited her health and strength The rest as they grew
up began to cough as she had heard her husbands brothers and sisters
cough and then she waited in hapless patience the fulfilment of their
doom The two little girls whose faces the ladies of the first
coachingparty saw at the farmhouse windows had died away from them two
of the lank boys had escaped and in the perpetual exile of California
and Colorado had saved themselves alive Their father talked of going
too but ten years later he still dragged himself spectrally about the
labors of the farm with the same cough at sixty which made his oldest
son at twentynine look scarcely younger than himself




II

One soft noon in the middle of August the farmer came in from the
cornfield that an early frost had blighted and told his wife that they
must give it up He said in his weak hoarse voice with the catarrhal
catching in it that it was no use trying to make a living on the farm
any longer The oats had hardly been worth cutting and now the corn was
gone and there was not hay enough without it to winter the stock if
they got through themselves they would have to live on potatoes Have a
vendue and sell out everything before the snow flew and let the State
take the farm and get what it could for it and turn over the balance
that was left after the taxes the interest of the savingsbank mortgage
would soon eat that up

The long loose cough took him and another cough answered it like an
echo from the barn where his son was giving the horses their feed The
mild waneyed young man came round the corner presently toward the porch
where his father and mother were sitting and at the same moment a boy
came up the lane to the other corner there were sixteen years between
the ages of the brothers who alone were left of the children born into
and borne out of the house The young man waited till they were within
whispering distance of each other and then he gasped Where you been

The boy answered promptly None your business and went up the steps
before the young man with a lopeared livercolored mongrel at his
heels He pulled off his ragged straw hat and flung it on the floor of
the porch Dinner over he demanded

His father made no answer his mother looked at the boys hands and face
all of much the same earthen cast up to the eaves of his thatch of
yellow hair and said You go and wash yourself At a certain light in
his mothers eye which he caught as he passed into the house with his
dog the boy turned and cut a defiant caper The oldest son sat down on
the bench beside his father and they all looked in silence at the
mountain before them They heard the boy whistling behind the house with
sputtering and blubbering noises as if he were washing his face while he
whistled and then they heard him singing with a muffled sound and
sharp breaks from the muffled sound as if he were singing into the
towel he shouted to his dog and threatened him and the scuffling of his
feet came to them through all as if he were dancing

Been after them woodchucks agin his father huskily suggested

I guess so said the mother The brother did not speak he coughed
vaguely and let his head sink forward

The father began a statement of his affairs

The mother said You dont want to go into that we been all over it
before If its come to the pinch now its come But you want to be
sure

The man did not answer directly If we could sell off now and get out to
where Jim is in Californy and get a piece of land He stopped as if
confronted with some difficulty which he had met before but had hoped he
might not find in his way this time

His wife laughed grimly I guess if the truth was known were too poor
to get away

Were poor he whispered back He added with a weak obstinacy I
dknow as were as poor as that comes to The things would fetch
something

Enough to get us out there and then we should be on Jims hands said
the woman

We should till spring maybe I dknow as I want to face another winter
here and I dknow as Jackson does

The young man gasped back courageously I guess I can get along here
well enough

Its made Jim ten years younger Thats what he said urged the father

The mother smiled as grimly as she had laughed I dont believe it ll
make you ten years richer and thats what you want

I dont believe but what we should ha done something with the place by
spring Or the State would the father said lifelessly

The voice of the boy broke in upon them from behind Say mother ant
you never goin to have dinner He was standing in the doorway with a
startling cleanness of the hands and face and a strange wet sleekness
of the hair His clothes were bedrabbled down the front with soap and
water

His mother rose and went toward him his father and brother rose like
apparitions and slanted after her at one angle

Say the boy called again to his mother there comes a peddler He
pointed down the road at the figure of a man briskly ascending the lane
toward the house with a pack on his back and some strange appendages
dangling from it

The woman did not look round neither of the men looked round they all
kept on indoors and she said to the boy as she passed him I got no
time to waste on peddlers You tell him we dont want anything

The boy waited for the figure on the lane to approach It was the figure
of a young man who slung his burden lightly from his shoulders when he
arrived and then stood looking at the boy with his foot planted on the
lowermost tread of the steps climbing from the ground to the porch




III

The boy must have permitted these advances that he might inflict the
greater disappointment when he spoke We dont want anything he said
insolently

Dont you the stranger returned I do I want dinner Go in and tell
your mother and then show me where I can wash my hands

The bold ease of the stranger seemed to daunt the boy and he stood
irresolute His dog came round the corner of the house at the first word
of the parley and while his master was making up his mind what to do
he smelled at the strangers legs Well you cant have any dinner
said the boy tentatively The dog raised the bristles on his neck and
showed his teeth with a snarl The stranger promptly kicked him in the
jaw and the dog ran off howling Come here sir the boy called to
him but the dog vanished round the house with a fading yelp

Now young man said the stranger will you go and do as youre bid
Im ready to pay for my dinner and you can say so The boy stared at
him slowly taking in the facts of his costume with eyes that climbed
from the heavy shoes up the legs of his thickribbed stockings and his
knickerbockers past the pleats and belt of his Norfolk jacket to the
red neckcloth tied under the loose collar of his flannel outingshirt
and so by his face with its soft young beard and its quiet eyes to the
top of his braidless bandless slouch hat of soft felt It was one of the
earliest costumes of the kind that had shown itself in the hill country
and it was altogether new to the boy Come said the wearer of it
dont stand on the order of your going but go at once and he sat down
on the steps with his back to the boy who heard these strange terms of
command with a face of vague envy

The noonday sunshine lay in a thin silvery glister on the slopes of the
mountain before them and in the brilliant light the colossal forms of
the Lions Head were prismatically outlined against the speckless sky
Through the silvery veil there burned here and there on the densely
wooded acclivities the crimson torch of a maple kindled before its time
but everywhere else there was the unbroken green of the forest subdued
to one tone of gray The boy heard the stranger fetch his breath deeply
and then expel it in a long sigh before he could bring himself to obey
an order that seemed to leave him without the choice of disobedience He
came back and found the stranger as he had left him Come on if you
want your dinner he said and the stranger rose and looked at him

Whats your name he asked

Thomas Jefferson Durgin

Well Thomas Jefferson Durgin will you show me the way to the pump and
bring a towel along

Want to wash

I havent changed my mind

Come along then The boy made a movement as if to lead the way
indoors the stranger arrested him

Here Take hold of this and put it out of the rush of travel somewhere
He lifted his burden from where he had dropped it in the road and swung
it toward the boy who ran down the steps and embraced it As he carried
it toward a corner of the porch he felt of the various shapes and
materials in it

Then he said Come on again and went before the guest through the dim
hall running midway of the house to the door at the rear He left him on
a narrow space of stone flagging there and ran with a tin basin to the
spring at the barn and brought it back to him full of the cold water

Towel he said pulling at the family roller inside the little porch at
the door and he watched the stranger wash his hands and face and then
search for a fresh place on the towel

Before the stranger had finished the father and the elder brother came
out and after an ineffectual attempt to salute him slanted away to the
barn together The woman indoors was more successful when he found
her in the diningroom where the boy showed him The table was set for
him alone and it affected him as if the family had been hurried away
from it that he might have it to himself Everything was very simple the
iron forks had two prongs the knives bone handles the dull glass was
pressed the heavy plates and cups were white but so was the cloth and
all were clean The woman brought in a good boiled dinner of cornedbeef
potatoes turnips and carrots from the kitchen and a teapot and said
something about having kept them hot on the stove for him she brought
him a plate of biscuit fresh from the oven then she said to the boy
You come out and have your dinner with me Jeff and left the guest to
make his meal unmolested

The room was square with two north windows that looked down the lane he
had climbed to the house An open door led into the kitchen in an ell
and a closed door opposite probably gave access to a parlor or a
groundfloor chamber The windows were darkened down to the lower sash by
green paper shades the walls were papered in a pattern of brown roses
over the chimney hung a large picture a lifesize pencildrawing of two
little girls one slightly older and slightly larger than the other each
with round eyes and precise ringlets and with her hand clasped in the
others hand

The guest seemed helpless to take his gaze from it and he sat fallen
back in his chair at it when the woman came in with a pie

Thank you I believe I dont want any dessert he said The fact is
the dinner was so good that I havent left any room for pie Are those
your children

Yes said the woman looking up at the picture with the pie in her
hand Theyre the last two I lost

Oh excuse me the guest began

Its the way they appear in the spirit life Its a spirit picture

Oh I thought there was something strange about it

Well its a good deal like the photograph we had taken about a year
before they died Its a good likeness They say they dont change a
great deal at first

She seemed to refer the point to him for his judgment but he answered
wide of it

I came up here to paint your mountain if you dont mind Mrs
DurginLions Head I mean

Oh yes Well I dont know as we could stop you if you wanted to take it
away A spare glimmer lighted up her face

The painter rejoined in kind The town might have something to say I
suppose

Not if you was to leave a good piece of intervale in place of it Weve
got mountains to spare

Well then thats arranged What about a weeks board

I guess you can stay if youre satisfied

Ill be satisfied if I can stay How much do you want

The woman looked down probably with an inward anxiety between the fear
of asking too much and the folly of asking too little She said
tentatively Some of the folks that come over from the hotels say they
pay as much as twenty dollars a week

But you dont expect hotel prices

I dont know as I do Weve never had anybody before

The stranger relaxed the frown he had put on at the greed of her
suggestion it might have come from ignorance or mere innocence Im in
the habit of paying five dollars for farm board where I stay several
weeks What do you say to seven for a single week

I guess that ll do said the woman and she went out with the pie
which she had kept in her hand




IV

The painter went round to the front of the house and walked up and down
before it for different points of view He ran down the lane some way
and then came back and climbed to the sloping field behind the barn
where he could look at Lions Head over the roof of the house He tried
an open space in the orchard where he backed against the wall enclosing
the little burialground He looked round at it without seeming to see
it and then went back to the level where the house stood This is the
place he said to himself But the boy who had been lurking after him
with the dog lurking at his own heels in turn took the words as a
proffer of conversation

I thought youd come to it he sneered

Did you asked the painter with a smile for the unsatisfied grudge in
the boys tone Why didnt you tell me sooner

The boy looked down and apparently made up his mind to wait until
something sufficiently severe should come to him for a retort Want I
should help you get your things he asked presently

Why yes said the painter with a glance of surprise I shall be much
obliged for a lift He started toward the porch where his burden lay
and the boy ran before him They jointly separated the knapsack from the
things tied to it and the painter let the boy carry the easel and
campstool which developed themselves from their folds and hinges and
brought the colors and canvas himself to the spot he had chosen The boy
looked at the tag on the easel after it was placed and read the name on
itJere Westover Thats a funny name

Im glad it amuses you said the owner of it

Again the boy cast down his eyes discomfited and seemed again resolving
silently to bide his time and watch for another chance

Westover forgot him in the fidget he fell into trying this and that
effect with his head slanted one way and then slanted the other his
hand held up to shut out the mountain below the granite mass of Lions
Head and then changed to cut off the sky above and then both hands
lifted in parallel to confine the picture He made some tentative scrawls
on his canvas in charcoal and he wasted so much time that the light on
the mountainside began to take the rich tone of the afternoon deepening
to evening A soft flush stole into it the sun dipped behind the top
south of the mountain and Lions Head stood out against the intense
clearness of the west which began to be flushed with exquisite
suggestions of violet and crimson

Good Lord said Westover and he flew at his colors and began to paint
He had got his canvas into such a state that he alone could have found it
much more intelligible than his palette when he heard the boy saying
over his shoulder I dont think that looks very much like it He had
last been aware of the boy sitting at the grassy edge of the lane
tossing small bits of earth and pebble across to his dog which sat at
the other edge and snapped at them Then he lost consciousness of him He
answered dreamily while he found a tint he was trying for with his
brush Perhaps you dont know He was so sure of his effect that the
popular censure speaking in the boys opinion only made him happier in
it

I know what I see said the boy

I doubt it said Westover and then he lost consciousness of him again
He was rapt deep and far into the joy of his work and had no thought but
for that and for the dim question whether it would be such another day
tomorrow with that light again on Lions Head when he was at last
sensible of a noise that he felt he must have been hearing some time
without noting it It was a lamentable sound of screaming as of some
one in mortal terror mixed with wild entreaties Oh dont Jeff Oh
dont dont dont Oh please Oh do let us be Oh Jeff dont

Westover looked round bewildered and not able amid the clamor of the
echoes to make out where the cries came from Then down at the point
where the lane joined the road to the southward and the road lost itself
in the shadow of a woodland he saw the boy leaping back and forth across
the track with his dog beside him he was shouting and his dog barking
furiously those screams and entreaties came from within the shadow
Westover plunged down the lane headlong with a speed that gathered at
each bound and that almost flung him on his face when he reached the
level where the boy and the dog were dancing back and forth across the
road Then he saw crouching in the edge of the wood a little girl who
was uttering the appeals he had heard and clinging to her with a face
of frantic terror a child of five or six years her cries had grown
hoarse and had a hard mechanical action as they followed one another
They were really in no danger for the boy held his dog tight by his
collar and was merely delighting himself with their terror

The painter hurled himself upon him and with a quick grip upon his
collar gave him half a dozen flathanded blows wherever he could plant
them and then flung him reeling away

You infernal little ruffian he roared at him and the sound of his
voice was enough for the dog he began to scale the hillside toward the
house without a moments stay

The children still crouched together and Westover could hardly make them
understand that they were in his keeping when he bent over them and bade
them not be frightened The little girl set about wiping the childs eyes
on her apron in a motherly fashion her own were dry enough and Westover
fancied there was more of fury than of fright in her face She seemed
lost to any sense of his presence and kept on talking fiercely to
herself while she put the little boy in order like an indignant woman

Great mean ugly thing Ill tell the teacher on him thats what I
will as soon as ever school begins Ill see if he can come round with
that dog of his scaring folks I wouldnt a been a bit afraid if it
hadnt a been for Franky Dont cry any more Franky Dont you see
theyre gone I presume he thinks it smart to scare a little boy and a
girl If I was a boy once Id show him

She made no sign of gratitude to Westover as far as any recognition from
her was concerned his intervention was something as impersonal as if it
had been a thunderbolt falling upon her enemies from the sky

Where do you live he asked Ill go home with you if youll tell me
where you live

She looked up at him in a daze and Westover heard the Durgin boy saying
She lives right there in that little woodcolored house at the other end
of the lane There aint no call to go home with her

Westover turned and saw the boy kneeling at the edge of a clump of
bushes where he must have struck he was rubbing with a tuft of grass
at the dirt ground into the knees of his trousers

The little girl turned hawkishly upon him Not for anything you can do
Jeff Durgin

The boy did not answer

There she said giving a final pull and twitch to the dress of her
brother and taking him by the hand tenderly Now come right along
Franky

Let me have your other hand said Westover and with the little boy
between them they set off toward the point where the lane joined the
road on the northward They had to pass the bushes where Jeff Durgin was
crouching and the little girl turned and made a face at him Oh oh I
dont think I should have done that said Westover

I dont care said the little girl But she said in explanation and
partial excuse He tries to scare all the girls Ill let him know t he
cant scare one

Westover looked up toward the Durgin house with a return of interest in
the canvas he had left in the lane on the easel Nothing had happened to
it At the door of the barn he saw the farmer and his eldest son slanting
forward and staring down the hill at the point he had come from Mrs
Durgin was looking out from the shelter of the porch and she turned and
went in with Jeffs dog at her skirts when Westover came in sight with
the children




V

Westover had his tea with the family but nothing was said or done to
show that any of them resented or even knew of what had happened to the
boy from him Jeff himself seemed to have no grudge He went out with
Westover when the meal was ended and sat on the steps of the porch with
him watching the painter watch the light darken on the lonely heights
and in the lonely depths around Westover smoked a pipe and the fire
gleamed and smouldered in it regularly with his breathing the boy on a
lower step pulled at the long ears of his dog and gazed up at him

They were both silent till the painter asked What do you do here when
youre not trying to scare little children to death

The boy hung his head and said with the effect of excusing a long
arrears of uselessness Im goin to school as soon as it commences

Theres one branch of your education that I should like to undertake if
I ever saw you at a thing like that again Dont you feel ashamed of
yourself

The boy pulled so hard at the dogs ear that the dog gave a faint yelp of
protest

They might a seen that I had him by the collar I want agoin to
let go

Well the next time I have you by the collar I wont let go either
said the painter but he felt an inadequacy in his threat and he
imagined a superfluity and he made some haste to ask who are they

Whitwell is their name They live in that little house where you took
them Their fathers got a piece of land on Zions Head that hes
clearin off for the timber Their mothers dead and Cynthy keeps house
Shes always makin up names and faces added the boy She thinks
herself awful smart That Frankys a perfect crybaby

Well upon my word You are a little ruffian said Westover and he
knocked the ashes out of his pipe The next time you meet that poor
little creature you tell her that I think youre about the shabbiest chap
I know and that I hope the teacher will begin where I left off with you
and not leave blackguard enough in you to

He stopped for want of a fitting figure and the boy said I guess the
teacher wont touch me

Westover rose and the boy flung his dog away from him with his foot
Want I should show you where to sleep

Yes said Westover and the boy hulked in before him vanishing into
the dark of the interior and presently appeared with a lighted
handlamp He led the way upstairs to a front room looking down upon the
porch roof and over toward Zions Head which Westover could see dimly
outlined against the night sky when he lifted the edge of the paper
shade and peered out

The room was neat with greater comfort in its appointments than he hoped
for He tried the bed and found it hard but of straw and not the
feathers he had dreaded while the boy looked into the waterpitcher to
see if it was full and then went out without any form of goodnight

Westover would have expected to wash in a tin basin at the back door and
wipe on the family towel but all the means of toilet such as they were
he found at hand here and a surprise which he had felt at a certain
touch in the cooking renewed itself at the intelligent arrangements for
his comfort A secondary quilt was laid across the foot of his bed his
windowshade was pulled down and though the window was shut and the air
stuffy within there was a sense of cleanliness in everything which was
not at variance with the closeness

The bed felt fresh when he got into it and the sweet breath of the
mountains came in so cold through the sash he had lifted that he was glad
to pull the secondary quilt up over him He heard the clock tick in some
room below from another quarter came the muffled sound of coughing but
otherwise the world was intensely still and he slept deep and long




VI

The men folks had finished their breakfast and gone to their farmwork
hours before Westover came down to his breakfast but the boy seemed to
be of as much early leisure as himself and was lounging on the threshold
of the back door with his dog in waiting upon him He gave the effect of
yesterdays cleanliness freshened up with more recent soap and water At
the moment Westover caught sight of him he heard his mother calling to
him from the kitchen Well now come in and get your breakfast Jeff
and the boy called to Westover in turn Ill tell her youre here as
he rose and came indoors I guess shes got your breakfast for you

Mrs Durgin brought the breakfast almost as soon as Westover had found
his way to the table and she lingered as if for some expression of his
opinion upon it The biscuit and the butter were very good and he said
so the eggs were fresh and the hash from yesterdays cornedbeef could
not have been better and he praised them but he was silent about the
coffee

It ant very good she suggested

Why Im used to making my own coffee I lived so long in a country
where its nearly the whole of breakfast that I got into the habit of it
and I always carry my little machine with me but I dont like to bring
it out unless

Unless you cant stand the other folkss said the woman with a
humorous gleam Well you neednt mind me I want you should have good
coffee and I guess I ant too old to learn if you want to show me Our
folks dont care for it much they like tea and I kind of got out of the
way of it But at home we had to have it She explained to his
inquiring glance

My father kept the tavern on the old road to St Albans on the other
side of Lions Head Thats where I always lived till I married here

Oh said Westover and he felt that she had proudly wished to account
for a quality which she hoped he had noticed in her cooking He thought
she might be going to tell him something more of herself but she only
said Well any time you want to show me your way of makin coffee and
went out of the room

That evening which was the close of another flawless day he sat again
watching the light outside when he saw her come into the hallway with a
large shadelamp in her hand She stopped at the door of a room he had
not seen yet and looked out at him to ask

Wont you come in and set in the parlor if you want to

He found her there when he came in and her two sons with her the
younger was sleepily putting away some schoolbooks and the elder seemed
to have been helping him with his lessons

Hes got to begin school next week she said to Westover and at the
preparations the other now began to make with a piece of paper and a
planchette which he had on the table before him she asked in the
halfmocking halfdeprecating way which seemed characteristic of her
You believe any in that

I dont know that Ive ever seen it work said the painter

Well sometimes it wont work she returned altogether mockingly now
and sat holding her shapely hands which were neither so large nor so
rough as they might have been across her middle and watching her son
while the machine pushed about under his palm and he bent his wan eyes
upon one of the ovalframed photographs on the wall as if rapt in a
supernal vision The boy stared drowsily at the planchette jerking this
way and that and making abrupt starts and stops At last the young man
lifted his palm from it and put it aside to study the hieroglyphics it
had left on the paper

Whats it say asked his mother

The young man whispered I cant seem to make out very clear I guess I
got to take a little time to it he added leaning back wearily in his
chair Ever seen much of the manifestations he gasped at Westover

Never any before said the painter with a leniency for the invalid
which he did not feel for his belief

The young man tried for his voice and found enough of it to say
Theres a trance medium over at the Huddle Her control says t I can
develop into a writin medium He seemed to refer the fact as a sort of
question to Westover who could think of nothing to say but that it must
be very interesting to feel that one had such a power

I guess he dont know hes got it yet his mother interposed And
planchette dont seem to know either

We hant given it a fair trial yet said the young man impartially
almost impassively

Wouldnt you like to see it do some of your sums Jeff said the
mother to the drowsy boy blinking in a corner You better go to bed

The elder brother rose I guess Ill go too

The father had not joined their circle in the parlor now breaking up by
common consent

Mrs Durgin took up her lamp again and looked round on the appointments
of the room as if she wished Westover to note them too the drab
wallpaper the stiff chairs the long hard sofa in haircloth the high
bureau of mahogany veneer

You can come in here and set or lay down whenever you feel like it she
said We use it more than folks generally I presume we got in the
habit havin it open for funerals




VII

Four or five days of perfect weather followed one another and Westover
worked hard at his picture in the late afternoon light he had chosen for
it In the morning he tramped through the woods and climbed the hills
with Jeff Durgin who seemed never to do anything about the farm and had
a leisure unbroken by anything except a rare call from his mother to help
her in the house He built the kitchen fire and got the wood for it he
picked the belated pease and the early beans in the garden and shelled
them on the Monday when the school opened he did a share of the family
wash which seemed to have been begun before daylight and Westover saw
him hanging out the clothes before he started off with his books He
suffered no apparent loss of selfrespect in these employments and
while he still had his days free he put himself at Westovers disposal
with an effect of unimpaired equality He had expected evidently that
Westover would want to fish or shoot or at least join him in the hunt
for woodchucks which he still carried on with abated zeal for lack of
his company when the painter sat down to sketch certain bits that struck
him When he found that Westover cared for nothing in the way of sport
as people commonly understand it he did not openly contemn him He
helped him get the flowers he studied and he learned to know true
mushrooms from him though he did not follow his teaching in eating the
toadstools as his mother called them when they brought them home to be
cooked

If it could not be said that he shared the affection which began to grow
up in Westover from their companionship there could be no doubt of the
interest he took in him though it often seemed the same critical
curiosity which appeared in the eye of his dog when it dwelt upon the
painter Fox had divined in his way that Westover was not only not to be
molested but was to be respectfully tolerated yet no gleam of kindness
ever lighted up his face at sight of the painter he never wagged his
tail in recognition of him he simply recognized him and no more and he
remained passive under Westovers advances which he had the effect of
covertly referring to Jeff when the boy was by for his approval or
disapproval when he was not by the dogs manner implied a reservation
of opinion until the facts could be submitted to his master

On the Saturday morning which was the last they were to have together
the three comrades had strayed from the vague wood road along one of the
unexpected levels on the mountain slopes and had come to a standstill in
a place which the boy pretended not to know his way out of Westover
doubted him for he had found that Jeff liked to give himself credit for
woodcraft by discovering an escape from the depths of trackless
wildernesses

I guess you know where we are he suggested

No honestly said the boy but he grinned and Westover still doubted
him

Hark Whats that he said hushing further speech from him with a
motion of his hand It was the sound of an axe

Oh I know where we are said Jeff Its that Canuck chopping in
Whitwells clearing Come along

He led the way briskly down the mountainside now stopping from time to
time and verifying his course by the sound of the axe This came and
went and byandby it ceased altogether and Jeff crept forward with a
real or feigned uncertainty Suddenly he stopped A voice called Heigh
there and the boy turned and fled crashing through the underbrush at a
tangent with his dog at his heels

Westover looked after them and then came forward A lank figure of a man
at the foot of a poplar which he had begun to fell stood waiting him
one hand on his axehelve and the other on his hip There was the scent
of freshly smitten bark and sapwood in the air the ground was paved
with broad clean chips

Goodmorning said Westover

How are you returned the other without moving or making any sign of
welcome for a moment But then he lifted his axe and struck it into the
carf on the tree and came to meet Westover

As he advanced he held out his hand Oh youre the one that stopped
that fellow that day when he was tryin to scare my children Well I
thought I should run across you some time He shook hands with Westover
in token of the gratitude which did not express itself in words How are
you Treat you pretty well up at the Durgins I guess so The old woman
knows how to cook anyway Jacksons about the best o the lot above
ground though I dont know as I know very much against the old man
either But that boy I declare I most feel like takin the top of his
head off when he gets at his tricks Set down

Whitwell as Westover divined the man to be took a seat himself on a
high stump which suited his length of leg and courteously waved
Westover to a place on the log in front of him A long ragged beard of
brown with lines of gray in it hung from his chin and mounted well up
on his thin cheeks toward his friendly eyes His mustache lay sunken on
his lip which had fallen in with the loss of his upper teeth From the
lower jaw a few incisors showed at this slant and that as he talked

Well well he said with the air of wishing the talk to go on but
without having anything immediately to offer himself

Westover said Thank you as he dropped on the log and Whitwell added
relentingly I dont suppose a fellows so much to blame if hes got
the devil in him as what the devil is

He referred the point with a twinkle of his eyes to Westover who said
Its always a question of course whether its the devil It may be
original sin with the fellow himself

Well thats something so said Whitwell with pleasure in the
distinction rather than assent But I guess it aint original sin in the
boy Got it from his granfather pootty straight I should say and maybe
the old man had it secondhand Had to say just where so much cussedness
gits statted

His fathers father asked Westover willing to humor Whitwells
evident wish to philosophize the Durgins history

Mothers He kept the old tavern stand on the west side of Lions Head
on the St Albans Road and I guess he kept a pootty good house in the
old times when the stages stopped with him Ever noticed how a man on the
mean side in politics always knows how to keep a hotel Well its
something curious If there was ever a mean side to any question old
Mason was on it My folks used to live around there and I can remember
when I was a boy hangin around the barroom nights hearin him argue
that colored folks had no souls and along about the time the
fugitiveslave law was passed the folks pootty near run him out o town
for puttin the United States marshal on the scent of a fellow that was
breakin for Canada Well it was just so when the war come It was known
for a fact that he was in with them Secesh devils up over the line that
was plannin a raid into Vermont in 63 Hed got pootty low down by that
time railroads took off all the travel tavern d got to be a regular
doggery old man always drank some I guess That was a good while after
his girl had married Durgin He was dead against it and it broke him up
considable when she would have him Well one night the old stand burnt
up and him in it and neither of em insured

Whitwell laughed with a pleasure in his satire which gave the monuments
in his lower jaw a rather sinister action But as if he felt a rebuke in
Westovers silence he added There aint anything against Mis Durgin
Shes done her part and shes had more than her share of hard knocks If
she was tough to stat with shes had blows enough to meller her But
thats the way I account for the boy I sposeId oughtnt to feel the
way I do about him but hes such a pest to the whole neighborhood that
hed have the most popla funel Well I guess Ive said enough Im
much obliged to you though Mr

Westover the painter suggested But the boy isnt so bad all the
time

Couldnt be said Whitwell with a cackle of humorous enjoyment He
has his spells of bein decent and hes pootty smart too But when the
other spell ketches him its like as if the devil got ahold of him as I
said in the first place I lost my wife here twothree years along back
and that little girl you see him tormentin shes a regular little
mother to her brother and whenever Jeff Durgin sees her with him seems
as if the Old Scratch got into him Well Im glad I didnt come across
him that day How you gittin along with Lions Head Sets quiet enough
for you Whitwell rose from the stump and brushed the clinging chips
from his thighs Folks trouble you any lookin on

Not yet said Westover

Well there aint a great many to said Whitwell going back to his
axe I should like to see you workin some day Do know as I ever saw
an attist at it

I should like to have you said Westover Any time

All right Whitwell pulled his axe out of the carf and struck it in
again with a force that made a wide square chip leap out He looked over
his shoulder at Westover who was moving away Say stop in some time
youre passin I live in that woodcolored house at the foot of the
Durgins lane




VIII

In a little sunken place behind a rock some rods away Westover found
Jeff lurking with his dog both silent and motionless Hello he said
inquiringly

Come back to show you the way said the boy Thought you couldnt find
it alone

Oh why didnt you say youd wait The boy grinned I shouldnt think
a fellow like you would want to be afraid of any man even for the fun of
scaring a little girl Jeff stopped grinning and looked interested as
if this was a view of the case that had not occurred to him But perhaps
you like to be afraid

I dont know as I do said the boy and Westover left him to the
question a great part of the way home He did not express any regret or
promise any reparation But a few days after that when he had begun to
convoy parties of children up to see Westover at work in the late
afternoon on their way home from school and to show the painter off to
them as a sort of family property he once brought the young Whitwells
He seemed on perfect terms with them now and when the crowd of larger
children hindered the little boys view of the picture Jeff in his
quality of host lifted him under his arms and held him up so that he
could look as long as he liked

The girl seemed ashamed of the good understanding before Westover Jeff
offered to make a place for her among the other children who had looked
long enough but she pulled the front of her bonnet across her face and
said that she did not want to look and caught her brother by the hand
and ran away with him Westover thought this charming somewhat he liked
the intense shyness which the childs intense passion had hidden from him
before

Jeff acted as host to the neighbors who came to inspect the picture and
they all came within a circuit of several miles around and gave him
their opinions freely or scantily according to their several
temperaments They were mainly favorable though there was some frank
criticism too spoken over the painters shoulder as openly as if he
were not by There was no question but of likeness all finer facts were
far from them they wished to see how good a portrait Westover had made
and some of them consoled him with the suggestion that the likeness would
come out more when the picture got dry

Whitwell when he came attempted a larger view of the artists work but
apparently more out of kindness for him than admiration of the picture
He said he presumed you could not always get a thing like that just right
the first time and that you had to keep trying till you did get it but
it paid in the end Jeff had stolen down from the house with his dog
drawn by the fascination which one we have injured always has for us
when Whitwell suddenly turned upon him and asked jocularly What do you
think Jeff the boy could only kick his dog and drive it home as a
means of hiding his feelings

He brought the teacher to see the picture the last Friday before the
painter went away She was a coldlooking austere girl pretty enough
with eyes that wandered away from the young man although Jeff used all
his arts to make her feel at home in his presence She pretended to have
merely stopped on her way up to see Mrs Durgin and she did not venture
any comment on the painting but when Westover asked something about her
school she answered him promptly enough as to the number and ages and
sexes of the schoolchildren He ventured so far toward a joke with her
as to ask if she had much trouble with such a tough subject as Jeff and
she said he could be good enough when he had a mind If he could get over
his teasing she said with the air of reading him a lecture she would
not have anything to complain of and Jeff looked ashamed but rather of
the praise than the blame His humiliation seemed complete when she said
finally Hes a good scholar

On the Tuesday following Westover meant to go It was the end of his
third week and it had brought him into September The weather since he
had begun to paint Lions Head was perfect for his work but with the
long drought it had grown very warm Many trees now had flamed into
crimson on the hillslopes the yellowing corn in the fields gave out a
thin dry sound as the delicate wind stirred the blades but only the
sounds and sights were autumnal The heat was oppressive at midday and
at night the cold had lost its edge There was no dew and Mrs Durgin
sat out with Westover on the porch while he smoked a final pipe there
She had come to join him for some fixed purpose apparently and she
called to her boy You go to bed Jeff as if she wished to be alone
with Westover the men folks were already in bed he could hear them
cough now and then

Mr Westover the woman began even as she swept her skirts forward
before she sat down I want to ask you whether you would let that
picture of yours go on part board Ill give you back just as much as you
say of this money

He looked round and saw that she had in the hand dropped in her lap the
bills he had given her after supper

Why I couldnt very well Mrs Durgin he began

I presume youll think Im foolish she pursued But I do want that
picture I dont know when Ive ever wanted a thing more Its just like
Lions Head the way Ive seen it day in and day out every summer since
I come here thirtyfive years ago its beautiful

Mrs Durgin said Westover you gratify me more than I can tell you I
wishI wish I could let you have the picture II dont know what to
say

Why dont you let me have it then If we ever had to go away from
hereif anything happened to usits the one thing I should want to
keep and take with me There Thats the way I feel about it I cant
explain but I do wish youd let me have it

Some emotion which did not utter itself in the desire she expressed made
her voice shake in the words She held out the banknotes to him and
they rustled with the tremor of her hand

Mrs Durgin I suppose I shall have to be frank with you and you
mustnt feel hurt I have to live by my work and I have to get as much
as I can for it

Thats what I say I dont want to beat you down on it Ill give you
whatever you think is right Its my money and my husband feels just as
I do about it she urged

You dont quite understand he said gently I expect to have an
exhibition of my pictures in Boston this fall and I hope to get two or
three hundred dollars for Lions Head

Ive been a proper fool cried the woman and she drew in a long
breath

Oh dont mind he begged its all right Ive never had any offer
for a picture that Id rather take than yours I know the thing cant be
altogether bad after what youve said And Ill tell you what Ill have
it photographed when I get to Boston and Ill send you a photograph of
it

How much will that be Mrs Durgin asked as if taught caution by her
offer for the painting

Nothing And if youll accept it and hang it up here somewhere I shall
be very glad

Thank you said Mrs Durgin and the meekness the wounded pride he
fancied in her touched him

He did not know at first how to break the silence which she let follow
upon her words At last he said

You spoke just now about taking it with you Of course you dont
think of leaving Lions Head

She did not answer for so long a time that he thought she had not perhaps
heard him or heeded what he said but she answered finally We did
think of it The day you come we had about made up our minds to leave

Oh

But Ive been thinkin of something since youve been here that I dont
know but youll say is about as wild as wantin to buy a
threehundreddollar picture with a weeks board She gave a short
selfscornful laugh but it was a laugh and it relieved the tension

It may not be worth any more he said glad of the relief

Oh I guess it is she rejoined and then she waited for him to prompt
her

Well

Well its this and I wanted to ask you anyway You think thered be
any chance of my gettin summer folks to come here and board if I was to
put an advertisement in a Boston paper I know its a lonesome place and
there aint what you may call attractions But the folks from the hotels
sometimes when they ride over in a stage to see the view praise up the
scenery and I guess it is sightly I know that well enough and I aint
afraid but what I can do for boarders as well as some if not better
What do you think

I think thats a capital idea Mrs Durgin

Its that or go she said There aint a livin for us on the farm any
more and we got to do somethin If there was anything else I could do
But Ive thought it out and thought it out and I guess there aint
anything I can do but take boardersif I can get them

I should think youd find it rather pleasant on some accounts Your
boarders would be company for you said Westover

Were company enough for ourselves said Mrs Durgin I aint ever
been lonesome here from the first minute I guess I had company enough
when I was a girl to last me the sort that hotel folks are I presume Mr
Whitwell spoke to you about my father

Yes he did Mrs Durgin

I dont presume he said anything that want true Its all right But I
know how my mother used to slave and how I used to slave myself and I
always said Id rather do anything than wait on boarders and now I guess
I got to come to it The sight of summer folks makes me sick I guess I
could a had em long ago if Id wanted to There Ive said enough
She rose with a sudden lift of her powerful frame and stood a moment as
if expecting Westover to say something

He said Well when youve made your mind up send your advertisement to
me and Ill attend to it for you

And you wont forget about the picture

No I wont forget that

The next morning he made ready for an early start and in his
preparations he had the zealous and even affectionate help of Jeff
Durgin The boy seemed to wish him to carry away the best impression of
him or at least to make him forget all that had been sinister or
unpleasant in his behavior They had been good comrades since the first
evil day they had become good friends even and Westover was touched by
the boys devotion at parting He helped the painter get his pack
together in good shape and he took pride in strapping it on Westovers
shoulders adjusting and readjusting it with care and fastening it so
that all should be safe and snug He lingered about at the risk of being
late for school as if to see the last of the painter and he waved his
hat to him when Westover looked back at the house from half down the
lane Then he vanished and Westover went slowly on till he reached that
corner of the orchard where the slanting gravestones of the family
burialground showed above the low wall There suddenly a storm burst
upon him The air rained apples that struck him on the head the back
the side and pelted in violent succession on his knapsack and canvases
campstool and easel He seemed assailed by four or five skilful
marksmen whose missiles all told

When he could lift his face to look round he heard a shrill accusing
voice Oh Jeff Durgin and he saw another storm of apples fly through
the air toward the little Whitwell girl who dodged and ran along the
road below and escaped in the direction of the schoolhouse Then the
boys face showed itself over the top of one of the gravestones all
agrin with joy He waited and watched Westover keep slowly on as if
nothing had happened and presently he let some apples fall from his
hands and walked slowly back to the house with his dog at his heels

When Westover reached the level of the road and the shelter of the woods
near Whitwells house he unstrapped his load to see how much harm had
been done to his picture He found it unhurt and before he had got the
burden back again he saw Jeff Durgin leaping along the road toward the
schoolhouse whirling his satchel of books about his head and shouting
gayly to the girl now hidden by the bushes at the other end of the lane
Cynthy Oh Cynthy Wait for me I want to tell you something




IX

Westover received next spring the copy for an advertisement from Mrs
Durgin which she asked to have him put in some paper for her She said
that her son Jackson had written it out and Westover found it so well
written that he had scarcely to change the wording It offered the best
of farmboard with plenty of milk and eggs berries and fruit for five
dollars a week at Lions Head Farm and it claimed for the farm the merit
of the finest view of the celebrated Lions Head Mountain It was signed
as her letter was signed Mrs J M Durgin with her postoffice
address and it gave Westover as a reference

The letter was in the same handwriting as the advertisement which he
took to be that of Jackson Durgin It enclosed a dollar note to pay for
three insertions of the advertisement in the evening Transcript and it
ended almost casually I do not know as you have heard that my husband
James Monroe Durgin passed to spirit life this spring My son will help
me to run the house

This death could not move Westover more than it had apparently moved the
widow During the three weeks he had passed under his roof he had
scarcely exchanged three words with James Monroe Durgin who remained to
him an impression of large round dullblue eyes a stubbly upper lip
and cheeks and chin tagged with coarse haycolored beard The impression
was so largely the impression that he had kept of the dullblue eyes and
the gaunt slanted figure of Andrew Jackson Durgin that he could not be
very distinct in his sense of which was now the presence and which the
absence He remembered with an effort that the sons beard was
strawcolored but he had to make no effort to recall the robust effect
of Mrs Durgin and her youngest son He wondered now as he had often
wondered before whether she knew of the final violence which had avenged
the boy for the prolonged strain of repression Jeff had inflicted upon
himself during Westovers stay at the farm After several impulses to go
back and beat him to follow him to school and expose him to the teacher
to write to his mother and tell her of his misbehavior Westover had
decided to do nothing As he had come off unhurt in person and property
he could afford to be more generously amused than if he had suffered
damage in either The more he thought of the incident the more he was
disposed to be lenient with the boy whom he was aware of having baffled
and subdued by his superior wit and virtue in perhaps intolerable
measure He could not quite make out that it was an act of bad faith
there was no reason to think that the goodnatured things the fellow had
done the constant little offices of zeal and friendliness were less
sincere than this violent outbreak

The letter from Lions Head Farm brought back his three weeks there very
vividly and made Westover wish he was going there for the summer But he
was going over to France for an indefinite period of work in the only air
where he believed modern men were doing good things in the right way He
W a sale in the winter and he had sold pictures enough to provide the
means for this sojourn abroad though his lions Head Mountain had not
brought the two hundred and fifty or three hundred dollars he had hoped
for It brought only a hundred and sixty but the time had almost come
already when Westover thought it brought too much Now the letter from
Mrs Durgin reminded him that he had never sent her the photograph of the
picture which he had promised her He encased the photograph at once and
wrote to her with many avowals of contrition for his neglect and strong
regret that he was not soon to see the original of the painting again He
paid a decent reverence to the bereavement she had suffered and he sent
his regards to all especially his comrade Jeff whom he advised to keep
out of the appleorchard

Five years later Westover came home in the first week of a gasping
August whose hot breath thickened round the Cunarder before she got
halfway up the harbor He waited only to see his pictures through the
customhouse and then he left for the mountains The mountains meant
Lions Head for him and eight hours after he was dismounting from the
train at a station on the road which had been pushed through on a new
line within four miles of the farm It was called Lions Head House now
as he read on the side of the mountainwagon which he saw waiting at the
platform and he knew at a glance that it was Jeff Durgin who was coming
forward to meet him and take his handbag

The boy had been the prophecy of the man in even a disappointing degree
Westover had fancied him growing up to the height of his father and
brother but Jeff Durgins stalwart frame was notable for strength rather
than height He could not have been taller than his mother whose stature
was above the standard of her sex but he was massive without being
bulky His chest was deep his square shoulders broad his powerful legs
bore him with a backward bulge of the calves that showed through his
shapely trousers he caught up the trunks and threw them into the
baggagewagon with a swelling of the muscles on his short thick arms
which pulled his coatsleeves from his heavy wrists and broad short
hands

He had given one of these to Westover to shake when they met but with
something conditional in his welcome and with a look which was not so
much furtive as latent The thatch of yellow hair he used to wear was now
cropped close to his skull which was a sort of duncolor and it had
some drops of sweat along the lighter edge where his hat had shaded his
forehead He put his hat on the seat between himself and Westover and
drove away from the station bareheaded to cool himself after his bout
with the baggage which was following more slowly in its wagon There was
a good deal of it and there were half a dozen peoplewomen of
coursegoing to Lions Head House Westover climbed to the place beside
Jeff to let them have the other two seats to themselves and to have a
chance of talking but the ladies had to be quieted in their several
anxieties concerning their baggage and the letters and telegrams they
had sent about their rooms before they settled down to an exchange of
apprehensions among themselves and left Jeff Durgin free to listen to
Westover

I dont know but I ought to have telegraphed you that I was coming
Westover said but I couldnt realize that you were doing things on the
hotel scale Perhaps you wont have room for me

Guess we can put you up said Jeff

No chance of getting my old room I suppose

I shouldnt wonder If theres any one in it I guess mother could
change em

Is that so asked Westover with a liking for being liked which his
tone expressed How is your mother

Jeff seemed to think a moment before he answered

Just exactly the same

A little older

Not as I can see

Does she hate keeping a hotel as badly as she expected

Thats what she says answered Jeff with a twinkle All the time
while he was talking with Westover he was breaking out to his horses
which he governed with his voice trotting them up hill and down and
walking them on the short infrequent levels in the mountain fashion

Westover almost feared to ask And how is Jackson

Firstratethat is for him Hes as well as ever he was I guess and
he dont appear a day older Youve changed some said Jeff with a look
round at Westover

Yes Im twentynine now and I wear a heavier beard Westover noticed
that Jeff was clean shaved of any sign of an approaching beard and
artistically he rejoiced in the fellows young manly beauty which was
very regular and sculpturesque Youre about eighteen

Nearer nineteen

Is Jackson as much interested in the other world as he used to be

Spirits

Yes

I guess he keeps it up with Mr Whitwell He dont say much about it at
home He keeps all the books and helps mother run the house She
couldnt very well get along without him

And where do you come in

Well I look after the transportation said Jeff with a nod toward his
horseswhen Im at home that is Ive been at the Academy in Lovewell
the last three winters and that means a good piece of the summer too
first and last But I guess Ill let mother talk to you about that

All right said Westover What I dont know about education isnt
worth knowing

Jeff laughed and said to the off horse which seemed to know that he was
meant Get up there

And Cynthia Is Cynthia at home Westover asked

Yes theyre all down in the little woodcolored house yet Cynthia
teaches winters and summers she helps mother She has charge of the
diningroom

Does Franky cry as much as ever

No Franks a fine boy Hes in the house too Kind of bellboy

And you havent worked Mr Whitwell in anywhere

Well he talks to the ladies and takes parties of em
mountainclimbing I guess we couldnt get along without Mr Whitwell He
talks religion to em He cast a mocking glance at Westover over his
shoulder Women seem to like religion whether they belong to church or
not

Westover laughed and asked And Fox Hows Fox

Well said Jeff we had to give Fox away He was always cross with the
boarders children My brother was on from Colorado and he took Fox back
with him

I didnt suppose said Westover that I should have been sorry to miss
Fox But I guess I shall be

Jeff seemed to enjoy the implication of his words He wasnt a bad dog
He was stupid

When they arrived at the foot of the lane mounting to the farm Westover
saw what changes had been made in the house There were large additions
tasteless and characterless but giving the rooms that were needed There
was a vulgar modernity in the new parts expressed with a final intensity
in the fourlight windows which are esteemed the last word of domestic
architecture in the country Jeff said nothing as they approached the
house but Westover said Well youve certainly prospered Youre quite
magnificent

They reached the old level in front of the house artificially widened
out of his remembrance with a white flagpole planted at its edge and
he looked up at the front of the house which was unchanged except that
it had been built a story higher back of the old front and discovered
the window of his old room He could hardly wait to get his greetings
over with Mrs Durgin and Jackson who both showed a decorous pleasure
and surprise at his coming before he asked

And could you let me have my own room Mrs Durgin

Why yes she said if you dont want something a little nicer

I dont believe youve got anything nicer Westover said

All right if you think so she retorted You can have the old room
anyway




X

Westover could not have said he felt very much at home on his first
sojourn at the farm or that he had cared greatly for the Durgins But
now he felt very much at home and as if he were in the hands of friends

It was toward the close of the afternoon that he arrived and he went in
promptly to the meal that was served shortly after He found that the
farmhouse had not evolved so far in the direction of a hotel as to have
reached the stage of a late dinner It was tea that he sat down to but
when he asked if there were not something hot after listening to a
catalogue of the cold meats the spectacled waitress behind his chair
demanded with the air of putting him on his honor

You among those that came this afternoon

Westover claimed to be of the new arrivals

Well then you can have steak or chops and baked potatoes

He found the steak excellent though succinct and he looked round in the
distinction it conferred upon him on the older guests who were served
with cold ham tongue and cornedbeef He had expected to be appointed
his place by Cynthia Whitwell but Jeff came to the diningroom with him
and showed him to the table he occupied with an effect of doing him
special credit

From his impressions of the berries the cream the toast and the tea
as well as the steak he decided that on the gastronomic side there could
be no question but the Durgins knew how to keep a hotel and his further
acquaintance with the house and its appointments confirmed him in his
belief All was very simple but sufficient and no guest could have
truthfully claimed that he was stinted in towels in water in
lamplight in the quantity or quality of bedding in hooks for clothes
or wardrobe or bureau room Westover made Mrs Durgin his sincere
compliments on her success as they sat in the old parlor which she had
kept for herself much in its former state and she accepted them with
simple satisfaction

But I dont know as I should ever had the courage to try it if it hadnt
been for you happening along just when you did she said

Then Im the founder of your fortunes

If you want to call them fortunes We dont complain Its been a fight
but I guess weve got the best of it The house is full and were
turnin folks away I guess they cant say that at the big hotels they
used to drive over from to see Lions Head at the farm She gave a low
comfortable chuckle and told Westover of the struggle they had made It
was an interesting story and pathetic like all stories of human endeavor
the efforts of the most selfish ambition have something of this interest
and the struggle of the Durgins had the grace of the wish to keep their
home

And is Jeff as well satisfied as the rest Westover asked after other
talk and comment on the facts

Too much so said Mrs Durgin I should like to talk with you about
Jeff Mr Westover you and him was always such friends

Yes said Westover I shall be glad if I can be of use to you

Why its just this I dont see why Jeff shouldnt do something besides
keep a hotel

Westovers eyes wandered to the photograph of his painting of Lions Head
which hung over the mantelpiece in what he felt to be the place of the
greatest honor in the whole house and a sudden fear came upon him that
perhaps Jeff had developed an artistic talent in the belief of his
family But he waited silently to hear

We did think that before we got through the improvements last spring a
year ago we should have to get the savingsbank to put a mortgage on the
place but we had just enough to start the season with and we thought we
would try to pull through We had a splendid season and made money and
this year were doin so well that I aint afraid for the future any
more and I want to give Jeff a chance in the world I want he should go
to college

Westover felt all the boldness of the aspiration but it was at least not
in the direction of art Wouldnt you rather miss him in the
management

We should some But he would be here the best part of the summer in
his vacations and Jackson and I are full able to run the house without
him

Jackson seems very well said Westover evasively

Hes better Hes only thirtyfour years old His father lived to be
sixty and he had the same kind Jeff tell you he had been at Lovewell
Academy

Yes he did

He done well there All his teachers that he ever had Mrs Durgin went
on with the motherpride that soon makes itself tiresome to the
listener said Jeff done well at school when he had a mind to and at
the Academy he studied real hard I guess said Mrs Durgin with her
chuckle that he thought that was goin to be the end of it One thing
he had to keep up with Cynthy and that put him on his pride You seen
Cynthy yet

No Jeff told me she was in charge of the diningroom

I guess Im in charge of the whole house said Mrs Durgin Cynthys
the housekeeper though Shes a fine girl and a smart girl said Mrs
Durgin with a visible relenting from some grudge and shell do well
wherever you put her She went to the Academy the first two winters Jeff
did Weve about scooped in the whole Whitwell family Frankys here and
his fatherswell his fathers kind of philosopher to the lady
boarders Mrs Durgin laughed and Westover laughed with her Yes I
want Jeff should go to college and I want he should be a lawyer

Westover did not find that he had anything useful to say to this so he
said Ive no doubt its better than being a painter

Im not so sure three hundred dollars for a little thing like that
She indicated the photograph of his Lions Head and she was evidently so
proud of it that he reserved for the moment the truth as to the price he
had got for the painting I was surprised when you sent me a photograph
full as big I dont let every one in here but a good many of the ladies
are artists themselvesamateurs I guessand first and last they all
want to see it I guess theyll all want to see you Mr Westover
Theyll be wild as they call it when they know youre in the house
Yes I mean Jeff shall go to college

Bowdoin or Dartmouth Westover suggested

Well I guess youll think Im about as forthputting as I was when I
wanted you to give me a threehundreddollar picture for a weeks board

I only got a hundred and sixty Mrs Durgin said Westover
conscientiously

Well its a shame Any rate three hundreds the price to all my
boarders My if Ive told that story once I guess Ive told it fifty
times

Mrs Durgin laughed at herself jollily and Westover noted how prosperity
had changed her It had freed her tongue it has brightened her humor it
had cheered her heart she had put on flesh and her stalwart frame was
now a far greater bulk than he remembered

Well there she said the long and the short of it is I want Jeff
should go to Harvard

He commanded himself to say I dont see why he shouldnt

Mrs Durgin called out Come in Jackson and Westover looked round and
saw the elder son like a gaunt shadow in the doorway Ive just got
where Ive told Mr Westover where I want Jeff should go It dont seem
to have cad him off his feet any either

I presume said Jackson coming in and sitting lankly down in the
feathercushioned rockingchair which his mother pushed toward him with
her foot that the expense would be more at Harvard than it would at the
other colleges

If you want the best you got to pay for it said Mrs Durgin

I suppose it would cost more Westover answered Jacksons conjecture
I really dont know much about it One hears tremendous stories at
Boston of the rate of living among the swell students in Cambridge
People talk of five thousand a year and that sort of thing Mrs Durgin
shut her lips after catching her breath But I fancy that its largely
talk I have a friend whose son went through Harvard for a thousand a
year and I know that many fellows do it for much less

I guess we can manage to let Jeff have a thousand a year said Mrs
Durgin proudly and not scrimp very much either

She looked at her elder son who said I dont believe but what we
could Its more of a question with me what sort of influence Jeff would
come under there I think hes pretty much spoiled here

Now Jackson said his mother

Ive heard said Westover that Harvard takes the nonsense out of a
man I cant enter into what you say and it isnt my affair but in
regard to influence at Harvard it depends upon the set Jeff is thrown
with or throws himself with So at least I infer from what Ive heard
my friend say of his son there There are hardworking sets loafing
sets and fast sets and I suppose it isnt different at Harvard in such
matters from other colleges

Mrs Durgin looked a little grave Of course she said we dont know
anybody at Cambridge except some ladies that boarded with us one summer
and I shouldnt want to ask any favor of them The trouble would be to
get Jeff started right

Westover surmised a good many things but in the absence of any
confidences from the Durgins he could not tell just how much Jackson
meant in saying that Jeff was pretty much spoiled or how little At
first from Mrs Durgins prompt protest he fancied that Jackson meant
that the boy had been overindulged by his mother I understand he
said in default of something else to say that the requirements at
Harvard are pretty severe

Hes passed his preliminary examinations said Jackson with a touch of
hauteur and I guess he can enter this fall if we should so decide
Hell have some conditions probly but none but what he can work off I
guess

Then if you wish to have him go to college by all means let him go to
Harvard I should say Its our great university and our oldest Im not
a college man myself but if I were I should wish to have been a
Harvard man If Jeff has any nonsense in him it will take it out and I
dont believe theres anything in Harvard as Harvard to make him
worse

Thats what we both think said Jackson

Ive heard Westover continued and he rose and stood while he spoke
that Harvards like the world A man gets on there on the same terms
that he gets on in the world He has to be a man and hed better be a
gentleman

Mrs Durgin still looked serious Have you come back to Boston for good
now Do you expect to be there right along

Ive taken a studio there Yes I expect to be in Boston now Ive taken
to teaching and I fancy I can make a living If Jeff comes to Cambridge
and I can be of any use

We should be ever so much obliged to you said his mother with an air
of great relief

Not at all I shall be very glad Your mountain air is drugging me Mrs
Durgin I shall have to say goodnight or I shall tumble asleep before I
get upstairs Oh I can find the way I guess this part of the house
seems the same He got away from them and with the lamp that Jackson
gave him found his way to his room A few moments later some one knocked
at his door and a boy stood there with a pitcher Some icewater Mr
Westover

Why is that you Franky Im glad to see you again How are you

Im pretty well said the boy shyly He was a very handsome little
fellow of distinctly dignified presence and Westover was aware at once
that here was not a subject for patronage Is there anything else you
want Mr Westover Matches or soap or anything He put the pitcher
down and gave a keen glance round the room

No everything seems to be here Frank said Westover

Well goodnight said the boy and he slipped out quietly closing the
door after him

Westover pushed up his window and looked at Lions Head in the moonlight
It slumbered as if with the sleep of centuriesaustere august The
moonrays seemed to break and splinter on the outline of the lionshape
and left all the mighty mass black below

In the old porch under his window Westover heard whispering Then You
behave yourself Jeff Durgin came in a voice which could be no other
than Cynthia Whitwells and Jeff Durgins laugh followed

He saw the girl in the morning She met him at the door of the
diningroom and he easily found in her shy proud manner and her pure
cold beauty the temperament and physiognomy of the child he remembered
She was tall and slim and she held herself straight without stiffness
her face was fine with a straight nose and a decided chin and a mouth
of the same sweetness which looked from her still gray eyes her hair
of the average brown had a rough effect of being quickly tossed into
form which pleased him as she slipped down the room before him to place
him at table he saw that she was as it were involuntarily unwillingly
graceful She made him think of a wild sweetbrier of a hermitthrush
but if there were this sort of poetic suggestion in Cynthias looks her
acts were of plain and honest prose such as giving Westover the
pleasantest place and the most intelligent waitress in the room

He would have liked to keep her in talk a moment but she made
businesslike despatch of all his allusions to the past and got herself
quickly away Afterward she came back to him with the effect of having
forced herself to come and the color deepened in her cheeks while she
stayed

She seemed glad of his being there but helpless against the instincts or
traditions that forbade her to show her pleasure in his presence Her
reticence became almost snubbing in its strictness when he asked her
about her schoolteaching in the winter but he found that she taught at
the little schoolhouse at the foot of the hill and lived at home with
her father

And have you any bad boys that frighten little girls in your school he
asked jocosely

I dont know as I have she said with a consciousness that flamed into
her cheeks

Perhaps the boys have reformed Westover suggested

I presume she said stiffly that theres room for improvement in
every one and then as if she were afraid he might take this
personally she looked unhappy and tried to speak of other things She
asked him if he did not see a great many changes at Lions Head he
answered gravely that he wished he could have found it just as he left
it and then she must have thought she had gone wrong again for she left
him in an embarrassment that was pathetic but which was charming




XI

After breakfast Westover walked out and saw Whitwell standing on the
grass in front of the house beside the flagstaff He suffered Westover
to make the first advances toward the renewal of their acquaintance but
when he was sure of his friendly intention he responded with a cordial
openness which the painter had fancied wanting in his children Whitwell
had not changed much The most noticeable difference was the compact
phalanx of new teeth which had replaced the staggering veterans of former
days and which displayed themselves in his smile of relenting There was
some novelty of effect also in an arrangement of things in his hatband
At first Westover thought they were fishhooks and artificial flies such
as the guides wear in the Adirondacks to advertise their calling about
the hotel offices and the piazzas But another glance showd him that they
were sprays and wild flowers of various sorts with gay mosses and fungi
and some stems of Indianpipe

Whitwell seemed pleased that these things should have caught Westovers
eye He said almost immediately Lookin at my almanac This is one of
our fielddays we have em once a week and I like to let the ladies see
beforehand what natures got on the bill for em in the woods and
pasturs

Its a good idea said Westover and its fresh and picturesque
Whitwell laughed for pleasure

They told me what a consolation you were to the ladies with your walks
and talks

Well I try to give em something to think about said Whitwell

But why do you confine your ministrations to one sex

I dont on purpose But its the only sex here threefourths of the
time Even the children are mostly all girls When the husbands come up
Saturday nights they dont want to go on a tramp Sundays They want to
lay off and rest Thats about how it is Well you see some changes
about Lions Head I presume he asked with what seemed an impersonal
pleasure in them

I should rather have found the old farm But I must say Im glad to find
such a good hotel

Jeff and his mother made their brags to you said Whitwell with a kind
of amiable scorn I guess if it want for Cynthy she wouldnt know
where she was standin half the time It dont matter where Jeff stands
I guess Jacksons the best o the lot now the old mans gone There
was no one by at the moment to hear these injuries except Westover but
Whitwell called them out with a frankness which was perhaps more
carefully adapted to the situation than it seemed Westover made no
attempt to parry them formally but he offered some generalities in
extenuation of the unworthiness of the Durgins which Whitwell did not
altogether refuse

Oh its all right Old woman talk to you about Jeffs going to college
I thought so Wants to make another Danel Webster of him Guess she
cans far forth as Danels graduatin went Westover tried to remember
how this had been with the statesman but could not Whitwell added with
intensifying irony so of look and tone Guess the second Danel wont
have a chance to tear his degree up guess he wouldnt ever ben ready to
try for it if it had depended on him They dont keep any record at
Harvard do they of the way fellows are prepared for their preliminary
examinations

I dont quite know what you mean said Westover

Oh nothin You get a chance some time to ask Jeff who done most of his
studyin for him at the Academy

This hint was not so darkling but Westover could understand that Whitwell
attributed Jeffs scholarship to the help of Cynthia but he would not
press him to an open assertion of the fact There was something painful
in it to him it had the pathos which perhaps most of the success in the
world would reveal if we could penetrate its outside

He was silent and Whitwell left the point Well he concluded whats
goin on in them old European countries

Oh the old thing said Westover But I cant speak for any except
France very well

Whats their republic like over there Ours See anything of it how it
works

Well you know said Westover I was working so hard myself all the
time

Good Whitwell slapped his leg Westover saw that he had on long
Indiarubber boots which came up to his knees and he gave a wayward
thought to the misery they would be on an August day to another man but
Whitwell was probably insensible to any discomfort from them When a
mans mindin his own business any governments good I guess But I
should like to prowl round some them places where they had the worst
scenes of the Revolution Ever been in the Place de la Concorde
Whitwell gave it the full English pronunciation

I passed through it nearly every day

I want to know And that column that they pulled down in the Commune
that had that little Boney on itsee that

In the Place Vendome

Yes Plass Vonndome

Oh yes You wouldnt know it had ever been down

Nor the things it stood for

As to that I cant be so sure

Well its funny said the philosopher how the world seems to always
come out at the same hole it went in at He paused with his mouth open
as if to let the notion have full effect with Westover

The painter said And youre still in the old place Mr Whitwell

Yes I like my own house Theyve wanted me to come up here often
enough but Im satisfied where I am Its quiet down there and when I
get through for the day I can read And I like to keep my family
together Cynthy and Frank always sleep at home and Jombateeste eats
with me You remember Jombateeste

Westover had to say that he did not

Well I dont know as you did see him much He was that Canuck I had
helpin me clear that piece over on Lions Head for the pulpmill
pulpmill went all to thunder and I never got a cent And sometimes
Jackson comes down with his plantchette and we have a good time

Jackson still believes in the manifestations

Yes But hes never developed much himself He cant seem to do much
without the plantchette Weve had up some of them old philosophers
lately Weve had up Socrates

Is that so It must be very interesting

Whitwell did not answer and Westover saw his eye wander He looked
round Several ladies were coming across the grass toward him from the
hotel lifting their skirts and tiptoeing through the dew They called to
him Goodmorning Mr Whitwell and Are you going up Lions Head
today and Dont you think it will rainGuess not said Whitwell
with a fatherly urbanity and an air of amusement at the anxieties of the
sex which seemed habitual to him He waited tranquilly for them to come
up and then asked with a wave of his hand toward Westover Acquainted
with Mr Westover the attist He named each of them and it would have
been no great vanity in Westover to think they had made their little
movement across the grass quite as much in the hope of an introduction to
him as in the wish to consult Whitwell about his plans

The painter found himself the centre of an agreeable excitement with all
the ladies in the house For this it was perhaps sufficient to be a man
To be reasonably young and decently goodlooking to be an artist and an
artist not unknown were advantages which had the splendor of
superfluity

He liked finding himself in the simple and innocent American circumstance
again and he was not sorry to be confronted at once with one of the most
characteristic aspects of our summer He could read in the present
development of Lions Head House all the history of its evolution from
the first conception of farmboard which sufficed the earliest comers
to its growth in the comforts and conveniences which more fastidious
tastes and larger purses demanded Before this point was reached the
boarders would be of a good and wholesome sort but they would be people
of no social advantages and not of much cultivation though they might
be intelligent they would certainly not be fashionable five dollars a
week implied all that except in the case of some wandering artist or the
family of some poor young professor But when the farm became a
boardinghouse and called itself a hotel as at present with Lions Head
House and people paid ten dollars a week or twelve for transients a
moment of its character was reached which could not be surpassed when its
prosperity became greater and its inmates more pretentious In fact the
people who can afford to pay ten dollars a week for summer board and not
much more are often the best of the American people or at least of
the New England people They may not know it and those who are richer
may not imagine it They are apt to be middleaged maiden ladies from
university towns living upon carefully guarded investments young
married ladies with a scant child or two and needing rest and change of
air college professors with nothing but their modest salaries literary
men or women in the beginning of their tempered success clergymen and
their wives away from their churches in the larger country towns or the
smaller suburbs of the cities here and there an agreeable bachelor in
middle life fond of literature and nature hosts of young and pretty
girls with distinct tastes in art and devoted to the clever young
painter who leads them to the sources of inspiration in the fields and
woods Such people are refined humane appreciative sympathetic and
Westover fresh from the life abroad where life is seldom so free as ours
without some stain was glad to find himself in the midst of this
unrestraint which was so sweet and pure He had seen enough of rich
people to know that riches seldom bought the highest qualities even
among his fellowcountrymen who suppose that riches can do everything
and the first aspects of society at Lions Head seemed to him Arcadian
There really proved to be a shepherd or two among all that troop of
shepherdesses old and young though it was in the middle of the week
remote alike from the Saturday of arrivals and the Monday of departures
To be sure there was none quite so young as himself except Jeff Durgin
who was officially exterior to the social life

The painter who gave lessons to the ladies was already a man of forty
and he was strongly dragoned round by a wife almost as old who had taken
great pains to secure him for herself and who worked him to far greater
advantage in his profession than he could possibly have worked himself
she got him orders sold his pictures even in Boston where they never
buy American pictures found him pupils and kept the boldest of these
from flirting with him Westover who was so newly from Paris was able
to console him with talk of the salons and ateliers which he had not
heard from so directly in ten years After the first inevitable moment of
jealousy his wife forgave Westover when she found that he did not want
pupils and she took a leading part in the movement to have him read
Browning at a picnic organized by the ladies shortly after he came




XII

The picnic was held in Whitwells Clearing on the side of Lions Head
where the moss almost as white as snow lay like belated drifts among
the tall thin grass which overran the space opened by the axe and crept
to the verge of the low pines growing in the shelter of the loftier
woods It was the end of one of Whitwells Tramps Home to Nature as he
called his walks and talks with the ladies and on this day Westovers
fellowpainter had added to his lessons in woodlore the claims of art
intending that his class should make studies of various bits in the
clearing and should try to catch something of its peculiar charm He
asked Westover what he thought of the notion and Westover gave it his
approval which became enthusiastic when he saw the place He found in it
the melancholy grace the poignant sentiment of ruin which expresses
itself in some measure wherever man has invaded nature and then left his
conquest to her again In Whitwells Clearing the effect was intensified
by the approach on the fading wood road which the wagons had made in
former days when they hauled the fallen timber to the pulpmill In
places it was so vague and faint as to be hardly a trail in others
where the wheeltracks remained visible the trees had sent out a new
growth of lower branches in the place of those lopped away and almost
forbade the advance of footpassengers The ladies said they did not see
how Jeff was ever going to get through with the wagon and they expressed
fears for the lunch he was bringing which seemed only too well grounded

But Whitwell who was leading them on said You let a Durgin alone to
do a thing when hes made up his mind to it I guess youll have your
lunch all right and by the time that they had got enough of Browning
they heard the welcome sound of wheels crashing upon dead boughs and
swishing through the underbrush and in the pauses of these pleasant
noises the voice of Jeff Durgin encouraging his horses The children of
the party broke away to meet him and then he came in sight ahead of his
team looking strong and handsome in his keeping with the scene Before
he got within hearing the ladies murmured a hymn of praise to his type
of beauty they said he looked like a young Hercules and Westover owned
with an inward smile that Jeff had certainly made the best of himself for
the time being He had taken a leaf from the book of the summer folks
his stalwart calves revealed themselves in thick ribbed stockings he
wore knickerbockers and a Norfolk jacket of corduroy he had style as
well as beauty and he had the courage of his clothes and looks Westover
was still in the first surprise of the American facts and he wondered
just what part in the picnic Jeff was to bear socially He was neither
quite host nor guest but no doubt in the easy play of the life which
Westover was rather proud to find so charming the question would solve
itself rationally and gracefully

Where do you want the things the young fellow asked of the company at
large as he advanced upon them from the green portals of the roadway
pulling off his soft wool hat and wiping his wet forehead with his
bluebordered white handkerchief

Oh right here Jeff The nimblest of the nymphs sprang to her feet
from the lounging and crouching circle about Westover She was a young
nymph no longer but with a daughter not so much younger than herself as
to make the contrast of her sixteen years painful Westover recognized
the officious selfapproving kind of the woman but he admired the brisk
efficiency with which she had taken possession of the affair from the
beginning and inspired every one to help in strict subordination to
herself

When the cloths were laid on the smooth elastic moss and the meal was
spread she heaped a plate without suffering any interval in her
activities

I suppose youve got to go back to your horses Jeff and you shall be
the first served she said and she offered him the plate with a bright
smile and friendly grace which were meant to keep him from the hurt of
her intention

Jeff did not offer to take the plate which she raised to him from where
she was kneeling but looked down at her with perfect intelligence I
guess I dont want anything he said and turned and walked away into
the woods

The illadvised woman remained kneeling for a moment with her
ingratiating smile hardening on her face while the sense of her blunder
petrified the rest She was the first to recover herself and she said
with a laugh that she tried to make reckless Well friends I suppose
the rest of you are hungry I know I am and she began to eat

The others ate too though their appetites might well have been affected
by the diplomatic behavior of Whitwell He would not take anything just
at present he said and got his long length up from the root of a tree
where he had folded it down I dont seem to care much for anything in
the middle of the day breakfasts my best meal and he followed Jeff
off into the woods

Really said the lady what did they expect But the question was so
difficult that no one seemed able to make the simple answer

The incident darkened the day and spoiled its pleasure it cast a
lessening shadow into the evening when the guests met round the fire in
the large ugly new parlor at the hotel

The next morning the ladies assembled again on the piazza to decide what
should be done with the beautiful day before them Whitwell stood at the
foot of the flagstaff with one hand staying his person against it like
a figure posed in a photograph to verify proportions in the different
features of a prospect

The heroine of the unhappy affair of the picnic could not forbear
authorizing herself to invoke his opinion at a certain point of the
debate and Mr Whitwell she called to him wont you please come
here a moment

Whitwell slowly pulled himself across the grass to the group and at the
same moment as if she had been waiting for him to be present Mrs
Durgin came out of the office door and advanced toward the ladies

Mrs Marven she said with the stony passivity which the ladies used
to note in her when they came over to Lions Head Farm in the tallyhos
the stage leaves here at two oclock to get the down train at three I
want you should have your trunks ready to go on the wagon a little before
two

You want I should have myWhat do you mean Mrs Durgin

I want your rooms

You want my rooms

Mrs Durgin did not answer She let her steadfast look suffice and Mrs
Marven went on in a rising flutter Why you cant have my rooms I
dont understand you Ive taken my rooms for the whole of August and
they are mine and

I have got to have your rooms said Mrs Durgin

Very well then I wont give them up said the lady A bargains a
bargain and I have your agreement

If youre not out of your rooms by two oclock your things will be put
out and after dinner today you will not eat another bite under my
roof

Mrs Durgin went in and it remained for the company to make what they
could of the affair Mrs Marven did not wait for the result She was not
a dignified person but she rose with hauteur and whipped away to her
rooms hers no longer to make her preparations She knew at least how to
give her going the effect of quitting the place with disdain and
abhorrence

The incident of her expulsion was brutal but it was clearly meant to be
so It made Westover a little sick and he would have liked to pity Mrs
Marven more than he could The ladies said that Mrs Durgins behavior
was an outrage and they ought all to resent it by going straight to
their own rooms and packing their things and leaving on the same stage
with Mrs Marven None of them did so and their talk veered around to
something extenuating if not justifying Mrs Durgins action

I suppose one of them said that she felt more indignant about it
because she has been so very good to Mrs Marven and her daughter too
They were both sick on her hands here for a week after they came first
one and then the other and she looked after them and did for them like a
mother

And yet another lady suggested what could Mrs Marven have done
What did she do He wasnt asked to the picnic and I dont see why he
should have been treated as a guest He was there purely and simply to
bring the things and take them away And besides if there is anything
in distinctions in differences if we are to choose who is to associate
with usor our daughters

That is true the ladies said in one form or another with the tone of
conviction but they were not so deeply convinced that they did not want
a mans opinion and they all looked at Westover

He would not respond to their look and the lady who had argued for Mrs
Marven had to ask What do you think Mr Westover

Ah its a difficult question he said I suppose that as long as one
person believes himself or herself socially better than another it must
always be a fresh problem what to do in every given case

The ladies said they supposed so and they were forced to make what they
could of wisdom in which they might certainly have felt a want of
finality

Westover went away from them in a perplexed mind which was not simplified
by the contempt he had at the bottom of all for something unmanly in
Jeff who had carried his grievance to his mother like a slighted boy
and provoked her to take up arms for him

The sympathy for Mrs Marven mounted again when it was seen that she did
not come to dinner or permit her daughter to do so and when it became
known later that she had refused for both the dishes sent to their rooms
Her farewells to the other ladies when they gathered to see her off on
the stage were airy rather than cheery there was almost a demonstration
in her behalf but Westover was oppressed by a kind of inherent squalor
in the incident

At night he responded to a knock which he supposed that of Frank Whitwell
with icewater and Mrs Durgin came into his room and sat down in one of
his two chairs Mr Westover she said if you knew all I had done for
that woman and her daughter and how much she had pretended to think of
us all I dont believe youd be so ready to judge me

Judge you cried Westover Bless my soul Mrs Durgin I havent said
a word that could be tormented into the slightest censure

But you think I done wrong

I have not been at all able to satisfy myself on that point Mrs
Durgin I think its always wrong to revenge ones self

Yes I suppose it is said Mrs Durgin humbly and the tears came into
her eyes I got the tray ready with my own hands that was sent to her
room but she wouldnt touch it I presume she didnt like having a plate
prepared for her But I did feel sorry for her She ant over and above
strong and Im afraid shell be sick there ant any restrant at our
depot

Westover fancied this a fit mood in Mrs Durgin for her further
instruction and he said And if youll excuse me Mrs Durgin I dont
think what you did was quite the way to keep a hotel

More tears flashed into Mrs Durgins eyes but they were tears of wrath
now I would a done it she said if I thought every single one of
em would a left the house the next minute for there ant one that
has the first word to say against me any other way It want that I
cared whether she thought my son was good enough to eat with her or not
I know what I think and thats enough for me He want invited to the
picnic and he ant one to put himself forward If she didnt want him
to stay all she had to do was to do nothin But to make him up a plate
before everybody and hand it to him to eat with the horses like a tramp
or a dog Mrs Durgin filled to the throat with her wrath and the sight
of her made Westover keenly unhappy

Yes yes he said it was a miserable business He could not help
adding If Jeff could have kept it to himselfbut perhaps that wasnt
possible

Mr Westover said Mrs Durgin sternly Do you think Jeff would come
to me like a great crybaby and complain of my lady boarders and the way
they used him It was Mr Whitell that let it out or I dont know as I
should ever known about it

Im glad Jeff didnt tell you said Westover with a revulsion of good
feeling toward him

Hed a died first said his mother But Mr Whitell done just right
all through and I shant soon forget it Jeffs give me a proper goin
over for what I done both the boys have But I couldnt help it and I
should do just so again All is I wanted you should know just what you
was blamin me for

I dont know that I blame you I only wish you could have helped
itmanaged some other way

I did try to get over it and all I done was to lose a nights rest
Then this morning when I see her settin there so cool and mighty with
the boarders and takin the lead as usual I just waited till she got
Whitell across and nearly everybody was there that saw what she done to
Jeff and then I flew out on her

Westover could not suppress a laugh Well Mrs Durgin your retaliation
was complete it was dramatic

I dont know what you mean by that said Mrs Durgin rising and
resuming her selfcontrol she did not refuse herself a grim smile But
I guess she thought it was pretty perfect herselfor she will when
shes able to give her mind to it Im sorry for her daughter I never
had anything against her or her mother either for that matter before
Franky look after you pretty well Ill send him up with your icewater
Got everything else you want

I should have to invent a want if I wished to complain said Westover

Well I should like to have you do it We cant ever do too much for
you Well goodnight Mr Westover

Goodnight Mrs Durgin




XIII

Jeff Durgin entered Harvard that fall with fewer conditions than most
students have to work off This was set down to the credit of Lovewell
Academy where he had prepared for the university and some observers in
such matters were interested to note how thoroughly the old school in a
remote town had done its work for him

None who formed personal relations with him at that time conjectured that
he had done much of the work for himself and even to Westover when Jeff
came to him some weeks after his settlement in Cambridge he seemed
painfully out of his element and unamiably aware of it For the time at
least he had lost the jovial humor not too kindly always which largely
characterized him and expressed itself in sallies of irony which were
not so unkindly either The painter perceived that he was on his guard
against his own friendly interest Jeff made haste to explain that he
came because he had told his mother that he would do so He scarcely
invited a return of his visit and he left Westover wondering at the sort
of vague rebellion against his new life which he seemed to be in The
painter went out to see him in Cambridge not long after and was rather
glad to find him rooming with some other rustic Freshman in a humble
street running from the square toward the river for he thought Jeff must
have taken his lodging for its cheapness out of regard to his mothers
means But Jeff was not glad to be found there apparently he said at
once that he expected to get a room in the Yard the next year and eat at
Memorial Hall He spoke scornfully of his boardinghouse as a place where
they were all a lot of jays together and Westover thought him still more
at odds with his environment than he had before But Jeff consented to
come in and dine with him at his restaurant and afterward go to the
theatre with him

When he came Westover did not quite like his despatch of the halfbottle
of California claret served each of them with the Italian table dhote
He did not like his having already seen the play he proposed and he
found some difficulty in choosing a play which Jeff had not seen It
appeared then that he had been at the theatre two or three times a week
for the last month and that it was almost as great a passion with him as
with Westover himself He had become already a critic of acting with a
rough good sense of it and a decided opinion He knew which actors he
preferred and which actresses better still It was some consolation for
Westover to find that he mostly took an admission ticket when he went to
the theatre but though he could not blame Jeff for showing his own
fondness for it he wished that he had not his fondness

So far Jeff seemed to have spent very few of his evenings in Cambridge
and Westover thought it would be well if he had some acquaintance there
He made favor for him with a friendly family who asked him to dinner
They did it to oblige Westover against their own judgment and knowledge
for they said it was always the same with Freshmen a single act of
hospitality finished the acquaintance Jeff came and he behaved with as
great indifference to the kindness meant him as if he were dining out
every night he excused himself very early in the evening on the ground
that he had to go into Boston and he never paid his dinnercall After
that Westover tried to consider his whole duty to him fulfilled and not
to trouble himself further Now and then however Jeff disappointed the
expectation Westover had formed of him by coming to see him and being
apparently glad of the privilege But he did not make the painter think
that he was growing in grace or wisdom though he apparently felt an
increasing confidence in his own knowledge of life

Westover could only feel a painful interest tinged with amusement in his
grotesque misconceptions of the world where he had not yet begun to right
himself Jeff believed lurid things of the society wholly unknown to him
to his gross credulity Boston houses which at the worst were the homes
of a stiff and cold exclusiveness were the scenes of riot only less
scandalous than the dissipation to which fashionable ladies abandoned
themselves at champagne suppers in the Back Bay hotels and on their
secret visits to the Chinese opiumjoints in Kingston Street

Westover tried to make him see how impossible his fallacies were but he
could perceive that Jeff thought him either wilfully ignorant or
helplessly innocent and of far less authority than a barber who had the
entree of all these swell families as hairdresser and who corroborated
the witness of a hotel nightclerk Jeff would not give their names to
the depravity of the upper classes He had to content himself with
saying I hope you will be ashamed some day of having believed such rot
But I suppose its something youve got to go through You may take my
word for it though that it isnt going to do you any good Its going
to do you harm and thats why I hate to have you think it for your own
sake It cant hurt any one else

What disgusted the painter most was that with all his belief in the
wickedness of the fine world it was clear that Jeff would have willingly
been of it and he divined that if he had any strong aspirations they
were for society and for social acceptance He had fancied when the
fellow seemed to care so little for the studies of the university that
he might come forward in its sports Jeff gave more and more the effect
of tremendous strength in his peculiar physique though there was always
the disappointment of not finding him tall He was of the middle height
but he was hewn out and squared upward massively He felt like stone to
any accidental contact and the painter brought away a bruise from the
mere brunt of his shoulders He learned that Jeff was a frequenter of the
gymnasium where his strength must have been known but he could not make
out that he had any standing among the men who went in for athletics If
Jeff had even this the sort of standing in college which he failed of
would easily have been won too But he had been falsely placed at the
start or some quality of his nature neutralized other qualities that
would have made him a leader in college and he remained one of the least
forward men in it Other jays won favor and liking and ceased to be
jays Jeff continued a jay He was not chosen into any of the nicer
societies those that he joined when he thought they were swell he could
not care for when he found they were not

Westover came into a knowledge of the facts through his casual and
scarcely voluntary confidences and he pitied him somewhat while he
blamed him a great deal more without being able to help him at all

It appeared to him that the fellow had gone wrong more through ignorance
than perversity and that it was a stubbornness of spirit rather than a
badness of heart that kept him from going right He sometimes wondered
whether it was not more a baffled wish to be justified in his own esteem
than anything else that made him overvalue the things he missed He knew
how such an experience as that with Mrs Marven rankles in the heart of
youth and will not cease to smart till some triumph in kind brines it
ease but between the man of thirty and the boy of twenty there is a gulf
fixed and he could not ask He did not know that a college man often
goes wrong in his first year out of no impulse that he can very clearly
account for himself and then when he ceases to be merely of his type and
becomes more of his character he pulls up and goes right He did not
know how much Jeff had been with a set that was fast without being fine
The boy had now and then a book in his hand when he came not always such
a book as Westover could have wished but still a book and to his
occasional questions about how he was getting on with his college work
Jeff made brief answers which gave the notion that he was not neglecting
it

Toward the end of his first year he sent to Westover one night from a
stationhouse where he had been locked up for breaking a streetlamp in
Boston By his own showing he had not broken the lamp or assisted
except through his presence at the misdeed of the tipsy students who had
done it His breath betrayed that he had been drinking too but
otherwise he seemed as sober as Westover himself who did not know
whether to augur well or ill for him from the proofs he had given before
of his ability to carry off a bottle of wine with a perfectly level head
Jeff seemed to believe Westover a person of such influence that he could
secure his release at once and he was abashed to find that he must pass
the night in the cell where he conferred with Westover through the bars

In the police court where his companions were fined the next morning
he was discharged for want of evidence against him but the university
authorities did not take the same view as the civil authorities He was
suspended and for the time he passed out of Westovers sight and
knowledge

He expected to find him at Lions Head where he went to pass the month
of Augustin painting those pictures of the mountain which had in some
sort almost in spite of him become his specialty But Mrs Durgin
employed the first free moments after their meeting in explaining that
Jeff had got a chance to work his way to London on a cattlesteamer and
had been abroad the whole summer He had written home that the voyage had
been glorious with plenty to eat and little to do and he had made favor
with the captain for his return by the same vessel in September By other
letters it seemed that he had spent the time mostly in England but he
had crossed over into France for a fortnight and had spent a week in
Paris His mother read some passages from his letters aloud to show
Westover how Jeff was keeping his eyes open His accounts of his travel
were a mixture of crude sensations in the presence of famous scenes and
objects of interest hardheaded observation of the facts of life
narrowminded misconception of conditions and wholly intelligent and
adequate study of the art of innkeeping in city and country

Mrs Durgin seemed to feel that there was some excuse due for the
relative quantity of the last He knows thats what Id care for the
most and Jeff ant one to forget his mother As if the word reminded
her she added after a moment We shant any of us soon forget what
you done for Jeffthat time

I didnt do anything for him Mrs Durgin I couldnt Westover
protested

You done what you could and I know that you saw the thing in the right
light or you wouldnt a tried to do anything Jeff told me every word
about it I know he was with a pretty harumscarum crowd But it was a
lesson to him and I want goin to have him come back here right away
and have folks talkin about what they couldnt understand after the way
the paper had it

Did it get into the papers

Mm Mrs Durgin nodded And some dirty sneakin thing here wrote a
letter to the paper and told a passel o lies about Jeff and all of us
and the paper printed Jeffs picture with it I dont know how they got a
hold of it So when he got that chance to go I just said Go Youll
see hell keep all straight enough after this Mr Westover

Old woman read you any of Jeffs letters Whitwell asked when his
chance for private conference with Westover came What was the rights of
that scrape he got into

Westover explained as favorably to Jeff as he could the worst of the
affair was the bad company he was in

Well where theres smoke theres some fire Cout discharged him and
college suspended him Thats about where it is I guess hell keep out
o harms way next time Read you what he said about them scenes of the
Revolution in Paris

Yes he seems to have looked it all up pretty thoroughly

Done it for me I guess much as anything I was always talkin it up
with him Jeffs kep his eyes open thats a fact Hes got a head on
him moren I ever thought

Westover decided that Mrs Durgins prepotent behavior toward Mrs Marven
the summer before had not hurt her materially with the witnesses even
There were many new boarders but most of those whom he had already met
were again at Lions Head They said there was no air like it and no
place so comfortable If they had sold their birthright for a mess of
pottage Westover had to confess that the pottage was very good Instead
of the Irish woman at ten dollars a week who had hitherto been Mrs
Durgins cook under her personal surveillance and direction she had now
a man cook whom she boldly called a chef and paid eighty dollars a
month He wore the white apron and white cap of his calling but Westover
heard him speak Yankee through his nose to one of the stablemen as they
exchanged hilarities across the space between the basement and the
barndoor Yes Mrs Durgin admitted hes an American and he learnt
his trade at one of the best hotels in Portland Hes pretty headstrong
but I guess he does what hes toldin the end The meanyous Oh Franky
Whitwell prints then Hes got an amateur printingoffice in the
stableloft




XIV

One morning toward the end of August Whitwell who was starting
homeward after leaving his ladies burdened with their wishes and
charges for the morrow met Westover coming up the hill with his
paintinggear in his hand Say he hailed him Why dont you come down
to the house tonight Jacksons goin to come and if you hant seen
him work the plantchette for a spell youll be surprised There ant
hardly anybody he cant have up Youll come Good enough

What affected Westover first of all at the seance and perhaps most of
all was the quality of the air in the little house it was close and
stuffy mixed with an odor of mould and an ancient smell of rats The
kerosenelamp set in the centre of the table where Jackson afterward
placed his planchette devoured the little life that was left in it At
the gasps which Westover gave with some despairing glances at the closed
windows Whitwell said Hot Well I guess it is a little But you see
Jackson has got to be careful about the night air but I guess I can fix
it for you He went out into the ell and Westover heard him raising a
window He came back and asked That do It ll get around in here
directly and Westover had to profess relief

Jackson came in presently with the little Canuck whom Whitwell presented
to Westover Know Jombateeste

The two were talking about a landslide which had taken place on the other
side of the mountain the news had just come that they had found among
the ruins the body of the farmhand who had been missing since the
morning of the slide his funeral was to be the next day

Jackson put his planchette on the table and sat down before it with a
sigh the Canuck remained standing and on foot he was scarcely a head
higher than the seated Yankees Well Jackson said I suppose he knows
all about it now meaning the dead farmhand

Yes Westover suggested if he knows anything

Know anything Whitwell shouted Why man dont you believe hes as
much alive as ever he was

I hope so said Westover submissively

Dont you know it

Not as I know other things In fact I dont know it said Westover
and he was painfully aware of having shocked his hearers by the
agnosticism so common among men in towns that he had confessed it quite
simply and unconsciously He perceived that faith in the soul and life
everlasting was as quick as ever in the hills whatever grotesque or
unwonted form it wore Jackson sat with closed eyes and his head fallen
back Whitwell stared at the painter with open mouth the little Canuck
began to walk up and down impatiently Westover felt a reproach almost
an abhorrence in all of them

Whitwell asked Why dont you think theres any proof of it

Proof Oh Yes Theres testimony enough to carry conviction to the
stubbornest mind on any other point But its very strange about all
that It doesnt convince anybody but the witnesses If a man tells me
hes seen a disembodied spirit I cant believe him I must see the
disembodied spirit myself

Thats something so said Whitwell with a relenting laugh

If one came back from the dead to tell us of a life beyond the grave
we should want the assurance that hed really been dead and not merely
dreaming

Whitwell laughed again in the delight the philosophic mind finds even in
the reasoning that hates it

The Canuck felt perhaps the simpler joy that the average man has in any
strange notion that he is able to grasp He stopped in his walk and said
Yes and if you was dead and went to heaven and stayed so long you
smelt like Lazarus and you come back and tol em what you saw nobody
goin believe you

Well I guess youre right there Jombateeste said Whitwell with
pleasure in the Canucks point After a moment he suggested to Westover
Then I spose if you feel the way you do you dont care much about
plantchette

Oh yes I do said the painter We never know when we may be upon the
point of revelation I wouldnt miss any chance

Whether Whitwell felt an ironic slant in the words or not he paused a
moment before he said Want to start her up Jackson

Jackson brought to the floor the forefeet of his chair which he had
tilted from it in leaning back and without other answer put his hand on
the planchette It began to fly over the large sheet of paper spread upon
the table in curves and angles and eccentrics

Feels pootty lively tonight said Whitwell with a glance at Westover

The little Canuck as if he had now no further concern in the matter sat
down in a corner and smoked silently Whitwell asked after a moments
impatience

Cant you git her down to business Jackson

Jackson gasped Shell come down when she wants to

The little instrument seemed in fact trying to control itself Its
movements became less wild and large the zigzags began to shape
themselves into something like characters Jacksons wasted face gave no
token of interest Whitwell laid half his gaunt length across the table
in the endeavor to make out some meaning in them the Canuck with his
hands crossed on his stomach smoked on with the same gleam in his pipe
and eye

The planchette suddenly stood motionless

She done murmured Whitwell

I guess she is for a spell anyway said Jackson wearily

Lets try to make out what she says Whitwell drew the sheets toward
himself and Westover who sat next him Youve got to look for the
letters everywhere Sometimes shell give you fair and square writin
and then again shell slat the letters down every which way and youve
got to hunt em out for yourself Heres a B Ive got That begins along
pretty early in the alphabet Lets see what we can find next

Westover fancied he could make out an F and a T

Whitwell exulted in an unmistakable K and N and he made sure of an I
and an E The painter was not so sure of an S Well call it an S said
Whitwell And I guess Ive got an O here and an H Hello Heres an A
as large as life Pootty much of a mixture

Yes I dont see that were much better off than we were before said
Westover

Well I dont know about that said Whitwell

Write em down in a row and see if we cant pick out some sense Ive
had worse finds than this no vowels at all sometimes but heres three

He wrote the letters down while Jackson leaned back against the wall in
patient quiet

Well sir said Whitwell pushing the paper where he had written the
letters in a line to Westover make anything out of em

Westover struggled with them a moment I can make out one wordshaft

Anything else demanded Whitwell with a glance of triumph at Jackson

Westover studied the remaining letters Yes I get one other
wordbroken

Just what I done But I wanted you to speak first Its Broken Shaft
Jackson she caught right onto what we was talkin about This life he
turned to Westover in solemn exegesis is a broken shaft when death
comes It rests upon the earth but you got to look for the top of it in
the skies Thats the way I look at it What do you think Jackson
Jombateeste

I think anybody cant see that Better go and get some heyeglass

Westover remained in a shameful minority He said meekly It suggests a
beautiful hope

Jackson brought his chairlegs down again and put his hand on the
planchette

Feel that tinglin asked Whitwell and Jackson made yes with silent
lips After hes been workin the plantchette for a spell and then
leaves off and she wants to say something more Whitwell explained to
Westover he seems to feel a kind of tinglin in his arm as if it was
asleep and then hes got to tackle her again Writin steady enough now
Jackson he cried joyously Lets see He leaned over and read
Thomas Jefferson The planchette stopped My I didnt go to do
that said Whitwell apologetically You much acquainted with
Jeffersons writins he asked of Westover

The painter had to own his ignorance of all except the diction that the
government is best which governs least but he was not in a position to
deny that Jefferson had ever said anything about a broken shaft

It may have come to him on the other side said Whitwell

Perhaps Westover assented

The planchette began to stir itself again Shes goin ahead cried
Whitwell He leaned over the table so as to get every letter as it was
formed DYes Death Death is the Broken Shaft Go on After a moment
of faltering the planchette formed another letter It was a U and it was
followed by an R and so on till Durgin had been spelled Thunder
cried Whitwell If anythings happened to Jeff

Jackson lifted his hand from the planchette

Oh go on Jackson Whitwell entreated Dont leave it so

I cant seem to go on Jackson whispered and Westover could not resist
the fear that suddenly rose among them But he made the first struggle
against it This is nonsense Or if theres any sense in it it means
that Jeffs ship has broken her shaft and put back

Whitwell gave a loud laugh of relief Thats so Youve hit it Mr
Westover

Jackson said quietly He didnt mean to start home till tomorrow And
how could he send any message unless he was

Easily cried Westover Its simply an instance of mental
impressionof telepathy as they call it

Thats so shouted Whitwell with eager and instant conviction

Westover could see that Jackson still doubted If you believe that a
disembodied spirit can communicate with you why not an embodied spirit
If anything has happened to your brothers ship his mind would be
strongly on you at home and why couldnt it convey its thought to you

Because he hant started yet said Jackson

Westover wanted to laugh but they all heard voices without which seemed
to be coming nearer and he listened with the rest He made out Frank
Whitwells voice and his sisters and then another voice louder and
gayer rose boisterously above them Whitwell flung the door open and
plunged out into the night He came back hauling Jeff Durgin in by the
shoulder

Here now he shouted to Jackson you just let this feller and
plantchette fight it out together

Whats the matter with plantchette said Jeff before he said to his
brother Hello Jackson and to the Canuck Hello Jombateeste He
shook hands conventionally with them both and then with the painter
whom he greeted with greater interest Glad to see you here Mr
Westover Did I take you by surprise he asked of the company at large

No sir said Whitwell Didnt surprise us any if you are a fortnight
ahead of time he added with a wink at the others

Well I took a notion I wouldnt wait for the cattleship and I started
back on a French boat Thought Id try it They live well But I hoped I
should astonish you a little too I might as well waited

Whitwell laughed We heard from youplantchette kept right round after
you

That so asked Jeff carelessly

Fact Have a good voyage Whitwell had the air of putting a casual
question

Firstrate said Jeff Plantchette say not

No Only about the broken shaft

Broken shaft We didnt have any broken shaft Plantchettes got mixed a
little Got the wrong ship

After a moment of chopfallenness Whitwell said

Then somebodys been makin free with your name Curious how them devils
cut up oftentimes

He explained and Jeff laughed uproariously when he understood the whole
case Plantchettes been havin fun with you

Whitwell gave himself time for reflection No sir I dont look at it
that way I guess the wires got crossed some way If theres such a thing
as the spirits o the livin influencin plantchette accordin to Mr
Westovers say here I dont see why it want Jeffs being so near
that got control of her and made her sign his name to somebody elses
words It shows theres something in it

Well Im glad to come back alive anyway said Jeff with a joviality
new to Westover I tell you there ant many places finer than old
Lions Head after all Dont you think so Mr Westover I want to get
the daylight on it but it does well by moonlight even He looked round
at the tall girl who had been lingering to hear the talk of planchette
at the backward tilt he gave his head to get her in range she frowned
as if she felt his words a betrayal and slipped out of the room the boy
had already gone and was making himself heard in the low room overhead

Theres a lot of folks here this summer mother says he appealed from
the check he had got to Jackson Every room taken for the whole month
she says

Weve been pretty full all July too said Jackson blankly

Well its a great business and Ive picked up a lot of hints over
there Were not so smart as we think we are The Swiss can teach us a
thing or two They know how to keep a hotel

Go to Switzerland asked Whitwell

I slipped over into the edge of it

I want to know Well now them Alps nowthey so much bigger n the
White Hills after all

Well I dont know about all of em said Jeff There may be some that
would compare with our hills but I should say that you could take Mount
Washington up and set it in the lap of almost any one of the Alps I saw
and it would look like a baby on its mothers knee

I want to know said Whitwell again His tone expressed disappointment
but impartiality he would do justice to foreign superiority if he must
And about the ocean What about waves runnin mountains high

Well we didnt have it very rough But I dont believe I saw any waves
much higher than Lions Head Jeff laughed to find Whitwell taking him
seriously Wont that satisfy you

Oh it satisfies me Truth always does But now about London You
didnt seem to say so much about London in your letters now Is it so
big as they let on Bigthat is to the naked eye as you may say

There ant any one place where you can get a complete birdseye view
of it said Jeff and twothirds of it would be hid in smoke anyway
Youve got to think of a place that would take in the whole population of
New England outside of Massachusetts and not feel as if it had more
than a comfortable meal

Whitwell laughed for joy in the bold figure

Ill tell you When youve landed and crossed up from Liverpool and
struck London you feel as if youd gone to sea again Its an oceana
whole Atlantic of houses

Thats right crowed Whitwell Thats the way I thought it was
Growin any

Jeff hesitated It grows in the night Youve heard about Chicago
growing

Yes

Well London grows a whole Chicago every night

Good said Whitwell That suits me And about Paris now Paris strike
you the same way

It dont need to said Jeff Thats a place where Id like to live
Everybodys at home there Its a mans house and his front yard and I
tell you they keep it clean Paris is washed down every morning scrubbed
and mopped and rubbed dry You couldnt find any more dirt than you could
in mothers kitchen after shes hung out her wash That so Mr
Westover

Westover confirmed in general Jeffs report of the cleanliness of Paris

And beautiful You dont know what a goodlooking town is till you
strike Paris And theyre proud of it too Every man acts as if he owned
it Theyve had the statue of Alsace in that Place de la Concorde of
yours Mr Whitwell where they had the guillotine all draped in black
ever since the war with Germany and they mean to have her back some
day

Great country Jombateeste Whitwell shouted to the Canuck

The little man roused himself from the muse in which he was listening and
smoking Me Im Frantsh he said

Yes thats what Jeff was sayin said Whitwell I meant France

Oh answered Jombateeste impatiently I thought you mean the Hunited
State

Well not this time said Whitwell amid the general laughter

Good for Jombateeste said Jeff Stand up for Canada every time John
Its the livest country in the world three months of the year and the
ice keeps it perfectly sweet the other nine

Whitwell could not brook a diversion from the high and serious inquiry
they had entered upon It must have made this country look pretty slim
when you got back Howd New York look after Paris

Like a pigpen said Jeff He left his chair and walked round the table
toward a door opening into the adjoining room For the first time
Westover noticed a figure in white seated there and apparently rapt in
the talk which had been going on At the approach of Jeff and before he
could have made himself seen at the doorway a tremor seemed to pass over
the figure it fluttered to its feet and then it vanished into the
farther dark of the room When Jeff disappeared within there was a sound
of rustling skirts and skurrying feet and the crash of a closing door
and then the free rise of laughing voices without After a discreet
interval Westover said Mr Whitwell I must say goodnight Ive got
another days work before me Its been a most interesting evening

You must try it again said Whitwell hospitably We hant got to the
bottom of that broken shaft yet Youll see t plantchette ll have
something more to say about it Heigh Jackson He rose to receive
Westovers goodnight the others nodded to him

As the painter climbed the hill to the hotel he saw two figures on the
road below the one in white drapery looked severed by a dark line
slanting across it at the waist In the country he knew such an
appearance might mark the earliest stages of lovemaking or mere
youthful tenderness in which there was nothing more implied or expected
But whatever the fact was Westover felt a vague distaste for it which
as it related itself to a more serious possibility deepened to something
like pain It was probable that it should come to this between those two
but Westover rebelled against the event with a sense of its unfitness for
which he could not give himself any valid reason and in the end he
accused himself of being a fool

Two ladies sat on the veranda of the hotel and watched a cloudwreath
trying to lift itself from the summit of Lions Head In the effort it
thinned away to transparency in places in others it tore its frail
texture asunder and let parts of the mountain show through then the
fragments knitted themselves loosely together and the vapor lay again in
dreamy quiescence

The ladies were older and younger and apparently mother and daughter
The mother had kept her youth in face and figure so admirably that in
another light she would have looked scarcely the elder It was the candor
of the morning which confessed the fine vertical lines running up and
down to her lips only a shade paler than the girls and that showed her
hair a trifle thinner in its coppery brown her blue eyes a little
dimmer They were both very graceful and they had soft caressing
voices they now began to talk very politely to each other as if they
were strangers or as if strangers were by They talked of the landscape
and of the strange cloud effect before them They said that they supposed
they should see the Lions Head when the cloud lifted and they were both
sure they had never been quite so near a cloud before They agreed that
this was because in Switzerland the mountains were so much higher and
farther off Then the daughter said without changing the direction of
her eyes or the tone of her voice The gentleman who came over from the
station with us last night and the mother was aware of Jeff Durgin
advancing toward the corner of the veranda where they sat

I hope you have got rested he said with the jovial bluntness which
was characteristic of him with women

Oh yes indeed said the elder lady Jeff had spoken to her but had
looked chiefly at the younger I slept beautifully So quiet here and
with this delicious air Have you just tasted it

No Ive been up ever since daylight driving round said Jeff Im
glad you like the air he said after a certain hesitation We always
want to have people do that at Lions Head Theres no air like it
though perhaps I shouldnt say so

Shouldnt the lady repeated

Yes we own the air herethis part of it Jeff smiled easily down at
the ladys puzzled face

Oh Then you areare you a son of the house

Son of the hotel yes said Jeff with increasing ease The lady
continued her question in a look and he went on Ive been scouring the
country for butter and eggs this morning We shall get all our supplies
from Boston next year I hope but we depend on the neighbors a little
yet

How very interesting said the lady You must have a great many queer
adventures she suggested in a provisional tone

Well nothings queer to me in the hill country But you see some
characters here He nodded over his shoulder to where Whitwell stood by
the flagstaff waiting the morning impulse of the ladies Theres one
of the greatest of them now

The lady put up a lorgnette and inspected Whitwell What are those
strange things he has got in his hatband

The flowers and the fungi of the season said Jeff He takes parties
of the ladies walking and that collection is what he calls his almanac

Really cried the girl Thats charming

Delightful said the mother moved by the same impulse apparently

Yes said Jeff You ought to hear him talk Ill introduce him to you
after breakfast if you like

Oh we should only be too happy said the mother and her daughter
from her inflection knew that she would be willing to defer her
happiness

But Jeff did not Mr Whitwell he called out and Whitwell came
across the grass to the edge of the veranda I want to introduce you to
Mrs Vostrandand Miss Vostrand

Whitwell took their slim hands successively into his broad flat palm
and made Mrs Vostrand repeat her name to him Strangers at Lions Head
I presume Mrs Vostrand owned as much and he added Well I guess you
wont find a much sightlier place anywhere though accordin to Jeffs
say here theyve got bigger mountains on the other side Ever been in
Europe

Why yes said Mrs Vostrand with a little mouth of deprecation In
fact weve just come home Weve been living there

That so returned Whitwell in humorous toleration Glad to get back
I presume

Oh yesyes said Mrs Vostrand in a sort of willowy concession as if
the character before her were not to be crossed or gainsaid

Well it ll do you good here said Whitwell N the young lady too
A few tramps over these hills ll make you look like another woman He
added as if he had perhaps made his remarks too personal to the girl
Both of you

Oh yes the mother assented fervently We shall count upon your
showing us all theirmysteries

Whitwell looked pleased Ill do my bestwhenever youre ready He went
on Why Jeff here has just got back too Jeff what was the name of
that French boat you said you crossed on I want to see if I cant make
out what plantchette meant by that broken shaft She must have meant
something and if I could find out the name of the shipTell the ladies
about it Jeff laughed with a shake of the head and Whitwell
continued Why it was like this and he possessed the ladies of a fact
which they professed to find extremely interesting At the end of their
polite expressions he asked Jeff again What did you say the name was

Aquitaine said Jeff briefly

Why we came on the Aquitaine said Mrs Vostrand with a smile for
Jeff But how did we happen not to see one another

Oh I came secondcabin said Jeff I worked my way over on a
cattleship to London and when I decided not to work my way back I
found I hadnt enough money for a firstcabin passage I was in a hurry
to get back in time to get settled at Harvard and so I came
secondcabin It wasnt bad I used to see you across the rail

Well said Whitwell

How veryamusing said Mrs Vostrand What a small world it is With
these words she fell into a vagary her daughter recalled her from it
with a slight movement Breakfast How impatient you are Genevieve
Well She smiled the sweetest parting to Whitwell and suffered herself
to be led away by Jeff

And youre at Harvard Im so interested My own boy will be going there
soon

Well theres no place like Harvard said Jeff Im in my Sophomore
year now

Oh a Sophomore Fancy cried Mrs Vostrand as if nothing could give
her more pleasure My son is going to prepare at St Marks Did you
prepare there

No I prepared at Lovewell Academy over here Jeff nodded in a
southerly direction

Oh indeed said Mrs Vostrand as if she knew where Lovewell was and
instantly recognized the name of the ancient school

They had reached the dining room and Jeff pushed the screendoor open
with one hand and followed the ladies in He had the effect of welcoming
them like invited guests he placed the ladies himself at a window where
he said Mrs Vostrand would be out of the draughts and they could have a
good view of Lions Head

He leaned over between them when they were seated to get sight of the
mountain and There he said That clouds gone at last Then as if
it would be modester in the proprietor of the view to leave them to their
flattering raptures in it he moved away and stood talking a moment with
Cynthia Whitwell near the door of the servingroom He talked gayly with
many tosses of the head and turns about while she listened with a vague
smile motionlessly

Shes very pretty said Miss Vostrand to her mother

Yes The New England type murmured the mother

They all have the same look a good deal said the girl glancing over
the room where the waitresses stood ranged against the wall with their
hands folded at their waists They have better faces than figures but
she is beautiful every way Do you suppose they are all schoolteachers
They look intellectual Or is it their glasses

I dont know said the mother They used to be but things change here
so rapidly it may all be different Do you like it

I think its charming here said the younger lady evasively
Everything is so exquisitely clean And the food is very good Is this
cornbreadthat youve told me about so much

Yes this is cornbread You will have to get accustomed to it

Perhaps it wont take long I could fancy that girl knowing about
everything Dont you like her looks

Oh very much Mrs Vostrand turned for another glance at Cynthia

What say Their smiling waitress came forward from the wall where she
was leaning as if she thought they had spoken to her

Oh we were speakingthe young lady to whom Mr Durgin was talkingshe
is

Shes the housekeeperMiss Whitwell

Oh indeed She seems so young

I guess she knows what to dooo the waitress chanted We think shes
about riight She smiled tolerantly upon the misgiving of the
stranger if it was that and then retreated when the mother and daughter
began talking together again

They had praised the mountain with the cloud off to Jeff very politely
and now the mother said a little more intimately but still with the
deference of a society acquaintance He seems very gentlemanly and I am
sure he is very kind I dont quite know what to do about it do you

No I dont Its all strange to me you know

Yes I suppose it must be But you will get used to it if we remain in
the country Do you think you will dislike it

Oh no Its very different

Yes its different He is very handsome in a certain way The
daughter said nothing and the mother added I wonder if he was trying
to conceal that he had come secondcabin and was not going to let us
know that he crossed with us

Do you think he was bound to do so

No But it was very odd his not mentioning it And his going out on a
cattlesteamer the mother observed

Oh but thats very chic Ive heard the daughter replied Ive heard
that the young men like it and think it a great chance They have great
fun It isnt at all like secondcabin

You young people have your own world the mother answered caressingly

Westover met the ladies coming out of the diningroom as he went in
rather late to breakfast he had been making a study of Lions Head in
the morning light after the cloud lifted from it He was always doing
Lions Heads it seemed to him but he loved the mountain and he was
always finding something new in it

He was now seeing it inwardly with so exclusive a vision that he had no
eyes for these extremely pretty women till they were out of sight Then
he remembered noticing them and started with a sense of recognition
which he verified by the hotel register when he had finished his meal It
was in fact Mrs James W Vostrand and it was Miss Vostrand whom
Westover had know ten years before in Italy Mrs Vostrand had then
lately come abroad for the education of her children and was pausing in
doubt at Florence whether she should educate them in Germany or
Switzerland Her husband had apparently abandoned this question to her
and he did not contribute his presence to her moral support during her
struggle with a problem which Westover remembered as having a tendency to
solution in the direction of a permanent stay in Florence

In those days he liked Mrs Vostrand very much and at twenty he
considered her at thirty distinctly middleaged For one winter she had a
friendly little salon which was the most attractive place in Florence to
him then a cub painter sufficiently unlicked He was aware of her
children being a good deal in the salon a girl of eight who was like
her mother and quite a savage little boy of five who may have been like
his father If he was and the absent Mr Vostrand had the same habit of
sulking and kicking at peoples shins Westover could partly understand
why Mrs Vostrand had come to Europe for the education of her children
It all came vividly back to him while he went about looking for Mrs
Vostrand and her daughter on the verandas and in the parlors But he did
not find them and he was going to send his name to their rooms when he
came upon Jeff Durgin figuring about the office in a fresh London
conception of an outing costume

Youre very swell said Westover halting him to take full note of it

Like it Well I knew youd understand what it meant Mother thinks its
a little too rowdylooking Her idea is black broadcloth frockcoat and
doeskin trousers for a gentleman you know He laughed with a young
joyousness and then became serious Couple of ladies here somewhere
Id like to introduce you to Came over with me from the depot last
night Very nice people and Id like to make it pleasant for themget
up somethinggo somewhereand when you see their style you can judge
what it had better be Mrs Vostrand and her daughter

Thank you said Westover I think I know them already at least one of
them I used to go to Mrs Vostrands house in Florence

That so Well fact is I crossed with them but I came secondcabin
because Id spent all my money and I didnt get acquainted with them on
the ship but we met in the train coming up last night Said they had
heard of Lions Head on the other side from friends But it was quite a
coincidence dont you think Id like to have them see what this
neighborhood really is and I wish Mr Westover youd find out if you
can what theyd like If theyre for walking we could get Whitwell to
personally conduct a party and if theyre for driving Id like to show
them a little mountaincoaching myself

I dont know whether Id better not leave the whole thing to you Jeff
Westover said after a moments reflection I dont see exactly how I
could bring the question into a first interview

Well perhaps it would be rather rushing it But if I get up something
youll come Mr Westover

I will with great pleasure said Westover and he went to make his
call

A halfhour later he was passing the door of the old parlor which Mrs
Durgin still kept for hers on his way up to his room when a sound of
angry voices came out to him Then the voice of Mrs Durgin defined
itself in the words Im not goin to have to ask any more folks for
their rooms on your account Jeff DurginMr Westover Mr Westover is
that you her voice broke off to call after him as he hurried by Wont
you come in here a minute

He hesitated and then Jeff called Yes come in Mr Westover

The painter found him sitting on the old haircloth sofa with his stick
between his hands and knees confronting his mother who was rocking
excitedly to and fro in the old haircloth easychair

You know these folks that Jeffs so crazy about she demanded

Crazy cried Jeff laughing and frowning at the same time Whats
crazy in wanting to go off on a drive and choose your own party

Do you know them Mrs Durgin repeated to Westover

The Vostrands Why yes I knew Mrs Vostrand in Italy a good many years
ago and Ive just been calling on her and her daughter who was a little
girl then

What kind of folks are they

What kind Really Why theyre very charming people

So Jeff seems to think Any call to show them any particular attention

I dont know if I quite understand

Why its just this Jeff here wants to make a picnic for them or
something and I cant see the sense of it You remember what happened at
that other picnic with that Mrs MarvenJeff tapped the floor with his
stick impatiently and Westover felt sorry for himand I dont want it
to happen again and Ive told Jeff so I presume he thinks it ll set
him right with them if theyre thinkin demeaning of him because he came
over secondcabin on their ship

Jeff set his teeth and compressed his lips to bear as best he could the
giveaway which his mother could not appreciate in its importance to him

Theyre not the kind of people to take such a thing shabbily said
Westover They didnt happen to mention it but Mrs Vostrand must have
got used to seeing young fellows in straits of all kinds during her life
abroad I know that I sometimes made the cup of tea and biscuit she used
to give me in Florence do duty for a dinner and I believe she knew it

Jeff looked up at Westover with a grateful sidelong glance

His mother said Well then thats all right and Jeff neednt do
anything for them on that account And Ive made up my mind about one
thing whatever the hotel does has got to be done for the whole hotel It
cant pick and choose amongst the guests Westover liked so little the
part of old family friend which he seemed whether he liked it or not to
bear with the Durgins that he would gladly have got away now but Mrs
Durgin detained him with a direct appeal Dont you think so Mr
Westover

Jeff spared him the pain of a response Very well he said to his
mother Im not the hotel and you never want me to be I can do this on
my own account

Not with my coach and not with my hosses said his mother

Jeff rose I might as well go on down to Cambridge and get to work on
my conditions

Just as you please about that said Mrs Durgin with the same
impassioned quiet that showed in her sons handsome face and made it one
angry red to his yellow hair Weve got along without you so far this
summer and I guess we can the rest of the time And the sooner you work
off your conditions the better I presume

The next morning Jeff came to take leave of him where Westover had
pitched his easel and campstool on the slope behind the hotel

Why are you really going he asked I was in hopes it might have
blown over

No things dont blow over so easy with mother said Jeff with an
embarrassed laugh but no resentment She generally means what she
says

Well in this case Jeff I think she was right

Oh I guess so said Jeff pulling up a long blade of grass and taking
it between his teeth Anyway it comes to the same thing as far as Im
concerned Its for her to say what shall be done and what shant be
done in her own house even if it is a hotel Thats what I shall do in
mine Were used to these little differences but we talk it out and
thats the end of it I shouldnt really go though if I didnt think I
ought to get in some work on those conditions before the thing begins
regularly I should have liked to help here a little for Ive had a good
time and I ought to be willing to pay for it But shes in good hands
Jacksons wellfor himand shes got Cynthia

The easy security of tone with which Jeff pronounced the name vexed
Westover I suppose your mother would hardly know how to do without her
even if you were at home he said dryly

Well thats a fact Jeff assented with a laugh for the hit And
Jackson thinks the world of her I believe he trusts her judgment more
than he does mothers about the hotel Well I must be going You dont
know where Mrs Vostrand is going to be this winter I suppose

No I dont said Westover He could not help a sort of blind
resentment in the situation If he could not feel that Jeff was the best
that could be for Cynthia he had certainly no reason to regret that his
thoughts could be so lightly turned from her But the fact anomalously
incensed him as a slight to the girl who might have been still more
sacrificed by Jeffs constancy He forced himself to add I fancy Mrs
Vostrand doesnt know herself

I wish I didnt know where I was going to be said Jeff Well
goodbye Mr Westover Ill see you in Boston

Oh goodbye The painter freed himself from his brush and palette for
a parting handshake reluctantly

Jeff plunged down the hill waving a final adieu from the corner of the
hotel before he vanished round it

Mrs Vostrand and her daughter were at breakfast when Westover came in
after the early light had been gone some time They entreated him to join
them at their table and the mother said I suppose you were up soon
enough to see young Mr Durgin off Isnt it too bad he has to go back to
college when its so pleasant in the country

Not bad for him said Westover Hes a young man who can stand a great
deal of hard work Partly because he was a little tired of Jeff and
partly because he was embarrassed in their presence by the reason of his
going he turned the talk upon the days they had known together

Mrs Vostrand was very willing to talk of her past even apart from his
and she told him of her sojourn in Europe since her daughter had left
school They spent their winters in Italy and their summers in
Switzerland where it seemed her son was still at his studies in
Lausanne She wished him to go to Harvard she said and she supposed he
would have to finish his preparation at one of the American schools but
she had left the choice entirely to Mr Vostrand

This seemed a strange event after twelve years stay in Europe for the
education of her children but Westover did not feel authorized to make
any comment upon it He fell rather to thinking how very pleasant both
mother and daughter were and to wondering how much wisdom they had
between them He reflected that men had very little wisdom as far as he
knew them and he questioned whether after all the main difference
between men and women might not be that women talked their follies and
men acted theirs Probably Mrs Vostrand with all her babble had done
fewer foolish things than her husband but here Westover felt his
judgment disabled by the fact that he had never met her husband and his
mind began to wander to a question of her daughter whom he had there
before him He found himself bent upon knowing more of the girl and
trying to eliminate her mother from the talk or at least to make
Genevieve lead in it But apparently she was not one of the natures that
like to lead at any rate she remained discreetly in abeyance and
Westover fancied she even respected her mothers opinions and ideas He
thought this very well for both of them whether it was the effect of
Mrs Vostrands merit or Miss Vostrands training They seemed both of
one exquisite gentleness and of one sweet manner which was rather
elaborate and formal in expression They deferred to each other as
politely as they deferred to him but if anything the daughter deferred
most




XVII

The Vostrands did not stay long at Lions Head Before the week was out
Mrs Vostrand had a letter summoning them to meet her husband at
Montreal where that mysterious man who never came into the range of
Westovers vision somehow was kept by business from joining them in the
mountains

Early in October the painter received Mrs Vostrands card at his studio
in Boston and learned from the scribble which covered it that she was
with her daughter at the Hotel Vendome He went at once to see them
there and was met almost before the greetings were past with a prayer
for his opinion

Favorable opinion he asked

Favorable Oh yes of course Its simply this When I sent you my card
we were merely birds of passage and now I dont know but we areWhat is
the opposite of birds of passage

Westover could not think and said so

Well it doesnt matter We were walking down the street here this
morning and we saw the sign of an apartment to let in a window and we
thought just for amusement we would go in and look at it

And you took it

No not quite so rapid as that But it was lovely in such a pretty
hotel garni and so exquisitely furnished We didnt really think of
staying in Boston wed quite made up our minds on New York but this
apartment is a temptation

Why not yield then said Westover Thats the easiest way with a
temptation Confess now that youve taken the apartment already

No no I havent yet said Mrs Vostrand

And if I advised not you wouldnt

Ah thats another thing

When are you going to take possession Mrs Vostrand

Oh at once I supposeif we do

And may I come in when Im hungry just as I used to do in Florence and
will you stay me with flagons in the old way

There never was anything but tea you know well enough

The tea had rum in it

Well perhaps it will have rum in it here if youre very good

I will try my best on condition that youll make any and every possible
use of me Mrs Vostrand I cant tell you how very glad I am youre
going to stay said the painter with a fervor that made her impulsively
put out her hand to him He kept it while he could add I dont
forgetI can never forgethow good you were to me in those days and
at that she gave his hand a quick pressure If I can do anything at all
for you you will let me wont you Im afraid youll be so well
provided for that there wont be anything Ask them to slight you to
misuse you in something so that I can come to your rescue

Yes I will Mrs Vostrand promised And may we come to your studio to
implore your protection

The sooner the better Westover got himself away with a very sweet
friendship in his heart for this rather anomalous lady who more than
half her daughters life had lived away from her daughters father upon
apparently perfectly good terms with him and so discreetly and
selfrespectfully that no breath of reproach had touched her Until now
however her position had not really concerned Westover and it would not
have concerned him now if it had not been for a design that formed
itself in his mind as soon as he knew that Mrs Vostrand meant to pass
the winter in Boston He felt at once that he could not do things by
halves for a woman who had once done them for him by wholes and something
over and he had instantly decided that he must not only be very pleasant
to her himself but he must get his friends to be pleasant too His
friends were some of the nicest people in Boston nice in both the
personal and the social sense he knew they would not hesitate to
sacrifice themselves for him in a good cause and that made him all the
more anxious that the cause should be good beyond question

Since his last return from Paris he had been rather a fad as a teacher
and his class had been kept quite strictly to the ladies who got it up
and to such as they chose to let enter it These were not all chosen for
wealth or family there were some whose gifts gave the class distinction
and the ladies were glad to have them It would be easy to explain Mrs
Vostrand to these but the others might be more difficult they might
have their anxieties and Westover meant to ask the leader of the class
to help him receive at the studio tea he had at once imagined for the
Vostrands and that would make her doubly responsible

He found himself drawing a very deep and long breath before he began to
mount the many stairs to his studio and wishing either that Mrs
Vostrand had not decided to spend the winter in Boston or else that he
were of a slacker conscience and could wear his gratitude more lightly
But there was some relief in thinking that he could do nothing for a
month yet He gained a degree of courage by telling the ladies when he
went to find them in their new apartment that he should want them to
meet a few of his friends at tea as soon as people began to get back to
town and he made the most of their instant joy in accepting his
invitation

His pleasure was somehow dashed a little before he left them by the
announcement of Jeff Durgins name

I felt bound to send him my card said Mrs Vostrand while Jeff was
following his up in the elevator He was so very kind to us the day we
arrived at Zions Head and I didnt know but he might be feeling a
little sensitive about coming over secondcabin in our ship and

How like you Mrs Vostrand cried Westover and he was now distinctly
glad he had not tried to sneak out of doing something for her Your
kindness wont be worse wasted on Durgin than it was on me in the old
days when I supposed I had taken a secondcabin passage for the voyage
of life Theres a great deal of good in him I dont mean to say he got
through his Freshman year without trouble with the college authorities
but the Sophomore year generally brings wisdom

Oh said Mrs Vostrand theyre always a little wild at first I
suppose

Later the ladies brought Jeff with them when they came to Westovers
studio and the painter perceived that they were very good friends as if
they must have met several times since he had seen them together He
interested himself in the growing correctness of Jeffs personal effect
During his Freshman year while the rigor of the unwritten Harvard law
yet forbade him a silk hat or a cane he had kept something of the boy
if not the country boy Westover had noted that he had always rather a
taste for clothes but in this first year he did not get beyond a
derbyhat and a sackcoat varied toward the end by a cutaway In the
outing dress he wore at home he was always effective but there was
something in Jeffs figure which did not lend itself to more formal
fashion something of herculean proportion which would have marked him of
a classic beauty perhaps if he had not been in clothes at all or of a
yeomanly vigor and force if he had been clad for work but which seemed
to threaten the more worldly conceptions of the tailor with danger It
was as if he were about to burst out of his clothes not because he wore
them tight but because there was somehow more of the man than the
citizen in him something native primitive something that Westover
could not find quite a word for characterized him physically and
spiritually When he came into the studio after these delicate ladies
the robust Jeff Durgin wore a long frockcoat with a flower in his
buttonhole and in his left hand he carried a silk hat turned over his
forearm as he must have noticed people whom he thought stylish carrying
their hats He had on darkgray trousers and sharppointed
enamelledleather shoes and Westover grotesquely reflected that he was
dressed as he stood to lead Genevieve Vostrand to the altar

Westover saw at once that when he made his studio tea for the Vostrands
he must ask Jeff it would be cruel and for several reasons impossible
not to do so and he really did not see why he should not Mrs Vostrand
was taking him on the right ground as a Harvard student and nobody need
take him on any other Possibly people would ask him to teas at their own
houses from Westovers studio but he could not feel that he was
concerned in that Society is interested in a mans future not his past
as it is interested in a womans past not her future

But when he gave his tea it went off wonderfully well in every way
perhaps because it was one of the first teas of the fall It brought
people together in their autumnal freshness before the winter had begun
to wither their resolutions to be amiable to one another to dull their
wits to stale their stories or to give so wide a currency to their
sayings that they could not freely risk them with every one

Westover had thought it best to be frank with the leading lady of his
class when she said she should be delighted to receive for him and
would provide suitable young ladies to pour a brunette for the tea and
a blonde for the chocolate She took his scrupulosity very lightly when
he spoke of Mrs Vostrands educational sojourn in Europe she laughed
and said she knew the type and the situation was one of the most obvious
phases of the American marriage

He protested in vain that Mrs Vostrand was not the type she laughed
again and said Oh types were never typical But she was hospitably
gracious both to her and to Miss Genevieve she would not allow that the
mother was not the type when Westover challenged her experience but she
said they were charming and made haste to get rid of the question with
the vivid demand But who was your young friend who ought to have worn a
lionskin and carried a club

Westover by this time disdained palliation He said that Jeff was the son
of the landlady at Lions Head Mountain which he had painted so much
and he was now in his second year at Harvard where he was going to make
a lawyer of himself and this interested the lady She asked if he had
talent and a number of other things about him and about his mother and
Westover permitted himself to be rather graphic in telling of his
acquaintance with Mrs Durgin




XVIII

After all it was rather a simplehearted thing of Westover to have
either hoped or feared very much for the Vostrands Society in the sense
of good society can always take care of itself and does so perfectly
In the case of Mrs Vostrand some ladies who liked Westover and wished to
be civil to him asked her and her daughter to other afternoon teas shook
hands with them at their coming and said when they went they were
sorry they must be going so soon In the crowds people recognized them
now and then both of those who had met them at Westovers studio and of
those who had met them at Florence and Lausanne But if these were merely
people of fashion they were readily rid of the Vostrands whom the
dullest among them quickly perceived not to be of their own sort
somehow Many of the ladies of Westovers class made Genevieve promise to
let them paint her and her beauty and her grace availed for several
large dances at the houses of more daring spirits where the daughters
made a duty of getting partners for her and discharged it
conscientiously But there never was an approach to more intimate
hospitalities and toward the end of February when good society in
Boston goes southward to indulge a Lenten grief at Old Point Comfort
Genevieve had so many vacant afternoons and evenings at her disposal that
she could not have truthfully pleaded a previous engagement to the
invitations Jeff Durgin made her They were chiefly for the theatre and
Westover saw him with her and her mother at different plays he wondered
how Jeff had caught on to the notion of asking Mrs Vostrand to come with
them

Jeffs introductions at Westovers tea had not been many and they had
not availed him at all He had been asked to no Boston houses and when
other students whom he knew were going in to dances the whole winter
he was socially as quiet but for the Vostrands as at the Midyear
Examinations Westover could not resent the neglect of society in his
case and he could not find that he quite regretted it but he thought it
characteristically nice of Mrs Vostrand to make as much of the
friendless fellow as she fitly could He had no doubt but her tact would
be equal to his management in every way and that she could easily see to
it that he did not become embarrassing to her daughter or herself

One day after the east wind had ceased to blow the breath of the
icefields of Labrador against the New England coast and the buds on the
trees along the mall between the lawns of the avenue were venturing forth
in a hardy experiment of the Boston May Mrs Vostrand asked Westover if
she had told him that Mr Vostrand was actually coming on to Boston He
rejoiced with her in this prospect and he reciprocated the wish which
she said Mr Vostrand had always had for a meeting with himself

A fortnight later when the leaves had so far inured themselves to the
weather as to have fully expanded she announced another letter from Mr
Vostrand saying that after all he should not be able to come to
Boston but hoped to be in New York before she sailed

Sailed cried Westover

Why yes Didnt you know we were going to sail in June I thought I had
told you

No

Why yes We must go out to poor Checco now Mr Vostrand insists upon
that If ever we are a united family again Mr Westoverif Mr Vostrand
can arrange his business when Checco is ready to enter HarvardI mean
to take a house in Boston Im sure I should be contented to live nowhere
else in America The place has quite bewitched medear old sober
charming Boston Im sure I should like to live here all the rest of my
life But why in the world do people go out of town so early Those
houses over there have been shut for a whole month past

They were sitting at Mrs Vostrands window looking out on the avenue
where the pale globular electrics were swimming like jellyfish in the
clear evening air and above the ranks of low trees the houses on the
other side were closeshuttered from basement to attic

Westover answered Some go because they have such pleasant houses at the
shore and some because they want to dodge their taxes

To dodge their taxes she repeated and he had to explain how if people
were in their countryhouses before the 1st of May they would not have to
pay the high personal tax of the city and she said that she would write
that to Mr Vostrand it would be another point in favor of Boston
Women she declared would never have thought of such a thing she
denounced them as culpably ignorant of so many matters that concerned
them especially legal matters And you think she asked that Mr
Durgin will be a good lawyer That he willdistinguish himself

Westover thought it rather a shortcut to Jeff from the things they had
been talking of but if she wished to speak of him he had no reason to
oppose her wish Ive heard its all changed a good deal There are
still distinguished lawyers and lawyers who get on but they dont
distinguish themselves in the old way so much and they get on best by
becoming counsel for some powerful corporation

And you think he has talent she pursued For that I mean

Oh I dont know said Westover I think he has a good head He can do
what he likes within certain limits and the limits are not all on the
side I used to fancy He baffles me But of late I fancy youve seen
rather more of him than I have

I have urged him to go more to you But said Mrs Vostrand with a
burst of frankness he thinks you dont like him

Hes wrong said Westover But I might dislike him very much

I see what you mean said Mrs Vostrand and Im glad youve been so
frank with me Ive been so interested in Mr Durgin so interested
Isnt he very young

The question seemed a bit of indirection to Westover But he answered
directly enough Hes rather old for a Sophomore I believe Hes
twentytwo

And Genevieve is twenty Mr Westover may I trust you with something

With everything I hope Mrs Vostrand

Its about Genevieve Her father is so opposed to her making a foreign
marriage It seems to be his one great dread And of course shes very
much exposed to it living abroad so much with me and I feel doubly
bound on that account to respect her fathers opinions or even
prejudices Before we left Florencein fact last winterthere was a
most delightful young officer wished to marry her I dont know that she
cared anything for him though he was everything that I could have
wished handsome brilliant accomplished good family everything but
rich and that was what Mr Vostrand objected to or rather he objected
to putting up as he called it the sum that Captain Grassi would have
had to deposit with the government before he was allowed to marry You
know how it is with the poor fellows in the army there I dont
understand the process exactly but the sum is something like sixty
thousand francs I believe and poor Gigi hadnt it I always called him
Gigi but his name is Count Luigi de Popolani Grassi and he is
descended from one of the old republican families of Florence He is so
nice Mr Vostrand was opposed to him from the beginning and as soon as
he heard of the sixty thousand francs he utterly refused He called it
buying a soninlaw but I dont see why he need have looked at it in
that light However it was broken off and we left Florencemore for
poor Gigis sake than for Genevieves I must say He was quite
heartbroken I pitied him

Her voice had a tender fall in the closing words and Westover could
fancy how sweet she would make her compassion to the young man She began
several sentences aimlessly and he suggested to supply the broken
thread of her discourse rather than to offer consolation while her eyes
seemed to wander with her mind and ranged the avenue up and down Those
foreign marriages are not always successful

No they are not she assented But dont you think theyre better
with Italians than with Germans for instance

I dont suppose the Italians expect their wives to black their boots
but Ive heard that they beat them sometimes

In exaggerated cases perhaps they do Mrs Vostrand admitted And of
course she added thoughtfully there is nothing like a purely
American marriage for happiness

Westover wondered how she really regarded her own marriage but she never
betrayed any consciousness of its variance from the type




XIX

A young couple came strolling down the avenue who to Westovers artistic
eye first typified grace and strength and then to his more personal
perception identified themselves as Genevieve Vostrand and Jeff Durgin

They faltered before one of the benches beside the mall and he seemed to
be begging her to sit down She cast her eyes round till they must have
caught the window of her mothers apartment then as if she felt safe
under it she sank into the seat and Jeff put himself beside her It was
quite too early yet for the simple lovers who publicly notify their
happiness by the embraces and handclasps everywhere evident in our parks
and gardens and a Boston pair of social tradition would not have dreamed
of sitting on a bench in Commonwealth Avenue at any hour But two such
aliens as Jeff and Miss Vostrand might very well do so and Westover
sympathized with their bohemian impulse

Mrs Vostrand and he watched them awhile in talk that straggled away
from them and became more and more distraught in view of them Jeff
leaned forward and drew on the ground with the point of his stick
Genevieve held her head motionless at a pensive droop It was only their
backs that Westover could see and he could not of course make out a
syllable of what was effectively their silence but all the same he began
to feel as if he were peeping and eavesdropping Mrs Vostrand seemed not
to share his feeling and there was no reason why he should have it if
she had not He offered to go but she said No no he must not think of
it till Genevieve came in and she added some banalities about her always
scolding when she had missed one of his calls they would be so few now
at the most

Why do you intend to go so soon he asked

She did not seem to hear him and he could see that she was watching the
young people intently Jeff had turned his face up toward Genevieve
without lifting his person and was saying something she suddenly shrank
back from She made a start as if to rise but he put out his hand in
front of her beseechingly or compellingly and she sank down again But
she slowly shook her head at what he was saying and turned her face
toward him so that it gave her profile to the spectators In that light
and at that distance it was impossible to do more than fancy anything
fateful in the words which she seemed to be uttering but Westover chose
to fancy this Jeff waited a moment in apparent silence after she had
spoken He sat erect and faced her and this gave his profile too He
must have spoken for she shook her head again and then at other words
from him nodded assentingly Then she listened motionlessly while he
poured a rapid stream of visible but inaudible words He put out his
hand as if to take hers but she put it behind her Westover could see
it white there against the belt of her dark dress

Jeff went on more vehemently but she remained steadfast slowly shaking
her head When he ended she spoke and with something of his own energy
he made a gesture of submission and when she rose he rose too She
stood a moment and with a gentle and almost entreating movement she put
out her hand to him He stood looking down with both his hands resting
on the top of his stick as if ignoring her proffer Then he suddenly
caught her hand held it a moment dropped it and walked quickly away
without looking back Genevieve ran across the lawn and roadway toward
the house

Oh must you go Mrs Vostrand said to Westover He found that he had
probably risen in sympathy with Jeffs action He was not aware of an
intention of going but he thought he had better not correct Mrs
Vostrands error

Yes I really must now he said

Well then she returned distractedly do come often

He hurried out to avoid meeting Genevieve He passed her on the public
stairs of the house but he saw that she did not recognize him in the dim
light

Late that night he was startled by steps that seemed to be seeking their
way up the stairs to his landing and then by a heavy knock on his door
He opened it and confronted Jeff Durgin

May I come in Mr Westover he asked with unwonted deference

Yes come in said Westover with no great relish setting his door
open and then holding onto it a moment as if he hoped that having come
in Jeff might instantly go out again

His reluctance was lost upon Jeff who said unconscious of keeping his
hat on I want to talk with youI want to tell you something

All right Wont you sit down

At this invitation Jeff seemed reminded to take his hat off and he put
it on the floor beside his chair Im not in a scrape this timeor
rather Im in the worst kind of a scrape though it isnt the kind that
you want bail for

Yes Westover prompted

I dont know whether youve noticedand if you havent it dont make
any differencethat Ive seemed tocare a good deal for Miss Vostrand

Westover saw no reason why he should not be frank and said Too much
Ive fancied sometimes for a student in his Sophomore year

Yes I know that Well its over whether it was too much or too
little He laughed in a joyless helpless way and looked deprecatingly
at Westover I guess Ive been making a fool of myselfthats all

Its better to make a fool of ones self than to make a fool of some one
else said Westover oracularly

Yes said Jeff apparently finding nothing more definite in the oracle
than people commonly find in oracles But I think he went on with a
touch of bitterness that her mother might have told me that she was
engagedor the same as engaged

I dont know that she was bound to take you seriously or to suppose you
took yourself so at your age and with your prospects in life If you
want to knowWestover faltered and then went onshe began to be kind
to you because she was afraid that you might think she didnt take your
coming home secondcabin in the right way and one thing led to another
You mustnt blame her for whats happened

Westover defended Mrs Vostrand but he did not feel strong in her
defence he was not sure that Durgin was quite wrong absurd as he had
been He sat down and looked up at his visitor under his brows

What are you here for Jeff Not to complain of Mrs Vostrand

Jeff gave a short shamefaced laugh No its this youre such an old
friend of Mrs Vostrands that I thought shed be pretty sure to tell you
about it and I wanted to askto askthat you wouldnt say anything to
mother

You are a boy I shouldnt think of meddling with your affairs said
Westover he got up again and Jeff rose too

Before noon the next day a district messenger brought Westover a letter
which he easily knew from the now belated tall angular hand to be
from Mrs Vostrand It announced on a much crisscrossed little sheet
that she and Genevieve were inconsolably taking a very sudden departure
and were going on the twelveoclock train to New York where Mr
Vostrand was to meet them In regard to that affair which I mentioned
last night he withdraws his objections we have had an overnight
telegram and so I suppose all will go well I cannot tell you how sorry
we both are not to see you again you have been such a dear good friend
to us and if you dont hear from us again at New York you will from the
other side Genevieve had some very strange news when she came in and we
both feel very sorry for the poor young fellow You must console him from
us all you can I did not know before how much she was attached to Gigi
but it turned out very fortunately that she could say she considered
herself bound to him and did everything to save Mr Ds feelings




XX

Westover was not at Lions Head again till the summer before Jeffs
graduation In the mean time the hotel had grown like a living thing He
could not have imagined wings in connection with the main edifice but it
had put forth wingsone that sheltered a new and enlarged diningroom
with two stories of chambers above and another that hovered a parlor and
ballroom under a like provision of chambers An ell had been pushed back
on the level behind the house the barn had been moved farther to the
southward and on its old site a laundry built with quarters for the
help over it All had been carefully frugally yet sufficiently done
and Westover was not surprised to learn that it was all the effect of
Jackson Durgins ingenuity and energy Mrs Durgin confessed to having no
part in it but she had kept pace with Cynthia Whitwells help in the
housekeeping As Jackson had cautiously felt his way to the needs of
their public in the enlargement and rearrangement of the hotel the two
housewives had watchfully studied not merely the demands but the
halfconscious instincts of their guests and had responded to them
simply and adequately in the spirit of Jacksons exterior and structural
improvements The walls of the new rooms were left unpapered and their
floors uncarpeted there were thin rugs put down the woodwork was
merely stained Westover found that he need not to ask especially for
some hot dish at night there was almost the abundance of a dinner
though dinner was still at one oclock

Mrs Durgin asked him the first day if he would not like to go into the
servingroom and see it while they were serving dinner She tried to
conceal her pride in the busy scenethe waitresses pushing in through
one valve of the doublehinged doors with their empty trays and out
through the other with the trays full laden delivering their dishes with
the broken victual at the wicket where the untouched portions were put
aside and the rest poured into the waste following in procession along
the reeking steamtable with its great tanks of soup and vegetables
where the carvers stood with the joints and the trussed fowls smoking
before them which they sliced with quick sweeps of their blades or
waiting their turn at the board where the little plates with portions of
fruit and dessert stood ready All went regularly on amid a clatter of
knives and voices and dishes and the clashing rise and fall of the wire
baskets plunging the soiled crockery into misty depths whence it came up
clean and dry without the touch of finger or towel Westover could not
deny that there were elements of the picturesque in it so that he did
not respond quite in kind to Jeffs suggestionScene for a painter Mr
Westover

The young fellow followed satirically at his mothers elbow and made a
mock of her pride in it trying to catch Westovers eye when she led him
through the kitchen with its immense range and introduced him to a new
chef who wiped his hand on his white apron to offer it to Westover

Dont let him get away without seeing the laundry mother her son
jeered at a final air of absentmindedness in her and she defiantly
accepted his challenge

Jeffs mad because he wasnt consulted she explained and because we
dont run the house like his onehorse European hotels

Oh Im not in it at all Mr Westover said the young fellow Im as
much a passenger as you are The only difference is that Im allowed to
work my passage

Well one thing said his mother is that weve got a higher class of
boarders than we ever had before Youll see Mr Westover if you stay
on here till August Theres a class that boards all the year round and
that knows what a hotel isabout as well as Jeff I guess Youll find
em at the big city houses the first of the winter and then they go
down to Floridy or Georgy for February and March and they get up to
Fortress Monroe in April and work along north about the middle of May to
them family hotels in the suburbs around Boston and they stay there till
its time to go to the shore They stay at the shore through July and
then they come here in August and stay till the leaves turn Theyre
folks that live on their money and theyre the very highest class I
guess Its a round of gayety with em the whole year through

Jeff from the vantage of his greater worldly experience was trying to
exchange looks of intelligence with Westover concerning those
hoteldwellers whom his mother revered as aristocrats but he did not
openly question her conceptions Theyve told me how they do some of
the ladies have she went on Theyve got the money for it and they
know how to get the most for their money Why Mr Westover weve got
rooms in this house now that we let for thirtyfive to fifty dollars a
week for two persons and folks like that take em right along through
August and September and want a room apiece Its different now I can
tell you from what it was when folks thought we was killin em if we
wanted ten or twelve dollars

Westover had finished his dinner before this tour of the house began and
when it was over the two men strolled away together

You see its on the regular American lines Jeff pursued after
parting with his mother Jacksons done it and he cant imagine
anything else I dont say it isnt well done in its way but the ways
wrong its stupid and clumsy When they were got so far from the hotel
as to command a prospect of its ungainly mass sprawled upon the plateau
his smouldering disgust burst out Look at it Did you ever see anything
like it I wish the damned thing would burn upor down

Westover was aware in more ways than one of Jeffs exclusion from
authority in the place where he was constantly set aside from the
management as if his future were so definitely dedicated to another
calling that not even his advice was desired or permitted and he could
not help sympathizing a little with him when he chafed at his rejection
He saw a great deal of him and he thought him quite up to the average of
Harvards Seniors in some essentials He had been sobered apparently by
experience his unfortunate loveaffair seemed to have improved him as
the phrase is

They had some long walks and long talks together and in one of them Jeff
opened his mind if not his heart to the painter He wanted to be the
Landlord of the Lions Head which he believed he could make the best
hotel in the mountains He knew of course that he could not hope to
make any changes that did not suit his mother and his brother as long as
they had the control but he thought they would let him have the control
sooner if his mother could only be got to give up the notion of his being
a lawyer As nearly as he could guess she wanted him to be a lawyer
because she did not want him to be a hotelkeeper and her prejudice
against that was because she believed that selling liquor made her father
a drunkard

Well now you know enough about me Mr Westover to know that drink
isnt my danger

Yes I think I do said Westover

I went a little wild in my Freshman year and I got into that scrape
but Ive never been the worse for liquor since fact is I never touch it
now There isnt any more reason why I should take to drink because I
keep a hotel than Jackson but just that one time has set mother against
it and I cant seem to make her understand that once is enough for me
Why I should keep a temperance house here of course you cant do
anything else in these days If I was left to choose between
hotelkeeping and any other life that I know of Id choose it every
time Jeff went on after a moment of silence I like a hotel You can
be your own man from the start the starts made here and Ive helped to
make it All youve got to do is to have commonsense in the hotel
business and youre sure to succeed I believe Ive got commonsense
and I believe Ive got some ideas that I can work up into a great
success The reason that most people fail in the hotel business is that
they waste so much and the landlord that wastes on his guests cant
treat them well Its got so now that in the big city houses they cant
make anything on feeding people and so they try to make it up on the
rooms I should feed them wellI believe I know howand I should make
money on my table as they do in Europe

Ive thought a good many things out my mind runs on it all the time
but Im not going to bore you with it now

Oh not at all said Westover Id like to know what your ideas are

Well some time Ill tell you But look here Mr Westover I wish if
mother gets to talking about me with you that youd let her know how I
feel We cant talk together she and I without quarrelling about it
but I guess you could put in a word that would show her I wasnt quite a
fool She thinks Ive gone crazy from seeing the way they do things in
Europe that Im conceited and unpatriotic and I dont know what all
Jeff laughed as if with an inner fondness for his mothers
wrongheadedness

And would you be willing to settle down here in the country for the rest
of your life and throw away your Harvard training on hotelkeeping

What do the other fellows do with their Harvard training when they go
into business as ninetenths of them do Business is business whether
you keep a hotel or import drygoods or manufacture cotton or run a
railroad or help a big trust to cheat legally Harvard has got to take a
back seat when you get out of Harvard But you dont suppose that keeping
a summer hotel would mean living in the country the whole time do you
Thats the way mother does but I shouldnt It isnt good for the hotel
even If I had such a place as Lions Head I should put a man and his
family into it for the winter to look after it and I should go to town
myselfto Boston or New York or I might go to London or Paris Theyre
not so far off and its so easy to get to them that you can hardly keep
away Jeff laughed and looked up at Westover from the log where he sat
whittling a pine stick Westover sat on the stump from which the log had
been felled eight or ten years before

You are modern he said

Thats what I should do at first But I dont believe I should have
Lions Head very long before I had another hotelin Florida or the
Georgia uplands or North Carolina somewhere I should take my help back
and forth it would be as easy to run two hotels as oneeasier It would
keep my hand in But if you want to know Id rather stick here in the
country year in and year out and run Lions Head than to be a lawyer
and hang round trying to get a case for nine or ten years Whos going to
support me Do you suppose I want to live on mother till Im forty She
dont think of that She thinks I can go right into court and begin
distinguishing myself if I can fight the people off from sending me to
Congress Id rather live in the country anyway I think towns the
place for winter or twothree months of it and after that I havent got
any use for it But mother shes got this oldfashioned ambition to have
me go to a city and set up there She thinks that if I was a lawyer in
Boston I should be at the top of the heap But I know better than that
and so do you and I want you to give her some little hint of how it
really is how it takes family and money and a lot of influence to get to
the top in any city

It occurred to Westover and not for the first time that the frankest
thing in Jeff Durgin was his disposition to use his friends It seemed to
him that Jeff was always asking something of him and it did not change
the fact that in this case he thought him altogether in the right He
said that if Mrs Durgin spoke to him of the matter he would not keep the
light from her He looked behind him now for the first time in
recognition of the place where they had stopped Why this is Whitwells
Clearing

Didnt you know it Jeff asked It changes a good deal every year and
you havent been here for awhile have you

Not since Mrs Marvens picnic said Westover and he added quickly
to efface the painful association which he must have called up by his
heedless words

The woods have crowded back upon it so It cant be more than half its
old size

No Jeff assented He struck his heel against a fragment of the pine
bough he had been whittling and drove it into the soft ground beside the
log and said without looking up from it I met that woman at a dance
last winter It wasnt her dance but she was running it as if it were
just the way she did with the picnic She seemed to want to let bygones
be bygones and I danced with her daughter Shes a nice girl I thought
mother did wrong about that Now he looked at Westover She couldnt
help it but it wasnt the thing to do A hotel is a public house and
you cant act as if it wasnt If mother hadnt known how to keep a hotel
so well in other ways she might have ruined the house by not knowing in
a thing like that But weve got some of the people with us this year
that used to come here when we first took farmboarders mother dont
know that theyre ever so much nicer socially than the people that take
the fiftydollar rooms He laughed and then he said seriously If I
ever had a son I dont believe I should let my pride in him risk doing
him mischief And if youve a mind to let her understand that you believe
Im set against the law for good and all

I guess I shall not be your ambassador so far as that Why dont you
tell her yourself

She wont believe me said Jeff with a laugh She thinks I dont know
my mind And I dont like the way we differ when we differ We differ
more than we mean to I dont pretend to say Im always right She was
right about that other picnicthe one I wanted to make for Mrs
Vostrand I suppose he ended unexpectedly that you hear from them
now and then

No I dont I havent heard from them for a year not sinceYou knew
Genevieve was married

Yes I knew that said Jeff steadily

I dont quite make it all out Mr Vostrand was very much opposed to it
Mrs Vostrand told me but he must have given way at last and he must
have put up the money Jeff looked puzzled and Westover explained You
know the officers in the Italian armyand all the other armies in
Europe for that matterhave to deposit a certain sum with the
government before they can marry and in the case of Count Grassi Mr
Vostrand had to furnish the money

Jeff said after a moment Well she couldnt help that

No the girl wasnt to blame I dont know that any one was to blame
But Im afraid our girls wouldnt marry many titles if their fathers
didnt put up the money

Well I dont see why they shouldnt spend their money that way as well
as any other said Jeff and this proof of his impartiality suggested to
Westover that he was not only indifferent to the mercenary international
marriages which are a scandal to so many of our casuists but had quite
outlived his passion for the girl concerned in this

At any rate Jeff added I havent got anything to say against it Mr
Westover Ive always wanted to say one thing to you Then I came to your
room that night I wanted to complain of Mrs Vostrand for not letting me
know about the engagement and I wasnt man enough to acknowledge that
what you said would account for their letting me make a fool of myself
But I believe I am now and I want to say it

Im glad you can see it in that way said Westover and since you do
I dont mind saying that I think Mrs Vostrand might have been a little
franker with you without being less kind She was kind but she wasnt
quite frank

Well its all over now said Jeff and he rose up and brushed the
whittlings from his knees And I guess its just as well




XXI

That afternoon Westover saw Jeff helping Cynthia Whitwell into his
buckboard and then after his lively horse had made some paces of a
start spring to the seat beside her and bring it to a stand Can I do
anything for you over at Lovewell Mr Westover he called and he
smiled toward the painter Then he lightened the reins on the mares
back she squared herself for a start in earnest and flashed down the
sloping hotel road to the highway below and was lost to sight in the
clump of woods to the southward

Thats a good friend of yours Cynthy he said leaning toward the girl
with a simple comfort in her proximity She was dressed in a palepink
color with a hat of yet paler pink without having a great deal of
fashion she had a good deal of style She looked bright and fresh there
was a dash of pink in her cheeks which suggested the color of the
sweetbrier its purity and sweetness and if there was something in
Cynthias character and temperament that suggested its thorns too one
still could not deny that she was like that flower She liked to shop
and she liked to ride after a good horse as the neighbors would have
said she was going over to Lovewell to buy a number of things and Jeff
Durgin was driving her there with the swift mare that was his peculiar
property She smiled upon him without the usual reservations she
contrived to express in her smiles

Well I dont know anybody Id rather have for my friend than Mr
Westover She added He acted like a friend the very first time I saw
him

Jeff laughed with shameless pleasure in the reminiscence her words
suggested Well I did get my comeuppings that time And I dont know
but hes been a pretty good friend to me too Im not sure he likes me
but Mr Westover is a man that could be your friend if he didnt like
you

What have you done to make him like you asked the girl

Nothing said Jeff with a shout of laughter in his conviction Ive
done a lot of things to make him despise me from the start But if you
like a person yourself you want him to like you whether you deserve it
or not

I dont know as I do

You say that because you always deserve it You cant tell how it is
with a fellow like me I should want you to like me Cynthy whatever you
thought of me He looked round into her face but she turned it away

They had struck the level long for the hill country at the foot of the
hotel road and the mare that found herself neither mounting nor
descending a steep dropped from the trot proper for an acclivity into a
rapid walk

This mare can walk like a Kentucky horse said Jeff I believe I could
teach her singlefoot He added with a laugh If I knew how and now
Cynthia laughed with him

I was just going to say that

Yes you dont lose many chances to give me a dig do you

Oh I dont know as I look for them Perhaps I dont need to The pine
woods were deep on either side They whispered in the thin sweet wind
and gave out their odor in the high westering sun They covered with
their shadows the road that ran velvety between them

This is nice said Jeff letting himself rest against the back of the
seat He stretched his left arm along the top and presently it dropped
and folded itself about the waist of the girl

You may take your arm away Jeff she said quietly

Why

Because it has no right there for one thing She drew herself a little
aside and looked round at him You wouldnt put it round a town girl if
you were riding with her

I shouldnt be riding with her Girls dont go buggyriding in town any
more said Jeff brutally

Then I shall know what to do the next time you ask me

Oh theyd go quick enough if I asked them up here in the country
Etiquette dont count with them when theyre on a vacation

Im not on a vacation so it counts with me Please take your arm away
said Cynthia

Oh all right But I shouldnt object to your putting your arm around
me

You will never have the chance

Why are you so hard on me Cynthy asked Jeff You didnt used to be
so

People change

Do I

Not for the better

Jeff was dumb She was pleased with her hit and laughed But her laugh
did not encourage him to put his arm round her again He let the mare
walk on and left her to resume the conversation at whatever point she
would

She made no haste to resume it At last she said with sufficient
apparent remoteness from the subject they had dropped Jeff I dont
know whether you want me to talk about it But I guess I ought to even
if it isnt my place exactly I dont think Jacksons very well this
summer

Jeff faced round toward her What makes you think he isnt well

Hes weaker Havent you noticed it

Yes I have noticed that Hes worked down thats all

No that isnt all But if you dont think so

I want to know what you think Cynthy said Jeff with the amorous
resentment all gone from his voice Sometimes folks outside notice the
signs moreI dont mean that youre an outsider as far as were
concerned

She put by that point Fathers noticed it too and hes with Jackson a
good deal

Ill look after it If he isnt so well hes got to have a doctor That
mediums stuff cant do him any good Dont you think he ought to have a
doctor

Oh yes

You dont think a doctor can do him much good

He ought to have one said the girl noncommittally

Cynthia Ive noticed that Jackson was weak too and its no use
pretending that hes simply worked down I believe hes worn out Do you
think mothers ever noticed it

I dont believe she has

Its the one thing I cant very well make up my mind to speak to her
about I dont know what she would do He did not say If she lost
Jackson but Cynthia knew he meant that and they were both silent Of
course he went on I know that she places a great deal of dependence
upon you but Jacksons her main stay Hes a good man and hes a good
son I wish Id always been half as good

Cynthia did not protest against his selfreproach as he possibly hoped
she would She said I think Jacksons got a very good mind He reads a
great deal and hes thought a great deal and when it comes to talking
I never heard any one express themselves better The other night we were
out looking at the starsI came part of the way home with him I didnt
like to let him go alone he seemed so feeble and he got to showing me
Mars He thinks its inhabited and hes read all that the astronomers
say about it and the seas and the canals that theyve found on it He
spoke very beautifully about the other life and then he spoke about
death Cynthias voice broke and she pulled her handkerchief out of her
belt and put it to her eyes Jeffs heart melted in him at the sight he
felt a tender affection for her very unlike the gross content he had
enjoyed in her presence before and he put his arm round her again but
this time almost unconsciously and drew her toward him She did not
repel him she even allowed her head to rest a moment on his shoulder
though she quickly lifted it and drew herself away not resentfully it
seemed but for her greater freedom in talking

I dont believe hes going to die Jeff said consolingly more as if
it were her brother than his that he meant But hes a very sick man
and hes got to knock off and go somewhere It wont do for him to pass
another winter here He must go to California or Colorado theyd be
glad to have him there either of them or he can go to Florida or over
to Italy It wont matter how long he stays

What are you talking about Jeff Durgin Cynthia demanded severely
What would your mother do What would she do this winter

That brings me to something Cynthia said Jeff and I dont want you
to say anything till Ive got through I guess I could help mother run
the place as well as Jackson and I could stay here next winter

You

Now you let me talk My minds made up about one thing Im not going
to be a lawyer I dont want to go back to Harvard Im going to keep a
hotel and if I dont keep one here at Lions Head Im going to keep it
somewhere else

Have you told your mother

Not yet I wanted to hear what you would say first

I Oh I havent got anything to do with it said Cynthia

Yes you have Youve got everything to do with it if youll say one
thing first Cynthia you know how I feel about you Its been so ever
since we were boy and girl here I want you to promise to marry me Will
you

The girl seemed neither surprised nor very greatly pleased perhaps her
pleasure had spent itself in that moment of triumphant expectation when
she foresaw what was coming or perhaps she was preoccupied in clearing
the way in her own mind to a definite result

What do you say Cynthia Jeff pursued with more injury than misgiving
in his voice at her delay in answering Dont youcare for me

Oh yes I presume Ive always done thatever since we were boy and
girl as you say But

Well said Jeff patiently but not insecurely

Have you

Have I what

Always cared for me

He could not find his voice quite as promptly as before He cleared his
throat before he asked Has Mr Westover been saying anything about me

I dont know what you mean exactly but I presume you do

Well thenI always expected to tell youI did have a fancy for that
girl for Miss Vostrand and I told her so Its like something that
never happened She wouldnt have me Thats all

And you expect me to take what she wouldnt have

If you like to call it that But I should call it taking a man that had
been out of his head for a while and had come to his senses again

I dont know as I should ever feel safe with a man that had been out of
his head once

You wouldnt find many men that hadnt said Jeff with a laugh that
was rather scornful of her ignorance

No I presume not she sighed She was beautiful and I believe she
was good too She was very nice Perhaps I feel strangely about it But
if she hadnt been so nice I shouldnt have been so willing that you
should have cared for her

I suppose I dont understand said Jeff but I know I was hard hit
Whats the use Its over Shes married I cant go back and unlive it
all But if you want time to thinkof course you doIve taken time
enough

He was about to lift the reins on the mares back as a sign to her that
the talk was over for the present and to quicken her pace when Cynthia
put out her hand and laid it on his and said with a certain effect of
authority I shouldnt want you should give up your last year in
Harvard

Just as you say Cynthy and in token of intelligence he wound his arm
round her neck and kissed her It was not the first kiss by any means in
the country kisses are not counted very serious or at all binding and
Cynthia was a country girl but they both felt that this kiss sealed a
solemn troth between them and that a common life began for them with it




XXII

Cynthia came back in time to go into the diningroom and see that all was
in order there for supper before the door opened The waitresses knew
that she had been out riding as they called it with Jeff Durgin the
fact had spread electrically to them where they sat in a shady angle of
the hotel listening to one who read a novel aloud and skipped all but
the most exciting love parts They conjectured that the pair had gone to
Lovewell but they knew nothing more and the subtlest of them would not
have found reason for further conjecture in Cynthias behavior when she
came in and scanned the tables and the girls dresses and hair where
they stood ranged against the wall She was neither whiter nor redder
than usual and her nerves and her tones were under as good control as a
girls ever are after she has been out riding with a fellow It was not
such a great thing anyway to ride with Jeff Durgin First and last
nearly all the young lady boarders had been out with him upon one errand
or another to Lovewell

After supper when the girls had gone over to their rooms in the helps
quarters and the guests had gathered in the wide low office in the
light of the fire kindled on the hearth to break the evening chill Jeff
joined Cynthia in her inspection of the diningroom She always gave it a
last look to see that it was in perfect order for breakfast before she
went home for the night Jeff went home with her he was impatient of her
duties but he was in no hurry when they stole out of the side door
together under the stars and began to stray sidelong down the hill over
the dewless grass

He lingered more and more as they drew near her fathers house in the
abandon of a mans love He wished to give himself solely up to it to
think and to talk of nothing else after a mans fashion But a womans
love is no such mere delight It is serious practical For her it is all
future and she cannot give herself wholly up to any present moment of
it as a man does

Now Jeff she said after a certain number of partings in which she
had apparently kept his duty clearly in mind you had better go home and
tell your mother

Oh theres time enough for that he began

I want you to tell her right away or there wont be anything to tell

Is that so he joked back Well if I must I must I suppose But I
didnt think youd take the whiphand so soon Cynthia

Oh I dont ever want to take the whiphand with you Jeff Dont make
me

Well I wont then But what are you in such a hurry to have mother
know for Shes not going to object And if she does

It isnt that said the girl quickly If I had to go round a single
day with your mother hiding this from her I should begin to hate you I
couldnt bear the concealment I shall tell father as soon as I go in

Oh your father ll be all right of course

Yes hell be all right but if he wouldnt and I knew it I should
have to tell him all the same Now goodnight Well there then and
there Now let me go

She paused for a moment in her own room to smooth her tumbled hair and
try to identify herself in her glass Then she went into the
sittingroom where she found her father pulled up to the table with his
hat on and poring over a sheet of hieroglyphics which represented the
usual evening with planchette

Have you been to help Jackson up she asked

Well I wanted to but he wouldnt hear of it Hes feelin ever so much
better tonight and he wanted to go alone I just come in

Yes youve got your hat on yet

Whitwell put his hand up and found that his daughter was right He
laughed and said I guess I must a forgot it Weve had the most
interestin season with plantchette that I guess weve about ever had
Shes said something here

Well never mind Ive got something more important to say than
plantchette has said Cynthia and she pulled the sheet away from under
her fathers eyes

This made him look up at her Why whats happened

Nothing Jeff Durgin has asked me to marry him

He has The New England training is not such as to fit people for the
expression of strong emotion and the best that Whitwell found himself
able to do in view of the fact was to pucker his mouth for a whistle
which did not come

Yesthis afternoon said Cynthia lifelessly The tension of her
nerves relaxed in a languor which was evident even to her father though
his eyes still wandered to the sheet she had taken from him

Well you dont seem over and above excited about it Diddid
yourWhat did you say

How should I know what I said What do you think of it father

I dont know as I ever give the subject much attention said the
philosopher I always meant to take it out of him somehow if he got to
playin the fool

Then you wanted I should accept him

What difference d it make what I wanted That what you done

Yes Ive accepted him said the girl with a sigh I guess Ive
always expected to

Well I thought likely it would come to that myself All I can say
Cynthy is t hes a lucky feller

Whitwell leaned back bracing his knees against the table which was one
of his philosophic poses I have sometimes believed that Jeff Durgin was
goin to turn out a blackguard Hes got it in him Hes as like his
granfather as two peas and he was an old devil But you got to account
in all these here heredity cases for counteractin influences The
Durgins are as good as wheat right along all of em and I guess Mis
Durgins mother must have been a pretty good woman too Mis Durgins all
right too if she has got a will of her own Whitwell returned from his
scientific inquiry to ask How ll she take it

I dont know said Cynthia dreamily but without apparent misgiving
Thats Jeffs lookout

So tis I guess she wont make much fuss A woman never likes to see
her son get married but youve been a kind of daughter to her so long
Well I guess that part of it ll be all right Jackson said Whitwell
in a tone of relief as if turning from an irrelevant matter to something
of real importance was down here tonight tryin to ring up some them
spirits from the planet Mars Martians he calls em His minds got to
runnin a good deal on Mars lately I guess its this apposition that
they talk about that does it Mars comin so much nearer the earth by a
million of miles or so it stands to reason that he should be more
influenced by the minds on it I guess its a case o that telepathy that
Mr Westover tells about I judge that if he kept at it before Mars gits
off too far again he might make something out of it I couldnt seem to
find much sense in what plantchette done tonight we couldnt either of
us but she has her spells when you cant make head or tail of her But
mebbe shes just leadin up to something the way she did about that
broken shaft when Jeff come home We hant ever made out exactly what
she meant by that yet

Whitwell paused and Cynthia seized the advantage of his getting round to
Jeff again He wanted to give up going to Harvard this last year but I
wouldnt let him

Jeff did asked her father Well you done a good thing that time
anyway Cynthy His mother d never get over it

Theres something else shes got to get over and I dont know how she
ever will Hes going to give up the law

Give up the law

Yes Dont tease father He says hes never cared about it and he
wants to keep a hotel I thought that Id ought to tell him how we felt
about Jacksons having a rest and going off somewhere and he wanted to
begin at once But I said if he left off the last year at Harvard I
wouldnt have anything to do with him

Whitwell put his hand in his pocket for his knife and mechanically
looked down for a stick to whittle In default of any he scratched his
head I guess shell make it warm for him Shes had her mind set on his
studyin law so long t she wont give up in a hurry She cant see that
Jackson aint fit to help her run the hotel any moretill hes had a
rest anywayand I believe she thinks her and Frank could run itand
you Shell make an awful kick said Whitwell solemnly I hope you
didnt encourage him Cynthy

I should encourage him said the girl Hes got the right to shape his
own life and nobody else has got the right to do it and I should tell
his mother so if she ever said anything to me about it

All right said Whitwell I suppose you know what youre about

I do father Jeff would make a good landlord hes got ideas about a
hotel and I can see that theyre the right ones Hes been out in the
world and hes kept his eyes open He will make Lions Head the best
hotel in the mountains

Its that already

He doesnt think its half as good as he can make it

It wouldnt be half what it is now if it want for you and Frank

I guess he understands that said Cynthia Frank would be the clerk

Got it all mapped out said Whitwell proudly in his turn Look out
you dont slip up in your calculations Thats all

I guess we chant slip up




XIII

Jeff came into the ugly old family parlor where his mother sat mending
by the kerosenelamp which she had kept through all the household
changes and pushed enough of her work aside from the corner of the table
to rest his arm upon it

Mother I want you to listen to me and to wait till I get done Will
you

She looked up at him over her spectacles from the stocking she was
darning the china egg gleamed through the frayed place What notion
have you got in your head now

Its about Jackson He isnt well Hes got to leave off work and go
away

The mothers hand dropped at the end of the yarn she had drawn through
the stocking heel and she stared at Jeff Then she resumed her work with
the decision expressed in her tone Your father lived to be sixty years
old and Jackson ant forty The doctor said there want any reason why
he shouldnt live as long as his father did

Im not saying he wont live to a hundred Im saying he oughtnt to
stay another winter here Jeff said decisively

Mrs Durgin was silent for a time and then she said Jeff is that your
notion about Jackson or whose is it

Its mine now

Mrs Durgin waited a moment Then she began with a feeling quite at
variance with her words

Well Ill thank Cynthy Whitell to mind her own business Of course
she added and in what followed her feeling worked to the surface in her
words I know t she thinks the world of Jackson and he does of her
and I presume she means well I guess shed be more apt to notice if
there was any change than what I should What did she say

Jeff told as nearly as he could remember and he told what Cynthia and
he had afterward jointly worked out as to the best thing for Jackson to
do Mrs Durgin listened frowningly but not disapprovingly as it
seemed though at the end she asked And what am I going to do with
Jackson gone

Jeff laughed with his head down Well I guess you and Cynthy could run
it with Frank and Mr Whitwell

Mr Whitell said Mrs Durgin concentrating in her accent of his name
the contempt she could not justly pour out on the others

Oh Jeff went on I did think that I could take hold with you if you
could bring yourself to let me off this last year at Harvard

Jeff said his mother reproachfully You know you dont mean that
youd give up your last year in college

I do mean it but I dont expect you to do it and I dont ask it I
suggested it to Cynthy when we got to talking it over and she saw it
wouldnt do

Well she showed some sense that time Mrs Durgin said

I dont know when Cynthy hasnt shown sense except once and then I
guess it was my fault

What do you mean

Why this afternoon I asked her to marry me some time and she said she
would He looked at his mother and laughed and then he did not laugh
He had expected her to be pleased he had thought to pave the way with
this confession for the declaration of his intention not to study law
and to make his engagement to Cynthia serve him in reconciling his mother
to the other fact But a menacing suspense followed his words

His mother broke out at last You asked Cynthy Whitell to marry you
And she said she would Well I can tell her she wont then

And I can tell you she will Jeff stormed back He rose to his feet and
stood over his mother

She began steadily as if he had not spoken If that designin

Look out mother Dont you say anything against Cynthia Shes been the
best girl to you in the world and you know it Shes been as true to you
as Jackson has himself She hasnt got a selfish bone in her body and
shes so honest she couldnt design anything against you or any one
unless she told you first Now you take that back Take it back Shes no
more designing thanthan you are

Mrs Durgin was not moved by his storming but she was inwardly convinced
of error I do take it back Cynthy is all right Shes all you say and
more Its your fault then and youve got yourself to thank for
whosever fault it is shell pack

If Cynthy packs I pack said Jeff Understand that The moment she
leaves this house I leave it too and Ill marry her anyway Frank d
leave andandPshaw What do you care for that But I dont know what
you mean I always thought you liked Cynthy and respected her I didnt
believe I could tell you a thing that would please you better than that
she had said she would have me But if it dont all right

Mrs Durgin held her peace in bewilderment she stared at her son with
dazed eyes under the spectacles lifted above her forehead She felt a
change of mood in his unchanged tone of defiance and she met him
halfway I tell you I take back what I called Cynthia and I told you
so Butbut I didnt ever expect you to marry her

Why didnt you There isnt one of the summer folks to compare with her
Shes got more sense than all of em Ive known her ever since I can
remember Why didnt you expect it

I didnt expect it

Oh I know You thought Id see somebody in Bostonsome swell girl
Well they wouldnt any of them look at me and if they would they
wouldnt look at you

I shouldnt care whether they looked at me or not

I tell you they wouldnt look at me You dont understand about these
things and I do They marry their own kind and Im not their kind and
I shouldnt be if I was Daniel Webster himself Daniel Webster Who
remembers him or cares for him or ever did You dont believe it You
think that because Ive been at HarvardOh cant I make you see it Im
what they call a jay in Harvard and Harvard dont count if youre a
jay

His mother looked at him without speaking She would not confess the
ambition he taxed her with and perhaps she had nothing so definite in
her mind Perhaps it was only her pride in him and her faith in a
splendid future for him that made her averse to his marriage in the lot
she had always known and on a little lower level in it that her own She
said at last

I dont know what you mean by being a jay But I guess we better not say
anything more about this tonight

All right Jeff returned There never were any formal goodnights
between the Durgins and he went away now without further words

His mother remained sitting where he left her Two or three times she
drew her empty darningneedle through the heel of the stocking she was
mending

She was still sitting there when Jackson passed on his way to bed after
leaving the office in charge of the night porter He faltered as he went
by and as he stood on the threshold she told him what Jeff had told her

Thats good he said lifelessly Good for Jeff he added
thoughtfully conscientiously

Why ant it good for her too demanded Jeffs mother in quick
resentment of the slight put upon him

I didnt say it want said Jackson But its better for Jeff

She may be very glad to get him

I presume she is Shes always cared for him I guess Shell know how
to manage him

I dont know said Mrs Durgin as I like to have you talk so about
Jeff He was here just now wantin to give up his last year in Harvard
so s to let you go off on a vacation He thinks youve worked yourself
down

Jackson made no recognition of Jeffs professed selfsacrifice I dont
want any vacation Im feeling firstrate now I guess that stuff I had
from the writin medium has begun to take hold of me I dont know when
Ive felt so well I believe Im going to get stronger than ever I was
Jeff say I needed a rest

Something like a smile of compassion for the delusion of his brother
dawned upon the sick mans wasted face which was blotched with large
freckles and stared with dim large eyes from out a framework of grayish
hair and grayish beard cut to the edges of the cheeks and chin




XXIV

Mrs Durgin and Cynthia did not seek any formal meeting the next morning
The course of their work brought them together but it was not till after
they had transacted several household affairs of pressing importance that
Mrs Durgin asked Whats this about you and Jeff

Has he been telling you asked Cynthia in her turn though she knew he
had

Yes said Mrs Durgin with a certain dryness which was half humorous
I presume if you two are satisfied its all right

I guess were satisfied said the girl with a tremor of relief which
she tried to hide

Nothing more was said and there was no physical demonstration of
affection or rejoicing between the women They knew that the time would
come when they would talk over the affair down to the bone together but
now they were content to recognize the fact and let the time for talking
arrive when it would I guess said Mrs Durgin youd better go over
to the helps house and see how that youngest Miller girls gittin
along Shed ought to give up and go home if she ant fit for her work

Ill go and see her said Cynthia I dont believe shes strong enough
for a waitress and I have got to tell her so

Well returned Mrs Durgin glumly after a moments reflection I
shouldnt want you should hurry her Wait till shes out of bed and give
her another chance

All right

Jeff had been lurking about for the event of the interview and he
waylaid Cynthia on the path to the helps house

Im going over to see that youngest Miller girl she explained

Yes I know all about that said Jeff Well mother took it just
right didnt she You cant always count on her but I hadnt much
anxiety in this case She likes you Cynthia

I guess so said the girl demurely and she looked away from him to
smile her pleasure in the fact

But I believe if she hadnt known you were with her about my last year
in Harvardit would have been different I could see when I brought it
in that you wanted me to go back her mind was made up for you

Why need you say anything about that

Oh I knew it would clinch her I understand mother If you want
something from her you mustnt ask it straight out You must propose
something very disagreeable Then when she refuses that you can come in
for what you were really after and get it

I dont know said Cynthia as I should like to think that your mother
had been tricked into feeling right about me

Tricked The color flashed up in Jeffs face

Not that Jeff said the girl tenderly But you know what I mean I
hope you talked it all out fully with her

Fully I dont know what you mean

About your not studying law andeverything

I dont believe in crossing a river till I come to it said Jeff I
didnt say anything to her about that

You didnt

No What had it got to do with our being engaged

What had your going back to Harvard to do with it If your mother thinks
Im with her in that shell think Im with her in the other And Im
not Im with you She let her hand find his as they walked side by
side and gave it a little pressure

Its the greatest thing Cynthy he said breathlessly to have you
with me in that But if you said I ought to study law I should do it

I shouldnt say that for I believe youre right but even if I believed
you were wrong I shouldnt say it You have a right to make your life
what you want it and your mother hasnt Only she must know it and you
must tell her at once

At once

Yesnow What good will it do to put it off Youre not afraid to tell
her

I dont like you to use that word

And I dont like to use it But I know how it is Youre afraid that the
brunt of it will come on ME Shell think youre all right but Im all
wrong because I agree with you

Something like that

Well now Im not afraid of anything she can say and what could she
do She cant part us unless you let her and then I should let her
too

But whats the hurry Whats the need of doing it right off

Because its a deceit not to do it Its a lie

I dont see it in that light I might change my mind and still go on
and study law

You know you never will Now Jeff Why do you act so

Jeff did not answer at once He walked beside her with a face of trouble
that became one of resolve in the set jaws I guess youre right
Cynthy Shes got to know the worst and the sooner she knows it the
better

Yes

He had another moment of faltering You dont want I should talk it over
with Mr Westover

What has he got to do with it

Thats true

If you want to see it in the right light you can think youve let it
run on till after youre out of college and then youve got to tell her
Suppose she asked you how long you had made up your mind against the law
how should you feel And if she asked me whether Id known it all along
and I had to say I had and that Id supported and encouraged you in it
how should I feel

She mightnt ask any such question said Jeff gloomily Cynthia gave a
little impatient Oh and he hastened to add But youre right Ive
got to tell her Ill tell her tonight

Dont wait till tonight do it now

Now

Yes and Ill go with you as soon as Ive seen the youngest Miller
girl They had reached the helps house now and Cynthia said You wait
outside here and Ill go right back with you Oh I hope it isnt doing
wrong to put it off till Ive seen that girl She disappeared through
the door and Jeff waited by the steps outside plucking up one long
grass stem after another and biting it in two When Cynthia came out she
said I guess shell be all right Now come and dontlose another
second

Youre afraid I shant do it if I wait any longer

Im afraid I shant There was a silence after this

Do you know what I think of you Cynthy asked Jeff hurrying to keep
up with her quick steps Youve got more courage

Oh dont praise me or I shall break down

Ill see that you dont break down said Jeff tenderly Its the
greatest thing to have you go with me

Why dont you SEE she lamented If you went alone and told your
mother that I approved of it you would look as if you were afraid and
wanted to get behind me and Im not going to have that

They found Mrs Durgin in the dark entry of the old farmhouse and
Cynthia said with involuntary imperiousness Come in here Mrs Durgin
I want to tell you something

She led the way to the old parlor and she checked Mrs Durgins
question Has that Miller girl

It isnt about her said Cynthy pushing the door to Its about me
and Jeff

Mrs Durgin became aware of Jeffs presence with an effect of surprise
There ant anything more is there

Yes there is Cynthia shrilled Now Jeff

Its just this mother Cynthy thinks I ought to tell youand she
thinks I ought to have told you last nightshe expected me tothat Im
not going to study law

And I approve of his not doing it Cynthia promptly followed and she
put herself beside Jeff where he stood in front of his mothers
rockingchair

She looked from one to the other of the faces before her Im sorry a
son of mine she said with dignity had to be told how to act with his
mother But if he had I dont know as anybody had a better right to do
it than the girl thats going to marry him And Ill say this Cynthia
Whitwell before I say anything else youve begun right I wish I could
say Jeff had

There was an uncomfortable moment before Cynthia said He expected to
tell you

Oh Yes I know said his mother sadly She added sharply And did he
expect to tell me what he intended to do for a livin

Jeff took the word Yes I did I intend to keep a hotel

What hotel asked Mrs Durgin with a touch of taunting in her tone

This one

The mother of the bold rebellious boy that Jeff had been stirred in Mrs
Durgins heart and she looked at him with the eyes that used to condone
his mischief But she said I guess youll find out that theres more
than one has to agree to that

Yes there are two you and Jackson and I dont know but what three if
you count Cynthy here

His mother turned to the girl You think this fellows got sense enough
to keep a hotel

Yes Mrs Durgin I do I think hes got good ideas about a hotel

And whats he goin to do with his college education

Jeff interposed You think that all the college graduates turn out
lawyers and doctors and professors Some of em are mighty glad to sweep
out banks in hopes of a clerkship and some take any sort of a place in a
mill or a business house to work up and some bum round out West on
cattle ranches and some if theyre lucky get newspaper reporters
places at ten dollars a week

Cynthia followed with the generalization I dont believe anybody can
know too much to keep a hotel It wont hurt Jeff if hes been to
Harvard or to Europe either

I guess theres a pair of you said Mrs Durgin with superficial
contempt She was silent for a time and they waited Well there she
broke out again Ive got something to chew upon for a spell I guess
Go along now both of you And the next time youve got to face your
mother Jeff dont you come in lookin round anybodys petticoats Ill
see you later about all this

They went away with the joyful shame of children who have escaped
punishment

Thats the last of it Cynthy said Jeff

I guess so the girl assented with a certain grief in her voice I
wish you had told her first

Oh never mind that now cried Jeff and in the dim passageway he took
her in his arms and kissed her

He would have released her but she lingered in his embrace Will you
promise that if theres ever anything like it again you wont wait for
me to make you

I like your having made me but I promise he said

Then she tightened her arms round his neck and kissed him




XXV

The will of Jeffs mother relaxed its grip upon the purpose so long held
as if the mere strain of the tenacity had wearied and weakened it When
it finally appeared that her ambition for her son was not his ambition
for himself and would never be she abandoned it Perhaps it was the
easier for her to forego her hopes of his distinction in the world
because she had learned before that she must forego her hopes of him in
other ways She had vaguely fancied that with the acquaintance his career
at Harvard would open to him Jeff would make a splendid marriage She had
followed darkling and stumbling his course in society as far as he would
report it to her and when he would not suffer her to glory in it she
believed that he was forbidding her from a pride that would not recognize
anything out of the common in it She exulted in his pride and she took
all his snubbing reserves tenderly as so many proofs of his success

At the bottom of her heart she had both fear and contempt of all
townspeople whom she generalized from her experience of them as summer
folks of a greater or lesser silliness She often found herself unable to
cope with them even when she felt that she had twice their sense she
perceived that they had something from their training that with all her
undisciplined force she could never hope to win from her own environment
But she believed that her son would have the advantages which baffled her
in them for he would have their environment and she had wished him to
rivet his hold upon those advantages by taking a wife from among them
and by living the life of their world Her wishes of course had no such
distinct formulation and the feeling she had toward Cynthia as a
possible barrier to her ambition had no more definition There had been
times when the fitness of her marriage with Jeff had moved the mothers
heart to a jealousy that she always kept silent while she hoped for the
accident or the providence which should annul the danger But Genevieve
Vostrand had not been the kind of accident or the providence that she
would have invoked and when she saw Jeffs fancy turning toward her
Mrs Durgin had veered round to Cynthia All the same she kept a keen eye
upon the young ladies among the summer folks who came to Lions Head and
tacitly canvassed their merits and inclinations with respect to Jeff in
the oftenimagined event of his caring for any one of them She found
that her artfully casual references to her sons being in Harvard
scarcely affected their mothers in the right way The fact made them
think of the head waiters whom they had met at other hotels and who were
working their way through Dartmouth or Williams or Yale and it required
all the force of Jeffs robust personality to dissipate their erroneous
impressions of him He took their daughters out of their arms and from
under their noses on long drives upon his buckboard and it became a
convention with them to treat his attentions somewhat like those of a
powerful but faithful vassal

Whether he was indifferent or whether the young ladies were coy none of
these official flirtations came to anything He seemed not to care for
one more than another he laughed and joked with them all and had an
official manner with each which served somewhat like a disparity of years
in putting them at their ease with him They agreed that he was very
handsome and some thought him very talented but they questioned whether
he was quite what you would call a gentleman It is true that this
misgiving attacked them mostly in the mass singly they were little or
not at all troubled by it and they severally behaved in an unprincipled
indifference to it

Mrs Durgin had the courage of her own purposes but she had the fear of
Jeffs After the first pang of the disappointment which took final shape
from his declaration that he was going to marry Cynthia she did not
really care much She had the habit of the girl she respected her she
even loved her The children as she thought of them had known each
other from their earliest days Jeff had persecuted Cynthia throughout
his graceless boyhood but he had never intimidated her and his mother
with all her weakness for him felt that it was well for him that his
wife should be brave enough to stand up against him

She formulated this feeling no more than the others but she said to
Westover whom Jeff bade her tell of the engagement It ant exactly as
I could a wished it to be But I dont know as mothers are ever quite
suited with their childrens marriages I presume its from always kind
of havin had her round under my feet ever since she was born as you may
say and seein her family always so shiftless Well I cant say that of
Frank either Hes turned out a fine boy but the father Cynthy is one
of the most capable girls smart as a trap and bright as a biscuit
Shes masterful too she NEED to have a will of her own with Jeff

Something of the insensate pride that mothers have in their childrens
faults as their quick tempers or their wastefulness or their
revengefulness expressed itself in her tone and it was perhaps this
that irritated Westover

I hope hell never let her know it I dont think a strong will is a
thing to be prized and I shouldnt consider it one of Cynthias good
points The happiest life for her would be one that never forced her to
use it

I dont know as I understand you exactly said Mrs Durgin with some
dryness I know Jeffs got rather of a domineering disposition but I
dont believe but she can manage him without meetin him on his own
ground as you may say

Shes a girl in a thousand Westover returned evasively

Then you think hes shown sense in choosin of her pursued Jeffs
mother resolute to find some praise of him in Westovers words

Hes a very fortunate man said the painter

Well I guess youre right Mrs Durgin acquiesced as much to Jeffs
advantage as she could You know I was always afraid he would make a
fool of himself but I guess hes kept his eyes pretty well open all the
while Well She closed the subject with this exclamation Him and
Cynthys been at me about Jackson she added abruptly Theyve cooked
it up between em that hes out of health or run down or something

Her manner referred the matter to Westover and he said He isnt
looking so well this summer He ought to go away somewhere

Thats what they thought said Mrs Durgin smiling in her pleasure at
having their opinion confirmed by the old and valued friend of the
family

Whereabouts do you think hed best go

Oh I dont know Italyor Egypt

I guess if you could get Jackson to go away at all it would be to some
of them old Bible countries said Mrs Durgin Weve got to have a
fight to get him off make the best of it and Ive thought it over since
the children spoke about it and I couldnt seem to see Jackson willin
to go out to Californy or Colorady to either of his brothers But I
guess he would go to Egypt That a good climate for thehis complaint

She entered eagerly into the question and Westover promised to write to
a Boston doctor whom he knew very well and report Jacksons case to
him and get his views of Egypt

Tell him how it is said Mrs Durgin and the tussle we shall have to
have anyway to make Jackson believe hed ought to have a rest Hell go
to Egypt if hell go anywheres because his mind keeps runnin on Bible
questions and it ll interest him to go out there and we can make him
believe its just to bang around for the winter Hes terrible hopeful
Now that she began to speak all her longrepressed anxiety poured itself
out and she hitched her chair nearer to Westover and wistfully clutched
his sleeve Thats the worst of Jackson You cant make him believe
anythings the matter Sometimes I cant bear to hear him go on about
himself as if he was a well young man He expects that mediums stuff is
goin to cure him

People sick in that way are always hopeful said Westover

Oh dont I know it Hant I seen my children and my husbandOh do
ask that doctor to answer as quick as he can




XXVI

Westover had a difficulty in congratulating Jeff which he could scarcely
define to himself but which was like that obscure resentment we feel
toward people whom we think unequal to their good fortune He was ashamed
of his grudge whatever it was and this may have made him overdo his
expressions of pleasure He was sensible of a false cordiality in them
and he checked himself in a flow of forced sentiment to say more
honestly I wish youd speak to Cynthia for me You know how much I
think of her and how much I want to see her happy You ought to be a
very good fellow Jeff

Ill tell her that shell like that said Jeff She thinks the world
of you

Does she Well

And I guess shell be glad you sent word Shes been wondering what you
would say shes always so afraid of you

Is she Youre not afraid of me are you But perhaps you dont think so
much of me

I guess Cynthia and I think alike on that point said Jeff without
abating Westovers discomfort

There was a stress of sharp cold that year about the 20th of August Then
the weather turned warm again and held fine till the beginning of
October within a week of the time when Jackson was to sail It had not
been so hard to make him consent when he knew where the doctor wished him
to go and he had willingly profited by Westovers suggestions about
getting to Egypt His interest in the matter which he tried to hide at
first under a mask of decorous indifference mounted with the fire of
Whitwells enthusiasm and they held nightly councils together studying
his course on the map and consulting planchette upon the points at
variance that rose between them while Jombateeste sat with his chair
tilted against the wall and pulled steadily at his pipe which mixed its
strong fumes with the smell of the kerosenelamp and the perennial odor
of potatoes in the cellar under the low room where the companions
forgathered

Toward the end of September Westover spent the night before he went back
to town with them After a season with planchette their host pushed
himself back with his knees from the table till his chair reared upon its
hind legs and shoved his hat up from his forehead in token of
philosophical mood

I tell you Jackson he said youd ought to get hold o some them
occult devils out there and squeeze their science out of em Any
Buddhists in Egypt Mr Westover

I dont think there are said Westover Unless Jackson should come
across some wandering Hindu Or he might push on and come home by the
way of India

Do it Jackson his friend conjured him May cost you something more
but it ll be worth the money If its true what some them Blavetsky
fellers claim you can visit us here in your astral bodygit in with em
the right way I should like to have you try it Whats the reason India
wouldnt be as good for him as Egypt anyway Whitwell demanded of
Westover

I suppose the climates rather too moist the heat would be rather
trying to him there

That so

And hes taken his ticket for Alexandria Westover pursued

Well I guess thats so Whitwell tilted his backward sloping hat to
one side so as to scratch the northeast corner of his bead thoughtfully

But as far as that is concerned said Westover and the doctrine of
immortality generally is concerned Jackson will have his hands full if
he studies the Egyptian monuments

What they got to do with it

Everything Egypt is the home of the belief in a future life it was
carried from Egypt to Greece He might come home by way of Athens

Why man cried Whitwell Do you mean to say that them old Hebrew
saints Josephs brethren that went down into Egypt after corn didnt
know about immortality and them Egyptian devils did

Theres very little proof in the Old Testament that the Israelites knew
of it

Whitwell looked at Jackson That the idee you got

I guess hes right said Jackson Theres something a little about it
in Job and something in the Psalms but not a great deal

And we got it from them Egyptian d

I dont say that Westover interposed But they had it before we had
As we imagine it we got it though Christianity

Jombateeste who had taken his pipe out of his mouth in a controversial
manner put it back again

Westover added But theres no question but the Egyptians believed in
the life hereafter and in future rewards and punishments for the deeds
done in the body thousands of years before our era

Well Im dumned said Whitwell

Jombateeste took his pipe out again Hit show they got good sense They
knowthey feel it in their bonewhat goin appenwhen you dead Me I
guess they got some prophet find it hout for them then they goin take
the credit

I guess thats something so Jombateeste said Whitwell It dont
stand to reason that folks without any alphabet as you may say and only
a lot of pictures for words like Injuns could figure out the
immortality of the soul They got the idee by inspiration somehow Why
here Its like this Them Pharaohs must have always been clawin out for
the Hebrews before they got a hold of Joseph and when they found out the
true doctrine they hushed up where they got it and their priests went
on teachin it as if it was their own

Thats wat I say Got it from the Ebrew

Well it dont matter a great deal where they got it so they got it
said Jackson as he rose

I believe Ill go with you said Westover

All there is about it said the sick man solemnly with a frail effort
to straighten himself to which his sunken chest would not respond is
this no man ever did figure that out for himself A man sees folks die
and as far as his senses go they dont live again But somehow he knows
they do and his knowledge comes from somewhere else its inspired

Thats wat I say Jombateeste hastened to interpose Got it from the
Ebrew Feel it in is bone

Out under the stars Jackson and Westover silently mounted the hillside
together At one of the thankyoumarms in the road the sick man stopped
like a weary horse to breathe He took off his hat and wiped the sweat
of weakness that had gathered upon his forehead and looked round the
sky powdered with the constellations and the planets Its sightly he
whispered

Yes it is fine Westover assented But the stars of our Northern
nights are nothing to what youll see in Egypt

Jackson repeated vaguely Egypt Where I should like to go is Mars He
fixed his eyes on the flaming planets in a long stare But I suppose
they have their own troubles same as we do They must get sick and die
like the rest of us But I should like to know more about em You
believe its inhabited dont you

Westovers agnosticism did not somehow extend to Mars Yes Ive no
doubt of it

Jackson seemed pleased Ive read everything I can lay my hands on about
it Ive got a notion that if theres any choosin after we get through
here I should like to go to Mars for a while or as long as I was a
little homesick still and wanted to keep as near the earth as I could
he added quaintly

Westover laughed You could study up the subject of irrigation there
they say thats what keeps the parallel markings green on Mars and
telegraph a few hints to your brother in Colorado after the Martians
perfect their signal code

Perhaps the invalids fancy flagged He drew a long ragged breath I
dont know as I care to leave home much If it want a kind of duty I
shouldnt He seemed impelled by a sudden need to say How do you think
Jefferson and mother will make it out together

Ive no doubt theyll manage said Westover

Theyre a good deal alike Jackson suggested

Westover preferred not to meet his overture Youll be back you know
almost as soon as the season commences next summer

Yes Jackson assented more cheerfully And now Cynthys sure to be
here

Yes she will be here said Westover not so cheerfully

Jackson seemed to find the opening he was seeking in Westovers tone
What do you think of gettin married anyway Mr Westover he asked

We havent either of us thought so well of it as to try it Jackson
said the painter jocosely

Think its a kind of chance

Its a chance

Jackson was silent Then I ant one of them he said abruptly that
think a mans goin to be made over by marryin this woman or that If he
ant goin to be the right kind of a man himself he ant because his
wifes a good woman Sometimes I think that a mans wife is the last
person in the world that can change his disposition She can influence
him about this and about that but she cant change him It seems as if
he couldnt let her if he tried and after the first startoff he dont
try

Thats true Westover assented Were terribly inflexible Nothing but
something like a change of heart as they used to call it can make us
different and even then were apt to go back to our old shape When you
look at it in that light marriage seems impossible Yet it takes place
every day

Its a great risk for a woman said Jackson putting on his hat and
stirring for an onward movement But I presume that if the man is honest
with her its the best thing she can have The great trouble is for the
man to be honest with her

Honesty is difficult said Westover

He made Jackson promise to spend a day with him in Boston on his way to
take the Mediterranean steamer at New York When they met he yielded to
an impulse which the invalids forlornness inspired and went on to see
him off He was glad that he did that for though Jackson was not sad at
parting he was visibly touched by Westovers kindness

Of course he talked away from it I guess Ive left em in pretty good
shape for the winter at Lions Head he said Ive got Whitwell to
agree to come up and live in the house with mother and shell have
Cynthy with her anyway and Frank and Jombateeste can look after the
bosses easy enough

He had said something like this before but Westover could see that it
comforted him to repeat it and he encouraged him to do so in full He
made him talk about getting home in the spring after the frost was out
of the ground but he questioned involuntarily while the sick man spoke
whether he might not then be lying under the sands that had never known a
frost since the glacial epoch When the last warning for visitors to go
ashore came Jackson said with a wan smile while he held Westovers
hand I shant forget this very soon

Write to me said Westover
