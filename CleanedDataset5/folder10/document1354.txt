I The Hurrying of Ludovic


Anne Shirley was curled up on the windowseat of Theodora Dixs
sittingroom one Saturday evening looking dreamily afar at some fair
starland beyond the hills of sunset Anne was visiting for a fortnight
of her vacation at Echo Lodge where Mr and Mrs Stephen Irving were
spending the summer and she often ran over to the old Dix homestead
to chat for awhile with Theodora They had had their chat out on this
particular evening and Anne was giving herself over to the delight of
building an aircastle She leaned her shapely head with its braided
coronet of dark red hair against the windowcasing and her gray eyes
were like the moonlight gleam of shadowy pools

Then she saw Ludovic Speed coming down the lane He was yet far from the
house for the Dix lane was a long one but Ludovic could be recognized
as far as he could be seen No one else in Middle Grafton had such a
tall gentlystooping placidlymoving figure In every kink and turn of
it there was an individuality all Ludovics own

Anne roused herself from her dreams thinking it would only be tactful
to take her departure Ludovic was courting Theodora Everyone in
Grafton knew that or if anyone were in ignorance of the fact it was
not because he had not had time to find out Ludovic had been coming
down that lane to see Theodora in the same ruminating unhastening
fashion for fifteen years

When Anne who was slim and girlish and romantic rose to go Theodora
who was plump and middleaged and practical said with a twinkle in her
eye

There isnt any hurry child Sit down and have your call out Youve
seen Ludovic coming down the lane and I suppose you think youll be a
crowd But you wont Ludovic rather likes a third person around and
so do I It spurs up the conversation as it were When a man has been
coming to see you straight along twice a week for fifteen years you
get rather talked out by spells

Theodora never pretended to bashfulness where Ludovic was concerned
She was not at all shy of referring to him and his dilatory courtship
Indeed it seemed to amuse her

Anne sat down again and together they watched Ludovic coming down the
lane gazing calmly about him at the lush clover fields and the blue
loops of the river winding in and out of the misty valley below

Anne looked at Theodoras placid finelymoulded face and tried to
imagine what she herself would feel like if she were sitting there
waiting for an elderly lover who had seemingly taken so long to make
up his mind But even Annes imagination failed her for this

Anyway she thought impatiently if I wanted him I think Id find
some way of hurrying him up Ludovic SPEED Was there ever such a misfit
of a name Such a name for such a man is a delusion and a snare

Presently Ludovic got to the house but stood so long on the doorstep
in a brown study gazing into the tangled green boskage of the cherry
orchard that Theodora finally went and opened the door before he
knocked As she brought him into the sittingroom she made a comical
grimace at Anne over his shoulder

Ludovic smiled pleasantly at Anne He liked her she was the only young
girl he knew for he generally avoided young girlsthey made him feel
awkward and out of place But Anne did not affect him in this fashion
She had a way of getting on with all sorts of people and although they
had not known her very long both Ludovic and Theodora looked upon her
as an old friend

Ludovic was tall and somewhat ungainly but his unhesitating placidity
gave him the appearance of a dignity that did not otherwise pertain to
him He had a drooping silky brown moustache and a little curly tuft
of imperiala fashion which was regarded as eccentric in Grafton
where men had cleanshaven chins or went fullbearded His eyes were
dreamy and pleasant with a touch of melancholy in their blue depths

He sat down in the big bulgy old armchair that had belonged to
Theodoras father Ludovic always sat there and Anne declared that the
chair had come to look like him

The conversation soon grew animated enough Ludovic was a good talker
when he had somebody to draw him out He was well read and frequently
surprised Anne by his shrewd comments on men and matters out in the
world of which only the faint echoes reached Deland River He had also
a liking for religious arguments with Theodora who did not care much
for politics or the making of history but was avid of doctrines and
read everything pertaining thereto When the conversation drifted
into an eddy of friendly wrangling between Ludovic and Theodora over
Christian Science Anne understood that her usefulness was ended for the
time being and that she would not be missed

Its star time and goodnight time she said and went away quietly

But she had to stop to laugh when she was well out of sight of the
house in a green meadow bestarred with the white and gold of daisies
A wind odourfreighted blew daintily across it Anne leaned against a
white birch tree in the corner and laughed heartily as she was apt to
do whenever she thought of Ludovic and Theodora To her eager youth
this courtship of theirs seemed a very amusing thing She liked Ludovic
but allowed herself to be provoked with him

The dear big irritating goose she said aloud There never was such
a lovable idiot before Hes just like the alligator in the old rhyme
who wouldnt go along and wouldnt keep still but just kept bobbing up
and down

Two evenings later when Anne went over to the Dix place she and
Theodora drifted into a conversation about Ludovic Theodora who was
the most industrious soul alive and had a mania for fancy work into
the bargain was busying her smooth plump fingers with a very elaborate
Battenburg lace centrepiece Anne was lying back in a little rocker
with her slim hands folded in her lap watching Theodora She realized
that Theodora was very handsome in a stately Junolike fashion of
firm white flesh large clearlychiselled outlines and great cowey
brown eyes When Theodora was not smiling she looked very imposing
Anne thought it likely that Ludovic held her in awe

Did you and Ludovic talk about Christian Science ALL Saturday evening
she asked

Theodora overflowed into a smile

Yes and we even quarrelled over it At least _I_ did Ludovic wouldnt
quarrel with anyone You have to fight air when you spar with him I
hate to square up to a person who wont hit back

Theodora said Anne coaxingly I am going to be curious and
impertinent You can snub me if you like Why dont you and Ludovic get
married

Theodora laughed comfortably

Thats the question Grafton folks have been asking for quite a while
I reckon Anne Well Id have no objection to marrying Ludovic Thats
frank enough for you isnt it But its not easy to marry a man unless
he asks you And Ludovic has never asked me

Is he too shy persisted Anne Since Theodora was in the mood she
meant to sift this puzzling affair to the bottom

Theodora dropped her work and looked meditatively out over the green
slopes of the summer world

No I dont think it is that Ludovic isnt shy Its just his waythe
Speed way The Speeds are all dreadfully deliberate They spend
years thinking over a thing before they make up their minds to do it
Sometimes they get so much in the habit of thinking about it that they
never get over itlike old Alder Speed who was always talking of
going to England to see his brother but never went though there was
no earthly reason why he shouldnt Theyre not lazy you know but they
love to take their time

And Ludovic is just an aggravated case of Speedism suggested Anne

Exactly He never hurried in his life Why he has been thinking for
the last six years of getting his house painted He talks it over with
me every little while and picks out the colour and there the matter
stays Hes fond of me and he means to ask me to have him sometime The
only question iswill the time ever come

Why dont you hurry him up asked Anne impatiently

Theodora went back to her stitches with another laugh

If Ludovic could be hurried up Im not the one to do it Im too shy
It sounds ridiculous to hear a woman of my age and inches say that but
it is true Of course I know its the only way any Speed ever did make
out to get married For instance theres a cousin of mine married to
Ludovics brother I dont say she proposed to him out and out but
mind you Anne it wasnt far from it I couldnt do anything like that
I DID try once When I realized that I was getting sere and mellow and
all the girls of my generation were going off on either hand I tried to
give Ludovic a hint But it stuck in my throat And now I dont mind If
I dont change Dix to Speed until I take the initiative it will be Dix
to the end of life Ludovic doesnt realize that we are growing old you
know He thinks we are giddy young folks yet with plenty of time before
us Thats the Speed failing They never find out theyre alive until
theyre dead

Youre fond of Ludovic arent you asked Anne detecting a note of
real bitterness among Theodoras paradoxes

Laws yes said Theodora candidly She did not think it worth while to
blush over so settled a fact I think the world and all of Ludovic And
he certainly does need somebody to look after HIM Hes neglectedhe
looks frayed You can see that for yourself That old aunt of his looks
after his house in some fashion but she doesnt look after him And
hes coming now to the age when a man needs to be looked after and
coddled a bit Im lonesome here and Ludovic is lonesome up there
and it does seem ridiculous doesnt it I dont wonder that were the
standing joke of Grafton Goodness knows I laugh at it enough myself
Ive sometimes thought that if Ludovic could be made jealous it might
spur him along But I never could flirt and theres nobody to flirt with
if I could Everybody hereabouts looks upon me as Ludovics property and
nobody would dream of interfering with him

Theodora cried Anne I have a plan

Now what are you going to do exclaimed Theodora

Anne told her At first Theodora laughed and protested In the end she
yielded somewhat doubtfully overborne by Annes enthusiasm

Well try it then she said resignedly If Ludovic gets mad and
leaves me Ill be worse off than ever But nothing venture nothing
win And there is a fighting chance I suppose Besides I must admit
Im tired of his dillydallying

Anne went back to Echo Lodge tingling with delight in her plot She
hunted up Arnold Sherman and told him what was required of him Arnold
Sherman listened and laughed He was an elderly widower an intimate
friend of Stephen Irving and had come down to spend part of the summer
with him and his wife in Prince Edward Island He was handsome in a
mature style and he had a dash of mischief in him still so that he
entered readily enough into Annes plan It amused him to think of
hurrying Ludovic Speed and he knew that Theodora Dix could be depended
on to do her part The comedy would not be dull whatever its outcome

The curtain rose on the first act after prayer meeting on the next
Thursday night It was bright moonlight when the people came out of
church and everybody saw it plainly Arnold Sherman stood upon the
steps close to the door and Ludovic Speed leaned up against a corner of
the graveyard fence as he had done for years The boys said he had worn
the paint off that particular place Ludovic knew of no reason why he
should paste himself up against the church door Theodora would come out
as usual and he would join her as she went past the corner

This was what happened Theodora came down the steps her stately figure
outlined in its darkness against the gush of lamplight from the porch
Arnold Sherman asked her if he might see her home Theodora took his arm
calmly and together they swept past the stupefied Ludovic who stood
helplessly gazing after them as if unable to believe his eyes

For a few moments he stood there limply then he started down the road
after his fickle lady and her new admirer The boys and irresponsible
young men crowded after expecting some excitement but they were
disappointed Ludovic strode on until he overtook Theodora and Arnold
Sherman and then fell meekly in behind them

Theodora hardly enjoyed her walk home although Arnold Sherman laid
himself out to be especially entertaining Her heart yearned after
Ludovic whose shuffling footsteps she heard behind her She feared that
she had been very cruel but she was in for it now She steeled herself
by the reflection that it was all for his own good and she talked to
Arnold Sherman as if he were the one man in the world Poor deserted
Ludovic following humbly behind heard her and if Theodora had known
how bitter the cup she was holding to his lips really was she would
never have been resolute enough to present it no matter for what
ultimate good

When she and Arnold turned in at her gate Ludovic had to stop Theodora
looked over her shoulder and saw him standing still on the road His
forlorn figure haunted her thoughts all night If Anne had not run over
the next day and bolstered up her convictions she might have spoiled
everything by prematurely relenting

Ludovic meanwhile stood still on the road quite oblivious to the
hoots and comments of the vastly amused small boy contingent until
Theodora and his rival disappeared from his view under the firs in the
hollow of her lane Then he turned about and went home not with his
usual leisurely amble but with a perturbed stride which proclaimed his
inward disquiet

He felt bewildered If the world had come suddenly to an end or if the
lazy meandering Grafton River had turned about and flowed up hill
Ludovic could not have been more astonished For fifteen years he had
walked home from meetings with Theodora and now this elderly stranger
with all the glamour of the States hanging about him had coolly
walked off with her under Ludovics very nose Worsemost unkindest
cut of allTheodora had gone with him willingly nay she had evidently
enjoyed his company Ludovic felt the stirring of a righteous anger in
his easygoing soul

When he reached the end of his lane he paused at his gate and looked
at his house set back from the lane in a crescent of birches Even in
the moonlight its weatherworn aspect was plainly visible He thought
of the palatial residence rumour ascribed to Arnold Sherman in Boston
and stroked his chin nervously with his sunburnt fingers Then he
doubled up his fist and struck it smartly on the gatepost

Theodora neednt think she is going to jilt me in this fashion
after keeping company with me for fifteen years he said ILL
have something to say to it Arnold Sherman or no Arnold Sherman The
impudence of the puppy

The next morning Ludovic drove to Carmody and engaged Joshua Pye to
come and paint his house and that evening although he was not due till
Saturday night he went down to see Theodora

Arnold Sherman was there before him and was actually sitting in
Ludovics own prescriptive chair Ludovic had to deposit himself in
Theodoras new wicker rocker where he looked and felt lamentably out of
place

If Theodora felt the situation to be awkward she carried it off
superbly She had never looked handsomer and Ludovic perceived that she
wore her second best silk dress He wondered miserably if she had donned
it in expectation of his rivals call She had never put on silk dresses
for him Ludovic had always been the meekest and mildest of mortals but
he felt quite murderous as he sat mutely there and listened to Arnold
Shermans polished conversation

You should just have been here to see him glowering Theodora told the
delighted Anne the next day It may be wicked of me but I felt real
glad I was afraid he might stay away and sulk So long as he comes here
and sulks I dont worry But he is feeling badly enough poor soul and
Im really eaten up by remorse He tried to outstay Mr Sherman last
night but he didnt manage it You never saw a more depressedlooking
creature than he was as he hurried down the lane Yes he actually
hurried

The following Sunday evening Arnold Sherman walked to church with
Theodora and sat with her When they came in Ludovic Speed suddenly
stood up in his pew under the gallery He sat down again at once but
everybody in view had seen him and that night folks in all the length
and breadth of Grafton River discussed the dramatic occurrence with keen
enjoyment

Yes he jumped right up as if he was pulled on his feet while the
minister was reading the chapter said his cousin Lorella Speed who
had been in church to her sister who had not His face was as white
as a sheet and his eyes were just glaring out of his head I never felt
so thrilled I declare I almost expected him to fly at them then and
there But he just gave a sort of gasp and set down again I dont know
whether Theodora Dix saw him or not She looked as cool and unconcerned
as you please

Theodora had not seen Ludovic but if she looked cool and unconcerned
her appearance belied her for she felt miserably flustered She could
not prevent Arnold Sherman coming to church with her but it seemed to
her like going too far People did not go to church and sit together in
Grafton unless they were the next thing to being engaged What if this
filled Ludovic with the narcotic of despair instead of wakening him
up She sat through the service in misery and heard not one word of the
sermon

But Ludovics spectacular performances were not yet over The Speeds
might be hard to get started but once they were started their momentum
was irresistible When Theodora and Mr Sherman came out Ludovic was
waiting on the steps He stood up straight and stern with his head
thrown back and his shoulders squared There was open defiance in the
look he cast on his rival and masterfulness in the mere touch of the
hand he laid on Theodoras arm

May I see you home Miss Dix his words said His tone said I am
going to see you home whether or no

Theodora with a deprecating look at Arnold Sherman took his arm
and Ludovic marched her across the green amid a silence which the very
horses tied to the storm fence seemed to share For Ludovic twas a
crowded hour of glorious life

Anne walked all the way over from Avonlea the next day to hear the news
Theodora smiled consciously

Yes it is really settled at last Anne Coming home last night Ludovic
asked me plump and plain to marry himSunday and all as it was
Its to be right awayfor Ludovic wont be put off a week longer than
necessary

So Ludovic Speed has been hurried up to some purpose at last said Mr
Sherman when Anne called in at Echo Lodge brimful with her news And
you are delighted of course and my poor pride must be the scapegoat I
shall always be remembered in Grafton as the man from Boston who wanted
Theodora Dix and couldnt get her

But that wont be true you know said Anne comfortingly

Arnold Sherman thought of Theodoras ripe beauty and the mellow
companionableness she had revealed in their brief intercourse

Im not perfectly sure of that he said with a half sigh





II Old Lady Lloyd


I The May Chapter


Spencervale gossip always said that Old Lady Lloyd was rich and mean
and proud Gossip as usual was onethird right and twothirds wrong
Old Lady Lloyd was neither rich nor mean in reality she was pitifully
poorso poor that Crooked Jack Spencer who dug her garden and
chopped her wood for her was opulent by contrast for he at least
never lacked three meals a day and the Old Lady could sometimes achieve
no more than one But she WAS very proudso proud that she would have
died rather than let the Spencervale people among whom she had queened
it in her youth suspect how poor she was and to what straits was
sometimes reduced She much preferred to have them think her miserly and
odda queer old recluse who never went anywhere even to church and
who paid the smallest subscription to the ministers salary of anyone in
the congregation

And her just rolling in wealth they said indignantly Well she
didnt get her miserly ways from her parents THEY were real generous
and neighbourly There never was a finer gentleman than old Doctor
Lloyd He was always doing kindnesses to everybody and he had a way of
doing them that made you feel as if you was doing the favour not him
Well well let Old Lady Lloyd keep herself and her money to herself
if she wants to If she doesnt want our company she doesnt have to
suffer it thats all Reckon she isnt none too happy for all her money
and pride

No the Old Lady was none too happy that was unfortunately true It
is not easy to be happy when your life is eaten up with loneliness and
emptiness on the spiritual side and when on the material side all you
have between you and starvation is the little money your hens bring you
in

The Old Lady lived away back at the old Lloyd place as it was always
called It was a quaint loweaved house with big chimneys and square
windows and with spruces growing thickly all around it The Old Lady
lived there all alone and there were weeks at a time when she never saw
a human being except Crooked Jack What the Old Lady did with herself
and how she put in her time was a puzzle the Spencervale people could
not solve The children believed she amused herself counting the gold in
the big black box under her bed Spencervale children held the Old Lady
in mortal terror some of themthe Spencer Road frybelieved she
was a witch all of them would run if when wandering about the woods
in search of berries or spruce gum they saw at a distance the spare
upright form of the Old Lady gathering sticks for her fire Mary Moore
was the only one who was quite sure she was not a witch

Witches are always ugly she said decisively and Old Lady Lloyd
isnt ugly Shes real prettyshes got such a soft white hair and big
black eyes and a little white face Those Road children dont know what
theyre talking of Mother says theyre a very ignorant crowd

Well she doesnt ever go to church and she mutters and talks to
herself all the time shes picking up sticks maintained Jimmy Kimball
stoutly

The Old Lady talked to herself because she was really very fond of
company and conversation To be sure when you have talked to nobody but
yourself for nearly twenty years it is apt to grow somewhat monotonous
and there were times when the Old Lady would have sacrificed everything
but her pride for a little human companionship At such times she felt
very bitter and resentful toward Fate for having taken everything
from her She had nothing to love and that is about as unwholesome a
condition as is possible to anyone

It was always hardest in the spring Once upon a time the Old Ladywhen
she had not been the Old Lady but pretty wilful highspirited
Margaret Lloydhad loved springs now she hated them because they hurt
her and this particular spring of this particular May chapter hurt her
more than any that had gone before The Old Lady felt as if she could
NOT endure the ache of it Everything hurt herthe new green tips on
the firs the fairy mists down in the little beech hollow below the
house the fresh smell of the red earth Crooked Jack spaded up in her
garden The Old Lady lay awake all one moonlit night and cried for very
heartache She even forgot her body hunger in her soul hunger and the
Old Lady had been hungry more or less all that week She was living on
store biscuits and water so that she might be able to pay Crooked Jack
for digging her garden When the pale lovely dawncolour came stealing
up the sky behind the spruces the Old Lady buried her face in her
pillow and refused to look at it

I hate the new day she said rebelliously It will be just like all
the other hard common days I dont want to get up and live it And
oh to think that long ago I reached out my hands joyfully to every
new day as to a friend who was bringing me good tidings I loved the
mornings thensunny or gray they were as delightful as an unread
bookand now I hate themhate themhate them

But the Old Lady got up nevertheless for she knew Crooked Jack would
be coming early to finish the garden She arranged her beautiful thick
white hair very carefully and put on her purple silk dress with the
little gold spots in it The Old Lady always wore silk from motives of
economy It was much cheaper to wear a silk dress that had belonged to
her mother than to buy new print at the store The Old Lady had plenty
of silk dresses which had belonged to her mother She wore them morning
noon and night and Spencervale people considered it an additional
evidence of her pride As for the fashion of them it was of course
just because she was too mean to have them made over They did not dream
that the Old Lady never put on one of the silk dresses without agonizing
over its unfashionableness and that even the eyes of Crooked Jack cast
on her antique flounces and overskirts was almost more than her feminine
vanity could endure

In spite of the fact that the Old Lady had not welcomed the new day its
beauty charmed her when she went out for a walk after her dinneror
rather after her midday biscuit It was so fresh so sweet so virgin
and the spruce woods around the old Lloyd place were athrill with busy
spring doings and all sprinkled through with young lights and shadows
Some of their delight found its way into the Old Ladys bitter heart
as she wandered through them and when she came out at the little plank
bridge over the brook down under the beeches she felt almost gentle and
tender once more There was one big beech there in particular which
the Old Lady loved for reasons best known to herselfa great tall
beech with a trunk like the shaft of a gray marble column and a leafy
spread of branches over the still goldenbrown pool made beneath it by
the brook It had been a young sapling in the days that were haloed by
the vanished glory of the Old Ladys life

The Old Lady heard childish voices and laughter afar up the lane which
led to William Spencers place just above the woods William Spencers
front lane ran out to the main road in a different direction but this
back lane furnished a short cut and his children always went to school
that way

The Old Lady shrank hastily back behind a clump of young spruces She
did not like the Spencer children because they always seemed so afraid
of her Through the spruce screen she could see them coming gaily down
the lanethe two older ones in front the twins behind clinging to the
hands of a tall slim young girlthe new music teacher probably The
Old Lady had heard from the egg pedlar that she was going to board at
William Spencers but she had not heard her name

She looked at her with some curiosity as they drew nearand then all
at once the Old Ladys heart gave a great bound and began to beat as it
had not beaten for years while her breath came quickly and she trembled
violently WhoWHO could this girl be

Under the new music teachers straw hat were masses of fine chestnut
hair of the very shade and wave that the Old Lady remembered on another
head in vanished years from under those waves looked large violetblue
eyes with very black lashes and browsand the Old Lady knew those eyes
as well as she knew her own and the new music teachers face with all
its beauty of delicate outline and dainty colouring and glad buoyant
youth was a face from the Old Ladys pasta perfect resemblance in
every respect save one the face which the Old Lady remembered had
been weak with all its charm but this girls face possessed a fine
dominant strength compact of sweetness and womanliness As she passed by
the Old Ladys hiding place she laughed at something one of the children
said and oh but the Old Lady knew that laughter well She had heard it
before under that very beech tree

She watched them until they disappeared over the wooded hill beyond the
bridge and then she went back home as if she walked in a dream Crooked
Jack was delving vigorously in the garden ordinarily the Old Lady
did not talk much with Crooked Jack for she disliked his weakness for
gossip but now she went into the garden a stately old figure in her
purple goldspotted silk with the sunshine gleaming on her white hair

Crooked Jack had seen her go out and had remarked to himself that the
Old Lady was losing ground she was pale and peakedlooking He now
concluded that he had been mistaken The Old Ladys cheeks were pink and
her eyes shining Somewhere in her walk she had shed ten years at least
Crooked Jack leaned on his spade and decided that there werent many
finer looking women anywhere than Old Lady Lloyd Pity she was such an
old miser

Mr Spencer said the Old Lady graciouslyshe always spoke very
graciously to her inferiors when she talked to them at allcan you
tell me the name of the new music teacher who is boarding at Mr William
Spencers

Sylvia Gray said Crooked Jack

The Old Ladys heart gave another great bound But she had known itshe
had known that girl with Leslie Grays hair and eyes and laugh must be
Leslie Grays daughter

Crooked Jack spat on his hand and resumed his work but his tongue went
faster than his spade and the Old Lady listened greedily For the first
time she enjoyed and blessed Crooked Jacks garrulity and gossip Every
word he uttered was as an apple of gold in a picture of silver to her

He had been working at William Spencers the day the new music teacher
had come and what Crooked Jack couldnt find out about any person in
one whole dayat least as far as outward life wentwas hardly worth
finding out Next to discovering things did he love telling them and it
would be hard to say which enjoyed that ensuing halfhour moreCrooked
Jack or the Old Lady

Crooked Jacks account boiled down amounted to this both Miss Grays
parents had died when she was a baby she had been brought up by an
aunt she was very poor and very ambitious

Wants a moosical eddication finished up Crooked Jack and by jingo
she orter have it for anything like the voice of her I never heerd
She sung for us that evening after supper and I thought twas an angel
singing It just went through me like a shaft o light The Spencer
young ones are crazy over her already Shes got twenty pupils around
here and in Grafton and Avonlea

When the Old Lady had found out everything Crooked Jack could tell
her she went into the house and sat down by the window of her little
sittingroom to think it all over She was tingling from head to foot
with excitement

Leslies daughter This Old Lady had had her romance once Long
agoforty years agoshe had been engaged to Leslie Gray a young
college student who taught in Spencervale for the summer term one
yearthe golden summer of Margaret Lloyds life Leslie had been a
shy dreamy handsome fellow with literary ambitions which as he and
Margaret both firmly believed would one day bring him fame and fortune

Then there had been a foolish bitter quarrel at the end of that golden
summer Leslie had gone away in anger afterwards he had written but
Margaret Lloyd still in the grasp of her pride and resentment had sent
a harsh answer No more letters came Leslie Gray never returned and
one day Margaret wakened to the realization that she had put love out of
her life for ever She knew it would never be hers again and from that
moment her feet were turned from youth to walk down the valley of shadow
to a lonely eccentric age

Many years later she heard of Leslies marriage then came news of his
death after a life that had not fulfilled his dreams for him Nothing
more she had heard or knownnothing to this day when she had seen his
daughter pass her by unseeing in the beech hollow

His daughter And she might have been MY daughter murmured the Old
Lady Oh if I could only know her and love herand perhaps win her
love in return But I cannot I could not have Leslie Grays daughter
know how poor I amhow low I have been brought I could not bear that
And to think she is living so near me the darlingjust up the lane
and over the hill I can see her go by every dayI can have that dear
pleasure at least But oh if I could only do something for hergive
her some little pleasure It would be such a delight

When the Old Lady happened to go into her spare room that evening she
saw from it a light shining through a gap in the trees on the hill She
knew that it shone from the Spencers spare room So it was Sylvias
light The Old Lady stood in the darkness and watched it until it went
outwatched it with a great sweetness breathing in her heart such as
risen from old roseleaves when they are stirred She fancied Sylvia
moving about her room brushing and braiding her long glistening
hairlaying aside her little trinkets and girlish adornmentsmaking
her simple preparations for sleep When the light went out the Old
Lady pictured a slight white figure kneeling by the window in the soft
starshine and the Old Lady knelt down then and there and said her own
prayers in fellowship She said the simple form of words she had always
used but a new spirit seemed to inspire them and she finished with
a new petitionLet me think of something I can do for her dear
Fathersome little little thing that I can do for her

The Old Lady had slept in the same room all her lifethe one looking
north into the sprucesand loved it but the next day she moved into
the spare room without a regret It was to be her room after this she
must be where she could see Sylvias light she put the bed where she
could lie in it and look at that earth star which had suddenly shone
across the twilight shadows of her heart She felt very happy she
had not felt happy for many years but now a strange new dreamlike
interest remote from the harsh realities of her existence but none the
less comforting and alluring had entered into her life Besides she
had thought of something she could do for Sylviaa little little
thing that might give her pleasure

Spencervale people were wont to say regretfully that there were no
Mayflowers in Spencervale the Spencervale young fry when they wanted
Mayflowers thought they had to go over to the barrens at Avonlea six
miles away for them Old Lady Lloyd knew better In her many long
solitary rambles she had discovered a little clearing far back in the
woodsa southwardsloping sandy hill on a tract of woodland belonging
to a man who lived in townwhich in spring was starred over with the
pink and white of arbutus

To this clearing the Old Lady betook herself that afternoon walking
through wood lanes and under dim spruce arches like a woman with a glad
purpose All at once the spring was dear and beautiful to her once more
for love had entered again into her heart and her starved soul was
feasting on its divine nourishment

Old Lady Lloyd found a wealth of Mayflowers on the sandy hill She
filled her basket with them gloating over the loveliness which was to
give pleasure to Sylvia When she got home she wrote on a slip of paper
For Sylvia It was not likely anyone in Spencervale would know her
handwriting but to make sure she disguised it writing in round big
letters like a childs She carried her Mayflowers down to the hollow
and heaped them in a recess between the big roots of the old beech with
the little note thrust through a stem on top

Then the Old Lady deliberately hid behind the spruce clump She had put
on her dark green silk on purpose for hiding She had not long to
wait Soon Sylvia Gray came down the hill with Mattie Spencer When she
reached the bridge she saw the Mayflowers and gave an exclamation of
delight Then she saw her name and her expression changed to wonder
The Old Lady peering through the boughs could have laughed for very
pleasure over the success of her little plot

For me said Sylvia lifting the flowers CAN they really be for me
Mattie Who could have left them here

Mattie giggled

I believe it was Chris Stewart she said I know he was over at
Avonlea last night And ma says hes taken a notion to youshe knows
by the way he looked at you when you were singing night before last It
would be just like him to do something queer like thishes such a shy
fellow with the girls

Sylvia frowned a little She did not like Matties expressions but
she did like Mayflowers and she did not dislike Chris Stewart who had
seemed to her merely a nice modest country boy She lifted the flowers
and buried her face in them

Anyway Im much obliged to the giver whoever he or she is she said
merrily Theres nothing I love like Mayflowers Oh how sweet they
are

When they had passed the Old Lady emerged from her lurking place
flushed with triumph It did not vex her that Sylvia should think Chris
Stewart had given her the flowers nay it was all the better since she
would be the less likely to suspect the real donor The main thing was
that Sylvia should have the delight of them That quite satisfied the
Old Lady who went back to her lonely house with the cockles of her
heart all in a glow

It soon was a matter of gossip in Spencervale that Chris Stewart was
leaving Mayflowers at the beech hollow for the music teacher every other
day Chris himself denied it but he was not believed Firstly there
were no Mayflowers in Spencervale secondly Chris had to go to Carmody
every other day to haul milk to the butter factory and Mayflowers grew
in Carmody and thirdly the Stewarts always had a romantic streak in
them Was not that enough circumstantial evidence for anybody

As for Sylvia she did not mind if Chris had a boyish admiration for
her and expressed it thus delicately She thought it very nice of him
indeed when he did not vex her with any other advances and she was
quite content to enjoy his Mayflowers

Old Lady Lloyd heard all the gossip about it from the egg pedlar and
listened to him with laughter glimmering far down in her eyes The egg
pedlar went away and vowed hed never seen the Old Lady so spry as she
was this spring she seemed real interested in the young folks doings

The Old Lady kept her secret and grew young in it She walked back to
the Mayflower hill as long as the Mayflowers lasted and she always hid
in the spruces to see Sylvia Gray go by Every day she loved her more
and yearned after her more deeply All the long repressed tenderness of
her nature overflowed to this girl who was unconscious of it She was
proud of Sylvias grace and beauty and sweetness of voice and laughter
She began to like the Spencer children because they worshipped Sylvia
she envied Mrs Spencer because the latter could minister to Sylvias
needs Even the egg pedlar seemed a delightful person because he brought
news of Sylviaher social popularity her professional success the
love and admiration she had won already

The Old Lady never dreamed of revealing herself to Sylvia That in her
poverty was not to be thought of for a moment It would have been very
sweet to know hersweet to have her come to the old housesweet to
talk to herto enter into her life But it might not be The Old Ladys
pride was still far stronger than her love It was the one thing she had
never sacrificed and neverso she believedcould sacrifice



II The June Chapter


There were no Mayflowers in June but now the Old Ladys garden was
full of blossoms and every morning Sylvia found a bouquet of them by the
beechthe perfumed ivory of white narcissus the flame of tulips the
fairy branches of bleedingheart the pinkandsnow of little
thorny single sweetbreathed early roses The Old Lady had no fear of
discovery for the flowers that grew in her garden grew in every other
Spencervale garden as well including the Stewart garden Chris Stewart
when he was teased about the music teacher merely smiled and held
his peace Chris knew perfectly well who was the real giver of those
flowers He had made it his business to find out when the Mayflower
gossip started But since it was evident Old Lady Lloyd did not wish it
to be known Chris told no one Chris had always liked Old Lady Lloyd
ever since the day ten years before when she had found him crying in
the woods with a cut foot and had taken him into her house and bathed
and bound the wound and given him ten cents to buy candy at the store
The Old Lady went without supper that night because of it but Chris
never knew that

The Old Lady thought it a most beautiful June She no longer hated the
new days on the contrary she welcomed them

Every day is an uncommon day now she said jubilantly to herselffor
did not almost every day bring her a glimpse of Sylvia Even on rainy
days the Old Lady gallantly braved rheumatism to hide behind her clump
of dripping spruces and watch Sylvia pass The only days she could not
see her were Sundays and no Sundays had ever seemed so long to Old Lady
Lloyd as those June Sundays did

One day the egg pedlar had news for her

The music teacher is going to sing a solo for a collection piece
tomorrow he told her

The Old Ladys black eyes flashed with interest

I didnt know Miss Gray was a member of the choir she said

Jined two Sundays ago I tell you our music is something worth
listening to now The churchll be packed tomorrow I reckonher
names gone all over the country for singing You ought to come and hear
it Miss Lloyd

The pedlar said this out of bravado merely to show he wasnt scared of
the Old Lady for all her grand airs The Old Lady made no answer and
he thought he had offended her He went away wishing he hadnt said it
Had he but known it the Old Lady had forgotten the existence of all and
any egg pedlars He had blotted himself and his insignificance out of
her consciousness by his last sentence All her thoughts feelings and
wishes were submerged in a very whirlpool of desire to hear Sylvia sing
that solo She went into the house in a tumult and tried to conquer that
desire She could not do it even thought she summoned all her pride to
her aid Pride said

You will have to go to church to hear her You havent fit clothes to
go to church in Think what a figure you will make before them all

But for the first time a more insistent voice than pride spoke to her
souland for the first time the Old Lady listened to it It was too
true that she had never gone to church since the day on which she had
to begin wearing her mothers silk dresses The Old Lady herself thought
that this was very wicked and she tried to atone by keeping Sunday very
strictly and always having a little service of her own morning and
evening She sang three hymns in her cracked voice prayed aloud and
read a sermon But she could not bring herself to go to church in her
outofdate clothesshe who had once set the fashions in Spencervale
and the longer she stayed away the more impossible it seemed that she
should ever again go Now the impossible had become not only possible
but insistent She must go to church and hear Sylvia sing no matter how
ridiculous she appeared no matter how people talked and laughed at her

Spencervale congregation had a mild sensation the next afternoon Just
before the opening of service Old Lady Lloyd walked up the aisle and sat
down in the longunoccupied Lloyd pew in front of the pulpit

The Old Ladys very soul was writhing within her She recalled the
reflection she had seen in her mirror before she leftthe old black
silk in the mode of thirty years agone and the queer little bonnet of
shirred black satin She thought how absurd she must look in the eyes of
her world

As a matter of fact she did not look in the least absurd Some women
might have but the Old Ladys stately distinction of carriage and
figure was so subtly commanding that it did away with the consideration
of garmenting altogether

The Old Lady did not know this But she did know that Mrs Kimball
the storekeepers wife presently rustled into the next pew in the very
latest fashion of fabric and mode she and Mrs Kimball were the same
age and there had been a time when the latter had been content
to imitate Margaret Lloyds costumes at a humble distance But the
storekeeper had proposed and things were changed now and there sat
poor Old Lady Lloyd feeling the change bitterly and half wishing she
had not come to church at all

Then all at once the Angel of Love touched these foolish thoughts born
of vanity and morbid pride and they melted away as if they had never
been Sylvia Gray had come into the choir and was sitting just where
the afternoon sunshine fell over her beautiful hair like a halo The Old
Lady looked at her in a rapture of satisfied longing and thenceforth the
service was blessed to her as anything is blessed which comes through
the medium of unselfish love whether human or divine Nay are they not
one and the same differing in degree only not in kind

The Old Lady had never had such a good satisfying look at Sylvia
before All her former glimpses had been stolen and fleeting Now
she sat and gazed upon her to her hungry hearts content lingering
delightedly over every little charm and lovelinessthe way Sylvias
shining hair rippled back from her forehead the sweet little trick she
had of dropping quickly her longlashed eyelids when she encountered
too bold or curious a glance and the slender beautifully modelled
handsso like Leslie Grays handsthat held her hymn book She was
dressed very plainly in a black skirt and a white shirtwaist but none
of the other girls in the choir with all their fine feathers could
hold a candle to heras the egg pedlar said to his wife going home
from church

The Old Lady listened to the opening hymns with keen pleasure Sylvias
voice thrilled through and dominated them all But when the ushers got
up to take the collection an undercurrent of subdued excitement flowed
over the congregation Sylvia rose and came forward to Janet Moores
side at the organ The next moment her beautiful voice soared through
the building like the very soul of melodytrue clear powerful sweet
Nobody in Spencervale had ever listened to such a voice except Old
Lady Lloyd herself who in her youth had heard enough good singing to
enable her to be a tolerable judge of it She realized instantly that
this girl of her heart had a great gifta gift that would some day
bring her fame and fortune if it could be duly trained and developed

Oh Im so glad I came to church thought Old Lady Lloyd

When the solo was ended the Old Ladys conscience compelled her to drag
her eyes and thoughts from Sylvia and fasten them on the minister
who had been flattering himself all through the opening portion of the
service that Old Lady Lloyd had come to church on his account He was
newly settled having been in charge of the Spencervale congregation
only a few months he was a clever little fellow and he honestly thought
it was the fame of his preaching that had brought Old Lady Lloyd out to
church

When the service was over all the Old Ladys neighbours came to speak
to her with kindly smile and handshake They thought they ought to
encourage her now that she had made a start in the right direction the
Old Lady liked their cordiality and liked it none the less because she
detected in it the same unconscious respect and deference she had been
wont to receive in the old daysa respect and deference which her
personality compelled from all who approached her The Old Lady was
surprised to find that she could command it still in defiance of
unfashionable bonnet and ancient attire

Janet Moore and Sylvia Gray walked home from church together Did you
see Old Lady Lloyd out today asked Janet I was amazed when she
walked in She has never been to church in my recollection What a
quaint old figure she is Shes very rich you know but she wears her
mothers old clothes and never gets a new thing Some people think
she is mean but concluded Janet charitably I believe it is simply
eccentricity

I felt that was Miss Lloyd as soon as I saw her although I had never
seen her before said Sylvia dreamily I have been wishing to see
herfor a certain reason She has a very striking face I should like
to meet herto know her

I dont think its likely you ever will said Janet carelessly She
doesnt like young people and she never goes anywhere I dont think Id
like to know her Id be afraid of hershe has such stately ways and
such strange piercing eyes

_I_ shouldnt be afraid of her said Sylvia to herself as she turned
into the Spencer lane But I dont expect Ill ever become acquainted
with her If she knew who I am I suppose she would dislike me I suppose
she never suspects that I am Leslie Grays daughter

The minister thinking it well to strike while the iron was hot went up
to call on Old Lady Lloyd the very next afternoon He went in fear and
trembling for he had heard things about Old Lady Lloyd but she made
herself so agreeable in her highbred fashion that he was delighted
and told his wife when he went home that Spencervale people didnt
understand Miss Lloyd This was perfectly true but it is by no means
certain that the minister understood her either

He made only one mistake in tact but as the Old Lady did not snub him
for it he never knew he made it When he was leaving he said I hope
we shall see you at church next Sunday Miss Lloyd

Indeed you will said the Old Lady emphatically



III The July Chapter


The first day of July Sylvia found a little birch bark boat full of
strawberries at the beech in the hollow They were the earliest of the
season the Old Lady had found them in one of her secret haunts They
would have been a toothsome addition to the Old Ladys own slender bill
of fare but she never thought of eating them She got far more pleasure
out of the thought of Sylvias enjoying them for her tea Thereafter
the strawberries alternated with the flowers as long as they lasted and
then came blueberries and raspberries The blueberries grew far away and
the Old Lady had many a tramp after them Sometimes her bones ached at
night because of it but what cared the Old Lady for that Bone ache
is easier to endure than soul ache and the Old Ladys soul had stopped
aching for the first time in many year It was being nourished with
heavenly manna

One evening Crooked Jack came up to fix something that had gone wrong
with the Old Ladys well The Old Lady wandered affably out to him for
she knew he had been working at the Spencers all day and there might
be crumbs of information about Sylvia to be picked up

I reckon the music teachers feeling pretty blue this evening Crooked
Jack remarked after straining the Old Ladys patience to the last verge
of human endurance by expatiating on William Spencers new pump and
Mrs Spencers new washingmachine and Amelia Spencers new young man

Why asked the Old Lady turning very pale Had anything happened to
Sylvia

Well shes been invited to a big party at Mrs Moores brothers in
town and she hasnt got a dress to go in said Crooked Jack Theyre
great swells and everybody will be got up regardless Mrs Spencer was
telling me about it She says Miss Gray cant afford a new dress because
shes helping to pay her aunts doctors bills She says shes sure Miss
Gray feels awful disappointed over it though she doesnt let on But
Mrs Spencer says she knows she was crying after she went to bed last
night

The Old Lady turned and went into the house abruptly This was dreadful
Sylvia must go to that partyshe MUST But how was it to be managed
Through the Old Ladys brain passed wild thoughts of her mothers silk
dresses But none of them would be suitable even if there were time to
make one over Never had the Old Lady so bitterly regretted her vanished
wealth

Ive only two dollars in the house she said and Ive got to live on
that till the next day the egg pedlar comes round Is there anything I
can sellANYTHING Yes yes the grape jug

Up to this time the Old Lady would as soon have thought of trying to
sell her head as the grape jug The grape jug was two hundred years old
and had been in the Lloyd family ever since it was a jug at all It was
a big potbellied affair festooned with pinkgilt grapes and with a
verse of poetry printed on one side and it had been given as a wedding
present to the Old Ladys greatgrandmother As long as the Old Lady
could remember it had sat on the top shelf in the cupboard in the
sittingroom wall far too precious ever to be used

Two years before a woman who collected old china had explored
Spencervale and getting word of the grape jug had boldly invaded
the old Lloyd place and offered to buy it She never to her dying day
forgot the reception the Old Lady gave her but being wise in her
day and generation she left her card saying that if Miss Lloyd ever
changed her mind about selling the jug she would find that she the
aforesaid collector had not changed hers about buying it People who
make a hobby of heirloom china must meekly overlook snubs and this
particular person had never seen anything she coveted so much as that
grape jug

The Old Lady had torn the card to pieces but she remembered the name
and address She went to the cupboard and took down the beloved jug

I never thought to part with it she said wistfully but Sylvia must
have a dress and there is no other way And after all when Im gone
who would there be to have it Strangers would get it thenit might
as well go to them now Ill have to go to town tomorrow morning for
theres no time to lose if the party is Friday night I havent been to
town for ten years I dread the thought of going more than parting with
the jug But for Sylvias sake

It was all over Spencervale by the next morning that Old Lady Lloyd had
gone to town carrying a carefully guarded box Everybody wondered why
she went most people supposed she had become too frightened to keep her
money in a black box below her bed when there had been two burglaries
over at Carmody and had taken it to the bank

The Old Lady sought out the address of the china collector trembling
with fear that she might be dead or gone But the collector was there
very much alive and as keenly anxious to possess the grape jug as ever
The Old Lady pallid with the pain of her trampled pride sold the grape
jug and went away believing that her greatgrandmother must have turned
over in her grave at the moment of the transaction Old Lady Lloyd felt
like a traitor to her traditions

But she went unflinchingly to a big store and guided by that special
Providence which looks after simpleminded old souls in their dangerous
excursions into the world found a sympathetic clerk who knew just
what she wanted and got it for her The Old Lady selected a very dainty
muslin gown with gloves and slippers in keeping and she ordered
it sent at once expressage prepaid to Miss Sylvia Gray in care of
William Spencer Spencervale

Then she paid down the moneythe whole price of the jug minus a dollar
and a half for railroad farewith a grand careless air and departed
As she marched erectly down the aisle of the store she encountered
a sleek portly prosperous man coming in As their eyes met the man
started and his bland face flushed crimson he lifted his hat and bowed
confusedly But the Old Lady looked through him as if he wasnt there
and passed on with not a sign of recognition about her He took one
step after her then stopped and turned away with a rather disagreeable
smile and a shrug of his shoulders

Nobody would have guessed as the Old Lady swept out how her heart was
seething with abhorrence and scorn She would not have had the courage
to come to town even for Sylvias sake if she had thought she would
meet Andrew Cameron The mere sight of him opened up anew a sealed
fountain of bitterness in her soul but the thought of Sylvia somehow
stemmed the torrent and presently the Old Lady was smiling rather
triumphantly thinking rightly that she had come off best in that
unwelcome encounter SHE at any rate had not faltered and coloured
and lost her presence of mind

It is little wonder HE did thought the Old Lady vindictively It
pleased her that Andrew Cameron should lose before her the front of
adamant he presented to the world He was her cousin and the only living
creature Old Lady Lloyd hated and she hated and despised him with all
the intensity of her intense nature She and hers had sustained grievous
wrong at his hands and the Old Lady was convinced that she would rather
die than take any notice of his existence

Presently she resolutely put Andrew Cameron out of her mind It was
desecration to think of him and Sylvia together When she laid her weary
head on her pillow that night she was so happy that even the thought of
the vacant shelf in the room below where the grape jug had always been
gave her only a momentary pang

Its sweet to sacrifice for one we loveits sweet to have someone to
sacrifice for thought the Old Lady

Desire grows by what it feeds on The Old Lady thought she was content
but Friday evening came and found her in a perfect fever to see Sylvia
in her party dress It was not enough to fancy her in it nothing would
do the Old Lady but seeing her

And I SHALL see her said the Old Lady resolutely looking out from
her window at Sylvias light gleaming through the firs She wrapped
herself in a dark shawl and crept out slipping down to the hollow and
up the wood lane It was a misty moonlight night and a wind fragrant
with the aroma of clover fields blew down the lane to meet her

I wish I could take your perfumethe soul of youand pour it into her
life said the Old Lady aloud to that wind

Sylvia Gray was standing in her room ready for the party Before her
stood Mrs Spencer and Amelia Spencer and all the little Spencer girls
in an admiring semicircle There was another spectator Outside
under the lilac bush Old Lady Lloyd was standing She could see Sylvia
plainly in her dainty dress with the pale pink roses Old Lady Lloyd
had left at the beech that day for her in her hair Pink as they were
they were not so pink as her cheeks and her eyes shone like stars
Amelia Spencer put up her hand to push back a rose that had fallen a
little out of place and the Old Lady envied her fiercely

That dress couldnt have fitted better if it had been made for you
said Mrs Spencer admiringly Aint she lovely Amelia Who COULD have
sent it

Oh I feel sure that Mrs Moore was the fairy godmother said Sylvia
There is nobody else who would It was dear of hershe knew I wished
so much to go to the party with Janet I wish Aunty could see me now
Sylvia gave a little sigh in spite of her joy Theres nobody else to
care very much

Ah Sylvia you were wrong There was somebody elsesomebody who cared
very muchan Old Lady with eager devouring eyes who was standing
under the lilac bush and who presently stole away through the moonlit
orchard to the woods like a shadow going home with a vision of you in
your girlish beauty to companion her through the watches of that summer
night



IV The August Chapter


One day the ministers wife rushed in where Spencervale people had
feared to tread went boldly to Old Lady Lloyd and asked her if she
wouldnt come to their Sewing Circle which met fortnightly on Saturday
afternoons

We are filling a box to send to our Trinidad missionary said the
ministers wife and we should be so pleased to have you come Miss
Lloyd

The Old Lady was on the point of refusing rather haughtily Not that she
was opposed to missionsor sewing circles eitherquite the contrary
but she knew that each member of the Circle was expected to pay ten
cents a week for the purpose of procuring sewing materials and the
poor Old Lady really did not see how she could afford it But a sudden
thought checked her refusal before it reached her lips

I suppose some of the young girls go to the Circle she said craftily

Oh they all go said the ministers wife Janet Moore and Miss Gray
are our most enthusiastic members It is very lovely of Miss Gray to
give her Saturday afternoonsthe only ones she has free from pupilsto
our work But she really has the sweetest disposition

Ill join your Circle said the Old Lady promptly She was determined
she would do it if she had to live on two meals a day to save the
necessary fee

She went to the Sewing Circle at James Martins the next Saturday and
did the most beautiful hand sewing for them She was so expert at
it that she didnt need to think about it at all which was rather
fortunate for all her thoughts were taken up with Sylvia who sat in
the opposite corner with Janet Moore her graceful hands busy with a
little boys coarse gingham shirt Nobody thought of introducing Sylvia
to Old Lady Lloyd and the Old Lady was glad of it She sewed finely
away and listened with all her ears to the girlish chatter which went
on in the opposite corner One thing she found outSylvias birthday
was the twentieth of August And the Old Lady was straightway fired with
a consuming wish to give Sylvia a birthday present She lay awake
most of the night wondering if she could do it and most sorrowfully
concluded that it was utterly out of the question no matter how she
might pinch and contrive Old Lady Lloyd worried quite absurdly over
this and it haunted her like a spectre until the next Sewing Circle
day

It met at Mrs Moores and Mrs Moore was especially gracious to Old
Lady Lloyd and insisted on her taking the wicker rocker in the parlour
The Old Lady would rather have been in the sittingroom with the young
girls but she submitted for courtesys sakeand she had her reward
Her chair was just behind the parlour door and presently Janet Moore
and Sylvia Gray came and sat on the stairs in the hall outside where a
cool breeze blew in through the maples before the front door

They were talking of their favourite poets Janet it appeared adored
Byron and Scott Sylvia leaned to Tennyson and Browning

Do you know said Sylvia softly my father was a poet He published
a little volume of verse once and Janet Ive never seen a copy of
it and oh how I would love to It was published when he was at
collegejust a small private edition to give his friends He never
published any morepoor father I think life disappointed him But I
have such a longing to see that little book of his verse I havent
a scrap of his writings If I had it would seem as if I possessed
something of himof his heart his soul his inner life He would be
something more than a mere name to me

Didnt he have a copy of his owndidnt your mother have one asked
Janet

Mother hadnt She died when I was born you know but Aunty says there
was no copy of fathers poems among mothers books Mother didnt care
for poetry Aunty saysAunty doesnt either Father went to Europe
after mother died and he died there the next year Nothing that he had
with him was ever sent home to us He had sold most of his books before
he went but he gave a few of his favourite ones to Aunty to keep for
me HIS book wasnt among them I dont suppose I shall ever find a
copy but I should be so delighted if I only could

When the Old Lady got home she took from her top bureau drawer an inlaid
box of sandalwood It held a little slim limp volume wrapped in
tissue paperthe Old Ladys most treasured possession On the flyleaf
was written To Margaret with the authors love

The Old Lady turned the yellow leaves with trembling fingers and
through eyes brimming with tears read the verses although she had
known them all by heart for years She meant to give the book to Sylvia
for a birthday presentone of the most precious gifts ever given if
the value of gifts is gauged by the measure of selfsacrifice involved
In that little book was immortal loveold laughterold tearsold
beauty which had bloomed like a rose years ago holding still its
sweetness like old rose leaves She removed the telltale flyleaf and
late on the night before Sylvias birthday the Old Lady crept under
cover of the darkness through byways and across fields as if bent on
some nefarious expedition to the little Spencervale store where the
postoffice was kept She slipped the thin parcel through the slit in
the door and then stole home again feeling a strange sense of loss
and loneliness It was as if she had given away the last link between
herself and her youth But she did not regret it It would give Sylvia
pleasure and that had come to be the overmastering passion of the Old
Ladys heart

The next night the light in Sylvias room burned very late and the
Old Lady watched it triumphantly knowing the meaning of it Sylvia was
reading her fathers poems and the Old Lady in her darkness read them
too murmuring the lines over and over to herself After all giving
away the book had not mattered so very much She had the soul of it
stilland the flyleaf with the name in Leslies writing by which
nobody ever called her now

The Old Lady was sitting on the Marshall sofa the next Sewing Circle
afternoon when Sylvia Gray came and sat down beside her The Old Ladys
hands trembled a little and one side of a handkerchief which was
afterwards given as a Christmas present to a little oliveskinned coolie
in Trinidad was not quite so exquisitely done as the other three sides

Sylvia at first talked of the Circle and Mrs Marshalls dahlias and
the Old Lady was in the seventh heaven of delight though she took care
not to show it and was even a little more stately and finely mannered
than usual When she asked Sylvia how she liked living in Spencervale
Sylvia said

Very much Everybody is so kind to me BesidesSylvia lowered her
voice so that nobody but the Old Lady could hear itI have a fairy
godmother here who does the most beautiful and wonderful things for me

Sylvia being a girl of fine instincts did not look at Old Lady Lloyd
as she said this But she would not have seen anything if she had
looked The Old Lady was not a Lloyd for nothing

How very interesting she said indifferently

Isnt it I am so grateful to her and I have wished so much she might
know how much pleasure she has given me I have found lovely flowers
and delicious berries on my path all summer I feel sure she sent me
my party dress But the dearest gift came last week on my birthdaya
little volume of my fathers poems I cant express what I felt on
receiving them But I longed to meet my fairy godmother and thank her

Quite a fascinating mystery isnt it Have you really no idea who she
is

The Old Lady asked this dangerous question with marked success She
would not have been so successful if she had not been so sure that
Sylvia had no idea of the old romance between her and Leslie Gray As it
was she had a comfortable conviction that she herself was the very last
person Sylvia would be likely to suspect

Sylvia hesitated for an almost unnoticeable moment Then she said I
havent tried to find out because I dont think she wants me to know
At first of course in the matter of the flowers and dress I did try
to solve the mystery but since I received the book I became convinced
that it was my fairy godmother who was doing it all and I have
respected her wish for concealment and always shall Perhaps some day
she will reveal herself to me I hope so at least

I wouldnt hope it said the Old Lady discouragingly Fairy
godmothersat least in all the fairy tales I ever readare somewhat
apt to be queer crochety people much more agreeable when wrapped up in
mystery than when met face to face

Im convinced that mine is the very opposite and that the better I
became acquainted with her the more charming a personage I should find
her said Sylvia gaily

Mrs Marshall came up at this juncture and entreated Miss Gray to sing
for them Miss Gray consenting sweetly the Old Lady was left alone and
was rather glad of it She enjoyed her conversation with Sylvia much
more in thinking it over after she got home than while it was taking
place When an Old Lady has a guilty conscience it is apt to make her
nervous and distract her thoughts from immediate pleasure She wondered
a little uneasily if Sylvia really did suspect her Then she concluded
that it was out of the question Who would suspect a mean unsociable
Old Lady who had no friends and who gave only five cents to the Sewing
Circle when everyone else gave ten or fifteen to be a fairy godmother
the donor of beautiful party dresses and the recipient of gifts from
romantic aspiring young poets



V The September Chapter


In September the Old Lady looked back on the summer and owned to herself
that it had been a strangely happy one with Sundays and Sewing Circle
days standing out like golden punctuation marks in a poem of life
She felt like an utterly different woman and other people thought her
different also The Sewing Circle women found her so pleasant and even
friendly that they began to think they had misjudged her and that
perhaps it was eccentricity after all and not meanness which accounted
for her peculiar mode of living Sylvia Gray always came and talked to
her on Circle afternoons now and the Old Lady treasured every word she
said in her heart and repeated them over and over to her lonely self in
the watches of the night

Sylvia never talked of herself or her plans unless asked about them
and the Old Ladys selfconsciousness prevented her from asking any
personal questions so their conversation kept to the surface of things
and it was not from Sylvia but from the ministers wife that the Old
Lady finally discovered what her darlings dearest ambition was

The ministers wife had dropped in at the old Lloyd place one evening
late in September when a chilly wind was blowing up from the northeast
and moaning about the eaves of the house as if the burden of its
lay were harvest is ended and summer is gone The Old Lady had been
listening to it as she plaited a little basket of sweet grass for
Sylvia She had walked all the way to Avonlea sandhills for it the
day before and she was very tired And her heart was sad This summer
which had so enriched her life was almost over and she knew that
Sylvia Gray talked of leaving Spencervale at the end of October The
Old Ladys heart felt like very lead within her at the thought and
she almost welcomed the advent of the ministers wife as a distraction
although she was desperately afraid that the ministers wife had called
to ask for a subscription for the new vestry carpet and the Old Lady
simply could not afford to give one cent

But the ministers wife had merely dropped in on her way home from the
Spencers and she did not make any embarrassing requests Instead she
talked about Sylvia Gray and her words fell on the Old Ladys ears like
separate pearl notes of unutterably sweet music The ministers wife
had nothing but praise for Sylviashe was so sweet and beautiful and
winning

And with SUCH a voice said the ministers wife enthusiastically
adding with a sigh Its such a shame she cant have it properly
trained She would certainly become a great singercompetent critics
have told her so But she is so poor she doesnt think she can ever
possibly manage itunless she can get one of the Cameron scholarships
as they are called and she has very little hope of that although the
professor of music who taught her has sent her name in

What are the Cameron scholarships asked the Old Lady

Well I suppose you have heard of Andrew Cameron the millionaire
said the ministers wife serenely unconscious that she was causing the
very bones of the Old Ladys family skeleton to jangle in their closet

Into the Old Ladys white face came a sudden faint stain of colour as
if a rough hand had struck her cheek

Yes Ive heard of him she said

Well it seems that he had a daughter who was a very beautiful girl
and whom he idolized She had a fine voice and he was going to send her
abroad to have it trained And she died It nearly broke his heart I
understand But ever since he sends one young girl away to Europe every
year for a thorough musical education under the best teachersin memory
of his daughter He has sent nine or ten already but I fear there isnt
much chance for Sylvia Gray and she doesnt think there is herself

Why not asked the Old Lady spiritedly I am sure that there can be
few voices equal to Miss Grays

Very true But you see these socalled scholarships are private
affairs dependent solely on the whim and choice of Andrew Cameron
himself Of course when a girl has friends who use their influence with
him he will often send her on their recommendation They say he sent a
girl last year who hadnt much of a voice at all just because her father
had been an old business crony of his But Sylvia doesnt know anyone at
all who would to use a slang term have any pull with Andrew Cameron
and she is not acquainted with him herself Well I must be going well
see you at the Manse on Saturday I hope Miss Lloyd The Circle meets
there you know

Yes I know said the Old Lady absently When the ministers wife had
gone she dropped her sweetgrass basket and sat for a long long time
with her hands lying idly in her lap and her big black eyes staring
unseeingly at the wall before her

Old Lady Lloyd so pitifully poor that she had to eat six crackers the
less a week to pay her fee to the Sewing Circle knew that it was in her
powerHERSto send Leslie Grays daughter to Europe for her musical
education If she chose to use her pull with Andrew Cameronif she
went to him and asked him to send Sylvia Gray abroad the next
yearshe had no doubt whatever that it would be done It all lay with
herififIF she could so far crush and conquer her pride as to stoop
to ask a favour of the man who had wronged her and hers so bitterly

Years ago her father acting under the advice and urgency of Andrew
Cameron had invested all his little fortune in an enterprise that had
turned out a failure Abraham Lloyd lost every dollar he possessed and
his family were reduced to utter poverty Andrew Cameron might have been
forgiven for a mistake but there was a strong suspicion amounting to
almost certainty that he had been guilty of something far worse than
a mistake in regard to his uncles investment Nothing could be legally
proved but it was certain that Andrew Cameron already noted for his
sharp practices emerged with improved finances from an entanglement
that had ruined many better men and old Doctor Lloyd had died
brokenhearted believing that his nephew had deliberately victimized
him

Andrew Cameron had not quite done this he had meant well enough by
his uncle at first and what he had finally done he tried to justify to
himself by the doctrine that a man must look out for Number One

Margaret Lloyd made no such excuses for him she held him responsible
not only for her lost fortune but for her fathers death and never
forgave him for it When Abraham Lloyd had died Andrew Cameron perhaps
pricked by his conscience had come to her sleekly and smoothly to
offer her financial aid He would see he told her that she never
suffered want

Margaret Lloyd flung his offer back in his face after a fashion that
left nothing to be desired in the way of plain speaking She would die
she told him passionately before she would accept a penny or a favour
from him He had preserved an unbroken show of good temper expressed
his heartfelt regret that she should cherish such an unjust opinion of
him and had left her with an oily assurance that he would always be her
friend and would always be delighted to render her any assistance in
his power whenever she should choose to ask for it

The Old Lady had lived for twenty years in the firm conviction that she
would die in the poorhouseas indeed seemed not unlikelybefore she
would ask a favour of Andrew Cameron And so in truth she would have
had it been for herself But for Sylvia Could she so far humble herself
for Sylvias sake

The question was not easily or speedily settled as had been the case in
the matters of the grape jug and the book of poems For a whole week
the Old Lady fought her pride and bitterness Sometimes in the hours
of sleepless night when all human resentments and rancours seemed petty
and contemptible she thought she had conquered it But in the daytime
with the picture of her father looking down at her from the wall
and the rustle of her unfashionable dresses worn because of Andrew
Camerons double dealing in her ears it got the better of her again

But the Old Ladys love for Sylvia had grown so strong and deep and
tender that no other feeling could endure finally against it Love is
a great miracle worker and never had its power been more strongly made
manifest than on the cold dull autumn morning when the Old Lady walked
to Bright River railway station and took the train to Charlottetown
bent on an errand the very thought of which turned her soul sick within
her The station master who sold her her ticket thought Old Lady Lloyd
looked uncommonly white and peakedas if she hadnt slept a wink
or eaten a bite for a week he told his wife at dinner time Guess
theres something wrong in her business affairs This is the second time
shes gone to town this summer

When the Old Lady reached the town she ate her slender little lunch and
then walked out to the suburb where the Cameron factories and warehouses
were It was a long walk for her but she could not afford to drive She
felt very tired when she was shown into the shining luxurious office
where Andrew Cameron sat at his desk

After the first startled glance of surprise he came forward beamingly
with outstretched hand

Why Cousin Margaret This is a pleasant surprise Sit downallow me
this is a much more comfortable chair Did you come in this morning And
how is everybody out in Spencervale

The Old Lady had flushed at his first words To hear the name by which
her father and mother and lover had called her on Andrew Camerons lips
seemed like profanation But she told herself the time was past for
squeamishness If she could ask a favour of Andrew Cameron she could
bear lesser pangs For Sylvias sake she shook hands with him for
Sylvias sake she sat down in the chair he offered But for no living
human beings sake could this determined Old Lady infuse any cordiality
into her manner or her words She went straight to the point with Lloyd
simplicity

I have come to ask a favour of you she said looking him in the eye
not at all humbly or meekly as became a suppliant but challengingly
and defiantly as if she dared him to refuse

DElighted to hear it Cousin Margaret Never was anything so bland
and gracious as his tone Anything I can do for you I shall be only
too pleased to do I am afraid you have looked upon me as an enemy
Margaret and I assure you I have felt your injustice keenly I realize
that some appearances were against me but

The Old Lady lifted her hand and stemmed his eloquence by that one
gesture

I did not come here to discuss that matter she said We will not
refer to the past if you please I came to ask a favour not for
myself but for a very dear young friend of minea Miss Gray who has a
remarkably fine voice which she wishes to have trained She is poor
so I came to ask you if you would give her one of your musical
scholarships I understand her name has already been suggested to you
with a recommendation from her teacher I do not know what he has said
of her voice but I do know he could hardly overrate it If you send her
abroad for training you will not make any mistake

The Old Lady stopped talking She felt sure Andrew Cameron would
grant her request but she did hope he would grant it rather rudely or
unwillingly She could accept the favour so much more easily if it were
flung to her like a bone to a dog But not a bit of it Andrew Cameron
was suaver than ever Nothing could give him greater pleasure than to
grant his dear Cousin Margarets requesthe only wished it involved
more trouble on his part Her little protege should have her musical
education assuredlyshe should go abroad next yearand he was
DElighted

Thank you said the Old Lady cutting him short again I am much
obliged to youand I ask you not to let Miss Gray know anything of my
interference And I shall not take up any more of your valuable time
Good afternoon

Oh you mustnt go so soon he said with some real kindness or
clannishness permeating the hateful cordiality of his voicefor Andrew
Cameron was not entirely without the homely virtues of the average man
He had been a good husband and father he had once been very fond of his
Cousin Margaret and he was really very sorry that circumstances had
compelled him to act as he had done in that old affair of her fathers
investment You must be my guest tonight

Thank you I must return home tonight said the Old Lady firmly and
there was that in her tone which told Andrew Cameron that it would be
useless to urge her But he insisted on telephoning for his carriage to
drive her to the station The Old Lady submitted to this because she
was secretly afraid her own legs would not suffice to carry her there
she even shook hands with him at parting and thanked him a second time
for granting her request

Not at all he said Please try to think a little more kindly of me
Cousin Margaret

When the Old Lady reached the station she found to her dismay that her
train had just gone and that she would have to wait two hours for the
evening one She went into the waitingroom and sat down She was very
tired All the excitement that had sustained her was gone and she felt
weak and old She had nothing to eat having expected to get home in
time for tea the waitingroom was chilly and she shivered in her thin
old silk mantilla Her head ached and her heart likewise She had won
Sylvias desire for her but Sylvia would go out of her life and the
Old Lady did not see how she was to go on living after that Yet she sat
there unflinchingly for two hours an upright indomitable old figure
silently fighting her losing battle with the forces of physical and
mental pain while happy people came and went and laughed and talked
before her

At eight oclock the Old Lady got off the train at Bright River station
and slipped off unnoticed into the darkness of the wet night She had
two miles to walk and a cold rain was falling Soon the Old Lady was
wet to the skin and chilled to the marrow She felt as if she were
walking in a bad dream Blind instinct alone guided her over the last
mile and up the lane to her own house As she fumbled at her door
she realized that a burning heat had suddenly taken the place of her
chilliness She stumbled in over her threshold and closed the door



VI The October Chapter


On the second morning after Old Lady Lloyds journey to town Sylvia
Gray was walking blithely down the wood lane It was a beautiful autumn
morning clear and crisp and sunny the frosted ferns drenched and
battered with the rain of yesterday gave out a delicious fragrance
here and there in the woods a maple waved a gay crimson banner or a
branch of birch showed pale golden against the dark unchanging spruces
The air was very pure and exhilarating Sylvia walked with a joyous
lightness of step and uplift of brow

At the beech in the hollow she paused for an expectant moment but there
was nothing among the gray old roots for her She was just turning
away when little Teddy Kimball who lived next door to the manse
came running down the slope from the direction of the old Lloyd place
Teddys freckled face was very pale

Oh Miss Gray he gasped I guess Old Lady Lloyd has gone clean crazy
at last The ministers wife asked me to run up to the Old Lady with a
message about the Sewing Circleand I knockedand knockedand nobody
cameso I thought Id just step in and leave the letter on the
table But when I opened the door I heard an awful queer laugh in the
sittingroom and next minute the Old Lady came to the sittingroom
door Oh Miss Gray she looked awful Her face was red and her eyes
awful wildand she was muttering and talking to herself and laughing
like mad I was so scared I just turned and run

Sylvia without stopping for reflection caught Teddys hand and ran
up the slope It did not occur to her to be frightened although she
thought with Teddy that the poor lonely eccentric Old Lady had really
gone out of her mind at last

The Old Lady was sitting on the kitchen sofa when Sylvia entered Teddy
too frightened to go in lurked on the step outside The Old Lady still
wore the damp black silk dress in which she had walked from the station
Her face was flushed her eyes wild her voice hoarse But she knew
Sylvia and cowered down

Dont look at me she moaned Please go awayI cant bear that YOU
should know how poor I am Youre to go to EuropeAndrew Cameron is
going to send youI asked himhe couldnt refuse ME But please go
away

Sylvia did not go away At a glance she had seen that this was sickness
and delirium not insanity She sent Teddy off in hot haste for Mrs
Spencer and when Mrs Spencer came they induced the Old Lady to go to
bed and sent for the doctor By night everybody in Spencervale knew
that Old Lady Lloyd had pneumonia

Mrs Spencer announced that she meant to stay and nurse the Old
Lady Several other women offered assistance Everybody was kind and
thoughtful But the Old Lady did not know it She did not even know
Sylvia Gray who came and sat by her every minute she could spare
Sylvia Gray now knew all that she had suspectedthe Old Lady was her
fairy godmother The Old Lady babbled of Sylvia incessantly revealing
all her love for her betraying all the sacrifices she had made
Sylvias heart ached with love and tenderness and she prayed earnestly
that the Old Lady might recover

I want her to know that I give her love for love she murmured

Everybody knew now how poor the Old Lady really was She let slip all
the jealously guarded secrets of her existence except her old love for
Leslie Gray Even in delirium something sealed her lips as to that
But all else came outher anguish over her unfashionable attire
her pitiful makeshifts and contrivances her humiliation over wearing
unfashionable dresses and paying only five cents where every other
Sewing Circle member paid ten The kindly women who waited on her
listened to her with tearfilled eyes and repented of their harsh
judgments in the past

But who would have thought it said Mrs Spencer to the ministers
wife Nobody ever dreamed that her father had lost ALL his money
though folks supposed he had lost some in that old affair of the silver
mine out west Its shocking to think of the way she has lived all these
years often with not enough to eatand going to bed in winter days to
save fuel Though I suppose if we had known we couldnt have done much
for her shes so desperate proud But if she lives and will let us
help her things will be different after this Crooked Jack says hell
never forgive himself for taking pay for the few little jobs he did for
her He says if shell only let him hell do everything she wants done
for her after this for nothing Aint it strange what a fancy shes took
to Miss Gray Think of her doing all those things for her all summer
and selling the grape jug and all Well the Old Lady certainly isnt
mean but nobody made a mistake in calling her queer It all does seem
desperate pitiful Miss Grays taking it awful hard She seems to think
about as much of the Old Lady as the Old Lady thinks of her Shes so
worked up she dont even seem to care about going to Europe next year
Shes really goingshes had word from Andrew Cameron Im awful glad
for there never was a sweeter girl in the world but she says it will
cost too much if the Old Ladys life is to pay for it

Andrew Cameron heard of the Old Ladys illness and came out to
Spencervale himself He was not allowed to see the Old Lady of course
but he told all concerned that no expense or trouble was to be spared
and the Spencervale doctor was instructed to send his bill to Andrew
Cameron and hold his peace about it Moreover when Andrew Cameron
went back home he sent a trained nurse out to wait on the Old Lady a
capable kindly woman who contrived to take charge of the case without
offending Mrs Spencerthan which no higher tribute could be paid to
her tact

The Old Lady did not diethe Lloyd constitution brought her through
One day when Sylvia came in the Old Lady smiled up at her with a
weak faint sensible smile and murmured her name and the nurse said
that the crisis was past

The Old Lady made a marvellously patient and tractable invalid She did
just as she was told and accepted the presence of the nurse as a matter
of course

But one day when she was strong enough to talk a little she said to
Sylvia

I suppose Andrew Cameron sent Miss Hayes here did he Yes said
Sylvia rather timidly

The Old Lady noticed the timidity and smiled with something of her old
humour and spirit in her black eyes

Time has been when Id have packed off unceremoniously any person
Andrew Cameron sent here she said But Sylvia I have gone through
the Valley of the Shadow of Death and I have left pride and resentment
behind me for ever I hope I no longer feel as I felt towards Andrew
I can even accept a personal favour from him now At last I can forgive
him for the wrong he did me and mine Sylvia I find that I have been
letting no ends of cats out of bags in my illness Everybody knows now
how poor I ambut I dont seem to mind it a bit Im only sorry that
I ever shut my neighbours out of my life because of my foolish pride
Everyone has been so kind to me Sylvia In the future if my life is
spared it is going to be a very different sort of life Im going to
open it to all the kindness and companionship I can find in young and
old Im going to help them all I can and let them help me I CAN help
peopleIve learned that money isnt the only power for helping people
Anyone who has sympathy and understanding to give has a treasure that is
without money and without price And oh Sylvia youve found out what I
never meant you to know But I dont mind that now either

Sylvia took the Old Ladys thin white hand and kissed it

I can never thank you enough for what you have done for me dearest
Miss Lloyd she said earnestly And I am so glad that all mystery is
done away with between us and I can love you as much and as openly as
I have longed to do I am so glad and so thankful that you love me dear
fairy godmother

Do you know WHY I love you so said the Old Lady wistfully Did I let
THAT out in my raving too

No but I think I know It is because I am Leslie Grays daughter
isnt it I know that father loved youhis brother Uncle Willis told
me all about it

I spoiled my own life because of my wicked pride said the Old Lady
sadly But you will love me in spite of it all wont you Sylvia And
you will come to see me sometimes And write me after you go away

I am coming to see you every day said Sylvia I am going to stay
in Spencervale for a whole year yet just to be near you And next year
when I go to Europethanks to you fairy godmotherIll write you
every day We are going to be the best of chums and we are going to
have a most beautiful year of comradeship

The Old Lady smiled contentedly Out in the kitchen the ministers
wife who had brought up a dish of jelly was talking to Mrs Spencer
about the Sewing Circle Through the open window where the red vines
hung came the pungent sunwarm October air The sunshine fell over
Sylvias chestnut hair like a crown of glory and youth

I do feel so perfectly happy said the Old Lady with a long
rapturous breath





III Each In His Own Tongue


The honeytinted autumn sunshine was falling thickly over the crimson
and amber maples around old Abel Blairs door There was only one outer
door in old Abels house and it almost always stood wide open A little
black dog with one ear missing and a lame forepaw almost always slept
on the worn red sandstone slab which served old Abel for a doorstep
and on the still more worn sill above it a large gray cat almost always
slept Just inside the door on a bandylegged chair of elder days old
Abel almost always sat

He was sitting there this afternoona little old man sadly twisted
with rheumatism his head was abnormally large thatched with long wiry
black hair his face was heavily lined and swarthily sunburned his
eyes were deepset and black with occasional peculiar golden flashes in
them A strange looking man was old Abel Blair and as strange was he as
he looked Lower Carmody people would have told you

Old Abel was almost always sober in these his later years He was sober
today He liked to bask in that ripe sunlight as well as his dog and
cat did and in such baskings he almost always looked out of his doorway
at the far fine blue sky over the tops of the crowding maples But
today he was not looking at the sky instead he was staring at the
black dusty rafters of his kitchen where hung dried meats and strings
of onions and bunches of herbs and fishing tackle and guns and skins

But old Abel saw not these things his face was the face of a man who
beholds visions compact of heavenly pleasure and hellish pain for old
Abel was seeing what he might have beenand what he was as he always
saw when Felix Moore played to him on the violin And the awful joy of
dreaming that he was young again with unspoiled life before him was
so great and compelling that it counterbalanced the agony in the
realization of a dishonoured old age following years in which he had
squandered the wealth of his soul in ways where Wisdom lifted not her
voice

Felix Moore was standing opposite to him before an untidy stove where
the noon fire had died down into pallid scattered ashes Under his chin
he held old Abels brown battered fiddle his eyes too were fixed
on the ceiling and he too saw things not lawful to be uttered in any
language save that of music and of all music only that given forth by
the anguished enraptured spirit of the violin And yet this Felix was
little more than twelve years old and his face was still the face of a
child who knows nothing of either sorrow or sin or failure or remorse
Only in his large grayblack eyes was there something not of the
childsomething that spoke of an inheritance from many hearts now
ashes which had aforetime grieved and joyed and struggled and failed
and succeeded and grovelled The inarticulate cries of their longings
had passed into this childs soul and transmuted themselves into the
expression of his music

Felix was a beautiful child Carmody people who stayed at home thought
so and old Abel Blair who had roamed afar in many lands thought so
and even the Rev Stephen Leonard who taught and tried to believe
that favour is deceitful and beauty is vain thought so

He was a slight lad with sloping shoulders a slim brown neck and a
head set on it with staglike grace and uplift His hair cut straight
across his brow and falling over his ears after some caprice of Janet
Andrews the ministers housekeeper was a glossy blueblack The
skin of his face and hands was like ivory his eyes were large and
beautifully tintedgray with dilating pupils his features had the
outlines of a cameo Carmody mothers considered him delicate and had
long foretold that the minister would never bring him up but old Abel
pulled his grizzled moustache when he heard such forebodings and smiled

Felix Moore will live he said positively You cant kill that kind
until their work is done Hes got a work to doif the ministerll let
him do it And if the minister dont let him do it then I wouldnt be
in that ministers shoes when he comes to the judgmentno Id rather
be in my own Its an awful thing to cross the purposes of the Almighty
either in your own life or anybody elses Sometimes I think its whats
meant by the unpardonable sinay that I do

Carmody people never asked what old Abel meant They had long ago given
up such vain questioning When a man had lived as old Abel had lived for
the greater part of his life was it any wonder he said crazy things
And as for hinting that Mr Leonard a man who was really almost
too good to live was guilty of any sin much less an unpardonable
onewell there now what use was it to be taking any account of old
Abels queer speeches Though to be sure there was no great harm in
a fiddle and maybe Mr Leonard was a mite too strict that way with the
child But then could you wonder at it There was his father you see

Felix finally lowered the violin and came back to old Abels kitchen
with a long sigh Old Abel smiled drearily at himthe smile of a man
who has been in the hands of the tormentors

Its awful the way you playits awful he said with a shudder I
never heard anything like itand you that never had any teaching since
you were nine years old and not much practice except what you could
get here now and then on my old battered fiddle And to think you make
it up yourself as you go along I suppose your grandfather would never
hear to your studying musicwould he now

Felix shook his head

I know he wouldnt Abel He wants me to be a minister Ministers are
good things to be but Im afraid I cant be a minister

Not a pulpit minister Theres different kinds of ministers and each
must talk to men in his own tongue if hes going to do em any real
good said old Abel meditatively YOUR tongue is music Strange that
your grandfather cant see that for himself and him such a broadminded
man Hes the only minister I ever had much use for Hes Gods own if
ever a man was And he loves youyes sir he loves you like the apple
of his eye

And I love him said Felix warmly I love him so much that Ill even
try to be a minister for his sake though I dont want to be

What do you want to be

A great violinist answered the child his ivoryhued face suddenly
warming into living rose I want to play to thousandsand see their
eyes look as yours do when I play Sometimes your eyes frighten me but
oh its a splendid fright If I had fathers violin I could do better
I remember that he once said it had a soul that was doing purgatory for
its sins when it had lived on earth I dont know what he meant but it
did seem to me that HIS violin was alive He taught me to play on it as
soon as I was big enough to hold it

Did you love your father asked old Abel with a keen look

Again Felix crimsoned but he looked straightly and steadily into his
old friends face

No he said I didnt but he added gravely and deliberately I
dont think you should have asked me such a question

It was old Abels turn to blush Carmody people would not have believed
he could blush and perhaps no living being could have called that
deepening hue into his weatherbeaten cheek save only this grayeyed
child of the rebuking face

No I guess I shouldnt he said But Im always making mistakes
Ive never made anything else Thats why Im nothing more than Old
Abel to the Carmody people Nobody but you and your grandfather ever
calls me Mr Blair Yet William Blair at the store up there rich and
respected as he is wasnt half as clever a man as I was when we started
in life you maynt believe that but its true And the worst of it is
young Felix that most of the time I dont care whether Im Mr Blair or
old Abel Only when you play I care It makes me feel just as a look I
saw in a little girls eyes some years ago made me feel Her name was
Anne Shirley and she lived with the Cuthberts down at Avonlea We got
into a conversation at Blairs store She could talk a blue streak
to anyone that girl could I happened to say about something that it
didnt matter to a battered old hulk of sixty odd like me She looked
at me with her big innocent eyes a little reproachful like as if Id
said something awful heretical Dont you think Mr Blair she says
that the older we get the more things ought to matter to usas grave
as if shed been a hundred instead of eleven Things matter SO much to
me now she says clasping her hands thisaway and Im sure that when
Im sixty theyll matter just five times as much to me Well the
way she looked and the way she spoke made me feel downright ashamed of
myself because things had stopped mattering with me But never mind all
that My miserable old feelings dont count for much What come of your
fathers fiddle

Grandfather took it away when I came here I think he burned it And I
long for it so often

Well youve always got my old brown fiddle to come to when you must

Yes I know And Im glad for that But Im hungry for a violin all the
time And I only come here when the hunger gets too much to bear I
feel as if I oughtnt to come even thenIm always saying I wont do it
again because I know grandfather wouldnt like it if he knew

He has never forbidden it has he

No but that is because he doesnt know I come here for that He never
thinks of such a thing I feel sure he WOULD forbid it if he knew And
that makes me very wretched And yet I HAVE to come Mr Blair do you
know why grandfather cant bear to have me play on the violin He loves
music and he doesnt mind my playing on the organ if I dont neglect
other things I cant understand it can you

I have a pretty good idea but I cant tell you It isnt my secret
Maybe hell tell you himself some day But mark you young Felix he
has got good reasons for it all Knowing what I know I cant blame him
over much though I think hes mistaken Come now play something more
for me before you gosomething thats bright and happy this time so
as to leave me with a good taste in my mouth That last thing you played
took me straight to heavenbut heavens awful near to hell and at the
last you tipped me in

I dont understand you said Felix drawing his fine narrow black
brows together in a perplexed frown

Noand I wouldnt want you to You couldnt understand unless you was
an old man who had it in him once to do something and be a MAN and just
went and made himself a devilish fool But there must be something in
you that understands thingsall kinds of thingsor you couldnt put it
all into music the way you do How do you do it How inhow DO you do
it young Felix

I dont know But I play differently to different people I dont know
how that is When Im alone with you I have to play one way and
when Janet comes over here to listen I feel quite another waynot so
thrilling but happier and lonelier And that day when Jessie Blair was
here listening I felt as if I wanted to laugh and singas if the violin
wanted to laugh and sing all the time

The strange golden gleam flashed through old Abels sunken eyes

God he muttered under his breath I believe the boy can get into
other folks souls somehow and play out what HIS soul sees there

Whats that you say inquired Felix petting his fiddle

Nothingnever mindgo on Something lively now young Felix Stop
probing into my soul where you havent no business to be you infant
and play me something out of your ownsomething sweet and happy and
pure

Ill play the way I feel on sunshiny mornings when the birds are
singing and I forget I have to be a minister said Felix simply



A witching gurgling mirthful strain like mingled bird and brook song
floated out on the still air along the path where the red and golden
maple leaves were falling very softly one by one The Reverend Stephen
Leonard heard it as he came along the way and the Reverend Stephen
Leonard smiled Now when Stephen Leonard smiled children ran to him
and grown people felt as if they looked from Pisgah over to some fair
land of promise beyond the fret and worry of their caredimmed earthly
lives

Mr Leonard loved music as he loved all things beautiful whether in
the material or the spiritual world though he did not realize how much
he loved them for their beauty alone or he would have been shocked and
remorseful He himself was beautiful His figure was erect and youthful
despite seventy years His face was as mobile and charming as a womans
yet with all a mans tried strength and firmness in it and his dark
blue eyes flashed with the brilliance of one and twenty even his silken
silvery hair could not make an old man of him He was worshipped by
everyone who knew him and he was in so far as mortal man may be
worthy of that worship

Old Abel is amusing himself with his violin again he thought What
a delicious thing he is playing He has quite a gift for the violin But
how can he play such a thing as thata battered old hulk of a man who
has at one time or another wallowed in almost every sin to which human
nature can sink He was on one of his sprees three days agothe
first one for over a yearlying deaddrunk in the market square in
Charlottetown among the dogs and now he is playing something that only
a young archangel on the hills of heaven ought to be able to play Well
it will make my task all the easier Abel is always repentant by the
time he is able to play on his fiddle

Mr Leonard was on the doorstone The little black dog had frisked down
to meet him and the gray cat rubbed her head against his leg Old Abel
did not notice him he was beating time with uplifted hand and smiling
face to Felixs music and his eyes were young again glowing with
laughter and sheer happiness

Felix what does this mean

The violin bow clattered from Felixs hand upon the floor he swung
around and faced his grandfather As he met the passion of grief and
hurt in the old mans eyes his own clouded with an agony of repentance

GrandfatherIm sorry he cried brokenly

Now now Old Abel had risen deprecatingly Its all my fault Mr
Leonard Dont you blame the boy I coaxed him to play a bit for me I
didnt feel fit to touch the fiddle yet myselftoo soon after Friday
you see So I coaxed him onwouldnt give him no peace till he played
Its all my fault

No said Felix throwing back his head His face was as white as
marble yet it seemed ablaze with desperate truth and scorn of old
Abels shielding lie No grandfather it isnt Abels fault I came
over here on purpose to play because I thought you had gone to the
harbour I have come here often ever since I have lived with you

Ever since you have lived with me you have been deceiving me like this
Felix

There was no anger in Mr Leonards toneonly measureless sorrow The
boys sensitive lips quivered

Forgive me grandfather he whispered beseechingly

You never forbid him to come old Abel broke in angrily Be just Mr
Leonardbe just

I AM just Felix knows that he has disobeyed me in the spirit if not
in the letter Do you not know it Felix

Yes grandfather I have done wrongIve known that I was doing wrong
every time I came Forgive me grandfather

Felix I forgive you but I ask you to promise me here and now
that you will never again as long as you live touch a violin Dusky
crimson rushed madly over the boys face He gave a cry as if he had
been lashed with a whip Old Abel sprang to his feet

Dont you ask such a promise of him Mr Leonard he cried furiously
Its a sin thats what it is Man man what blinds you You ARE
blind Cant you see what is in the boy His soul is full of music
Itll torture him to deathor to worseif you dont let it have way

There is a devil in such music said Mr Leonard hotly

Ay there may be but dont forget that theres a Christ in it too
retorted old Abel in a low tense tone

Mr Leonard looked shocked he considered that old Abel had uttered
blasphemy He turned away from him rebukingly

Felix promise me

There was no relenting in his face or tone He was merciless in the
use of the power he possessed over that young loving spirit Felix
understood that there was no escape but his lips were very white as he
said

I promise grandfather

Mr Leonard drew a long breath of relief He knew that promise would be
kept So did old Abel The latter crossed the floor and sullenly took
the violin from Felixs relaxed hand Without a word or look he went
into the little bedroom off the kitchen and shut the door with a slam
of righteous indignation But from its window he stealthily watched his
visitors go away Just as they entered on the maple path Mr Leonard
laid his hand on Felixs head and looked down at him Instantly the boy
flung his arm up over the old mans shoulder and smiled at him In
the look they exchanged there was boundless love and trustay and
goodfellowship Old Abels scornful eyes again held the golden flash

How those two love each other he muttered enviously And how they
torture each other



Mr Leonard went to his study to pray when he got home He knew that
Felix had run for comforting to Janet Andrews the little thin
sweetfaced rigidlipped woman who kept house for them Mr Leonard
knew that Janet would disapprove of his action as deeply as old Abel had
done She would say nothing she would only look at him with reproachful
eyes over the teacups at suppertime But Mr Leonard believed he had
done what was best and his conscience did not trouble him though his
heart did

Thirteen years before this his daughter Margaret had almost broken that
heart by marrying a man of whom he could not approve Martin Moore was
a professional violinist He was a popular performer though not in any
sense a great one He met the slim goldenhaired daughter of the manse
at the house of a college friend she was visiting in Toronto and
fell straightway in love with her Margaret had loved him with all
her virginal heart in return and married him despite her fathers
disapproval It was not to Martin Moores profession that Mr Leonard
objected but to the man himself He knew that the violinists past
life had not been such as became a suitor for Margaret Leonard and his
insight into character warned him that Martin Moore could never make any
woman lastingly happy

Margaret Leonard did not believe this She married Martin Moore and
lived one year in paradise Perhaps that atoned for the three bitter
years which followedthat and her child At all events she died as
she had lived loyal and uncomplaining She died alone for her husband
was away on a concert tour and her illness was so brief that her father
had not time to reach her before the end Her body was taken home to be
buried beside her mother in the little Carmody churchyard Mr Leonard
wished to take the child but Martin Moore refused to give him up

Six years later Moore too died and at last Mr Leonard had his
hearts desirethe possession of Margarets son The grandfather
awaited the childs coming with mingled feelings His heart yearned for
him yet he dreaded to meet a second edition of Martin Moore Suppose
Margarets son resembled his handsome vagabond of a father Or worse
still suppose he were cursed with his fathers lack of principle his
instability his Bohemian instincts Thus Mr Leonard tortured himself
wretchedly before the coming of Felix

The child did not look like either father or mother Instead Mr
Leonard found himself looking into a face which he had put away under
the grasses thirty years beforethe face of his girl bride who had
died at Margarets birth Here again were her lustrous grayblack eyes
her ivory outlines her finetraced arch of brow and here looking out
of those eyes seemed her very spirit again From that moment the soul
of the old man was knit to the soul of the child and they loved each
other with a love surpassing that of women

Felixs only inheritance from his father was his love of music But the
child had genius where his father had possessed only talent To
Martin Moores outward mastery of the violin was added the mystery and
intensity of his mothers nature with some more subtle quality still
which had perhaps come to him from the grandmother he so strongly
resembled Moore had understood what a career was naturally before the
child and he had trained him in the technique of his art from the time
the slight fingers could first grasp the bow When nineyearold Felix
came to the Carmody manse he had mastered as much of the science of
the violin as nine out of ten musicians acquire in a lifetime and he
brought with him his fathers violin it was all Martin Moore had to
leave his sonbut it was an Amati the commercial value of which nobody
in Carmody suspected Mr Leonard had taken possession of it and Felix
had never seen it since He cried himself to sleep many a night for
the loss of it Mr Leonard did not know this and if Janet Andrews
suspected it she held her tonguean art in which she excelled She saw
no harm in a fiddle herself and thought Mr Leonard absurdly strict
in the matter though it would not have been well for the luckless
outsider who might have ventured to say as much to her She had connived
at Felixs visits to old Abel Blair squaring the matter with her
Presbyterian conscience by some peculiar process known only to herself

When Janet heard of the promise which Mr Leonard had exacted from Felix
she seethed with indignation and though she knew her place better
than to say anything to Mr Leonard about it she made her disapproval
so plainly manifest in her bearing that the stern gentle old man found
the atmosphere of his hitherto peaceful manse unpleasantly chill and
hostile for a time

It was the wish of his heart that Felix should be a minister as he
would have wished his own son to be had one been born to him Mr
Leonard thought rightly that the highest work to which any man could be
called was a life of service to his fellows but he made the mistake of
supposing the field of service much narrower than it isof failing to
see that a man may minister to the needs of humanity in many different
but equally effective ways



Janet hoped that Mr Leonard might not exact the fulfilment of Felixs
promise but Felix himself with the instinctive understanding of
perfect love knew that it was vain to hope for any change of viewpoint
in his grandfather He addressed himself to the keeping of his promise
in letter and in spirit He never went again to old Abels he did not
even play on the organ though this was not forbidden because any
music wakened in him a passion of longing and ecstasy which demanded
expression with an intensity not to be borne He flung himself grimly
into his studies and conned Latin and Greek verbs with a persistency
which soon placed him at the head of all competitors

Only once in the long winter did he come near to breaking his promise
One evening when March was melting into April and the pulses of spring
were stirring under the lingering snow he was walking home from school
alone As he descended into the little hollow below the manse a lively
lilt of music drifted up to meet him It was only the product of a
mouthorgan manipulated by a little blackeyed FrenchCanadian hired
boy sitting on the fence by the brook but there was music in the
ragged urchin and it came out through his simple toy It tingled over
Felix from head to foot and when Leon held out the mouthorgan with a
fraternal grin of invitation he snatched at it as a famished creature
might snatch at food

Then with it halfway to his lips he paused True it was only the
violin he had promised never to touch but he felt that if he gave way
ever so little to the desire that was in him it would sweep everything
before it If he played on Leon Buotes mouthorgan there in that misty
spring dale he would go to old Abels that evening he KNEW he would
go To Leons amazement Felix threw the mouthorgan back at him and
ran up the hill as if he were pursued There was something in his boyish
face that frightened Leon and it frightened Janet Andrews as Felix
rushed past her in the hall of the manse

Child whats the matter with you she cried Are you sick Have you
been scared

No no Leave me alone Janet said Felix chokingly dashing up the
stairs to his own room

He was quite composed when he came down to tea an hour later though he
was unusually pale and had purple shadows under his large eyes

Mr Leonard scrutinized him somewhat anxiously it suddenly occurred to
the old minister that Felix was looking more delicate than his wont
this spring Well he had studied hard all winter and he was certainly
growing very fast When vacation came he must be sent away for a visit

They tell me Naomi Clark is real sick said Janet She has been
ailing all winter and now shes fast to her bed Mrs Murphy says she
believes the woman is dying but nobody dares tell her so She wont
give in shes sick nor take medicine And theres nobody to wait on her
except that simple creature Maggie Peterson

I wonder if I ought to go and see her said Mr Leonard uneasily

What use would it be to bother yourself You know she wouldnt see
youshed shut the door in your face like she did before Shes an
awful wicked womanbut its kind of terrible to think of her lying
there sick with no responsible person to tend her

Naomi Clark is a bad woman and she lived a life of shame but I like
her for all that remarked Felix in the grave meditative tone in
which he occasionally said rather startling things

Mr Leonard looked somewhat reproachfully at Janet Andrews as if to ask
her why Felix should have attained to this dubious knowledge of good
and evil under her care and Janet shot a dour look back which being
interpreted meant that if Felix went to the district school she could
not and would not be held responsible if he learned more there than
arithmetic and Latin

What do you know of Naomi Clark to like or dislike she asked
curiously Did you ever see her

Oh yes Felix replied addressing himself to his cherry preserve with
considerable gusto I was down at Spruce Cove one night last summer
when a big thunderstorm came up I went to Naomis house for shelter
The door was open so I walked right in because nobody answered my
knock Naomi Clark was at the window watching the cloud coming up over
the sea She just looked at me once but didnt say anything and then
went on watching the cloud I didnt like to sit down because she hadnt
asked me to so I went to the window by her and watched it too It was
a dreadful sightthe cloud was so black and the water so green and
there was such a strange light between the cloud and the water yet
there was something splendid in it too Part of the time I watched the
storm and the other part I watched Naomis face It was dreadful to
see like the storm and yet I liked to see it

After the thunder was over it rained a while longer and Naomi sat down
and talked to me She asked me who I was and when I told her she asked
me to play something for her on her violinFelix shot a deprecating
glance at Mr Leonardbecause she said shed heard I was a great
hand at it She wanted something lively and I tried just as hard as I
could to play something like that But I couldnt I played something
that was terribleit just played itselfit seemed as if something was
lost that could never be found again And before I got through Naomi
came at me and tore the violin from me andSWORE And she said You
bigeyed brat how did you know THAT Then she took me by the armand
she hurt me too I can tell youand she put me right out in the rain
and slammed the door

The rude unmannerly creature said Janet indignantly

Oh no she was quite in the right said Felix composedly It served
me right for what I played You see she didnt know I couldnt help
playing it I suppose she thought I did it on purpose

What on earth did you play child

I dont know Felix shivered It was awfulit was dreadful It was
fit to break your heart But it HAD to be played if I played anything at
all

I dont understand what you meanI declare I dont said Janet in
bewilderment

I think well change the subject of conversation said Mr Leonard



It was a month later when the simple creature Maggie appeared at the
manse door one evening and asked for the preached

Naomi wants ter see yer she mumbled Naomi sent Maggie ter tell yer
ter come at onct

I shall go certainly said Mr Leonard gently Is she very ill

Hers dying said Maggie with a broad grin And hers awful skeered
of hell Her just knew terday her was dying Maggie told herher
wouldnt believe the harbour women but her believed Maggie Her yelled
awful

Maggie chuckled to herself over the gruesome remembrance Mr Leonard
his heart filled with pity called Janet and told her to give the poor
creature some refreshment But Maggie shook her head

No no preacher Maggie must get right back to Naomi Maggiell tell
her the preachers coming ter save her from hell

She uttered an eerie cry and ran at full speed shoreward through the
spruce woods

The Lord save us said Janet in an awed tone I knew the poor girl
was simple but I didnt know she was like THAT And are you going
sir

Yes of course I pray God I may be able to help the poor soul said
Mr Leonard sincerely He was a man who never shirked what he believed
to be his duty but duty had sometimes presented itself to him in
pleasanter guise than this summons to Naomi Clarks deathbed

The woman had been the plague spot of Lower Carmody and Carmody
Harbour for a generation In the earlier days of his ministry to the
congregation he had tried to reclaim her and Naomi had mocked and
flouted him to his face Then for the sake of those to whom she was
a snare or a heartbreak he had endeavoured to set the law in motion
against her and Naomi had laughed the law to scorn Finally he had
been compelled to let her alone

Yet Naomi had not always been an outcast Her girlhood had been
innocent but she was the possessor of a dangerous beauty and her
mother was dead Her father was a man notorious for his harshness and
violence of temper When Naomi made the fatal mistake of trusting to a
false love that betrayed and deserted he drove her from his door with
taunts and curses

Naomi took up her quarters in a little deserted house at Spruce Cove
Had her child lived it might have saved her But it died at birth and
with its little life went her last chance of worldly redemption From
that time forth her feet were set in the way that takes hold on hell

For the past five years however Naomi had lived a tolerably
respectable life When Janet Peterson had died her idiot daughter
Maggie had been left with no kin in the world Nobody knew what was to
be done with her for nobody wanted to be bothered with her Naomi Clark
went to the girl and offered her a home People said she was no fit
person to have charge of Maggie but everybody shirked the unpleasant
task of interfering in the matter except Mr Leonard who went to
expostulate with Naomi and as Janet said for his pains got her door
shut in his face

But from the day when Maggie Peterson went to live with her Naomi
ceased to be the harbour Magdalen



The sun had set when Mr Leonard reached Spruce Cove and the harbour
was veiling itself in a wondrous twilight splendour Afar out the
sea lay throbbing and purple and the moan of the bar came through the
sweet chill spring air with its burden of hopeless endless longing and
seeking The sky was blossoming into stars above the afterglow out
to the east the moon was rising and the sea beneath it was a thing of
radiance and silver and glamour and a little harbour boat that went
sailing across it was transmuted into an elfin shallop from the coast of
fairyland

Mr Leonard sighed as he turned from the sinless beauty of the sea and
sky to the threshold of Naomi Clarks house It was very smallone room
below and a sleepingloft above but a bed had been made up for the
sick woman by the downstairs window looking out on the harbour and
Naomi lay on it with a lamp burning at her head and another at her
side although it was not yet dark A great dread of darkness had always
been one of Naomis peculiarities

She was tossing restlessly on her poor couch while Maggie crouched on a
box at the foot Mr Leonard had not seen her for five years and he
was shocked at the change in her She was much wasted her clearcut
aquiline features had been of the type which becomes indescribably
witchlike in old age and though Naomi Clark was barely sixty she
looked as if she might be a hundred Her hair streamed over the pillow
in white uncaredfor tresses and the hands that plucked at the
bedclothes were like wrinkled claws Only her eyes were unchanged they
were as blue and brilliant as ever but now filled with such agonized
terror and appeal that Mr Leonards gentle heart almost stood still
with the horror of them They were the eyes of a creature driven wild
with torture hounded by furies clutched by unutterable fear

Naomi sat up and dragged at his arm

Can you help me Can you help me she gasped imploringly Oh I
thought youd never come I was skeered Id die before you got heredie
and go to hell I didnt know before today that I was dying None of
those cowards would tell me Can you help me

If I cannot God can said Mr Leonard gently He felt himself very
helpless and inefficient before this awful terror and frenzy He had
seen sad deathbedstroubled deathbedsay and despairing deathbeds
but never anything like this God Naomis voice shrilled terribly as
she uttered the name I cant go to God for help Oh Im skeered of
hell but Im skeereder still of God Id rather go to hell a thousand
times over than face God after the life Ive lived I tell you Im
sorry for living wickedI was always sorry for it all the time There
aint never been a moment I wasnt sorry though nobody would believe
it I was driven on by fiends of hell Oh you dont understandyou
CANT understandbut I was always sorry

If you repent that is all that is necessary God will forgive you if
you ask Him

No He cant Sins like mine cant be forgiven He cantand He
wont

He can and He will He is a God of love Naomi

No said Naomi with stubborn conviction He isnt a God of love at
all Thats why Im skeered of him No no Hes a God of wrath and
justice and punishment Love There aint no such thing as love Ive
never found it on earth and I dont believe its to be found in God

Naomi God loves us like a father

Like MY father Naomis shrill laughter pealing through the still
room was hideous to hear

The old minister shuddered

Nono As a kind tender allwise father Naomias you would have
loved your little child if it had lived

Naomi cowered and moaned

Oh I wish I could believe THAT I wouldnt be frightened if I could
believe that MAKE me believe it Surely you can make me believe that
theres love and forgiveness in God if you believe it yourself

Jesus Christ forgave and loved the Magdalen Naomi

Jesus Christ Oh I aint afraid of HIM Yes HE could understand and
forgive He was half human I tell you its God Im skeered of

They are one and the same said Mr Leonard helplessly He knew he
could not make Naomi realize it This anguished deathbed was no place
for a theological exposition on the mysteries of the Trinity

Christ died for you Naomi He bore your sins in His own body on the
cross

We bear our own sins said Naomi fiercely Ive borne mine all my
lifeand Ill bear them for all eternity I cant believe anything
else I CANT believe God can forgive me Ive ruined people body and
soulIve broken hearts and poisoned homesIm worse than a murderess
Nonono theres no hope for me Her voice rose again into that
shrill intolerable shriek Ive got to go to hell It aint so much
the fire Im skeered of as the outer darkness Ive always been so
skeered of darknessits so full of awful things and thoughts Oh
there aint nobody to help me Man aint no good and Im too skeered of
God

She wrung her hands Mr Leonard walked up and down the room in the
keenest anguish of spirit he had ever known What could he do What
could he say There was healing and peace in his religion for this woman
as for all others but he could express it in no language which this
tortured soul could understand He looked at her writhing face he
looked at the idiot girl chuckling to herself at the foot of the bed
he looked through the open door to the remote starlit nightand
a horrible sense of utter helplessness overcame him He could do
nothingnothing In all his life he had never known such bitterness of
soul as the realization brought home to him

What is the good of you if you cant help me moaned the dying woman
Praypraypray she shrilled suddenly

Mr Leonard dropped on his knees by the bed He did not know what
to say No prayer that he had ever prayed was of use here The old
beautiful formulas which had soothed and helped the passing of many a
soul were naught save idle empty words to Naomi Clark In his anguish
of mind Stephen Leonard gasped out the briefest and sincerest prayer his
lips had ever uttered

O God our Father Help this woman Speak to her in a tongue which she
can understand



A beautiful white face appeared for a moment in the light that streamed
out of the doorway into the darkness of the night No one noticed it
and it quickly drew back into the shadow Suddenly Naomi fell back on
her pillow her lips blue her face horribly pinched her eyes rolled up
in her head Maggie started up pushed Mr Leonard aside and proceeded
to administer some remedy with surprising skill and deftness Mr
Leonard believing Naomi to be dying went to the door feeling sick and
bruised in soul

Presently a figure stole out into the light

Felix is that you said Mr Leonard in a startled tone

Yes sir Felix came up to the stone step Janet got frightened that
you might fall on that rough road after dark so she made me come after
you with a lantern Ive been waiting behind the point but at last I
thought Id better come and see if you would be staying much longer If
you will be Ill go back to Janet and leave the lantern here with you
Yes that will be the best thing to do I may not be ready to go home
for some time yet said Mr Leonard thinking that the deathbed of sin
behind him was no sight for Felixs young eyes

Is that your grandson youre talking to Naomi spoke clearly and
strongly The spasm had passed If it is bring him in I want to see
him

Reluctantly Mr Leonard signed Felix to enter The boy stood by Naomis
bed and looked down at her with sympathetic eyes But at first she did
not look at himshe looked past him at the minister

I might have died in that spell she said with sullen reproach in her
voice and if I had Id been in hell now You cant help meIm done
with you There aint any hope for me and I know it now

She turned to Felix

Take down that fiddle on the wall and play something for me she said
imperiously Im dyingand Im going to helland I dont want to
think of it Play me something to take my thoughts off itI dont care
what you play I was always fond of musicthere was always something in
it for me I never found anywhere else

Felix looked at his grandfather The old man nodded he felt too ashamed
to speak he sat with his fine silver head in his hands while Felix
took down and tuned the old violin on which so many godless lilts had
been played in many a wild revel Mr Leonard felt that he had failed
his religion He could not give Naomi the help that was in it for her

Felix drew the bow softly perplexedly over the strings He had no
idea what he should play Then his eyes were caught and held by Naomis
burning mesmeric blue gaze as she lay on her crumpled pillow A
strange inspired look came over the boys face He began to play as if
it were not he who played but some mightier power of which he was but
the passive instrument

Sweet and soft and wonderful was the music that stole through the
room Mr Leonard forgot his heartbreak and listened to it in puzzled
amazement He had never heard anything like it before How could the
child play like that He looked at Naomi and marvelled at the change
in her face The fear and frenzy were going out of it she listened
breathlessly never taking her eyes from Felix At the foot of the bed
the idiot girl sat with tears on her cheeks

In that strange music was the joy of the innocent mirthful childhood
blent with the laughter of waves and the call of glad winds Then it
held the wild wayward dreams of youth sweet and pure in all their
wildness and waywardness They were followed by a rapture of young
loveallsurrendering allsacrificing love The music changed It
held the torture of unshed tears the anguish of a heart deceived and
desolate Mr Leonard almost put his hands over his ears to shut out its
intolerable poignancy But on the dying womans face was only a strange
relief as if some dumb longhidden pain had at last won to the healing
of utterance

The sullen indifference of despair came next the bitterness of
smouldering revolt and misery the reckless casting away of all good
There was something indescribably evil in the music nowso evil that
Mr Leonards white soul shuddered away in loathing and Maggie cowered
and whined like a frightened animal

Again the music changed And in it now there was agony and fearand
repentance and a cry for pardon To Mr Leonard there was something
strangely familiar in it He struggled to recall where he had heard
it before then he suddenly knewhe had heard it before Felix came in
Naomis terrible words He looked at his grandson with something like
awe Here was a power of which he knew nothinga strange and dreadful
power Was it of God Or of Satan

For the last time the music changed And now it was not music at allit
was a great infinite forgiveness an allcomprehending love It was
healing for a sick soul it was light and hope and peace A Bible text
seemingly incongruous came into Mr Leonards mindThis is the house
of God this is the gate of heaven

Felix lowered the violin and dropped wearily on a chair by the bed The
inspired light faded from his face once more he was only a tired boy
But Stephen Leonard was on his knees sobbing like a child and Naomi
Clark was lying still with her hands clasped over her breast

I understand now she said very softly I couldnt see it beforeand
now its so plain I just FEEL it God IS a God of love He can forgive
anybodyeven meeven me He knows all about it I aint skeered any
more He just loves me and forgives me as Id have loved and forgiven
my baby if shed lived no matter how bad she was or what she did The
minister told me that but I couldnt believe it I KNOW it now And He
sent you here tonight boy to tell it to me in a way that I could feel
it



Naomi Clark died just as the dawn came up over the sea Mr Leonard rose
from his watch at her bedside and went to the door Before him spread
the harbour gray and austere in the faint light but afar out the sun
was rending asunder the milkwhite mists in which the sea was scarfed
and under it was a virgin glow of sparkling water

The fir trees on the point moved softly and whispered together The
whole world sang of spring and resurrection and life and behind him
Naomi Clarks dead face took on the peace that passes understanding

The old minister and his grandson walked home together in a silence that
neither wished to break Janet Andrews gave them a good scolding and an
excellent breakfast Then she ordered them both to bed but Mr Leonard
smiling at her said

Presently Janet presently But now take this key go up to the black
chest in the garret and bring me what you will find there

When Janet had gone he turned to Felix

Felix would you like to study music as your lifework

Felix looked up with a transfiguring flush on his wan face

Oh grandfather Oh grandfather

You may do so my child After this night I dare not hinder you Go
with my blessing and may God guide and keep you and make you strong to
do His work and tell His message to humanity in your own appointed way
It is not the way I desired for youbut I see that I was mistaken Old
Abel spoke truly when he said there was a Christ in your violin as well
as a devil I understand what he meant now

He turned to meet Janet who came into the study with a violin Felixs
heart throbbed he recognized it Mr Leonard took it from Janet and
held it out to the boy

This is your fathers violin Felix See to it that you never make
your music the servant of the power of evilnever debase it to unworthy
ends For your responsibility is as your gift and God will exact the
accounting of it from you Speak to the world in your own tongue through
it with truth and sincerity and all I have hoped for you will be
abundantly fulfilled





IV Little Joscelyn


It simply isnt to be thought of Aunty Nan said Mrs William
Morrison decisively Mrs William Morrison was one of those people who
always speak decisively If they merely announce that they are going
to peel the potatoes for dinner their hearers realize that there is
no possible escape for the potatoes Moreover these people are always
given their full title by everybody William Morrison was called Billy
oftener than not but if you had asked for Mrs Billy Morrison nobody
in Avonlea would have known what you meant at first guess

You must see that for yourself Aunty went on Mrs William hulling
strawberries nimbly with her large firm white fingers as she talked
Mrs William always improved every shining moment It is ten miles to
Kensington and just think how late you would be getting back You are
not able for such a drive You wouldnt get over it for a month You
know you are anything but strong this summer

Aunty Nan sighed and patted the tiny furry gray morsel of a kitten in
her lap with trembling fingers She knew better than anyone else could
know it that she was not strong that summer In her secret soul Aunty
Nan sweet and frail and timid under the burden of her seventy years
felt with mysterious unmistakable prescience that it was to be her last
summer at the Gull Point Farm But that was only the more reason why
she should go to hear little Joscelyn sing she would never have another
chance And oh to hear little Joscelyn sing just onceJoscelyn whose
voice was delighting thousands out in the big world just as in the
years gone by it had delighted Aunty Nan and the dwellers at the Gull
Point Farm for a whole golden summer with carols at dawn and dusk about
the old place

Oh I know Im not very strong Maria said Aunty Nan pleadingly but
I am strong enough for that Indeed I am I could stay at Kensington
over night with Georges folks you know and so it wouldnt tire
me much I do so want to hear Joscelyn sing Oh how I love little
Joscelyn

It passes my understanding the way you hanker after that child cried
Mrs William impatiently Why she was a perfect stranger to you when
she came here and she was here only one summer

But oh such a summer said Aunty Nan softly We all loved little
Joscelyn She just seemed like one of our own She was one of Gods
children carrying love with them everywhere In some ways that little
Anne Shirley the Cuthberts have got up there at Green Gables reminds
me of her though in other ways theyre not a bit alike Joscelyn was a
beauty

Well that Shirley snippet certainly isnt that said Mrs William
sarcastically And if Joscelyns tongue was one third as long as Anne
Shirleys the wonder to me is that she didnt talk you all to death out
of hand

Little Joscelyn wasnt much of a talker said Aunty Nan dreamily She
was kind of a quiet child But you remember what she did say And Ive
never forgotten little Joscelyn

Mrs William shrugged her plump shapely shoulders

Well it was fifteen years ago Aunty Nan and Joscelyn cant be very
little now She is a famous woman and she has forgotten all about
you you can be sure of that

Joscelyn wasnt the kind that forgets said Aunty Nan loyally And
anyway the point is _I_ havent forgotten HER Oh Maria Ive longed
for years and years just to hear her sing once more It seems as if I
MUST hear my little Joscelyn sing once again before I die Ive never
had the chance before and I never will have it again Do please ask
William to take me to Kensington

Dear me Aunty Nan this is really childish said Mrs William
whisking her bowlful of berries into the pantry You must let other
folks be the judge of what is best for you now You arent strong enough
to drive to Kensington and even if you were you know well enough that
William couldnt go to Kensington tomorrow night He has got to attend
that political meeting at Newbridge They cant do without him

Jordan could take me to Kensington pleaded Aunty Nan with very
unusual persistence

Nonsense You couldnt go to Kensington with the hired man Now Aunty
Nan do be reasonable Arent William and I kind to you Dont we do
everything for your comfort

Yes oh yes admitted Aunty Nan deprecatingly

Well then you ought to be guided by our opinion And you must just
give up thinking about the Kensington concert Aunty and not worry
yourself and me about it any more I am going down to the shore field
now to call William to tea Just keep an eye on the baby in chance he
wakes up and see that the teapot doesnt boil over

Mrs William whisked out of the kitchen pretending not to see the tears
that were falling over Aunty Nans withered pink cheeks Aunty Nan was
really getting very childish Mrs William reflected as she marched
down to the shore field Why she cried now about every little
thing And such a notionto want to go to the Old Timers concert at
Kensington and be so set on it Really it was hard to put up with her
whims Mrs William sighed virtuously

As for Aunty Nan she sat alone in the kitchen and cried bitterly as
only lonely old age can cry It seemed to her that she could not bear
it that she MUST go to Kensington But she knew that it was not to be
since Mrs William had decided otherwise Mrs Williams word was law at
Gull Point Farm

Whats the matter with my old Aunty Nan cried a hearty young voice
from the doorway Jordan Sloane stood there his round freckled face
looking as anxious and sympathetic as it was possible for such a very
round very freckled face to look Jordan was the Morrisons hired boy
that summer and he worshipped Aunty Nan

Oh Jordan sobbed Aunty Nan who was not above telling her troubles
to the hired help although Mrs William thought she ought to be I
cant go to Kensington tomorrow night to hear little Joscelyn sing at
the Old Timers concert Maria says I cant

Thats too bad said Jordan Old cat he muttered after the
retreating and serenely unconscious Mrs William Then he shambled in
and sat down on the sofa beside Aunty Nan

There there dont cry he said patting her thin little shoulder
with his big sunburned paw Youll make yourself sick if you go on
crying and we cant get along without you at Gull Point Farm

Aunty Nan smiled wanly

Im afraid youll soon have to get on without me Jordan Im not going
to be here very long now No Im not Jordan I know it Something
tells me so very plainly But I would be willing to goglad to go for
Im very tired Jordanif I could only have heard little Joscelyn sing
once more

Why are you so set on hearing her asked Jordan She aint no kin to
you is she

No but dearer to medearer to me than many of my own Maria thinks
that is silly but you wouldnt if youd known her Jordan Even Maria
herself wouldnt if she had known her It is fifteen years since she
came here one summer to board She was a child of thirteen then and
hadnt any relations except an old uncle who sent her to school in
winter and boarded her out in summer and didnt care a rap about her
The child was just starving for love Jordan and she got it here
William and his brothers were just children then and they hadnt
any sister We all just worshipped her She was so sweet Jordan And
pretty oh my like a little girl in a picture with great long curls
all black and purply and fine as spun silk and big dark eyes and such
pink cheeksreal wild rose cheeks And sing My land But couldnt she
sing Always singing every hour of the day that voice was ringing round
the old place I used to hold my breath to hear it She always said that
she meant to be a famous singer some day and I never doubted it a mite
It was born in her Sunday evening she used to sing hymns for us Oh
Jordan it makes my old heart young again to remember it A sweet child
she was my little Joscelyn She used to write me for three or four
years after she went away but I havent heard a word from her for long
and long I daresay she has forgotten me as Maria says Twouldnt be
any wonder But I havent forgotten her and oh I want to see and hear
her terrible much She is to sing at the Old Timers concert tomorrow
night at Kensington The folks who are getting the concert up are
friends of hers or of course shed never have come to a little
country village Only sixteen miles awayand I cant go

Jordan couldnt think of anything to say He reflected savagely that if
he had a horse of his own he would take Aunty Nan to Kensington Mrs
William or no Mrs William Though to be sure it WAS a long drive for
her and she was looking very frail this summer

Aint going to last long muttered Jordan making his escape by the
porch door as Mrs William puffed in by the other The sweetest old
creetur that ever was createdll go when she goes Yah ye old madam
Id like to give you a piece of my mind that I would

This last was for Mrs William but was delivered in a prudent
undertone Jordan detested Mrs William but she was a power to be
reckoned with all the same Meek easygoing Billy Morrison did just
what his wife told him to

So Aunty Nan did not get to Kensington to hear little Joscelyn sing She
said nothing more about it but after that night she seemed to fail very
rapidly Mrs William said it was the hot weather and that Aunty Nan
gave way too easily But Aunty Nan could not help giving way now she
was very very tired Even her knitting wearied her She would sit for
hours in her rocking chair with the gray kitten in her lap looking out
of the window with dreamy unseeing eyes She talked to herself a good
deal generally about little Joscelyn Mrs William told Avonlea folk
that Aunty Nan had got terribly childish and always accompanied the
remark with a sigh that intimated how much she Mrs William had to
contend with

Justice must be done to Mrs William however She was not unkind to
Aunty Nan on the contrary she was very kind to her in the letter Her
comfort was scrupulously attended to and Mrs William had the grace to
utter none of her complaints in the old womans hearing If Aunty Nan
felt the absence of the spirit she never murmured at it

One day when the Avonlea slopes were goldenhued with the ripened
harvest Aunty Nan did not get up She complained of nothing but great
weariness Mrs William remarked to her husband that if SHE lay in bed
every day she felt tired there wouldnt be much done at Gull Point
Farm But she prepared an excellent breakfast and carried it patiently
up to Aunty Nan who ate little of it

After dinner Jordan crept up by way of the back stairs to see her Aunty
Nan was lying with her eyes fixed on the pale pink climbing roses that
nodded about the window When she saw Jordan she smiled

Them roses put me so much in mind of little Joscelyn she said softly
She loved them so If I could only see her Oh Jordan if I could only
see her Maria says its terrible childish to be always harping on that
string and mebbe it is Butoh Jordan theres such a hunger in my
heart for her such a hunger

Jordan felt a queer sensation in his throat and twisted his ragged
straw hat about in his big hands Just then a vague idea which had
hovered in his brain all day crystallized into decision But all he said
was

I hope youll feel better soon Aunty Nan

Oh yes Jordan dear Ill be better soon said Aunty Nan with her own
sweet smile The inhabitant shall not say I am sick you know But if
I could only see little Joscelyn first

Jordan went out and hurried downstairs Billy Morrison was in the
stable when Jordan stuck his head over the halfdoor

Say can I have the rest of the day off sir I want to go to
Kensington

Well I dont mind said Billy Morrison amiably Mays well get you
jaunting done fore harvest comes on And here Jord take this quarter
and get some oranges for Aunty Nan Neednt mention it to headquarters

Billy Morrisons face was solemn but Jordan winked as he pocketed the
money

If Ive any luck Ill bring her something thatll do her more good
than the oranges he muttered as he hurried off to the pasture Jordan
had a horse of his own now a rather bony nag answering to the name of
Dan Billy Morrison had agreed to pasture the animal if Jordan used
him in the farm work an arrangement scoffed at by Mrs William in no
measured terms

Jordan hitched Dan into the second best buggy dressed himself in his
Sunday clothes and drove off On the road he reread a paragraph he had
clipped from the Charlottetown Daily Enterprise of the previous day

Joscelyn Burnett the famous contralto is spending a few days in
Kensington on her return from her Maritime concert tour She is the
guest of Mr and Mrs Bromley of The Beeches

Now if I can get there in time said Jordan emphatically

Jordan got to Kensington put Dan up in a livery stable and inquired
the way to The Beeches He felt rather nervous when he found it it was
such a stately imposing place set back from the street in an emerald
green seclusion of beautiful grounds

Fancy me stalking up to that front door and asking for Miss Joscelyn
Burnett grinned Jordan sheepishly Mebbe theyll tell me to go around
to the back and inquire for the cook But youre going just the same
Jordan Sloane and no skulking March right up now Think of Aunty Nan
and dont let style down you

A pertlooking maid answered Jordans ring and stared at him when he
asked for Miss Burnett

I dont think you can see her she said shortly scanning his country
cut of hair and clothes rather superciliously What is your business
with her

The maids scorn roused Jordans dander as he would have expressed
it

Ill tell her that when I see her he retorted coolly Just you tell
her that Ive a message for her from Aunty Nan Morrison of Gull Point
Farm Avonlea If she haint forgot thatll fetch her You might as
well hurry up if you please Ive not overly too much time

The pert maid decided to be civil at least and invited Jordan to enter
But she left him standing in the hall while she went in search of Miss
Burnett Jordan gazed about him in amazement He had never been in any
place like this before The hall was wonderful enough and through the
open doors on either hand stretched vistas of lovely rooms that to
Jordans eyes looked like those of a palace

Gee whiz How do they ever move around without knocking things over

Then Joscelyn Burnett came and Jordan forgot everything else This
tall beautiful woman in her silken draperies with a face like nothing
Jordan had ever seen or even dreamed aboutcould this be Aunty Nans
little Joscelyn Jordans round freckled countenance grew crimson He
felt horribly tonguetied and embarrassed What could he say to her How
could he say it

Joscelyn Burnett looked at him with her large dark eyesthe eyes of a
woman who had suffered much and learned much and won through struggle
to victory

You have come from Aunty Nan she said Oh I am so glad to hear from
her Is she well Come in here and tell me all about her

She turned toward one of those fairylike rooms but Jordan interrupted
her desperately

Oh not in there maam Id never get it out Just let me blunder
through it out here someways Yesm Aunty Nan she aint very well
Shesshes dying I guess And shes longing for you night and day
Seems as if she couldnt die in peace without seeing you She wanted
to get to Kensington to hear you sing but that old cat of a Mrs
Williambegging you pardon maamwouldnt let her come Shes always
talking of you If you can come out to Gull Point Farm and see her Ill
be most awful obliged to you maam

Joscelyn Burnett looked troubled She had not forgotten Gull Point Farm
nor Aunty Nan but for years the memory had been dim crowded into the
background of consciousness by the more exciting events of her busy
life Now it came back with a rush She recalled it all tenderlythe
peace and beauty and love of that olden summer and sweet Aunty Nan so
very wise in the lore of all things simple and good and true For the
moment Joscelyn Burnett was a lonely hungryhearted little girl again
seeking for love and finding it not until Aunty Nan had taken her into
her great motherheart and taught her its meaning

Oh I dont know she said perplexedly If you had come soonerI
leave on the 1130 train tonight I MUST leave by then or I shall not
reach Montreal in time to fill a very important engagement And yet I
must see Aunty Nan too I have been careless and neglectful I might
have gone to see her before How can we manage it

Ill bring you back to Kensington in time to catch that train said
Jordan eagerly Theres nothing I wouldnt do for Aunty Nanme and
Dan Yes sir youll get back in time Just think of Aunty Nans face
when she sees you

I will come said the great singer gently

It was sunset when they reached Gull Point Farm An arc of warm gold
was over the spruces behind the house Mrs William was out in the
barnyard milking and the house was deserted save for the sleeping
baby in the kitchen and the little old woman with the watchful eyes in
the upstairs room

This way maam said Jordan inwardly congratulating himself that the
coast was clear Ill take you right up to her room

Upstairs Joscelyn tapped at the halfopen door and went in Before
it closed behind her Jordan heard Aunty Nan say Joscelyn Little
Joscelyn in a tone that made him choke again He stumbled thankfully
downstairs to be pounced upon by Mrs William in the kitchen

Jordan Sloane who was that stylish woman you drove into the yard with
And what have you done with her

That was Miss Joscelyn Burnett said Jordan expanding himself This
was his hour of triumph over Mrs William I went to Kensington and
brung her out to see Aunty Nan Shes up with her now

Dear me said Mrs William helplessly And me in my milking rig
Jordan for pitys sake hold the baby while I go and put on my black
silk You might have given a body some warning I declare I dont know
which is the greatest idiot you or Aunty Nan

As Mrs William flounced out of the kitchen Jordan took his
satisfaction in a quiet laugh

Upstairs in the little room was a great glory of sunset and gladness
of human hearts Joscelyn was kneeling by the bed with her arms about
Aunty Nan and Aunty Nan with her face all irradiated was stroking
Joscelyns dark hair fondly

O little Joscelyn she murmured it seems too good to be true It
seems like a beautiful dream I knew you the minute you opened the door
my dearie You havent changed a bit And youre a famous singer now
little Joscelyn I always knew you would be Oh I want you to sing a
piece for mejust one wont you dearie Sing that piece people like
to hear you sing best I forget the name but Ive read about it in the
papers Sing it for me little Joscelyn

And Joscelyn standing by Aunty Nans bed in the sunset light sang
the song she had sung to many a brilliant audience on many a noted
concertplatformsang it as even she had never sung before while Aunty
Nan lay and listened beatifically and downstairs even Mrs William held
her breath entranced by the exquisite melody that floated through the
old farmhouse

O little Joscelyn breathed Aunty Nan in rapture when the song
ended

Joscelyn knelt by her again and they had a long talk of old days One by
one they recalled the memories of that vanished summer The past gave up
its tears and its laughter Heart and fancy alike went roaming through
the ways of the long ago Aunty Nan was perfectly happy And then
Joscelyn told her all the story of her struggles and triumphs since they
had parted

When the moonlight began to creep in through the low window Aunty Nan
put out her hand and touched Joscelyns bowed head

Little Joscelyn she whispered if it aint asking too much I want
you to sing just one other piece Do you remember when you were here how
we sung hymns in the parlour every Sunday night and my favourite always
was The Sands of Time are Sinking I aint never forgot how you used
to sing that and I want to hear it just once again dearie Sing it for
me little Joscelyn

Joscelyn rose and went to the window Lifting back the curtain she
stood in the splendour of the moonlight and sang the grand old hymn
At first Aunty Nan beat time to it feebly on the counterpane but when
Joscelyn came to the verse With mercy and with judgment she folded
her hands over her breast and smiled

When the hymn ended Joscelyn came over to the bed

I am afraid I must say goodbye now Aunty Nan she said

Then she saw that Aunty Nan had fallen asleep She would not waken her
but she took from her breast the cluster of crimson roses she wore and
slipped them gently between the toilworn fingers

Goodbye dear sweet motherheart she murmured

Downstairs she met Mrs William splendid in rustling black silk her
broad rubicund face smiling overflowing with apologies and welcomes
which Joscelyn cut short coldly

Thank you Mrs Morrison but I cannot possibly stay longer No thank
you I dont care for any refreshments Jordan is going to take me back
to Kensington at once I came out to see Aunty Nan Im certain shed
be delighted said Mrs William effusively Shes been talking about
you for weeks

Yes it has made her very happy said Joscelyn gravely And it has
made me happy too I love Aunty Nan Mrs Morrison and I owe her much
In all my life I have never met a woman so purely unselfishly good and
noble and true

Fancy now said Mrs William rather overcome at hearing this great
singer pronounce such an encomium on quiet timid old Aunty Nan

Jordan drove Joscelyn back to Kensington and upstairs in her room
Aunty Nan slept with that rapt smile on her face and Joscelyns red
roses in her hands Thus it was that Mrs William found her going in
the next morning with her breakfast The sunlight crept over the pillow
lighting up the sweet old face and silver hair and stealing downward
to the faded red roses on her breast Smiling and peaceful and happy
lay Aunty Nan for she had fallen on the sleep that knows no earthy
wakening while little Joscelyn sang





V The Winning of Lucinda


The marriage of a Penhallow was always the signal for a gathering of
the Penhallows From the uttermost parts of the earth they would
comePenhallows by birth and Penhallows by marriage and Penhallows
by ancestry East Grafton was the ancient habitat of the race and
Penhallow Grange where old John Penhallow lived was a Mecca to them

As for the family itself the exact kinship of all its various branches
and ramifications was a hard thing to define Old Uncle Julius Penhallow
was looked upon as a veritable wonder because he carried it all in his
head and could tell on sight just what relation any one Penhallow was
to any other Penhallow The rest made a blind guess at it for the most
part and the younger Penhallows let it go at loose cousinship

In this instance it was Alice Penhallow daughter of young John
Penhallow who was to be married Alice was a nice girl but she and
her wedding only pertain to this story in so far as they furnish a
background for Lucinda hence nothing more need be said of her

On the afternoon of her wedding daythe Penhallows held to the
good oldfashioned custom of evening weddings with a rousing dance
afterwardsPenhallow Grange was filled to overflowing with guests who
had come there to have tea and rest themselves before going down to
young Johns Many of them had driven fifty miles In the big
autumnal orchard the younger fry foregathered and chatted and coquetted
Upstairs in old Mrs Johns bedroom she and her married daughters
held high conclave Old John had established himself with his sons and
sonsinlaw in the parlour and the three daughtersinlaw were making
themselves at home in the blue sittingroom eardeep in harmless family
gossip Lucinda and Romney Penhallow were also there

Thin Mrs Nathaniel Penhallow sat in a rocking chair and toasted her
toes at the grate for the brilliant autumn afternoon was slightly
chilly and Lucinda as usual had the window open She and plump Mrs
Frederick Penhallow did most of the talking Mrs George Penhallow being
rather out of it by reason of her newness She was George Penhallows
second wife married only a year Hence her contributions to the
conversation were rather spasmodic hurled in as it were by dead
reckoning being sometimes appropriate and sometimes savouring of a
point of view not strictly Penhallowesque

Romney Penhallow was sitting in a corner listening to the chatter of
the women with the inscrutable smile that always vexed Mrs Frederick
Mrs George wondered within herself what he did there among the women
She also wondered just where he belonged on the family tree He was not
one of the uncles yet he could not be much younger than George

Forty if he is a day was Mrs Georges mental dictum but a very
handsome and fascinating man I never saw such a splendid chin and
dimple

Lucinda with bronzecolored hair and the whitest of skins defiant of
merciless sunlight and revelling in the crisp air sat on the sill of
the open window behind the crimson vine leaves looking out into the
garden where dahlias flamed and asters broke into waves of purple and
snow The ruddy light of the autumn afternoon gave a sheen to the waves
of her hair and brought out the exceeding purity of her Greek outlines

Mrs George knew who Lucinda wasa cousin of the second generation
and in spite of her thirtyfive years the acknowledged beauty of the
whole Penhallow connection

She was one of those rare women who keep their loveliness unmarred by
the passage of years She had ripened and matured but she had not
grown old The older Penhallows were still inclined from sheer force of
habit to look upon her as a girl and the younger Penhallows hailed her
as one of themselves Yet Lucinda never aped girlishness good taste and
a strong sense of humour preserved her amid many temptations thereto
She was simply a beautiful fully developed woman with whom Time had
declared a truce young with a mellow youth which had nothing to do with
years

Mrs George liked and admired Lucinda Now when Mrs George liked and
admired any person it was a matter of necessity with her to impart her
opinions to the most convenient confidant In this case it was Romney
Penhallow to whom Mrs George remarked sweetly

Really dont you think our Lucinda is looking remarkably well this
fall

It seemed a very harmless inane wellmeant question Poor Mrs George
might well be excused for feeling bewildered over the effect Romney
gathered his long legs together stood up and swept the unfortunate
speaker a crushing Penhallow bow of state

Far be it from me to disagree with the opinion of a ladyespecially
when it concerns another lady he said as he left the blue room

Overcome by the mordant satire in his tone Mrs George glanced
speechlessly at Lucinda Behold Lucinda had squarely turned her back on
the party and was gazing out into the garden with a very decided flush
on the snowy curves of her neck and cheek Then Mrs George looked at
her sistersinlaw They were regarding her with the tolerant amusement
they might bestow on a blundering child Mrs George experienced that
subtle prescience whereby it is given us to know that we have put our
foot in it She felt herself turning an uncomfortable brickred What
Penhallow skeleton had she unwittingly jangled Why oh why was it
such an evident breach of the proprieties to praise Lucinda

Mrs George was devoutly thankful that a summons to the teatable
rescued her from her mire of embarrassment The meal was spoiled for
her however the mortifying recollection of her mysterious blunder
conspired with her curiosity to banish appetite As soon as possible
after tea she decoyed Mrs Frederick out into the garden and in the
dahlia walk solemnly demanded the reason of it all

Mrs Frederick indulged in a laugh which put the mettle of her festal
brown silk seams to the test

My dear Cecilia it was SO amusing she said a little patronizingly

But WHY cried Mrs George resenting the patronage and the mystery
What was so dreadful in what I said Or so funny And WHO is this
Romney Penhallow who mustnt be spoken to

Oh Romney is one of the Charlottetown Penhallows explained Mrs
Frederick He is a lawyer there He is a first cousin of Lucindas and
a second of Georgesor is he Oh bother You must go to Uncle John
if you want the genealogy Im in a chronic muddle concerning Penhallow
relationship And as for Romney of course you can speak to him about
anything you like except Lucinda Oh you innocent To ask him if he
didnt think Lucinda was looking well And right before her too Of
course he thought you did it on purpose to tease him That was what made
him so savage and sarcastic

But WHY persisted Mrs George sticking tenaciously to her point

Hasnt George told you

No said Georges wife in mild exasperation George has spent most
of his time since we were married telling me odd things about the
Penhallows but he hasnt got to that yet evidently

Why my dear it is our family romance Lucinda and Romney are in love
with each other They have been in love with each other for fifteen
years and in all that time they have never spoken to each other once

Dear me murmured Mrs George feeling the inadequacy of mere
language Was this a Penhallow method of courtship But WHY

They had a quarrel fifteen years ago said Mrs Frederick patiently
Nobody knows how it originated or anything about it except that Lucinda
herself admitted it to us afterwards But in the first flush of her
rage she told Romney that she would never speak to him again as long
as she lived And HE said he would never speak to her until she spoke
firstbecause you see as she was in the wrong she ought to make the
first advance And they never have spoken Everybody in the connection
I suppose has taken turns trying to reconcile them but nobody has
succeeded I dont believe that Romney has ever so much as THOUGHT
of any other woman in his whole life and certainly Lucinda has never
thought of any other man You will notice she still wears Romneys ring
Theyre practically engaged still of course And Romney said once that
if Lucinda would just say one word no matter what it was even if it
were something insulting he would speak too and beg her pardon
for his share in the quarrelbecause then you see he would not be
breaking his word He hasnt referred to the matter for years but I
presume that he is of the same mind still And they are just as much in
love with each other as they ever were Hes always hanging about where
she iswhen other people are there too that is He avoids her like a
plague when she is alone That was why he was stuck out in the blue
room with us today There doesnt seem to be a particle of resentment
between them If Lucinda would only speak But that Lucinda will not
do

Dont you think she will yet said Mrs George

Mrs Frederick shook her crimped head sagely

Not now The whole thing has hardened too long Her pride will
never let her speak We used to hope she would be tricked into it by
forgetfulness or accidentwe used to lay traps for herbut all to no
effect It is such a shame too They were made for each other Do you
know I get cross when I begin to thrash the whole silly affair over
like this Doesnt it sound as if we were talking of the quarrel of two
schoolchildren Of late years we have learned that it does not do to
speak of Lucinda to Romney even in the most commonplace way He seems
to resent it

HE ought to speak cried Mrs George warmly Even if she were in the
wrong ten times over he ought to overlook it and speak first

But he wont And she wont You never saw two such determined mortals
They get it from their grandfather on the mothers sideold Absalom
Gordon There is no such stubbornness on the Penhallow side His
obstinacy was a proverb my dearactually a proverb What ever he said
he would stick to if the skies fell He was a terrible old man to swear
too added Mrs Frederick dropping into irrelevant reminiscence He
spent a long while in a mining camp in his younger days and he never got
over itthe habit of swearing I mean It would have made your blood
run cold my dear to have heard him go on at times And yet he was a
real good old man every other way He couldnt help it someway He
tried to but he used to say that profanity came as natural to him as
breathing It used to mortify his family terribly Fortunately none of
them took after him in that respect But hes deadand one shouldnt
speak ill of the dead I must go and get Mattie Penhallow to do my hair
I would burst these sleeves clean out if I tried to do it myself and I
dont want to dress over again You wont be likely to talk to Romney
about Lucinda again my dear Cecilia

Fifteen years murmured Mrs George helplessly to the dahlias
Engaged for fifteen years and never speaking to each other Dear heart
and soul think of it Oh these Penhallows

Meanwhile Lucinda serenely unconscious that her love story was being
mouthed over by Mrs Frederick in the dahlia garden was dressing for
the wedding Lucinda still enjoyed dressing for a festivity since the
mirror still dealt gently with her Moreover she had a new dress
Now a new dressand especially one as nice as thiswas a rarity with
Lucinda who belonged to a branch of the Penhallows noted for being
chronically hard up Indeed Lucinda and her widowed mother were
positively poor and hence a new dress was an event in Lucindas
existence An uncle had given her this onea beautiful perishable
thing such as Lucinda would never have dared to choose for herself but
in which she revelled with feminine delight

It was of pale green voilea colour which brought out admirably the
ruddy gloss of her hair and the clear brilliance of her skin When she
had finished dressing she looked at herself in the mirror with frank
delight Lucinda was not vain but she was quite well aware of the fact
of her beauty and took an impersonal pleasure in it as if she were
looking at some finely painted picture by a master hand

The form and face reflected in the glass satisfied her The puffs and
draperies of the green voile displayed to perfection the full but not
overfull curves of her fine figure Lucinda lifted her arm and touched
a red rose to her lips with the hand upon which shone the frosty glitter
of Romneys diamond looking at the graceful slope of her shoulder and
the splendid line of chin and throat with critical approval

She noted too how well the gown became her eyes bringing out all the
deeper colour in them Lucinda had magnificent eyes Once Romney had
written a sonnet to them in which he compared their colour to ripe
blueberries This may not sound poetical to you unless you know or
remember just what the tints of ripe blueberries aredusky purple in
some lights clear slate in others and yet again in others the misty
hue of early meadow violets

You really look very well remarked the real Lucinda to the mirrored
Lucinda Nobody would think you were an old maid But you are Alice
Penhallow who is to be married tonight was a child of five when you
thought of being married fifteen years ago That makes you an old maid
my dear Well it is your own fault and it will continue to be your own
fault you stubborn offshoot of a stubborn breed

She flung her train out straight and pulled on her gloves

I do hope I wont get any spots on this dress tonight she reflected
It will have to do me for a gala dress for a year at leastand I have
a creepy conviction that it is fearfully spottable Bless Uncle Marks
good uncalculating heart How I would have detested it if he had given
me something sensible and useful and uglyas Aunt Emilia would have
done

They all went to young John Penhallows at early moonrise Lucinda
drove over the two miles of hill and dale with a youthful second cousin
by name Carey Penhallow The wedding was quite a brilliant affair
Lucinda seemed to pervade the social atmosphere and everywhere she went
a little ripple of admiration trailed after her like a wave She was
undeniably a belle yet she found herself feeling faintly bored and was
rather glad than otherwise when the guests began to fray off

Im afraid Im losing my capacity for enjoyment she thought a little
drearily Yes I must be growing old That is what it means when social
functions begin to bore you

It was that unlucky Mrs George who blundered again She was standing on
the veranda when Carey Penhallow dashed up

Tell Lucinda that I cant take her back to the Grange I have to
drive Mark and Cissy Penhallow to Bright River to catch the two oclock
express There will be plenty of chances for her with the others

At this moment George Penhallow holding his rearing horse with
difficulty shouted for his wife Mrs George all in a flurry dashed
back into the still crowded hall Exactly to whom she gave her message
was never known to any of the Penhallows But a tall ruddyhaired girl
dressed in pale green organdyAnne Shirley from Avonleatold Marilla
Cuthbert and Rachel Lynde as a joke the next morning how a chubby little
woman in a bright pink fascinator had clutched her by the arm and
gasped out Carey Penhallow cant take youhe says youre to look out
for someone else and was gone before she could answer or turn around

Thus it was that Lucinda when she came out to the veranda step found
herself unaccountably deserted All the Grange Penhallows were gone
Lucinda realized this after a few moments of bewildered seeking and
she understood that if she were to get to the Grange that night she must
walk Plainly there was nobody to take her

Lucinda was angry It is not pleasant to find yourself forgotten and
neglected It is still less pleasant to walk home alone along a country
road at one oclock in the morning wearing a pale green voile Lucinda
was not prepared for such a walk She had nothing on her feet save
thinsoled shoes and her only wraps were a flimsy fascinator and a
short coat

What a guy I shall look stalking home alone in this rig she thought
crossly

There was no help for it unless she confessed her plight to some of the
stranger guests and begged a drive home Lucindas pride scorned such
a request and the admission of neglect it involved No she would walk
since that was all there was to it but she would not go by the main
road to be stared at by all and sundry who might pass her There was a
short cut by way of a lane across the fields she knew every inch of it
although she had not traversed it for years

She gathered up the green voile as trimly as possible slipped around
the house in the kindly shadows picked her way across the side lawn
and found a gate which opened into a birchbordered lane where the
frosted trees shone with silverygolden radiance in the moonlight
Lucinda flitted down the lane growing angrier at every step as the
realization of how shamefully she seemed to have been treated came home
to her She believed that nobody had thought about her at all which was
tenfold worse than premeditated neglect

As she came to the gate at the lower end of the lane a man who was
leaning over it started with a quick intake of his breath which in
any other man than Romney Penhallow or for any other woman than Lucinda
Penhallow would have been an exclamation of surprise

Lucinda recognized him with a great deal of annoyance and a little
relief She would not have to walk home alone But with Romney
Penhallow Would he think she had contrived it so purposely

Romney silently opened the gate for her silently latched it behind her
and silently fell into step beside her Down across a velvety sweep of
field they went the air was frosty calm and still over the world lay
a haze of moonshine and mist that converted East Graftons prosaic hills
and fields into a shimmering fairyland At first Lucinda felt angrier
than ever What a ridiculous situation How the Penhallows would laugh
over it

As for Romney he too was angry with the trick impish chance had
played him He liked being the butt of an awkward situation as little as
most men and certainly to be obliged to walk home over moonlit fields
at one oclock in the morning with the woman he had loved and never
spoken to for fifteen years was the irony of fate with a vengeance
Would she think he had schemed for it And how the deuce did she come to
be walking home from the wedding at all

By the time they had crossed the field and reached the wild cherry lane
beyond it Lucindas anger was mastered by her saving sense of humour
She was even smiling a little maliciously under her fascinator

The lane was a place of enchantmenta long moonlit colonnade adown
which beguiling wood nymphs might have footed it featly The moonshine
fell through the arching boughs and made a mosaic of silver light and
clearcut shadow for the unfriendly lovers to walk in On either side
was the hovering gloom of the woods and around them was a great silence
unstirred by wind or murmur

Midway in the lane Lucinda was attacked by a sentimental recollection
She thought of the last time Romney and she had walked home together
through this very lane from a party at young Johns It had been
moonlight then too andLucinda checked a sighthey had walked hand
in hand Just here by the big gray beech he had stopped her and kissed
her Lucinda wondered if he were thinking of it too and stole a look
at him from under the lace border of her fascinator

But he was striding moodily along with his hands in his pockets and his
hat pulled down over his eyes passing the old beech without a glance
at it Lucinda checked another sigh gathered up an escaped flutter of
voile and marched on

Past the lane a range of three silvery harvest fields sloped down to
Peter Penhallows brooka wide shallow stream bridged over in the
olden days by the mossy trunk of an ancient fallen tree When Lucinda
and Romney arrived at the brook they gazed at the brawling water
blankly Lucinda remembered that she must not speak to Romney just in
time to prevent an exclamation of dismay There was no tree There was
no bridge of any kind over the brook

Here was a predicament But before Lucinda could do more than
despairingly ask herself what was to be done now Romney answerednot
in words but in deeds He coolly picked Lucinda up in his arms as
if she had been a child instead of a full grown woman of no mean
avoirdupois and began to wade with her through the water

Lucinda gasped helplessly She could not forbid him and she was so
choked with rage over his presumption that she could not have spoken
in any case Then came the catastrophe Romneys foot slipped on a
treacherous round stonethere was a tremendous splashand Romney and
Lucinda Penhallow were sitting down in the middle of Peter Penhallows
brook

Lucinda was the first to regain her feet About her clung in
heartbreaking limpness the ruined voile The remembrance of all her
wrongs that night rushed over her soul and her eyes blazed in the
moonlight Lucinda Penhallow had never been so angry in her life

YOU DD IDIOT she said in a voice that literally shook with rage

Romney meekly scrambled up the bank after her

Im awfully sorry Lucinda he said striving with uncertain success
to keep a suspicious quiver of laughter out of his tone It was
wretchedly clumsy of me but that pebble turned right under my foot
Please forgive mefor thatand for other things

Lucinda deigned no answer She stood on a flat stone and wrung the water
from the poor green voile Romney surveyed her apprehensively

Hurry Lucinda he entreated You will catch your death of cold

I never take cold answered Lucinda with chattering teeth And it is
my dress I am thinking ofwas thinking of You have more need to hurry
You are sopping wet yourself and you know you are subject to colds
Therecome

Lucinda picked up the stringy train which had been so brave and buoyant
five minutes before and started up the field at a brisk rate Romney
came up to her and slipped his arm through hers in the old way For
a time they walked along in silence Then Lucinda began to shake with
inward laughter She laughed silently for the whole length of the field
and at the line fence between Peter Penhallows land and the Grange
acres she paused threw back the fascinator from her face and looked at
Romney defiantly

You are thinking ofTHAT she cried and I am thinking of it And we
will go on thinking of it at intervals for the rest of our lives But
if you ever mention it to me Ill never forgive you Romney Penhallow

I never will Romney promised There was more than a suspicion of
laughter in his voice this time but Lucinda did not choose to resent
it She did not speak again until they reached the Grange gate Then she
faced him solemnly

It was a case of atavism she said Old Grandfather Gordon was to
blame for it

At the Grange almost everybody was in bed What with the guests
straggling home at intervals and hurrying sleepily off to their rooms
nobody had missed Lucinda each set supposing she was with some other
set Mrs Frederick Mrs Nathaniel and Mrs George alone were up The
perennially chilly Mrs Nathaniel had kindled a fire of chips in the
blue room grate to warm her feet before retiring and the three women
were discussing the wedding in subdued tones when the door opened
and the stately form of Lucinda stately even in the dragged voile
appeared with the damp Romney behind her

Lucinda Penhallow gasped they one and all

I was left to walk home said Lucinda coolly So Romney and I came
across the fields There was no bridge over the brook and when he was
carrying me over he slipped and we fell in That is all No Cecilia I
never take cold so dont worry Yes my dress is ruined but that is of
no consequence No thank you Cecilia I do not care for a hot drink
Romney do go and take off those wet clothes of yours immediately No
Cecilia I will NOT take a hot footbath I am going straight to bed
Good night

When the door closed on the pair the three sistersinlaw stared at
each other Mrs Frederick feeling herself incapable of expressing her
sensations originally took refuge in a quotation


Do I sleep do I dream do I wonder and doubt Is things what they
seem or is visions about


There will be another Penhallow wedding soon said Mrs Nathaniel
with a long breath Lucinda has spoken to Romney AT LAST

Oh WHAT do you suppose she said to him cried Mrs George

My dear Cecilia said Mrs Frederick we shall never know

They never did know





VI Old Man Shaws Girl


Day after tomorrowday after tomorrow said Old Man Shaw rubbing
his long slender hands together gleefully I have to keep saying it
over and over so as to really believe it It seems far too good to be
true that Im to have Blossom again And everything is ready Yes
I think everything is ready except a bit of cooking And wont this
orchard be a surprise to her Im just going to bring her out here as
soon as I can never saying a word Ill fetch her through the
spruce lane and when we come to the end of the path Ill step back
casuallike and let her go out from under the trees alone never
suspecting Itll be worth ten times the trouble to see her big brown
eyes open wide and hear her say Oh daddy Why daddy

He rubbed his hands again and laughed softly to himself He was a tall
bent old man whose hair was snow white but whose face was fresh and
rosy His eyes were a boys eyes large blue and merry and his mouth
had never got over a youthful trick of smiling at any provocationand
ofttimes at no provocation at all

To be sure White Sands people would not have given you the most
favourable opinion in the world of Old Man Shaw First and foremost
they would have told you that he was shiftless and had let his bit
of a farm run out while he pottered with flowers and bugs or rambled
aimlessly about in the woods or read books along the shore Perhaps it
was true but the old farm yielded him a living and further than that
Old Man Shaw had no ambition He was as blithe as a pilgrim on a pathway
climbing to the west He had learned the rare secret that you must take
happiness when you find itthat there is no use in marking the place
and coming back to it at a more convenient season because it will not
be there then And it is very easy to be happy if you know as Old Man
Shaw most thoroughly knew how to find pleasure in little things He
enjoyed life he had always enjoyed life and helped others to enjoy it
consequently his life was a success whatever White Sands people might
think of it What if he had not improved his farm There are some
people to whom life will never be anything more than a kitchen garden
and there are others to whom it will always be a royal palace with domes
and minarets of rainbow fancy

The orchard of which he was so proud was as yet little more than the
substance of things hoped fora flourishing plantation of young trees
which would amount to something later on Old Man Shaws house was on
the crest of a bare sunny hill with a few staunch old firs and spruces
behind itthe only trees that could resist the full sweep of the winds
that blew bitterly up from the sea at times Fruit trees would never
grow near it and this had been a great grief to Sara

Oh daddy if we could just have an orchard she had been wont to say
wistfully when other farmhouses in White Sands were smothered whitely
in apple bloom And when she had gone away and her father had nothing
to look forward to save her return he was determined she should find an
orchard when she came back

Over the southward hill warmly sheltered by spruce woods and sloping
to the sunshine was a little field so fertile that all the slack
management of a lifetime had not availed to exhaust it Here Old Man
Shaw set out his orchard and saw it flourish watching and tending it
until he came to know each tree as a child and loved it His neighbours
laughed at him and said that the fruit of an orchard so far away from
the house would all be stolen But as yet there was no fruit and when
the time came for bearing there would be enough and to spare

Blossom and mell get all we want and the boys can have the rest if
they want em worsen they want a good conscience said that unworldly
unbusinesslike Old Man Shaw

On his way back home from his darling orchard he found a rare fern in
the woods and dug it up for Sarashe had loved ferns He planted it
at the shady sheltered side of the house and then sat down on the old
bench by the garden gate to read her last letterthe letter that was
only a note because she was coming home soon He knew every word of
it by heart but that did not spoil the pleasure of rereading it every
halfhour

Old Man Shaw had not married until late in life and had so White
Sands people said selected a wife with his usual judgmentwhich being
interpreted meant no judgment at all otherwise he would never have
married Sara Glover a mere slip of a girl with big brown eyes like a
frightened wood creatures and the delicate fleeting bloom of a spring
Mayflower

The last woman in the world for a farmers wifeno strength or getup
about her

Neither could White Sands folk understand what on earth Sara Glover had
married him for

Well the fool crop was the only one that never failed

Old Man Shawhe was Old Man Shaw even then although he was only
fortyand his girl bride had troubled themselves not at all about White
Sands opinions They had one year of perfect happiness which is always
worth living for even if the rest of life be a dreary pilgrimage and
then Old Man Shaw found himself alone again except for little Blossom
She was christened Sara after her dead mother but she was always
Blossom to her fatherthe precious little blossom whose plucking had
cost the mother her life

Sara Glovers people especially a wealthy aunt in Montreal had
wanted to take the child but Old Man Shaw grew almost fierce over the
suggestion He would give his baby to no one A woman was hired to look
after the house but it was the father who cared for the baby in the
main He was as tender and faithful and deft as a woman Sara never
missed a mothers care and she grew up into a creature of life and
light and beauty a constant delight to all who knew her She had a way
of embroidering life with stars She was dowered with all the charming
characteristics of both parents with a resilient vitality and activity
which had pertained to neither of them When she was ten years old she
had packed all hirelings off and kept house for her father for six
delightful yearsyears in which they were father and daughter brother
and sister and chums Sara never went to school but her father saw
to her education after a fashion of his own When their work was done
they lived in the woods and fields in the little garden they had made
on the sheltered side of the house or on the shore where sunshine and
storm were to them equally lovely and beloved Never was comradeship
more perfect or more wholly satisfactory

Just wrapped up in each other said White Sands folk halfenviously
halfdisapprovingly

When Sara was sixteen Mrs Adair the wealthy aunt aforesaid pounced
down on White Sands in a glamour of fashion and culture and outer
worldliness She bombarded Old Man Shaw with such arguments that he had
to succumb It was a shame that a girl like Sara should grow up in a
place like White Sands with no advantages and no education said Mrs
Adair scornfully not understanding that wisdom and knowledge are two
entirely different things

At least let me give my dear sisters child what I would have given my
own daughter if I had had one she pleaded tearfully Let me take
her with me and send her to a good school for a few years Then if she
wishes she may come back to you of course

Privately Mrs Adair did not for a moment believe that Sara would want
to come back to White Sands and her queer old father after three years
of the life she would give her

Old Man Shaw yielded influenced thereto not at all by Mrs Adairs
readily flowing tears but greatly by his conviction that justice to
Sara demanded it Sara herself did not want to go she protested and
pleaded but her father having become convinced that it was best for
her to go was inexorable Everything even her own feelings must give
way to that But she was to come back to him without let or hindrance
when her schooling was done It was only on having this most clearly
understood that Sara would consent to go at all Her last words called
back to her father through her tears as she and her aunt drove down the
lane were

Ill be back daddy In three years Ill be back Dont cry but just
look forward to that

He had looked forward to it through the three long lonely years that
followed in all of which he never saw his darling Half a continent
was between them and Mrs Adair had vetoed vacation visits under some
specious pretense But every week brought its letter from Sara Old
Man Shaw had every one of them tied up with one of her old blue hair
ribbons and kept in her mothers little rosewood workbox in the
parlour He spent every Sunday afternoon rereading them with her
photograph before him He lived alone refusing to be pestered with kind
help but he kept the house in beautiful order

A better housekeeper than farmer said White Sands people He would
have nothing altered When Sara came back she was not to be hurt by
changes It never occurred to him that she might be changed herself

And now those three interminable years were gone and Sara was coming
home She wrote him nothing of her aunts pleadings and reproaches and
ready futile tears she wrote only that she would graduate in June and
start for home a week later Thenceforth Old Man Shaw went about in a
state of beatitude making ready for her homecoming As he sat on the
bench in the sunshine with the blue sea sparkling and crinkling down at
the foot of the green slope he reflected with satisfaction that all
was in perfect order There was nothing left to do save count the hours
until that beautiful longedfor day after tomorrow He gave himself
over to a reverie as sweet as a daydream in a haunted valley

The red roses were out in bloom Sara had always loved those red
rosesthey were as vivid as herself with all her own fullness of life
and joy of living And besides these a miracle had happened in Old Man
Shaws garden In one corner was a rosebush which had never bloomed
despite all the coaxing they had given itthe sulky rosebush
Sara had been wont to call it Lo this summer had flung the hoarded
sweetness of years into plentiful white blossoms like shallow ivory
cups with a haunting spicy fragrance It was in honour of Saras
homecomingso Old Man Shaw liked to fancy All things even the sulky
rosebush knew she was coming back and were making glad because of it

He was gloating over Saras letter when Mrs Peter Blewett came She
told him she had run up to see how he was getting on and if he wanted
anything seen to before Sara came

Nom thank you maam Everything is attended to I couldnt let
anyone else prepare for Blossom Only to think maam shell be home
the day after tomorrow Im just filled clear through body soul and
spirit with joy to think of having my little Blossom at home again

Mrs Blewett smiled sourly When Mrs Blewett smiled it foretokened
trouble and wise people had learned to have sudden business elsewhere
before the smile could be translated into words But Old Man Shaw had
never learned to be wise where Mrs Blewett was concerned although she
had been his nearest neighbour for years and had pestered his life out
with advice and neighbourly turns

Mrs Blewett was one with whom life had gone awry The effect on her was
to render happiness to other people a personal insult She resented Old
Man Shaws beaming delight in his daughters return and she considered
it her duty to rub the bloom off straightway

Do you think Saryll be contented in White Sands now she asked

Old Man Shaw looked slightly bewildered

Of course shell be contented he said slowly Isnt it her home And
aint I here

Mrs Blewett smiled again with double distilled contempt for such
simplicity

Well its a good thing youre so sure of it I suppose If twas
my daughter that was coming back to White Sands after three years of
fashionable life among rich stylish folks and at a swell school I
wouldnt have a minutes peace of mind Id know perfectly well that
shed look down on everything here and be discontented and miserable

YOUR daughter might said Old Man Shaw with more sarcasm than he had
supposed he had possessed but Blossom wont

Mrs Blewett shrugged her sharp shoulders

Maybe not Its to be hoped not for both your sakes Im sure But Id
be worried if twas me Sarys been living among fine folks and having
a gay exciting time and it stands to reason shell think White Sands
fearful lonesome and dull Look at Lauretta Bradley She was up in
Boston for just a month last winter and shes never been able to endure
White Sands since

Lauretta Bradley and Sara Shaw are two different people said Saras
father trying to smile

And your house too pursued Mrs Blewett ruthlessly Its such a
queer little old place Whatll she think of it after her aunts
Ive heard tell Mrs Adair lives in a perfect palace Ill just warn you
kindly that Saryll probably look down on you and you might as well be
prepared for it Of course I suppose she kind of thinks she has to come
back seeing she promised you so solemn she would But Im certain she
doesnt want to and I dont blame her either

Even Mrs Blewett had to stop for breath and Old Man Shaw found his
opportunity He had listened dazed and shrinking as if she were
dealing him physical blows but now a swift change swept over him His
blue eyes flashed ominously straight into Mrs Blewetts straggling
ferrety gray orbs

If youre said your say Martha Blewett you can go he said
passionately Im not going to listen to another such word Take
yourself out of my sight and your malicious tongue out of my hearing

Mrs Blewett went too dumfounded by such an unheardof outburst in mild
Old Man Shaw to say a word of defence or attack When she had gone Old
Man Shaw the fire all faded from his eyes sank back on his bench
His delight was dead his heart was full of pain and bitterness Martha
Blewett was a warped and illnatured woman but he feared there was
altogether too much truth in what she said Why had he never thought of
it before Of course White Sands would seem dull and lonely to Blossom
of course the little gray house where she was born would seem a poor
abode after the splendours of her aunts home Old Man Shaw walked
through his garden and looked at everything with new eyes How poor and
simple everything was How sagging and weatherbeaten the old house He
went in and upstairs to Saras room It was neat and clean just as
she had left it three years ago But it was small and dark the ceiling
was discoloured the furniture oldfashioned and shabby she would think
it a poor mean place Even the orchard over the hill brought him no
comfort now Blossom would not care for orchards She would be ashamed
of her stupid old father and the barren farm She would hate White
Sands and chafe at the dull existence and look down on everything that
went to make up his uneventful life

Old Man Shaw was unhappy enough that night to have satisfied even Mrs
Blewett had she known He saw himself as he thought White Sands folk
must see hima poor shiftless foolish old man who had only one thing
in the world worthwhile his little girl and had not been of enough
account to keep her

Oh Blossom Blossom he said and when he spoke her name it sounded
as if he spoke the name of one dead

After a little the worst sting passed away He refused to believe long
that Blossom would be ashamed of him he knew she would not Three years
could not so alter her loyal natureno nor ten times three years But
she would be changedshe would have grown away from him in those three
busy brilliant years His companionship could no longer satisfy her
How simple and childish he had been to expect it She would be sweet
and kindBlossom could never be anything else She would not show open
discontent or dissatisfaction she would not be like Lauretta Bradley
but it would be there and he would divine it and it would break his
heart Mrs Blewett was right When he had given Blossom up he should
not have made a halfhearted thing of his sacrificehe should not have
bound her to come back to him

He walked about in his little garden until late at night under the
stars with the sea crooning and calling to him down the slope When
he finally went to bed he did not sleep but lay until morning with
tearwet eyes and despair in his heart All the forenoon he went about
his usual daily work absently Frequently he fell into long reveries
standing motionless wherever he happened to be and looking dully before
him Only once did he show any animation When he saw Mrs Blewett
coming up the lane he darted into the house locked the door and
listened to her knocking in grim silence After she had gone he went
out and found a plate of fresh doughnuts covered with a napkin placed
on the bench at the door Mrs Blewett meant to indicate thus that she
bore him no malice for her curt dismissal the day before possibly
her conscience gave her some twinges also But her doughnuts could
not minister to the mind she had diseased Old Man Shaw took them up
carried them to the pigpen and fed them to the pigs It was the first
spiteful thing he had done in his life and he felt a most immoral
satisfaction in it

In midafternoon he went out to the garden finding the new loneliness
of the little house unbearable The old bench was warm in the sunshine
Old Man Shaw sat down with a long sigh and dropped his white head
wearily on his breast He had decided what he must do He would tell
Blossom that she might go back to her aunt and never mind about himhe
would do very well by himself and he did not blame her in the least

He was still sitting broodingly there when a girl came up the lane She
was tall and straight and walked with a kind of uplift in her motion
as if it would be rather easier to fly than not She was dark with a
rich dusky sort of darkness suggestive of the bloom on purple plums
or the glow of deep red apples among bronze leaves Her big brown eyes
lingered on everything in sight and little gurgles of sound now and
again came through her parted lips as if inarticulate joy were thus
expressing itself

At the garden gate she saw the bent figure on the old bench and the
next minute she was flying along the rose walk

Daddy she called daddy

Old Man Shaw stood up in hasty bewilderment then a pair of girlish arms
were about his neck and a pair of warm red lips were on his girlish
eyes full of love were looking up into his and a neverforgotten
voice tingling with laughter and tears blended into one delicious
chord was crying

Oh daddy is it really you Oh I cant tell you how good it is to see
you again

Old Man Shaw held her tightly in a silence of amazement and joy too deep
for wonder Why this was his Blossomthe very Blossom who had gone
away three years ago A little taller a little more womanly but his
own dear Blossom and no stranger There was a new heaven and a new
earth for him in the realization

Oh Baby Blossom he murmured Little Baby Blossom

Sara rubbed her cheek against the faded coat sleeve

Daddy darling this moment makes up for everything doesnt it

Butbutwhere did you come from he asked his senses beginning to
struggle out of their bewilderment of surprise I didnt expect you
till tomorrow You didnt have to walk from the station did you And
your old daddy not there to welcome you

Sara laughed swung herself back by the tips of her fingers and danced
around him in the childish fashion of long ago

I found I could make an earlier connection with the CPA yesterday
and get to the Island last night I was in such a fever to get home that
I jumped at the chance Of course I walked from the stationits only
two miles and every step was a benediction My trunks are over there
Well go after them tomorrow daddy but just now I want to go straight
to every one of the dear old nooks and spots at once

You must get something to eat first he urged fondly And there aint
much in the house Im afraid I was going to bake tomorrow morning
But I guess I can forage you out something darling

He was sorely repenting having given Mrs Blewetts doughnuts to the
pigs but Sara brushed all such considerations aside with a wave of her
hand

I dont want anything to eat just now By and by well have a snack
just as we used to get up for ourselves whenever we felt hungry
Dont you remember how scandalized White Sands folks used to be at our
irregular hours Im hungry but its soul hunger for a glimpse of all
the dear old rooms and places Comethere are four hours yet before
sunset and I want to cram into them all Ive missed out of these three
years Let us begin right here with the garden Oh daddy by what
witchcraft have you coaxed that sulky rosebush into bloom

No witchcraft at allit just bloomed because you were coming home
baby said her father

They had a glorious afternoon of it those two children They explored
the garden and then the house Sara danced through every room and then
up to her own holding fast to her fathers hand

Oh its lovely to see my little room again daddy Im sure all my old
hopes and dreams are waiting here for me

She ran to the window and threw it open leaning out

Daddy theres no view in the world so beautiful as that curve of sea
between the headlands Ive looked at magnificent sceneryand then Id
shut my eyes and conjure up that picture Oh listen to the wind keening
in the trees How Ive longed for that music

He took her to the orchard and followed out his crafty plan of surprise
perfectly She rewarded him by doing exactly what he had dreamed of her
doing clapping her hands and crying out

Oh daddy Why daddy

They finished up with the shore and then at sunset they came back
and sat down on the old garden bench Before them a sea of splendour
burning like a great jewel stretched to the gateways of the west
The long headlands on either side were darkly purple and the sun left
behind him a vast cloudless arc of fiery daffodil and elusive rose
Back over the orchard in a cool green sky glimmered a crystal planet
and the night poured over them a clear wine of dew from her airy
chalice The spruces were rejoicing in the wind and even the battered
firs were singing of the sea Old memories trooped into their hearts
like shining spirits

Baby Blossom said Old Man Shaw falteringly are you quite sure
youll be contented here Out therewith a vague sweep of his
hand towards horizons that shut out a world far removed from White
Sandstheres pleasure and excitement and all that Wont you miss it
Wont you get tired of your old father and White Sands

Sara patted his hand gently

The world out there is a good place she said thoughtfully Ive had
three splendid years and I hope theyll enrich my whole life There are
wonderful things out there to see and learn fine noble people to meet
beautiful deeds to admire but she wound her arm about his neck and
laid her cheek against histhere is no daddy

And Old Man Shaw looked silently at the sunsetor rather through the
sunset to still grander and more radiant splendours beyond of which the
things seen were only the pale reflections not worthy of attention from
those who had the gift of further sight





VII Aunt Olivias Beau


Aunt Olivia told Peggy and me about him on the afternoon we went over
to help her gather her late roses for potpourri We found her strangely
quiet and preoccupied As a rule she was fond of mild fun alert to hear
East Grafton gossip and given to sudden little trills of almost girlish
laughter which for the time being dispelled the atmosphere of gentle
oldmaidishness which seemed to hang about her as a garment At
such moments we did not find it hard to believeas we did at other
timesthat Aunt Olivia had once been a girl herself

This day she picked the roses absently and shook the fairy petals into
her little sweetgrass basket with the air of a woman whose thoughts
were far away We said nothing knowing that Aunt Olivias secrets
always came our way in time When the roseleaves were picked we
carried them in and upstairs in single file Aunt Olivia bringing up
the rear to pick up any stray roseleaf we might drop In the southwest
room where there was no carpet to fade we spread them on newspapers on
the floor Then we put our sweetgrass baskets back in the proper place
in the proper closet in the proper room What would have happened to us
or to the sweetgrass baskets if this had not been done I do not know
Nothing was ever permitted to remain an instant out of place in Aunt
Olivias house

When we went downstairs Aunt Olivia asked us to go into the parlour
She had something to tell us she said and as she opened the door a
delicate pink flush spread over her face I noted it with surprise but
no inkling of the truth came to mefor nobody ever connected the idea
of possible lovers or marriage with this prim little old maid Olivia
Sterling

Aunt Olivias parlour was much like herselfpainfully neat Every
article of furniture stood in exactly the same place it had always
stood Nothing was ever suffered to be disturbed The tassels of the
crazy cushion lay just so over the arm of the sofa and the crochet
antimacassar was always spread at precisely the same angle over the
horsehair rocking chair No speck of dust was ever visible no fly ever
invaded that sacred apartment

Aunt Olivia pulled up a blind to let in what light could sift finely
through the vine leaves and sat down in a highbacked old chair that
had appertained to her greatgrandmother She folded her hands in her
lap and looked at us with shy appeal in her bluegray eyes Plainly she
found it hard to tell us her secret yet all the time there was an air
of pride and exultation about her somewhat also of a new dignity
Aunt Olivia could never be selfassertive but if it had been possible
that would have been her time for it

Have you ever heard me speak of Mr Malcolm MacPherson asked Aunt
Olivia

We had never heard her or anybody else speak of Mr Malcolm
MacPherson but volumes of explanation could not have told us more about
him than did Aunt Olivias voice when she pronounced his name We knew
as if it had been proclaimed to us in trumpet tones that Mr Malcolm
MacPherson must be Aunt Olivias beau and the knowledge took away our
breath We even forgot to be curious so astonished were we

And there sat Aunt Olivia proud and shy and exulting and shamefaced
all at once

He is a brother of Mrs John Seamans across the bridge explained
Aunt Olivia with a little simper Of course you dont remember him
He went out to British Columbia twenty years ago But he is coming home
nowandandtell your father wont youIIdont like to tell
himMr Malcolm MacPherson and I are going to be married

Married gasped Peggy And married I echoed stupidly

Aunt Olivia bridled a little

There is nothing unsuitable in that is there she asked rather
crisply

Oh no no I hastened to assure her giving Peggy a surreptitious
kick to divert her thoughts from laughter Only you must realize Aunt
Olivia that this is a very great surprise to us I thought it would
be so said Aunt Olivia complacently But your father will knowhe
will remember I do hope he wont think me foolish He did not think Mr
Malcolm MacPherson was a fit person for me to marry once But that
was long ago when Mr Malcolm MacPherson was very poor He is in very
comfortable circumstances now

Tell us about it Aunt Olivia said Peggy She did not look at me
which was my salvation Had I caught Peggys eye when Aunt Olivia said
Mr Malcolm MacPherson in that tone I must have laughed willynilly

When I was a girl the MacPhersons used to live across the road from
here Mr Malcolm MacPherson was my beau then But my familyand your
father especiallydear me I do hope he wont be very crosswere
opposed to his attentions and were very cool to him I think that was
why he never said anything to me about getting married then And after
a time he went away as I have said and I never heard anything from him
directly for many a year Of course his sister sometimes gave me news
of him But last June I had a letter from him He said he was coming
home to settle down for good on the old Island and he asked me if I
would marry him I wrote back and said I would Perhaps I ought to have
consulted your father but I was afraid he would think I ought to refuse
Mr Malcolm MacPherson

Oh I dont think father will mind said Peggy reassuringly

I hope not because of course I would consider it my duty in any case
to fulfil the promise I have given to Mr Malcolm MacPherson He will be
in Grafton next week the guest of his sister Mrs John Seaman across
the bridge

Aunt Olivia said that exactly as if she were reading it from the
personal column of the Daily Enterprise

When is the wedding to be I asked

Oh Aunt Olivia blushed distressfully I do not know the exact date
Nothing can be definitely settled until Mr Malcolm MacPherson comes
But it will not be before September at the earliest There will be so
much to do You will tell your father wont you

We promised that we would and Aunt Olivia arose with an air of relief
Peggy and I hurried over home stopping when we were safely out of
earshot to laugh The romances of the middleaged may be to them as
tender and sweet as those of youth but they are apt to possess a good
deal of humour for onlookers Only youth can be sentimental without
being mirthprovoking We loved Aunt Olivia and were glad for her
late newblossoming happiness but we felt amused over it also The
recollection of her Mr Malcolm MacPherson was too much for us every
time we thought of it

Father poohpoohed incredulously at first and when we had convinced
him guffawed with laughter Aunt Olivia need not have dreaded any more
opposition from her cruel family

MacPherson was a good fellow enough but horribly poor said father
I hear he has done very well out west and if he and Olivia have a
notion of each other they are welcome to marry as far as I am concerned
Tell Olivia she mustnt take a spasm if he tracks some mud into her
house once in a while

Thus it was all arranged and before we realized it at all Aunt Olivia
was middeep in marriage preparations in all of which Peggy and I were
quite indispensable She consulted us in regard to everything and we
almost lived at her place in those days preceding the arrival of Mr
Malcolm MacPherson

Aunt Olivia plainly felt very happy and important She had always
wished to be married she was not in the least strongminded and her
oldmaidenhood had always been a sore point with her I think she looked
upon it as somewhat of a disgrace And yet she was a born old maid
looking at her and taking all her primness and little set ways into
consideration it was quite impossible to picture her as the wife of Mr
Malcolm MacPherson or anybody else

We soon discovered that to Aunt Olivia Mr Malcolm MacPherson
represented a merely abstract propositionthe man who was to confer on
her the longwithheld dignity of matronhood Her romance began and ended
there although she was quite unconscious of this herself and believed
that she was deeply in love with him

What will be the result Mary when he arrives in the flesh and she
is compelled to deal with Mr Malcolm MacPherson as a real live
man instead of a nebulous party of the second part in the marriage
ceremony queried Peggy as she hemmed tablenapkins for Aunt Olivia
sitting on her wellscoured sandstone steps and carefully putting all
threadclippings and ravellings into the little basket which Aunt Olivia
had placed there for that purpose

It may transform her from a selfcentered old maid into a woman for
whom marriage does not seem such an incongruous thing I said

The day on which Mr Malcolm MacPherson was expected Peggy and I went
over We had planned to remain away thinking that the lovers would
prefer their first meeting to be unwitnessed but Aunt Olivia insisted
on our being present She was plainly nervous the abstract was becoming
concrete Her little house was in spotless speckless order from top to
bottom Aunt Olivia had herself scrubbed the garret floor and swept the
cellar steps that very morning with as much painstaking care as if she
expected that Mr Malcolm MacPherson would hasten to inspect each at
once and she must stand or fall by his opinion of them

Peggy and I helped her to dress She insisted on wearing her best black
silk in which she looked unnaturally fine Her soft muslin became her
much better but we could not induce her to wear it Anything more prim
and bandboxy than Aunt Olivia when her toilet was finished it has never
been my lot to see Peggy and I watched her as she went downstairs her
skirt held stiffly up all around her that it might not brush the floor

Mr Malcolm MacPherson will be inspired with such awe that he will
only be able to sit back and gaze at her whispered Peggy I wish he
would come and have it over This is getting on my nerves

Aunt Olivia went into the parlour settled herself in the old carved
chair and folded her hands Peggy and I sat down on the stairs to
await his coming in a crisping suspense Aunt Olivias kitten a fat
bewhiskered creature looking as if it were cut out of black velvet
shared our vigil and purred in maddening peace of mind

We could see the garden path and gate through the hall window and
therefore supposed we should have full warning of the approach of Mr
Malcolm MacPherson It was no wonder therefore that we positively
jumped when a thunderous knock crashed against the front door and
reechoed through the house Had Mr Malcolm MacPherson dropped from the
skies

We afterwards discovered that he had come across lots and around the
house from the back but just then his sudden advent was almost uncanny
I ran downstairs and opened the door On the step stood a man about
six feet two in height and proportionately broad and sinewy He had
splendid shoulders a great crop of curly black hair big twinkling
blue eyes and a tremendous crinkly black beard that fell over his
breast in shining waves In brief Mr Malcolm MacPherson was what one
would call instinctively if somewhat tritely a magnificent specimen
of manhood

In one hand he carried a bunch of early goldenrod and smokeblue asters

Good afternoon he said in a resonant voice which seemed to take
possession of the drowsy summer afternoon Is Miss Olivia Sterling in
And will you please tell her that Malcolm MacPherson is here

I showed him into the parlour Then Peggy and I peeped through the crack
of the door Anyone would have done it We would have scorned to excuse
ourselves And indeed what we saw would have been worth several
conscience spasms if we had felt any

Aunt Olivia arose and advanced primly with outstretched hand

Mr MacPherson I am very glad to see you she said formally

Its yourself Nillie Mr Malcolm MacPherson gave two strides

He dropped his flowers on the floor knocked over a small table and
sent the ottoman spinning against the wall Then he caught Aunt
Olivia in his arms andsmack smack smack Peggy sank back upon the
stairstep with her handkerchief stuffed in her mouth Aunt Olivia was
being kissed

Presently Mr Malcolm MacPherson held her back at arms length in his
big paws and looked her over I saw Aunt Olivias eyes roam over his arm
to the inverted table and the litter of asters and goldenrod Her sleek
crimps were all ruffled up and her lace fichu twisted half around her
neck She looked distressed

Its not a bit changed you are Nillie said Mr Malcolm MacPherson
admiringly And its good Im feeling to see you again Are you glad to
see me Nillie

Oh of course said Aunt Olivia

She twisted herself free and went to set up the table Then she turned
to the flowers but Mr Malcolm MacPherson had already gathered them up
leaving a goodly sprinkling of leaves and stalks on the carpet

I picked these for you in the river field Nillie he said Where
will I be getting something to stick them in Here this will do

He grasped a frail painted vase on the mantel stuffed the flowers in
it and set it on the table The look on Aunt Olivias face was too much
for me at last I turned caught Peggy by the shoulder and dragged her
out of the house

He will horrify the very soul out of Aunt Olivias body if he goes on
like this I gasped But hes splendidand he thinks the world of
herand oh Peggy did you EVER hear such kisses Fancy Aunt Olivia

It did not take us long to get well acquainted with Mr Malcolm
MacPherson He almost haunted Aunt Olivias house and Aunt Olivia
insisted on our staying with her most of the time She seemed to be very
shy of finding herself alone with him He horrified her a dozen times in
an hour nevertheless she was very proud of him and liked to be teased
about him too She was delighted that we admired him

Though to be sure he is very different in his looks from what he used
to be she said He is so dreadfully big And I do not like a beard
but I have not the courage to ask him to shave it off He might be
offended He has bought the old Lynde place in Avonlea and wants to
be married in a month But dear me that is too soon Itit would be
hardly proper

Peggy and I liked Mr Malcolm MacPherson very much So did father We
were glad that he seemed to think Aunt Olivia perfection He was as
happy as the day was long but poor Aunt Olivia under all her surface
pride and importance was not Amid all the humour of the circumstances
Peggy and I snuffed tragedy compounded with the humour

Mr Malcolm MacPherson could never be trained to oldmaidishness and
even Aunt Olivia seemed to realize this He never stopped to clear his
boots when he came in although she had an ostentatiously new scraper
put at each door for his benefit He seldom moved in the house without
knocking some of Aunt Olivias treasures over He smoked cigars in her
parlour and scattered the ashes over the floor He brought her flowers
every day and stuck them into whatever receptacle came handiest He sat
on her cushions and rolled her antimacassars up into balls He put
his feet on her chair rungsand all with the most distracting
unconsciousness of doing anything out of the way He never noticed Aunt
Olivias fluttering nervousness at all Peggy and I laughed more than
was good for us those days It was so funny to see Aunt Olivia hovering
anxiously around picking up flower stems and smoothing out tidies and
generally following him about to straighten out things Once she even
got a wing and dustpan and swept the cigar ashes under his very eyes

Now dont be worrying yourself over that Nillie he protested Why
I dont mind a litter bless you

How good and jolly he was that Mr Malcolm MacPherson Such songs as he
sang such stories as he told such a breezy unconventional atmosphere
as he brought into that prim little house where stagnant dullness had
reigned for years He worshipped Aunt Olivia and his worship took the
concrete form of presents galore He brought her a present almost every
visitgenerally some article of jewelry Bracelets rings chains
eardrops lockets bangles were showered upon our precise little aunt
she accepted them deprecatingly but never wore them This hurt him a
little but she assured him she would wear them all sometimes

I am not used to jewelry Mr MacPherson she would tell him

Her engagement ring she did wearit was a rather loud combination
of engraved gold and opals Sometimes we caught her turning it on her
finger with a very troubled face

I would be sorry for Mr Malcolm MacPherson if he were not so much in
love with her said Peggy But as he thinks that she is perfection he
doesnt need sympathy

I am sorry for Aunt Olivia I said Yes Peggy I am Mr MacPherson
is a splendid man but Aunt Olivia is a born old maid and it is
outraging her very nature to be anything else Dont you see how its
hurting her His big splendid manways are harrowing her very soul
upshe cant get out of her little narrow groove and it is killing
her to be pulled out

Nonsense said Peggy Then she added with a laugh

Mary did you ever see anything so funny as Aunt Olivia sitting on Mr
Malcolm MacPhersons knee

It WAS funny Aunt Olivia thought it very unbecoming to sit there before
us but he made her do it He would say with his big jolly laugh
Dont be minding the little girls and pull her down on his knee and
hold her there To my dying day I shall never forget the expression on
the poor little womans face

But as the days went by and Mr Malcolm MacPherson began to insist on
a date being set for the wedding Aunt Olivia grew to have a strangely
disturbed look She became very quiet and never laughed except under
protest Also she showed signs of petulance when any of us but
especially father teased her about her beau I pitied her for I think
I understood better than the others what her feelings really were But
even I was not prepared for what did happen I would not have believed
that Aunt Olivia could do it I thought that her desire for marriage in
the abstract would outweigh the disadvantages of the concrete But one
can never reckon with real bredinthebone oldmaidism

One morning Mr Malcolm MacPherson told us all that he was coming up
that evening to make Aunt Olivia set the day Peggy and I laughingly
approved telling him that it was high time for him to assert his
authority and he went off in great good humour across the river field
whistling a Highland strathspey But Aunt Olivia looked like a martyr
She had a fierce attack of housecleaning that day and put everything in
flawless order even to the corners

As if there was going to be a funeral in the house sniffed Peggy

Peggy and I were up in the southwest room at dusk that evening piecing
a quilt when we heard Mr Malcolm MacPherson shouting out in the hall
below to know if anyone was home I ran out to the landing but as I
did so Aunt Olivia came out of her room brushed past me and flitted
downstairs

Mr MacPherson I heard her say with doubledistilled primness will
you please come into the parlour I have something to say to you

They went in and I returned to the southwest room

Peg theres trouble brewing I said Im sure of it by Aunt Olivias
face it was GRAY And she has gone down ALONEand shut the door

I am going to hear what she says to him said Peggy resolutely It is
her own faultshe has spoiled us by always insisting that we should be
present at their interviews That poor man has had to do his courting
under our very eyes Come on Mary

The southwest room was directly over the parlour and there was an open
stovepipehole leading up therefrom Peggy removed the hat box that
was on it and we both deliberately and shamelessly crouched down and
listened with all our might

It was easy enough to hear what Mr Malcolm MacPherson was saying

Ive come up to get the date settled Nillie as I told you Come now
little woman name the day

SMACK

Dont Mr MacPherson said Aunt Olivia She spoke as a woman who
has keyed herself up to the doing of some very distasteful task and is
anxious to have it over and done with as soon as possible There is
something I must say to you I cannot marry you Mr MacPherson

There was a pause I would have given much to have seen the pair of
them When Mr Malcolm MacPherson spoke his voice was that of blank
uncomprehending amazement

Nillie what is it you are meaning he said

I cannot marry you Mr MacPherson repeated Aunt Olivia

Why not Surprise was giving way to dismay

I dont think you will understand Mr MacPherson said Aunt Olivia
faintly You dont realize what it means for a woman to give up
everythingher own home and friends and all her past life so to speak
and go far away with a stranger

Why I suppose it will be rather hard But Nillie Avonlea isnt very
far awaynot more than twelve miles if it will be that

Twelve miles It might as well be at the other side of the world to
all intents and purposes said Aunt Olivia obstinately I dont know a
living soul there except Rachel Lynde

Why didnt you say so before I bought the place then But its not too
late I can be selling it and buying right here in East Grafton if that
will please youthough there isnt half as nice a place to be had But
Ill fix it up somehow

No Mr MacPherson said Aunt Olivia firmly that doesnt cover the
difficulty I knew you would not understand My ways are not your ways
and I cannot make them over Foryou track mud inandandyou dont
care whether things are tidy or not

Poor Aunt Olivia had to be Aunt Olivia if she were being burned at the
stake I verily believe she would have dragged some grotesqueness into
the tragedy of the moment

The devil said Mr Malcolm MacPhersonnot profanely or angrily but
as in sheer bewilderment Then he added Nillie you must be joking
Its careless enough I amthe west isnt a good place to learn finicky
waysbut you can teach me Youre not going to throw me over because I
track mud in

I cannot marry you Mr MacPherson said Aunt Olivia again

You cant be meaning it he exclaimed because he was beginning to
understand that she did mean it although it was impossible for his
man mind to understand anything else about the puzzle Nillie its
breaking my heart you are Ill do anythinggo anywherebe anything
you wantonly dont be going back on me like this

I cannot marry you Mr MacPherson said Aunt Olivia for the fourth
time

Nillie exclaimed Mr Malcolm MacPherson There was such real agony in
his tone that Peggy and I were suddenly stricken with contrition
What were we doing We had no right to be listening to this pitiful
interview The pain and protest in his voice had suddenly banished all
the humour from it and left naught but the bare stark tragedy We rose
and tiptoed out of the room wholesomely ashamed of ourselves

When Mr Malcolm MacPherson had gone after an hour of useless pleading
Aunt Olivia came up to us pale and prim and determined and told us
that there was to be no wedding We could not pretend surprise but
Peggy ventured a faint protest

Oh Aunt Olivia do you think you have done right

It was the only thing I could do said Aunt Olivia stonily I could
not marry Mr Malcolm MacPherson and I told him so Please tell your
fatherand kindly say nothing more to me about the matter

Then Aunt Olivia went downstairs got a broom and swept up the mud Mr
Malcolm MacPherson had tracked over the steps

Peggy and I went home and told father We felt very flat but there was
nothing to be done or said Father laughed at the whole thing but I
could not laugh I was sorry for Mr Malcolm MacPherson and though I
was angry with her I was sorry for Aunt Olivia too Plainly she felt
badly enough over her vanished hopes and plans but she had developed a
strange and baffling reserve which nothing could pierce

Its nothing but a chronic case of oldmaidism said father
impatiently

Things were very dull for a week We saw no more of Mr Malcolm
MacPherson and we missed him dreadfully Aunt Olivia was inscrutable
and worked with fierceness at superfluous tasks

One evening father came home with some news Malcolm MacPherson is
leaving on the 730 train for the west he said He has rented the
Avonlea place and hes off They say he is mad as a hatter at the trick
Olivia played on him

After tea Peggy and I went over to see Aunt Olivia who had asked our
advice about a wrapper She was sewing as for dear life and her face
was primmer and colder than ever I wondered if she knew of Mr Malcolm
MacPhersons departure Delicacy forbade me to mention it but Peggy had
no such scruples

Well Aunt Olivia your beau is off she announced cheerfully You
wont be bothered with him again He is leaving on the mail train for
the west

Aunt Olivia dropped her sewing and stood up I have never seen anything
like the transformation that came over her It was so thorough and
sudden as to be almost uncanny The old maid vanished completely and in
her place was a woman full to the lips with primitive emotion and pain

What shall I do she cried in a terrible voice MaryPeggywhat
shall I do

It was almost a shriek Peggy turned pale

Do you care she said stupidly

Care Girls I shall DIE if Malcolm MacPherson goes away I have been
madI must have been mad I have almost died of loneliness since I sent
him away But I thought he would come back I must see himthere is
time to reach the station before the train goes if I go by the fields

She took a wild step towards the door but I caught her back with a
sudden mindvision of Aunt Olivia flying bareheaded and distraught
across the fields

Wait a moment Aunt Olivia Peggy run home and get father to harness
Dick in the buggy as quickly as he can Well drive Aunt Olivia to the
station Well get you there in time Aunty

Peggy flew and Aunt Olivia dashed upstairs I lingered behind to pick
up her sewing and when I got to her room she had her hat and cape on
Spread out on the bed were all the boxes of gifts which Mr Malcolm
MacPherson had brought her and Aunt Olivia was stringing their contents
feverishly about her person Rings three brooches a locket three
chains and a watch all went onanyway and anyhow A wonderful sight it
was to see Aunt Olivia bedizened like that

I would never wear them beforebut Ill put them all on now to show
him Im sorry she gasped with trembling lips

When the three of us crowded into the buggy Aunt Olivia grasped the
whip before we could prevent her and leaning out gave poor Dick such
a lash as he had never felt in his life before He went tearing down the
steep stony fastdarkening road in a fashion which made Peggy and me
cry out in alarm Aunt Olivia was usually the most timid of women but
now she didnt seem to know what fear was She kept whipping and
urging poor Dick the whole way to the station quite oblivious to our
assurances that there was plenty of time The people who met us that
night must have thought we were quite mad I held on the reins Peggy
gripped the swaying side of the buggy and Aunt Olivia bent forward
hat and hair blowing back from her set face with its strangely crimson
cheeks and plied the whip In such a guise did we whirl through the
village and over the twomile station road

When we drove up to the station where the train was shunting amid the
shadows Aunt Olivia made a flying leap from the buggy and ran along the
platform with her cape streaming behind her and all her brooches and
chains glittering in the lights I tossed the reins to a boy standing
near and we followed Just under the glare of the station lamp we saw
Mr Malcolm MacPherson grip in hand Fortunately no one else was very
near but it would have been all the same had they been the centre of a
crowd Aunt Olivia fairly flung herself against him

Malcolm she cried dont godont goIll marry youIll go
anywhereand I dont care how much mud you bring in

That truly Aunt Olivia touch relieved the tension of the situation a
little Mr MacPherson put his arm about her and drew her back into the
shadows

There there he soothed Of course I wont be going Dont cry
Nilliegirl

And youll come right back with me now implored Aunt Olivia clinging
to him as if she feared he would be whisked away from her yet if she let
go for a moment

Of course of course he said

Peggy got a chance home with a friend and Aunt Olivia and Mr Malcolm
MacPherson and I drove back in the buggy Mr MacPherson held Aunt
Olivia on his knee because there was no room but she would have sat
there I think had there been a dozen vacant seats She clung to him in
the most barefaced fashion and all her former primness and reserve were
swept away completely She kissed him a dozen times or more and told him
she loved himand I did not even smile nor did I want to Somehow it
did not seem in the least funny to me then nor does it now although it
doubtless will to others There was too much real intensity of feeling
in it all to leave any room for the ridiculous So wrapped up in each
other were they that I did not even feel superfluous

I set them safely down in Aunt Olivias yard and turned homeward
completely forgotten by the pair But in the moonlight which flooded
the front of the house I saw something that testified eloquently to the
transformation in Aunt Olivia It had rained that afternoon and the
yard was muddy Nevertheless she went in at her front door and took Mr
Malcolm MacPherson in with her without even a glance at the scraper





VIII The Quarantine at Alexander Abrahams


I refused to take that class in Sunday School the first time I was
asked It was not that I objected to teaching in the Sunday School On
the contrary I rather liked the idea but it was the Rev Mr Allan who
asked me and it had always been a matter of principle with me never
to do anything a man asked me to do if I could help it I was noted
for that It saves a great deal of trouble and it simplifies everything
beautifully I had always disliked men It must have been born in me
because as far back as I can remember an antipathy to men and dogs
was one of my strongest characteristics I was noted for that My
experiences through life only served to deepen it The more I saw of
men the more I liked cats

So of course when the Rev Allan asked me if I would consent to take a
class in Sunday School I said no in a fashion calculated to chasten
him wholesomely If he had sent his wife the first time as he did the
second it would have been wiser People generally do what Mrs Allan
asks them to do because they know it saves time

Mrs Allan talked smoothly for half an hour before she mentioned the
Sunday School and paid me several compliments Mrs Allan is famous
for her tact Tact is a faculty for meandering around to a given point
instead of making a beeline I have no tact I am noted for that As
soon as Mrs Allans conversation came in sight of the Sunday School I
who knew all along whither it was tending said straight out

What class do you want me to teach

Mrs Allan was so surprised that she forgot to be tactful and answered
plainly for once in her life

There are two classesone of boys and one of girlsneeding a teacher
I have been teaching the girls class but I shall have to give it up
for a little time on account of the babys health You may have your
choice Miss MacPherson

Then I shall take the boys I said decidedly I am noted for my
decision Since they have to grow up to be men its well to train
them properly betimes Nuisances they are bound to become under any
circumstances but if they are taken in hand young enough they may not
grow up to be such nuisances as they otherwise would and that will be
some unfortunate womans gain Mrs Allan looked dubious I knew she
had expected me to choose the girls

They are a very wild set of boys she said

I never knew boys who werent I retorted

IIthink perhaps you would like the girls best said Mrs Allan
hesitatingly If it had not been for one thingwhich I would never in
this world have admitted to Mrs AllanI might have liked the girls
class best myself But the truth was Anne Shirley was in that class
and Anne Shirley was the one living human being that I was afraid of
Not that I disliked her But she had such a habit of asking weird
unexpected questions which a Philadelphia lawyer couldnt answer
Miss Rogerson had that class once and Anne routed her horse foot
and artillery _I_ wasnt going to undertake a class with a walking
interrogation point in it like that Besides I thought Mrs Allan
required a slight snub Ministers wives are rather apt to think they
can run everything and everybody if they are not wholesomely corrected
now and again

It is not what _I_ like best that must be considered Mrs Allan I
said rebukingly It is what is best for those boys I feel that _I_
shall be best for THEM

Oh Ive no doubt of that Miss MacPherson said Mrs Allan amiably
It was a fib for her ministers wife though she was She HAD doubt She
thought I would be a dismal failure as teacher of a boys class

But I was not I am not often a dismal failure when I make up my mind to
do a thing I am noted for that

It is wonderful what a reformation you have worked in that class Miss
MacPhersonwonderful said the Rev Mr Allan some weeks later He
didnt mean to show how amazing a thing he thought it that an old
maid noted for being a man hater should have managed it but his face
betrayed him

Where does Jimmy Spencer live I asked him crisply He came one
Sunday three weeks ago and hasnt been back since I mean to find out
why

Mr Allan coughed

I believe he is hired as handy boy with Alexander Abraham Bennett out
on the White Sands road he said

Then I am going out to Alexander Abraham Bennetts on the White Sands
road to see why Jimmy Spencer doesnt come to Sunday school I said
firmly

Mr Allans eyes twinkled ever so slightly I have always insisted that
if that man were not a minister he would have a sense of humour

Possibly Mr Bennett will not appreciate your kind interest He
hasaha singular aversion to your sex I understand No woman has
ever been known to get inside of Mr Bennetts house since his sister
died twenty years ago

Oh he is the one is he I said remembering He is the woman hater
who threatens that if a woman comes into his yard hell chase her out
with a pitchfork Well he will not chase ME out

Mr Allan gave a chucklea ministerial chuckle but still a chuckle
It irritated me slightly because it seemed to imply that he thought
Alexander Abraham Bennett would be one too many for me But I did not
show Mr Allan that he annoyed me It is always a great mistake to let a
man see that he can vex you

The next afternoon I harnessed my sorrel pony to the buggy and drove
down to Alexander Abraham Bennetts As usual I took William Adolphus
with me for company William Adolphus is my favourite among my six cats
He is black with a white dicky and beautiful white paws He sat up on
the seat beside me and looked far more like a gentleman than many a man
Ive seen in a similar position

Alexander Abrahams place was about three miles along the White
Sands road I knew the house as soon as I came to it by its neglected
appearance It needed paint badly the blinds were crooked and torn
weeds grew up to the very door Plainly there was no woman about THAT
place Still it was a nice house and the barns were splendid My
father always said that when a mans barns were bigger than his house it
was a sign that his income exceeded his expenditure So it was all right
that they should be bigger but it was all wrong that they should be
trimmer and better painted Still thought I what else could you expect
of a woman hater

But Alexander Abraham evidently knows how to run a farm even it he is
a woman hater I remarked to William Adolphus as I got out and tied the
pony to the railing

I had driven up to the house from the back way and now I was opposite a
side door opening on the veranda I thought I might as well go to it so
I tucked William Adolphus under my arm and marched up the path Just
as I was halfway up a dog swooped around the front corner and made
straight for me He was the ugliest dog I had ever seen and he didnt
even barkjust came silently and speedily on with a businesslike eye

I never stop to argue matters with a dog that doesnt bark I know
when discretion is the better part of valour Firmly clasping William
Adolphus I rannot to the door because the dog was between me and it
but to a big lowbranching cherry tree at the back corner of the house
I reached it in time and no more First thrusting William Adolphus on
to a limb above my head I scrambled up into that blessed tree without
stopping to think how it might look to Alexander Abraham if he happened
to be watching

My time for reflection came when I found myself perched half way up the
tree with William Adolphus beside me William Adolphus was quite calm
and unruffled I can hardly say with truthfulness what I was On the
contrary I admit that I felt considerably upset

The dog was sitting on his haunches on the ground below watching us
and it was quite plain to be seen from his leisurely manner that it
was not his busy day He bared his teeth and growled when he caught my
eye

You LOOK like a woman haters dog I told him I meant it for an
insult but the beast took it for a compliment

Then I set myself to solving the question How am I to get out of this
predicament

It did not seem easy to solve it

Shall I scream William Adolphus I demanded of that intelligent
animal William Adolphus shook his head This is a fact And I agreed
with him

No I shall not scream William Adolphus I said There is probably
no one to hear me except Alexander Abraham and I have my painful doubts
about his tender mercies Now it is impossible to go down Is it then
William Adolphus possible to go up

I looked up Just above my head was an open window with a tolerably
stout branch extending right across it

Shall we try that way William Adolphus I asked

William Adolphus wasting no words began to climb the tree I followed
his example The dog ran in circles about the tree and looked things
not lawful to be uttered It probably would have been a relief to him to
bark if it hadnt been so against his principles

I got in by the window easily enough and found myself in a bedroom the
like of which for disorder and dust and general awfulness I had never
seen in all my life But I did not pause to take in details With
William Adolphus under my arm I marched downstairs fervently hoping I
should meet no one on the way

I did not The hall below was empty and dusty I opened the first door
I came to and walked boldly in A man was sitting by the window looking
moodily out I should have known him for Alexander Abraham anywhere He
had just the same uncaredfor ragged appearance that the house had and
yet like the house it seemed that he would not be bad looking if
he were trimmed up a little His hair looked as if it had never been
combed and his whiskers were wild in the extreme

He looked at me with blank amazement in his countenance

Where is Jimmy Spencer I demanded I have come to see him

How did he ever let you in asked the man staring at me

He didnt let me in I retorted He chased me all over the lawn and
I only saved myself from being torn piecemeal by scrambling up a tree
You ought to be prosecuted for keeping such a dog Where is Jimmy

Instead of answering Alexander Abraham began to laugh in a most
unpleasant fashion

Trust a woman for getting into a mans house if she has made up her
mind to he said disagreeably

Seeing that it was his intention to vex me I remained cool and
collected

Oh I wasnt particular about getting into your house Mr Bennett I
said calmly I had but little choice in the matter It was get in
lest a worse fate befall me It was not you or your house I wanted to
seealthough I admit that it is worth seeing if a person is anxious to
find out how dirty a place CAN be It was Jimmy For the third and last
timewhere is Jimmy

Jimmy is not here said Mr Bennett grufflybut not quite so
assuredly He left last week and hired with a man over at Newbridge

In that case I said picking up William Adolphus who had been
exploring the room with a disdainful air I wont disturb you any
longer I shall go

Yes I think it would be the wisest thing said Alexander Abrahamnot
disagreeably this time but reflectively as if there was some
doubt about the matter Ill let you out by the back door Then
theahemthe dog will not interfere with you Please go away quietly
and quickly

I wondered if Alexander Abraham thought I would go away with a whoop
But I said nothing thinking this the most dignified course of conduct
and I followed him out to the kitchen as quickly and quietly as he could
have wished Such a kitchen

Alexander Abraham opened the doorwhich was lockedjust as a buggy
containing two men drove into the yard

Too late he exclaimed in a tragic tone I understood that something
dreadful must have happened but I did not care since as I
fondly supposed it did not concern me I pushed out past Alexander
Abrahamwho was looking as guilty as if he had been caught
burglarizingand came face to face with the man who had sprung from the
buggy It was old Dr Blair from Carmody and he was looking at me as
if he had found me shoplifting

My dear Peter he said gravely I am VERY sorry to see you herevery
sorry indeed

I admit that this exasperated me Besides no man on earth not even my
own family doctor has any right to My dear Peter me

There is no loud call for sorrow doctor I said loftily If a woman
fortyeight years of age a member of the Presbyterian church in good
and regular standing cannot call upon one of her Sunday School scholars
without wrecking all the proprieties how old must she be before she
can

The doctor did not answer my question Instead he looked reproachfully
at Alexander Abraham

Is this how you keep your word Mr Bennett he said I thought that
you promised me that you would not let anyone into the house

I didnt let her in growled Mr Bennett Good heavens man she
climbed in at an upstairs window despite the presence on my grounds of
a policeman and a dog What is to be done with a woman like that

I do not understand what all this means I said addressing myself to
the doctor and ignoring Alexander Abraham entirely but if my presence
here is so extremely inconvenient to all concerned you can soon be
relieved of it I am going at once

I am very sorry my dear Peter said the doctor impressively
but that is just what I cannot allow you to do This house is under
quarantine for smallpox You will have to stay here

Smallpox For the first and last time in my life I openly lost my
temper with a man I wheeled furiously upon Alexander Abraham

Why didnt you tell me I cried

Tell you he said glaring at me When I first saw you it was too
late to tell you I thought the kindest thing I could do was to hold my
tongue and let you get away in happy ignorance This will teach you to
take a mans house by storm madam

Now now dont quarrel my good people interposed the doctor
seriouslybut I saw a twinkle in his eye Youll have to spend some
time together under the same roof and you wont improve the situation
by disagreeing You see Peter it was this way Mr Bennett was in
town yesterdaywhere as you are aware there is a bad outbreak of
smallpoxand took dinner in a boardinghouse where one of the maids
was ill Last night she developed unmistakable symptoms of smallpox The
Board of Health at once got after all the people who were in the
house yesterday so far as they could locate them and put them under
quarantine I came down here this morning and explained the matter to
Mr Bennett I brought Jeremiah Jeffries to guard the front of the house
and Mr Bennett gave me his word of honour that he would not let anyone
in by the back way while I went to get another policeman and make
all the necessary arrangements I have brought Thomas Wright and have
secured the services of another man to attend to Mr Bennetts barn work
and bring provisions to the house Jacob Green and Cleophas Lee will
watch at night I dont think there is much danger of Mr Bennetts
taking the smallpox but until we are sure you must remain here Peter

While listening to the doctor I had been thinking It was the most
distressing predicament I had ever got into in my life but there was no
sense in making it worse

Very well doctor I said calmly Yes I was vaccinated a month
ago when the news of the smallpox first came When you go back through
Avonlea kindly go to Sarah Pye and ask her to live in my house during
my absence and look after things especially the cats Tell her to give
them new milk twice a day and a square inch of butter apiece once a
week Get her to put my two dark print wrappers some aprons and some
changes of underclothing in my third best valise and have it sent down
to me My pony is tied out there to the fence Please take him home
That is all I think

No it isnt all said Alexander Abraham grumpily Send that
cat home too I wont have a cat around the placeId rather have
smallpox

I looked Alexander Abraham over gradually in a way I have beginning at
his feet and traveling up to his head I took my time over it and then
I said very quietly

You may have both Anyway youll have to have William Adolphus He is
under quarantine as well as you and I Do you suppose I am going to have
my cat ranging at large through Avonlea scattering smallpox germs among
innocent people Ill have to put up with that dog of yours You will
have to endure William Adolphus

Alexander Abraham groaned but I could see that the way I had looked him
over had chastened him considerably

The doctor drove away and I went into the house not choosing to linger
outside and be grinned at by Thomas Wright I hung my coat up in the
hall and laid my bonnet carefully on the sittingroom table having
first dusted a clean place for it with my handkerchief I longed to fall
upon that house at once and clean it up but I had to wait until the
doctor came back with my wrapper I could not clean house in my new suit
and a silk shirtwaist

Alexander Abraham was sitting on a chair looking at me Presently he
said

I am NOT curiousbut will you kindly tell me why the doctor called you
Peter

Because that is my name I suppose I answered shaking up a cushion
for William Adolphus and thereby disturbing the dust of years

Alexander Abraham coughed gently

Isnt thatahemrather a peculiar name for a woman

It is I said wondering how much soap if any there was in the
house

I am NOT curious said Alexander Abraham but would you mind telling
me how you came to be called Peter

If I had been a boy my parents intended to call me Peter in honour of
a rich uncle When Ifortunatelyturned out to be a girl my mother
insisted that I should be called Angelina They gave me both names and
called me Angelina but as soon as I grew old enough I decided to be
called Peter It was bad enough but not so bad as Angelina

I should say it was more appropriate said Alexander Abraham
intending as I perceived to be disagreeable

Precisely I agreed calmly My last name is MacPherson and I live
in Avonlea As you are NOT curious that will be all the information you
will need about me

Oh Alexander Abraham looked as if a light had broken in on him Ive
heard of you Youahpretend to dislike men

Pretend Goodness only knows what would have happened to Alexander
Abraham just then if a diversion had not taken place But the door
opened and a dog came inTHE dog I suppose he had got tired waiting
under the cherry tree for William Adolphus and me to come down He was
even uglier indoors than out

Oh Mr Riley Mr Riley see what you have let me in for said
Alexander Abraham reproachfully

But Mr Rileysince that was the brutes namepaid no attention to
Alexander Abraham He had caught sight of William Adolphus curled up on
the cushion and he started across the room to investigate him William
Adolphus sat up and began to take notice

Call off that dog I said warningly to Alexander Abraham

Call him off yourself he retorted Since youve brought that cat
here you can protect him

Oh it wasnt for William Adolphus sake I spoke I said pleasantly
William Adolphus can protect himself

William Adolphus could and did He humped his back flattened his ears
swore once and then made a flying leap for Mr Riley William Adolphus
landed squarely on Mr Rileys brindled back and promptly took fast
hold spitting and clawing and caterwauling

You never saw a more astonished dog than Mr Riley With a yell of
terror he bolted out to the kitchen out of the kitchen into the hall
through the hall into the room and so into the kitchen and round again
With each circuit he went faster and faster until he looked like a
brindled streak with a dash of black and white on top Such a racket
and commotion I never heard and I laughed until the tears came into
my eyes Mr Riley flew around and around and William Adolphus held on
grimly and clawed Alexander Abraham turned purple with rage

Woman call off that infernal cat before he kills my dog he shouted
above the din of yelps and yowls

Oh he wont kill him I said reassuringly and hes going too fast
to hear me if I did call him If you can stop the dog Mr Bennett Ill
guarantee to make William Adolphus listen to reason but theres no use
trying to argue with a lightning flash

Alexander Abraham made a frantic lunge at the brindled streak as it
whirled past him with the result that he overbalanced himself and went
sprawling on the floor with a crash I ran to help him up which only
seemed to enrage him further

Woman he spluttered viciously I wish you and your fiend of a cat
were inin

In Avonlea I finished quickly to save Alexander Abraham from
committing profanity So do I Mr Bennett with all my heart But
since we are not let us make the best of it like sensible people And
in future you will kindly remember that my name is Miss MacPherson NOT
Woman

With this the end came and I was thankful for the noise those two
animals made was so terrific that I expected the policeman would be
rushing in smallpox or no smallpox to see if Alexander Abraham and I
were trying to murder each other Mr Riley suddenly veered in his mad
career and bolted into a dark corner between the stove and the woodbox
William Adolphus let go just in time

There never was any more trouble with Mr Riley after that A meeker
more thoroughly chastened dog you could not find William Adolphus had
the best of it and he kept it

Seeing that things had calmed down and that it was five oclock I
decided to get tea I told Alexander Abraham that I would prepare it if
he would show me where the eatables were

You neednt mind said Alexander Abraham Ive been in the habit of
getting my own tea for twenty years

I daresay But you havent been in the habit of getting mine I said
firmly I wouldnt eat anything you cooked if I starved to death If
you want some occupation youd better get some salve and anoint the
scratches on that poor dogs back

Alexander Abraham said something that I prudently did not hear Seeing
that he had no information to hand out I went on an exploring expedition
into the pantry The place was awful beyond description and for the
first time a vague sentiment of pity for Alexander Abraham glimmered in
my breast When a man had to live in such surroundings the wonder was
not that he hated women but that he didnt hate the whole human race

But I got up a supper somehow I am noted for getting up suppers The
bread was from the Carmody bakery and I made good tea and excellent
toast besides I found a can of peaches in the pantry which as they
were bought I wasnt afraid to eat

That tea and toast mellowed Alexander Abraham in spite of himself He
ate the last crust and didnt growl when I gave William Adolphus all
the cream that was left Mr Riley did not seem to want anything He had
no appetite

By this time the doctors boy had arrived with my valise Alexander
Abraham gave me quite civilly to understand that there was a spare room
across the hall and that I might take possession of it I went to it and
put on a wrapper There was a set of fine furniture in the room and a
comfortable bed But the dust William Adolphus had followed me in and
his paws left marks everywhere he walked

Now I said briskly returning to the kitchen Im going to clean up
and I shall begin with this kitchen Youd better betake yourself to the
sittingroom Mr Bennett so as to be out of the way

Alexander Abraham glared at me

Im not going to have my house meddled with he snapped It suits me
If you dont like it you can leave it

No I cant That is just the trouble I said pleasantly If I could
leave it I shouldnt be here for a minute Since I cant it simply has
to be cleaned I can tolerate men and dogs when I am compelled to but
I cannot and will not tolerate dirt and disorder Go into the
sittingroom

Alexander Abraham went As he closed the door I heard him say in
capitals WHAT AN AWFUL WOMAN

I cleared that kitchen and the pantry adjoining It was ten oclock when
I got through and Alexander Abraham had gone to bed without deigning
further speech I locked Mr Riley in one room and William Adolphus in
another and went to bed too I had never felt so dead tired in my life
before It had been a hard day

But I got up bright and early the next morning and got a tiptop
breakfast which Alexander Abraham condescended to eat When the
provision man came into the yard I called to him from the window
to bring me a box of soap in the afternoon and then I tackled the
sittingroom

It took me the best part of a week to get that house in order but I did
it thoroughly I am noted for doing things thoroughly At the end of
the time it was clean from garret to cellar Alexander Abraham made no
comments on my operations though he groaned loud and often and said
caustic things to poor Mr Riley who hadnt the spirit to answer back
after his drubbing by William Adolphus I made allowances for Alexander
Abraham because his vaccination had taken and his arm was real sore
and I cooked elegant meals not having much else to do once I had got
things scoured up The house was full of provisionsAlexander Abraham
wasnt mean about such things I will say that for him Altogether I
was more comfortable than I had expected to be When Alexander Abraham
wouldnt talk I let him alone and when he would I just said as
sarcastic things as he did only I said them smiling and pleasant I
could see he had a wholesome awe for me But now and then he seemed to
forget his disposition and talked like a human being We had one or two
real interesting conversations Alexander Abraham was an intelligent
man though he had got terribly warped I told him once I thought he
must have been nice when he was a boy

One day he astonished me by appearing at the dinner table with his hair
brushed and a white collar on We had a tiptop dinner that day and
I had made a pudding that was far too good for a woman hater When
Alexander Abraham had disposed of two large platefuls of it he sighed
and said

You can certainly cook Its a pity you are such a detestable crank in
other respects

Its kind of convenient being a crank I said People are careful
how they meddle with you Havent you found that out in your own
experience

I am NOT a crank growled Alexander Abraham resentfully All I ask is
to be let alone

Thats the very crankiest kind of crank I said A person who wants
to be let alone flies in the face of Providence who decreed that folks
for their own good were not to be let alone But cheer up Mr Bennett
The quarantine will be up on Tuesday and then youll certainly be let
alone for the rest of your natural life as far as William Adolphus and
I are concerned You may then return to your wallowing in the mire and
be as dirty and comfortable as of yore

Alexander Abraham growled again The prospect didnt seem to cheer him
up as much as I should have expected Then he did an amazing thing He
poured some cream into a saucer and set it down before William Adolphus
William Adolphus lapped it up keeping one eye on Alexander Abraham lest
the latter should change his mind Not to be outdone I handed Mr Riley
a bone

Neither Alexander Abraham nor I had worried much about the smallpox We
didnt believe he would take it for he hadnt even seen the girl who
was sick But the very next morning I heard him calling me from the
upstairs landing

Miss MacPherson he said in a voice so uncommonly mild that it gave me
an uncanny feeling what are the symptoms of smallpox

Chills and flushes pain in the limbs and back nausea and vomiting
I answered promptly for I had been reading them up in a patent medicine
almanac

Ive got them all said Alexander Abraham hollowly

I didnt feel as much scared as I should have expected After enduring a
woman hater and a brindled dog and the early disorder of that houseand
coming off best with all threesmallpox seemed rather insignificant I
went to the window and called to Thomas Wright to send for the doctor

The doctor came down from Alexander Abrahams room looking grave

Its impossible to pronounce on the disease yet he said There is
no certainty until the eruption appears But of course there is every
likelihood that it is the smallpox It is very unfortunate I am afraid
that it will be difficult to get a nurse All the nurses in town who
will take smallpox cases are overbusy now for the epidemic is still
raging there However Ill go into town tonight and do my best
Meanwhile at present you must not go near him Peter

I wasnt going to take orders from any man and as soon as the doctor
had gone I marched straight up to Alexander Abrahams room with some
dinner for him on a tray There was a lemon cream I thought he could eat
even if he had the smallpox

You shouldnt come near me he growled You are risking your life

I am not going to see a fellow creature starve to death even if he is
a man I retorted

The worst of it all groaned Alexander Abraham between mouthfuls of
lemon cream is that the doctor says Ive got to have a nurse Ive got
so kind of used to you being in the house that I dont mind you but the
thought of another woman coming here is too much Did you give my poor
dog anything to eat

He has had a better dinner than many a Christian I said severely

Alexander Abraham need not have worried about another woman coming in
The doctor came back that night with care on his brow

I dont know what is to be done he said I cant get a soul to come
here

_I_ shall nurse Mr Bennett I said with dignity It is my duty and
I never shirk my duty I am noted for that He is a man and he has
smallpox and he keeps a vile dog but I am not going to see him die for
lack of care for all that

Youre a good soul Peter said the doctor looking relieved manlike
as soon as he found a woman to shoulder the responsibility

I nursed Alexander Abraham through the smallpox and I didnt mind it
much He was much more amiable sick than well and he had the disease
in a very mild form Below stairs I reigned supreme and Mr Riley and
William Adolphus lay down together like the lion and the lamb I fed
Mr Riley regularly and once seeing him looking lonesome I patted him
gingerly It was nicer than I thought it would be Mr Riley lifted his
head and looked at me with an expression in his eyes which cured me of
wondering why on earth Alexander Abraham was so fond of the beast

When Alexander Abraham was able to sit up he began to make up for the
time hed lost being pleasant Anything more sarcastic than that man in
his convalescence you couldnt imagine I just laughed at him having
found out that that could be depended on to irritate him To irritate
him still further I cleaned the house all over again But what vexed him
most of all was that Mr Riley took to following me about and wagging
what he had of a tail at me

It wasnt enough that you should come into my peaceful home and turn
it upside down but you have to alienate the affections of my dog
complained Alexander Abraham

Hell get fond of you again when I go home I said comfortingly Dogs
arent very particular that way What they want is bones Cats now
they love disinterestedly William Adolphus has never swerved in his
allegiance to me although you do give him cream in the pantry on the
sly

Alexander Abraham looked foolish He hadnt thought I knew that

I didnt take the smallpox and in another week the doctor came out and
sent the policeman home I was disinfected and William Adolphus was
fumigated and then we were free to go

Goodbye Mr Bennett I said offering to shake hands in a forgiving
spirit Ive no doubt that you are glad to be rid of me but you are no
gladder than I am to go I suppose this house will be dirtier than ever
in a months time and Mr Riley will have discarded the little polish
his manners have taken on Reformation with men and dogs never goes very
deep

With this Parthian shaft I walked out of the house supposing that I had
seen the last of it and Alexander Abraham

I was glad to get back home of course but it did seem queer and
lonesome The cats hardly knew me and William Adolphus roamed about
forlornly and appeared to feel like an exile I didnt take as much
pleasure in cooking as usual for it seemed kind of foolish to be
fussing over oneself The sight of a bone made me think of poor Mr
Riley The neighbours avoided me pointedly for they couldnt get rid
of the fear that I might erupt into smallpox at any moment My Sunday
School class had been given to another woman and altogether I felt as
if I didnt belong anywhere

I had existed like this for a fortnight when Alexander Abraham suddenly
appeared He walked in one evening at dusk but at first sight I didnt
know him he was so spruced and barbered up But William Adolphus knew
him Will you believe it William Adolphus my own William Adolphus
rubbed up against that mans trouser leg with an undisguised purr of
satisfaction

I had to come Angelina said Alexander Abraham I couldnt stand it
any longer

My name is Peter I said coldly although I was feeling ridiculously
glad about something

It isnt said Alexander Abraham stubbornly It is Angelina for me
and always will be I shall never call you Peter Angelina just suits
you exactly and Angelina Bennett would suit you still better You must
come back Angelina Mr Riley is moping for you and I cant get along
without somebody to appreciate my sarcasms now that you have accustomed
me to the luxury

What about the other five cats I demanded

Alexander Abraham sighed

I suppose theyll have to come too he sighed though no doubt
theyll chase poor Mr Riley clean off the premises But I can live
without him and I cant without you How soon can you be ready to marry
me

I havent said that I was going to marry you at all have I I said
tartly just to be consistent For I wasnt feeling tart

No but you will wont you said Alexander Abraham anxiously
Because if you wont I wish youd let me die of the smallpox Do dear
Angelina

To think that a man should dare to call me his dear Angelina And to
think that I shouldnt mind

Where I go William Adolphus goes I said but I shall give away the
other five cats forfor the sake of Mr Riley




IX Pa Sloanes Purchase


I guess the molasses is getting low aint it said Pa Sloane
insinuatingly Spose Id better drive up to Carmody this afternoon and
get some more

Theres a good halfgallon of molasses in the jug yet said ma Sloane
ruthlessly

That so Well I noticed the kerosene demijohn wasnt very hefty the
last time I filled the can Reckon it needs replenishing

We have kerosene enough to do for a fortnight yet Ma continued to eat
her dinner with an impassive face but a twinkle made itself apparent in
her eye Lest Pa should see it and feel encouraged thereby she looked
immovably at her plate

Pa Sloane sighed His invention was giving out

Didnt I hear you say day before yesterday that you were out of
nutmegs he queried after a few moments severe reflection

I got a supply of them from the eggpedlar yesterday responded Ma
by a great effort preventing the twinkle from spreading over her entire
face She wondered if this third failure would squelch Pa But Pa was
not to be squelched

Well anyway he said brightening up under the influence of a sudden
saving inspiration Ill have to go up to get the sorrel mare shod So
if youve any little errands you want done at the store Ma just make a
memo of them while I hitch up

The matter of shoeing the sorrel mare was beyond Mas province although
she had her own suspicions about the sorrel mares need of shoes

Why cant you give up beating about the bush Pa she demanded
with contemptuous pity You might as well own up whats taking you to
Carmody _I_ can see through your design You want to get away to the
Garland auction That is what is troubling you Pa Sloane

I dunno but what I might step over seeing its so handy But the
sorrel mare really does need shoeing Ma protested Pa

Theres always something needing to be done if its convenient
retorted Ma Your mania for auctions will be the ruin of you yet Pa
A man of fiftyfive ought to have grown out of such a hankering But
the older you get the worse you get Anyway if _I_ wanted to go to
auctions Id select them as was something like and not waste my time
on little onehorse affairs like this of Garlands

One might pick up something real cheap at Garlands said Pa
defensively

Well you are not going to pick up anything cheap or otherwise Pa
Sloane because Im going with you to see that you dont I know I cant
stop you from going I might as well try to stop the wind from blowing
But I shall go too out of selfdefence This house is so full now of
old clutter and truck that youve brought home from auctions that I feel
as if I was made up out of pieces and left overs

Pa Sloane sighed again It was not exhilarating to attend an auction
with Ma She would never let him bid on anything But he realized that
Mas mind was made up beyond the power of mortal mans persuasion to
alter it so he went out to hitch up

Pa Sloanes dissipation was going to auctions and buying things that
nobody else would buy Ma Sloanes patient endeavours of over thirty
years had been able to effect only a partial reform Sometimes Pa
heroically refrained from going to an auction for six months at a time
then he would break out worse than ever go to all that took place for
miles around and come home with a wagonful of misfits His last exploit
had been to bid on an old dasher churn for five dollarsthe boys ran
things up on Pa Sloane for the fun of itand bring it home to outraged
Ma who had made her butter for fifteen years in the very latest most
uptodate barrel churn To add insult to injury this was the second
dasher churn Pa had bought at auction That settled it Ma decreed that
henceforth she would chaperon Pa when he went to auctions

But this was the day of Pas good angel When he drove up to the door
where Ma was waiting a breathless hatless imp of ten flew into the
yard and hurled himself between Ma and the wagonstep

Oh Mrs Sloane wont you come over to our house at once he gasped
The baby hes got colic and mas just wild and hes all black in the
face

Ma went feeling that the stars in their courses fought against a woman
who was trying to do her duty by her husband But first she admonished
Pa

I shall have to let you go alone But I charge you Pa not to bid on
anythingon ANYTHING do you hear

Pa heard and promised to heed with every intention of keeping his
promise Then he drove away joyfully On any other occasion Ma would
have been a welcome companion But she certainly spoiled the flavour of
an auction

When Pa arrived at the Carmody store he saw that the little yard of the
Garland place below the hill was already full of people The auction had
evidently begun so not to miss any more of it Pa hurried down The
sorrel mare could wait for her shoes until afterwards

Ma had been within bounds when she called the Garland auction a
onehorse affair It certainly was very paltry especially when
compared to the big Donaldson auction of a month ago which Pa still
lived over in happy dreams

Horace Garland and his wife had been poor When they died within six
weeks of each other one of consumption and one of pneumonia they left
nothing but debts and a little furniture The house had been a rented
one

The bidding on the various poor articles of household gear put up
for sale was not brisk but had an element of resigned determination
Carmody people knew that these things had to be sold to pay the debts
and they could not be sold unless they were bought Still it was a very
tame affair

A woman came out of the house carrying a baby of about eighteen months
in her arms and sat down on the bench beneath the window

Theres Marthy Blair with the Garland Baby said Robert Lawson to Pa
Id like to know whats to become of that poor young one

Aint there any of the fathers or mothers folks to take him asked
Pa

No Horace had no relatives that anybody ever heard of Mrs Horace had
a brother but he went to Manitoba years ago and nobody knows where he
is now Somebodyll have to take the baby and nobody seems anxious to
Ive got eight myself or Id think about it Hes a fine little chap

Pa with Mas parting admonition ringing in his ears did not bid on
anything although it will never be known how great was the heroic
selfrestraint he put on himself until just at the last when he did
bid on a collection of flowerpots thinking he might indulge himself to
that small extent But Josiah Sloane had been commissioned by his wife
to bring those flowerpots home to her so Pa lost them

There thats all said the auctioneer wiping his face for the day
was very warm for October

Theres nothing more unless we sell the baby

A laugh went through the crowd The sale had been a dull affair and
they were ready for some fun Someone called out Put him up Jacob
The joke found favour and the call was repeated hilariously

Jacob Blair took little Teddy Garland out of Marthas arms and stood him
up on the table by the door steadying the small chap with one big brown
hand The baby had a mop of yellow curls and a pink and white face and
big blue eyes He laughed out at the men before him and waved his hands
in delight Pa Sloane thought he had never seen so pretty a baby

Heres a baby for sale shouted the auctioneer A genuine article
pretty near as good as brandnew A real live baby warranted to walk
and talk a little Who bids A dollar Did I hear anyone mean enough to
bid a dollar No sir babies dont come as cheap as that especially
the curlyheaded brand

The crowd laughed again Pa Sloane by way of keeping on the joke
cried Four dollars

Everybody looked at him The impression flashed through the crowd that
Pa was in earnest and meant thus to signify his intention of giving
the baby a home He was welltodo and his only son was grown up and
married

Six cried out John Clarke from the other side of the yard John
Clarke lived at White Sands and he and his wife were childless

That bid of John Clarkes was Pas undoing Pa Sloane could not have an
enemy but a rival he had and that rival was John Clarke Everywhere at
auctions John Clarke was wont to bid against Pa At the last auction he
had outbid Pa in everything not having the fear of his wife before his
eyes Pas fighting blood was up in a moment he forgot Ma Sloane
he forgot what he was bidding for he forgot everything except a
determination that John Clarke should not be victor again

Ten he called shrilly

Fifteen shouted Clarke

Twenty vociferated Pa

Twentyfive bellowed Clarke

Thirty shrieked Pa He nearly bust a bloodvessel in his shrieking
but he had won Clarke turned off with a laugh and a shrug and the baby
was knocked down to Pa Sloane by the auctioneer who had meanwhile been
keeping the crowd in roars of laughter by a quick fire of witticisms
There had not been such fun at an auction in Carmody for many a long
day

Pa Sloane came or was pushed forward The baby was put into his arms
he realized that he was expected to keep it and he was too dazed to
refuse besides his heart went out to the child

The auctioneer looked doubtfully at the money which Pa laid mutely down

I spose that part was only a joke he said

Not a bit of it said Robert Lawson All the money wont be too much
to pay the debts Theres a doctors bill and this will just about pay
it

Pa Sloane drove back home with the sorrel mare still unshod the baby
and the babys meager bundle of clothes The baby did not trouble him
much it had become well used to strangers in the past two months and
promptly fell asleep on his arm but Pa Sloane did not enjoy that drive
at the end of it he mentally saw Ma Sloane

Ma was there too waiting for him on the back doorstep as he drove
into the yard at sunset Her face when she saw the baby expressed the
last degree of amazement

Pa Sloane she demanded whose is that young one and where did you
get it

IIbought it at the auction Ma said Pa feebly Then he waited for
the explosion None came This last exploit of Pas was too much for Ma

With a gasp she snatched the baby from Pas arms and ordered him to go
out and put the mare in When Pa returned to the kitchen Ma had set the
baby on the sofa fenced him around with chairs so that he couldnt fall
off and given him a molassed cooky

Now Pa Sloane you can explain she said

Pa explained Ma listened in grim silence until he had finished Then
she said sternly

Do you reckon were going to keep this baby

IIdunno said Pa And he didnt

Well were NOT I brought up one boy and thats enough I dont
calculate to be pestered with any more I never was much struck on
children _as_ children anyhow You say that Mary Garland had a brother
out in Manitoba Well we shall just write to him and tell him hes got
to look out for his nephew

But how can you do that Ma when nobody knows his address objected
Pa with a wistful look at that delicious laughing baby

Ill find out his address if I have to advertise in the papers for
him retorted Ma As for you Pa Sloane youre not fit to be out of a
lunatic asylum The next auction youll be buying a wife I spose

Pa quite crushed by Mas sarcasm pulled his chair in to supper Ma
picked up the baby and sat down at the head of the table Little Teddy
laughed and pinched her faceMas face Ma looked very grim but she
fed him his supper as skilfully as if it had not been thirty years
since she had done such a thing But then the woman who once learns the
mother knack never forgets it

After tea Ma despatched Pa over to William Alexanders to borrow a high
chair When Pa returned in the twilight the baby was fenced in on
the sofa again and Ma was stepping briskly about the garret She was
bringing down the little cot bed her own boy had once occupied and
setting it up in their room for Teddy Then she undressed the baby and
rocked him to sleep crooning an old lullaby over him Pa Sloane sat
quietly and listened with very sweet memories of the long ago when he
and Ma had been young and proud and the bewhiskered William Alexander
had been a curlyheaded little fellow like this one

Ma was not driven to advertising for Mrs Garlands brother That
personage saw the notice of his sisters death in a home paper and wrote
to the Carmody postmaster for full information The letter was referred
to Ma and Ma answered it

She wrote that they had taken in the baby pending further arrangements
but had no intention of keeping it and she calmly demanded of its uncle
what was to be done with it Then she sealed and addressed the letter
with an unfaltering hand but when it was done she looked across the
table at Pa Sloane who was sitting in the armchair with the baby on his
knee They were having a royal good time together Pa had always been
dreadfully foolish about babies He looked ten years younger Mas keen
eyes softened a little as she watched them

A prompt answer came to her letter Teddys uncle wrote that he had six
children of his own but was nevertheless willing and glad to give his
little nephew a home But he could not come after him Josiah Spencer
of White Sands was going out to Manitoba in the spring If Mr and Mrs
Sloane could only keep the baby till then he could be sent out with the
Spencers Perhaps they would see a chance sooner

Therell be no chance sooner said Pa Sloane in a tone of
satisfaction

No worse luck retorted Ma crisply

The winter passed by Little Teddy grew and throve and Pa Sloane
worshipped him Ma was very good to him too and Teddy was just as fond
of her as of Pa

Nevertheless as the spring drew near Pa became depressed Sometimes he
sighed heavily especially when he heard casual references to the Josiah
Spencer emigration

One warm afternoon in early May Josiah Spencer arrived He found Ma
knitting placidly in the kitchen while Pa nodded over his newspaper and
the baby played with the cat on the floor

Good afternoon Mrs Sloane said Josiah with a flourish I just
dropped in to see about this young man here We are going to leave next
Wednesday so youd better send him down to our place Monday or Tuesday
so that he can get used to us and

Oh Ma began Pa rising imploringly to his feet

Ma transfixed him with her eye

Sit down Pa she commanded

Unhappy Pa sat

Then Ma glared at the smiling Josiah who instantly felt as guilty as if
he had been caught stealing sheep redhanded

We are much obliged to you Mr Spencer said Ma icily but this baby
is OURS We bought him and we paid for him A bargain is a bargain
When I pay cash down for babies I propose to get my moneys worth
We are going to keep this baby in spite of any number of uncles in
Manitoba Have I made this sufficiently clear to your understanding Mr
Spencer

Certainly certainly stammered the unfortunate man feeling guiltier
than ever but I thought you didnt want himI thought youd written
to his uncleI thought

I really wouldnt think quite so much if I were you said Ma kindly
It must be hard on you Wont you stay and have tea with us

But no Josiah would not stay He was thankful to make his escape with
such rags of selfrespect as remained to him

Pa Sloane arose and came around to Mas chair He laid a trembling hand
on her shoulder

Ma youre a good woman he said softly

Go long Pa said Ma





X The Courting of Prissy Strong


I WASNT able to go to prayer meeting that evening because I had
neuralgia in my face but Thomas went and the minute he came home I
knew by the twinkle in his eye that he had some news

Who do you spose Stephen Clark went home with from meeting tonight
he said chuckling

Jane Miranda Blair I said promptly Stephen Clarks wife had been
dead for two years and he hadnt taken much notice of anybody so far as
was known But Carmody had Jane Miranda all ready for him and really
I dont know why she didnt suit him except for the reason that a man
never does what he is expected to do when it comes to marrying

Thomas chuckled again

Wrong He stepped up to Prissy Strong and walked off with her Cold
soup warmed over

Prissy Strong I just held up my hands Then I laughed He neednt
try for Prissy I said Emmeline nipped that in the bud twenty years
ago and shell do it again

Emline is an old crank growled Thomas He detested Emmeline Strong
and always did

Shes that all right I agreed and that is just the reason she can
turn poor Prissy any way she likes You mark my words shell put her
foot right down on this as soon as she finds it out

Thomas said that I was probably right I lay awake for a long time after
I went to bed that night thinking of Prissy and Stephen As a general
rule I dont concern my head about other peoples affairs but Prissy
was such a helpless creature I couldnt get her off my mind

Twenty years ago Stephen Clark had tried to go with Prissy Strong That
was pretty soon after Prissys father had died She and Emmeline were
living alone together Emmeline was thirty ten years older than Prissy
and if ever there were two sisters totally different from each other in
every way those two were Emmeline and Prissy Strong

Emmeline took after her father she was big and dark and homely and she
was the most domineering creature that ever stepped on shoe leather She
simply ruled poor Prissy with a rod of iron

Prissy herself was a pretty girlat least most people thought so
I cant honestly say I ever admired her style much myself I like
something with more vim and snap to it Prissy was slim and pink with
soft appealing blue eyes and pale gold hair all clinging in baby rings
around her face She was just as meek and timid as she looked and there
wasnt a bit of harm in her I always liked Prissy even if I didnt
admire her looks as much as some people did

Anyway it was plain her style suited Stephen Clark He began to drive
her and there wasnt a speck of doubt that Prissy liked him Then
Emmeline just put a stopper on the affair It was pure cantankerousness
in her Stephen was a good match and nothing could be said against
him But Emmeline was just determined that Prissy shouldnt marry She
couldnt get married herself and she was sore enough about it

Of course if Prissy had had a spark of spirit she wouldnt have given
in But she hadnt a mite I believe she would have cut off her nose if
Emmeline had ordered her to do it She was just her mother over again
If ever a girl belied her name Prissy Strong did There wasnt anything
strong about her

One night when prayer meeting came out Stephen stepped up to Prissy
as usual and asked if he might see her home Thomas and I were just
behindwe werent married ourselves thenand we heard it all Prissy
gave one scared appealing look at Emmeline and then said No thank
you not tonight

Stephen just turned on his heel and went He was a highspirited fellow
and I knew he would never overlook a public slight like that If he
had had as much sense as he ought to have had he would have known that
Emmeline was at the bottom of it but he didnt and he began going to
see Althea Gillis and they were married the next year Althea was a
rather nice girl though giddy and I think she and Stephen were happy
enough together In real life things are often like that

Nobody ever tried to go with Prissy again I suppose they were afraid
of Emmeline Prissys beauty soon faded She was always kind of sweet
looking but her bloom went and she got shyer and limper every year of
her life She wouldnt have dared put on her second best dress without
asking Emmelines permission She was real fond of cats and Emmeline
wouldnt let her keep one Emmeline even cut the serial out of the
religious weekly she took before she would give it to Prissy because
she didnt believe in reading novels It used to make me furious to see
it all They were my next door neighbours after I married Thomas and I
was often in and out Sometimes Id feel real vexed at Prissy for giving
in the way she did but after all she couldnt help itshe was born
that way

And now Stephen was going to try his luck again It certainly did seem
funny

Stephen walked home with Prissy from prayer meeting four nights before
Emmeline found it out Emmeline hadnt been going to prayer meeting all
that summer because she was mad at Mr Leonard She had expressed her
disapproval to him because he had buried old Naomi Clark at the harbour
just as if she was a Christian and Mr Leonard had said something to
her she couldnt get over for a while I dont know what it was but
I know that when Mr Leonard WAS roused to rebuke anyone the person so
rebuked remembered it for a spell

All at once I knew she must have discovered about Stephen and Prissy
for Prissy stopped going to prayer meeting

I felt real worried about it someway and although Thomas said for
goodness sake not to go poking my fingers into other peoples pies
I felt as if I ought to do something Stephen Clark was a good man
and Prissy would have a beautiful home and those two little boys of
Altheas needed a mother if ever boys did Besides I knew quite well
that Prissy in her secret soul was hankering to be married So was
Emmeline toobut nobody wanted to help HER to a husband

The upshot of my meditations was that I asked Stephen down to dinner
with us from church one day I had heard a rumour that he was going to
see Lizzie Pye over at Avonlea and I knew it was time to be stirring
if anything were to be done If it had been Jane Miranda I dont
know that Id have bothered but Lizzie Pye wouldnt have done for a
stepmother for Altheas boys at all She was too badtempered and as
mean as second skimmings besides

Stephen came He seemed dull and moody and not much inclined to talk
After dinner I gave Thomas a hint I said

You go to bed and have your nap I want to talk to Stephen

Thomas shrugged his shoulders and went He probably thought I was
brewing up lots of trouble for myself but he didnt say anything As
soon as he was out of the way I casually remarked to Stephen that I
understood that he was going to take one of my neighbours away and that
I couldnt be sorry though she was an excellent neighbour and I would
miss her a great deal

You wont have to miss her much I reckon said Stephen grimly Ive
been told Im not wanted there

I was surprised to hear Stephen come out so plump and plain about
it for I hadnt expected to get at the root of the matter so easily
Stephen wasnt the confidential kind But it really seemed to be a
relief to him to talk about it I never saw a man feeling so sore about
anything He told me the whole story

Prissy had written him a letterhe fished it out of his pocket and gave
it to me to read It was in Prissys prim pretty little writing sure
enough and it just said that his attentions were unwelcome and would
he be kind enough to refrain from offering them Not much wonder the
poor man went to see Lizzie Pye

Stephen Im surprised at you for thinking that Prissy Strong wrote
that letter I said

Its in her handwriting he said stubbornly

Of course it is The hand is the hand of Esau but the voice is the
voice of Jacob I said though I wasnt sure whether the quotation was
exactly appropriate Emmeline composed that letter and made Prissy copy
it out I know that as well as if Id seen her do it and you ought to
have known it too

If I thought that Id show Emmeline I could get Prissy in spite of
her said Stephen savagely But if Prissy doesnt want me Im not
going to force my attentions on her

Well we talked it over a bit and in the end I agreed to sound Prissy
and find out what she really thought about it I didnt think it would
be hard to do and it wasnt I went over the very next day because
I saw Emmeline driving off to the store I found Prissy alone sewing
carpet rags Emmeline kept her constantly at thatbecause Prissy hated
it I suppose Prissy was crying when I went in and in a few minutes I
had the whole story

Prissy wanted to get marriedand she wanted to get married to
Stephenand Emmeline wouldnt let her

Prissy Strong I said in exasperation you havent the spirit of a
mouse Why on earth did you write him such a letter

Why Emmeline made me said Prissy as if there couldnt be any appeal
from that and I knew there couldntfor Prissy I also knew that if
Stephen wanted to see Prissy again Emmeline must know nothing of it and
I told him so when he came down the next eveningto borrow a hoe he
said It was a long way to come for a hoe

Then what am I to do he said It wouldnt be any use to write for
it would likely fall into Emmelines hands She wont let Prissy go
anywhere alone after this and how am I to know when the old cat is
away

Please dont insult cats I said Ill tell you what well do You
can see the ventilator on our barn from your place cant you Youd be
able to make out a flag or something tied to it wouldnt you through
that spyglass of yours

Stephen thought he could

Well you take a squint at it every now and then I said Just as
soon as Emmeline leaves Prissy alone Ill hoist the signal

The chance didnt come for a whole fortnight Then one evening I saw
Emmeline striding over the field below our house As soon as she was out
of sight I ran through the birch grove to Prissy

Yes Emlines gone to sit up with Jane Lawson tonight said Prissy
all fluttered and trembling

Then you put on your muslin dress and fix your hair I said Im
going home to get Thomas to tie something to that ventilator

But do you think Thomas would do it Not he He said he owed something
to his position as elder in the church In the end I had to do it
myself though I dont like climbing ladders I tied Thomas long red
woollen scarf to the ventilator and prayed that Stephen would see it
He did for in less than an hour he drove down our lane and put his
horse in our barn He was all spruced up and as nervous and excited as
a schoolboy He went right over to Prissy and I began to tuft my new
comfort with a clear conscience I shall never know why it suddenly came
into my head to go up to the garret and make sure that the moths hadnt
got into my box of blankets but I always believed that it was a special
interposition of Providence I went up and happened to look out of the
east window and there I saw Emmeline Strong coming home across our pond
field

I just flew down those garret stairs and out through the birches I
burst into the Strong kitchen where Stephen and Prissy were sitting as
cozy as you please

Stephen come quick Emmelines nearly here I cried

Prissy looked out of the window and wrung her hands

Oh shes in the lane now she gasped He cant get out of the house
without her seeing him Oh Rosanna what shall we do

I really dont know what would have become of those two people if I
hadnt been in existence to find ideas for them

Take Stephen up to the garret and hide him there Prissy I said
firmly and take him quick

Prissy took him quick but she had barely time to get back to the
kitchen before Emmeline marched inmad as a wet hen because somebody
had been ahead of her offering to sit up with Jane Lawson and so she
lost the chance of poking and prying into things while Jane was asleep
The minute she clapped eyes on Prissy she suspected something It wasnt
any wonder for there was Prissy all dressed up with flushed cheeks
and shining eyes She was all in a quiver of excitement and looked ten
years younger

Priscilla Strong youve been expecting Stephen Clark here this
evening burst out Emmeline You wicked deceitful underhanded
ungrateful creature

And she went on storming at Prissy who began to cry and looked so weak
and babyish that I was frightened she would betray the whole thing

This is between you and Prissy Emmeline I struck in and Im not
going to interfere But I want to get you to come over and show me how
to tuft my comfort that new pattern you learned in Avonlea and as it
had better be done before dark I wish youd come right away

I spose Ill go said Emmeline ungraciously but Priscilla shall
come too for I see that she isnt to be trusted out of my sight after
this

I hoped Stephen would see us from the garret window and make good his
escape But I didnt dare trust to chance so when I got Emmeline safely
to work on my comfort I excused myself and slipped out Luckily my
kitchen was on the off side of the house but I was a nervous woman as I
rushed across to the Strong place and dashed up Emmelines garret stairs
to Stephen It was fortunate I had come for he didnt know we had gone
Prissy had hidden him behind the loom and he didnt dare move for
fear Emmeline would hear him on that creaky floor He was a sight with
cobwebs

I got him down and smuggled him into our barn and he stayed there until
it was dark and the Strong girls had gone home Emmeline began to rage
at Prissy the moment they were outside my door

Then Stephen came in and we talked things over He and Prissy had made
good use of their time short as it had been Prissy had promised to
marry him and all that remained was to get the ceremony performed

And that will be no easy matter I warned him Now that Emmelines
suspicions are aroused shell never let Prissy out of her sight until
youre married to another woman if its years I know Emmeline Strong
And I know Prissy If it was any other girl in the world shed run away
or manage it somehow but Prissy never will Shes too much in the habit
of obeying Emmeline Youll have an obedient wife Stephenif you ever
get her

Stephen looked as if he thought that wouldnt be any drawback Gossip
said that Althea had been pretty bossy I dont know Maybe it was so

Cant you suggest something Rosanna he implored Youve helped us
so far and Ill never forget it

The only thing I can think of is for you to have the license ready and
speak to Mr Leonard and keep an eye on our ventilator I said Ill
watch here and signal whenever theres an opening

Well I watched and Stephen watched and Mr Leonard was in the plot
too Prissy was always a favourite of his and he would have been more
than human saint as he is if hed had any love for Emmeline after the
way she was always trying to brew up strife in the church

But Emmeline was a match for us all She never let Prissy out of her
sight Everywhere she went she toted Prissy too When a month had gone
by I was almost in despair Mr Leonard had to leave for the Assembly
in another week and Stephens neighbours were beginning to talk about
him They said that a man who spent all his time hanging around the yard
with a spyglass and trusting everything to a hired boy couldnt be
altogether right in his mind

I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw Emmeline driving away one day
alone As soon as she was out of sight I whisked over and Anne Shirley
and Diana Barry went with me

They were visiting me that afternoon Dianas mother was my second
cousin and as we visited back and forth frequently Id often seen
Diana But Id never seen her chum Anne Shirley although Id heard
enough about her to drive anyone frantic with curiosity So when she
came home from Redmond College that summer I asked Diana to take pity on
me and bring her over some afternoon

I wasnt disappointed in her I considered her a beauty though some
people couldnt see it She had the most magnificent red hair and the
biggest shiningest eyes I ever saw in a girls head As for her laugh
it made me feel young again to hear it She and Diana both laughed
enough that afternoon for I told them under solemn promise of secrecy
all about poor Prissys love affair So nothing would do them but they
must go over with me

The appearance of the house amazed me All the shutters were closed and
the door locked I knocked and knocked but there was no answer Then I
walked around the house to the only window that hadnt shuttersa tiny
one upstairs I knew it was the window in the closet off the room where
the girls slept I stopped under it and called Prissy Before long
Prissy came and opened it She was so pale and woebegone looking that I
pitied her with all my heart

Prissy where has Emmeline gone I asked

Down to Avonlea to see the Roger Pyes Theyre sick with measles and
Emmeline couldnt take me because Ive never had measles

Poor Prissy She had never had anything a body ought to have

Then you just come and unfasten a shutter and come right over to my
house I said exultantly Well have Stephen and the minister here in
no time

I cantEmline has locked me in here said Prissy woefully

I was posed No living mortal bigger than a baby could have got in or
out of that closet window

Well I said finally Ill put the signal up for Stephen anyhow and
well see what can be done when he gets here

I didnt know how I was ever to get the signal up on that ventilator
for it was one of the days I take dizzy spells and if I took one up on
the ladder thered probably be a funeral instead of a wedding But Anne
Shirley said shed put it up for me and she did I had never seen that
girl before and Ive never seen her since but its my opinion that
there wasnt much she couldnt do if she made up her mind to do it

Stephen wasnt long in getting there and he brought the minister with
him Then we all including Thomaswho was beginning to get interested
in the affair in spite of himselfwent over and held council of war
beneath the closet window

Thomas suggested breaking in doors and carrying Prissy off boldly but
I could see that Mr Leonard looked very dubious over that and even
Stephen said he thought it could only be done as a last resort I agreed
with him I knew Emmeline Strong would bring an action against him
for housebreaking as likely as not Shed be so furious shed stick at
nothing if we gave her any excuse Then Anne Shirley who couldnt have
been more excited if she was getting married herself came to the rescue
again

Couldnt you put a ladder up to the closet window she said And
Mr Clark can go up it and they can be married there Cant they Mr
Leonard

Mr Leonard agreed that they could He was always the most saintly
looking man but I know I saw a twinkle in his eye

Thomas go over and bring our little ladder over here I said

Thomas forgot he was an elder and he brought the ladder as quick as it
was possible for a fat man to do it After all it was too short to reach
the window but there was no time to go for another Stephen went up to
the top of it and he reached up and Prissy reached down and they could
just barely clasp hands so I shall never forget the look of Prissy The
window was so small she could only get her head and one arm out of it
Besides she was almost frightened to death

Mr Leonard stood at the foot of the ladder and married them As a rule
he makes a very long and solemn thing of the marriage ceremony but this
time he cut out everything that wasnt absolutely necessary and it was
well that he did for just as he pronounced them man and wife Emmeline
drove into the lane

She knew perfectly well what had happened when she saw the minister with
his blue book in his hand Never a word said she She marched to the
front door unlocked it and strode upstairs Ive always been convinced
it was a mercy that closet window was so small or I believe that she
would have thrown Prissy out of it As it was she walked her downstairs
by the arm and actually flung her at Stephen

There take your wife she said and Ill pack up every stitch she
owns and send it after her and I never want to see her or you again as
long as I live

Then she turned to me and Thomas

As for you that have aided and abetted that weakminded fool in this
take yourselves out of my yard and never darken my door again

Goodness who wants to you old spitfire said Thomas

It wasnt just the thing for him to say perhaps but we are all human
even elders

The girls didnt escape Emmeline looked daggers at them

This will be something for you to carry back to Avonlea she said
You gossips down there will have enough to talk about for a spell
Thats all you ever go out of Avonlea forjust to fetch and carry
tales

Finally she finished up with the minister

Im going to the Baptist church in Spencervale after this she said
Her tone and look said a hundred other things She whirled into the
house and slammed the door

Mr Leonard looked around on us with a pitying smile as Stephen put
poor halffainting Prissy into the buggy

I am very sorry he said in that gently saintly way of his for the
Baptists





XI The Miracle at Carmody


Salome looked out of the kitchen window and a pucker of distress
appeared on her smooth forehead

Dear dear what has Lionel Hezekiah been doing now she murmured
anxiously

Involuntarily she reached out for her crutch but it was a little beyond
her reach having fallen on the floor and without it Salome could not
move a step

Well anyway Judith is bringing him in as fast as she can she
reflected He must have been up to something terrible this time for
she looks very cross and she never walks like that unless she is angry
clear through Dear me I am sometimes tempted to think that Judith and
I made a mistake in adopting the child I suppose two old maids dont
know much about bringing up a boy properly But he is NOT a bad child
and it really seems to me that there must be some way of making him
behave better if we only knew what it was

Salomes monologue was cut short by the entrance of her sister Judith
holding Lionel Hezekiah by his chubby wrist with a determined grip

Judith Marsh was ten years older than Salome and the two women were
as different in appearance as night and day Salome in spite of her
thirtyfive years looked almost girlish She was small and pink and
flowerlike with little rings of pale golden hair clustering all over
her head in a most unspinsterlike fashion and her eyes were big and
blue and mild as a doves Her face was perhaps a weak one but it was
very sweet and appealing

Judith Marsh was tall and dark with a plain tragic face and irongray
hair Her eyes were black and sombre and every feature bespoke
unyielding will and determination Just now she looked as Salome had
said angry clear through and the baleful glances she cast on the
small mortal she held would have withered a more hardened criminal than
six happygolucky years had made of Lionel Hezekiah

Lionel Hezekiah whatever his shortcomings did not look bad Indeed
he was as engaging an urchin as ever beamed out on a jolly good world
through a pair of big velvetbrown eyes He was chubby and firmlimbed
with a mop of beautiful golden curls which were the despair of his
heart and the pride and joy of Salomes and his round face was usually
a lurkingplace for dimples and smiles and sunshine

But just now Lionel Hezekiah was under a blight he had been caught
redhanded in guilt and was feeling much ashamed of himself He hung
his head and squirmed his toes under the mournful reproach in Salomes
eyes When Salome looked at him like that Lionel Hezekiah always felt
that he was paying more for his fun than it was worth

What do you suppose I caught him doing this time demanded Judith

II dont know faltered Salome

Firingatamarkonthehenhousedoorwithnewlaideggs
said Judith with measured distinctness He has broken every egg that
was laid today except three And as for the state of that henhouse
door

Judith paused with an indignant gesture meant to convey that the state
of the henhouse door must be left to Salomes imagination since the
English language was not capable of depicting it

O Lionel Hezekiah why will you do such things said Salome miserably

Ididnt know it was wrong said Lionel Hezekiah bursting into
prompt tears II thought it would be bully fun Seemss if everything
whats fun s wrong

Salomes heart was not proof against tears as Lionel Hezekiah very well
knew She put her arm about the sobbing culprit and drew him to her
side

He didnt know it was wrong she said defiantly to Judith

Hes got to be taught then was Judiths retort No you neednt
try to beg him off Salome He shall go right to bed without supper and
stay there till tomorrow morning

Oh not without his supper entreated Salome Youyou wont improve
the childs morals by injuring his stomach Judith

Without his supper I say repeated Judith inexorably Lionel
Hezekiah go upstairs to the south room and go to bed at once

Lionel Hezekiah went upstairs and went to bed at once He was never
sulky or disobedient Salome listened to him as he stumped patiently
upstairs with a sob at every step and her own eyes filled with tears

Now dont for pitys sake go crying Salome said Judith irritably I
think Ive let him off very easily He is enough to try the patience of
a saint and I never was that she added with entire truth

But he isnt bad pleaded Salome You know he never does anything the
second time after he has been told it was wrong never

What good does that do when he is certain to do something new and twice
as bad I never saw anything like him for originating ideas of mischief
Just look at what he has done in the past fortnightin one fortnight
Salome He brought in a live snake and nearly frightened you into fits
he drank up a bottle of liniment and almost poisoned himself he took
three toads to bed with him he climbed into the henhouse loft and fell
through on a hen and killed her he painted his face all over with your
watercolours and now comes THIS exploit And eggs at twentyeight
cents a dozen I tell you Salome Lionel Hezekiah is an expensive
luxury

But we couldnt do without him protested Salome

_I_ could But as you cant or think you cant well have to keep
him I suppose But the only way to secure any peace of mind for
ourselves as far as I can see is to tether him in the yard and hire
somebody to watch him

There must be some way of managing him said Salome desperately She
thought Judith was in earnest about the tethering Judith was generally
so terribly in earnest in all she said Perhaps it is because he has
no other employment that he invents so many unheardof things If he had
anything to occupy himself withperhaps if we sent him to school

Hes too young to go to school Father always said that no child should
go to school until it was seven and I dont mean Lionel Hezekiah shall
Well Im going to take a pail of hot water and a brush and see what I
can do to that henhouse door Ive got my afternoons work cut out for
me

Judith stood Salomes crutch up beside her and departed to purify the
henhouse door As soon as she was safely out of the way Salome took her
crutch and limped slowly and painfully to the foot of the stairs She
could not go up and comfort Lionel Hezekiah as she yearned to do
which was the reason Judith had sent him upstairs Salome had not been
upstairs for fifteen years Neither did she dare to call him out on the
landing lest Judith return Besides of course he must be punished he
had been very naughty

But I wish I could smuggle a bit of supper up to him she mused
sitting down on the lowest step and listening I dont hear a sound I
suppose he has cried himself to sleep poor dear baby He certainly
is dreadfully mischievous but it seems to me that it shows an
investigating turn of mind and if it could only be directed into the
proper channelsI wish Judith would let me have a talk with Mr Leonard
about Lionel Hezekiah I wish Judith didnt hate ministers so I dont
mind so much her not letting me go to church because Im so lame that
it would be painful anyhow but Id like to talk with Mr Leonard now
and then about some things I can never believe that Judith and father
were right I am sure they were not There is a God and Im afraid
its terribly wicked not to go to church But there nothing short of a
miracle would convince Judith so there is no use in thinking about it
Yes Lionel Hezekiah must have gone to sleep

Salome pictured him so with his long curling lashes brushing his rosy
tearstained cheek and his chubby fists clasped tightly over his breast
as was his habit her heart grew warm and thrilling with the maternity
the picture provoked

A year previously Lionel Hezekiahs parents Abner and Martha Smith had
died leaving a houseful of children and very little else The children
were adopted into various Carmody families and Salome Marsh had amazed
Judith by asking to be allowed to take the fiveyearold baby At
first Judith had laughed at the idea but when she found that Salome
was in earnest she yielded Judith always gave Salome her own way
except on one point

If you want the child I suppose you must have him she said finally
I wish he had a civilized name though Hezekiah is bad and Lionel is
worse but the two in combination and tacked on to Smith at that is
something that only Martha Smith could have invented Her judgment was
the same clear through from selecting husbands to names

So Lionel Hezekiah came into Judiths home and Salomes heart The
latter was permitted to love him all she pleased but Judith overlooked
his training with a critical eye Possibly it was just as well for
Salome might otherwise have ruined him with indulgence Salome who
always adopted Judiths opinions no matter how ill they fitted her
deferred to the formers decrees meekly and suffered far more than
Lionel Hezekiah when he was punished

She sat on the stairs until she fell asleep herself her head pillowed
on her arm Judith found her there when she came in severe and
triumphant from her bout with the henhouse door Her face softened into
marvelous tenderness as she looked at Salome

Shes nothing but a child herself in spite of her age she thought
pityingly A child thats had her whole life thwarted and spoiled
through no fault of her own And yet folks say there is a God who is
kind and good If there is a God he is a cruel jealous tyrant and I
hate Him

Judiths eyes were bitter and vindictive She thought she had many
grievances against the great Power that rules the universe but the most
intense was Salomes helplessnessSalome who fifteen years before
had been the brightest happiest of maidens light of heart and foot
bubbling over with harmless sparkling mirth and life If Salome could
only walk like other women Judith told herself that she would not hate
the great tyrannical Power

Lionel Hezekiah was subdued and angelic for four days after that affair
of the henhouse door Then he broke out in a new place One afternoon he
came in sobbing with his golden curls full of burrs Judith was not in
but Salome dropped her crochetwork and gazed at him in dismay

Oh Lionel Hezekiah what have you gone and done now

II just stuck the burrs in cause I was playing I was a heathen
chief sobbed Lionel Hezekiah It was great fun while it lasted but
when I tried to take them out it hurt awful

Neither Salome nor Lionel Hezekiah ever forgot the harrowing hour that
followed With the aid of comb and scissors Salome eventually got the
burrs out of Lionel Hezekiahs crop of curls It would be impossible to
decide which of them suffered more in the process Salome cried as hard
as Lionel Hezekiah did and every snip of the scissors or tug at the
silken floss cut into her heart She was almost exhausted when the
performance was over but she took the tired Lionel Hezekiah on her
knee and laid her wet cheek against his shining head

Oh Lionel Hezekiah what does make you get into mischief so
constantly she sighed

Lionel Hezekiah frowned reflectively

I dont know he finally announced unless its because you dont
send me to Sunday school

Salome started as if an electric shock had passed through her frail
body

Why Lionel Hezekiah she stammered what put such and idea into your
head

Well all the other boys go said Lionel Hezekiah defiantly and
theyre all bettern me so I guess that must be the reason Teddy
Markham says that all little boys should go to Sunday school and that
if they dont theyre sure to go to the bad place I dont see how you
can spect me to behave well when you wont send me to Sunday school

Would you like to go asked Salome almost in a whisper

Id like it bully said Lionel Hezekiah frankly and succinctly

Oh dont use such dreadful words sighed Salome helplessly Ill see
what can be done Perhaps you can go Ill ask your Aunt Judith

Oh Aunt Judith wont let me go said Lionel Hezekiah despondingly
Aunt Judith doesnt believe there is any God or any bad place Teddy
Markham says she doesnt He says shes an awful wicked woman cause she
never goes to church So you must be wicked too Aunt Salome cause you
never go Why dont you

Youryour Aunt Judith wont let me go faltered Salome more
perplexed than she had ever been before in her life

Well it doesnt seem to me that you have much fun on Sundays
remarked Lionel Hezekiah ponderingly Id have more if I was you But I
spose you cant cause youre ladies Im glad Im a man Look at Abel
Blair what splendid times he has on Sundays He never goes to church
but he goes fishing and has cockfights and gets drunk When I grow
up Im going to do that on Sundays too since I wont be going to
church I dont want to go to church but Id like to go to Sunday
school

Salome listened in agony Every word of Lionel Hezekiahs stung her
conscience unbearably So this was the result of her weak yielding to
Judith this innocent child looked upon her as a wicked woman and
worse still regarded old depraved Abel Blair as a model to be
imitated Oh was it too late to undo the evil When Judith returned
Salome blurted out the whole story Lionel Hezekiah must go to Sunday
school she concluded appealingly

Judiths face hardened until it was as if cut in stone

No he shall not she said stubbornly No one living in my household
shall ever go to church or Sunday school I gave in to you when you
wanted to teach him to say his prayers though I knew it was only
foolish superstition but I shant yield another inch You know exactly
how I feel on this subject Salome I believe just as father did You
know he hated churches and churchgoing And was there ever a better
kinder more lovable man

Mother believed in God mother always went to church pleaded Salome

Mother was weak and superstitious just as you are retorted Judith
inflexibly I tell you Salome I dont believe there is a God But if
there is He is cruel and unjust and I hate Him

Judith gasped Salome aghast at the impiety She half expected to see
her sister struck dead at her feet

Dont Judith me said Judith passionately in the strange anger that
any discussion of the subject always roused in her I mean every word I
say Before you got lame I didnt feel much about it one way or another
Id just as soon have gone with mother as with father But when you
were struck down like that I knew father was right

For a moment Salome quailed She felt that she could not dare not
stand out against Judith For her own sake she could not have done so
but the thought of Lionel Hezekiah nerved her to desperation She struck
her thin bleached little hands wildly together

Judith Im going to church tomorrow she cried I tell you I am
I wont set Lionel Hezekiah a bad example one day longer Ill not take
him I wont go against you in that for it is your bounty feeds and
clothes him but Im going myself

If you do Salome Marsh Ill never forgive you said Judith her
harsh face dark with anger and then not trusting herself to discuss
the subject any longer she went out

Salome dissolved into her ready tears and cried most of the night
But her resolution did not fail Go to church she would for that dear
babys sake

Judith would not speak to her at breakfast and this almost broke
Salomes heart but she dared not yield After breakfast she limped
painfully into her room and still more painfully dressed herself When
she was ready she took a little old worn Bible out of her box It had
been her mothers and Salome read a chapter in it every night although
she never dared to let Judith see her doing it

When she limped out into the kitchen Judith looked up with a hard face
A flame of sullen anger glowed in her dark eyes and she went into the
sittingroom and shut the door as if by that act she were shutting her
sister for evermore out of her heart and life Salome strung up to the
last pitch of nervous tension felt intuitively the significance of
that closed door For a moment she waveredoh she could not go against
Judith She was all but turning back to her room when Lionel Hezekiah
came running in and paused to look at her admiringly

You look just bully Aunt Salome he said Where are you going

Dont use that word Lionel Hezekiah pleaded Salome Im going to
church

Take me with you said Lionel Hezekiah promptly Salome shook her
head

I cant dear Your Aunt Judith wouldnt like it Perhaps she will let
you go after a while Now do be a good boy while I am away wont
you Dont do any naughty things I wont do them if I know theyre
naughty conceded Lionel Hezekiah But thats just the trouble I
dont know whats naughty and what aint Probly if I went to Sunday
school Id find out

Salome limped out of the yard and down the lane bordered by its asters
and goldenrod Fortunately the church was just outside the lane
across the main road but Salome found it hard to cover even that short
distance She felt almost exhausted when she reached the church and
toiled painfully up the aisle to her mothers old pew She laid her
crutch on the seat and sank into the corner by the window with a sigh
of relief

She had elected to come early so that she might get there before the
rest of the people The church was as yet empty save for a class of
Sunday school children and their teacher in a remote corner who paused
midway in their lesson to stare with amazement at the astonishing sight
of Salome Marsh limping into church

The big building shadowy from the great elms around it was very still
A faint murmur came from the closed room behind the pulpit where the
rest of the Sunday school was assembled In front of the pulpit was a
stand bearing tall white geraniums in luxuriant blossom The light
fell through the stainedglass window in a soft tangle of hues upon the
floor Salome felt a sense of peace and happiness fill her heart Even
Judiths anger lost its importance She leaned her head against
the windowsill and gave herself up to the flood of tender old
recollections that swept over her

Memory went back to the years of her childhood when she had sat in this
pew every Sunday with her mother Judith had come then too always
seeming grown up to Salome by reason of her ten years seniority Her
tall dark reserved father never came Salome knew that the Carmody
people called him an infidel and looked upon him as a very wicked man
But he had not been wicked he had been good and kind in his own odd
way

The gentle little mother had died when Salome was ten years old but so
loving and tender was Judiths care that the child did not miss anything
out of her life Judith Marsh loved her little sister with an intensity
that was maternal She herself was a plain repellent girl liked by
few sought after by no man but she was determined that Salome should
have everything that she had missedadmiration friendship love She
would have a vicarious youth in Salomes

All went according to Judiths planning until Salome was eighteen
and then trouble after trouble came Their father whom Judith had
understood and passionately loved died Salomes young lover was killed
in a railroad accident and finally Salome herself developed symptoms of
the hipdisease which springing from a trifling injury eventually left
her a cripple Everything possible was done for her Judith falling
heir to a snug little fortune by the death of the old aunt for whom she
was named spared nothing to obtain the best medical skill and in vain
One and all the great doctors failed

Judith had borne her fathers death bravely enough in spite of her agony
of grief she had watched her sister pining and fading with the pain of
her broken heart without growing bitter but when she knew at last that
Salome would never walk again save as she hobbled painfully about on
her crutch the smouldering revolt in her soul broke its bounds and
overflowed her nature in a passionate rebellion against the Being who
had sent or had failed to prevent these calamities She did not rave
or denounce wildly that was not Judiths way but she never went to
church again and it soon became an accepted fact in Carmody that Judith
Marsh was as rank an infidel as her father had been before her nay
worse since she would not even allow Salome to go to church and shut
the door in the ministers face when he went to see her

I should have stood out against her for conscience sake reflected
Salome in her pew selfreproachfully But O dear Im afraid shell
never forgive me and how can I live if she doesnt But I must endure
it for Lionel Hezekiahs sake my weakness has perhaps done him great
harm already They say that what a child learns in the first seven years
never leaves him so Lionel Hezekiah has only another year to get set
right about these things Oh if Ive left it till too late

When the people began to come in Salome felt painfully the curious
glances directed at her Look where she would she met them unless
she looked out of the window so out of the window she did look
unswervingly her delicate little face burning crimson with
selfconsciousness She could see her home and its back yard plainly
with Lionel Hezekiah making mudpies joyfully in the corner Presently
she saw Judith come out of the house and stride away to the pine wood
behind it Judith always betook herself to the pines in time of mental
stress and strain

Salome could see the sunlight shining on Lionel Hezekiahs bare head as
he mixed his pies In the pleasure of watching him she forgot where she
was and the curious eyes turned on her

Suddenly Lionel Hezekiah ceased concocting pies and betook himself to
the corner of the summer kitchen where he proceeded to climb up to the
top of the stormfence and from there to mount the sloping kitchen roof
Salome clasped her hands in agony What if the child should fall Oh
why had Judith gone away and left him alone What ifwhat ifand then
while her brain with lightninglike rapidity pictured forth a dozen
possible catastrophes something really did happen Lionel Hezekiah
slipped sprawled wildly slid down and fell off the roof in a
bewildering whirl of arms and legs plump into the big rainwater
hogshead under the spout which was generally full to the brim with
rainwater a hogshead big and deep enough to swallow up half a dozen
small boys who went climbing kitchen roofs on a Sunday

Then something took place that is talked of in Carmody to this day and
even fiercely wrangled over so many and conflicting are the opinions on
the subject Salome Marsh who had not walked a step without assistance
for fifteen years suddenly sprang to her feet with a shriek ran down
the aisle and out of the door

Every man woman and child in the Carmody church followed her even to
the minister who had just announced his text When they got out Salome
was already halfway up her lane running wildly In her heart was room
for but one agonized thought Would Lionel Hezekiah be drowned before
she reached him

She opened the gate of the yard and panted across it just as a tall
grimfaced woman came around the corner of the house and stood rooted to
the ground in astonishment at the sight that met her eyes

But Salome saw nobody She flung herself against the hogshead and looked
in sick with terror at what she might see What she did see was Lionel
Hezekiah sitting on the bottom of the hogshead in water that came
only to his waist He was looking rather dazed and bewildered but was
apparently quite uninjured

The yard was full of people but nobody had as yet said a word awe and
wonder held everybody in spellbound silence Judith was the first to
speak She pushed through the crowd to Salome Her face was blanched
to a deadly whiteness and her eyes as Mrs William Blair afterwards
declared were enough to give a body the creeps

Salome she said in a high shrill unnatural voice where is your
crutch

Salome came to herself at the question For the first time she realized
that she had walked nay run all that distance from the church alone
and unaided She turned pale swayed and would have fallen if Judith
had not caught her

Old Dr Blair came forward briskly

Carry her in he said and dont all of you come crowding in either
She wants quiet and rest for a spell

Most of the people obediently returned to the church their sudden
loosened tongues clattering in voluble excitement A few women assisted
Judith to carry Salome in and lay her on the kitchen lounge followed
by the doctor and the dripping Lionel Hezekiah whom the minister had
lifted out of the hogshead and to whom nobody now paid the slightest
attention

Salome faltered out her story and her hearers listened with varying
emotions

Its a miracle said Sam Lawson in an awed voice

Dr Blair shrugged his shoulders There is no miracle about it he
said bluntly Its all perfectly natural The disease in the hip has
evidently been quite well for a long time Nature does sometimes work
cures like that when she is let alone The trouble was that the muscles
were paralyzed by long disuse That paralysis was overcome by the force
of a strong and instinctive effort Salome get up and walk across the
kitchen

Salome obeyed She walked across the kitchen and back slowly stiffly
falteringly now that the stimulus of frantic fear was spent but still
she walked The doctor nodded his satisfaction

Keep that up every day Walk as much as you can without tiring
yourself and youll soon be as spry as ever No more need of crutches
for you but theres no miracle in the case

Judith Marsh turned to him She had not spoken a word since her question
concerning Salomes crutch Now she said passionately

It WAS a miracle God has worked it to prove His existence for me and
I accept the proof

The old doctor shrugged his shoulders again Being a wise man he knew
when to hold his tongue

Well put Salome to bed and let her sleep the rest of the day Shes
worn out And for pitys sake let some one take that poor child and put
some dry clothes on him before he catches his death of cold

That evening as Salome Marsh lay in her bed in a glory of sunset light
her heart filled with unutterable gratitude and happiness Judith came
into the room She wore her best hat and dress and she held Lionel
Hezekiah by the hand Lionel Hezekiahs beaming face was scrubbed clean
and his curls fell in beautiful sleekness over the lace collar of his
velvet suit

How do you feel now Salome asked Judith gently

Better Ive had a lovely sleep But where are you going Judith

I am going to church said Judith firmly and I am going to take
Lionel Hezekiah with me





XII The End of a Quarrel


Nancy Rogerson sat down on Louisa Shaws front doorstep and looked about
her drawing a long breath of delight that seemed tinged with pain
Everything was very much the same the square garden was a charming
hodgepodge of fruit and flowers and gooseberry bushes and tiger
lilies a gnarled old apple tree sticking up here and there and a thick
cherry copse at the foot Behind was a row of pointed firs coming out
darkly against the swimming pink sunset sky not looking a day older
than they had looked twenty years ago when Nancy had been a young girl
walking and dreaming in their shadows The old willow to the left was as
big and sweeping and Nancy thought with a little shudder probably as
caterpillary as ever Nancy had learned many things in her twenty years
of exile from Avonlea but she had never learned to conquer her dread of
caterpillars

Nothing is much changed Louisa she said propping her chin on her
plump white hands and sniffing at the delectable odour of the bruised
mint upon which Louisa was trampling Im glad I was afraid to come
back for fear you would have improved the old garden out of existence
or else into some prim orderly lawn which would have been worse Its
as magnificently untidy as ever and the fence still wobbles It CANT
be the same fence but it looks exactly like it No nothing is much
changed Thank you Louisa

Louisa had not the faintest idea what Nancy was thanking her for but
then she had never been able to fathom Nancy much as she had always
liked her in the old girlhood days that now seemed much further away
to Louisa than they did to Nancy Louisa was separated from them by the
fulness of wifehood and motherhood while Nancy looked back only over
the narrow gap that empty years make

You havent changed much yourself Nancy she said looking admiringly
at Nancys trim figure in the nurses uniform she had donned to show
Louisa what it was like her firm pinkandwhite face and the the
glossy waves of her golden brown hair Youve held your own wonderfully
well

Havent I said Nancy complacently Modern methods of massage and
cold cream have kept away the crowsfeet and fortunately I had the
Rogerson complexion to start with You wouldnt think I was really
thirtyeight would you Thirtyeight Twenty years ago I thought
anybody who was thirtyeight was a perfect female Methuselah And now I
feel so horribly ridiculously young Louisa Every morning when I get
up I have to say solemnly to myself three times Youre an old maid
Nancy Rogerson to tone myself down to anything like a becoming
attitude for the day

I guess you dont mind being an old maid much said Louisa shrugging
her shoulders She would not have been an old maid herself for anything
yet she inconsistently envied Nancy her freedom her wide life in the
world her unlined brow and carefree lightness of spirit

Oh but I do mind said Nancy frankly I hate being an old maid

Why dont you get married then asked Louisa paying an unconscious
tribute to Nancys perennial chance by her use of the present tense

Nancy shook her head

No that wouldnt suit me either I dont want to be married Do you
remember that story Anne Shirley used to tell long ago of the pupil who
wanted to be a widow because if you were married your husband bossed
you and if you werent married people called you an old maid Well
that is precisely my opinion Id like to be a widow Then Id have the
freedom of the unmarried with the kudos of the married I could eat my
cake and have it too Oh to be a widow

Nancy said Louisa in a shocked tone

Nancy laughed a mellow gurgle that rippled through the garden like a
brook

Oh Louisa I can shock you yet That was just how you used to say
Nancy long ago as if Id broken all the commandments at once

You do say such queer things protested Louisa and half the time I
dont know what you mean

Bless you dear coz half the time I dont myself Perhaps the joy of
coming back to the old spot has slightly turned my brain Ive found my
lost girlhood here Im NOT thirtyeight in this gardenit is a flat
impossibility Im sweet eighteen with a waist line two inches smaller
Look the sun is just setting I see he has still his old trick of
throwing his last beams over the Wright farmhouse By the way Louisa
is Peter Wright still living there

Yes Louisa threw a sudden interested glance at the apparently placid
Nancy

Married I suppose with half a dozen children said Nancy
indifferently pulling up some more sprigs of mint and pinning them on
her breast Perhaps the exertion of leaning over to do it flushed her
face There was more than the Rogerson colour in it anyhow and Louisa
slow though her mental processes might be in some respects thought
she understood the meaning of a blush as well as the next one All the
instinct of the matchmaker flamed up in her

Indeed he isnt she said promptly Peter Wright has never married
He has been faithful to your memory Nancy

Ugh You make me feel as if I were buried up there in the Avonlea
cemetery and had a monument over me with a weeping willow carved on
it shivered Nancy When it is said that a man has been faithful to
a womans memory it generally means that he couldnt get anyone else to
take him

That isnt the case with Peter protested Louisa He is a good match
and many a woman would have been glad to take him and would yet Hes
only fortythree But hes never taken the slightest interest in anyone
since you threw him over Nancy

But I didnt He threw me over said Nancy plaintively looking afar
over the lowlying fields and a feathery young spruce valley to the
white buildings of the Wright farm glowing rosily in the sunset light
when all the rest of Avonlea was scarfing itself in shadows There was
laughter in her eyes Louisa could not pierce beneath that laughter to
find if there were anything under it

Fudge said Louisa What on earth did you and Peter quarrel about
she added curiously

Ive often wondered parried Nancy

And youve never seen him since reflected Louisa

No Has he changed much

Well some He is gray and kind of tiredlooking But it isnt to be
wondered atliving the life he does He hasnt had a housekeeper for
two yearsnot since his old aunt died He just lives there alone and
cooks his own meals Ive never been in the house but folks say the
disorder is something awful

Yes I shouldnt think Peter was cut out for a tidy housekeeper said
Nancy lightly dragging up more mint Just think Louisa if it hadnt
been for that old quarrel I might be Mrs Peter Wright at this very
moment mother to the aforesaid supposed half dozen and vexing my soul
over Peters meals and socks and cows

I guess you are better off as you are said Louisa

Oh I dont know Nancy looked up at the white house on the hill
again I have an awfully good time out of life but it doesnt seem to
satisfy somehow To be candidand oh Louisa candour is a rare thing
among women when it comes to talking of the menI believe Id rather
be cooking Peters meals and dusting his house I wouldnt mind his bad
grammar now Ive learned one or two valuable little things out yonder
and one is that it doesnt matter if a mans grammar is askew so long
as he doesnt swear at you By the way is Peter as ungrammatical as
ever

II dont know said Louisa helplessly I never knew he WAS
ungrammatical

Does he still say I seen and them things demanded Nancy

I never noticed confessed Louisa

Enviable Louisa Would that I had been born with that blessed faculty
of never noticing It stands a woman in better stead than beauty or
brains _I_ used to notice Peters mistakes When he said I seen it
jarred on me in my salad days I tried oh so tactfully to reform him
in that respect Peter didnt like being reformedthe Wrights always
had a fairly good opinion of themselves you know It was really over a
question of syntax we quarrelled Peter told me Id have to take him as
he was grammar and all or go without him I went without himand ever
since Ive been wondering if I were really sorry or if it were merely a
pleasantly sentimental regret I was hugging to my heart I daresay its
the latter Now Louisa I see the beginning of the plot far down in
those placid eyes of yours Strangle it at birth dear Louisa There is
no use in your trying to make up a match between Peter and me nowno
nor in slyly inviting him up here to tea some evening as you are even
this moment thinking of doing

Well I must go and milk the cows gasped Louisa rather glad to make
her escape Nancys power of thoughtreading struck her as uncanny She
felt afraid to remain with her cousin any longer lest Nancy should drag
to light all the secrets of her being

Nancy sat long on the steps after Louisa had gonesat until the night
came down darkly and sweetly over the garden and the stars twinkled
out above the firs This had been her home in girlhood Here she had
lived and kept house for her father When he died Curtis Shaw newly
married to her cousin Louisa bought the farm from her and moved in
Nancy stayed on with them expecting soon to go to a home of her own
She and Peter Wright were engaged

Then came their mysterious quarrel concerning the cause of which kith
and kin on both sides were left in annoying ignorance Of the results
they were not ignorant Nancy promptly packed up and left Avonlea seven
hundred miles behind her She went to a hospital in Montreal and studied
nursing In the twenty years that followed she had never even revisited
Avonlea Her sudden descent on it this summer was a whim born of a
moments homesick longing for this same old garden She had not thought
about Peter In very truth she had thought little about Peter for the
last fifteen years She supposed that she had forgotten him But now
sitting on the old doorstep where she had often sat in her courting
days with Peter lounging on a broad stone at her feet something tugged
at her heartstrings She looked over the valley to the light in the
kitchen of the Wright farmhouse and pictured Peter sitting there
lonely and uncared for with naught but the cold comfort of his own
providing

Well he should have got married she said snappishly I am not going
to worry because he is a lonely old bachelor when all these years I have
supposed him a comfy Benedict Why doesnt he hire him a housekeeper
at least He can afford it the place looks prosperous Ugh Ive a fat
bank account and Ive seen almost everything in the world worth
seeing but Ive got several carefully hidden gray hairs and a horrible
conviction that grammar isnt one of the essential things in life after
all Well Im not going to moon out here in the dew any longer Im
going in to read the smartest frilliest frothiest society novel in my
trunk

In the week that followed Nancy enjoyed herself after her own fashion
She read and swung in the garden having a hammock hung under the firs
She went far afield in rambles to woods and lonely uplands

I like it much better than meeting people she said when Louisa
suggested going to see this one and that one especially the Avonlea
people All my old chums are gone or hopelessly married and changed
and the young set who have come up know not Joseph and make me feel
uncomfortably middleaged Its far worse to feel middleaged than old
you know Away there in the woods I feel as eternally young as Nature
herself And oh its so nice not having to fuss with thermometers and
temperatures and other peoples whims Let me indulge my own whims
Louisa dear and punish me with a cold bite when I come in late for
meals Im not even going to church again It was horrible there
yesterday The church is so offensively spickandspan brand new and
modern

Its thought to be the prettiest church in these parts protested
Louisa a little sorely

Churches shouldnt be prettythey should at least be fifty years old
and mellowed into beauty New churches are an abomination

Did you see Peter Wright in church asked Louisa She had been
bursting to ask it

Nancy nodded

Verily yes He sat right across from me in the corner pew I didnt
think him painfully changed Irongray hair becomes him But I was
horribly disappointed in myself I had expected to feel at least a
romantic thrill but all I felt was a comfortable interest such as I
might have taken in any old friend Do my utmost Louisa I couldnt
compass a thrill

Did he come to speak to you asked Louisa who hadnt any idea what
Nancy meant by her thrills

Alas no It wasnt my fault I stood at the door outside with the
most amiable expression I could assume but Peter merely sauntered away
without a glance in my direction It would be some comfort to my vanity
if I could believe it was on account of rankling spite or pride But the
honest truth dear Weezy is that it looked to me exactly as if he never
thought of it He was more interested in talking about the hay crop with
Oliver Sloanewho by the way is more Oliver Sloaneish than ever

If you feel as you said you did the other night why didnt you go and
speak to him Louisa wanted to know

But I dont feel that way now That was just a mood You dont know
anything about moods dearie You dont know what it is to yearn
desperately one hour for something you wouldnt take if it were offered
you the next

But that is foolishness protested Louisa

To be sure it isrank foolishness But oh it is so delightful to
be foolish after being compelled to be unbrokenly sensible for twenty
years Well Im going picking strawberries this afternoon Lou Dont
wait tea for me I probably wont be back till dark Ive only four more
days to stay and I want to make the most of them

Nancy wandered far and wide in her rambles that afternoon When she had
filled her jug she still roamed about with delicious aimlessness Once
she found herself in a wood lane skirting a field wherein a man was
mowing hay The man was Peter Wright Nancy walked faster when she
discovered this with never a roving glance and presently the green
ferny depths of the maple woods swallowed her up

From old recollections she knew that she was on Peter Morrisons land
and calculated that if she kept straight on she would come out where the
old Morrison house used to be Her calculations proved correct with a
trifling variation She came out fifty yards south of the old deserted
Morrison house and found herself in the yard of the Wright farm

Passing the housethe house where she had once dreamed of reigning as
mistressNancys curiosity overcame her The place was not in view of
any other near house She deliberately went up to it intendinglow be
it spokento peep in at the kitchen window But seeing the door wide
open she went to it instead and halted on the step looking about her
keenly

The kitchen was certainly pitiful in its disorder The floor had
apparently not been swept for a fortnight On the bare deal table were
the remnants of Peters dinner a meal that could not have been very
tempting at its best

What a miserable place for a human being to live in groaned Nancy
Look at the ashes on that stove And that table Is it any wonder that
Peter has got gray Hell work hard haymaking all the afternoonand
then come home to THIS

An idea suddenly darted into Nancys brain At first she looked aghast
Then she laughed and glanced at her watch

Ill do itjust for fun and a little pity Its halfpast two and
Peter wont be home till four at the earliest Ill have a good hour to
do it in and still make my escape in good time Nobody will ever know
nobody can see me here

Nancy went in threw off her hat and seized a broom The first thing
she did was to give the kitchen a thorough sweeping Then she kindled
a fire put a kettle full of water on to heat and attacked the dishes
From the number of them she rightly concluded that Peter hadnt washed
any for at least a week

I suppose he just uses the clean ones as long as they hold out and
then has a grand washup she laughed I wonder where he keeps his
dishtowels if he has any

Evidently Peter hadnt any At least Nancy couldnt find any She
marched boldly into the dusty sittingroom and explored the drawers of
an oldfashioned sideboard confiscating a towel she found there As she
worked she hummed a song her steps were light and her eyes bright with
excitement Nancy was enjoying herself thoroughly there was no doubt of
that The spice of mischief in the adventure pleased her mightily

The dishes washed she hunted up a clean but yellow and evidently long
unused tablecloth out of the sideboard and proceeded to set the table
and get Peters tea She found bread and butter in the pantry a trip to
the cellar furnished a pitcher of cream and Nancy recklessly heaped the
contents of her strawberry jug on Peters plate The tea was made and
set back to keep warm And as a finishing touch Nancy ravaged the old
neglected garden and set a huge bowl of crimson roses in the centre of
the table

Now I must go she said aloud Wouldnt it be fun to see Peters
face when he comes in though Hahum Ive enjoyed doing thisbut why
Nancy Rogerson dont be asking yourself conundrums Put on your hat and
proceed homeward constructing on your way some reliable fib to account
to Louisa for the absence of your strawberries

Nancy paused a moment and looked around wistfully She had made the
place look cheery and neat and homelike She felt that queer tugging at
her heartstrings again Suppose she belonged here and was waiting for
Peter to come home to tea SupposeNancy whirled around with a sudden
horrible prescience of what she was going to see Peter Wright was
standing in the doorway

Nancys face went crimson For the first time in her life she had not a
word to say for herself Peter looked at her and then at the table with
its fruit and flowers

Thank you he said politely

Nancy recovered herself With a shamefaced laugh she held out her
hand

Dont have me arrested for trespass Peter I came and looked in at
your kitchen out of impertinent curiosity and just for fun I thought
Id come in and get your tea I thought youd be so surprisedand I
meant to go before you came home of course

I wouldnt have been surprised said Peter shaking hands I saw you
go past the field and I tied the horses and followed you down through
the woods Ive been sitting on the fence back yonder watching your
comings and goings Why didnt you come and speak to me at church
yesterday Peter demanded Nancy boldly

I was afraid I would say something ungrammatical answered Peter
drily

The crimson flamed over Nancys face again She pulled her hand away

Thats cruel of you Peter

Peter suddenly laughed There was a note of boyishness in the laughter

So it is he said but I had to get rid of the accumulated malice and
spite of twenty years somehow Its all gone now and Ill be as amiable
as I know how But since you have gone to the trouble of getting
my supper for me Nancy you must stay and help me eat it Them
strawberries look good I havent had any this summerbeen too busy to
pick them

Nancy stayed She sat at the head of Peters table and poured his tea
for him She talked to him wittily of the Avonlea people and the changes
in their old set Peter followed her lead with an apparent absence of
selfconsciousness eating his supper like a man whose heart and mind
were alike on good terms with him Nancy felt wretchedand at the
same time ridiculously happy It seemed the most grotesque thing in the
world that she should be presiding there at Peters table and yet
the most natural There were moments when she felt like cryingother
moments when her laughter was as ready and spontaneous as a girls
Sentiment and humour had always waged an equal contest in Nancys
nature

When Peter had finished his strawberries he folded his arms on the table
and looked admiringly at Nancy

You look well at the head of a table Nancy he said critically How
is it that you havent been presiding at one of your own long before
this I thought youd meet a lots of men out in the world that youd
likemen who talked good grammar

Peter dont said Nancy wincing I was a goose

No you were quite right I was a tetchy fool If Id had any sense
Id have felt thankful you thought enough of me to want to improve me
and Id have tried to kerrect my mistakes instead of getting mad Its
too late now I suppose

Too late for what said Nancy plucking up heart of grace at something
in Peters tone and look

Forkerrecting mistakes

Grammatical ones

Not exactly I guess them mistakes are past kerrecting in an old fellow
like me Worse mistakes Nancy I wonder what you would say if I asked
you to forgive me and have me after all

Id snap you up before youd have time to change your mind said Nancy
brazenly She tried to look Peter in the face but her blue eyes where
tears and mirth were blending faltered down before his gray ones

Peter stood up knocking over his chair and strode around the table to
her

Nancy my girl he said
