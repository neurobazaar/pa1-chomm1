FOR THE TERM OF HIS NATURAL LIFE

By Marcus Clarke



DEDICATION TO SIR CHARLES GAVAN DUFFY

My Dear Sir Charles I take leave to dedicate this work to you not
merely because your nineteen years of political and literary life in
Australia render it very fitting that any work written by a resident in
the colonies and having to do with the history of past colonial
days should bear your name upon its dedicatory page but because the
publication of my book is due to your advice and encouragement

The convict of fiction has been hitherto shown only at the beginning or
at the end of his career Either his exile has been the mysterious end
to his misdeeds or he has appeared upon the scene to claim interest by
reason of an equally unintelligible love of crime acquired during his
experience in a penal settlement Charles Reade has drawn the interior
of a house of correction in England and Victor Hugo has shown how
a French convict fares after the fulfilment of his sentence But
no writerso far as I am awarehas attempted to depict the dismal
condition of a felon during his term of transportation

I have endeavoured in His Natural Life to set forth the working and
the results of an English system of transportation carefully considered
and carried out under official supervision and to illustrate in the
manner best calculated as I think to attract general attention the
inexpediency of again allowing offenders against the law to be herded
together in places remote from the wholesome influence of public
opinion and to be submitted to a discipline which must necessarily
depend for its just administration upon the personal character and
temper of their gaolers

Your critical faculty will doubtless find in the construction and
artistic working of this book many faults I do not think however
that you will discover any exaggerations Some of the events narrated
are doubtless tragic and terrible but I hold it needful to my purpose
to record them for they are events which have actually occurred and
which if the blunders which produced them be repeated must infallibly
occur again It is true that the British Government have ceased to
deport the criminals of England but the method of punishment of which
that deportation was a part is still in existence Port Blair is a Port
Arthur filled with Indianmen instead of Englishmen and within the
last year France has established at New Caledonia a penal settlement
which will in the natural course of things repeat in its annals the
history of Macquarie Harbour and of Norfolk Island

With this brief preface I beg you to accept this work I would that its
merits were equal either to your kindness or to my regard

I am

My dear Sir Charles

Faithfully yours

HIS NATURAL LIFE




PROLOGUE

On the evening of May 3 1827 the garden of a large redbrick
bowwindowed mansion called North End House which enclosed in spacious
grounds stands on the eastern height of Hampstead Heath between
Finchley Road and the Chestnut Avenue was the scene of a domestic
tragedy

Three persons were the actors in it One was an old man whose white
hair and wrinkled face gave token that he was at least sixty years
of age He stood erect with his back to the wall which separates the
garden from the Heath in the attitude of one surprised into sudden
passion and held uplifted the heavy ebony cane upon which he
was ordinarily accustomed to lean He was confronted by a man of
twoandtwenty unusually tall and athletic of figure dresses in rough
seafaring clothes and who held in his arms protecting her a lady
of middle age The face of the young man wore an expression of
horrorstricken astonishment and the slight frame of the greyhaired
woman was convulsed with sobs

These three people were Sir Richard Devine his wife and his only son
Richard who had returned from abroad that morning

So madam said Sir Richard in the highstrung accents which in
crises of great mental agony are common to the most selfrestrained of
us you have been for twenty years a living lie For twenty years
you have cheated and mocked me For twenty yearsin company with
a scoundrel whose name is a byword for all that is profligate and
baseyou have laughed at me for a credulous and hoodwinked fool and
now because I dared to raise my hand to that reckless boy you confess
your shame and glory in the confession

Mother dear mother cried the young man in a paroxysm of grief say
that you did not mean those words you said them but in anger See I am
calm now and he may strike me if he will

Lady Devine shuddered creeping close as though to hide herself in the
broad bosom of her son

The old man continued I married you Ellinor Wade for your beauty
you married me for my fortune I was a plebeian a ships carpenter you
were well born your father was a man of fashion a gambler the friend
of rakes and prodigals I was rich I had been knighted I was in favour
at Court He wanted money and he sold you I paid the price he asked
but there was nothing of your cousin my Lord Bellasis and Wotton in
the bond

Spare me sir spare me said Lady Ellinor faintly

Spare you Ay you have spared me have you not Look ye he cried
in sudden fury I am not to be fooled so easily Your family are proud
Colonel Wade has other daughters Your lover my Lord Bellasis even
now thinks to retrieve his broken fortunes by marriage You have
confessed your shame Tomorrow your father your sisters all the
world shall know the story you have told me

By Heaven sir you will not do this burst out the young man

Silence bastard cried Sir Richard Ay bite your lips the word is
of your precious mothers making

Lady Devine slipped through her sons arms and fell on her knees at her
husbands feet

Do not do this Richard I have been faithful to you for twoandtwenty
years I have borne all the slights and insults you have heaped upon me
The shameful secret of my early love broke from me when in your rage
you threatened him Let me go away kill me but do not shame me

Sir Richard who had turned to walk away stopped suddenly and his
great white eyebrows came together in his red face with a savage scowl
He laughed and in that laugh his fury seemed to congeal into a cold and
cruel hate

You would preserve your good name then You would conceal this disgrace
from the world You shall have your wishupon one condition

What is it sir she asked rising but trembling with terror as she
stood with drooping arms and widely opened eyes

The old man looked at her for an instant and then said slowly That
this impostor who so long has falsely borne my name has wrongfully
squandered my money and unlawfully eaten my bread shall pack That he
abandon for ever the name he has usurped keep himself from my sight
and never set foot again in house of mine

You would not part me from my only son cried the wretched woman

Take him with you to his father then

Richard Devine gently loosed the arms that again clung around his neck
kissed the pale face and turned his ownscarcely less paletowards
the old man

I owe you no duty he said You have always hated and reviled me
When by your violence you drove me from your house you set spies to
watch me in the life I had chosen I have nothing in common with you
I have long felt it Now when I learn for the first time whose son I
really am I rejoice to think that I have less to thank you for than
I once believed I accept the terms you offer I will go Nay mother
think of your good name

Sir Richard Devine laughed again I am glad to see you are so well
disposed Listen now Tonight I send for Quaid to alter my will My
sisters son Maurice Frere shall be my heir in your stead I give
you nothing You leave this house in an hour You change your name you
never by word or deed make claim on me or mine No matter what strait
or poverty you pleadif even your life should hang upon the issuethe
instant I hear that there exists on earth one who calls himself Richard
Devine that instant shall your mothers shame become a public scandal
You know me I keep my word I return in an hour madam let me find him
gone

He passed them upright as if upborne by passion strode down the
garden with the vigour that anger lends and took the road to London

Richard cried the poor mother Forgive me my son I have ruined
you

Richard Devine tossed his black hair from his brow in sudden passion of
love and grief

Mother dear mother do not weep he said I am not worthy of your
tears Forgive It is Iimpetuous and ungrateful during all your years
of sorrowwho most need forgiveness Let me share your burden that
I may lighten it He is just It is fitting that I go I can earn a
namea name that I need not blush to bear nor you to hear I am strong
I can work The world is wide Farewell my own mother

Not yet not yet Ah see he has taken the Belsize Road Oh Richard
pray Heaven they may not meet

Tush They will not meet You are pale you faint

A terror of I know not what coming evil overpowers me I tremble for
the future Oh Richard Richard Forgive me Pray for me

Hush dearest Come let me lead you in I will write I will send you
news of me once at least ere I depart Soyou are calmer mother

     

Sir Richard Devine knight shipbuilder naval contractor and
millionaire was the son of a Harwich boat carpenter Early left an
orphan with a sister to support he soon reduced his sole aim in life to
the accumulation of money In the Harwich boatshed nearly fifty years
before he had contractedin defiance of prophesied failureto build
the Hastings sloop of war for His Majesty King George the Thirds Lords
of the Admiralty This contract was the thin end of that wedge which
eventually split the mighty oak block of Government patronage into
threedeckers and ships of the line which did good service under
Pellew Parker Nelson Hood which exfoliated and ramified into huge
dockyards at Plymouth Portsmouth and Sheerness and bore as its buds
and flowers countless barrels of measly pork and maggoty biscuit The
sole aim of the coarse pushing and hardheaded son of Dick Devine was
to make money He had cringed and crawled and fluttered and blustered
had licked the dust off great mens shoes and danced attendance in
great mens antechambers Nothing was too low nothing too high for
him A shrewd man of business a thorough master of his trade troubled
with no scruples of honour or of delicacy he made money rapidly and
saved it when made The first hint that the public received of his
wealth was in 1796 when Mr Devine one of the shipwrights to the
Government and a comparatively young man of fortyfour or thereabouts
subscribed five thousand pounds to the Loyalty Loan raised to prosecute
the French war In 1805 after doing good and it was hinted not
unprofitable service in the trial of Lord Melville the Treasurer
of the Navy he married his sister to a wealthy Bristol merchant one
Anthony Frere and married himself to Ellinor Wade the eldest daughter
of Colonel Wotton Wade a boon companion of the Regent and uncle by
marriage of a remarkable scamp and dandy Lord Bellasis At that time
what with lucky speculations in the Fundsassisted it was whispered
by secret intelligence from France during the stormy years of 13 14
and 15and the legitimate profit on his Government contracts he had
accumulated a princely fortune and could afford to live in princely
magnificence But the oldmanofthesea burden of parsimony and avarice
which he had voluntarily taken upon him was not to be shaken off
and the only show he made of his wealth was by purchasing on his
knighthood the rambling but comfortable house at Hampstead and
ostensibly retiring from active business

His retirement was not a happy one He was a stern father and a severe
master His servants hated and his wife feared him His only son
Richard appeared to inherit his fathers strong will and imperious
manner Under careful supervision and a just rule he might have been
guided to good but left to his own devices outside and galled by
the iron yoke of parental discipline at home he became reckless and
prodigal The motherpoor timid Ellinor who had been rudely torn from
the love of her youth her cousin Lord Bellasistried to restrain him
but the headstrong boy though owning for his mother that strong love
which is often a part of such violent natures proved intractable and
after three years of parental feud he went off to the Continent to
pursue there the same reckless life which in London had offended Sir
Richard Sir Richard upon this sent for Maurice Frere his sisters
sonthe abolition of the slave trade had ruined the Bristol House of
Frereand bought for him a commission in a marching regiment hinting
darkly of special favours to come His open preference for his nephew
had galled to the quick his sensitive wife who contrasted with some
heartpangs the gallant prodigality of her father with the niggardly
economy of her husband Between the houses of parvenu Devine and
longdescended Wotton Wade there had long been little love Sir Richard
felt that the colonel despised him for a city knight and had heard that
over claret and cards Lord Bellasis and his friends had often lamented
the hard fortune which gave the beauty Ellinor to so sordid a
bridegroom Armigell Esme Wade Viscount Bellasis and Wotton was a
product of his time Of good family his ancestor Armigell was reputed
to have landed in America before Gilbert or Raleigh he had inherited
his manor of Bellasis or Belsize from one Sir Esme Wade ambassador
from Queen Elizabeth to the King of Spain in the delicate matter of
Mendoza and afterwards counsellor to James I and Lieutenant of the
Tower This Esme was a man of dark devices It was he who negotiated
with Mary Stuart for Elizabeth it was he who wormed out of Cobham the
evidence against the great Raleigh He became rich and his sister the
widow of Henry de Kirkhaven Lord of Hemfleet marrying into the family
of the Wottons the wealth of the house was further increased by the
union of her daughter Sybil with Marmaduke Wade Marmaduke Wade was a
Lord of the Admiralty and a patron of Pepys who in his diary July
171668 speaks of visiting him at Belsize He was raised to the peerage
in 1667 by the title of Baron Bellasis and Wotton and married for
his second wife Anne daughter of Philip Stanhope second Earl of
Chesterfield Allied to this powerful house the family tree of Wotton
Wade grew and flourished

In 1784 Philip third Baron married the celebrated beauty Miss Povey
and had issue Armigell Esme in whose person the family prudence seemed
to have run itself out

The fourth Lord Bellasis combined the daring of Armigell the
adventurer with the evil disposition of Esme the Lieutenant of the
Tower No sooner had he become master of his fortune than he took
to dice drink and debauchery with all the extravagance of the last
century He was foremost in every riot most notorious of all the
notorious bloods of the day

Horace Walpole in one of his letters to Selwyn in 1785 mentions a
fact which may stand for a page of narrative Young Wade he says is
reported to have lost one thousand guineas last night to that vulgarest
of all the Bourbons the Duc de Chartres and they say the fool is not
yet nineteen From a pigeon Armigell Wade became a hawk and at thirty
years of age having lost together with his estates all chance of
winning the one woman who might have saved himhis cousin Ellinorhe
became that most unhappy of all beings a wellborn blackleg When he
was told by thinlipped cool Colonel Wade that the rich shipbuilder
Sir Richard Devine had proposed an alliance with fairhaired gentle
Ellinor he swore with fierce knitting of his black brows that no
law of man nor Heaven should further restrain him in his selfish
prodigality You have sold your daughter and ruined me he said look
to the consequences Colonel Wade sneered at his fiery kinsman You
will find Sir Richards house a pleasant one to visit Armigell and he
should be worth an income to so experienced a gambler as yourself Lord
Bellasis did visit at Sir Richards house during the first year of his
cousins marriage but upon the birth of the son who is the hero of this
history he affected a quarrel with the city knight and cursing him
to the Prince and Poins for a miserly curmudgeon who neither diced nor
drank like a gentleman departed more desperately at war with fortune
than ever for his old haunts The year 1827 found him a hardened
hopeless old man of sixty battered in health and ruined in pocket but
who by dint of stays hairdye and courage yet faced the world with
undaunted front and dined as gaily in bailiffhaunted Belsize as he had
dined at Carlton House Of the possessions of the House of Wotton Wade
this old manor timberless and bare was all that remained and its
master rarely visited it

On the evening of May 3 1827 Lord Bellasis had been attending a pigeon
match at Hornsey Wood and having resisted the importunities of his
companion Mr Lionel Crofton a young gentlemanrake whose position
in the sporting world was not the most secure who wanted him to go on
into town he had avowed his intention of striking across Hampstead to
Belsize I have an appointment at the fir trees on the Heath he said

With a woman asked Mr Crofton

Not at all with a parson

A parson

You stare Well he is only just ordained I met him last year at Bath
on his vacation from Cambridge and he was good enough to lose some
money to me

And now waits to pay it out of his first curacy I wish your lordship
joy with all my soul Then we must push on for it grows late

Thanks my dear sir for the we but I must go alone said Lord
Bellasis dryly Tomorrow you can settle with me for the sitting of
last week Hark the clock is striking nine Good night


     


At halfpast nine Richard Devine quitted his mothers house to begin the
new life he had chosen and so drawn together by that strange fate of
circumstances which creates events the father and son approached each
other


     


As the young man gained the middle of the path which led to the Heath
he met Sir Richard returning from the village It was no part of his
plan to seek an interview with the man whom his mother had so deeply
wronged and he would have slunk past in the gloom but seeing him thus
alone returning to a desolated home the prodigal was tempted to utter
some words of farewell and of regret To his astonishment however Sir
Richard passed swiftly on with body bent forward as one in the act of
falling and with eyes unconscious of surroundings staring straight
into the distance Halfterrified at this strange appearance Richard
hurried onward and at a turn of the path stumbled upon something which
horribly accounted for the curious action of the old man A dead body
lay upon its face in the heather beside it was a heavy riding whip
stained at the handle with blood and an open pocketbook Richard took
up the book and read in gold letters on the cover Lord Bellasis

The unhappy young man knelt down beside the body and raised it
The skull had been fractured by a blow but it seemed that life yet
lingered Overcome with horrorfor he could not doubt but that his
mothers worst fears had been realizedRichard knelt there holding his
murdered father in his arms waiting until the murderer whose name he
bore should have placed himself beyond pursuit It seemed an hour to
his excited fancy before he saw a light pass along the front of the
house he had quitted and knew that Sir Richard had safely reached his
chamber With some bewildered intention of summoning aid he left the
body and made towards the town As he stepped out on the path he heard
voices and presently some dozen men one of whom held a horse burst
out upon him and with sudden fury seized and flung him to the ground

At first the young man so rudely assailed did not comprehend his own
danger His mind bent upon one hideous explanation of the crime did
not see another obvious one which had already occurred to the mind of
the landlord of the Three Spaniards

God defend me cried Mr Mogford scanning by the pale light of
the rising moon the features of the murdered man but it is Lord
Bellasisoh you bloody villain Jem bring him along here praps
his lordship can recognize him

It was not I cried Richard Devine For Gods sake my lord say
then he stopped abruptly and being forced on his knees by his captors
remained staring at the dying man in sudden and ghastly fear

Those men in whom emotion has the effect of quickening circulation
of the blood reason rapidly in moments of danger and in the terrible
instant when his eyes met those of Lord Bellasis Richard Devine had
summed up the chances of his future fortune and realized to the full
his personal peril The runaway horse had given the alarm The
drinkers at the Spaniards Inn had started to search the Heath and had
discovered a fellow in rough costume whose person was unknown to
them hastily quitting a spot where beside a rifled pocketbook and a
bloodstained whip lay a dying man


The web of circumstantial evidence had enmeshed him An hour ago escape
would have been easy He would have had but to cry I am the son of Sir
Richard Devine Come with me to yonder house and I will prove to
you that I have but just quitted itto place his innocence beyond
immediate question That course of action was impossible now Knowing
Sir Richard as he did and believing moreover that in his raging
passion the old man had himself met and murdered the destroyer of
his honour the son of Lord Bellasis and Lady Devine saw himself in
a position which would compel him either to sacrifice himself or to
purchase a chance of safety at the price of his mothers dishonour and
the death of the man whom his mother had deceived If the outcast son
were brought a prisoner to North End House Sir Richardnow doubly
oppressed of fatewould be certain to deny him and he would be
compelled in selfdefence to reveal a story which would at once bring
his mother to open infamy and send to the gallows the man who had been
for twenty years deceivedthe man to whose kindness he owed education
and former fortune He knelt stupefied unable to speak or move

Come cried Mogford again say my lord is this the villain

Lord Bellasis rallied his failing senses his glazing eyes stared into
his sons face with horrible eagerness he shook his head raised a
feeble arm as though to point elsewhere and fell back dead

If you didnt murder him you robbed him growled Mogford and you
shall sleep at Bow Street tonight Tom run on to meet the patrol and
leave word at the Gatehouse that Ive a passenger for the coachBring
him on JackWhats your name eh

He repeated the rough question twice before his prisoner answered but
at length Richard Devine raised a pale face which stern resolution had
already hardened into defiant manhood and said DawesRufus Dawes


     


His new life had begun already for that night one Rufus Dawes charged
with murder and robbery lay awake in prison waiting for the fortune of
the morrow

Two other men waited as eagerly One Mr Lionel Crofton the other the
horseman who had appointment with the murdered Lord Bellasis under the
shadow of the fir trees on Hampstead Heath As for Sir Richard Devine
he waited for no one for upon reaching his room he had fallen senseless
in a fit of apoplexy





BOOK ITHE SEA 1827




CHAPTER I THE PRISON SHIP



In the breathless stillness of a tropical afternoon when the air was
hot and heavy and the sky brazen and cloudless the shadow of the
Malabar lay solitary on the surface of the glittering sea

The sunwho rose on the left hand every morning a blazing ball to move
slowly through the unbearable blue until he sank fiery red in mingling
glories of sky and ocean on the right handhad just got low enough to
peep beneath the awning that covered the poopdeck and awaken a young
man in an undress military uniform who was dozing on a coil of rope

Hang it said he rising and stretching himself with the weary sigh
of a man who has nothing to do I must have been asleep and then
holding by a stay he turned about and looked down into the waist of the
ship

Save for the man at the wheel and the guard at the quarterrailing
he was alone on the deck A few birds flew round about the vessel and
seemed to pass under her stern windows only to appear again at her bows
A lazy albatross with the white water flashing from his wings rose
with a dabbling sound to leeward and in the place where he had been
glided the hideous fin of a silentlyswimming shark The seams of the
wellscrubbed deck were sticky with melted pitch and the brass plate of
the compasscase sparkled in the sun like a jewel There was no breeze
and as the clumsy ship rolled and lurched on the heaving sea her idle
sails flapped against her masts with a regularly recurring noise and
her bowsprit would seem to rise higher with the waters swell to
dip again with a jerk that made each rope tremble and tauten On the
forecastle some halfdozen soldiers in all varieties of undress were
playing at cards smoking or watching the fishinglines hanging over
the catheads

So far the appearance of the vessel differed in no wise from that of an
ordinary transport But in the waist a curious sight presented itself
It was as though one had built a cattlepen there At the foot of the
foremast and at the quarterdeck a strong barricade loopholed and
furnished with doors for ingress and egress ran across the deck from
bulwark to bulwark Outside this cattlepen an armed sentry stood on
guard inside standing sitting or walking monotonously within range
of the shining barrels in the arm chest on the poop were some sixty men
and boys dressed in uniform grey The men and boys were prisoners of
the Crown and the cattlepen was their exercise ground Their prison
was down the main hatchway on the tween decks and the barricade
continued down made its side walls

It was the fag end of the two hours exercise graciously permitted each
afternoon by His Majesty King George the Fourth to prisoners of the
Crown and the prisoners of the Crown were enjoying themselves It was
not perhaps so pleasant as under the awning on the poopdeck but
that sacred shade was only for such great men as the captain and his
officers Surgeon Pine Lieutenant Maurice Frere and most important
personages of all Captain Vickers and his wife

That the convict leaning against the bulwarks would like to have been
able to get rid of his enemy the sun for a moment was probable enough
His companions sitting on the combings of the mainhatch or crouched
in careless fashion on the shady side of the barricade were laughing
and talking with blasphemous and obscene merriment hideous to
contemplate but he with cap pulled over his brows and hands thrust
into the pockets of his coarse grey garments held aloof from their
dismal joviality

The sun poured his hottest rays on his head unheeded and though every
cranny and seam in the deck sweltered hot pitch under the fierce heat
the man stood there motionless and morose staring at the sleepy sea
He had stood thus in one place or another ever since the groaning
vessel had escaped from the rollers of the Bay of Biscay and the
miserable hundred and eighty creatures among whom he was classed had
been freed from their irons and allowed to sniff fresh air twice a day

The lowbrowed coarsefeatured ruffians grouped about the deck cast
many a leer of contempt at the solitary figure but their remarks were
confined to gestures only There are degrees in crime and Rufus Dawes
the convicted felon who had but escaped the gallows to toil for all his
life in irons was a man of mark He had been tried for the robbery and
murder of Lord Bellasis The friendless vagabonds lame story of finding
on the Heath a dying man would not have availed him but for the curious
fact sworn to by the landlord of the Spaniards Inn that the murdered
nobleman had shaken his head when asked if the prisoner was his
assassin The vagabond was acquitted of the murder but condemned to
death for the robbery and London who took some interest in the
trial considered him fortunate when his sentence was commuted to
transportation for life

It was customary on board these floating prisons to keep each mans
crime a secret from his fellows so that if he chose and the caprice of
his gaolers allowed him he could lead a new life in his adopted
home without being taunted with his former misdeeds But like other
excellent devices the expedient was only a nominal one and few out of
the doomed hundred and eighty were ignorant of the offence which their
companions had committed The more guilty boasted of their superiority
in vice the petty criminals swore that their guilt was blacker than it
appeared Moreover a deed so bloodthirsty and a respite so unexpected
had invested the name of Rufus Dawes with a grim distinction which his
superior mental abilities no less than his haughty temper and powerful
frame combined to support A young man of twoandtwenty owning to no
friends and existing among them but by the fact of his criminality
he was respected and admired The vilest of all the vile horde penned
between decks if they laughed at his fine airs behind his back
cringed and submitted when they met him face to facefor in a convict
ship the greatest villain is the greatest hero and the only nobility
acknowledged by that hideous commonwealth is that Order of the Halter
which is conferred by the hand of the hangman

The young man on the poop caught sight of the tall figure leaning
against the bulwarks and it gave him an excuse to break the monotony of
his employment

Here you he called with an oath get out of the gangway Rufus
Dawes was not in the gangwaywas in fact a good two feet from it but
at the sound of Lieutenant Freres voice he started and went obediently
towards the hatchway

Touch your hat you dog cries Frere coming to the quarterrailing
Touch your damned hat Do you hear

Rufus Dawes touched his cap saluting in half military fashion Ill
make some of you fellows smart if you dont have a care went on the
angry Frere half to himself Insolent blackguards

And then the noise of the sentry on the quarterdeck below him
grounding arms turned the current of his thoughts A thin tall
soldierlike man with a cold blue eye and prim features came out of
the cuddy below handing out a fairhaired affected mincing lady
of middle age Captain Vickers of Mr Freres regiment ordered for
service in Van Diemens Land was bringing his lady on deck to get an
appetite for dinner

Mrs Vickers was fortytwo she owned to thirtythree and had been
a garrisonbelle for eleven weary years before she married prim John
Vickers The marriage was not a happy one Vickers found his wife
extravagant vain and snappish and she found him harsh disenchanted
and commonplace A daughter born two years after their marriage was
the only link that bound the illassorted pair Vickers idolized little
Sylvia and when the recommendation of a long seavoyage for his failing
health induced him to exchange into the th he insisted upon bringing
the child with him despite Mrs Vickerss reiterated objections on the
score of educational difficulties He could educate her himself if
need be he said and she should not stay at home

So Mrs Vickers after a hard struggle gave up the point and her dreams
of Bath together and followed her husband with the best grace she could
muster When fairly out to sea she seemed reconciled to her fate and
employed the intervals between scolding her daughter and her maid in
fascinating the boorish young Lieutenant Maurice Frere

Fascination was an integral portion of Julia Vickerss nature
admiration was all she lived for and even in a convict ship with her
husband at her elbow she must flirt or perish of mental inanition
There was no harm in the creature She was simply a vain middleaged
woman and Frere took her attentions for what they were worth Moreover
her good feeling towards him was useful for reasons which will shortly
appear

Running down the ladder cap in hand he offered her his assistance

Thank you Mr Frere These horrid ladders I reallyhe hequite
tremble at them Hot Yes dear me most oppressive John the
campstool Pray Mr Frereoh thank you Sylvia Sylvia John have
you my smelling salts Still a calm I suppose These dreadful calms

This semifashionable slipslop within twenty yards of the wild beasts
den on the other side of the barricade sounded strange but Mr Frere
thought nothing of it Familiarity destroys terror and the incurable
flirt fluttered her muslins and played off her secondrate graces
under the noses of the grinning convicts with as much complacency as
if she had been in a Chatham ballroom Indeed if there had been
nobody else near it is not unlikely that she would have disdainfully
fascinated the tweendecks and made eyes at the most presentable of
the convicts there

Vickers with a bow to Frere saw his wife up the ladder and then
turned for his daughter

She was a delicatelooking child of six years old with blue eyes and
bright hair Though indulged by her father and spoiled by her
mother the natural sweetness of her disposition saved her from being
disagreeable and the effects of her education as yet only showed
themselves in a thousand imperious prettinesses which made her the
darling of the ship Little Miss Sylvia was privileged to go anywhere
and do anything and even convictism shut its foul mouth in her
presence Running to her fathers side the child chattered with all the
volubility of flattered selfesteem She ran hither and thither asked
questions invented answers laughed sang gambolled peered into the
compasscase felt in the pockets of the man at the helm put her tiny
hand into the big palm of the officer of the watch even ran down to the
quarterdeck and pulled the coattails of the sentry on duty

At last tired of running about she took a little striped leather ball
from the bosom of her frock and calling to her father threw it up
to him as he stood on the poop He returned it and shouting with
laughter clapping her hands between each throw the child kept up the
game

The convictswhose slice of fresh air was nearly eatenturned with
eagerness to watch this new source of amusement Innocent laughter and
childish prattle were strange to them Some smiled and nodded with
interest in the varying fortunes of the game One young lad could hardly
restrain himself from applauding It was as though out of the sultry
heat which brooded over the ship a cool breeze had suddenly arisen

In the midst of this mirth the officer of the watch glancing round the
fast crimsoning horizon paused abruptly and shading his eyes with his
hand looked out intently to the westward

Frere who found Mrs Vickerss conversation a little tiresome and
had been glancing from time to time at the companion as though in
expectation of someone appearing noticed the action

What is it Mr Best

I dont know exactly It looks to me like a cloud of smoke And
taking the glass he swept the horizon

Let me see said Frere and he looked also

On the extreme horizon just to the left of the sinking sun rested or
seemed to rest a tiny black cloud The gold and crimson splashed
all about the sky had overflowed around it and rendered a clear view
almost impossible

I cant quite make it out says Frere handing back the telescope We
can see as soon as the sun goes down a little

Then Mrs Vickers must of course look also and was prettily affected
about the focus of the glass applying herself to that instrument with
much girlish giggling and finally declaring after shutting one eye
with her fair hand that positively she could see nothing but sky and
believed that wicked Mr Frere was doing it on purpose

By and by Captain Blunt appeared and taking the glass from his
officer looked through it long and carefully Then the mizentop was
appealed to and declared that he could see nothing and at last the sun
went down with a jerk as though it had slipped through a slit in the
sea and the black spot swallowed up in the gathering haze was seen no
more

As the sun sank the relief guard came up the after hatchway and the
relieved guard prepared to superintend the descent of the convicts At
this moment Sylvia missed her ball which taking advantage of a sudden
lurch of the vessel hopped over the barricade and rolled to the feet
of Rufus Dawes who was still leaning apparently lost in thought
against the side

The bright spot of colour rolling across the white deck caught his eye
stooping mechanically he picked up the ball and stepped forward to
return it The door of the barricade was open and the sentrya young
soldier occupied in staring at the relief guarddid not notice the
prisoner pass through it In another instant he was on the sacred
quarterdeck

Heated with the game her cheeks aglow her eyes sparkling her golden
hair afloat Sylvia had turned to leap after her plaything but even as
she turned from under the shadow of the cuddy glided a rounded white
arm and a shapely hand caught the child by the sash and drew her back
The next moment the young man in grey had placed the toy in her hand

Maurice Frere descending the poop ladder had not witnessed this little
incident on reaching the deck he saw only the unexplained presence of
the convict uniform

Thank you said a voice as Rufus Dawes stooped before the pouting
Sylvia

The convict raised his eyes and saw a young girl of eighteen or nineteen
years of age tall and well developed who dressed in a loosesleeved
robe of some white material was standing in the doorway She had black
hair coiled around a narrow and flat head a small foot white skin
wellshaped hands and large dark eyes and as she smiled at him her
scarlet lips showed her white even teeth

He knew her at once She was Sarah Purfoy Mrs Vickerss maid but he
never had been so close to her before and it seemed to him that he was
in the presence of some strange tropical flower which exhaled a heavy
and intoxicating perfume

For an instant the two looked at each other and then Rufus Dawes was
seized from behind by his collar and flung with a shock upon the deck

Leaping to his feet his first impulse was to rush upon his assailant
but he saw the ready bayonet of the sentry gleam and he checked himself
with an effort for his assailant was Mr Maurice Frere

What the devil do you do here asked the gentleman with an oath You
lazy skulking hound what brings you here If I catch you putting your
foot on the quarterdeck again Ill give you a week in irons

Rufus Dawes pale with rage and mortification opened his mouth to
justify himself but he allowed the words to die on his lips What was
the use Go down below and remember what Ive told you cried Frere
and comprehending at once what had occurred he made a mental minute of
the name of the defaulting sentry

The convict wiping the blood from his face turned on his heel without
a word and went back through the strong oak door into his den Frere
leant forward and took the girls shapely hand with an easy gesture but
she drew it away with a flash of her black eyes

You coward she said

The stolid soldier close beside them heard it and his eye twinkled
Frere bit his thick lips with mortification as he followed the girl
into the cuddy Sarah Purfoy however taking the astonished Sylvia by
the hand glided into her mistresss cabin with a scornful laugh and
shut the door behind her




CHAPTER II SARAH PURFOY



Convictism having been safely got under hatches and put to bed in its
Government allowance of sixteen inches of space per man cut a little
short by exigencies of shipboard the cuddy was wont to pass some not
unpleasant evenings Mrs Vickers who was poetical and owned a guitar
was also musical and sang to it Captain Blunt was a jovial coarse
fellow Surgeon Pine had a mania for storytelling while if Vickers was
sometimes dull Frere was always hearty Moreover the table was well
served and what with dinner tobacco whist music and brandy and
water the sultry evenings passed away with a rapidity of which the
wild beasts tween decks cooped by sixes in berths of a mere five feet
square had no conception

On this particular evening however the cuddy was dull Dinner fell
flat and conversation languished

No signs of a breeze Mr Best asked Blunt as the first officer came
in and took his seat

None sir

Thesehe heawful calms says Mrs Vickers A week is it not
Captain Blunt

Thirteen days mum growled Blunt

I remember off the Coromandel coast put in cheerful Pine when we
had the plague in the Rattlesnake

Captain Vickers another glass of wine cried Blunt hastening to cut
the anecdote short

Thank you no more I have the headache

Headacheumdont wonder at it going down among those fellows It is
infamous the way they crowd these ships Here we have over two hundred
souls on board and not boat room for half of em

Two hundred souls Surely not says Vickers By the Kings
Regulations

One hundred and eighty convicts fifty soldiers thirty in ships crew
all told andhow manyone two threeseven in the cuddy How many
do you make that

We are just a little crowded this time says Best

It is very wrong says Vickers pompously Very wrong By the Kings
Regulations

But the subject of the Kings Regulations was even more distasteful to
the cuddy than Pines interminable anecdotes and Mrs Vickers hastened
to change the subject

Are you not heartily tired of this dreadful life Mr Frere

Well it is not exactly the life I had hoped to lead said Frere
rubbing a freckled hand over his stubborn red hair but I must make the
best of it

Yes indeed said the lady in that subdued manner with which one
comments upon a wellknown accident it must have been a great shock to
you to be so suddenly deprived of so large a fortune

Not only that but to find that the black sheep who got it all sailed
for India within a week of my uncles death Lady Devine got a letter
from him on the day of the funeral to say that he had taken his passage
in the Hydaspes for Calcutta and never meant to come back again

Sir Richard Devine left no other children

No only this mysterious Dick whom I never saw but who must have
hated me

Dear dear These family quarrels are dreadful things Poor Lady
Devine to lose in one day a husband and a son

And the next morning to hear of the murder of her cousin You know that
we are connected with the Bellasis family My aunts father married a
sister of the second Lord Bellasis

Indeed That was a horrible murder So you think that the dreadful man
you pointed out the other day did it

The jury seemed to think not said Mr Frere with a laugh but I
dont know anybody else who could have a motive for it However Ill go
on deck and have a smoke

I wonder what induced that old hunks of a shipbuilder to try to cut
off his only son in favour of a cub of that sort said Surgeon Pine to
Captain Vickers as the broad back of Mr Maurice Frere disappeared up
the companion

Some boyish follies abroad I believe selfmade men are always
impatient of extravagance But it is hard upon Frere He is not a bad
sort of fellow for all his roughness and when a young man finds that an
accident deprives him of a quarter of a million of money and leaves him
without a sixpence beyond his commission in a marching regiment under
orders for a convict settlement he has some reason to rail against
fate

How was it that the son came in for the money after all then

Why it seems that when old Devine returned from sending for his lawyer
to alter his will he got a fit of apoplexy the result of his rage I
suppose and when they opened his room door in the morning they found
him dead

And the sons away on the sea somewhere said Mr Vickers and knows
nothing of his good fortune It is quite a romance

I am glad that Frere did not get the money said Pine grimly sticking
to his prejudice I have seldom seen a face I liked less even among my
yellow jackets yonder

Oh dear Dr Pine How can you interjected Mrs Vickers Pon my
soul maam some of them have mixed in good society I can tell you
Theres pickpockets and swindlers down below who have lived in the best
company

Dreadful wretches cried Mrs Vickers shaking out her skirts John
I will go on deck

At the signal the party rose

Ecod Pine says Captain Blunt as the two were left alone together
you and I are always putting our foot into it

Women are always in the way aboard ship returned Pine

Ah Doctor you dont mean that I know said a rich soft voice at his
elbow

It was Sarah Purfoy emerging from her cabin

Here is the wench cries Blunt We are talking of your eyes my
dear Well theyll bear talking about captain wont they asked
she turning them full upon him

By the Lord they will says Blunt smacking his hand on the table
Theyre the finest eyes Ive seen in my life and theyve got the
reddest lips under m that

Let me pass Captain Blunt if you please Thank you doctor

And before the admiring commander could prevent her she modestly swept
out of the cuddy

Shes a fine piece of goods eh asked Blunt watching her A spice
o the devil in her too

Old Pine took a huge pinch of snuff

Devil I tell you what it is Blunt I dont know where Vickers picked
her up but Id rather trust my life with the worst of those ruffians
tween decks than in her keeping if Id done her an injury

Blunt laughed

I dont believe shed think much of sticking a man either he said
rising But I must go on deck doctor Pine followed him more slowly
I dont pretend to know much about women he said to himself but
that girls got a story of her own or Im much mistaken What brings
her on board this ship as ladysmaid is more than I can fathom And
as sticking his pipe between his teeth he walked down the now deserted
deck to the main hatchway and turned to watch the white figure gliding
up and down the poopdeck he saw it joined by another and a darker one
he muttered Shes after no good Ill swear

At that moment his arm was touched by a soldier in undress uniform who
had come up the hatchway What is it

The man drew himself up and saluted

If you please doctor one of the prisoners is taken sick and as the
dinners over and hes pretty bad I ventured to disturb your honour

You ass says Pinewho like many gruff men had a good heart under
his rough shellwhy didnt you tell me before and knocking the ashes
out of his barelylighted pipe he stopped that implement with a twist
of paper and followed his summoner down the hatchway

In the meantime the woman who was the object of the grim old fellows
suspicions was enjoying the comparative coolness of the night air
Her mistress and her mistresss daughter had not yet come out of their
cabin and the men had not yet finished their evenings tobacco The
awning had been removed the stars were shining in the moonless sky the
poop guard had shifted itself to the quarterdeck and Miss Sarah Purfoy
was walking up and down the deserted poop in close teteatete with no
less a person than Captain Blunt himself She had passed and repassed
him twice silently and at the third turn the big fellow peering into
the twilight ahead somewhat uneasily obeyed the glitter of her great
eyes and joined her

You werent put out my wench he asked at what I said to you
below

She affected surprise

What do you mean

Why at myat what Iat my rudeness there For I was a bit rude I
admit

I Oh dear no You were not rude

Glad you think so returned Phineas Blunt a little ashamed at what
looked like a confession of weakness on his part

You would have beenif I had let you

How do you know

I saw it in your face Do you think a woman cant see in a mans face
when hes going to insult her

Insult you hey Upon my word

Yes insult me Youre old enough to be my father Captain Blunt but
youve no right to kiss me unless I ask you

Haw haw laughed Blunt I like that Ask me Egad I wish you would
you blackeyed minx

So would other people I have no doubt That soldier officer for
instance Hey Miss Modesty Ive seen him looking at you as though hed
like to try

The girl flashed at him with a quick side glance

You mean Lieutenant Frere I suppose Are you jealous of him

Jealous Why damme the lad was only breeched the other day Jealous

I think you areand youve no need to be He is a stupid booby though
he is Lieutenant Frere

So he is You are right there by the Lord

Sarah Purfoy laughed a low fulltoned laugh whose sound made Blunts
pulse take a jump forward and sent the blood tingling down to his
fingers ends

Captain Blunt said she youre going to do a very silly thing

He came close to her and tried to take her hand

What

She answered by another question

How old are you

Fortytwo if you must know

Oh And you are going to fall in love with a girl of nineteen

Who is that

Myself she said giving him her hand and smiling at him with her rich
red lips

The mizen hid them from the man at the wheel and the twilight of
tropical stars held the maindeck Blunt felt the breath of this strange
woman warm on his cheek her eyes seemed to wax and wane and the hard
small hand he held burnt like fire

I believe you are right he cried I am half in love with you
already

She gazed at him with a contemptuous sinking of her heavily fringed
eyelids and withdrew her hand

Then dont get to the other half or youll regret it

Shall I asked Blunt Thats my affair Come you little vixen give
me that kiss you said I was going to ask you for below and he caught
her in his arms

In an instant she had twisted herself free and confronted him with
flashing eyes

You dare she cried Kiss me by force Pooh you make love like a
schoolboy If you can make me like you Ill kiss you as often as you
will If you cant keep your distance please

Blunt did not know whether to laugh or be angry at this rebuff He was
conscious that he was in rather a ridiculous position and so decided to
laugh

Youre a spitfire too What must I do to make you like me

She made him a curtsy

That is your affair she said and as the head of Mr Frere appeared
above the companion Blunt walked aft feeling considerably bewildered
and yet not displeased

Shes a fine girl by jingo he said cocking his cap and Im hanged
if she aint sweet upon me

And then the old fellow began to whistle softly to himself as he paced
the deck and to glance towards the man who had taken his place with no
friendly eyes But a sort of shame held him as yet and he kept aloof

Maurice Freres greeting was short enough

Well Sarah he said have you got out of your temper

She frowned

What did you strike the man for He did you no harm

He was out of his place What business had he to come aft One must
keep these wretches down my girl

Or they will be too much for you eh Do you think one man could
capture a ship Mr Maurice

No but one hundred might

Nonsense What could they do against the soldiers There are fifty
soldiers

So there are but

But what

Well never mind Its against the rules and I wont have it

Not according to the Kings Regulations as Captain Vickers would
say

Frere laughed at her imitation of his pompous captain

You are a strange girl I cant make you out Come and he took her
hand tell me what you are really

Will you promise not to tell

Of course

Upon your word

Upon my word

Well thenbut youll tell

Not I Come go on

Ladysmaid in the family of a gentleman going abroad

Sarah you cant be serious I am serious That was the advertisement
I answered

But I mean what you have been You were not a ladysmaid all your
life

She pulled her shawl closer round her and shivered

People are not born ladies maids I suppose

Well who are you then Have you no friends What have you been

She looked up into the young mans facea little less harsh at
that moment than it was wont to beand creeping closer to him
whisperedDo you love me Maurice

He raised one of the little hands that rested on the taffrail and
under cover of the darkness kissed it

You know I do he said You may be a ladysmaid or what you like
but you are the loveliest woman I ever met

She smiled at his vehemence

Then if you love me what does it matter If you loved me you would
tell me said he with a quickness which surprised himself

But I have nothing to tell and I dont love youyet

He let her hand fall with an impatient gesture and at that moment
Bluntwho could restrain himself no longercame up

Fine night Mr Frere

Yes fine enough

No signs of a breeze yet though

No not yet

Just then from out of the violet haze that hung over the horizon a
strange glow of light broke

Hallo cries Frere did you see that

All had seen it but they looked for its repetition in vain Blunt
rubbed his eyes

I saw it he said distinctly A flash of light They strained their
eyes to pierce through the obscurity

Best saw something like it before dinner There must be thunder in the
air

At that instant a thin streak of light shot up and then sank again
There was no mistaking it this time and a simultaneous exclamation
burst from all on deck From out the gloom which hung over the horizon
rose a column of flame that lighted up the night for an instant and
then sunk leaving a dull red spark upon the water

Its a ship on fire cried Frere




CHAPTER III THE MONOTONY BREAKS



They looked again the tiny spark still burned and immediately over it
there grew out of the darkness a crimson spot that hung like a lurid
star in the air The soldiers and sailors on the forecastle had seen
it also and in a moment the whole vessel was astir Mrs Vickers with
little Sylvia clinging to her dress came up to share the new sensation
and at the sight of her mistress the modest maid withdrew discreetly
from Freres side Not that there was any need to do so no one heeded
her Blunt in his professional excitement had already forgotten her
presence and Frere was in earnest conversation with Vickers

Take a boat said that gentleman Certainly my dear Frere by all
means That is to say if the captain does not object and it is not
contrary to the Regulations

Captain youll lower a boat eh We may save some of the poor
devils cries Frere his heartiness of body reviving at the prospect of
excitement

Boat said Blunt why shes twelve miles off and more and theres
not a breath o wind

But we cant let em roast like chestnuts cried the other as the
glow in the sky broadened and became more intense

What is the good of a boat said Pine The longboat only holds
thirty men and thats a big ship yonder

Well take two boatsthree boats By Heaven youll never let em burn
alive without stirring a finger to save em

Theyve got their own boats says Blunt whose coolness was in strong
contrast to the young officers impetuosity and if the fire gains
theyll take to em you may depend In the meantime well show em
that theres someone near em And as he spoke a blue light flared
hissing into the night

There theyll see that I expect he said as the ghastly flame rose
extinguishing the stars for a moment only to let them appear again
brighter in a darker heaven

Mr Bestlower and man the quarterboats Mr Frereyou can go in
one if you like and take a volunteer or two from those grey jackets
of yours amidships I shall want as many hands as I can spare to man the
longboat and cutter in case we want em Steady there lads Easy
and as the first eight men who could reach the deck parted to the
larboard and starboard quarterboats Frere ran down on the maindeck

Mrs Vickers of course was in the way and gave a genteel scream as
Blunt rudely pushed past her with a scarcemuttered apology but her
maid was standing erect and motionless by the quarterrailing and as
the captain paused for a moment to look round him he saw her dark eyes
fixed on him admiringly He was as he said over fortytwo burly
and greyhaired but he blushed like a girl under her approving gaze
Nevertheless he said only That wench is a trump and swore a little

Meanwhile Maurice Frere had passed the sentry and leapt down into the
tween decks At his nod the prison door was thrown open The air was
hot and that strange horrible odour peculiar to closelypacked human
bodies filled the place It was like coming into a full stable

He ran his eye down the double tier of bunks which lined the side of the
ship and stopped at the one opposite him

There seemed to have been some disturbance there lately for instead of
the six pair of feet which should have protruded therefrom the gleam of
the bullseye showed but four

Whats the matter here sentry he asked

Prisoner ill sir Doctor sent him to hospital

But there should be two

The other came from behind the break of the berths It was Rufus Dawes
He held by the side as he came and saluted

I felt sick sir and was trying to get the scuttle open

The heads were all raised along the silent line and eyes and ears were
eager to see and listen The double tier of bunks looked terribly like a
row of wild beast cages at that moment

Maurice Frere stamped his foot indignantly

Sick What are you sick about you malingering dog Ill give you
something to sweat the sickness out of you Stand on one side here

Rufus Dawes wondering obeyed He seemed heavy and dejected and passed
his hand across his forehead as though he would rub away a pain there

Which of you fellows can handle an oar Frere went on There curse
you I dont want fifty Threell do Come on now make haste

The heavy door clashed again and in another instant the four
volunteers were on deck The crimson glow was turning yellow now and
spreading over the sky

Two in each boat cries Blunt Ill burn a blue light every hour for
you Mr Best and take care they dont swamp you Lower away lads As
the second prisoner took the oar of Freres boat he uttered a groan and
fell forward recovering himself instantly Sarah Purfoy leaning over
the side saw the occurrence

What is the matter with that man she said Is he ill

Pine was next to her and looked out instantly Its that big fellow in
No 10 he cried Here Frere

But Frere heard him not He was intent on the beacon that gleamed ever
brighter in the distance Give way my lads he shouted And amid a
cheer from the ship the two boats shot out of the bright circle of the
blue light and disappeared into the darkness

Sarah Purfoy looked at Pine for an explanation but he turned abruptly
away For a moment the girl paused as if in doubt and then ere his
retreating figure turned to retrace its steps she cast a quick glance
around and slipping down the ladder made her way to the tween decks

The ironstudded oak barricade that loopholed for musketry and
perforated with plated trapdoor for sterner needs separated soldiers
from prisoners was close to her left hand and the sentry at its
padlocked door looked at her inquiringly She laid her little hand on
his big rough onea sentry is but mortaland opened her brown eyes at
him

The hospital she said The doctor sent me and before he could
answer her white figure vanished down the hatch and passed round the
bulkhead behind which lay the sick man




CHAPTER IV THE HOSPITAL



The hospital was nothing more nor less than a partitioned portion of the
lower deck filched from the space allotted to the soldiers It ran fore
and aft coming close to the stern windows and was in fact a sort of
artificial stern cabin At a pinch it might have held a dozen men

Though not so hot as in the prison the atmosphere of the lower deck was
close and unhealthy and the girl pausing to listen to the subdued hum
of conversation coming from the soldiers berths turned strangely sick
and giddy She drew herself up however and held out her hand to a man
who came rapidly across the misshapen shadows thrown by the sulkily
swinging lantern to meet her It was the young soldier who had been
that day sentry at the convict gangway

Well miss he said I am here yer see waiting for yer

You are a good boy Miles but dont you think Im worth waiting for

Miles grinned from ear to ear

Indeed you be said he

Sarah Purfoy frowned and then smiled

Come here Miles Ive got something for you

Miles came forward grinning harder

The girl produced a small object from the pocket of her dress If Mrs
Vickers had seen it she would probably have been angry for it was
nothing less than the captains brandyflask

Drink said she Its the same as they have upstairs so it wont
hurt you

The fellow needed no pressing He took off half the contents of the
bottle at a gulp and then fetching a long breath stood staring at
her

Thats prime

Is it I dare say it is She had been looking at him with unaffected
disgust as he drank Brandy is all you men understand Milesstill
sucking in his breathcame a pace closer

Not it said he with a twinkle in his little pigs eyes I
understand something else miss I can tell yer

The tone of the sentence seemed to awaken and remind her of her errand
in that place She laughed as loudly and as merrily as she dared and
laid her hand on the speakers arm The boyfor he was but a boy one
of those many illreared country louts who leave the ploughtail for
the musket and for a shilling a day experience all the pomp
and circumstance of glorious warreddened to the roots of his
closelycropped hair

There thats quite close enough Youre only a common soldier Miles
and you mustnt make love to me

Not make love to yer says Miles What did yer tell me to meet yer
here for then

She laughed again

What a practical animal you are Suppose I had something to say to
you

Miles devoured her with his eyes

Its hard to marry a soldier he said with a recruits proud
intonation of the word but yer might do worse miss and Ill work for
yer like a slave I will

She looked at him with curiosity and pleasure Though her time was
evidently precious she could not resist the temptation of listening to
praises of herself

I know youre above me Miss Sarah Youre a lady but I love yer I
do and you drives me wild with yer tricks

Do I

Do yer Yes yer do What did yer come an make up to me for and then
go sweetheartin with them others

What others

Why the cuddy folkthe skipper and the parson and that Frere I see
yer walkin the deck wi un o nights Dom um Id put a bullet through
his red head as soon as look at un

Hush Miles deartheyll hear you

Her face was all aglow and her expanded nostrils throbbed Beautiful as
the face was it had a tigerish look about it at that moment

Encouraged by the epithet Miles put his arm round her slim waist just
as Blunt had done but she did not resent it so abruptly Miles had
promised more

Hush she whispered with admirablyacted surpriseI heard a noise
and as the soldier started back she smoothed her dress complacently

There is no one cried he

Isnt there My mistake then Now come here Miles

Miles obeyed

Who is in the hospital

I dunno

Well I want to go in

Miles scratched his head and grinned

Yer carnt

Why not Youve let me in before Against the doctors orders He
told me special to let no one in but himself

Nonsense

It aint nonsense There was a convict brought in tonight and
nobodys to go near him

A convict She grew more interested Whats the matter with him

Dunno But hes to be kep quiet until old Pine comes down

She became authoritative

Come Miles let me go in

Dont ask me miss Its against orders and

Against orders Why you were blustering about shooting people just
now

The badgered Miles grew angry Was I Bluster or no bluster you dont
go in She turned away Oh very well If this is all the thanks I get
for wasting my time down here I shall go on deck again

Miles became uneasy

There are plenty of agreeable people there

Miles took a step after her

Mr Frere will let me go in I dare say if I ask him

Miles swore under his breath

Dom Mr Frere Go in if yer like he said I wont stop yer but
remember what Im doin of

She turned again at the foot of the ladder and came quickly back

Thats a good lad I knew you would not refuse me and smiling at the
poor lad she was befooling she passed into the cabin

There was no lantern and from the partiallyblocked stern windows came
only a dim vaporous light The dull ripple of the water as the ship
rocked on the slow swell of the sea made a melancholy sound and the
sick mans heavy breathing seemed to fill the air The slight noise
made by the opening door roused him he rose on his elbow and began to
mutter Sarah Purfoy paused in the doorway to listen but she could make
nothing of the low uneasy murmuring Raising her arm conspicuous by
its white sleeve in the gloom she beckoned Miles

The lantern she whispered bring me the lantern

He unhooked it from the rope where it swung and brought it towards her
At that moment the man in the bunk sat up erect and twisted himself
towards the light Sarah he cried in shrill sharp tones Sarah
and swooped with a lean arm through the dusk as though to seize her

The girl leapt out of the cabin like a panther struck the lantern out
of her lovers hand and was back at the bunkhead in a moment The
convict was a young man of about fourandtwenty His handsclutched
convulsively now on the blanketswere small and wellshaped and the
unshaven chin bristled with promise of a strong beard His wild black
eyes glared with all the fire of delirium and as he gasped for breath
the sweat stood in beads on his sallow forehead

The aspect of the man was sufficiently ghastly and Miles drawing
back with an oath did not wonder at the terror which had seized Mrs
Vickerss maid With open mouth and agonized face she stood in the
centre of the cabin lantern in hand like one turned to stone gazing
at the man on the bed

Ecod he be a sight says Miles at length Come away miss and shut
the door Hes raving I tell yer

The sound of his voice recalled her

She dropped the lantern and rushed to the bed

You fool hes choking cant you see Water give me water

And wreathing her arms around the mans head she pulled it down on her
bosom rocking it there half savagely to and fro

Awed into obedience by her voice Miles dipped a pannikin into a small
puncheon cleated in the corner of the cabin and gave it her and
without thanking him she placed it to the sick prisoners lips He
drank greedily and closed his eyes with a grateful sigh

Just then the quick ears of Miles heard the jingle of arms Heres the
doctor coming miss he cried I hear the sentry saluting Come away
Quick

She seized the lantern and opening the horn slide extinguished it

Say it went out she said in a fierce whisper and hold your tongue
Leave me to manage

She bent over the convict as if to arrange his pillow and then glided
out of the cabin just as Pine descended the hatchway

Hallo cried he stumbling as he missed his footing wheres the
light

Here sir says Miles fumbling with the lantern Its all right
sir It went out sir

Went out What did you let it go out for you blockhead growled the
unsuspecting Pine Just like you boobies What is the use of a light if
it goes out eh As he groped his way with outstretched arms in the
darkness Sarah Purfoy slipped past him unnoticed and gained the upper
deck




CHAPTER V THE BARRACOON



In the prison of the tween decks reigned a darkness pregnant with
murmurs The sentry at the entrance to the hatchway was supposed to
prevent the prisoners from making a noise but he put a very liberal
interpretation upon the clause and so long as the prisoners refrained
from shouting yelling and fightingeccentricities in which they
sometimes indulgedhe did not disturb them This course of conduct was
dictated by prudence no less than by convenience for one sentry was
but little over so many and the convicts if pressed too hard would
raise a sort of bestial boohoo in which all voices were confounded
and which while it made noise enough and to spare utterly precluded
individual punishment One could not flog a hundred and eighty men and
it was impossible to distinguish any particular offender So in
virtue of this last appeal convictism had established a tacit right to
converse in whispers and to move about inside its oaken cage

To one coming in from the upper air the place would have seemed
in pitchy darkness but the convict eye accustomed to the sinister
twilight was enabled to discern surrounding objects with tolerable
distinctness The prison was about fifty feet long and fifty feet wide
and ran the full height of the tween decks viz about five feet ten
inches high The barricade was loopholed here and there and the planks
were in some places wide enough to admit a musket barrel On the aft
side next the soldiers berths was a trap door like the stokehole of
a furnace At first sight this appeared to be contrived for the
humane purpose of ventilation but a second glance dispelled this weak
conclusion The opening was just large enough to admit the muzzle of
a small howitzer secured on the deck below In case of a mutiny the
soldiers could sweep the prison from end to end with grape shot Such
fresh air as there was filtered through the loopholes and came in
somewhat larger quantity through a windsail passed into the prison
from the hatchway But the windsail being necessarily at one end only
of the place the air it brought was pretty well absorbed by the twenty
or thirty lucky fellows near it and the other hundred and fifty did not
come so well off The scuttles were open certainly but as the row of
bunks had been built against them the air they brought was the peculiar
property of such men as occupied the berths into which they penetrated
These berths were twentyeight in number each containing six men They
ran in a double tier round three sides of the prison twenty at each
side and eight affixed to that portion of the forward barricade
opposite the door Each berth was presumed to be five feet six inches
square but the necessities of stowage had deprived them of six inches
and even under that pressure twelve men were compelled to sleep on
the deck Pine did not exaggerate when he spoke of the custom of
overcrowding convict ships and as he was entitled to half a guinea
for every man he delivered alive at Hobart Town he had some reason to
complain

When Frere had come down an hour before the prisoners were all snugly
between their blankets They were not so now though at the first clink
of the bolts they would be back again in their old positions to all
appearances sound asleep As the eye became accustomed to the foetid
duskiness of the prison a strange picture presented itself Groups
of men in all imaginable attitudes were lying standing sitting or
pacing up and down It was the scene on the poopdeck over again only
here being no fear of restraining keepers the wild beasts were a little
more free in their movements It is impossible to convey in words any
idea of the hideous phantasmagoria of shifting limbs and faces which
moved through the evilsmelling twilight of this terrible prisonhouse
Callot might have drawn it Dante might have suggested it but a minute
attempt to describe its horrors would but disgust There are depths in
humanity which one cannot explore as there are mephitic caverns into
which one dare not penetrate

Old men young men and boys stalwart burglars and highway robbers
slept side by side with wizened pickpockets or cunningfeatured
areasneaks The forger occupied the same berth with the bodysnatcher
The man of education learned strange secrets of housebreakers craft
and the vulgar ruffian of St Giles took lessons of selfcontrol from
the keener intellect of the professional swindler The fraudulent clerk
and the flash cracksman interchanged experiences The smugglers
stories of lucky ventures and successful runs were capped by the
footpads reminiscences of foggy nights and stolen watches The poacher
grimly thinking of his sick wife and orphaned children would start as
the nighthouse ruffian clapped him on the shoulder and bade him with a
curse to take good heart and be a man The fast shopboy whose love
of fine company and high living had brought him to this pass had
shaken off the first shame that was on him and listened eagerly to the
narratives of successful vice that fell so glibly from the lips of his
older companions To be transported seemed no such uncommon fate The
old fellows laughed and wagged their grey heads with all the glee of
past experience and listening youth longed for the time when it might
do likewise Society was the common foe and magistrates gaolers and
parsons were the natural prey of all noteworthy mankind Only fools were
honest only cowards kissed the rod and failed to meditate revenge on
that world of respectability which had wronged them Each newcomer was
one more recruit to the ranks of ruffianism and not a man penned in
that reeking den of infamy but became a sworn hater of law order and
freemen What he might have been before mattered not He was now
a prisoner andthrust into a suffocating barracoon herded with
the foulest of mankind with all imaginable depths of blasphemy
and indecency sounded hourly in his sight and hearinghe lost his
selfrespect and became what his gaolers took him to bea wild beast
to be locked under bolts and bars lest he should break out and tear
them

The conversation ran upon the sudden departure of the four What could
they want with them at that hour

I tell you theres something up on deck says one to the group nearest
him Dont you hear all that rumbling and rolling

What did they lower boats for I heard the dip o the oars

Dont know mate Praps a burial job hazarded a short stout
fellow as a sort of happy suggestion

One of those coves in the parlour said another and a laugh followed
the speech

No such luck You wont hang your jib for them yet awhile More like
the skipper agone fishin

The skipper dont go fishin yer fool What would he do
fishinspecial in the middle o the night

That ud be like old Dovery eh says a fifth alluding to an old
greyheaded fellow whoa returned convictwas again under sentence
for bodysnatching

Ay put in a young man who had the reputation of being the smartest
crow the lookout man of a burglars gang in Londonfishers of
men as the parson says

The snuffling imitation of a Methodist preacher was good and there was
another laugh

Just then a miserable little cockney pickpocket feeling his way to the
door fell into the party

A volley of oaths and kicks received him

I beg your pardon genlmen cries the miserable wretch but I want
hair

Go to the barbers and buy a wig then says the Crow elated at the
success of his last sally

Oh sir my back

Get up groaned someone in the darkness Oh Lord Im smothering
Here sentry

Vater cried the little cockney Give us a drop o vater for mercys
sake I havent moistned my chaffer this blessed day

Half a gallon a day bo and no more says a sailor next him

Yes what have yer done with yer halfgallon eh asked the Crow
derisively Someone stole it said the sufferer

Hes been an blued it squealed someone Been an blued it to buy
a Sunday veskit with Oh aint he a vicked young man And the speaker
hid his head under the blankets in humorous affectation of modesty

All this time the miserable little cockneyhe was a tailor by
tradehad been grovelling under the feet of the Crow and his
companions

Let me hup gents he imploredlet me hup I feel as if I should
dieI do

Let the gentleman up says the humorist in the bunk Dont yer see
his kerridge is avaitin to take him to the Hopera

The conversation had got a little loud and from the topmost bunk on
the near side a bullet head protruded

Aint a cove to get no sleep cried a gruff voice My blood if I
have to turn out Ill knock some of your empty heads together

It seemed that the speaker was a man of mark for the noise ceased
instantly and in the lull which ensued a shrill scream broke from the
wretched tailor

Help theyre killing me Ahhh

Wots the matter roared the silencer of the riot jumping from his
berth and scattering the Crow and his companions right and left Let
him be cant yer

Hair cried the poor devilhair Im fainting

Just then there came another groan from the man in the opposite bunk
Well Im blessed said the giant as he held the gasping tailor by
the collar and glared round him Heres a pretty go All the blessed
chickens ha got the croup

The groaning of the man in the bunk redoubled

Pass the word to the sentry says someone more humane than the rest
Ah says the humorist pass him out itll be one the less Wed
rather have his room than his company

Sentry heres a man sick

But the sentry knew his duty better than to reply He was a young
soldier but he had been well informed of the artfulness of convict
stratagems and moreover Captain Vickers had carefully apprised
him that by the Kings Regulations he was forbidden to reply to any
question or communication addressed to him by a convict but in the
event of being addressed was to call the noncommissioned officer on
duty Now though he was within easy hailing distance of the guard
on the quarterdeck he felt a natural disinclination to disturb those
gentlemen merely for the sake of a sick convict and knowing that in
a few minutes the third relief would come on duty he decided to wait
until then

In the meantime the tailor grew worse and began to moan dismally

Here ullo called out his supporter in dismay Hold up ere Wots
wrong with yer Dont come the drops ere Pass him down some of yer
and the wretch was hustled down to the doorway

Vater he whispered beating feebly with his hand on the thick oak

Get us a drink mister for Gords sake

But the prudent sentry answered never a word until the ships bell
warned him of the approach of the relief guard and then honest old
Pine coming with anxious face to inquire after his charge received
the intelligence that there was another prisoner sick He had the door
unlocked and the tailor outside in an instant One look at the flushed
anxious face was enough

Whos that moaning in there he asked

It was the man who had tried to call for the sentry an hour back and
Pine had him out also convictism beginning to wonder a little

Take em both aft to the hospital he said and Jenkins if there
are any more men taken sick let them pass the word for me at once I
shall be on deck

The guard stared in each others faces with some alarm but said
nothing thinking more of the burning ship which now flamed furiously
across the placid water than of peril nearer home but as Pine went up
the hatchway he met Blunt

Weve got the fever aboard

Good God Do you mean it Pine

Pine shook his grizzled head sorrowfully

Its this cursed calm thats done it though I expected it all along
with the ship crammed as she is When I was in the Hecuba

Who is it

Pine laughed a halfpitying halfangry laugh

A convict of course Who else should it be They are reeking like
bullocks at Smithfield down there A hundred and eighty men penned
into a place fifty feet long with the air like an ovenwhat could you
expect

Poor Blunt stamped his foot

It isnt my fault he cried The soldiers are berthed aft If the
Government will overload these ships I cant help it

The Government Ah The Government The Government dont sleep sixty
men aside in a cabin only six feet high The Government dont get
typhus fever in the tropics does it

Nobut

But what does the Government care then

Blunt wiped his hot forehead

Who was the first down

No 97 berth ten on the lower tier John Rex he calls himself

Are you sure its the fever

As sure as I can be yet Head like a fireball and tongue like a strip
of leather Gad dont I know it and Pine grinned mournfully Ive
got him moved into the hospital Hospital It is a hospital As dark as
a wolfs mouth Ive seen dog kennels I liked better

Blunt nodded towards the volume of lurid smoke that rolled up out of the
glowSuppose there is a shipload of those poor devils I cant refuse
to take em in

No says Pine gloomily I suppose you cant If they come I must
stow em somewhere Well have to run for the Cape with the first
breeze if they do come that is all I can see for it and he turned
away to watch the burning vessel




CHAPTER VI THE FATE OF THE HYDASPES



In the meanwhile the two boats made straight for the red column that
uprose like a gigantic torch over the silent sea

As Blunt had said the burning ship lay a good twelve miles from the
Malabar and the pull was a long and a weary one Once fairly away from
the protecting sides of the vessel that had borne them thus far on
their dismal journey the adventurers seemed to have come into a new
atmosphere The immensity of the ocean over which they slowly moved
revealed itself for the first time On board the prison ship surrounded
with all the memories if not with the comforts of the shore they had
quitted they had not realized how far they were from that civilization
which had given them birth The welllighted wellfurnished cuddy the
homely mirth of the forecastle the setting of sentries and the changing
of guards even the gloom and terror of the closelylocked prison
combined to make the voyagers feel secure against the unknown dangers of
the sea That defiance of Nature which is born of contact with humanity
had hitherto sustained them and they felt that though alone on the
vast expanse of waters they were in companionship with others of their
kind and that the perils one man had passed might be successfully dared
by another But nowwith one ship growing smaller behind them and the
other containing they knew not what horror of human agony and human
helplessness lying a burning wreck in the black distance ahead of
themthey began to feel their own littleness The Malabar that huge
sea monster in whose capacious belly so many human creatures lived and
suffered had dwindled to a walnutshell and yet beside her bulk how
infinitely small had their own frail cockboat appeared as they shot out
from under her towering stern Then the black hull rising above them
had seemed a tower of strength built to defy the utmost violence of
wind and wave now it was but a slip of wood floatingon an unknown
depth of black fathomless water The blue light which at its first
flashing over the ocean had made the very stars pale their lustre and
lighted up with ghastly radiance the enormous vault of heaven was now
only a point brilliant and distinct it is true but which by its very
brilliance dwarfed the ship into insignificance The Malabar lay on
the water like a glowworm on a floating leaf and the glare of the
signalfire made no more impression on the darkness than the candle
carried by a solitary miner would have made on the abyss of a coalpit

And yet the Malabar held two hundred creatures like themselves

The water over which the boats glided was black and smooth rising into
huge foamless billows the more terrible because they were silent When
the sea hisses it speaks and speech breaks the spell of terror when
it is inert heaving noiselessly it is dumb and seems to brood over
mischief The ocean in a calm is like a sulky giant one dreads that it
may be meditating evil Moreover an angry sea looks less vast in extent
than a calm one Its mounting waves bring the horizon nearer and
one does not discern how for many leagues the pitiless billows repeat
themselves To appreciate the hideous vastness of the ocean one must see
it when it sleeps

The great sky uprose from this silent sea without a cloud The stars
hung low in its expanse burning in a violent mist of lower ether The
heavens were emptied of sound and each dip of the oars was reechoed in
space by a succession of subtle harmonies As the blades struck the
dark water it flashed fire and the tracks of the boats resembled
two seasnakes writhing with silent undulations through a lake of
quicksilver

It had been a sort of race hitherto and the rowers with set teeth and
compressed lips had pulled stroke for stroke At last the foremost
boat came to a sudden pause Best gave a cheery shout and passed her
steering straight into the broad track of crimson that already reeked on
the sea ahead

What is it he cried

But he heard only a smothered curse from Frere and then his consort
pulled hard to overtake him

It was in fact nothing of consequenceonly a prisoner giving in

Curse it says Frere Whats the matter with you Oh you is
itDawes Of course Dawes I never expected anything better from such
a skulking hound Come this sort of nonsense wont do with me It isnt
as nice as lolloping about the hatchways I dare say but youll have to
go on my fine fellow

He seems sick sir said with compassionate bow

Sick Not he Shamming Come give way now Put your backs into it
and the convict having picked up his oar the boat shot forward again

But for all Mr Freres urging he could not recover the way he had
lost and Best was the first to run in under the black cloud that hung
over the crimsoned water

At his signal the second boat came alongside

Keep wide he said If there are many fellows yet aboard theyll
swamp us and I think there must be as we havent met the boats and
then raising his voice as the exhausted crew lay on their oars he
hailed the burning ship

She was a huge clumsilybuilt vessel with great breadth of beam and
a lofty poopdeck Strangely enough though they had so lately seen the
fire she was already a wreck and appeared to be completely deserted
The chief hold of the fire was amidships and the lower deck was one
mass of flame Here and there were great charred rifts and gaps in her
sides and the redhot fire glowed through these as through the bars of
a grate The mainmast had fallen on the starboard side and trailed a
blackened wreck in the water causing the unwieldy vessel to lean
over heavily The fire roared like a cataract and huge volumes of
flameflecked smoke poured up out of the hold and rolled away in a
lowlying black cloud over the sea

As Freres boat pulled slowly round her stern he hailed the deck again
and again

Still there was no answer and though the flood of light that dyed the
water bloodred struck out every rope and spar distinct and clear his
straining eyes could see no living soul aboard As they came nearer
they could distinguish the gilded letters of her name

What is it men cried Frere his voice almost drowned amid the roar
of the flames Can you see

Rufus Dawes impelled it would seem by some strong impulse of
curiosity stood erect and shaded his eyes with his hand

Wellcant you speak What is it

The Hydaspes

Frere gasped

The Hydaspes The ship in which his cousin Richard Devine had sailed
The ship for which those in England might now look in vain The Hydaspes
whichsomething he had heard during the speculations as to this missing
cousin flashed across him

Back water men Round with her Pull for your lives

Bests boat glided alongside

Can you see her name

Frere white with terror shouted a reply

The Hydaspes I know her She is bound for Calcutta and she has five
tons of powder aboard

There was no need for more words The single sentence explained the
whole mystery of her desertion The crew had taken to the boats on the
first alarm and had left their deathfraught vessel to her fate They
were miles off by this time and unluckily for themselves perhaps had
steered away from the side where rescue lay

The boats tore through the water Eager as the men had been to come
they were more eager to depart The flames had even now reached the
poop in a few minutes it would be too late For ten minutes or more not
a word was spoken With straining arms and labouring chests the
rowers tugged at the oars their eyes fixed on the lurid mass they were
leaving Frere and Best with their faces turned back to the terror
they fled from urged the men to greater efforts Already the flames had
lapped the flag already the outlines of the stern carvings were blurred
by the fire

Another moment and all would be over Ah it had come at last A dull
rumbling sound the burning ship parted asunder a pillar of fire
flecked with black masses that were beams and planks rose up out of
the ocean there was a terrific crash as though sea and sky were coming
together and then a mighty mountain of water rose advanced caught
and passed them and they were alonedeafened stunned and breathless
in a sudden horror of thickest darkness and a silence like that of the
tomb

The splashing of the falling fragments awoke them from their stupor and
then the blue light of the Malabar struck out a bright pathway across
the sea and they knew that they were safe


     


On board the Malabar two men paced the deck waiting for dawn

It came at last The sky lightened the mist melted away and then a
long low faroff streak of pale yellow light floated on the eastern
horizon By and by the water sparkled and the sea changed colour
turning from black to yellow and from yellow to lucid green The man at
the masthead hailed the deck The boats were in sight and as they came
towards the ship the bright water flashing from the labouring oars a
crowd of spectators hanging over the bulwarks cheered and waved their
hats

Not a soul cried Blunt No one but themselves Well Im glad
theyre safe anyway

The boats drew alongside and in a few seconds Frere was upon deck

Well Mr Frere

No use cried Frere shivering We only just had time to get away
The nearest thing in the world sir

Didnt you see anyone

Not a soul They must have taken to the boats

Then they cant be far off cried Blunt sweeping the horizon with his
glass They must have pulled all the way for there hasnt been enough
wind to fill a hollow tooth with Perhaps they pulled in the wrong
direction said Frere They had a good four hours start of us you
know

Then Best came up and told the story to a crowd of eager listeners The
sailors having hoisted and secured the boats were hurried off to the
forecastle there to eat and relate their experience between mouthfuls
and the four convicts were taken in charge and locked below again

You had better go and turn in Frere said Pine gruffly Its no use
whistling for a wind here all day

Frere laughedin his heartiest manner I think I will he said Im
dog tired and as sleepy as an owl and he descended the poop ladder
Pine took a couple of turns up and down the deck and then catching
Blunts eye stopped in front of Vickers

You may think it a hard thing to say Captain Vickers but its just
as well if we dont find these poor devils We have quite enough on our
hands as it is

What do you mean Mr Pine says Vickers his humane feelings getting
the better of his pomposity You would not surely leave the unhappy men
to their fate

Perhaps returned the other they would not thank us for taking them
aboard

I dont understand you

The fever has broken out

Vickers raised his brows He had no experience of such things and
though the intelligence was startling the crowded condition of the
prison rendered it easy to be understood and he apprehended no danger
to himself

It is a great misfortune but of course you will take such steps

It is only in the prison as yet says Pine with a grim emphasis on
the word but there is no saying how long it may stop there I have got
three men down as it is Well sir all authority in the matter is in
your hands Any suggestions you make I will of course do my best to
carry out

Thank ye I must have more room in the hospital to begin with The
soldiers must lie a little closer

I will see what can be done

And you had better keep your wife and the little girl as much on deck
as possible

Vickers turned pale at the mention of his child Good Heaven do you
think there is any danger

There is of course danger to all of us but with care we may escape
it Theres that maid too Tell her to keep to herself a little more
She has a trick of roaming about the ship I dont like Infection is
easily spread and children always sicken sooner than grownup people

Vickers pressed his lips together This old man with his harsh
dissonant voice and hideous practicality seemed like a bird of ill
omen

Blunt hitherto silently listening put in a word for defence of the
absent woman The wench is right enough Pine said he Whats the
matter with her

Yes shes all right Ive no doubt Shes less likely to take it than
any of us You can see her vitality in her faceas many lives as a cat
But shed bring infection quicker than anybody

IllIll go at once cried poor Vickers turning round The woman of
whom they were speaking met him on the ladder Her face was paler than
usual and dark circles round her eyes gave evidence of a sleepless
night She opened her red lips to speak and then seeing Vickers
stopped abruptly

Well what is it

She looked from one to the other I came for Dr Pine

Vickers with the quick intelligence of affection guessed her errand
Someone is ill

Miss Sylvia sir It is nothing to signify I think A little feverish
and hot and my mistress

Vickers was down the ladder in an instant with scared face

Pine caught the girls round firm arm Where have you been Two great
flakes of red came out in her white cheeks and she shot an indignant
glance at Blunt

Come Pine let the wench alone

Were you with the child last night went on Pine without turning his
head

No I have not been in the cabin since dinner yesterday Mrs Vickers
only called me in just now Let go my arm sir you hurt me

Pine loosed his hold as if satisfied at the reply I beg your pardon
he said gruffly I did not mean to hurt you But the fever has broken
out in the prison and I think the child has caught it You must be
careful where you go And then with an anxious face he went in
pursuit of Vickers

Sarah Purfoy stood motionless for an instant in deadly terror Her lips
parted her eyes glittered and she made a movement as though to retrace
her steps

Poor soul thought honest Blunt how she feels for the child D
that lubberly surgeon hes hurt herNever mind my lass he
said aloud It was broad daylight and he had not as much courage in
lovemaking as at night Dont be afraid Ive been in ships with fever
before now

Awaking as it were at the sound of his voice she came closer to him
But ship fever I have heard of it Men have died like rotten sheep in
crowded vessels like this

Tush Not they Dont be frightened Miss Sylvia wont die nor you
neither He took her hand It may knock off a few dozen prisoners or
so They are pretty close packed down there

She drew her hand away and then remembering herself gave it him
again

What is the matter

Nothinga pain I did not sleep last night

There there you are upset I dare say Go and lie down

She was staring away past him over the sea as if in thought So
intently did she look that he involuntarily turned his head and the
action recalled her to herself She brought her fine straight brows
together for a moment and then raised them with the action of a thinker
who has decided on his course of conduct

I have a toothache said she putting her hand to her face

Take some laudanum says Blunt with dim recollections of his mothers
treatment of such ailments Old Pinell give you some

To his astonishment she burst into tears

Therethere Dont cry my dear Hang it dont cry What are you
crying about

She dashed away the bright drops and raised her face with a rainy smile
of trusting affection Nothing I am lonely So far from home andand
Dr Pine hurt my arm Look

She bared that shapely member as she spoke and sure enough there were
three red marks on the white and shining flesh

The ruffian cried Blunt its too bad And after a hasty look
around him the infatuated fellow kissed the bruise Ill get the
laudanum for you he said You shant ask that bear for it Come into
my cabin

Blunts cabin was in the starboard side of the ship just under the poop
awning and possessed three windowsone looking out over the side and
two upon deck The corresponding cabin on the other side was occupied
by Mr Maurice Frere He closed the door and took down a small medicine
chest cleated above the hooks where hung his signalpictured telescope

Here said he opening it Ive carried this little box for years
but it aint often I want to use it thank God Now then put some o
this into your mouth and hold it there

Good gracious Captain Blunt youll poison me Give me the bottle
Ill help myself

Dont take too much says Blunt Its dangerous stuff you know

You need not fear Ive used it before

The door was shut and as she put the bottle in her pocket the amorous
captain caught her in his arms

What do you say Come I think I deserve a kiss for that

Her tears were all dry long ago and had only given increased colour to
her face This agreeable woman never wept long enough to make herself
distasteful She raised her dark eyes to his for a moment with a saucy
smile By and by said she and escaping gained her cabin It was
next to that of her mistress and she could hear the sick child feebly
moaning Her eyes filled with tearsreal ones this time

Poor little thing she said I hope she wont die

And then she threw herself on her bed and buried her hot head in the
pillow The intelligence of the fever seemed to have terrified her Had
the news disarranged some wellconcocted plan of hers Being near the
accomplishment of some cherished scheme long kept in view had the
sudden and unexpected presence of disease falsified her carefullymade
calculations and cast an almost insurmountable obstacle in her path

She die and through me How did I know that he had the fever Perhaps
I have taken it myselfI feel ill She turned over on the bed as
if in pain and then started to a sitting position stung by a sudden
thought Perhaps he might die The fever spreads quickly and if so
all this plotting will have been useless It must be done at once It
will never do to break down now and taking the phial from her pocket
she held it up to see how much it contained It was three parts full
Enough for both she said between her set teeth The action of
holding up the bottle reminded her of the amorous Blunt and she smiled
A strange way to show affection for a man she said to herself and
yet he doesnt care and I suppose I shouldnt by this time Ill go
through with it and if the worst comes to the worst I can fall back
on Maurice She loosened the cork of the phial so that it would come
out with as little noise as possible and then placed it carefully in
her bosom I will get a little sleep if I can she said They have
got the note and it shall be done tonight




CHAPTER VII TYPHUS FEVER



The felon Rufus Dawes had stretched himself in his bunk and tried to
sleep But though he was tired and sore and his head felt like lead he
could not but keep broad awake The long pull through the pure air if
it had tired him had revived him and he felt stronger but for all
that the fatal sickness that was on him maintained its hold his pulse
beat thickly and his brain throbbed with unnatural heat Lying in
his narrow spacein the semidarknesshe tossed his limbs about and
closed his eyes in vainhe could not sleep His utmost efforts induced
only an oppressive stagnation of thought through which he heard the
voices of his fellowconvicts while before his eyes was still the
burning Hydaspesthat vessel whose destruction had destroyed for ever
all trace of the unhappy Richard Devine

It was fortunate for his comfort perhaps that the man who had been
chosen to accompany him was of a talkative turn for the prisoners
insisted upon hearing the story of the explosion a dozen times over and
Rufus Dawes himself had been roused to give the name of the vessel with
his own lips Had it not been for the hideous respect in which he was
held it is possible that he might have been compelled to give his
version also and to join in the animated discussion which took place
upon the possibility of the saving of the fugitive crew As it was
however he was left in peace and lay unnoticed trying to sleep

The detachment of fifty being on deckairingthe prison was not quite
so hot as at night and many of the convicts made up for their lack of
rest by snatching a dogsleep in the bared bunks The four volunteer
oarsmen were allowed to take it out

As yet there had been no alarm of fever The three seizures had excited
some comment however and had it not been for the counterexcitement of
the burning ship it is possible that Pines precaution would have
been thrown away The Old Handswho had been through the Passage
beforesuspected but said nothing save among themselves It was
likely that the weak and sickly would go first and that there would be
more room for those remaining The Old Hands were satisfied

Three of these Old Hands were conversing together just behind the
partition of Dawess bunk As we have said the berths were five feet
square and each contained six men No 10 the berth occupied by Dawes
was situated on the corner made by the joining of the starboard and
centre lines and behind it was a slight recess in which the scuttle
was fixed His mates were at present but three in number for John Rex
and the cockney tailor had been removed to the hospital The three that
remained were now in deep conversation in the shelter of the recess Of
these the giantwho had the previous night asserted his authority
in the prisonseemed to be the chief His name was Gabbett He was
a returned convict now on his way to undergo a second sentence
for burglary The other two were a man named Sanders known as the
Moocher and Jemmy Vetch the Crow They were talking in whispers but
Rufus Dawes lying with his head close to the partition was enabled to
catch much of what they said

At first the conversation turned on the catastrophe of the burning ship
and the likelihood of saving the crew From this it grew to anecdote of
wreck and adventure and at last Gabbett said something which made the
listener start from his indifferent efforts to slumber into sudden
broad wakefulness

It was the mention of his own name coupled with that of the woman he
had met on the quarterdeck that roused him

I saw her speaking to Dawes yesterday said the giant with an oath
We dont want no more than weve got I aint goin to risk my neck for
Rexs womans fancies and so Ill tell her

It was something about the kid says the Crow in his elegant slang
I dont believe she ever saw him before Besides shes nuts on Jack
and aint likely to pick up with another man

If I thort she was agoin to throw us over Id cut her throat as soon
as look at her snorts Gabbett savagely

Jack ud have a word in that snuffles the Moocher and hes a curious
cove to quarrel with

Well stow yer gaff grumbled Mr Gabbett and lets have no more
chaff If were for bizness lets come to bizness

What are we to do now asked the Moocher Jacks on the sick list
and the gal wont stir athout him

Ay returned Gabbett thats it

My dear friends said the Crow my keyind and keristian friends it
is to be regretted that when natur gave you such tremendously thick
skulls she didnt put something inside of em I say that nows the
time Jacks in the orspital what of that That dont make it no
better for him does it Not a bit of it and if he drops his knife and
fork why then its my opinion that the gal wont stir a peg Its on
his account not ours that shes been manoovering aint it

Well says Mr Gabbett with the air of one who was but partly
convinced I spose it is

All the more reason of getting it off quick Another thing when the
boys know theres fever aboard youll see the rumpus therell be
Theyll be ready enough to join us then Once get the snapper chest and
were right as ninepennorth o hapence

This conversation interspersed with oaths and slang as it was had an
intense interest for Rufus Dawes Plunged into prison hurriedly tried
and by reason of his surroundings ignorant of the death of his
father and his own fortune he had hithertoin his agony and sullen
gloomheld aloof from the scoundrels who surrounded him and repelled
their hideous advances of friendship He now saw his error He knew that
the name he had once possessed was blotted out that any shred of his
old life which had clung to him hitherto was shrivelled in the fire
that consumed the Hydaspes The secret for the preservation of
which Richard Devine had voluntarily flung away his name and risked a
terrible and disgraceful death would be now for ever safe for Richard
Devine was deadlost at sea with the crew of the illfated vessel in
which deluded by a skilfullysent letter from the prison his mother
believed him to have sailed Richard Devine was dead and the secret of
his birth would die with him Rufus Dawes his alter ego alone should
live Rufus Dawes the convicted felon the suspected murderer should
live to claim his freedom and work out his vengeance or rendered
powerful by the terrible experience of the prisonsheds should seize
both in defiance of gaol or gaoler

With his head swimming and his brain on fire he eagerly listened for
more It seemed as if the fever which burnt in his veins had consumed
the grosser part of his sense and given him increased power of hearing
He was conscious that he was ill His bones ached his hands burned his
head throbbed but he could hear distinctly and he thought reason on
what he heard profoundly

But we cant stir without the girl Gabbett said Shes got to stall
off the sentry and give us the orfice

The Crows sallow features lighted up with a cunning smile

Dear old caper merchant Hear him talk said he as if he had the
wisdom of Solomon in all his glory Look here

And he produced a dirty scrap of paper over which his companions
eagerly bent their heads

Where did yer get that

Yesterday afternoon Sarah was standing on the poop throwing bits o
toke to the gulls and I saw her alooking at me very hard At last she
came down as near the barricade as she dared and throwed crumbs and
such like up in the air over the side By and by a pretty big lump
doughed up round fell close to my foot and watching a favourable
opportunity I pouched it Inside was this bit o ragbag

Ah said Mr Gabbett thats more like Read it out Jemmy

The writing though feminine in character was bold and distinct Sarah
had evidently been mindful of the education of her friends and had
desired to give them as little trouble as possible

All is right Watch me when I come up tomorrow evening at three bells
If I drop my handkerchief get to work at the time agreed on The sentry
will be safe

Rufus Dawes though his eyelids would scarcely keep open and a terrible
lassitude almost paralysed his limbs eagerly drank in the whispered
sentence There was a conspiracy to seize the ship Sarah Purfoy was
in league with the convictswas herself the wife or mistress of one of
them She had come on board armed with a plot for his release and this
plot was about to be put in execution He had heard of the atrocities
perpetrated by successful mutineers Story after story of such nature
had often made the prison resound with horrible mirth He knew the
characters of the three ruffians who separated from him by but two
inches of planking jested and laughed over their plans of freedom and
vengeance Though he conversed but little with his companions these men
were his berth mates and he could not but know how they would proceed
to wreak their vengeance on their gaolers

True that the head of this formidable chimeraJohn Rex the
forgerwas absent but the two hands or rather clawsthe burglar and
the prisonbreakerwere present and the slimlymade effeminate Crow
if he had not the brains of the master yet made up for his flaccid
muscles and nerveless frame by a catlike cunning and a spirit of
devilish volatility that nothing could subdue With such a powerful ally
outside as the mock maidservant the chance of success was enormously
increased There were one hundred and eighty convicts and but fifty
soldiers If the first rush proved successfuland the precautions taken
by Sarah Purfoy rendered success possiblethe vessel was theirs
Rufus Dawes thought of the little brighthaired child who had run so
confidingly to meet him and shuddered

There said the Crow with a sneering laugh what do you think of
that Does the girl look like nosing us now

No says the giant stretching his great arms with a grin of delight
as one stretches ones chest in the sun thats right that is Thats
more like bizness

England home and beauty said Vetch with a mockheroic air
strangely out of tune with the subject under discussion Youd like to
go home again wouldnt you old man

Gabbett turned on him fiercely his low forehead wrinkled into a frown
of ferocious recollection

You he saidYou think the chains fine sport dont yer But Ive
been there my young chicken and I knows what it means

There was silence for a minute or two The giant was plunged in gloomy
abstraction and Vetch and the Moocher interchanged a significant
glance Gabbett had been ten years at the colonial penal settlement of
Macquarie Harbour and he had memories that he did not confide to his
companions When he indulged in one of these fits of recollection his
friends found it best to leave him to himself

Rufus Dawes did not understand the sudden silence With all his senses
stretched to the utmost to listen the cessation of the whispered
colloquy affected him strangely Old artillerymen have said that after
being at work for days in the trenches accustomed to the continued roar
of the guns a sudden pause in the firing will cause them intense pain
Something of this feeling was experienced by Rufus Dawes His faculties
of hearing and thinkingboth at their highest pitchseemed to break
down It was as though some prop had been knocked from under him No
longer stimulated by outward sounds his senses appeared to fail him
The blood rushed into his eyes and ears He made a violent vain effort
to retain his consciousness but with a faint cry fell back striking
his head against the edge of the bunk

The noise roused the burglar in an instant There was someone in the
berth The three looked into each others eyes in guilty alarm and
then Gabbett dashed round the partition

Its Dawes said the Moocher We had forgotten him

Hell join us matehell join us cried Vetch fearful of bloodshed

Gabbett uttered a furious oath and flinging himself on to the prostrate
figure dragged it head foremost to the floor The sudden vertigo
had saved Rufus Dawess life The robber twisted one brawny hand in his
shirt and pressing the knuckles down prepared to deliver a blow that
should for ever silence the listener when Vetch caught his arm Hes
been asleep he cried Dont hit him See hes not awake yet

A crowd gathered round The giant relaxed his grip but the convict gave
only a deep groan and allowed his head to fall on his shoulder Youve
killed him cried someone

Gabbett took another look at the purpling face and the bedewed forehead
and then sprang erect rubbing at his right hand as though he would rub
off something sticking there

Hes got the fever he roared with a terrorstricken grimace

The what asked twenty voices

The fever ye grinning fools cried Gabbett Ive seen it before
today The typhus is aboard and hes the fourth man down

The circle of beastlike faces stretched forward to see the fight
widened at the halfuncomprehended illomened word It was as though
a bombshell had fallen into the group Rufus Dawes lay on the deck
motionless breathing heavily The savage circle glared at his prostrate
body The alarm ran round and all the prison crowded down to stare at
him All at once he uttered a groan and turning propped his body on
his two rigid arms and made an effort to speak But no sound issued
from his convulsed jaws

Hes done said the Moocher brutally He didnt hear nuffin Ill
pound it

The noise of the heavy bolts shooting back broke the spell The first
detachment were coming down from exercise The door was flung back
and the bayonets of the guard gleamed in a ray of sunshine that shot
down the hatchway This glimpse of sunlightsparkling at the entrance
of the foetid and stifling prisonseemed to mock their miseries It was
as though Heaven laughed at them By one of those terrible and strange
impulses which animate crowds the mass turning from the sick man
leapt towards the doorway The interior of the prison flashed white with
suddenly turned faces The gloom scintillated with rapidly moving hands
Air air Give us air

Thats it said Sanders to his companions I thought the news would
rouse em

Gabbettall the savage in his blood stirred by the sight of flashing
eyes and wrathful faceswould have thrown himself forward with the
rest but Vetch plucked him back

Itll be over in a moment he said Its only a fit theyve got He
spoke truly Through the uproar was heard the rattle of iron on iron as
the guard stood to their arms and the wedge of grey cloth broke in
sudden terror of the levelled muskets

There was an instants pause and then old Pine walked unmolested down
the prison and knelt by the body of Rufus Dawes

The sight of the familiar figure so calmly performing its familiar
duty restored all that submission to recognized authority which
strict discipline begets The convicts slunk away into their berths
or officiously ran to help the doctor with affectation of intense
obedience The prison was like a schoolroom into which the master had
suddenly returned Stand back my lads Take him up two of you and
carry him to the door The poor fellow wont hurt you His orders
were obeyed and the old man waiting until his patient had been safely
received outside raised his hand to command attention I see you know
what I have to tell The fever has broken out That man has got it It
is absurd to suppose that no one else will be seized I might catch it
myself You are much crowded down here I know but my lads I cant
help that I didnt make the ship you know

Ear ear

It is a terrible thing but you must keep orderly and quiet and bear
it like men You know what the discipline is and it is not in my power
to alter it I shall do my best for your comfort and I look to you to
help me

Holding his grey head very erect indeed the brave old fellow passed
straight down the line without looking to the right or left He had
said just enough and he reached the door amid a chorus of Ear ear
Bravo True for you docther and so on But when he got fairly
outside he breathed more freely He had performed a ticklish task and
he knew it

Ark at em growled the Moocher from his corner acheerin at the
bloody noos

Wait a bit said the acuter intelligence of Jemmy Vetch Give em
time Therell be three or four more down afore night and then well
see




CHAPTER VIII A DANGEROUS CRISIS



It was late in the afternoon when Sarah Purfoy awoke from her uneasy
slumber She had been dreaming of the deed she was about to do and was
flushed and feverish but mindful of the consequences which hung upon
the success or failure of the enterprise she rallied herself bathed
her face and hands and ascended with as calm an air as she could assume
to the poopdeck

Nothing was changed since yesterday The sentries arms glittered in
the pitiless sunshine the ship rolled and creaked on the swell of the
dreamy sea and the prisoncage on the lower deck was crowded with the
same cheerless figures disposed in the attitudes of the day before
Even Mr Maurice Frere recovered from his midnight fatigues was
lounging on the same coil of rope in precisely the same position

Yet the eye of an acute observer would have detected some difference
beneath this outward varnish of similarity The man at the wheel
looked round the horizon more eagerly and spit into the swirling
unwholesomelooking water with a more dejected air than before The
fishinglines still hung dangling over the catheads but nobody touched
them The soldiers and sailors on the forecastle collected in knots
had no heart even to smoke but gloomily stared at each other Vickers
was in the cuddy writing Blunt was in his cabin and Pine with two
carpenters at work under his directions was improvising increased
hospital accommodation The noise of mallet and hammer echoed in the
soldiers berth ominously the workmen might have been making coffins
The prison was strangely silent with the lowering silence which
precedes a thunderstorm and the convicts on deck no longer told
stories nor laughed at obscene jests but sat together moodily
patient as if waiting for something Three mentwo prisoners and
a soldierhad succumbed since Rufus Dawes had been removed to the
hospital and though as yet there had been no complaint or symptom
of panic the face of each man soldier sailor or prisoner wore an
expectant look as though he wondered whose turn would come next On the
shiprolling ceaselessly from side to side like some wounded creature
on the opaque profundity of that stagnant oceana horrible shadow had
fallen The Malabar seemed to be enveloped in an electric cloud whose
sullen gloom a chance spark might flash into a blaze that should consume
her

The woman who held in her hands the two ends of the chain that would
produce this spark paused came up upon deck and after a glance
round leant against the poop railing and looked down into the
barricade As we have said the prisoners were in knots of four and
five and to one group in particular her glance was directed Three men
leaning carelessly against the bulwarks watched her every motion

There she is right enough growled Mr Gabbett as if in continuation
of a previous remark Flash as ever and looking this way too

I dont see no wipe said the practical Moocher

Patience is a virtue most noble knuckler says the Crow with
affected carelessness Give the young woman time

Blowed if Im going to wait no longer says the giant licking his
coarse blue lips Ere weve been bluffed off day arter day and kep
dancin round the Dandys wench like a parcel o dogs The fevers
aboard and weve got all ready Whats the use o waitin Orfice or
no orfice Im for bizness at once

There look at that he added with an oath as the figure of
Maurice Frere appeared side by side with that of the waitingmaid and
the two turned away up the deck together

Its all right you confounded muddlehead cried the Crow losing
patience with his perverse and stupid companion How can she give us
the office with that cove at her elbow

Gabbetts only reply to this question was a ferocious grunt and a
sudden elevation of his clenched fist which caused Mr Vetch to retreat
precipitately The giant did not follow and Mr Vetch folding his
arms and assuming an attitude of easy contempt directed his attention
to Sarah Purfoy She seemed an object of general attraction for at the
same moment a young soldier ran up the ladder to the forecastle and
eagerly bent his gaze in her direction

Maurice Frere had come behind her and touched her on the shoulder Since
their conversation the previous evening he had made up his mind to be
fooled no longer The girl was evidently playing with him and he would
show her that he was not to be trifled with

Well Sarah

Well Mr Frere dropping her hand and turning round with a smile

How well you are looking today Positively lovely

You have told me that so often says she with a pout Have you
nothing else to say

Except that I love you This in a most impassioned manner

That is no news I know you do

Curse it Sarah what is a fellow to do His profligacy was failing
him rapidly What is the use of playing fast and loose with a fellow
this way

A fellow should be able to take care of himself Mr Frere I didnt
ask you to fall in love with me did I If you dont please me it is
not your fault perhaps

What do you mean

You soldiers have so many things to think ofyour guards and sentries
and visits and things You have no time to spare for a poor woman like
me

Spare cries Frere in amazement Why damme you wont let a fellow
spare Id spare fast enough if that was all She cast her eyes down
to the deck and a modest flush rose in her cheeks I have so much to
do she said in a halfwhisper There are so many eyes upon me I
cannot stir without being seen

She raised her head as she spoke and to give effect to her words
looked round the deck Her glance crossed that of the young soldier
on the forecastle and though the distance was too great for her to
distinguish his features she guessed who he wasMiles was jealous
Frere smiling with delight at her change of manner came close to
her and whispered in her ear She affected to start and took the
opportunity of exchanging a signal with the Crow

I will come at eight oclock said she with modestly averted face

They relieve the guard at eight he said deprecatingly

She tossed her head Very well then attend to your guard I dont
care

But Sarah consider

As if a woman in love ever considers said she turning upon him a
burning glance which in truth might have melted a more icy man than he
She loved him then What a fool he would be to refuse To get her to
come was the first object how to make duty fit with pleasure would be
considered afterwards Besides the guard could relieve itself for once
without his supervision

Very well at eight then dearest

Hush said she Here comes that stupid captain

And as Frere left her she turned and with her eyes fixed on the
convict barricade dropped the handkerchief she held in her hand over
the poop railing It fell at the feet of the amorous captain and with a
quick upward glance that worthy fellow picked it up and brought it to
her

Oh thank you Captain Blunt said she and her eyes spoke more than
her tongue

Did you take the laudanum whispered Blunt with a twinkle in his eye

Some of it said she I will bring you back the bottle tonight

Blunt walked aft humming cheerily and saluted Frere with a slap on the
back The two men laughed each at his own thoughts but their laughter
only made the surrounding gloom seem deeper than before

Sarah Purfoy casting her eyes toward the barricade observed a change
in the position of the three men They were together once more and the
Crow having taken off his prison cap held it at arms length with
one hand while he wiped his brow with the other Her signal had been
observed

During all this Rufus Dawes removed to the hospital was lying flat on
his back staring at the deck above him trying to think of something he
wanted to say

When the sudden faintness which was the prelude to his sickness had
overpowered him he remembered being torn out of his bunk by fierce
handsremembered a vision of savage faces and the presence of
some danger that menaced him He remembered that while lying on
his blankets struggling with the coming fever he had overheard a
conversation of vital importance to himself and to the ship but of
the purport of that conversation he had not the least idea In vain he
strove to rememberin vain his will struggling with delirium brought
back snatches and echoes of sense they slipped from him again as fast
as caught He was oppressed with the weight of halfrecollected thought
He knew that a terrible danger menaced him that could he but force his
brain to reason connectedly for ten consecutive minutes he could give
such information as would avert that danger and save the ship But
lying with hot head parched lips and enfeebled body he was as one
possessedhe could move nor hand nor foot

The place where he lay was but dimly lighted The ingenuity of Pine had
constructed a canvas blind over the port to prevent the sun striking
into the cabin and this blind absorbed much of the light He could but
just see the deck above his head and distinguish the outlines of three
other berths apparently similar to his own The only sounds that broke
the silence were the gurgling of the water below him and the Tap tap
Tap tap of Pines hammers at work upon the new partition By and by the
noise of these hammers ceased and then the sick man could hear gasps
and moans and mutteringsthe signs that his companions yet lived

All at once a voice called out Of course his bills are worth four
hundred pounds but my good sir four hundred pounds to a man in my
position is not worth the getting Why Ive given four hundred pounds
for a freak of my girl Sarah Is it right eh Jezebel Shes a
good girl though as girls go Mrs Lionel Crofton of the Crofts
Sevenoaks KentSevenoaks KentSeven

A gleam of light broke in on the darkness which wrapped Rufus Dawess
tortured brain The man was John Rex his berth mate With an effort he
spoke

Rex

Yes yes Im coming dont be in a hurry The sentrys safe and the
howitzer is but five paces from the door A rush upon deck lads and
shes ours That is mine Mine and my wifes Mrs Lionel Crofton
of Seven Crofts no oaksSarah Purfoy ladysmaid and nurseha
haladysmaid and nurse

This last sentence contained the nameclue to the labyrinth in which
Rufus Dawess bewildered intellects were wandering Sarah Purfoy
He remembered now each detail of the conversation he had so strangely
overheard and how imperative it was that he should without delay
reveal the plot that threatened the ship How that plot was to be
carried out he did not pause to consider he was conscious that he was
hanging over the brink of delirium and that unless he made himself
understood before his senses utterly deserted him all was lost

He attempted to rise but found that his feverthralled limbs refused to
obey the impulse of his will He made an effort to speak but his tongue
clove to the roof of his mouth and his jaws stuck together He could
not raise a finger nor utter a sound The boards over his head waved
like a shaken sheet and the cabin whirled round while the patch of
light at his feet bobbed up and down like the reflection from a wavering
candle He closed his eyes with a terrible sigh of despair and resigned
himself to his fate At that instant the sound of hammering ceased and
the door opened It was six oclock and Pine had come to have a last
look at his patients before dinner It seemed that there was somebody
with him for a kind though somewhat pompous voice remarked upon the
scantiness of accommodation and the necessitythe absolute necessity
of complying with the Kings Regulations

Honest Vickers though agonized for the safety of his child would not
abate a jot of his duty and had sternly come to visit the sick men
aware as he was that such a visit would necessitate his isolation from
the cabin where his child lay Mrs Vickersweeping and bewailing
herself coquettishly at garrison partieshad often said that poor dear
John was such a disciplinarian quite a slave to the service

Here they are said Pine six of em This fellowgoing to the
side of Rexis the worst If he had not a constitution like a horse I
dont think he could live out the night

Three eighteen seven four muttered Rex dot and carry one Is
that an occupation for a gentleman No sir Good night my lord good
night Hark The clock is striking nine five six seven eight Well
youve had your day and cant complain

A dangerous fellow says Pine with the light upraised A very
dangerous fellowthat is he was This is the place you seea regular
rathole but what can one do

Come let us get on deck said Vickers with a shudder of disgust

Rufus Dawes felt the sweat break out into beads on his forehead They
suspected nothing They were going away He must warn them With a
violent effort in his agony he turned over in the bunk and thrust out
his hand from the blankets

Hullo whats this cried Pine bringing the lantern to bear upon it
Lie down my man Ehwater is it There steady with it now and he
lifted a pannikin to the blackened frothfringed lips The cool draught
moistened his parched gullet and the convict made a last effort to
speak

Sarah Purfoytonightthe prisonMUTINY

The last word almost shrieked out in the sufferers desperate efforts
to articulate recalled the wandering senses of John Rex Hush he
cried Is that you Jemmy Sarahs right Wait till she gives the
word

Hes raving said Vickers

Pine caught the convict by the shoulder What do you say my man A
mutiny of the prisoners

With his mouth agape and his hands clenched Rufus Dawes incapable of
further speech made a last effort to nod assent but his head fell upon
his breast the next moment the flickering light the gloomy prison
the eager face of the doctor and the astonished face of Vickers
vanished from before his straining eyes He saw the two men stare at
each other in mingled incredulity and alarm and then he was floating
down the cool brown river of his boyhood on his wayin company with
Sarah Purfoy and Lieutenant Frereto raise the mutiny of the Hydaspes
that lay on the stocks in the old house at Hampstead




CHAPTER IX WOMANS WEAPONS



The two discoverers of this awkward secret held a council of war
Vickers was for at once calling the guard and announcing to the
prisoners that the plotwhatever it might behad been discovered but
Pine accustomed to convict ships overruled this decision

You dont know these fellows as well as I do said he In the first
place there may be no mutiny at all The whole thing is perhaps some
absurdity of that fellow Dawesand should we once put the notion of
attacking us into the prisoners heads there is no telling what they
might do

But the man seemed certain said the other He mentioned my wifes
maid too

Suppose he didand begad I dare say hes rightI never liked the
look of the girl To tell them that we have found them out this time
wont prevent em trying it again We dont know what their scheme is
either If it is a mutiny half the ships company may be in it No
Captain Vickers allow me as surgeonsuperintendent to settle our
course of action You are aware that

That by the Kings Regulations you are invested with full powers
interrupted Vickers mindful of discipline in any extremity Of course
I merely suggestedand I know nothing about the girl except that she
brought a good character from her last mistressa Mrs Crofton I think
the name was We were glad to get anybody to make a voyage like this

Well says Pine look here Suppose we tell these scoundrels that
their design whatever it may be is known Very good They will
profess absolute ignorance and try again on the next opportunity
when perhaps we may not know anything about it At all events we
are completely ignorant of the nature of the plot and the names of the
ringleaders Let us double the sentries and quietly get the men under
arms Let Miss Sarah do what she pleases and when the mutiny breaks
out we will nip it in the bud clap all the villains we get in irons
and hand them over to the authorities in Hobart Town I am not a cruel
man sir but we have got a cargo of wild beasts aboard and we must be
careful

But surely Mr Pine have you considered the probable loss of life
Ireallysome more humane course perhaps Prevention you know

Pine turned round upon him with that grim practicality which was a part
of his nature Have you considered the safety of the ship Captain
Vickers You know or have heard of the sort of things that take place
in these mutinies Have you considered what will befall those halfdozen
women in the soldiers berths Have you thought of the fate of your own
wife and child

Vickers shuddered

Have it your way Mr Pine you know best perhaps But dont risk more
lives than you can help

Be easy sir says old Pine I am acting for the best upon my soul
I am You dont know what convicts are or rather what the law has made
emyet

Poor wretches says Vickers who like many martinets was in reality
tenderhearted Kindness might do much for them After all they are
our fellowcreatures

Yes returned the other they are But if you use that argument to
them when they have taken the vessel it wont avail you much Let me
manage sir and for Gods sake say nothing to anybody Our lives may
hang upon a word

Vickers promised and kept his promise so far as to chat cheerily with
Blunt and Frere at dinner only writing a brief note to his wife to tell
her that whatever she heard she was not to stir from her cabin until
he came to her he knew that with all his wifes folly she would obey
unhesitatingly when he couched an order in such terms

According to the usual custom on board convict ships the guards
relieved each other every two hours and at six pm the poop guard was
removed to the quarterdeck and the arms which in the daytime
were disposed on the top of the armchest were placed in an armrack
constructed on the quarterdeck for that purpose Trusting nothing to
Frerewho indeed by Pines advice was as we have seen kept in
ignorance of the whole matterVickers ordered all the men save those
who had been on guard during the day to be under arms in the barrack
forbade communication with the upper deck and placed as sentry at the
barrack door his own servant an old soldier on whose fidelity he could
thoroughly rely He then doubled the guards took the keys of the prison
himself from the noncommissioned officer whose duty it was to keep
them and saw that the howitzer on the lower deck was loaded with grape
It was a quarter to seven when Pine and he took their station at the
main hatchway determined to watch until morning

At a quarter past seven any curious person looking through the window
of Captain Blunts cabin would have seen an unusual sight That gallant
commander was sitting on the bedplace with a glass of rum and water in
his hand and the handsome waitingmaid of Mrs Vickers was seated on a
stool by his side At a first glance it was perceptible that the captain
was very drunk His grey hair was matted all ways about his reddened
face and he was winking and blinking like an owl in the sunshine
He had drunk a larger quantity of wine than usual at dinner in sheer
delight at the approaching assignation and having got out the rum
bottle for a quiet settler just as the victim of his fascinations
glided through the carefullyadjusted door he had been persuaded to go
on drinking

Cuccome Sarah he hiccuped Its all very fine my lass but you
neednt be sohicproud you know Im a plain sailorplain slor
Srrh Phnas Bubblunt commander of the MalMal Malabar Wors sh
good talkin

Sarah allowed a laugh to escape her and artfully protruded an ankle at
the same time The amorous Phineas lurched over and made shift to take
her hand

You lovsh me and Ihiclovsh you Sarah And a preshus tight little
craft youhicare Givshkiss Sarah

Sarah got up and went to the door

Wotsh this Goin Sarah dont go and he staggered up and with the
grog swaying fearfully in one hand made at her

The ships bell struck the halfhour Now or never was the time Blunt
caught her round the waist with one arm and hiccuping with love and
rum approached to take the kiss he coveted She seized the moment
surrendered herself to his embrace drew from her pocket the laudanum
bottle and passing her hand over his shoulder poured half its contents
into the glass

Think Imhicdrunk do yer Nunnot I my wench

You will be if you drink much more Come finish that and be quiet or
Ill go away

But she threw a provocation into her glance as she spoke which belied
her words and which penetrated even the sodden intellect of poor
Blunt He balanced himself on his heels for a moment and holding by
the moulding of the cabin stared at her with a fatuous smile of drunken
admiration then looked at the glass in his hand hiccuped with much
solemnity thrice and as though struck with a sudden sense of duty
unfulfilled swallowed the contents at a gulp The effect was almost
instantaneous He dropped the tumbler lurched towards the woman at the
door and then making a halfturn in accordance with the motion of the
vessel fell into his bunk and snored like a grampus

Sarah Purfoy watched him for a few minutes and then having blown out
the light stepped out of the cabin and closed the door behind her The
dusky gloom which had held the deck on the previous night enveloped all
forward of the mainmast A lantern swung in the forecastle and swayed
with the motion of the ship The light at the prison door threw a glow
through the open hatch and in the cuddy at her right hand the usual
row of oillamps burned She looked mechanically for Vickers who was
ordinarily there at that hour but the cuddy was empty So much the
better she thought as she drew her dark cloak around her and tapped
at Freres door As she did so a strange pain shot through her temples
and her knees trembled With a strong effort she dispelled the dizziness
that had almost overpowered her and held herself erect It would never
do to break down now

The door opened and Maurice Frere drew her into the cabin So you have
come said he

You see I have But oh if I should be seen

Seen Nonsense Who is to see you

Captain Vickers Doctor Pine anybody

Not they Besides theyve gone off down to Pines cabin since dinner
Theyre all right

Gone off to Pines cabin The intelligence struck her with dismay
What was the cause of such an unusual proceeding Surely they did not
suspect What do they want there she asked

Maurice Frere was not in the humour to argue questions of probability
Who knows I dont Confound em he added what does it matter to
us We dont want them do we Sarah

She seemed to be listening for something and did not reply Her nervous
system was wound up to the highest pitch of excitement The success of
the plot depended on the next five minutes

What are you staring at Look at me cant you What eyes you have And
what hair

At that instant the report of a musketshot broke the silence The
mutiny had begun

The sound awoke the soldier to a sense of his duty He sprang to his
feet and disengaging the arms that clung about his neck made for
the door The moment for which the convicts accomplice had waited
approached She hung upon him with all her weight Her long hair swept
across his face her warm breath was on his cheek her dress exposed
her round smooth shoulder He intoxicated conquered had halfturned
back when suddenly the rich crimson died away from her lips leaving
them an ashen grey colour Her eyes closed in agony loosing her hold
of him she staggered to her feet pressed her hands upon her bosom and
uttered a sharp cry of pain

The fever which had been on her two days and which by a strong
exercise of will she had struggled againstencouraged by the violent
excitement of the occasionhad attacked her at this supreme moment
Deathly pale and sick she reeled to the side of the cabin There was
another shot and a violent clashing of arms and Frere leaving the
miserable woman to her fate leapt out on to the deck




CHAPTER X EIGHT BELLS



At seven oclock there had been also a commotion in the prison The news
of the fever had awoke in the convicts all that love of liberty which
had but slumbered during the monotony of the earlier part of the voyage
Now that death menaced them they longed fiercely for the chance of
escape which seemed permitted to freemen Let us get out they said
each man speaking to his particular friend We are locked up here to
die like sheep Gloomy faces and desponding looks met the gaze of each
and sometimes across this gloom shot a fierce glance that lighted up
its blackness as a lightningflash renders luridly luminous the indigo
dullness of a thundercloud By and by in some inexplicable way it
came to be understood that there was a conspiracy afloat that they
were to be released from their shambles that some amongst them had been
plotting for freedom The tween decks held its foul breath in wondering
anxiety afraid to breathe its suspicions The influence of this
predominant idea showed itself by a strange shifting of atoms The
mass of villainy ignorance and innocence began to be animated with
something like a uniform movement Natural affinities came together
and like allied itself to like falling noiselessly into harmony as the
pieces of glass and coloured beads in a kaleidoscope assume mathematical
forms By seven bells it was found that the prison was divided into
three partiesthe desperate the timid and the cautious These three
parties had arranged themselves in natural sequence The mutineers
headed by Gabbett Vetch and the Moocher were nearest to the door the
timidboys old men innocent poor wretches condemned on circumstantial
evidence or rustics condemned to be turned into thieves for pulling
a turnipwere at the farther end huddling together in alarm and the
prudentthat is to say all the rest ready to fight or fly advance or
retreat assist the authorities or their companions as the fortune of
the day might directoccupied the middle space The mutineers proper
numbered perhaps some thirty men and of these thirty only half a
dozen knew what was really about to be done

The ships bell strikes the halfhour and as the cries of the three
sentries passing the word to the quarterdeck die away Gabbett who has
been leaning with his back against the door nudges Jemmy Vetch

Now Jemmy says he in a whisper tell em

The whisper being heard by those nearest the giant a silence ensues
which gradually spreads like a ripple over the surface of the crowd
reaching even the bunks at the further end

Gentlemen says Mr Vetch politely sarcastic in his own hangdog
fashion myself and my friends here are going to take the ship for you
Those who like to join us had better speak at once for in about half an
hour they will not have the opportunity

He pauses and looks round with such an impertinently confident air
that three waverers in the party amidships slip nearer to hear him

You neednt be afraid Mr Vetch continues we have arranged it all
for you There are friends waiting for us outside and the door will be
open directly All we want gentlemen is your vote and interestI mean
your

Gaffing agin interrupts the giant angrily Come to business carnt
yer Tell em they may like it or lump it but we mean to have the ship
and them as refuses to join us we mean to chuck overboard Thats about
the plain English of it

This practical way of putting it produces a sensation and the
conservative party at the other end look in each others faces with some
alarm A grim murmur runs round and somebody near Mr Gabbett laughs a
laugh of mingled ferocity and amusement not reassuring to timid people
What about the sogers asked a voice from the ranks of the cautious

D the sogers cries the Moocher moved by a sudden inspiration
They can but shoot yer and thats as good as dyin of typhus anyway

The right chord had been struck now and with a stifled roar the prison
admitted the truth of the sentiment Go on old man cries Jemmy Vetch
to the giant rubbing his thin hands with eldritch glee Theyre all
right And then his quick ears catching the jingle of arms he said
Stand by now for the doorone rushll do it

It was eight oclock and the relief guard was coming from the after
deck The crowd of prisoners round the door held their breath to listen
Its all planned says Gabbett in a low growl Wen the door hopens
we rush and were in among the guard afore they know where they are
Drag em back into the prison grab the harmrack and its all over

Theyre very quiet about it says the Crow suspiciously I hope its
all right

Stand from the door Miles says Pines voice outside in its usual
calm accents

The Crow was relieved The tone was an ordinary one and Miles was the
soldier whom Sarah Purfoy had bribed not to fire All had gone well

The keys clashed and turned and the bravest of the prudent party
who had been turning in his mind the notion of risking his life for a
pardon to be won by rushing forward at the right moment and alarming
the guard checked the cry that was in his throat as he saw the men
round the door draw back a little for their rush and caught a glimpse
of the giants bristling scalp and bared gums

NOW cries Jemmy Vetch as the ironplated oak swung back and with
the guttural snarl of a charging wild boar Gabbett hurled himself out
of the prison

The red line of light which glowed for an instant through the doorway
was blotted out by a mass of figures All the prison surged forward and
before the eye could wink five ten twenty of the most desperate
were outside It was as though a sea breaking against a stone wall
had found some breach through which to pour its waters The contagion
of battle spread Caution was forgotten and those at the back seeing
Jemmy Vetch raised upon the crest of that human billow which reared its
black outline against an indistinct perspective of struggling figures
responded to his grin of encouragement by rushing furiously forward

Suddenly a horrible roar like that of a trapped wild beast was heard
The rushing torrent choked in the doorway and from out the lantern glow
into which the giant had rushed a flash broke followed by a groan as
the perfidious sentry fell back shot through the breast The mass in
the doorway hung irresolute and then by sheer weight of pressure from
behind burst forward and as it so burst the heavy door crashed into
its jambs and the bolts were shot into their places

All this took place by one of those simultaneous movements which are so
rapid in execution so tedious to describe in detail At one instant the
prison door had opened at the next it had closed The picture which
had presented itself to the eyes of the convicts was as momentary as are
those of the thaumatoscope The period of time that had elapsed between
the opening and the shutting of the door could have been marked by the
musket shot

The report of another shot and then a noise of confused cries mingled
with the clashing of arms informed the imprisoned men that the ship
had been alarmed How would it go with their friends on deck Would they
succeed in overcoming the guards or would they be beaten back They
would soon know and in the hot dusk straining their eyes to see each
other they waited for the issue Suddenly the noises ceased and a
strange rumbling sound fell upon the ears of the listeners


     


What had taken place

Thisthe men pouring out of the darkness into the sudden glare of
the lanterns rushed bewildered across the deck Miles true to his
promise did not fire but the next instant Vickers had snatched the
firelock from him and leaping into the stream turned about and
fired down towards the prison The attack was more sudden then he had
expected but he did not lose his presence of mind The shot would serve
a double purpose It would warn the men in the barrack and perhaps
check the rush by stopping up the doorway with a corpse Beaten back
struggling and indignant amid the storm of hideous faces his humanity
vanished and he aimed deliberately at the head of Mr James Vetch the
shot however missed its mark and killed the unhappy Miles

Gabbett and his companions had by this time reached the foot of the
companion ladder there to encounter the cutlasses of the doubled guard
gleaming redly in the glow of the lanterns A glance up the hatchway
showed the giant that the arms he had planned to seize were defended by
ten firelocks and that behind the open doors of the partition which
ran abaft the mizenmast the remainder of the detachment stood to their
arms Even his dull intellect comprehended that the desperate project
had failed and that he had been betrayed With the roar of despair
which had penetrated into the prison he turned to fight his way back
just in time to see the crowd in the gangway recoil from the flash of
the musket fired by Vickers The next instant Pine and two soldiers
taking advantage of the momentary cessation of the press shot the
bolts and secured the prison

The mutineers were caught in a trap

The narrow space between the barracks and the barricade was choked with
struggling figures Some twenty convicts and half as many soldiers
struck and stabbed at each other in the crowd There was barely
elbowroom and attacked and attackers fought almost without knowing
whom they struck Gabbett tore a cutlass from a soldier shook his
huge head and calling on the Moocher to follow bounded up the ladder
desperately determined to brave the fire of the watch The Moocher
close at the giants heels flung himself upon the nearest soldier and
grasping his wrist struggled for the cutlass A brawny bullnecked
fellow next him dashed his clenched fist in the soldiers face and the
man maddened by the blow let go the cutlass and drawing his pistol
shot his new assailant through the head It was this second shot that
had aroused Maurice Frere

As the young lieutenant sprang out upon the deck he saw by the position
of the guard that others had been more mindful of the safety of the ship
than he There was however no time for explanation for as he reached
the hatchway he was met by the ascending giant who uttered a hideous
oath at the sight of this unexpected adversary and too close to strike
him locked him in his arms The two men were drawn together The guard
on the quarterdeck dared not fire at the two bodies that twined
about each other rolled across the deck and for a moment Mr Freres
cherished existence hung upon the slenderest thread imaginable

The Moocher spattered with the blood and brains of his unfortunate
comrade had already set his foot upon the lowest step of the ladder
when the cutlass was dashed from his hand by a blow from a clubbed
firelock and he was dragged roughly backwards As he fell upon the
deck he saw the Crow spring out of the mass of prisoners who had been
an instant before struggling with the guard and gaining the cleared
space at the bottom of the ladder hold up his hands as though to
shield himself from a blow The confusion had now become suddenly
stilled and upon the group before the barricade had fallen that
mysterious silence which had perplexed the inmates of the prison

They were not perplexed for long The two soldiers who with the
assistance of Pine had forcedto the door of the prison rapidly
unbolted that trapdoor in the barricade of which mention has been made
in a previous chapter and at a signal from Vickers three men ran the
loaded howitzer from its sinister shelter near the break of the barrack
berths and training the deadly muzzle to a level with the opening in
the barricade stood ready to fire

Surrender cried Vickers in a voice from which all humanity had
vanished Surrender and give up your ringleaders or Ill blow you to
pieces

There was no tremor in his voice and though he stood with Pine by his
side at the very mouth of the levelled cannon the mutineers perceived
with that acuteness which imminent danger brings to the most stolid
of brains that did they hesitate an instant he would keep his word
There was an awful moment of silence broken only by a skurrying noise
in the prison as though a family of rats disturbed at a flour cask
were scampering to the ships side for shelter This skurrying noise was
made by the convicts rushing to their berths to escape the threatened
shower of grape to the twenty desperadoes cowering before the muzzle of
the howitzer it spoke more eloquently than words The charm was broken
their comrades would refuse to join them The position of affairs at
this crisis was a strange one From the opened trapdoor came a sort of
subdued murmur like that which sounds within the folds of a seashell
but in the oblong block of darkness which it framed nothing was
visible The trapdoor might have been a window looking into a tunnel
On each side of this horrible window almost pushed before it by the
pressure of one upon the other stood Pine Vickers and the guard In
front of the little group lay the corpse of the miserable boy whom Sarah
Purfoy had led to ruin and forced close upon yet shrinking back from
the trampled and bloody mass crouched in mingled terror and rage the
twenty mutineers Behind the mutineers withdrawn from the patch of
light thrown by the open hatchway the mouth of the howitzer threatened
destruction and behind the howitzer backed up by an array of brown
musket barrels suddenly glowed the tiny fire of the burning match in
the hand of Vickerss trusty servant

The entrapped men looked up the hatchway but the guard had already
closed in upon it and some of the ships crewwith that carelessness
of danger characteristic of sailorswere peering down upon them Escape
was hopeless

One minute cried Vickers confident that one second would be
enoughone minute to go quietly or

Surrender mates for Gods sake shrieked some unknown wretch from
out of the darkness of the prison Do you want to be the death of us

Jemmy Vetch feeling by that curious sympathy which nervous natures
possess that his comrades wished him to act as spokesman raised his
shrill tones We surrender he said Its no use getting our brains
blown out And raising his hands he obeyed the motion of Vickerss
fingers and led the way towards the barrack

Bring the irons forward there shouted Vickers hastening from his
perilous position and before the last man had filed past the still
smoking match the cling of hammers announced that the Crow had resumed
those fetters which had been knocked off his dainty limbs a month
previously in the Bay of Biscay

In another moment the trapdoor was closed the howitzer rumbled back to
its cleatings and the prison breathed again


     


In the meantime a scene almost as exciting had taken place on the upper
deck Gabbett with the blind fury which the consciousness of failure
brings to such brutelike natures had seized Frere by the throat
determined to put an end to at least one of his enemies But desperate
though he was and with all the advantage of weight and strength upon
his side he found the young lieutenant a more formidable adversary than
he had anticipated

Maurice Frere was no coward Brutal and selfish though he might be his
bitterest enemies had never accused him of lack of physical courage
Indeed he had beenin the rollicking days of old that were
gonecelebrated for the display of very opposite qualities He was an
amateur at manly sports He rejoiced in his muscular strength and in
many a tavern brawl and midnight riot of his own provoking had proved
the fallacy of the proverb which teaches that a bully is always a
coward He had the tenacity of a bulldogonce let him get his teeth in
his adversary and he would hold on till he died In fact he was as
far as personal vigour went a Gabbett with the education of a
prizefighter and in a personal encounter between two men of equal
courage science tells more than strength In the struggle however
that was now taking place science seemed to be of little value To the
inexperienced eye it would appear that the frenzied giant gripping
the throat of the man who had fallen beneath him must rise from the
struggle an easy victor Brute force was all that was neededthere was
neither room nor time for the display of any cunning of fence

But knowledge though it cannot give strength gives coolness Taken by
surprise as he was Maurice Frere did not lose his presence of mind The
convict was so close upon him that there was no time to strike but
as he was forced backwards he succeeded in crooking his knee round the
thigh of his assailant and thrust one hand into his collar Over and
over they rolled the bewildered sentry not daring to fire until the
ships side brought them up with a violent jerk and Frere realized that
Gabbett was below him Pressing with all the might of his muscles he
strove to resist the leverage which the giant was applying to turn him
over but he might as well have pushed against a stone wall With his
eyes protruding and every sinew strained to its uttermost he was
slowly forced round and he felt Gabbett releasing his grasp in order
to draw back and aim at him an effectual blow Disengaging his left
hand Frere suddenly allowed himself to sink and then drawing up his
right knee struck Gabbett beneath the jaw and as the huge head was
forced backwards by the blow dashed his fist into the brawny throat
The giant reeled backwards and falling on his hands and knees was in
an instant surrounded by sailors

Now began and ended in less time than it takes to write it one of
those Homeric struggles of one man against twenty which are none
the less heroic because the Ajax is a convict and the Trojans merely
ordinary sailors Shaking his assailants to the deck as easily as a
wild boar shakes off the dogs which clamber upon his bristly sides the
convict sprang to his feet and whirling the snatchedup cutlass round
his head kept the circle at bay Four times did the soldiers round the
hatchway raise their muskets and four times did the fear of wounding
the men who had flung themselves upon the enraged giant compel them to
restrain their fire Gabbett his stubbly hair on end his bloodshot
eyes glaring with fury his great hand opening and shutting in air as
though it gasped for something to seize turned himself about from side
to sidenow here now there bellowing like a wounded bull His
coarse shirt rent from shoulder to flank exposed the play of his huge
muscles He was bleeding from a cut on his forehead and the blood
trickling down his face mingled with the foam on his lips and dropped
sluggishly on his hairy breast Each time that an assailant came within
reach of the swinging cutlass the ruffians form dilated with a fresh
access of passion At one moment bunched with clinging adversarieshis
arms legs and shoulders a hanging mass of human bodiesat the next
free desperate alone in the midst of his foes his hideous countenance
contorted with hate and rage the giant seemed less a man than a demon
or one of those monstrous and savage apes which haunt the solitudes
of the African forests Spurning the mob who had rushed in at him he
strode towards his risen adversary and aimed at him one final blow that
should put an end to his tyranny for ever A notion that Sarah Purfoy
had betrayed him and that the handsome soldier was the cause of
the betrayal had taken possession of his mind and his rage had
concentrated itself upon Maurice Frere The aspect of the villain was so
appalling that despite his natural courage Frere seeing the backward
sweep of the cutlass absolutely closed his eyes with terror and
surrendered himself to his fate

As Gabbett balanced himself for the blow the ship which had been
rocking gently on a dull and silent sea suddenly lurchedthe convict
lost his balance swayed and fell Ere he could rise he was pinioned by
twenty hands

Authority was almost instantaneously triumphant on the upper and lower
decks The mutiny was over




CHAPTER XI DISCOVERIES AND CONFESSIONS



The shock was felt all through the vessel and Pine who had been
watching the ironing of the last of the mutineers at once divined its
cause

Thank God he cried theres a breeze at last and as the
overpowered Gabbett bruised bleeding and bound was dragged down the
hatchway the triumphant doctor hurried upon deck to find the
Malabar plunging through the whitening water under the influence of a
fifteenknot breeze

Stand by to reef topsails Away aloft men and furl the royals cries
Best from the quarterdeck and in the midst of the cheery confusion
Maurice Frere briefly recapitulated what had taken place taking
care however to pass over his own dereliction of duty as rapidly as
possible

Pine knit his brows Do you think that she was in the plot he asked

Not she says Frereeager to avert inquiry How should she be Plot
Shes sickening of fever or Im much mistaken

Sure enough on opening the door of the cabin they found Sarah Purfoy
lying where she had fallen a quarter of an hour before The clashing of
cutlasses and the firing of muskets had not roused her

We must make a sickbay somewhere says Pine looking at the senseless
figure with no kindly glance though I dont think shes likely to be
very bad Confound her I believe that shes the cause of all this Ill
find out too before many hours are over for Ive told those fellows
that unless they confess all about it before tomorrow morning Ill get
them six dozen apiece the day after we anchor in Hobart Town Ive a
great mind to do it before we get there Take her head Frere and well
get her out of this before Vickers comes up What a fool you are to be
sure I knew what it would be with women aboard ship I wonder Mrs V
hasnt been out before now Theresteady past the door Why man one
would think you never had your arm round a girls waist before Pooh
dont look so scaredI wont tell Make haste now before that little
parson comes Parsons are regular old women to chatter and thus
muttering Pine assisted to carry Mrs Vickerss maid into her cabin

By George but shes a fine girl he said viewing the inanimate body
with the professional eye of a surgeon I dont wonder at you making
a fool of yourself Chances are youve caught the fever though this
breeze will help to blow it out of us please God That old jackass
Blunt toohe ought to be ashamed of himself at his age

What do you mean asked Frere hastily as he heard a step approach
What has Blunt to say about her

Oh I dont know returned Pine He was smitten too thats all Like
a good many more in fact

A good many more repeated the other with a pretence of carelessness

Yes laughed Pine Why man she was making eyes at every man in the
ship I caught her kissing a soldier once

Maurice Freres cheeks grew hot The experienced profligate had been
taken in deceived perhaps laughed at All the time he had flattered
himself that he was fascinating the blackeyed maid the blackeyed
maid had been twisting him round her finger and perhaps imitating his
lovemaking for the gratification of her soldierlover It was not a
pleasant thought and yet strange to say the idea of Sarahs treachery
did not make him dislike her There is a sort of loveif love it can be
calledwhich thrives under illtreatment Nevertheless he cursed with
some appearance of disgust

Vickers met them at the door Pine Blunt has the fever Mr Best found
him in his cabin groaning Come and look at him

The commander of the Malabar was lying on his bunk in the betwisted
condition into which men who sleep in their clothes contrive to get
themselves The doctor shook him bent down over him and then loosened
his collar Hes not sick he said hes drunk Blunt wake up
Blunt

But the mass refused to move

Hallo says Pine smelling at the broken tumbler whats this Smells
queer Rum No Eh Laudanum By George hes been hocussed

Nonsense

I see it slapping his thigh Its that infernal woman Shes
drugged him and meant to do the same forFrere gave him an imploring
lookfor anybody else who would be fool enough to let her do it
Dawes was right sir Shes in it Ill swear shes in it

What my wifes maid Nonsense said Vickers

Nonsense echoed Frere

Its no nonsense That soldier who was shot whats his nameMiles
hebut however it doesnt matter Its all over now The men will
confess before morning says Vickers and well see And he went off
to his wifes cabin

His wife opened the door for him She had been sitting by the childs
bedside listening to the firing and waiting for her husbands return
without a murmur Flirt fribble and shrew as she was Julia Vickers
had displayed in times of emergency that glowing courage which women
of her nature at times possess Though she would yawn over any book
above the level of a genteel love story attempt to fascinate with
ludicrous assumption of girlishness boys young enough to be her sons
shudder at a frog and scream at a spider she could sit throughout a
quarter of an hour of such suspense as she had just undergone with as
much courage as if she had been the strongestminded woman that ever
denied her sex Is it all over she asked

Yes thank God said Vickers pausing on the threshold All is safe
now though we had a narrow escape I believe Hows Sylvia The child
was lying on the bed with her fair hair scattered over the pillow and
her tiny hands moving restlessly to and fro

A little better I think though she has been talking a good deal

The red lips parted and the blue eyes brighter than ever stared
vacantly around The sound of her fathers voice seemed to have roused
her for she began to speak a little prayer God bless papa and mamma
and God bless all on board this ship God bless me and make me a good
girl for Jesus Christs sake our Lord Amen

The sound of the unconscious childs simple prayer had something awesome
in it and John Vickers who not ten minutes before would have sealed
his own death warrant unhesitatingly to preserve the safety of the
vessel felt his eyes fill with unwonted tears The contrast was
curious From out the midst of that desolate oceanin a feversmitten
prison ship leagues from land surrounded by ruffians thieves and
murderers the baby voice of an innocent child called confidently on
Heaven


     


Two hours afterwardsas the Malabar escaped from the peril which had
menaced her plunged cheerily through the rippling waterthe mutineers
by the spokesman Mr James Vetch confessed

They were very sorry and hoped that their breach of discipline would
be forgiven It was the fear of the typhus which had driven them to it
They had no accomplices either in the prison or out of it but they felt
it but right to say that the man who had planned the mutiny was Rufus
Dawes

The malignant cripple had guessed from whom the information which
had led to the failure of the plot had been derived and this was his
characteristic revenge




CHAPTER XII A NEWSPAPER PARAGRAPH



Extracted from the Hobart Town Courier of the 12th November 1827

The examination of the prisoners who were concerned in the attempt upon
the Malabar was concluded on Tuesday last The four ringleaders Dawes
Gabbett Vetch and Sanders were condemned to death but we understand
that by the clemency of his Excellency the Governor their sentence
has been commuted to six years at the penal settlement of Macquarie
Harbour

CHAPTER I THE TOPOGRAPHY OF VAN DIEMENS LAND



The southeast coast of Van Diemens Land from the solitary Mewstone to
the basaltic cliffs of Tasmans Head from Tasmans Head to Cape Pillar
and from Cape Pillar to the rugged grandeur of Pirates Bay resembles
a biscuit at which rats have been nibbling Eaten away by the continual
action of the ocean which pouring round by east and west has divided
the peninsula from the mainland of the Australasian continentand done
for Van Diemens Land what it has done for the Isle of Wightthe shore
line is broken and ragged Viewed upon the map the fantastic fragments
of island and promontory which lie scattered between the SouthWest Cape
and the greater Swan Port are like the curious forms assumed by melted
lead spilt into water If the supposition were not too extravagant one
might imagine that when the Australian continent was fused a careless
giant upset the crucible and spilt Van Diemens land in the ocean The
coast navigation is as dangerous as that of the Mediterranean Passing
from Cape Bougainville to the east of Maria Island and between the
numerous rocks and shoals which lie beneath the triple height of the
Three Thumbs the mariner is suddenly checked by Tasmans Peninsula
hanging like a huge doubledropped earring from the mainland Getting
round under the Pillar rock through Storm Bay to Storing Island we
sight the Italy of this miniature Adriatic Between Hobart Town
and Sorrell Pittwater and the Derwent a strangelyshaped point of
landthe Italian boot with its toe bent upwardsprojects into the bay
and separated from this projection by a narrow channel dotted with
rocks the long length of Bruny Island makes between its western
side and the cliffs of Mount Royal the dangerous passage known as
DEntrecasteaux Channel At the southern entrance of DEntrecasteaux
Channel a line of sunken rocks known by the generic name of the
Actaeon reef attests that Bruny Head was once joined with the shores
of Recherche Bay while from the South Cape to the jaws of Macquarie
Harbour the white water caused by sunken reefs or the jagged peaks of
single rocks abruptly rising in mid sea warn the mariner off shore

It would seem as though nature jealous of the beauties of her silver
Derwent had made the approach to it as dangerous as possible but
once through the archipelago of DEntrecasteaux Channel or the less
dangerous eastern passage of Storm Bay the voyage up the river is
delightful From the sentinel solitude of the Iron Pot to the smiling
banks of New Norfolk the river winds in a succession of reaches
narrowing to a deep channel cleft between rugged and towering cliffs A
line drawn due north from the source of the Derwent would strike another
river winding out from the northern part of the island as the Derwent
winds out from the south The force of the waves expended perhaps in
destroying the isthmus which two thousand years ago probably connected
Van Diemens Land with the continent has been here less violent The
rounding currents of the Southern Ocean meeting at the mouth of the
Tamar have rushed upwards over the isthmus they have devoured and
pouring against the south coast of Victoria have excavated there that
inland sea called Port Philip Bay If the waves have gnawed the south
coast of Van Diemens Land they have bitten a mouthful out of the south
coast of Victoria The Bay is a millpool having an area of nine hundred
square miles with a race between the heads two miles across

About a hundred and seventy miles to the south of this millrace lies
Van Diemens Land fertile fair and rich rained upon by the genial
showers from the clouds which attracted by the Frenchmans Cap Wylds
Crag or the lofty peaks of the Wellington and Dromedary range pour
down upon the sheltered valleys their fertilizing streams No parching
hot windthe scavenger if the torment of the continentblows upon
her crops and corn The cool south breeze ripples gently the blue waters
of the Derwent and fans the curtains of the open windows of the city
which nestles in the broad shadow of Mount Wellington The hot wind
born amid the burning sand of the interior of the vast Australian
continent sweeps over the scorched and cracking plains to lick up
their streams and wither the herbage in its path until it meets the
waters of the great south bay but in its passage across the straits it
is reft of its fire and sinks exhausted with its journey at the feet
of the terraced slopes of Launceston

The climate of Van Diemens Land is one of the loveliest in the world
Launceston is warm sheltered and moist and Hobart Town protected by
Bruny Island and its archipelago of DEntrecasteaux Channel and Storm
Bay from the violence of the southern breakers preserves the mean
temperature of Smyrna whilst the district between these two towns
spreads in a succession of beautiful valleys through which glide clear
and sparkling streams But on the western coast from the steeplerocks
of Cape Grim to the scrubencircled barrenness of Sandy Cape and
the frowning entrance to Macquarie Harbour the nature of the country
entirely changes Along that ironbound shore from Pyramid Island and
the forestbacked solitude of Rocky Point to the great Ram Head and
the straggling harbour of Port Davey all is bleak and cheerless Upon
that dreary beach the rollers of the southern sea complete their circuit
of the globe and the storm that has devastated the Cape and united in
its eastern course with the icy blasts which sweep northward from the
unknown terrors of the southern pole crashes unchecked upon the Huon
pine forests and lashes with rain the grim front of Mount Direction
Furious gales and sudden tempests affright the natives of the coast
Navigation is dangerous and the entrance to the Hells Gates of
Macquarie Harbourat the time of which we are writing 1833 in the
height of its illfame as a convict settlementis only to be attempted
in calm weather The sealine is marked with wrecks The sunken rocks
are dismally named after the vessels they have destroyed The air is
chill and moist the soil prolific only in prickly undergrowth and
noxious weeds while foetid exhalations from swamp and fen cling close
to the humid spongy ground All around breathes desolation on the face
of nature is stamped a perpetual frown The shipwrecked sailor crawling
painfully to the summit of basalt cliffs or the ironed convict
dragging his tree trunk to the edge of some beetling plateau looks down
upon a sea of fog through which rise mountaintops like islands or
sees through the biting sleet a desert of scrub and crag rolling to the
feet of Mount Heemskirk and Mount Zeehancrouched like two sentinel
lions keeping watch over the seaboard




CHAPTER II THE SOLITARY OF HELLS GATES



Hells Gates formed by a rocky point which runs abruptly northward
almost touches on its eastern side a projecting arm of land which
guards the entrance to Kings River In the middle of the gates is a
natural boltthat is to say an islandwhich lying on a sandy bar in
the very jaws of the current creates a double whirlpool impossible
to pass in the smoothest weather Once through the gates the convict
chained on the deck of the inwardbound vessel sees in front of him the
bald cone of the Frenchmans Cap piercing the moist air at a height of
five thousand feet while gloomed by overhanging rocks and shadowed
by gigantic forests the black sides of the basin narrow to the mouth of
the Gordon The turbulent stream is the colour of indigo and being fed
by numerous rivulets which ooze through masses of decaying vegetable
matter is of so poisonous a nature that it is not only undrinkable but
absolutely kills the fish which in stormy weather are driven in from
the sea As may be imagined the furious tempests which beat upon this
exposed coast create a strong surfline After a few days of northwest
wind the waters of the Gordon will be found salt for twelve miles up
from the bar The headquarters of the settlement were placed on an
island not far from the mouth of this inhospitable river called Sarah
Island

Though now the whole place is desolate and a few rotting posts and logs
alone remainmute witnesses of scenes of agony never to be revivedin
the year 1833 the buildings were numerous and extensive On Philips
Island on the north side of the harbour was a small farm where
vegetables were grown for the use of the officers of the establishment
and on Sarah Island were sawpits forges dockyards gaol
guardhouse barracks and jetty The military force numbered about
sixty men who with convictwarders and constables took charge of
more than three hundred and fifty prisoners These miserable wretches
deprived of every hope were employed in the most degrading labour
No beast of burden was allowed on the settlement all the pulling and
dragging was done by human beings About one hundred goodconduct men
were allowed the lighter toil of dragging timber to the wharf to
assist in shipbuilding the others cut down the trees that fringed the
mainland and carried them on their shoulders to the waters edge The
denseness of the scrub and bush rendered it necessary for a roadway
perhaps a quarter of a mile in length to be first constructed and the
trunks of trees stripped of their branches were rolled together in
this roadway until a slide was made down which the heavier logs
could be shunted towards the harbour The timber thus obtained was made
into rafts and floated to the sheds or arranged for transportation
to Hobart Town The convicts were lodged on Sarah Island in barracks
flanked by a twostoried prison whose cells were the terror of the
most hardened Each morning they received their breakfast of porridge
water and salt and then rowed under the protection of their guard to
the woodcutting stations where they worked without food until night
The launching and hewing of the timber compelled them to work up to
their waists in water Many of them were heavily ironed Those who died
were buried on a little plot of ground called Hallidays Island from
the name of the first man buried there and a plank stuck into the
earth and carved with the initials of the deceased was the only
monument vouchsafed him

Sarah Island situated at the southeast corner of the harbour is long
and low The commandants house was built in the centre having the
chaplains house and barracks between it and the gaol The hospital was
on the west shore and in a line with it lay the two penitentiaries
Lines of lofty palisades ran round the settlement giving it the
appearance of a fortified town These palisades were built for the
purpose of warding off the terrific blasts of wind which shrieking
through the long and narrow bay as through the keyhole of a door had in
former times tore off roofs and levelled boatsheds The little town
was set as it were in defiance of Nature at the very extreme of
civilization and its inhabitants maintained perpetual warfare with the
winds and waves

But the gaol of Sarah Island was not the only prison in this desolate
region

At a little distance from the mainland is a rock over the rude side
of which the waves dash in rough weather On the evening of the 3rd
December 1833 as the sun was sinking behind the treetops on the left
side of the harbour the figure of a man appeared on the top of this
rock He was clad in the coarse garb of a convict and wore round his
ankles two iron rings connected by a short and heavy chain To the
middle of this chain a leathern strap was attached which splitting
in the form of a T buckled round his waist and pulled the chain high
enough to prevent him from stumbling over it as he walked His head was
bare and his coarse bluestriped shirt open at the throat displayed
an embrowned and muscular neck Emerging from out a sort of cell or
den contrived by nature or art in the side of the cliff he threw on
a scanty fire which burned between two hollowed rocks a small log of
pine wood and then returning to his cave and bringing from it an iron
pot which contained water he scooped with his toilhardened hands a
restingplace for it in the ashes and placed it on the embers It was
evident that the cave was at once his storehouse and larder and that
the two hollowed rocks formed his kitchen

Having thus made preparations for supper he ascended a pathway which
led to the highest point of the rock His fetters compelled him to take
short steps and as he walked he winced as though the iron bit him
A handkerchief or strip of cloth was twisted round his left ankle on
which the circlet had chafed a sore Painfully and slowly he gained his
destination and flinging himself on the ground gazed around him The
afternoon had been stormy and the rays of the setting sun shone redly
on the turbid and rushing waters of the bay On the right lay Sarah
Island on the left the bleak shore of the opposite and the tall peak of
the Frenchmans Cap while the storm hung sullenly over the barren hills
to the eastward Below him appeared the only sign of life A brig was
being towed up the harbour by two convictmanned boats

The sight of this brig seemed to rouse in the mind of the solitary of
the rock a strain of reflection for sinking his chin upon his hand
he fixed his eyes on the incoming vessel and immersed himself in moody
thought More than an hour had passed yet he did not move The ship
anchored the boats detached themselves from her sides the sun sank
and the bay was plunged in gloom Lights began to twinkle along the
shore of the settlement The little fire died and the water in the iron
pot grew cold yet the watcher on the rock did not stir With his eyes
staring into the gloom and fixed steadily on the vessel he lay along
the barren cliff of his lonely prison as motionless as the rock on which
he had stretched himself

This solitary man was Rufus Dawes




CHAPTER III A SOCIAL EVENING



In the house of Major Vickers Commandant of Macquarie Harbour there
was on this evening of December 3rd unusual gaiety

Lieutenant Maurice Frere late in command at Maria Island had
unexpectedly come down with news from headquarters The Ladybird
Government schooner visited the settlement on ordinary occasions twice
a year and such visits were looked forward to with no little eagerness
by the settlers To the convicts the arrival of the Ladybird meant
arrival of new faces intelligence of old comrades news of how the
world from which they were exiled was progressing When the Ladybird
arrived the chained and toilworn felons felt that they were yet human
that the universe was not bounded by the gloomy forests which surrounded
their prison but that there was a world beyond where men like
themselves smoked and drank and laughed and rested and were Free
When the Ladybird arrived they heard such news as interested themthat
is to say not mere foolish accounts of wars or ship arrivals or city
gossip but matters appertaining to their own worldhow Tom was with
the road gangs Dick on a ticketofleave Harry taken to the bush and
Jack hung at the Hobart Town Gaol Such items of intelligence were the
only news they cared to hear and the newcomers were well posted up in
such matters To the convicts the Ladybird was town talk theatre
stock quotations and latest telegrams She was their newspaper and
postoffice the one excitement of their dreary existence the one link
between their own misery and the happiness of their fellowcreatures To
the Commandant and the free men this messenger from the outer life
was scarcely less welcome There was not a man on the island who did not
feel his heart grow heavier when her white sails disappeared behind the
shoulder of the hill

On the present occasion business of more than ordinary importance had
procured for Major Vickers this pleasurable excitement It had been
resolved by Governor Arthur that the convict establishment should be
broken up A succession of murders and attempted escapes had called
public attention to the place and its distance from Hobart Town
rendered it inconvenient and expensive Arthur had fixed upon Tasmans
Peninsulathe earring of which we have spokenas a future convict
depot and naming it Port Arthur in honour of himself had sent down
Lieutenant Maurice Frere with instructions for Vickers to convey the
prisoners of Macquarie Harbour thither

In order to understand the magnitude and meaning of such an order as
that with which Lieutenant Frere was entrusted we must glance at the
social condition of the penal colony at this period of its history

Nine years before Colonel Arthur late Governor of Honduras had
arrived at a most critical moment The former Governor Colonel Sorrell
was a man of genial temperament but little strength of character He
was moreover profligate in his private life and encouraged by his
example his officers violated all rules of social decency It was
common for an officer to openly keep a female convict as his mistress
Not only would compliance purchase comforts but strange stories were
afloat concerning the persecution of women who dared to choose their own
lovers To put down this profligacy was the first care of Arthur and in
enforcing a severe attention to etiquette and outward respectability he
perhaps erred on the side of virtue Honest brave and highminded
he was also penurious and cold and the ostentatious good humour of
the colonists dashed itself in vain against his polite indifference In
opposition to this official society created by Governor Arthur was that
of the free settlers and the ticketofleave men The latter were more
numerous than one would be apt to suppose On the 2nd November 1829
thirtyeight free pardons and fiftysix conditional pardons appeared on
the books and the number of persons holding ticketsofleave on the
26th of September the same year was seven hundred and fortyfive

Of the social condition of these people at this time it is impossible to
speak without astonishment According to the recorded testimony of many
respectable personsGovernment officials military officers and free
settlersthe profligacy of the settlers was notorious Drunkenness was
a prevailing vice Even children were to be seen in the streets
intoxicated On Sundays men and women might be observed standing round
the publichouse doors waiting for the expiration of the hours of
public worship in order to continue their carousing As for the
condition of the prisoner population that indeed is indescribable
Notwithstanding the severe punishment for sly grogselling it was
carried on to a large extent Men and women were found intoxicated
together and a bottle of brandy was considered to be cheaply bought at
the price of twenty lashes In the factorya prison for femalesthe
vilest abuses were committed while the infamies current as matters
of course in chain gangs and penal settlements were of too horrible
a nature to be more than hinted at here All that the vilest and most
bestial of human creatures could invent and practise was in this
unhappy country invented and practised without restraint and without
shame

Seven classes of criminals were established in 1826 when the new
barracks for prisoners at Hobart Town were finished The first class
were allowed to sleep out of barracks and to work for themselves on
Saturday the second had only the lastnamed indulgence the third were
only allowed Saturday afternoon the fourth and fifth were refractory
and disorderly charactersto work in irons the sixth were men of
the most degraded and incorrigible characterto be worked in irons and
kept entirely separate from the other prisoners while the seventh were
the refuse of this refusethe murderers bandits and villains whom
neither chain nor lash could tame They were regarded as socially dead
and shipped to Hells Gates or Maria Island Hells Gates was the most
dreaded of all these houses of bondage The discipline at the place was
so severe and the life so terrible that prisoners would risk all to
escape from it In one year of eightyfive deaths there only thirty
were from natural causes of the remaining dead twentyseven were
drowned eight killed accidentally three shot by the soldiers and
twelve murdered by their comrades In 1822 one hundred and sixtynine
men out of one hundred and eightytwo were punished to the extent of two
thousand lashes During the ten years of its existence one hundred
and twelve men escaped out of whom sixtytwo only were founddead
The prisoners killed themselves to avoid living any longer and if so
fortunate as to penetrate the desert of scrub heath and swamp which
lay between their prison and the settled districts preferred death to
recapture Successfully to transport the remnant of this desperate band
of doublyconvicted felons to Arthurs new prison was the mission of
Maurice Frere

He was sitting by the empty fireplace with one leg carelessly thrown
over the other entertaining the company with his usual indifferent air
The six years that had passed since his departure from England had given
him a sturdier frame and a fuller face His hair was coarser his face
redder and his eye more hard but in demeanour he was little changed
Sobered he might be and his voice had acquired that decisive insured
tone which a voice exercised only in accents of command invariably
acquires but his bad qualities were as prominent as ever His five
years residence at Maria Island had increased that brutality of
thought and overbearing confidence in his own importance for which he
had been always remarkable but it had also given him an assured air of
authority which covered the more unpleasant features of his character
He was detested by the prisonersas he said it was a word and a blow
with himbut among his superiors he passed for an officer honest
and painstaking though somewhat bluff and severe

Well Mrs Vickers he said as he took a cup of tea from the hands
of that lady I suppose you wont be sorry to get away from this place
eh Trouble you for the toast Vickers

No indeed says poor Mrs Vickers with the old girlishness shadowed
by six years I shall be only too glad A dreadful place Johns
duties however are imperative But the wind My dear Mr Frere youve
no idea of it I wanted to send Sylvia to Hobart Town but John would
not let her go

By the way how is Miss Sylvia asked Frere with the patronising air
which men of his stamp adopt when they speak of children

Not very well Im sorry to say returned Vickers You see its
lonely for her here There are no children of her own age with the
exception of the pilots little girl and she cannot associate with her
But I did not like to leave her behind and endeavoured to teach her
myself

Hum There was ahagoverness or something was there not said
Frere staring into his teacup That maid you knowwhat was her
name

Miss Purfoy said Mrs Vickers a little gravely Yes poor thing A
sad story Mr Frere

Freres eye twinkled

Indeed I left you know shortly after the trial of the mutineers and
never heard the full particulars He spoke carelessly but he awaited
the reply with keen curiosity

A sad story repeated Mrs Vickers She was the wife of that wretched
man Rex and came out as my maid in order to be near him She would
never tell me her history poor thing though all through the dreadful
accusations made by that horrid doctorI always disliked that manI
begged her almost on my knees You know how she nursed Sylvia and poor
John Really a most superior creature I think she must have been a
governess

Mr Frere raised his eyebrows abruptly as though he would say
Governess Of course Happy suggestion Wonder it never occurred to
me before However her conduct was most exemplaryreally most
exemplaryand during the six months we were in Hobart Town she taught
little Sylvia a great deal Of course she could not help her wretched
husband you know Could she

Certainly not said Frere heartily I heard something about him too
Got into some scrape did he not Half a cup please

Miss Purfoy or Mrs Rex as she really was though I dont suppose Rex
is her real name eithersugar and milk I think you saidcame into
a little legacy from an old aunt in England Mr Frere gave a little
bluff nod meaning thereby Old aunt Exactly Just what might have been
expected And left my service She took a little cottage on the New
Town road and Rex was assigned to her as her servant

I see The old dodge says Frere flushing a little Well

Well the wretched man tried to escape and she helped him He was to
get to Launceston and so on board a vessel to Sydney but they took the
unhappy creature and he was sent down here She was only fined but it
ruined her

Ruined her

Well you see only a few people knew of her relationship to Rex and
she was rather respected Of course when it became known what with
that dreadful trial and the horrible assertions of Dr Pineyou will
not believe me I know there was something about that man I never
likedshe was quite left alone She wanted me to bring her down here to
teach Sylvia but John thought that it was only to be near her husband
and wouldnt allow it

Of course it was said Vickers rising Frere if youd like to
smoke well go on the verandahShe will never be satisfied until she
gets that scoundrel free

Hes a bad lot then says Frere opening the glass window and
leading the way to the sandy garden You will excuse my roughness Mrs
Vickers but I have become quite a slave to my pipe Ha ha its wife
and child to me

Oh a very bad lot returned Vickers quiet and silent but ready
for any villainy I count him one of the worst men we have With the
exception of one or two more I think he is the worst

Why dont you flog em says Frere lighting his pipe in the gloom
By George sir I cut the hides off my fellows if they show any
nonsense

Well says Vickers I dont care about too much cat myself Barton
who was here before me flogged tremendously but I dont think it
did any good They tried to kill him several times You remember those
twelve fellows who were hung No Ah of course you were away

What do you do with em

Oh flog the worst you know but I dont flog more than a man a week
as a rule and never more than fifty lashes Theyre getting quieter
now Then we iron and dumbcells and maroon them

Do what

Give them solitary confinement on Grummet Island When a man gets very
bad we clap him into a boat with a weeks provisions and pull him over
to Grummet There are cells cut in the rock you see and the fellow
pulls up his commissariat after him and lives there by himself for a
month or so It tames them wonderfully

Does it said Frere By Jove its a capital notion I wish I had a
place of that sort at Maria

Ive a fellow there now says Vickers Dawes You remember him of
coursethe ringleader of the mutiny in the Malabar A dreadful ruffian
He was most violent the first year I was here Barton used to flog
a good deal and Dawes had a childish dread of the cat When I came
inwhen was itin 29 hed made a sort of petition to be sent back
to the settlement Said that he was innocent of the mutiny and that the
accusation against him was false

The old dodge said Frere again A match Thanks

Of course I couldnt let him go but I took him out of the chaingang
and put him on the Osprey You saw her in the dock as you came in He
worked for some time very well and then tried to bolt again

The old trick Ha ha dont I know it says Mr Frere emitting a
streak of smoke in the air expressive of preternatural wisdom

Well we caught him and gave him fifty Then he was sent to the
chaingang cutting timber Then we put him into the boats but
he quarrelled with the coxswain and then we took him back to the
timberrafts About six weeks ago he made another attempttogether with
Gabbett the man who nearly killed youbut his leg was chafed with the
irons and we took him Gabbett and three more however got away

Havent you found em asked Frere puffing at his pipe

No But theyll come to the same fate as the rest said Vickers with
a sort of dismal pride No man ever escaped from Macquarie Harbour

Frere laughed By the Lord said he it will be rather hard for em
if they dont come back before the end of the month eh

Oh said Vickers theyre sure to comeif they can come at all but
once lost in the scrub a man hasnt much chance for his life

When do you think you will be ready to move asked Frere

As soon as you wish I dont want to stop a moment longer than I can
help It is a terrible life this

Do you think so asked his companion in unaffected surprise I like
it Its dull certainly When I first went to Maria I was dreadfully
bored but one soon gets used to it There is a sort of satisfaction
to me by George in keeping the scoundrels in order I like to see the
fellows eyes glint at you as you walk past em Gad theyd tear me to
pieces if they dared some of em and he laughed grimly as though
the hate he inspired was a thing to be proud of

How shall we go asked Vickers Have you got any instructions

No says Frere its all left to you Get em up the best way you
can Arthur said and pack em off to the new peninsula He thinks you
too far off here by George He wants to have you within hail

Its dangerous taking so many at once suggested Vickers

Not a bit Batten em down and keep the sentries awake and they wont
do any harm

But Mrs Vickers and the child

Ive thought of that You take the Ladybird with the prisoners and
leave me to bring up Mrs Vickers in the Osprey

We might do that Indeed its the best way I think I dont like the
notion of having Sylvia among those wretches and yet I dont like to
leave her

Well says Frere confident of his own ability to accomplish anything
he might undertake Ill take the Ladybird and you the Osprey Bring
up Mrs Vickers yourself

No no said Vickers with a touch of his old pomposity that wont
do By the Kings Regulations

All right interjected Frere you neednt quote em The officer
commanding is obliged to place himself in chargeall right my dear
sir Ive no objection in life

It was Sylvia that I was thinking of said Vickers

Well then cries the other as the door of the room inside opened
and a little white figure came through into the broad verandah Here
she is Ask her yourself Well Miss Sylvia will you come and shake
hands with an old friend

The brighthaired baby of the Malabar had become a brighthaired child
of some eleven years old and as she stood in her simple white dress in
the glow of the lamplight even the unaesthetic mind of Mr Frere was
struck by her extreme beauty Her bright blue eyes were as bright and as
blue as ever Her little figure was as upright and as supple as a willow
rod and her innocent delicate face was framed in a nimbus of that fine
golden hairdry and electrical each separate thread shining with a
lustre of its ownwith which the dreaming painters of the middle ages
endowed and glorified their angels

Come and give me a kiss Miss Sylvia cries Frere You havent
forgotten me have you

But the child resting one hand on her fathers knee surveyed Mr Frere
from head to foot with the charming impertinence of childhood and then
shaking her head inquired Who is he papa

Mr Frere darling Dont you remember Mr Frere who used to play ball
with you on board the ship and who was so kind to you when you were
getting well For shame Sylvia

There was in the chiding accents such an undertone of tenderness that
the reproof fell harmless

I remember you said Sylvia tossing her head but you were nicer
then than you are now I dont like you at all

You dont remember me said Frere a little disconcerted and
affecting to be intensely at his ease I am sure you dont What is my
name

Lieutenant Frere You knocked down a prisoner who picked up my ball I
dont like you

Youre a forward young lady upon my word said Frere with a great
laugh Ha ha so I did begad I recollect now What a memory youve
got

Hes here now isnt he papa went on Sylvia regardless of
interruption Rufus Dawes is his name and hes always in trouble Poor
fellow Im sorry for him Danny says hes queer in his mind

And whos Danny asked Frere with another laugh

The cook replied Vickers An old man I took out of hospital Sylvia
you talk too much with the prisoners I have forbidden you once or twice
before

But Danny is not a prisoner papahes a cook says Sylvia nothing
abashed and hes a clever man He told me all about London where the
Lord Mayor rides in a glass coach and all the work is done by free men
He says you never hear chains there I should like to see London papa

So would Mr Danny I have no doubt said Frere

Nohe didnt say that But he wants to see his old mother he says
Fancy Dannys mother What an ugly old woman she must be He says hell
see her in Heaven Will he papa

I hope so my dear

Papa

Yes

Will Danny wear his yellow jacket in Heaven or go as a free man

Frere burst into a roar at this

Youre an impertinent fellow sir cried Sylvia her bright eyes
flashing How dare you laugh at me If I was papa Id give you half an
hour at the triangles Oh you impertinent man and crimson with rage
the spoilt little beauty ran out of the room Vickers looked grave but
Frere was constrained to get up to laugh at his ease

Good Pon honour thats good The little vixenHalf an hour at the
triangles Haha ha ha ha

She is a strange child said Vickers and talks strangely for her
age but you mustnt mind her She is neither girl nor woman you see
and her education has been neglected Moreover this gloomy place and
its associationswhat can you expect from a child bred in a convict
settlement

My dear sir says the other shes delightful Her innocence of the
world is amazing

She must have three or four years at a good finishing school at Sydney
Please God I will give them to her when we go backor send her to
England if I can She is a goodhearted girl but she wants polishing
sadly Im afraid

Just then someone came up the garden path and saluted

What is it Troke

Prisoner given himself up sir

Which of them

Gabbett He came back tonight

Alone Yes sir The rest have diedhe says

Whats that asked Frere suddenly interested

The bolter I was telling you aboutGabbett your old friend Hes
returned

How long has he been out

Nigh six weeks sir said the constable touching his cap

Gad hes had a narrow squeak for it Ill be bound I should like to
see him

Hes down at the sheds said the ready Trokea good conduct
burglar You can see him at once gentlemen if you like

What do you say Vickers

Oh by all means




CHAPTER IV THE BOLTER



It was not far to the sheds and after a few minutes walk through the
wooden palisades they reached a long stone building two storeys high
from which issued a horrible growling pierced with shrilly screamed
songs At the sound of the musket butts clashing on the pinewood
flagging the noises ceased and a silence more sinister than sound fell
on the place

Passing between two rows of warders the two officers reached a sort of
anteroom to the gaol containing a pinelog stretcher on which a mass
of something was lying On a roughlymade stool by the side of this
stretcher sat a man in the grey dress worn as a contrast to the
yellow livery of good conduct prisoners This man held between his
knees a basin containing gruel and was apparently endeavouring to feed
the mass on the pine logs

Wont he eat Steve asked Vickers

And at the sound of the Commandants voice Steve arose

Dunno whats wrong wi un sir he said jerking up a finger to his
forehead He seems jest muggypated I cant do nothin wi un

Gabbett

The intelligent Troke considerately alive to the wishes of his superior
officers dragged the mass into a sitting posture

Gabbettfor it was hepassed one great hand over his face and leaning
exactly in the position in which Troke placed him scowled bewildered
at his visitors

Well Gabbett says Vickers youve come back again you see When
will you learn sense eh Where are your mates

The giant did not reply

Do you hear me Where are your mates

Where are your mates repeated Troke

Dead says Gabbett

All three of them

Ay

And how did you get back

Gabbett in eloquent silence held out a bleeding foot

We found him on the point sir said Troke jauntily explaining and
brought him across in the boat He had a basin of gruel but he didnt
seem hungry

Are you hungry

Yes

Why dont you eat your gruel

Gabbett curled his great lips

I have eaten it Aint yer got nuffin better nor that to flog a man
on Ugh yer a mean lot Wots it to be this time Major Fifty

And laughing he rolled down again on the logs

A nice specimen said Vickers with a hopeless smile What can one do
with such a fellow

Id flog his soul out of his body said Frere if he spoke to me like
that

Troke and the others hearing the statement conceived an instant
respect for the newcomer He looked as if he would keep his word

The giant raised his great head and looked at the speaker but did not
recognize him He saw only a strange facea visitor perhaps You
may flog and welcome master said he if youll give me a fig o
tibbacky Frere laughed The brutal indifference of the rejoinder
suited his humour and with a glance at Vickers he took a small piece
of cavendish from the pocket of his peajacket and gave it to the
recaptured convict Gabbett snatched it as a cur snatches at a bone and
thrust it whole into his mouth

How many mates had he asked Maurice watching the champing jaws
as one looks at a strange animal and asking the question as though a
mate was something a convict was born withlike a mole for instance

Three sir

Three eh Well give him thirty lashes Vickers

And if I ha had three more growled Gabbett mumbling at his tobacco
you wouldnt ha had the chance

What does he say

But Troke had not heard and the goodconduct man shrinking as it
seemed slightly from the prisoner said he had not heard either The
wretch himself munching hard at his tobacco relapsed into his restless
silence and was as though he had never spoken

As he sat there gloomily chewing he was a spectacle to shudder at Not
so much on account of his natural hideousness increased a thousandfold
by the tattered and filthy rags which barely covered him Not so much on
account of his unshaven jaws his harelip his torn and bleeding
feet his haggard cheeks and his huge wasted frame Not only because
looking at the animal as he crouched with one foot curled round the
other and one hairy arm pendant between his knees he was so horribly
unhuman that one shuddered to think that tender women and fair children
must of necessity confess to fellowship of kind with such a monster
But also because in his slavering mouth his slowly grinding jaws his
restless fingers and his bloodshot wandering eyes there lurked a hint
of some terror more awful than the terror of starvationa memory of a
tragedy played out in the gloomy depths of that forest which had vomited
him forth again and the shadow of this unknown horror clinging to him
repelled and disgusted as though he bore about with him the reek of the
shambles

Come said Vickers Let us go back I shall have to flog him again I
suppose Oh this place No wonder they call it Hells Gates

You are too softhearted my dear sir said Frere halfway up the
palisaded path We must treat brutes like brutes

Major Vickers inured as he was to such sentiments sighed It is
not for me to find fault with the system he said hesitating in
his reverence for discipline to utter all the thought but I have
sometimes wondered if kindness would not succeed better than the chain
and the cat

Your old ideas laughed his companion Remember they nearly cost
us our lives on the Malabar No no Ive seen something of
convictsthough to be sure my fellows were not so bad as yoursand
theres only one way Keep em down sir Make em feel what they are
Theyre there to work sir If they wont work flog em until they
will If they work wellwhy a taste of the cat now and then keeps em
in mind of what they may expect if they get lazy They had reached the
verandah now The rising moon shone softly on the bay beneath them and
touched with her white light the summit of the Grummet Rock

That is the general opinion I know returned Vickers But consider
the life they lead Good God he added with sudden vehemence as Frere
paused to look at the bay Im not a cruel man and never I believe
inflicted an unmerited punishment but since I have been here ten
prisoners have drowned themselves from yonder rock rather than live
on in their misery Only three weeks ago two men with a woodcutting
party in the hills having had some words with the overseer shook hands
with the gang and then hand in hand flung themselves over the cliff
Its horrible to think of

They shouldnt get sent here said practical Frere They knew what
they had to expect Serve em right

But imagine an innocent man condemned to this place

I cant said Frere with a laugh Innocent man be hanged Theyre
all innocent if youd believe their own stories Hallo whats that red
light there

Dawess fire on Grummet Rock says Vickers going in the man I told
you about Come in and have some brandyandwater and well shut the
door in place




CHAPTER V SYLVIA



Well said Frere as they went in youll be out of it soon You can
get all ready to start by the end of the month and Ill bring on Mrs
Vickers afterwards

What is that you say about me asked the sprightly Mrs Vickers from
within You wicked men leaving me alone all this time

Mr Frere has kindly offered to bring you and Sylvia after us in the
Osprey I shall of course have to take the Ladybird

You are most kind Mr Frere really you are says Mrs Vickers a
recollection of her flirtation with a certain young lieutenant six
years before tinging her cheeks It is really most considerate of
you Wont it be nice Sylvia to go with Mr Frere and mamma to Hobart
Town

Mr Frere says Sylvia coming from out a corner of the room I am
very sorry for what I said just now Will you forgive me

She asked the question in such a prim oldfashioned way standing in
front of him with her golden locks streaming over her shoulders and
her hands clasped on her black silk apron Julia Vickers had her own
notions about dressing her daughter that Frere was again inclined to
laugh

Of course Ill forgive you my dear he said You didnt mean it I
know

Oh but I did mean it and thats why Im sorry I am a very naughty
girl sometimes though you wouldnt think so this with a charming
consciousness of her own beauty especially with Roman history I
dont think the Romans were half as brave as the Carthaginians do you
Mr Frere

Maurice somewhat staggered by this question could only ask Why not

Well I dont like them half so well myself says Sylvia with
feminine disdain of reasons They always had so many soldiers though
the others were so cruel when they conquered

Were they says Frere

Were they Goodness gracious yes Didnt they cut poor Reguluss
eyelids off and roll him down hill in a barrel full of nails What do
you call that I should like to know and Mr Frere shaking his red
head with vast assumption of classical learning could not but concede
that that was not kind on the part of the Carthaginians

You are a great scholar Miss Sylvia he remarked with a
consciousness that this selfpossessed girl was rapidly taking him out
of his depth

Are you fond of reading

Very

And what books do you read

Oh lots Paul and Virginia and Paradise Lost and Shakespeares
Plays and Robinson Crusoe and Blairs Sermons and The Tasmanian
Almanack and The Book of Beauty and Tom Jones

A somewhat miscellaneous collection I fear said Mrs Vickers with a
sickly smileshe like Gallio cared for none of these thingsbut
our little library is necessarily limited and I am not a great reader
John my dear Mr Frere would like another glass of brandyandwater
Oh dont apologize I am a soldiers wife you know Sylvia my love
say goodnight to Mr Frere and retire

Goodnight Miss Sylvia Will you give me a kiss

No

Sylvia dont be rude

Im not rude cries Sylvia indignant at the way in which her literary
confidence had been received Hes rude I wont kiss you Kiss you
indeed My goodness gracious

Wont you you little beauty cried Frere suddenly leaning forward
and putting his arm round the child Then I must kiss you

To his astonishment Sylvia finding herself thus seized and kissed
despite herself flushed scarlet and lifting up her tiny fist struck
him on the cheek with all her force

The blow was so sudden and the momentary pain so sharp that Maurice
nearly slipped into his native coarseness and rapped out an oath

My dear Sylvia cried Vickers in tones of grave reproof

But Frere laughed caught both the childs hands in one of his own and
kissed her again and again despite her struggles There he said
with a sort of triumph in his tone You got nothing by that you see

Vickers rose with annoyance visible on his face to draw the child
away and as he did so she gasping for breath and sobbing with rage
wrenched her wrist free and in a storm of childish passion struck her
tormentor again and again Man she cried with flaming eyes Let me
go I hate you I hate you I hate you

I am very sorry for this Frere said Vickers when the door was
closed again I hope she did not hurt you

Not she I like her spirit Ha ha Thats the way with women all the
world over Nothing like showing them that theyve got a master

Vickers hastened to turn the conversation and amid recollections of
old days and speculations as to future prospects the little incident
was forgotten But when an hour later Mr Frere traversed the passage
that led to his bedroom he found himself confronted by a little figure
wrapped in a shawl It was his childish enemy

Ive waited for you Mr Frere said she to beg pardon I ought not
to have struck you I am a wicked girl Dont say no because I am and
if I dont grow better I shall never go to Heaven

Thus addressing him the child produced a piece of paper folded like a
letter from beneath the shawl and handed it to him

Whats this he asked Go back to bed my dear youll catch cold

Its a written apology and I shant catch cold because Ive got my
stockings on If you dont accept it she added with an arching of the
brows it is not my fault I have struck you but I apologize Being a
woman I cant offer you satisfaction in the usual way

Mr Frere stifled the impulse to laugh and made his courteous adversary
a low bow

I accept your apology Miss Sylvia said he

Then returned Miss Sylvia in a lofty manner there is nothing more
to be said and I have the honour to bid you goodnight sir

The little maiden drew her shawl close around her with immense dignity
and marched down the passage as calmly as though she had been Amadis of
Gaul himself

Frere gaining his room choking with laughter opened the folded paper
by the light of the tallow candle and read in a quaint childish
hand

SIRI have struck you I apologize in writing Your humble servant to
command SYLVIA VICKERS

I wonder what book she took that out of he said Pon my word she
must be a little cracked Gad its a queer life for a child in this
place and no mistake




CHAPTER VI A LEAP IN THE DARK



Two or three mornings after the arrival of the Ladybird the solitary
prisoner of the Grummet Rock noticed mysterious movements along the
shore of the island settlement The prison boats which had put off
every morning at sunrise to the foot of the timbered ranges on the other
side of the harbour had not appeared for some days The building of a
pier or breakwater running from the western point of the settlement
was discontinued and all hands appeared to be occupied with the
newlybuilt Osprey which was lying on the slips Parties of soldiers
also daily left the Ladybird and assisted at the mysterious work
in progress Rufus Dawes walking his little round each day in vain
wondered what this unusual commotion portended Unfortunately no one
came to enlighten his ignorance

A fortnight after this about the 15th of December he observed another
curious fact All the boats on the island put off one morning to the
opposite side of the harbour and in the course of the day a great smoke
arose along the side of the hills The next day the same was repeated
and on the fourth day the boats returned towing behind them a huge
raft This raft made fast to the side of the Ladybird proved to be
composed of planks beams and joists all of which were duly hoisted
up and stowed in the hold of the brig

This set Rufus Dawes thinking Could it possibly be that the
timbercutting was to be abandoned and that the Government had hit upon
some other method of utilizing its convict labour He had hewn timber
and built boats and tanned hides and made shoes Was it possible that
some new trade was to be initiated Before he had settled this point
to his satisfaction he was startled by another boat expedition Three
boats crews went down the bay and returned after a days absence
with an addition to their number in the shape of four strangers and a
quantity of stores and farming implements Rufus Dawes catching
sight of these last came to the conclusion that the boats had been to
Philips Island where the garden was established and had taken off
the gardeners and garden produce Rufus Dawes decided that the Ladybird
had brought a new commandanthis sight trained by his halfsavage
life had already distinguished Mr Maurice Frereand that these
mysteries were improvements under the new rule When he arrived at
this point of reasoning another conjecture assuming his first to have
been correct followed as a natural consequence Lieutenant Frere
would be a more severe commandant than Major Vickers Now severity had
already reached its height so far as he was concerned so the unhappy
man took a final resolutionhe would kill himself Before we exclaim
against the sin of such a determination let us endeavour to set before
us what the sinner had suffered during the past six years

We have already a notion of what life on a convict ship means and we
have seen through what a furnace Rufus Dawes had passed before he set
foot on the barren shore of Hells Gates But to appreciate in its
intensity the agony he suffered since that time we must multiply the
infamy of the tween decks of the Malabar a hundred fold In that prison
was at least some ray of light All were not abominable all were not
utterly lost to shame and manhood Stifling though the prison infamous
the companionship terrible the memory of past happinessthere was yet
ignorance of the future there was yet hope But at Macquarie Harbour
was poured out the very dregs of this cup of desolation The worst had
come and the worst must for ever remain The pit of torment was so deep
that one could not even see Heaven There was no hope there so long as
life remained Death alone kept the keys of that island prison

Is it possible to imagine even for a moment what an innocent man
gifted with ambition endowed with power to love and to respect must
have suffered during one week of such punishment We ordinary men
leading ordinary liveswalking riding laughing marrying and giving
in marriagecan form no notion of such misery as this Some dim ideas
we may have about the sweetness of liberty and the loathing that evil
company inspires but that is all We know that were we chained and
degraded fed like dogs employed as beasts of burden driven to our
daily toil with threats and blows and herded with wretches among whom
all that savours of decency and manliness is held in an open scorn we
should die perhaps or go mad But we do not know and can never know
how unutterably loathsome life must become when shared with such beings
as those who dragged the treetrunks to the banks of the Gordon and
toiled blaspheming in their irons on the dismal sandpit of Sarah
Island No human creature could describe to what depth of personal
abasement and selfloathing one week of such a life would plunge him
Even if he had the power to write he dared not As one whom in a
desert seeking for a face should come to a pool of blood and
seeing his own reflection flyso would such a one hasten from the
contemplation of his own degrading agony Imagine such torment endured
for six years

Ignorant that the sights and sounds about him were symptoms of the final
abandonment of the settlement and that the Ladybird was sent down to
bring away the prisoners Rufus Dawes decided upon getting rid of that
burden of life which pressed upon him so heavily For six years he had
hewn wood and drawn water for six years he had hoped against hope for
six years he had lived in the valley of the shadow of Death He dared
not recapitulate to himself what he had suffered Indeed his senses
were deadened and dulled by torture He cared to remember only one
thingthat he was a Prisoner for Life In vain had been his first dream
of freedom He had done his best by good conduct to win release
but the villainy of Vetch and Rex had deprived him of the fruit of his
labour Instead of gaining credit by his exposure of the plot on board
the Malabar he was himself deemed guilty and condemned despite his
asseverations of innocence The knowledge of his treacheryfor so it
was deemed among his associateswhile it gained for him no credit with
the authorities procured for him the detestation and illwill of the
monsters among whom he found himself On his arrival at Hells Gates he
was a marked mana Pariah among those beings who were Pariahs to all
the world beside Thrice his life was attempted but he was not then
quite tired of living and he defended it This defence was construed by
an overseer into a brawl and the irons from which he had been relieved
were replaced His strengthbrute attribute that alone could avail
himmade him respected after this and he was left at peace At first
this treatment was congenial to his temperament but by and by it became
annoying then painful then almost unendurable Tugging at his oar
digging up to his waist in slime or bending beneath his burden of pine
wood he looked greedily for some excuse to be addressed He would take
double weight when forming part of the human caterpillar along whose
back lay a pine tree for a word of fellowship He would work double
tides to gain a kindly sentence from a comrade In his utter desolation
he agonized for the friendship of robbers and murderers Then the
reaction came and he hated the very sound of their voices He never
spoke and refused to answer when spoken to He would even take
his scanty supper alone did his chain so permit him He gained the
reputation of a sullen dangerous halfcrazy ruffian Captain Barton
the superintendent took pity on him and made him his gardener He
accepted the pity for a week or so and then Barton coming down one
morning found the few shrubs pulled up by the roots the flowerbeds
trampled into barrenness and his gardener sitting on the ground among
the fragments of his gardening tools For this act of wanton mischief he
was flogged At the triangles his behaviour was considered curious
He wept and prayed to be released fell on his knees to Barton and
implored pardon Barton would not listen and at the first blow the
prisoner was silent From that time he became more sullen than ever
only at times he was observed when alone to fling himself on the
ground and cry like a child It was generally thought that his brain was
affected

When Vickers came Dawes sought an interview and begged to be sent back
to Hobart Town This was refused of course but he was put to work on
the Osprey After working there for some time and being released from
his irons he concealed himself on the slip and in the evening swam
across the harbour He was pursued retaken and flogged Then he ran
the dismal round of punishment He burnt lime dragged timber and
tugged at the oar The heaviest and most degrading tasks were always
his Shunned and hated by his companions feared by the convict
overseers and regarded with unfriendly eyes by the authorities Rufus
Dawes was at the very bottom of that abyss of woe into which he had
voluntarily cast himself Goaded to desperation by his own thoughts he
had joined with Gabbett and the unlucky three in their desperate
attempt to escape but as Vickers stated he had been captured
almost instantly He was lamed by the heavy irons he wore and
though Gabbettwith a strange eagerness for which after events
accountedinsisted that he could make good his flight the unhappy man
fell in the first hundred yards of the terrible race and was seized by
two volunteers before he could rise again His capture helped to secure
the brief freedom of his comrades for Mr Troke content with one
prisoner checked a pursuit which the nature of the ground rendered
dangerous and triumphantly brought Dawes back to the settlement as his
peaceoffering for the negligence which had resulted in the loss of the
other four For this madness the refractory convict had been condemned
to the solitude of the Grummet Rock

In that dismal hermitage his mind preying on itself had become
disordered He saw visions and dreamt dreams He would lie for hours
motionless staring at the sun or the sea He held converse with
imaginary beings He enacted the scene with his mother over again He
harangued the rocks and called upon the stones about him to witness his
innocence and his sacrifice He was visited by the phantoms of his early
friends and sometimes thought his present life a dream Whenever he
awoke however he was commanded by a voice within himself to leap into
the surges which washed the walls of his prison and to dream these sad
dreams no more

In the midst of this lethargy of body and brain the unusual occurrences
along the shore of the settlement roused in him a still fiercer hatred
of life He saw in them something incomprehensible and terrible and
read in them threats of an increase of misery Had he known that the
Ladybird was preparing for sea and that it had been already decided to
fetch him from the Rock and iron him with the rest for safe passage to
Hobart Town he might have paused but he knew nothing save that the
burden of life was insupportable and that the time had come for him to
be rid of it

In the meantime the settlement was in a fever of excitement In less
than three weeks from the announcement made by Vickers all had been got
ready The Commandant had finally arranged with Frere as to his course
of action He would himself accompany the Ladybird with the main body
His wife and daughter were to remain until the sailing of the Osprey
which Mr Frerecharged with the task of final destructionwas to
bring up as soon as possible I will leave you a corporals guard and
ten prisoners as a crew Vickers said You can work her easily
with that number To which Frere smiling at Mrs Vickers in a
selfsatisfied way had replied that he could do with five prisoners if
necessary for he knew how to get double work out of the lazy dogs

Among the incidents which took place during the breaking up was one
which it is necessary to chronicle Near Philips Island on the north
side of the harbour is situated Coal Head where a party had been
lately at work This party hastily withdrawn by Vickers to assist in
the business of devastation had left behind it some tools and timber
and at the eleventh hour a boats crew was sent to bring away the
debris The tools were duly collected and the pine logsworth
twentyfive shillings apiece in Hobart Townduly rafted and chained
The timber was secured and the convicts towing it after them
pulled for the ship just as the sun sank In the general relaxation of
discipline and haste the raft had not been made with as much care
as usual and the strong current against which the boat was labouring
assisted the negligence of the convicts The logs began to loosen and
although the onward motion of the boat kept the chain taut when the
rowers slackened their exertions the mass parted and Mr Troke hooking
himself on to the side of the Ladybird saw a huge log slip out from
its fellows and disappear into the darkness Gazing after it with
an indignant and disgusted stare as though it had been a refractory
prisoner who merited two days solitary he thought he heard a cry
from the direction in which it had been borne He would have paused
to listen but all his attention was needed to save the timber and to
prevent the boat from being swamped by the struggling mass at her stern

The cry had proceeded from Rufus Dawes From his solitary rock he had
watched the boat pass him and make for the Ladybird in the channel
and he had decidedwith that curious childishness into which the mind
relapses on such supreme occasionsthat the moment when the gathering
gloom swallowed her up should be the moment when he would plunge into
the surge below him The heavilylabouring boat grew dimmer and dimmer
as each tug of the oars took her farther from him Presently only the
figure of Mr Troke in the stern sheets was visible then that also
disappeared and as the nose of the timber raft rose on the swell of the
next wave Rufus Dawes flung himself into the sea

He was heavily ironed and he sank like a stone He had resolved not to
attempt to swim and for the first moment kept his arms raised above his
head in order to sink the quicker But as the short sharp agony of
suffocation caught him and the shock of the icy water dispelled the
mental intoxication under which he was labouring he desperately struck
out and despite the weight of his irons gained the surface for an
instant As he did so all bewildered and with the one savage instinct
of selfpreservation predominant over all other thoughts he became
conscious of a huge black mass surging upon him out of the darkness
An instants buffet with the current an ineffectual attempt to dive
beneath it a horrible sense that the weight at his feet was dragging
him downand the huge log loosened from the raft was upon him
crushing him beneath its rough and ragged sides All thoughts of
selfmurder vanished with the presence of actual peril and uttering
that despairing cry which had been faintly heard by Troke he flung up
his arms to clutch the monster that was pushing him down to death The
log passed completely over him thrusting him beneath the water but his
hand scraping along the splintered side came in contact with the loop
of hide rope that yet hung round the mass and clutched it with the
tenacity of a death grip In another instant he got his head above
water and making good his hold twisted himself by a violent effort
across the log

For a moment he saw the lights from the stern windows of the anchored
vessels low in the distance Grummet Rock disappeared on his left then
exhausted breathless and bruised he closed his eyes and the drifting
log bore him swiftly and silently away into the darkness


     


At daylight the next morning Mr Troke landing on the prison rock
found it deserted The prisoners cap was lying on the edge of the
little cliff but the prisoner himself had disappeared Pulling back to
the Ladybird the intelligent Troke pondered on the circumstance and in
delivering his report to Vickers mentioned the strange cry he had heard
the night before Its my belief sir that he was trying to swim the
bay he said He must ha gone to the bottom anyhow for he couldnt
swim five yards with them irons

Vickers busily engaged in getting under weigh accepted this very
natural supposition without question The prisoner had met his death
either by his own act or by accident It was either a suicide or an
attempt to escape and the former conduct of Rufus Dawes rendered the
latter explanation a more probable one In any case he was dead As Mr
Troke rightly surmised no man could swim the bay in irons and when
the Ladybird an hour later passed the Grummet Rock all on board her
believed that the corpse of its late occupant was lying beneath the
waves that seethed at its base




CHAPTER VII THE LAST OF MACQUARIE HARBOUR



Rufus Dawes was believed to be dead by the party on board the Ladybird
and his strange escape was unknown to those still at Sarah Island
Maurice Frere if he bestowed a thought upon the refractory prisoner of
the Rock believed him to be safely stowed in the hold of the schooner
and already halfway to Hobart Town while not one of the eighteen
persons on board the Osprey suspected that the boat which had put off
for the marooned man had returned without him Indeed the party had
little leisure for thought Mr Frere eager to prove his ability and
energy was making strenuous exertions to get away and kept his
unlucky ten so hard at work that within a week from the departure of
the Ladybird the Osprey was ready for sea Mrs Vickers and the child
having watched with some excusable regret the process of demolishing
their old home had settled down in their small cabin in the brig and
on the evening of the 11th of January Mr Bates the pilot who acted
as master informed the crew that Lieutenant Frere had given orders to
weigh anchor at daybreak

At daybreak accordingly the brig set sail with a light breeze from
the southwest and by three oclock in the afternoon anchored safely
outside the Gates Unfortunately the wind shifted to the northwest
which caused a heavy swell on the bar and prudent Mr Bates having
consideration for Mrs Vickers and the child ran back ten miles
into Wellington Bay and anchored there again at seven oclock in the
morning The tide was running strongly and the brig rolled a good deal
Mrs Vickers kept to her cabin and sent Sylvia to entertain Lieutenant
Frere Sylvia went but was not entertaining She had conceived for
Frere one of those violent antipathies which children sometimes own
without reason and since the memorable night of the apology had been
barely civil to him In vain did he pet her and compliment her she was
not to be flattered into liking him I do not like you sir she said
in her stilted fashion but that need make no difference to you You
occupy yourself with your prisoners I can amuse myself without you
thank you Oh all right said Frere I dont want to interfere
but he felt a little nettled nevertheless On this particular evening
the young lady relaxed her severity of demeanour Her father away and
her mother sick the little maiden felt lonely and as a last resource
accepted her mothers commands and went to Frere He was walking up and
down the deck smoking

Mr Frere I am sent to talk to you

Are you All rightgo on

Oh dear no It is the gentlemans place to entertain Be amusing

Come and sit down then said Frere who was in good humour at the
success of his arrangements What shall we talk about

You stupid man As if I knew It is your place to talk Tell me a fairy
story

Jack and the Beanstalk suggested Frere

Jack and the grandmother Nonsense Make one up out of your head you
know

Frere laughed

I cant he said I never did such a thing in my life

Then why not begin I shall go away if you dont begin

Frere rubbed his brows Well have you readhave you read Robinson
Crusoeas if the idea was a brilliant one

Of course I have returned Sylvia pouting Read ityes
Everybodys read Robinson Crusoe

Oh have they Well I didnt know let me see now And pulling hard
at his pipe he plunged into literary reflection

Sylvia sitting beside him eagerly watching for the happy thought that
never came pouted and said What a stupid stupid man you are I shall
be so glad to get back to papa again He knows all sorts of stories
nearly as many as old Danny

Danny knows some then

Dannywith as much surprise as if she said Walter Scott Of
course he does I suppose now putting her head on one side with an
amusing expression of superiority you never heard the story of the
Banshee

No I never did

Nor the White Horse of the Peppers

No

No I suppose not Nor the Changeling nor the Leprechaun No

Sylvia got off the skylight on which she had been sitting and surveyed
the smoking animal beside her with profound contempt

Mr Frere you are really a most ignorant person Excuse me if I hurt
your feelings I have no wish to do that but really you are a most
ignorant personfor your age of course

Maurice Frere grew a little angry You are very impertinent Sylvia
said he

Miss Vickers is my name Lieutenant Frere and I shall go and talk to
Mr Bates

Which threat she carried out on the spot and Mr Bates who had filled
the dangerous office of pilot told her about divers and coral reefs
and some adventures of hisa little apocryphalin the China Seas
Frere resumed his smoking half angry with himself and half angry with
the provoking little fairy This elfin creature had a fascination for
him which he could not account for

However he saw no more of her that evening and at breakfast the next
morning she received him with quaint haughtiness

When shall we be ready to sail Mr Frere Ill take some marmalade
Thank you

I dont know missy said Bates Its very rough on the Bar me and
Mr Frere was a soundin of it this marnin and it aint safe yet

Well said Sylvia I do hope and trust we shant be shipwrecked and
have to swim miles and miles for our lives

Ho ho laughed Frere dont be afraid Ill take care of you

Can you swim Mr Bates asked Sylvia

Yes miss I can

Well then you shall take me I like you Mr Frere can take mamma
Well go and live on a desert island Mr Bates wont we and grow
cocoanuts and breadfruit andwhat nasty hard biscuitsIll be
Robinson Crusoe and you shall be Man Friday Id like to live on a
desert island if I was sure there were no savages and plenty to eat
and drink

That would be right enough my dear but you dont find them sort of
islands every day

Then said Sylvia with a decided nod we wont be shipwrecked will
we

I hope not my dear

Put a biscuit in your pocket Sylvia in case of accidents suggested
Frere with a grin

Oh you know my opinion of you sir Dont speak I dont want any
argument

Dont youthats right

Mr Frere said Sylvia gravely pausing at her mothers cabin door
if I were Richard the Third do you know what I should do with you

No says Frere eating complacently what would you do

Why Id make you stand at the door of St Pauls Cathedral in a white
sheet with a lighted candle in your hand until you gave up your wicked
aggravating waysyou Man

The picture of Mr Frere in a white sheet with a lighted candle in his
hand at the door of St Pauls Cathedral was too much for Mr Batess
gravity and he roared with laughter Shes a queer child aint she
sir A born natural and a goodnatured little soul

When shall we be able to get away Mr Bates asked Frere whose
dignity was wounded by the mirth of the pilot

Bates felt the change of tone and hastened to accommodate himself to
his officers humour I hopes by evening sir said he if the tide
slackens then Ill risk it but its no use trying it now

The men were wanting to go ashore to wash their clothes said Frere

If we are to stop here till evening you had better let them go after
dinner

All right sir said Bates

The afternoon passed off auspiciously The ten prisoners went ashore and
washed their clothes Their names were James Barker James Lesly John
Lyon Benjamin Riley William Cheshire Henry Shiers William Russen
James Porter John Fair and John Rex This last scoundrel had come on
board latest of all He had behaved himself a little better recently
and during the work attendant upon the departure of the Ladybird had
been conspicuously useful His intelligence and influence among his
fellowprisoners combined to make him a somewhat important personage
and Vickers had allowed him privileges from which he had been hitherto
debarred Mr Frere however who superintended the shipment of some
stores seemed to be resolved to take advantage of Rexs evident
willingness to work He never ceased to hurry and find fault with him
He vowed that he was lazy sulky or impertinent It was Rex come
here Do this Do that As the prisoners declared among themselves it
was evident that Mr Frere had a down on the Dandy The day before
the Ladybird sailed Rexrejoicing in the hope of speedy departurehad
suffered himself to reply to some more than usually galling remark and
Mr Frere had complained to Vickers The fellows too ready to get
away said he Let him stop for the Osprey it will be a lesson to
him Vickers assented and John Rex was informed that he was not to
sail with the first party His comrades vowed that this order was an act
of tyranny but he himself said nothing He only redoubled his activity
anddespite all his wish to the contraryFrere was unable to find
fault He even took credit to himself for taming the convicts spirit
and pointed out Rexsilent and obedientas a proof of the excellence
of severe measures To the convicts however who knew John Rex better
this silent activity was ominous He returned with the rest however on
the evening of the 13th in apparently cheerful mood Indeed Mr Frere
who wearied by the delay had decided to take the whaleboat in which
the prisoners had returned and catch a few fish before dinner observed
him laughing with some of the others and again congratulated himself

The time wore on Darkness was closing in and Mr Bates walking the
deck kept a lookout for the boat with the intention of weighing
anchor and making for the Bar All was secure Mrs Vickers and the
child were safely below The two remaining soldiers two had gone with
Frere were upon deck and the prisoners in the forecastle were singing
The wind was fair and the sea had gone down In less than an hour the
Osprey would be safely outside the harbour




CHAPTER VIII THE POWER OF THE WILDERNESS



The drifting log that had so strangely served as a means of saving Rufus
Dawes swam with the current that was running out of the bay For some
time the burden that it bore was an insensible one Exhausted with his
desperate struggle for life the convict lay along the rough back of
this Heavensent raft without motion almost without breath At length a
violent shock awoke him to consciousness and he perceived that the log
had become stranded on a sandy point the extremity of which was lost in
darkness Painfully raising himself from his uncomfortable posture
he staggered to his feet and crawling a few paces up the beach flung
himself upon the ground and slept

When morning dawned he recognized his position The log had in passing
under the lee of Philips Island been cast upon the southern point of
Coal Head some three hundred yards from him were the mutilated sheds of
the coal gang For some time he lay still basking in the warm rays of
the rising sun and scarcely caring to move his bruised and shattered
limbs The sensation of rest was so exquisite that it overpowered all
other considerations and he did not even trouble himself to conjecture
the reason for the apparent desertion of the huts close by him If there
was no one therewell and good If the coal party had not gone he
would be discovered in a few moments and brought back to his island
prison In his exhaustion and misery he accepted the alternative and
slept again

As he laid down his aching head Mr Troke was reporting his death to
Vickers and while he still slept the Ladybird on her way out passed
him so closely that any one on board her might with a good glass have
espied his slumbering figure as it lay upon the sand

When he woke it was past midday and the sun poured its full rays upon
him His clothes were dry in all places save the side on which he had
been lying and he rose to his feet refreshed by his long sleep He
scarcely comprehended as yet his true position He had escaped it
was true but not for long He was versed in the history of escapes
and knew that a man alone on that barren coast was face to face with
starvation or recapture Glancing up at the sun he wondered indeed
how it was that he had been free so long Then the coal sheds caught his
eye and he understood that they were untenanted This astonished him
and he began to tremble with vague apprehension Entering he looked
around expecting every moment to see some lurking constable or armed
soldier Suddenly his glance fell upon the food rations which lay in the
corner where the departing convicts had flung them the night before
At such a moment this discovery seemed like a direct revelation from
Heaven He would not have been surprised had they disappeared Had he
lived in another age he would have looked round for the angel who had
brought them

By and by having eaten of this miraculous provender the poor creature
beganreckoning by his convict experienceto understand what had taken
place The coal workings were abandoned the new Commandant had probably
other work for his beasts of burden to execute and an absconder would
be safe here for a few hours at least But he must not stay For him
there was no rest If he thought to escape it behoved him to commence
his journey at once As he contemplated the meat and bread something
like a ray of hope entered his gloomy soul Here was provision for his
needs The food before him represented the rations of six men Was it
not possible to cross the desert that lay between him and freedom on
such fare The very supposition made his heart beat faster It surely
was possible He must husband his resources walk much and eat little
spread out the food for one day into the food for three Here was six
mens food for one day or one mans food for six days He would live on
a third of this and he would have rations for eighteen days Eighteen
days What could he not do in eighteen days He could walk thirty miles
a dayforty miles a daythat would be six hundred miles and more Yet
stay he must not be too sanguine the road was difficult the scrub was
in places impenetrable He would have to make detours and turn upon
his tracks to waste precious time He would be moderate and say twenty
miles a day Twenty miles a day was very easy walking Taking a piece
of stick from the ground he made the calculation in the sand Eighteen
days and twenty miles a daythree hundred and sixty miles More than
enough to take him to freedom It could be done With prudence it could
be done He must be careful and abstemious Abstemious He had already
eaten too much and he hastily pulled a barelytasted piece of meat from
his mouth and replaced it with the rest The action which at any
other time would have seemed disgusting was in the case of this poor
creature merely pitiable

Having come to this resolution the next thing was to disencumber
himself of his irons This was more easily done than he expected He
found in the shed an iron gad and with that and a stone he drove out
the rivets The rings were too strong to be ovalled  or he would
have been free long ago He packed the meat and bread together and
then pushing the gad into his beltit might be needed as a weapon of
defencehe set out on his journey

  OvalledTo oval is a term in use among convicts and
 means so to bend the round ring of the ankle fetter that the
 heel can be drawn up through it

His intention was to get round the settlement to the coast reach the
settled districts and by some tale of shipwreck or of wandering
procure assistance As to what was particularly to be done when he found
himself among free men he did not pause to consider At that point his
difficulties seemed to him to end Let him but traverse the desert that
was before him and he would trust to his own ingenuity or the chance
of fortune to avert suspicion The peril of immediate detection was
so imminent that beside it all other fears were dwarfed into
insignificance

Before dawn next morning he had travelled ten miles and by husbanding
his food he succeeded by the night of the fourth day in accomplishing
forty more Footsore and weary he lay in a thicket of the thorny
melaleuca and felt at last that he was beyond pursuit The next day he
advanced more slowly The bush was unpropitious Dense scrub and savage
jungle impeded his path barren and stony mountain ranges arose before
him He was lost in gullies entangled in thickets bewildered in
morasses The sea that had hitherto gleamed salt glittering and
hungry upon his right hand now shifted to his left He had mistaken his
course and he must turn again For two days did this bewilderment last
and on the third he came to a mighty cliff that pierced with its blunt
pinnacle the clustering bush He must go over or round this obstacle
and he decided to go round it A natural pathway wound about its foot
Here and there branches were broken and it seemed to the poor wretch
fainting under the weight of his lessening burden that his were not the
first footsteps which had trodden there The path terminated in a glade
and at the bottom of this glade was something that fluttered Rufus
Dawes pressed forward and stumbled over a corpse

In the terrible stillness of that solitary place he felt suddenly as
though a voice had called to him All the hideous fantastic tales of
murder which he had read or heard seemed to take visible shape in the
person of the loathly carcase before him clad in the yellow dress of a
convict and lying flung together on the ground as though struck down
Stooping over it impelled by an irresistible impulse to know the worst
he found the body was mangled One arm was missing and the skull had
been beaten in by some heavy instrument The first thoughtthat this
heap of rags and bones was a mute witness to the folly of his own
undertaking the corpse of some starved abscondergave place to a
second more horrible suspicion He recognized the number imprinted on
the coarse cloth as that which had designated the younger of the two
men who had escaped with Gabbett He was standing on the place where a
murder had been committed A murderand what else Thank God the
food he carried was not yet exhausted He turned and fled looking back
fearfully as he went He could not breathe in the shadow of that awful
mountain

Crashing through scrub and brake torn bleeding and wild with terror
he reached a spur on the range and looked around him Above him rose
the iron hills below him lay the panorama of the bush The white cone
of the Frenchmans Cap was on his right hand on his left a succession
of ranges seemed to bar further progress A gleam as of a lake
streaked the eastward Gigantic pine trees reared their graceful heads
against the opal of the evening sky and at their feet the dense scrub
through which he had so painfully toiled spread without break and
without flaw It seemed as though he could leap from where he stood upon
a solid mass of treetops He raised his eyes and right against him
like a long dull sword lay the narrow steelblue reach of the harbour
from which he had escaped One darker speck moved on the dark water
It was the Osprey making for the Gates It seemed that he could throw
a stone upon her deck A faint cry of rage escaped him During the last
three days in the bush he must have retraced his steps and returned
upon his own track to the settlement More than half his allotted time
had passed and he was not yet thirty miles from his prison Death had
waited to overtake him in this barbarous wilderness As a cat allows a
mouse to escape her for a while so had he been permitted to trifle with
his fate and lull himself into a false security Escape was hopeless
now He never could escape and as the unhappy man raised his despairing
eyes he saw that the sun redly sinking behind a lofty pine which
topped the opposite hill shot a ray of crimson light into the glade
below him It was as though a bloody finger pointed at the corpse which
lay there and Rufus Dawes shuddering at the dismal omen averting his
face plunged again into the forest

For four days he wandered aimlessly through the bush He had given up
all hopes of making the overland journey and yet as long as his scanty
supply of food held out he strove to keep away from the settlement
Unable to resist the pangs of hunger he had increased his daily ration
and though the salted meat exposed to rain and heat had begun to turn
putrid he never looked at it but he was seized with a desire to eat his
fill The coarse lumps of carrion and the hard ryeloaves were to him
delicious morsels fit for the table of an emperor Once or twice he
was constrained to pluck and eat the tops of teatrees and peppermint
shrubs These had an aromatic taste and sufficed to stay the cravings
of hunger for a while but they induced a raging thirst which he slaked
at the icy mountain springs Had it not been for the frequency of these
streams he must have died in a few days At last on the twelfth day
from his departure from the Coal Head he found himself at the foot of
Mount Direction at the head of the peninsula which makes the western
side of the harbour His terrible wandering had but led him to make a
complete circuit of the settlement and the next night brought him
round the shores of Birches Inlet to the landingplace opposite to Sarah
Island His stock of provisions had been exhausted for two days and he
was savage with hunger He no longer thought of suicide His dominant
idea was now to get food He would do as many others had done before
himgive himself up to be flogged and fed When he reached the
landingplace however the guardhouse was empty He looked across at
the island prison and saw no sign of life The settlement was deserted
The shock of this discovery almost deprived him of reason For days
that had seemed centuries he had kept life in his jaded and lacerated
body solely by the strength of his fierce determination to reach
the settlement and now that he had reached it after a journey of
unparalleled horror he found it deserted He struck himself to see if
he was not dreaming He refused to believe his eyesight He shouted
screamed and waved his tattered garments in the air Exhausted by these
paroxysms he said to himself quite calmly that the sun beating on
his unprotected head had dazed his brain and that in a few minutes he
should see wellremembered boats pulling towards him Then when no boat
came he argued that he was mistaken in the place the island yonder was
not Sarah Island but some other island like it and that in a second
or so he would be able to detect the difference But the inexorable
mountains so hideously familiar for six weary years made mute
reply and the sea crawling at his feet seemed to grin at him with
a thinlipped hungry mouth Yet the fact of the desertion seemed so
inexplicable that he could not realize it He felt as might have felt
that wanderer in the enchanted mountains who returning in the morning
to look for his companions found them turned to stone

At last the dreadful truth forced itself upon him he retired a few
paces and then with a horrible cry of furious despair stumbled
forward towards the edge of the little reef that fringed the shore
Just as he was about to fling himself for the second time into the dark
water his eyes sweeping in a last long look around the bay caught
sight of a strange appearance on the left horn of the sea beach A thin
blue streak uprising from behind the western arm of the little inlet
hung in the still air It was the smoke of a fire

The dying wretch felt inspired with new hope God had sent him a direct
sign from Heaven The tiny column of bluish vapour seemed to him as
glorious as the Pillar of Fire that led the Israelites There were yet
human beings near himand turning his face from the hungry sea
he tottered with the last effort of his failing strength towards the
blessed token of their presence




CHAPTER IX THE SEIZURE OF THE OSPREY



Freres fishing expedition had been unsuccessful and in consequence
prolonged The obstinacy of his character appeared in the most trifling
circumstances and though the fast deepening shades of an Australian
evening urged him to return yet he lingered unwilling to come back
emptyhanded At last a peremptory signal warned him It was the sound
of a musket fired on board the brig Mr Bates was getting impatient
and with a scowl Frere drew up his lines and ordered the two soldiers
to pull for the vessel

The Osprey yet sat motionless on the water and her bare masts gave no
sign of making sail To the soldiers pulling with their backs to her
the musket shot seemed the most ordinary occurrence in the world Eager
to quit the dismal prisonbay they had viewed Mr Freres persistent
fishing with disgust and had for the previous half hour longed to hear
the signal of recall which had just startled them Suddenly however
they noticed a change of expression in the sullen face of their
commander Frere sitting in the stern sheets with his face to the
Osprey had observed a peculiar appearance on her decks The bulwarks
were every now and then topped by strange figures who disappeared as
suddenly as they came and a faint murmur of voices floated across the
intervening sea Presently the report of another musket shot echoed
among the hills and something dark fell from the side of the vessel
into the water Frere with an imprecation of mingled alarm and
indignation sprang to his feet and shading his eyes with his hand
looked towards the brig The soldiers resting on their oars imitated
his gesture and the whaleboat thus thrown out of trim rocked from
side to side dangerously A moments anxious pause and then another
musket shot followed by a womans shrill scream explained all The
prisoners had seized the brig Give way cried Frere pale with rage
and apprehension and the soldiers realizing at once the full terror of
their position forced the heavy whaleboat through the water as fast as
the one miserable pair of oars could take her


     


Mr Bates affected by the insidious influence of the hour and lulled
into a sense of false security had gone below to tell his little
playmate that she would soon be on her way to the Hobart Town of which
she had heard so much and taking advantage of his absence the soldier
not on guard went to the forecastle to hear the prisoners singing He
found the ten together in high good humour listening to a shanty
sung by three of their number The voices were melodious enough and the
words of the dittychanted by many stout fellows in many a forecastle
before and sinceof that character which pleases the soldier nature
Private Grimes forgot all about the unprotected state of the deck and
sat down to listen

While he listened absorbed in tender recollections James Lesly
William Cheshire William Russen John Fair and James Barker slipped to
the hatchway and got upon the deck Barker reached the aft hatchway as
the soldier who was on guard turned to complete his walk and passing
his arm round his neck pulled him down before he could utter a cry
In the confusion of the moment the man loosed his grip of the musket to
grapple with his unseen antagonist and Fair snatching up the weapon
swore to blow out his brains if he raised a finger Seeing the sentry
thus secured Cheshire as if in pursuance of a preconcerted plan leapt
down the after hatchway and passed up the muskets from the armracks to
Lesly and Russen There were three muskets in addition to the one taken
from the sentry and Barker leaving his prisoner in charge of Fair
seized one of them and ran to the companion ladder Russen left
unarmed by this manoeuvre appeared to know his own duty He came back
to the forecastle and passing behind the listening soldier touched
the singer on the shoulder This was the appointed signal and John Rex
suddenly terminating his song with a laugh presented his fist in the
face of the gaping Grimes No noise he cried The brigs ours
and ere Grimes could reply he was seized by Lyon and Riley and bound
securely

Come on lads says Rex and pass the prisoner down here Weve got
her this time Ill go bail In obedience to this order the now gagged
sentry was flung down the fore hatchway and the hatch secured Stand
on the hatchway Porter cries Rex again and if those fellows come
up knock em down with a handspoke Lesly and Russen forward to the
companion ladder Lyon keep a lookout for the boat and if she comes
too near fire

As he spoke the report of the first musket rang out Barker had
apparently fired up the companion hatchway


     


When Mr Bates had gone below he found Sylvia curled upon the cushions
of the stateroom reading Well missy he said well soon be on
our way to papa

Sylvia answered by asking a question altogether foreign to the subject
Mr Bates said she pushing the hair out of her blue eyes whats a
coracle

A which asked Mr Bates

A coracle Coracle said she spelling it slowly I want to
know

The bewildered Bates shook his head Never heard of one missy said
he bending over the book What does it say

The Ancient Britons said Sylvia reading gravely were little
better than Barbarians They painted their bodies with Woadthats
blue stuff you know Mr Batesand seated in their light coracles
of skin stretched upon slender wooden frames must have presented a wild
and savage appearance

Hah said Mr Bates when this remarkable passage was read to him
thats very mysterious that is A corricle a cory a bright light
burst upon him A curricle you mean missy Its a carriage Ive seen
em in Hy Park with young bloods adrivin of em

What are young bloods asked Sylvia rushing at this new opening

Oh nobs Swell coves dont you know returned poor Bates thus
again attacked Young men o fortune that is thats given to doing it
grand

I see said Sylvia waving her little hand graciously Noblemen and
Princes and that sort of people Quite so But what about coracle

Well said the humbled Bates I think its a carriage missy A sort
of Pheayton as they call it

Sylvia hardly satisfied returned to the book It was a little
meanlooking volumea Childs History of Englandand after perusing
it awhile with knitted brows she burst into a childish laugh

Why my dear Mr Bates she cried waving the History above her head
in triumph what a pair of geese we are A carriage Oh you silly man
Its a boat

Is it said Mr Bates in admiration of the intelligence of his
companion Whod ha thought that now Why couldnt they call it a boat
at once then and ha done with it and he was about to laugh also
when raising his eyes he saw in the open doorway the figure of James
Barker with a musket in his hand

Hallo Whats this What do you do here sir

Sorry to disturb yer says the convict with a grin but you must
come along o me Mr Bates

Bates at once comprehending that some terrible misfortune had occurred
did not lose his presence of mind One of the cushions of the couch was
under his right hand and snatching it up he flung it across the little
cabin full in the face of the escaped prisoner The soft mass struck
the man with force sufficient to blind him for an instant The musket
exploded harmlessly in the air and ere the astonished Barker could
recover his footing Bates had hurled him out of the cabin and crying
Mutiny locked the cabin door on the inside

The noise brought out Mrs Vickers from her berth and the poor little
student of English history ran into her arms

Good Heavens Mr Bates what is it

Bates furious with rage so far forgot himself as to swear Its a
mutiny maam said he Go back to your cabin and lock the door Those
bloody villains have risen on us Julia Vickers felt her heart grow
sick Was she never to escape out of this dreadful life Go into your
cabin maam says Bates again and dont move a finger till I tell
ye Maybe it aint so bad as it looks Ive got my pistols with me
thank God and Mr Frerell hear the shot anyway Mutiny On deck
there he cried at the full pitch of his voice and his brow grew damp
with dismay when a mocking laugh from above was the only response

Thrusting the woman and child into the state berth the bewildered pilot
cocked a pistol and snatching a cutlass from the arm stand fixed to the
butt of the mast which penetrated the cabin he burst open the door with
his foot and rushed to the companion ladder Barker had retreated to
the deck and for an instant he thought the way was clear but Lesly and
Russen thrust him back with the muzzles of the loaded muskets He struck
at Russen with the cutlass missed him and seeing the hopelessness of
the attack was fain to retreat

In the meanwhile Grimes and the other soldier had loosed themselves
from their bonds and encouraged by the firing which seemed to them
a sign that all was not yet lost made shift to force up the forehatch
Porter whose courage was none of the fiercest and who had been for
years given over to that terror of discipline which servitude induces
made but a feeble attempt at resistance and forcing the handspike from
him the sentry Jones rushed aft to help the pilot As Jones reached
the waist Cheshire a coldblooded blueeyed man shot him dead Grimes
fell over the corpse and Cheshire clubbing the muskethad he another
barrel he would have firedcoolly battered his head as he lay and
then seizing the body of the unfortunate Jones in his arms tossed it
into the sea Porter you lubber he cried exhausted with the effort
to lift the body come and bear a hand with this other one Porter
advanced aghast but just then another occurrence claimed the villains
attention and poor Grimess life was spared for that time

Rex inwardly raging at this unexpected resistance on the part of the
pilot flung himself on the skylight and tore it up bodily As he did
so Barker who had reloaded his musket fired down into the cabin
The ball passed through the stateroom door and splintering the wood
buried itself close to the golden curls of poor little Sylvia It was
this hairsbreadth escape which drew from the agonized mother that
shriek which pealing through the open stern window had roused the
soldiers in the boat

Rex who by the virtue of his dandyism yet possessed some abhorrence
of useless crime imagined that the cry was one of pain and that
Barkers bullet had taken deadly effect Youve killed the child you
villain he cried

Whats the odds asked Barker sulkily She must die any way sooner
or later

Rex put his head down the skylight and called on Bates to surrender
but Bates only drew his other pistol Would you commit murder he
asked looking round with desperation in his glance

No no cried some of the men willing to blink the death of poor
Jones Its no use making things worse than they are Bid him come up
and well do him no harm Come up Mr Bates says Rex and I give
you my word you shant be injured

Will you set the majors lady and child ashore then asked Bates
sturdily facing the scowling brows above him

Yes

Without injury continued the other bargaining as it were at the
very muzzles of the muskets

Ay ay Its all right returned Russen Its our liberty we want
thats all

Bates hoping against hope for the return of the boat endeavoured to
gain time Shut down the skylight then said he with the ghost of an
authority in his voice until I ask the lady

This however John Rex refused to do You can ask well enough where
you are he said

But there was no need for Mr Bates to put a question The door of the
stateroom opened and Mrs Vickers appeared trembling with Sylvia by
her side Accept Mr Bates she said since it must be so We should
gain nothing by refusing We are at their mercyGod help us

Amen to that says Bates under his breath and then aloud We agree

Put your pistols on the table and come up then says Rex covering
the table with his musket as he spoke And nobody shall hurt you




CHAPTER X JOHN REXS REVENGE



Mrs Vickers pale and sick with terror yet sustained by that strange
courage of which we have before spoken passed rapidly under the open
skylight and prepared to ascend Sylviaher romance crushed by too
dreadful realityclung to her mother with one hand and with the
other pressed close to her little bosom the English History In her
allabsorbing fear she had forgotten to lay it down

Get a shawl maam or something says Bates and a hat for missy

Mrs Vickers looked back across the space beneath the open skylight
and shuddering shook her head The men above swore impatiently at the
delay and the three hastened on deck

Whos to command the brig now asked undaunted Bates as they came up

I am says John Rex and with these brave fellows Ill take her
round the world

The touch of bombast was not out of place It jumped so far with the
humour of the convicts that they set up a feeble cheer at which Sylvia
frowned Frightened as she was the prisonbred child was as much
astonished at hearing convicts cheer as a fashionable lady would be to
hear her footman quote poetry Bates howeverpractical and calmtook
quite another view of the case The bold project so boldly avowed
seemed to him a sheer absurdity The Dandy and a crew of nine convicts
navigate a brig round the world Preposterous why not a man aboard
could work a reckoning His nautical fancy pictured the Osprey
helplessly rolling on the swell of the Southern Ocean or hopelessly
locked in the ice of the Antarctic Seas and he dimly guessed at the
fate of the deluded ten Even if they got safe to port the chances of
final escape were all against them for what account could they give of
themselves Overpowered by these reflections the honest fellow made one
last effort to charm his captors back to their pristine bondage

Fools he cried do you know what you are about to do You will never
escape Give up the brig and I will declare before my God upon the
Bible that I will say nothing but give all good characters

Lesly and another burst into a laugh at this wild proposition but
Rex who had weighed his chances well beforehand felt the force of the
pilots speech and answered seriously

Its no use talking he said shaking his still handsome head We
have got the brig and we mean to keep her I can navigate her though
I am no seaman so you neednt talk further about it Mr Bates Its
liberty we require

What are you going to do with us asked Bates

Leave you behind

Batess face blanched What here

Yes It dont look a picturesque spot does it And yet Ive lived here
for some years and he grinned

Bates was silent The logic of that grin was unanswerable

Come cried the Dandy shaking off his momentary melancholy look
alive there Lower away the jollyboat Mrs Vickers go down to your
cabin and get anything you want I am compelled to put you ashore but I
have no wish to leave you without clothes Bates listened in a sort
of dismal admiration at this courtly convict He could not have spoken
like that had life depended on it Now my little lady continued Rex
run down with your mamma and dont be frightened

Sylvia flashed burning red at this indignity Frightened If there had
been anybody else here but women you never would have taken the brig
Frightened Let me pass prisoner

The whole deck burst into a great laugh at this and poor Mrs Vickers
paused trembling for the consequences of the childs temerity To thus
taunt the desperate convict who held their lives in his hands seemed
sheer madness In the boldness of the speech however lay its safeguard
Rexwhose politeness was mere bravadowas stung to the quick by the
reflection upon his courage and the bitter accent with which the child
had pronounced the word prisoner the generic name of convicts made him
bite his lips with rage Had he had his will he would have struck the
little creature to the deck but the hoarse laugh of his companions
warned him to forbear There is public opinion even among convicts
and Rex dared not vent his passion on so helpless an object As men do
in such cases he veiled his anger beneath an affectation of amusement
In order to show that he was not moved by the taunt he smiled upon the
taunter more graciously than ever

Your daughter has her fathers spirit madam said he to Mrs Vickers
with a bow

Bates opened his mouth to listen His ears were not large enough to take
in the words of this complimentary convict He began to think that he
was the victim of a nightmare He absolutely felt that John Rex was a
greater man at that moment than John Bates

As Mrs Vickers descended the hatchway the boat with Frere and the
soldiers came within musket range and Lesly according to orders
fired his musket over their heads shouting to them to lay to But Frere
boiling with rage at the manner in which the tables had been turned on
him had determined not to resign his lost authority without a struggle
Disregarding the summons he came straight on with his eyes fixed on
the vessel It was now nearly dark and the figures on the deck were
indistinguishable The indignant lieutenant could but guess at the
condition of affairs Suddenly from out of the darkness a voice hailed
him

Hold water back water it cried and was then seemingly choked in its
owners throat

The voice was the property of Mr Bates Standing near the side he had
observed Rex and Fair bring up a great pig of iron erst used as part of
the ballast of the brig and poise it on the rail Their intention was
but too evident and honest Bates like a faithful watchdog barked
to warn his master Bloodthirsty Cheshire caught him by the throat and
Frere unheeding ran the boat alongside under the very nose of the
revengeful Rex The mass of iron fell half inboard upon the now stayed
boat and gave her sternway with a splintered plank

Villains cried Frere would you swamp us

Aye laughed Rex and a dozen such as ye The brigs ours cant ye
see and were your masters now

Frere stifling an exclamation of rage cried to the bow to hook on but
the bow had driven the boat backward and she was already beyond arms
length of the brig Looking up he saw Cheshires savage face and
heard the click of the lock as he cocked his piece The two soldiers
exhausted by their long pull made no effort to stay the progress of the
boat and almost before the swell caused by the plunge of the mass of
iron had ceased to agitate the water the deck of the Osprey had become
invisible in the darkness

Frere struck his fist upon the thwart in sheer impotence of rage The
scoundrels he said between his teeth theyve mastered us What do
they mean to do next

The answer came pat to the question From the dark hull of the brig
broke a flash and a report and a musket ball cut the water beside
them with a chirping noise Between the black indistinct mass which
represented the brig and the glimmering water was visible a white
speck which gradually neared them

Come alongside with ye hailed a voice or it will be the worse for
ye

They want to murder us says Frere Give way men

But the two soldiers exchanging glances one with the other pulled the
boats head round and made for the vessel Its no use Mr Frere
said the man nearest him we can do no good now and they wont hurt
us I dare say

You dogs you are in league with them bursts out Frere purple with
indignation Do you mutiny

Come come sir returned the soldier sulkily this aint the time
to bully and as for mutiny why one mans about as good as another
just now

This speech from the lips of a man who but a few minutes before would
have risked his life to obey orders of his officer did more than
an hours reasoning to convince Maurice Frere of the hopelessness
of resistance His authorityborn of circumstance and supported by
adventitious aidhad left him The musket shot had reduced him to the
ranks He was now no more than anyone else indeed he was less than
many for those who held the firearms were the ruling powers With a
groan he resigned himself to his fate and looking at the sleeve of the
undress uniform he wore it seemed to him that virtue had gone out of
it When they reached the brig they found that the jollyboat had
been lowered and laid alongside In her were eleven persons Bates with
forehead gashed and hands bound the stunned Grimes Russen and Fair
pulling Lyon Riley Cheshire and Lesly with muskets and John Rex
in the stern sheets with Batess pistols in his trousers belt and a
loaded musket across his knees The white object which had been seen
by the men in the whaleboat was a large white shawl which wrapped Mrs
Vickers and Sylvia

Frere muttered an oath of relief when he saw this white bundle He
had feared that the child was injured By the direction of Rex the
whaleboat was brought alongside the jollyboat and Cheshire and Lesly
boarded her Lesly then gave his musket to Rex and bound Freres
hands behind him in the same manner as had been done for Bates Frere
attempted to resist this indignity but Cheshire clapping his musket
to his ear swore he would blow out his brains if he uttered another
syllable Frere catching the malignant eye of John Rex remembered how
easily a twitch of the finger would pay off old scores and was silent
Step in here sir if you please said Rex with polite irony I am
sorry to be compelled to tie you but I must consult my own safety as
well as your convenience Frere scowled and stepping awkwardly into
the jollyboat fell Pinioned as he was he could not rise without
assistance and Russen pulled him roughly to his feet with a coarse
laugh In his present frame of mind that laugh galled him worse than
his bonds

Poor Mrs Vickers with a womans quick instinct saw this and even
amid her own trouble found leisure to console him The wretches she
said under her breath as Frere was flung down beside her to subject
you to such indignity Sylvia said nothing and seemed to shrink from
the lieutenant Perhaps in her childish fancy she had pictured him as
coming to her rescue armed capapie and clad in dazzling mail or at
the very least as a muscular hero who would settle affairs out of hand
by sheer personal prowess If she had entertained any such notion the
reality must have struck coldly upon her senses Mr Frere purple
clumsy and bound was not at all heroic

Now my lads says Rexwho seemed to have endured the castoff
authority of Frerewe give you your choice Stay at Hells Gates or
come with us

The soldiers paused irresolute To join the mutineers meant a certainty
of hard work with a chance of ultimate hanging Yet to stay with the
prisoners wasas far as they could seeto incur the inevitable fate of
starvation on a barren coast As is often the case on such occasions
a trifle sufficed to turn the scale The wounded Grimes who was slowly
recovering from his stupor dimly caught the meaning of the sentence
and in his obfuscated condition of intellect must needs make comment
upon it Go with him ye beggars said he and leave us honest men
Oh yell get a tyingup for this

The phrase tyingup brought with it recollection of the worst portion
of military discipline the cat and revived in the minds of the pair
already disposed to break the yoke that sat so heavily upon them a
train of dismal memories The life of a soldier on a convict station
was at that time a hard one He was often stinted in rations and of
necessity deprived of all rational recreation while punishment for
offences was prompt and severe The companies drafted to the penal
settlements were not composed of the best material and the pair had
good precedent for the course they were about to take

Come says Rex I cant wait here all night The wind is freshening
and we must make the Bar Which is it to be

Well go with you says the man who had pulled the stroke in the
whaleboat spitting into the water with averted face Upon which
utterance the convicts burst into joyous oaths and the pair were
received with much handshaking

Then Rex with Lyon and Riley as a guard got into the whale boat and
having loosed the two prisoners from their bonds ordered them to take
the place of Russen and Fair The whaleboat was manned by the seven
mutineers Rex steering Fair Russen and the two recruits pulling
and the other four standing up with their muskets levelled at the
jollyboat Their long slavery had begotten such a dread of authority in
these men that they feared it even when it was bound and menaced by four
muskets Keep your distance shouted Cheshire as Frere and Bates in
obedience to orders began to pull the jollyboat towards the shore and
in this fashion was the dismal little party conveyed to the mainland

It was night when they reached it but the clear sky began to thrill
with a late moon as yet unrisen and the waves breaking gently upon
the beach glimmered with a radiance born of their own motion Frere and
Bates jumping ashore helped out Mrs Vickers Sylvia and the wounded
Grimes This being done under the muzzles of the muskets Rex commanded
that Bates and Frere should push the jollyboat as far as they could
from the shore and Riley catching her by a boathook as she came
towards them she was taken in tow

Now boys says Cheshire with a savage delight three cheers for old
England and Liberty

Upon which a great shout went up echoed by the grim hills which had
witnessed so many miseries

To the wretched five this exultant mirth sounded like a knell of death
Great God cried Bates running up to his knees in water after the
departing boats would you leave us here to starve

The only answer was the jerk and dip of the retreating oars




CHAPTER XI LEFT AT HELLS GATES



There is no need to dwell upon the mental agonies of that miserable
night Perhaps of all the five the one least qualified to endure
it realized the prospect of suffering most acutely Mrs
Vickerslayfigure and noodle as she washad the keen instinct of
approaching danger which is in her sex a sixth sense She was a woman
and a mother and owned a double capacity for suffering Her feminine
imagination pictured all the horrors of death by famine and having
realized her own torments her maternal love forced her to live them
over again in the person of her child Rejecting Batess offer of a
peajacket and Freres vague tenders of assistance the poor woman
withdrew behind a rock that faced the sea and with her daughter in her
arms resigned herself to her torturing thoughts Sylvia recovered
from her terror was almost content and curled in her mothers shawl
slept To her little soul this midnight mystery of boats and muskets had
all the flavour of a romance With Bates Frere and her mother so close
to her it was impossible to be afraid besides it was obvious that
papathe Supreme Being of the settlementmust at once return and
severely punish the impertinent prisoners who had dared to insult his
wife and child and as Sylvia dropped off to sleep she caught herself
with some indignation pitying the mutineers for the tremendous scrape
they had got themselves into How they would be flogged when papa came
back In the meantime this sleeping in the open air was novel and rather
pleasant

Honest Bates produced a piece of biscuit and with all the generosity
of his nature suggested that this should be set aside for the sole use
of the two females but Mrs Vickers would not hear of it We must all
share alike said she with something of the spirit that she knew her
husband would have displayed under like circumstance and Frere
wondered at her apparent strength of mind Had he been gifted with more
acuteness he would not have wondered for when a crisis comes to one
of two persons who have lived much together the influence of the nobler
spirit makes itself felt Frere had a tinderbox in his pocket and he
made a fire with some dry leaves and sticks Grimes fell asleep and the
two men sitting at their fire discussed the chances of escape Neither
liked to openly broach the supposition that they had been finally
deserted It was concluded between them that unless the brig sailed in
the nightand the now risen moon showed her yet lying at anchorthe
convicts would return and bring them food This supposition proved
correct for about an hour after daylight they saw the whaleboat
pulling towards them

A discussion had arisen amongst the mutineers as to the propriety of at
once making sail but Barker who had been one of the pilotboat crew
and knew the dangers of the Bar vowed that he would not undertake to
steer the brig through the Gates until morning and so the boats being
secured astern a strict watch was set lest the helpless Bates should
attempt to rescue the vessel During the eveningthe excitement
attendant upon the outbreak having passed away and the magnitude of the
task before them being more fully apparent to their mindsa feeling of
pity for the unfortunate party on the mainland took possession of them
It was quite possible that the Osprey might be recaptured in which case
five useless murders would have been committed and however callous
in bloodshed were the majority of the ten not one among them could
contemplate in cold blood without a twinge of remorse the death of the
harmless child of the Commandant

John Rex seeing how matters were going made haste to take to himself
the credit of mercy He ruled and had always ruled his ruffians not
so much by suggesting to them the course they should take as by leading
them on the way they had already chosen for themselves I propose
said he that we divide the provisions There are five of them and
twelve of us Then nobody can blame us

Ay said Porter mindful of a similar exploit and if were taken
they can tell what we have done Dont let our affair be like that of
the Cypress to leave them to starve Ay ay says Barker youre
right When Fergusson was topped at Hobart Town I heard old Troke say
that if hed not refused to set the tucker ashore he might ha got off
with a whole skin

Thus urged by selfinterest as well as sentiment to mercy the
provision was got upon deck by daylight and a division was made The
soldiers with generosity born of remorse were for giving half to the
marooned men but Barker exclaimed against this When the schooner
finds they dont get to headquarters shes bound to come back and look
for em said he and well want all the tucker we can get maybe
afore we sights land

This reasoning was admitted and acted upon There was in the
harnesscask about fifty pounds of salt meat and a third of this
quantity together with half a small sack of flour some tea and sugar
mixed together in a bag and an iron kettle and pannikin was placed
in the whaleboat Rex fearful of excesses among his crew had also
lowered down one of the two small puncheons of rum which the storeroom
contained Cheshire disputed this and stumbling over a goat that had
been taken on board from Philips Island caught the creature by the
leg and threw it into the sea bidding Rex take that with him also Rex
dragged the poor beast into the boat and with this miscellaneous
cargo pushed off to the shore The poor goat shivering began to bleat
piteously and the men laughed To a stranger it would have appeared
that the boat contained a happy party of fishermen or coast settlers
returning with the proceeds of a days marketing

Laying off as the water shallowed Rex called to Bates to come for the
cargo and three men with muskets standing up as before ready to resist
any attempt at capture the provisions goat and all were carried
ashore There says Rex you cant say weve used you badly for
weve divided the provisions The sight of this almost unexpected
succour revived the courage of the five and they felt grateful After
the horrible anxiety they had endured all that night they were prepared
to look with kindly eyes upon the men who had come to their assistance

Men said Bates with something like a sob in his voice I didnt
expect this You are good fellows for there aint much tucker aboard I
know

Yes affirmed Frere youre good fellows

Rex burst into a savage laugh Shut your mouth you tyrant said he
forgetting his dandyism in the recollection of his former suffering It
aint for your benefit You may thank the lady and the child for it

Julia Vickers hastened to propitiate the arbiter of her daughters
fate We are obliged to you she said with a touch of quiet dignity
resembling her husbands and if I ever get back safely I will take
care that your kindness shall be known

The swindler and forger took off his leather cap with quite an air It
was five years since a lady had spoken to him and the old time when he
was Mr Lionel Crofton a gentleman sportsman came back again for
an instant At that moment with liberty in his hand and fortune all
before him he felt his selfrespect return and he looked the lady in
the face without flinching

I sincerely trust madam said he that you will get back safely May
I hope for your good wishes for myself and my companions

Listening Bates burst into a roar of astonished enthusiasm What a
dog it is he cried John Rex John Rex you were never made to be a
convict man

Rex smiled Goodbye Mr Bates and God preserve you

Goodbye says Bates rubbing his hat off his face and IIdamme
I hope youll get safe offthere for libertys sweet to every man

Goodbye prisoners says Sylvia waving her handkerchief and I hope
they wont catch you too

So with cheers and waving of handkerchiefs the boat departed

In the emotion which the apparently disinterested conduct of John Rex
had occasioned the exiles all earnest thought of their own position
had vanished and strange to say the prevailing feeling was that of
anxiety for the ultimate fate of the mutineers But as the boat grew
smaller and smaller in the distance so did their consciousness of their
own situation grow more and more distinct and when at last the boat had
disappeared in the shadow of the brig all started as if from a dream
to the wakeful contemplation of their own case

A council of war was held with Mr Frere at the head of it and the
possessions of the little party were thrown into common stock The salt
meat flour and tea were placed in a hollow rock at some distance from
the beach and Mr Bates was appointed purser to apportion to each
without fear or favour his stated allowance The goat was tethered with
a piece of fishing line sufficiently long to allow her to browse The
cask of rum by special agreement was placed in the innermost recess
of the rock and it was resolved that its contents should not be touched
except in case of sickness or in last extremity There was no lack of
water for a spring ran bubbling from the rocks within a hundred yards
of the spot where the party had landed They calculated that with
prudence their provisions would last them for nearly four weeks

It was found upon a review of their possessions that they had among
them three pocket knives a ball of string two pipes matches and a fig
of tobacco fishing lines with hooks and a big jackknife which Frere
had taken to gut the fish he had expected to catch But they saw with
dismay that there was nothing which could be used axewise among the
party Mrs Vickers had her shawl and Bates a peajacket but Frere
and Grimes were without extra clothing It was agreed that each should
retain his own property with the exception of the fishing lines which
were confiscated to the commonwealth

Having made these arrangements the kettle filled with water from the
spring was slung from three green sticks over the fire and a pannikin
of weak tea together with a biscuit served out to each of the party
save Grimes who declared himself unable to eat Breakfast over Bates
made a damper which was cooked in the ashes and then another council
was held as to future habitation

It was clearly evident that they could not sleep in the open air It was
the middle of summer and though no annoyance from rain was apprehended
the heat in the middle of the day was most oppressive Moreover it was
absolutely necessary that Mrs Vickers and the child should have some
place to themselves At a little distance from the beach was a sandy
rise that led up to the face of the cliff and on the eastern side of
this rise grew a forest of young trees Frere proposed to cut down
these trees and make a sort of hut with them It was soon discovered
however that the pocket knives were insufficient for this purpose but
by dint of notching the young saplings and then breaking them down they
succeeded in a couple of hours in collecting wood enough to roof
over a space between the hollow rock which contained the provisions and
another rock in shape like a hammer which jutted out within five
yards of it Mrs Vickers and Sylvia were to have this hut as a
sleepingplace and Frere and Bates lying at the mouth of the larder
would at once act as a guard to it and them Grimes was to make for
himself another hut where the fire had been lighted on the previous
night

When they got back to dinner inspirited by this resolution they found
poor Mrs Vickers in great alarm Grimes who by reason of the dint
in his skull had been left behind was walking about the seabeach
talking mysteriously and shaking his fist at an imaginary foe On going
up to him they discovered that the blow had affected his brain for he
was delirious Frere endeavoured to soothe him without effect and at
last by Batess advice the poor fellow was rolled in the sea The cold
bath quelled his violence and being laid beneath the shade of a rock
hard by he fell into a condition of great muscular exhaustion and
slept

The damper was then portioned out by Bates and together with a small
piece of meat it formed the dinner of the party Mrs Vickers reported
that she had observed a great commotion on board the brig and thought
that the prisoners must be throwing overboard such portions of the cargo
as were not absolutely necessary to them in order to lighten her This
notion Bates declared to be correct and further pointed out that the
mutineers had got out a kedgeanchor and by hauling on the kedgeline
were gradually warping the brig down the harbour Before dinner was
over a light breeze sprang up and the Osprey running up the unionjack
reversed fired a musket either in farewell or triumph and spreading
her sails disappeared round the western horn of the harbour

Mrs Vickers taking Sylvia with her went away a few paces and leaning
against the rugged wall of her future home wept bitterly Bates and
Frere affected cheerfulness but each felt that he had hitherto regarded
the presence of the brig as a sort of safeguard and had never fully
realized his own loneliness until now

The necessity for work however admitted of no indulgence of vain
sorrow and Bates setting the example the pair worked so hard that by
nightfall they had torn down and dragged together sufficient brushwood
to complete Mrs Vickerss hut During the progress of this work they
were often interrupted by Grimes who persisted in vague rushes at them
exclaiming loudly against their supposed treachery in leaving him at the
mercy of the mutineers Bates also complained of the pain caused by the
wound in his forehead and that he was afflicted with a giddiness which
he knew not how to avert By dint of frequently bathing his head at the
spring however he succeeded in keeping on his legs until the work of
dragging together the boughs was completed when he threw himself on the
ground and declared that he could rise no more

Frere applied to him the remedy that had been so successfully tried upon
Grimes but the salt water inflamed his wound and rendered his condition
worse Mrs Vickers recommended that a little spirit and water should
be used to wash the cut and the cask was got out and broached for that
purpose Tea and damper formed their evening meal and by the light of
a blazing fire their condition looked less desperate Mrs Vickers
had set the pannikin on a flat stone and dispensed the tea with an
affectation of dignity which would have been absurd had it not been
heartrending She had smoothed her hair and pinned the white shawl
about her coquettishly she even ventured to lament to Mr Frere that
she had not brought more clothes Sylvia was in high spirits and
scorned to confess hunger When the tea had been drunk she fetched
water from the spring in the kettle and bathed Batess head with it It
was resolved that on the morrow a search should be made for some place
from which to cast the fishing line and that one of the number should
fish daily

The condition of the unfortunate Grimes now gave cause for the greatest
uneasiness From maundering foolishly he had taken to absolute violence
and had to be watched by Frere After much muttering and groaning the
poor fellow at last dropped off to sleep and Frere having assisted
Bates to his sleepingplace in front of the rock and laid him down on
a heap of green brushwood prepared to snatch a few hours slumber
Wearied by excitement and the labours of the day he slept heavily but
towards morning was awakened by a strange noise

Grimes whose delirium had apparently increased had succeeded in
forcing his way through the rude fence of brushwood and had thrown
himself upon Bates with the ferocity of insanity Growling to himself
he had seized the unfortunate pilot by the throat and the pair were
struggling together Bates weakened by the sickness that had followed
upon his wound in the head was quite unable to cope with his desperate
assailant but calling feebly upon Frere for help had made shift to lay
hold upon the jackknife of which we have before spoken Frere starting
to his feet rushed to the assistance of the pilot but was too late
Grimes enraged by the sight of the knife tore it from Batess
grasp and before Frere could catch his arm plunged it twice into the
unfortunate mans breast

Im a dead man cried Bates faintly

The sight of the blood together with the exclamation of his victim
recalled Grimes to consciousness He looked in bewilderment at the
bloody weapon and then flinging it from him rushed away towards the
sea into which he plunged headlong

Frere aghast at this sudden and terrible tragedy gazed after him and
saw from out the placid water sparkling in the bright beams of morning
a pair of arms with outstretched hands emerge a black spot that was
a head uprose between these stiffening arms and then with a horrible
cry the whole disappeared and the bright water sparkled as placidly as
before The eyes of the terrified Frere travelling back to the wounded
man saw midway between this sparkling water and the knife that lay on
the sand an object that went far to explain the maniacs sudden burst
of fury The rum cask lay upon its side by the remnants of last nights
fire and close to it was a clout with which the head of the wounded
man had been bound It was evident that the poor creature wandering
in his delirium had come across the rum cask drunk a quantity of its
contents and been maddened by the fiery spirit

Frere hurried to the side of Bates and lifting him up strove to
staunch the blood that flowed from his chest It would seem that he had
been resting himself on his left elbow and that Grimes snatching the
knife from his right hand had stabbed him twice in the right breast
He was pale and senseless and Frere feared that the wound was mortal
Tearing off his neckhandkerchief he endeavoured to bandage the wound
but found that the strip of silk was insufficient for the purpose The
noise had roused Mrs Vickers who stifling her terror made haste to
tear off a portion of her dress and with this a bandage of sufficient
width was made Frere went to the cask to see if haply he could obtain
from it a little spirit with which to moisten the lips of the dying man
but it was empty Grimes after drinking his fill had overturned
the unheaded puncheon and the greedy sand had absorbed every drop of
liquor Sylvia brought some water from the spring and Mrs Vickers
bathing Batess head with this he revived a little Byandby Mrs
Vickers milked the goatshe had never done such a thing before in all
her lifeand the milk being given to Bates in a pannikin he drank it
eagerly but vomited it almost instantly It was evident that he was
sinking from some internal injury

None of the party had much appetite for breakfast but Frere whose
sensibilities were less acute than those of the others ate a piece of
salt meat and damper It struck him with a curious feeling of pleasant
selfishness that now Grimes had gone the allowance of provisions would
be increased and that if Bates went also it would be increased still
further He did not give utterance to his thoughts however but sat
with the wounded mans head on his knees and brushed the settling flies
from his face He hoped after all that the pilot would not die for
he should then be left alone to look after the women Perhaps some such
thought was agitating Mrs Vickers also As for Sylvia she made no
secret of her anxiety

Dont die Mr Batesoh dont die she said standing piteously
near but afraid to touch him Dont leave mamma and me alone in this
dreadful place

Poor Bates of course said nothing but Frere frowned heavily and Mrs
Vickers said reprovingly Sylvia just as if they had been in the old
house on distant Sarah Island

In the afternoon Frere went away to drag together some wood for the
fire and when he returned he found the pilot near his end Mrs Vickers
said that for an hour he had lain without motion and almost without
breath The majors wife had seen more than one deathbed and was calm
enough but poor little Sylvia sitting on a stone hard by shook with
terror She had a dim notion that death must be accompanied by violence
As the sun sank Bates rallied but the two watchers knew that it was
but the final flicker of the expiring candle Hes going said
Frere at length under his breath as though fearful of awaking his
halfslumbering soul Mrs Vickers her eyes streaming with silent
tears lifted the honest head and moistened the parched lips with her
soaked handkerchief A tremor shook the once stalwart limbs and the
dying man opened his eyes For an instant he seemed bewildered and
then looking from one to the other intelligence returned to his
glance and it was evident that he remembered all His gaze rested upon
the pale face of the affrighted Sylvia and then turned to Frere There
could be no mistaking the mute appeal of those eloquent eyes

Yes Ill take care of her said Frere

Bates smiled and then observing that the blood from his wound had
stained the white shawl of Mrs Vickers he made an effort to move his
head It was not fitting that a ladys shawl should be stained with the
blood of a poor fellow like himself The fashionable fribble with quick
instinct understood the gesture and gently drew the head back upon her
bosom In the presence of death the woman was womanly For a moment all
was silent and they thought he had gone but all at once he opened his
eyes and looked round for the sea

Turn my face to it once more he whispered and as they raised him
he inclined his ear to listen Its calm enough here God bless it he
said but I can hear the waves abreaking hard upon the Bar

And so his head dropped and he died

As Frere relieved Mrs Vickers from the weight of the corpse Sylvia ran
to her mother Oh mamma mamma she cried why did God let him die
when we wanted him so much

Before it grew dark Frere made shift to carry the body to the shelter
of some rocks at a little distance and spreading the jacket over the
face he piled stones upon it to keep it steady The march of events had
been so rapid that he scarcely realized that since the previous evening
two of the five human creatures left in this wilderness had escaped
from it As he did realize it he began to wonder whose turn it would be
next

Mrs Vickers worn out by the fatigue and excitement of the day retired
to rest early and Sylvia refusing to speak to Frere followed her
mother This manifestation of unaccountable dislike on the part of the
child hurt Maurice more than he cared to own He felt angry with her for
not loving him and yet he took no pains to conciliate her It was with
a curious pleasure that he remembered how she must soon look up to him
as her chief protector Had Sylvia been just a few years older the
young man would have thought himself in love with her

The following day passed gloomily It was hot and sultry and a dull
haze hung over the mountains Frere spent the morning in scooping a
grave in the sand in which to inter poor Bates Practically awake to
his own necessities he removed such portions of clothing from the body
as would be useful to him but hid them under a stone not liking to let
Mrs Vickers see what he had done Having completed the grave by midday
he placed the corpse therein and rolled as many stones as possible to
the sides of the mound In the afternoon he cast the fishing line from
the point of a rock he had marked the day before but caught nothing
Passing by the grave on his return he noticed that Mrs Vickers had
placed at the head of it a rude cross formed by tying two pieces of
stick together

After supperthe usual salt meat and damperhe lit an economical pipe
and tried to talk to Sylvia Why wont you be friends with me missy
he asked

I dont like you said Sylvia You frighten me

Why

You are not kind I dont mean that you do cruel things but you
areoh I wish papa was here Wishing wont bring him says Frere
pressing his hoarded tobacco together with prudent forefinger

There Thats what I mean Is that kind Wishing wont bring him Oh
if it only would

I didnt mean it unkindly says Frere What a strange child you are

There are persons says Sylvia who have no Affinity for each other
I read about it in a book papa had and I suppose thats what it is I
have no Affinity for you I cant help it can I

Rubbish Frere returned Come here and Ill tell you a story

Mrs Vickers had gone back to her cave and the two were alone by the
fire near which stood the kettle and the newlymade damper The child
with some show of hesitation came to him and he caught and placed her
on his knee The moon had not yet risen and the shadows cast by the
flickering fire seemed weird and monstrous The wicked wish to frighten
this helpless creature came to Maurice Frere

There was once said he a Castle in an old wood and in this Castle
there lived an Ogre with great goggle eyes

You silly man said Sylvia struggling to be free You are trying to
frighten me

And this Ogre lived on the bones of little girls One day a little girl
was travelling the wood and she heard the Ogre coming Haw haw Haw
haw

Mr Frere let me down

She was terribly frightened and she ran and ran and ran until all
of a sudden she saw

A piercing scream burst from his companion Oh oh Whats that she
cried and clung to her persecutor

Beyond the fire stood the figure of a man He staggered forward and
then falling on his knees stretched out his hands and hoarsely
articulated one wordFood It was Rufus Dawes

The sound of a human voice broke the spell of terror that was on the
child and as the glow from the fire fell upon the tattered yellow
garments she guessed at once the whole story Not so Maurice Frere He
saw before him a new danger a new mouth to share the scanty provision
and snatching a brand from the fire he kept the convict at bay But
Rufus Dawes glaring round with wolfish eyes caught sight of the damper
resting against the iron kettle and made a clutch at it Frere dashed
the brand in his face Stand back he cried We have no food to
spare

The convict uttered a savage cry and raising the iron gad plunged
forward desperately to attack this new enemy but quick as thought the
child glided past Frere and snatching the loaf placed it in the hands
of the starving man with Here poor prisoner eat and then turning
to Frere she cast upon him a glance so full of horror indignation and
surprise that the man blushed and threw down the brand

As for Rufus Dawes the sudden apparition of this goldenhaired girl
seemed to have transformed him Allowing the loaf to slip through his
fingers he gazed with haggard eyes at the retreating figure of the
child and as it vanished into the darkness outside the circle of
firelight the unhappy man sank his face upon his blackened horny
hands and burst into tears




CHAPTER XII MR DAWES



The coarse tones of Maurice Frere roused him What do you want he
asked Rufus Dawes raising his head contemplated the figure before
him and recognized it Is it you he said slowly

What do you mean Do you know me asked Frere drawing back But the
convict did not reply His momentary emotion passed away the pangs of
hunger returned and greedily seizing upon the piece of damper he began
to eat in silence

Do you hear man repeated Frere at length What are you

An escaped prisoner You can give me up in the morning Ive done my
best and Im beat

The sentence struck Frere with dismay The man did not know that the
settlement had been abandoned

I cannot give you up There is no one but myself and a woman and child
on the settlement Rufus Dawes pausing in his eating stared at him in
amazement The prisoners have gone away in the schooner If you choose
to remain free you can do so as far as I am concerned I am as helpless
as you are

But how do you come here

Frere laughed bitterly To give explanations to convicts was foreign to
his experience and he did not relish the task In this case however
there was no help for it The prisoners mutinied and seized the brig

What brig

The Osprey

A terrible light broke upon Rufus Dawes and he began to understand how
he had again missed his chance Who took her

That doubledyed villain John Rex says Frere giving vent to his
passion May she sink and burn and

Have they gone then cried the miserable man clutching at his hair
with a gesture of hopeless rage

Yes two days ago and left us here to starve Rufus Dawes burst into
a laugh so discordant that it made the other shudder Well starve
together Maurice Frere said he for while youve a crust Ill share
it If I dont get liberty at least Ill have revenge

The sinister aspect of this famished savage sitting with his chin on
his ragged knees rocking himself to and fro in the light of the fire
gave Mr Maurice Frere a new sensation He felt as might have felt that
African hunter who returning to his camp fire found a lion there
Wretch said he shrinking from him why should you wish to be
revenged on me

The convict turned upon him with a snarl Take care what you say Ill
have no hard words Wretch If I am a wretch who made me one If I hate
you and myself and the world who made me hate it I was born freeas
free as you are Why should I be sent to herd with beasts and condemned
to this slavery worse than death Tell me that Maurice Freretell me
that I didnt make the laws says Frere why do you attack me

Because you are what I was You are FREE You can do as you please You
can love you can work you can think I can only hate He paused as if
astonished at himself and then continued with a low laugh Fine words
for a convict eh But never mind its all right Mr Frere were
equal now and I shant die an hour sooner than you though you are a
free man

Frere began to think that he was dealing with another madman

Die Theres no need to talk of dying he said as soothingly as it
was possible for him to say it Time enough for that byandby

There spoke the free man We convicts have an advantage over you
gentlemen You are afraid of death we pray for it It is the best thing
that can happen to us Die They were going to hang me once I wish they
had My God I wish they had

There was such a depth of agony in this terrible utterance that Maurice
Frere was appalled at it There go and sleep my man he said You
are knocked up Well talk in the morning

Hold on a bit cried Rufus Dawes with a coarseness of manner
altogether foreign to that he had just assumed Whos with ye

The wife and daughter of the Commandant replied Frere half afraid to
refuse an answer to a question so fiercely put

No one else

No Poor souls said the convict I pity them And then he
stretched himself like a dog before the blaze and went to sleep
instantly Maurice Frere looking at the gaunt figure of this addition
to the party was completely puzzled how to act Such a character had
never before come within the range of his experience He knew not what
to make of this fierce ragged desperate man who wept and threatened
by turnswho was now snarling in the most repulsive bass of the convict
gamut and now calling upon Heaven in tones which were little less than
eloquent At first he thought of precipitating himself upon the sleeping
wretch and pinioning him but a second glance at the sinewy though
wasted limbs forbade him to follow out the rash suggestion of his
own fears Then a horrible promptingarising out of his former
cowardicemade him feel for the jackknife with which one murder had
already been committed Their stock of provisions was so scanty and
after all the lives of the woman and child were worth more than that
of this unknown desperado But to do him justice the thought no sooner
shaped itself than he crushed it out Well wait till morning and
see how he shapes said Frere to himself and pausing at the brushwood
barricade behind which the mother and daughter were clinging to each
other he whispered that he was on guard outside and that the absconder
slept But when morning dawned he found that there was no need for
alarm The convict was lying in almost the same position as that
in which he had left him and his eyes were closed His threatening
outbreak of the previous night had been produced by the excitement of
his sudden rescue and he was now incapable of violence Frere advanced
and shook him by the shoulder

Not alive cried the poor wretch waking with a start and raising his
arm to strike Keep off

Its all right said Frere No one is going to harm you Wake up

Rufus Dawes glanced around him stupidly and then remembering what had
happened with a great effort he staggered to his feet I thought
theyd got me he said but its the other way I see Come lets
have breakfast Mr Frere Im hungry

You must wait said Frere Do you think there is no one here but
yourself

Rufus Dawes swaying to and fro from weakness passed his shred of a
cuff over his eyes I dont know anything about it I only know Im
hungry

Frere stopped short Now or never was the time to settle future
relations Lying awake in the night with the jackknife ready to his
hand he had decided on the course of action that must be adopted The
convict should share with the rest but no more If he rebelled at that
there must be a trial of strength between them Look you here he
said We have but barely enough food to serve us until help comesif
it does come I have the care of that poor woman and child and I will
see fair play for their sakes You shall share with us to our last bit
and drop but by Heaven you shall get no more

The convict stretching out his wasted arms looked down upon them with
the uncertain gaze of a drunken man I am weak now he said You
have the best of me and then he sank suddenly down upon the ground
exhausted Give me a drink he moaned feebly motioning with his hand
Frere got him water in the pannikin and having drunk it he smiled and
lay down to sleep again Mrs Vickers and Sylvia coming out while he
still slept recognized him as the desperado of the settlement

He was the most desperate man we had said Mrs Vickers identifying
herself with her husband Oh what shall we do

He wont do much harm returned Frere looking down at the notorious
ruffian with curiosity Hes as near dead as can be

Sylvia looked up at him with her clear childs glance We mustnt let
him die said she That would be murder No no returned Frere
hastily no one wants him to die But what can we do

Ill nurse him cried Sylvia

Frere broke into one of his coarse laughs the first one that he had
indulged in since the mutiny You nurse him By George thats a good
one The poor little child weak and excitable felt the contempt in
the tone and burst into a passion of sobs Why do you insult me you
wicked man The poor fellows ill and hellhell die like Mr Bates
Oh mamma mamma Lets go away by ourselves

Frere swore a great oath and walked away He went into the little wood
under the cliff and sat down He was full of strange thoughts which he
could not express and which he had never owned before The dislike
the child bore to him made him miserable and yet he took delight in
tormenting her He was conscious that he had acted the part of a
coward the night before in endeavouring to frighten her and that the
detestation she bore him was well earned but he had fully determined to
stake his life in her defence should the savage who had thus come upon
them out of the desert attempt violence and he was unreasonably angry
at the pity she had shown It was not fair to be thus misinterpreted
But he had done wrong to swear and more so in quitting them so
abruptly The consciousness of his wrongdoing however only made
him more confirmed in it His native obstinacy would not allow him to
retract what he had saideven to himself Walking along he came to
Batess grave and the cross upon it Here was another evidence of
illtreatment She had always preferred Bates Now that Bates was gone
she must needs transfer her childish affections to a convict Oh said
Frere to himself with pleasant recollections of many coarse triumphs in
lovemaking if you were a woman you little vixen Id make you love
me When he had said this he laughed at himself for his follyhe was
turning romantic When he got back he found Dawes stretched upon the
brushwood with Sylvia sitting near him

He is better said Mrs Vickers disdaining to refer to the scene of
the morning Sit down and have something to eat Mr Frere

Are you better asked Frere abruptly

To his surprise the convict answered quite civilly I shall be strong
again in a day or two and then I can help you sir

Help me How To build a hut here for the ladies And well live here
all our lives and never go back to the sheds any more

He has been wandering a little said Mrs Vickers Poor fellow he
seems quite well behaved

The convict began to sing a little German song and to beat the refrain
with his hand Frere looked at him with curiosity I wonder what the
story of that mans life has been he said A queer one Ill be
bound

Sylvia looked up at him with a forgiving smile Ill ask him when he
gets well she said and if you are good Ill tell you Mr Frere

Frere accepted the proffered friendship I am a great brute Sylvia
sometimes aint I he said but I dont mean it

You are returned Sylvia frankly but lets shake hands and be
friends Its no use quarrelling when there are only four of us is it
And in this way was Rufus Dawes admitted a member of the family circle

Within a week from the night on which he had seen the smoke of Freres
fire the convict had recovered his strength and had become an
important personage The distrust with which he had been at first viewed
had worn off and he was no longer an outcast to be shunned and pointed
at or to be referred to in whispers He had abandoned his rough manner
and no longer threatened or complained and though at times a profound
melancholy would oppress him his spirits were more even than those of
Frere who was often moody sullen and overbearing Rufus Dawes was no
longer the brutalized wretch who had plunged into the dark waters of the
bay to escape a life he loathed and had alternately cursed and wept
in the solitudes of the forests He was an active member of societya
society of fourand he began to regain an air of independence and
authority This change had been wrought by the influence of little
Sylvia Recovered from the weakness consequent upon this terrible
journey Rufus Dawes had experienced for the first time in six years
the soothing power of kindness He had now an object to live for beyond
himself He was of use to somebody and had he died he would have
been regretted To us this means little to this unhappy man it meant
everything He found to his astonishment that he was not despised and
that by the strange concurrence of circumstances he had been brought
into a position in which his convict experiences gave him authority
He was skilled in all the mysteries of the prison sheds He knew how to
sustain life on as little food as possible He could fell trees without
an axe bake bread without an oven build a weatherproof hut without
bricks or mortar From the patient he became the adviser and from the
adviser the commander In the semisavage state to which these four
human beings had been brought he found that savage accomplishments
were of most value Might was Right and Maurice Freres authority of
gentility soon succumbed to Rufus Dawess authority of knowledge

As the time wore on and the scanty stock of provisions decreased he
found that his authority grew more and more powerful Did a question
arise as to the qualities of a strange plant it was Rufus Dawes who
could pronounce upon it Were fish to be caught it was Rufus Dawes
who caught them Did Mrs Vickers complain of the instability of her
brushwood hut it was Rufus Dawes who worked a wicker shield and
plastering it with clay produced a wall that defied the keenest wind
He made cups out of pineknots and plates out of barkstrips He worked
harder than any three men Nothing daunted him nothing discouraged him
When Mrs Vickers fell sick from anxiety and insufficient food it was
Rufus Dawes who gathered fresh leaves for her couch who cheered her by
hopeful words who voluntarily gave up half his own allowance of meat
that she might grow stronger on it The poor woman and her child called
him Mr Dawes

Frere watched all this with dissatisfaction that amounted at times
to positive hatred Yet he could say nothing for he could not but
acknowledge that beside Dawes he was incapable He even submitted
to take orders from this escaped convictit was so evident that the
escaped convict knew better than he Sylvia began to look upon Dawes as
a second Bates He was moreover all her own She had an interest in
him for she had nursed and protected him If it had not been for
her this prodigy would not have lived He felt for her an absorbing
affection that was almost a passion She was his good angel his
protectress his glimpse of Heaven She had given him food when he was
starving and had believed in him when the worldthe world of fourhad
looked coldly on him He would have died for her and for love of her
hoped for the vessel which should take her back to freedom and give him
again into bondage

But the days stole on and no vessel appeared Each day they eagerly
scanned the watery horizon each day they longed to behold the bowsprit
of the returning Ladybird glide past the jutting rock that shut out the
view of the harbourbut in vain Mrs Vickerss illness increased
and the stock of provisions began to run short Dawes talked of putting
himself and Frere on half allowance It was evident that unless succour
came in a few days they must starve

Frere mooted all sorts of wild plans for obtaining food He would make
a journey to the settlement and swimming the estuary search if haply
any casks of biscuit had been left behind in the hurry of departure He
would set springes for the seagulls and snare the pigeons at Liberty
Point But all these proved impracticable and with blank faces they
watched their bag of flour grow smaller and smaller daily Then the
notion of escape was broached Could they construct a raft Impossible
without nails or ropes Could they build a boat Equally impossible for
the same reason Could they raise a fire sufficient to signal a ship
Easily but what ship would come within reach of that doublydesolate
spot Nothing could be done but wait for a vessel which was sure to
come for them sooner or later and growing weaker day by day they
waited

One morning Sylvia was sitting in the sun reading the English History
which by the accident of fright she had brought with her on the night
of the mutiny Mr Frere said she suddenly what is an alchemist

A man who makes gold was Freres not very accurate definition

Do you know one

No

Do you Mr Dawes

I knew a man once who thought himself one

What A man who made gold

After a fashion

But did he make gold persisted Sylvia

No not absolutely make it But he was in his worship of money an
alchemist for all that

What became of him

I dont know said Dawes with so much constraint in his tone that the
child instinctively turned the subject

Then alchemy is a very old art

Oh yes

Did the Ancient Britons know it

No not as old as that

Sylvia suddenly gave a little scream The remembrance of the evening
when she read about the Ancient Britons to poor Bates came vividly into
her mind and though she had since reread the passage that had then
attracted her attention a hundred times it had never before presented
itself to her in its full significance Hurriedly turning the
wellthumbed leaves she read aloud the passage which had provoked
remark

The Ancient Britons were little better than Barbarians They
painted their bodies with Woad and seated in their light coracles of
skin stretched upon slender wooden frames must have presented a wild
and savage appearance

A coracle Thats a boat Cant we make a coracle Mr Dawes




CHAPTER XIII WHAT THE SEAWEED SUGGESTED



The question gave the marooned party new hopes Maurice Frere with his
usual impetuosity declared that the project was a most feasible one
and wonderedas such men will wonderthat it had never occurred to him
before Its the simplest thing in the world he cried Sylvia
you have saved us But upon taking the matter into more earnest
consideration it became apparent that they were as yet a long way
from the realization of their hopes To make a coracle of skins seemed
sufficiently easy but how to obtain the skins The one miserable
hide of the unlucky shegoat was utterly inadequate for the purpose
Sylviaher face beaming with the hope of escape and with delight at
having been the means of suggesting itwatched narrowly the countenance
of Rufus Dawes but she marked no answering gleam of joy in those eyes
Cant it be done Mr Dawes she asked trembling for the reply

The convict knitted his brows gloomily

Come Dawes cried Frere forgetting his enmity for an instant in the
flash of new hope cant you suggest something

Rufus Dawes thus appealed to as the acknowledged Head of the little
society felt a pleasant thrill of selfsatisfaction I dont know
he said I must think of it It looks easy and yet He paused as
something in the water caught his eye It was a mass of bladdery seaweed
that the returning tide was wafting slowly to the shore This object
which would have passed unnoticed at any other time suggested to Rufus
Dawes a new idea Yes he added slowly with a change of tone it may
be done I think I can see my way

The others preserved a respectful silence until he should speak again
How far do you think it is across the bay he asked of Frere

What to Sarah Island

No to the Pilot Station

About four miles

The convict sighed Too far to swim now though I might have done it
once But this sort of life weakens a man It must be done after all

What are you going to do asked Frere

To kill the goat

Sylvia uttered a little cry she had become fond of her dumb companion
Kill Nanny Oh Mr Dawes What for

I am going to make a boat for you he said and I want hides and
thread and tallow

A few weeks back Maurice Frere would have laughed at such a sentence
but he had begun now to comprehend that this escaped convict was not a
man to be laughed at and though he detested him for his superiority he
could not but admit that he was superior

You cant get more than one hide off a goat man he said with an
inquiring tone in his voiceas though it was just possible that such
a marvellous being as Dawes could get a second hide by virtue of some
secret process known only to himself

I am going to catch other goats Where

At the Pilot Station

But how are you going to get there

Float across Come there is not time for questioning Go and cut down
some saplings and let us begin

The lieutenantmaster looked at the convict prisoner with astonishment
and then gave way to the power of knowledge and did as he was ordered
Before sundown that evening the carcase of poor Nanny broken into
various most unbutcherly fragments was hanging on the nearest tree and
Frere returning with as many young saplings as he could drag together
found Rufus Dawes engaged in a curious occupation He had killed the
goat and having cut off its head close under the jaws and its legs
at the kneejoint had extracted the carcase through a slit made in the
lower portion of the belly which slit he had now sewn together with
string This proceeding gave him a rough bag and he was busily engaged
in filling this bag with such coarse grass as he could collect Frere
observed also that the fat of the animal was carefully preserved and
the intestines had been placed in a pool of water to soak

The convict however declined to give information as to what he
intended to do Its my own notion he said Let me alone I may make
a failure of it Frere on being pressed by Sylvia affected to know
all about the scheme but to impose silence on himself He was galled to
think that a convict brain should contain a mystery which he might not
share

On the next day by Rufus Dawess direction Frere cut down some rushes
that grew about a mile from the camping ground and brought them in on
his back This took him nearly half a day to accomplish Short rations
were beginning to tell upon his physical powers The convict on the
other hand trained by a woeful experience in the Boats to endurance of
hardship was slowly recovering his original strength

What are they for asked Frere as he flung the bundles down His
master condescended to reply To make a float

Well

The other shrugged his broad shoulders You are very dull Mr Frere
I am going to swim over to the Pilot Station and catch some of those
goats I can get across on the stuffed skin but I must float them back
on the reeds

How the doose do you mean to catch em asked Frere wiping the sweat
from his brow

The convict motioned to him to approach He did so and saw that his
companion was cleaning the intestines of the goat The outer membrane
having been peeled off Rufus Dawes was turning the gut inside out
This he did by turning up a short piece of it as though it were a
coatsleeve and dipping the turnedup cuff into a pool of water The
weight of the water pressing between the cuff and the rest of the gut
bore down a further portion and so by repeated dippings the whole
length was turned inside out The inner membrane having been scraped
away there remained a fine transparent tube which was tightly twisted
and set to dry in the sun

There is the catgut for the noose said Dawes I learnt that trick at
the settlement Now come here

Frere following saw that a fire had been made between two stones and
that the kettle was partly sunk in the ground near it On approaching
the kettle he found it full of smooth pebbles

Take out those stones said Dawes

Frere obeyed and saw at the bottom of the kettle a quantity of
sparkling white powder and the sides of the vessel crusted with the
same material

Whats that he asked

Salt

How did you get it

I filled the kettle with seawater and then heating those pebbles
redhot in the fire dropped them into it We could have caught the
steam in a cloth and wrung out fresh water had we wished to do so But
thank God we have plenty

Frere started Did you learn that at the settlement too he asked

Rufus Dawes laughed with a sort of bitterness in his tones Do you
think I have been at the settlement all my life The thing is very
simple it is merely evaporation

Frere burst out in sudden fretful admiration What a fellow you are
Dawes What are youI mean what have you been

A triumphant light came into the others face and for the instant he
seemed about to make some startling revelation But the light faded and
he checked himself with a gesture of pain

I am a convict Never mind what I have been A sailor a shipbuilder
prodigal vagabondwhat does it matter It wont alter my fate will
it

If we get safely back says Frere Ill ask for a free pardon for
you You deserve it

Come returned Dawes with a discordant laugh Let us wait until we
get back

You dont believe me

I dont want favour at your hands he said with a return of the old
fierceness Let us get to work Bring up the rushes here and tie them
with a fishing line

At this instant Sylvia came up Good afternoon Mr Dawes Hard at
work Oh whats this in the kettle The voice of the child acted like
a charm upon Rufus Dawes He smiled quite cheerfully

Salt miss I am going to catch the goats with that

Catch the goats How Put it on their tails she cried merrily

Goats are fond of salt and when I get over to the Pilot Station I
shall set traps for them baited with this salt When they come to
lick it I shall have a noose of catgut ready to catch themdo you
understand

But how will you get across

You will see tomorrow




CHAPTER XIV A WONDERFUL DAYS WORK



The next morning Rufus Dawes was stirring by daylight He first got his
catgut wound upon a piece of stick and then having moved his frail
floats alongside the little rock that served as a pier he took a
fishing line and a larger piece of stick and proceeded to draw a
diagram on the sand This diagram when completed represented a rude
outline of a punt eight feet long and three broad At certain distances
were eight pointsfour on each sideinto which small willow rods were
driven He then awoke Frere and showed the diagram to him

Get eight stakes of celerytop pine he said You can burn them where
you cannot cut them and drive a stake into the place of each of these
willow wands When you have done that collect as many willows as you
can get I shall not be back until tonight Now give me a hand with the
floats

Frere coming to the pier saw Dawes strip himself and piling his
clothes upon the stuffed goatskin stretch himself upon the reed
bundles and paddling with his hands push off from the shore The
clothes floated high and dry but the reeds depressed by the weight
of the body sank so that the head of the convict alone appeared above
water In this fashion he gained the middle of the current and the
outgoing tide swept him down towards the mouth of the harbour

Frere sulkily admiring went back to prepare the breakfastthey were
on half rations now Dawes having forbidden the slaughtered goat to be
eaten lest his expedition should prove unsuccessfulwondering at the
chance which had thrown this convict in his way Parsons would call it
a special providence he said to himself For if it hadnt been for
him we should never have got thus far If his boat succeeds were
all right I suppose Hes a clever dog I wonder who he is His
training as a master of convicts made him think how dangerous such a man
would be on a convict station It would be difficult to keep a fellow
of such resources Theyll have to look pretty sharp after him if they
ever get him back he thought Ill have a fine tale to tell of his
ingenuity The conversation of the previous day occurred to him I
promised to ask for a free pardon He wouldnt have it though Too
proud to accept it at my hands Wait until we get back Ill teach him
his place for after all it is his own liberty that he is working for
as well as mineI mean ours Then a thought came into his head that
was in every way worthy of him Suppose we took the boat and left
him behind The notion seemed so ludicrously wicked that he laughed
involuntarily

What is it Mr Frere

Oh its you Sylvia is it Ha ha ha I was thinking of
somethingsomething funny

Indeed said Sylvia I am glad of that Wheres Mr Dawes

Frere was displeased at the interest with which she asked the question

You are always thinking of that fellow Its Dawes Dawes Dawes all
day long He has gone

Oh with a sorrowful accent Mamma wants to see him

What about says Frere roughly Mamma is ill Mr Frere

Dawes isnt a doctor Whats the matter with her

She is worse than she was yesterday I dont know what is the matter

Frere somewhat alarmed strode over to the little cavern

The lady of the Commandant was in a strange plight The cavern was
lofty but narrow In shape it was threecornered having two sides open
to the wind The ingenuity of Rufus Dawes had closed these sides with
wickerwork and clay and a sort of door of interlaced brushwood hung at
one of them Frere pushed open this door and entered The poor woman was
lying on a bed of rushes strewn over young brushwood and was moaning
feebly From the first she had felt the privation to which she was
subjected most keenly and the mental anxiety from which she suffered
increased her physical debility The exhaustion and lassitude to
which she had partially succumbed soon after Dawess arrival had now
completely overcome her and she was unable to rise

Cheer up maam said Maurice with an assumption of heartiness It
will be all right in a day or two

Is it you I sent for Mr Dawes

He is away just now I am making a boat Did not Sylvia tell you

She told me that he was making one

Well Ithat is weare making it He will be back again tonight Can
I do anything for you

No thank you I only wanted to know how he was getting on I must go
soonif I am to go Thank you Mr Frere I am much obliged to you
This is aheedreadful place to have visitors isnt it

Never mind said Frere again you will be back in Hobart Town in a
few days now We are sure to get picked up by a ship But you must cheer
up Have some tea or something

No thank youI dont feel well enough to eat I am tired

Sylvia began to cry

Dont cry dear I shall be better by and by Oh I wish Mr Dawes was
back

Maurice Frere went out indignant This Mr Dawes was everybody it
seemed and he was nobody Let them wait a little All that day working
hard to carry out the convicts directions he meditated a thousand
plans by which he could turn the tables He would accuse Dawes
of violence He would demand that he should be taken back as an
absconder He would insist that the law should take its course and
that the death which was the doom of all who were caught in the act of
escape from a penal settlement should be enforced Yet if they got safe
to land the marvellous courage and ingenuity of the prisoner would tell
strongly in his favour The woman and child would bear witness to his
tenderness and skill and plead for him As he had said the convict
deserved a pardon The mean bad man burning with wounded vanity and
undefined jealousy waited for some method to suggest itself by which
he might claim the credit of the escape and snatch from the prisoner
who had dared to rival him the last hope of freedom

Rufus Dawes drifting with the current had allowed himself to coast
along the eastern side of the harbour until the Pilot Station appeared
in view on the opposite shore By this time it was nearly seven oclock
He landed at a sandy cove and drawing up his raft proceeded to unpack
from among his garments a piece of damper Having eaten sparingly and
dried himself in the sun he replaced the remains of his breakfast
and pushed his floats again into the water The Pilot Station lay some
distance below him on the opposite shore He had purposely made
his second start from a point which would give him this advantage of
position for had he attempted to paddle across at right angles the
strength of the current would have swept him out to sea Weak as he was
he several times nearly lost his hold on the reeds The clumsy bundle
presenting too great a broadside to the stream whirled round and
round and was once or twice nearly sucked under At length however
breathless and exhausted he gained the opposite bank half a mile below
the point he had attempted to make and carrying his floats out of reach
of the tide made off across the hill to the Pilot Station

Arrived there about midday he set to work to lay his snares The
goats with whose hides he hoped to cover the coracle were sufficiently
numerous and tame to encourage him to use every exertion He carefully
examined the tracks of the animals and found that they converged to
one pointthe track to the nearest water With much labour he cut down
bushes so as to mask the approach to the waterhole on all sides save
where these tracks immediately conjoined Close to the water and at
unequal distances along the various tracks he scattered the salt he had
obtained by his rude distillation of seawater Between this scattered
salt and the points where he judged the animals would be likely to
approach he set his traps made after the following manner He took
several pliant branches of young trees and having stripped them of
leaves and twigs dug with his knife and the end of the rude paddle he
had made for the voyage across the inlet a succession of holes about a
foot deep At the thicker end of these saplings he fastened by a piece
of fishing line a small crossbar which swung loosely like the stick
handle which a schoolboy fastens to the string of his pegtop Forcing
the ends of the saplings thus prepared into the holes he filled in and
stamped down the earth all around them The saplings thus anchored as
it were by the crosspieces of stick not only stood firm but resisted
all his efforts to withdraw them To the thin ends of these saplings
he bound tightly into notches cut in the wood and secured by a
multiplicity of twisting the catgut springes he had brought from the
camping ground The saplings were then bent double and the gutted ends
secured in the ground by the same means as that employed to fix the
butts This was the most difficult part of the business for it was
necessary to discover precisely the amount of pressure that would hold
the bent rod without allowing it to escape by reason of this elasticity
and which would yet give to a slight pull on the gut After many
failures however this happy medium was discovered and Rufus Dawes
concealing his springes by means of twigs smoothed the disturbed sand
with a branch and retired to watch the effect of his labours About two
hours after he had gone the goats came to drink There were five goats
and two kids and they trotted calmly along the path to the water The
watcher soon saw that his precautions had been in a manner wasted The
leading goat marched gravely into the springe which catching him round
his neck released the bent rod and sprang him off his legs into the
air He uttered a comical bleat and then hung kicking Rufus Dawes
though the success of the scheme was a matter of life and death burst
out laughing at the antics of the beast The other goats bounded off at
this sudden elevation of their leader and three more were entrapped at
a little distance Rufus Dawes now thought it time to secure his prize
though three of the springes were as yet unsprung He ran down to the
old goat knife in hand but before he could reach him the barelydried
catgut gave way and the old fellow shaking his head with grotesque
dismay made off at full speed The others however were secured and
killed The loss of the springe was not a serious one for three traps
remained unsprung and before sundown Rufus Dawes had caught four more
goats Removing with care the catgut that had done such good service he
dragged the carcases to the shore and proceeded to pack them upon his
floats He discovered however that the weight was too great and that
the water entering through the loops of the stitching in the hide had
so soaked the rushgrass as to render the floats no longer buoyant He
was compelled therefore to spend two hours in restuffing the skin
with such material as he could find Some light and flocklike seaweed
which the action of the water had swathed after the fashion of haybands
along the shore formed an excellent substitute for grass and
having bound his bundle of rushes lengthwise with the goatskin as a
centrepiece he succeeded in forming a sort of rude canoe upon which
the carcases floated securely

He had eaten nothing since the morning and the violence of his
exertions had exhausted him Still sustained by the excitement of the
task he had set himself he dismissed with fierce impatience the thought
of rest and dragged his weary limbs along the sand endeavouring to
kill fatigue by further exertion The tide was now running in and he
knew it was imperative that he should regain the further shore while the
current was in his favour To cross from the Pilot Station at low water
was impossible If he waited until the ebb he must spend another day
on the shore and he could not afford to lose an hour Cutting a long
sapling he fastened to one end of it the floating bundle and thus
guided it to a spot where the beach shelved abruptly into deep water
It was a clear night and the risen moon large and low flung a rippling
streak of silver across the sea On the other side of the bay all
was bathed in a violet haze which veiled the inlet from which he had
started in the morning The fire of the exiles hidden behind a point
of rock cast a red glow into the air The ocean breakers rolled in upon
the cliffs outside the bar with a hoarse and threatening murmur and
the rising tide rippled and lapped with treacherous melody along the
sand He touched the chill water and drew back For an instant he
determined to wait until the beams of morning should illumine that
beautiful but treacherous sea and then the thought of the helpless
child who was without doubt waiting and watching for him on the
shore gave new strength to his wearied frame and fixing his eyes on
the glow that hovering above the dark treeline marked her presence
he pushed the raft before him out into the sea The reeds sustained
him bravely but the strength of the current sucked him underneath the
water and for several seconds he feared that he should be compelled
to let go his hold But his muscles steeled in the slow fire
of convictlabour withstood this last strain upon them and
halfsuffocated with bursting chest and paralysed fingers he preserved
his position until the mass getting out of the eddies along the
shoreline drifted steadily down the silvery track that led to the
settlement After a few moments rest he set his teeth and urged his
strange canoe towards the shore Paddling and pushing he gradually
edged it towards the firelight and at last just when his stiffened
limbs refused to obey the impulse of his will and he began to drift
onwards with the onward tide he felt his feet strike firm ground
Opening his eyesclosed in the desperation of his last effortshe
found himself safe under the lee of the rugged promontory which hid
the fire It seemed that the waves tired of persecuting him had with
disdainful pity cast him ashore at the goal of his hopes Looking back
he for the first time realized the frightful peril he had escaped and
shuddered To this shudder succeeded a thrill of triumph Why had he
stayed so long when escape was so easy Dragging the carcases above
highwater mark he rounded the little promontory and made for the fire
The recollection of the night when he had first approached it came upon
him and increased his exultation How different a man was he now from
then Passing up the sand he saw the stakes which he had directed Frere
to cut whiten in the moonshine His officer worked for him In his own
brain alone lay the secret of escape HeRufus Dawesthe scarred
degraded prisoner could alone get these three beings back to
civilization Did he refuse to aid them they would for ever remain in
that prison where he had so long suffered The tables were turnedhe
had become a gaoler He had gained the fire before the solitary watcher
there heard his footsteps and spread his hands to the blaze in silence
He felt as Frere would have felt had their positions been reversed
disdainful of the man who had stopped at home

Frere starting cried It is you Have you succeeded

Rufus Dawes nodded

What Did you catch them

There are four carcases down by the rocks You can have meat for
breakfast tomorrow

The child at the sound of the voice came running down from the hut
Oh Mr Dawes I am so glad We were beginning to despairmamma and
I

Dawes snatched her from the ground and bursting into a joyous laugh
swung her into the air Tell me he cried holding up the child with
two dripping arms above him what you will do for me if I bring you and
mamma safe home again

Give you a free pardon says Sylvia and papa shall make you his
servant Frere burst out laughing at this reply and Dawes with a
choking sensation in his throat put the child upon the ground and
walked away

This was in truth all he could hope for All his scheming all his
courage all his peril would but result in the patronage of a great man
like Major Vickers His heart big with love with selfdenial and with
hopes of a fair future would have this flattering unction laid to it
He had performed a prodigy of skill and daring and for his reward he
was to be made a servant to the creatures he had protected Yet what
more could a convict expect Sylvia saw how deeply her unconscious hand
had driven the iron and ran up to the man she had wounded And Mr
Dawes remember that I shall love you always The convict however his
momentary excitement over motioned her away and she saw him stretch
himself wearily under the shadow of a rock




CHAPTER XV THE CORACLE



In the morning however Rufus Dawes was first at work and made no
allusion to the scene of the previous evening He had already skinned
one of the goats and he directed Frere to set to work upon another
Cut down the rump to the hock and down the brisket to the knee he
said I want the hides as square as possible By dint of hard work
they got the four goats skinned and the entrails cleaned ready for
twisting by breakfast time and having broiled some of the flesh made
a hearty meal Mrs Vickers being no better Dawes went to see her and
seemed to have made friends again with Sylvia for he came out of the
hut with the childs hand in his Frere who was cutting the meat in
long strips to dry in the sun saw this and it added fresh fuel to the
fire in his unreasonable envy and jealousy However he said nothing
for his enemy had not yet shown him how the boat was to be made Before
midday however he was a partner in the secret which after all was a
very simple one

Rufus Dawes took two of the straightest and most tapered of the
celerytop pines which Frere had cut on the previous day and lashed
them tightly together with the butts outwards He thus produced a
spliced stick about twelve feet long About two feet from either end he
notched the young tree until he could bend the extremities upwards and
having so bent them he secured the bent portions in their places by
means of lashings of raw hide The spliced trees now presented a rude
outline of the section of a boat having the stem keel and stern all
in one piece This having been placed lengthwise between the stakes
four other poles notched in two places were lashed from stake to
stake running crosswise to the keel and forming the knees Four
saplings were now bent from end to end of the upturned portions of the
keel that represented stem and stern Two of these four were placed
above as gunwales two below as bottom rails At each intersection the
sticks were lashed firmly with fishing line The whole framework being
complete the stakes were drawn out and there lay upon the ground the
skeleton of a boat eight feet long by three broad

Frere whose hands were blistered and sore would fain have rested but
the convict would not hear of it Let us finish he said regardless of
his own fatigue the skins will be dry if we stop

I can work no more says Frere sulkily I cant stand Youve got
muscles of iron I suppose I havent

They made me work when I couldnt stand Maurice Frere It is wonderful
what spirit the cat gives a man Theres nothing like work to get rid of
aching musclesso they used to tell me

Well whats to be done now

Cover the boat There you can set the fat to melt and sew these hides
together Two and two do you see and then sew the pair at the necks
There is plenty of catgut yonder

Dont talk to me as if I was a dog says Frere suddenly Be civil
cant you

But the other busily trimming and cutting at the projecting pieces
of sapling made no reply It is possible that he thought the fatigued
lieutenant beneath his notice About an hour before sundown the hides
were ready and Rufus Dawes having in the meantime interlaced the ribs
of the skeleton with wattles stretched the skins over it with the
hairy side inwards Along the edges of this covering he bored holes at
intervals and passing through these holes thongs of twisted skin
he drew the whole to the top rail of the boat One last precaution
remained Dipping the pannikin into the melted tallow he plentifully
anointed the seams of the sewn skins The boat thus turned topsyturvy
looked like a huge walnut shell covered with red and reeking hide
or the skull of some Titan who had been scalped There cried Rufus
Dawes triumphant Twelve hours in the sun to tighten the hides and
shell swim like a duck

The next day was spent in minor preparations The jerked goatmeat was
packed securely into as small a compass as possible The rum barrel was
filled with water and water bags were improvised out of portions of
the intestines of the goats Rufus Dawes having filled these last with
water ran a wooden skewer through their mouths and twisted it tight
tourniquet fashion He also stripped cylindrical pieces of bark and
having sewn each cylinder at the side fitted to it a bottom of the same
material and caulked the seams with gum and pinetree resin Thus four
tolerable buckets were obtained One goatskin yet remained and out of
that it was determined to make a sail The currents are strong said
Rufus Dawes and we shall not be able to row far with such oars as we
have got If we get a breeze it may save our lives It was impossible
to step a mast in the frail basket structure but this difficulty was
overcome by a simple contrivance From thwart to thwart two poles were
bound and the mast lashed between these poles with thongs of raw hide
was secured by shrouds of twisted fishing line running fore and aft
Sheets of bark were placed at the bottom of the craft and made a safe
flooring It was late in the afternoon on the fourth day when these
preparations were completed and it was decided that on the morrow they
should adventure the journey We will coast down to the Bar said
Rufus Dawes and wait for the slack of the tide I can do no more now

Sylvia who had seated herself on a rock at a little distance called
to them Her strength was restored by the fresh meat and her childish
spirits had risen with the hope of safety The mercurial little creature
had wreathed seaweed about her head and holding in her hand a long twig
decorated with a tuft of leaves to represent a wand she personified one
of the heroines of her books

I am the Queen of the Island she said merrily and you are my
obedient subjects Pray Sir Eglamour is the boat ready

It is your Majesty said poor Dawes

Then we will see it Come walk in front of me I wont ask you to
rub your nose upon the ground like Man Friday because that would be
uncomfortable Mr Frere you dont play

Oh yes says Frere unable to withstand the charming pout that
accompanied the words Ill play What am I to do

You must walk on this side and be respectful Of course it is only
Pretend you know she added with a quick consciousness of Freres
conceit Now then the Queen goes down to the Seashore surrounded by
her Nymphs There is no occasion to laugh Mr Frere Of course Nymphs
are very different from you but then we cant help that

Marching in this pathetically ridiculous fashion across the sand they
halted at the coracle So that is the boat says the Queen fairly
surprised out of her assumption of dignity You are a Wonderful Man
Mr Dawes

Rufus Dawes smiled sadly It is very simple

Do you call this simple says Frere who in the general joy had
shaken off a portion of his sulkiness By George I dont This is
shipbuilding with a vengeance this is Theres no scheming about
thisits all sheer hard work

Yes echoed Sylvia sheer hard worksheer hard work by good Mr
Dawes And she began to sing a childish chant of triumph drawing lines
and letters in the sand the while with the sceptre of the Queen

Good Mr Dawes Good Mr Dawes This is the work of Good Mr Dawes

Maurice could not resist a sneer

Seesaw Margery Daw Sold her bed and lay upon straw said he

Good Mr Dawes repeated Sylvia Good Mr Dawes Why shouldnt I say
it You are disagreeable sir I wont play with you any more and she
went off along the sand

Poor little child said Rufus Dawes You speak too harshly to her

Frerenow that the boat was madehad regained his selfconfidence
Civilization seemed now brought sufficiently close to him to warrant his
assuming the position of authority to which his social position entitled
him One would think that a boat had never been built before to hear
her talk he said If this washingbasket had been one of my old
uncles threedeckers she couldnt have said much more By the Lord
he added with a coarse laugh I ought to have a natural talent for
shipbuilding for if the old villain hadnt died when he did I should
have been a shipbuilder myself

Rufus Dawes turned his back at the word died and busied himself with
the fastenings of the hides Could the other have seen his face he
would have been struck by its sudden pallor

Ah continued Frere half to himself and half to his companion
thats a sum of money to lose isnt it

What do you mean asked the convict without turning his face

Mean Why my good fellow I should have been left a quarter of a
million of money but the old hunks who was going to give it to me died
before he could alter his will and every shilling went to a scapegrace
son who hadnt been near the old man for years Thats the way of the
world isnt it

Rufus Dawes still keeping his face away caught his breath as if in
astonishment and then recovering himself he said in a harsh voice A
fortunate fellowthat son

Fortunate cries Frere with another oath Oh yes he was fortunate
He was burnt to death in the Hydaspes and never heard of his luck His
mother has got the money though I never saw a shilling of it And
then seemingly displeased with himself for having allowed his tongue
to get the better of his dignity he walked away to the fire musing
doubtless on the difference between Maurice Frere with a quarter of a
million disporting himself in the best society that could be procured
with command of dogcarts prizefighters and gamecocks galore and
Maurice Frere a penniless lieutenant marooned on the barren coast of
Macquarie Harbour and acting as boatbuilder to a runaway convict

Rufus Dawes was also lost in reverie He leant upon the gunwale of
the muchvaunted boat and his eyes were fixed upon the sea weltering
golden in the sunset but it was evident that he saw nothing of the
scene before him Struck dumb by the sudden intelligence of his fortune
his imagination escaped from his control and fled away to those
scenes which he had striven so vainly to forget He was looking far
awayacross the glittering harbour and the wide sea beyond itlooking
at the old house at Hampstead with its wellremembered gloomy garden
He pictured himself escaped from this present peril and freed from the
sordid thraldom which so long had held him He saw himself returning
with some plausible story of his wanderings to take possession of the
wealth which was hissaw himself living once more rich free and
respected in the world from which he had been so long an exile He saw
his mothers sweet pale face the light of a happy home circle He saw
himselfreceived with tears of joy and marvelling affectionentering
into this home circle as one risen from the dead A new life opened
radiant before him and he was lost in the contemplation of his own
happiness

So absorbed was he that he did not hear the light footstep of the child
across the sand Mrs Vickers having been told of the success which had
crowned the convicts efforts had overcome her weakness so far as
to hobble down the beach to the boat and now heralded by Sylvia
approached leaning on the arm of Maurice Frere

Mamma has come to see the boat Mr Dawes cries Sylvia but Dawes did
not hear

The child reiterated her words but still the silent figure did not
reply

Mr Dawes she cried again and pulled him by the coatsleeve

The touch aroused him and looking down he saw the pretty thin face
upturned to his Scarcely conscious of what he did and still following
out the imagining which made him free wealthy and respected he
caught the little creature in his armsas he might have caught his own
daughterand kissed her Sylvia said nothing but Mr Frerearrived
by his chain of reasoning at quite another conclusion as to the state
of affairswas astonished at the presumption of the man The lieutenant
regarded himself as already reinstated in his old position and with
Mrs Vickers on his arm reproved the apparent insolence of the convict
as freely as he would have done had they both been at his own little
kingdom of Maria Island You insolent beggar he cried Do you dare
Keep your place sir

The sentence recalled Rufus Dawes to reality His place was that of a
convict What business had he with tenderness for the daughter of his
master Yet after all he had done and proposed to do this harsh
judgment upon him seemed cruel He saw the two looking at the boat he
had built He marked the flush of hope on the cheek of the poor lady
and the fullblown authority that already hardened the eye of Maurice
Frere and all at once he understood the result of what he had done He
had by his own act given himself again to bondage As long as escape
was impracticable he had been useful and even powerful Now he had
pointed out the way of escape he had sunk into the beast of burden once
again In the desert he was Mr Dawes the saviour in civilized life
he would become once more Rufus Dawes the ruffian the prisoner the
absconder He stood mute and let Frere point out the excellences of the
craft in silence and then feeling that the few words of thanks uttered
by the lady were chilled by her consciousness of the illadvised freedom
he had taken with the child he turned on his heel and strode up into
the bush

A queer fellow said Frere as Mrs Vickers followed the retreating
figure with her eyes Always in an ill temper Poor man He has
behaved very kindly to us said Mrs Vickers Yet even she felt the
change of circumstance and knew that without any reason she could
name her blind trust and hope in the convict who had saved their lives
had been transformed into a patronizing kindliness which was quite
foreign to esteem or affection

Come let us have some supper says Frere The last we shall eat
here I hope He will come back when his fit of sulks is over

But he did not come back and after a few expressions of wonder at his
absence Mrs Vickers and her daughter rapt in the hopes and fears
of the morrow almost forgot that he had left them With marvellous
credulity they looked upon the terrible stake they were about to
play for as already won The possession of the boat seemed to them so
wonderful that the perils of the voyage they were to make in it were
altogether lost sight of As for Maurice Frere he was rejoiced that
the convict was out of the way He wished that he was out of the way
altogether




CHAPTER XVI THE WRITING ON THE SAND



Having got out of eyeshot of the ungrateful creatures he had
befriended Rufus Dawes threw himself upon the ground in an agony of
mingled rage and regret For the first time for six years he had tasted
the happiness of doing good the delight of selfabnegation For the
first time for six years he had broken through the selfish misanthropy
he had taught himself And this was his reward He had held his temper
in check in order that it might not offend others He had banished the
galling memory of his degradation lest haply some shadow of it might
seem to fall upon the fair child whose lot had been so strangely cast
with his He had stifled the agony he suffered lest its expression
should give pain to those who seemed to feel for him He had forborne
retaliation when retaliation would have been most sweet Having all
these years waited and watched for a chance to strike his persecutors
he had held his hand now that an unlookedfor accident had placed the
weapon of destruction in his grasp He had risked his life forgone his
enmities almost changed his natureand his reward was cold looks and
harsh words so soon as his skill had paved the way to freedom
This knowledge coming upon him while the thrill of exultation at the
astounding news of his riches yet vibrated in his brain made him
grind his teeth with rage at his own hard fate Bound by the purest and
holiest of tiesthe affection of a son to his motherhe had condemned
himself to social death rather than buy his liberty and life by a
revelation which would shame the gentle creature whom he loved By a
strange series of accidents fortune had assisted him to maintain the
deception he had practised His cousin had not recognized him The very
ship in which he was believed to have sailed had been lost with every
soul on board His identity had been completely destroyedno link
remained which could connect Rufus Dawes the convict with Richard
Devine the vanished heir to the wealth of the dead shipbuilder

Oh if he had only known If while in the gloomy prison distracted by
a thousand fears and weighed down by crushing evidence of circumstance
he had but guessed that death had stepped between Sir Richard and his
vengeance he might have spared himself the sacrifice he had made He
had been tried and condemned as a nameless sailor who could call no
witnesses in his defence and give no particulars as to his previous
history It was clear to him now that he might have adhered to his
statement of ignorance concerning the murder locked in his breast
the name of the murderer and have yet been free Judges are just but
popular opinion is powerful and it was not impossible that Richard
Devine the millionaire would have escaped the fate which had overtaken
Rufus Dawes the sailor Into his calculations in the prisonwhen
halfcrazed with love with terror and despair he had counted up his
chances of lifethe wild supposition that he had even then inherited
the wealth of the father who had disowned him had never entered The
knowledge of that fact would have altered the whole current of his life
and he learnt it for the first time nowtoo late Now lying prone upon
the sand now wandering aimlessly up and down among the stunted trees
that bristled white beneath the mistbarred moon now sittingas he
had sat in the prison long agowith the head gripped hard between his
hands swaying his body to and fro he thought out the frightful problem
of his bitter life Of little use was the heritage that he had gained A
convictabsconder whose hands were hard with menial service and whose
back was scarred with the lash could never be received among the gently
nurtured Let him lay claim to his name and rights what then He was a
convicted felon and his name and rights had been taken from him by the
law Let him go and tell Maurice Frere that he was his lost cousin He
would be laughed at Let him proclaim aloud his birth and innocence and
the convictsheds would grin and the convict overseer set him to
harder labour Let him even by dint of reiteration get his wild story
believed what would happen If it was heard in Englandafter the
lapse of years perhapsthat a convict in the chaingang in Macquarie
Harboura man held to be a murderer and whose convict career was
one long record of mutiny and punishmentclaimed to be the heir to an
English fortune and to own the right to dispossess staid and worthy
English folk of their rank and station with what feeling would the
announcement be received Certainly not with a desire to redeem this
ruffian from his bonds and place him in the honoured seat of his dead
father Such intelligence would be regarded as a calamity an unhappy
blot upon a fair reputation a disgrace to an honoured and unsullied
name Let him succeed let him return again to the mother who had by
this time become reconciled in a measure to his loss he would at the
best be to her a living shame scarcely less degrading than that which
she had dreaded

But success was almost impossible He did not dare to retrace his steps
through the hideous labyrinth into which he had plunged Was he to show
his scarred shoulders as a proof that he was a gentleman and an innocent
man Was he to relate the nameless infamies of Macquarie Harbour as a
proof that he was entitled to receive the hospitalities of the generous
and to sit a respected guest at the tables of men of refinement Was
he to quote the horrible slang of the prisonship and retail the filthy
jests of the chaingang and the hulks as a proof that he was a fit
companion for pureminded women and innocent children Suppose even
that he could conceal the name of the real criminal and show himself
guiltless of the crime for which he had been condemned all the wealth
in the world could not buy back that blissful ignorance of evil which
had once been his All the wealth in the world could not purchase the
selfrespect which had been cut out of him by the lash or banish from
his brain the memory of his degradation

For hours this agony of thought racked him He cried out as though with
physical pain and then lay in a stupor exhausted with actual physical
suffering It was hopeless to think of freedom and of honour Let him
keep silence and pursue the life fate had marked out for him He would
return to bondage The law would claim him as an absconder and would
mete out to him such punishment as was fitting Perhaps he might escape
severest punishment as a reward for his exertions in saving the child
He might consider himself fortunate if such was permitted to him
Fortunate Suppose he did not go back at all but wandered away into the
wilderness and died Better death than such a doom as his Yet need he
die He had caught goats he could catch fish He could build a hut
In here was perchance at the deserted settlement some remnant of seed
corn that planted would give him bread He had built a boat he had
made an oven he had fenced in a hut Surely he could contrive to live
alone savage and free Alone He had contrived all these marvels alone
Was not the boat he himself had built below upon the shore Why not
escape in her and leave to their fate the miserable creatures who had
treated him with such ingratitude

The idea flashed into his brain as though someone had spoken the words
into his ear Twenty strides would place him in possession of the boat
and half an hours drifting with the current would take him beyond
pursuit Once outside the Bar he would make for the westward in the
hopes of falling in with some whaler He would doubtless meet with one
before many days and he was well supplied with provision and water in
the meantime A tale of shipwreck would satisfy the sailors andhe
pausedhe had forgotten that the rags which he wore would betray him
With an exclamation of despair he started from the posture in which
he was lying He thrust out his hands to raise himself and his fingers
came in contact with something soft He had been lying at the foot of
some loose stones that were piled cairnwise beside a lowgrowing bush
and the object that he had touched was protruding from beneath these
stones He caught it and dragged it forth It was the shirt of poor
Bates With trembling hands he tore away the stones and pulled forth
the rest of the garments They seemed as though they had been left
purposely for him Heaven had sent him the very disguise he needed

The night had passed during his reverie and the first faint streaks of
dawn began to lighten in the sky Haggard and pale he rose to his feet
and scarcely daring to think about what he proposed to do ran towards
the boat As he ran however the voice that he had heard encouraged
him Your life is of more importance than theirs They will die but
they have been ungrateful and deserve death You will escape out of this
Hell and return to the loving heart who mourns you You can do more
good to mankind than by saving the lives of these people who despise
you Moreover they may not die They are sure to be sent for Think of
what awaits you when you returnan absconded convict

He was within three feet of the boat when he suddenly checked himself
and stood motionless staring at the sand with as much horror as though
he saw there the Writing which foretold the doom of Belshazzar He
had come upon the sentence traced by Sylvia the evening before and
glittering in the low light of the red sun suddenly risen from out the
sea it seemed to him that the letters had shaped themselves at his very
feet

GOOD MR DAWES

Good Mr Dawes What a frightful reproach there was to him in that
simple sentence What a world of cowardice baseness and cruelty had
not those eleven letters opened to him He heard the voice of the child
who had nursed him calling on him to save her He saw her at that
instant standing between him and the boat as she had stood when she
held out to him the loaf on the night of his return to the settlement

He staggered to the cavern and seizing the sleeping Frere by the arm
shook him violently Awake awake he cried and let us leave this
place Frere starting to his feet looked at the white face and
bloodshot eyes of the wretched man before him with blunt astonishment
Whats the matter with you man he said You look as if youd seen a
ghost

At the sound of his voice Rufus Dawes gave a long sigh and drew his
hand across his eyes

Come Sylvia shouted Frere Its time to get up I am ready to go

The sacrifice was complete The convict turned away and two great
glistening tears rolled down his rugged face and fell upon the sand




CHAPTER XVII AT SEA



An hour after sunrise the frail boat which was the last hope of these
four human beings drifted with the outgoing current towards the mouth
of the harbour When first launched she had come nigh swamping being
overloaded and it was found necessary to leave behind a great portion
of the dried meat With what pangs this was done can be easily imagined
for each atom of food seemed to represent an hour of life Yet there was
no help for it As Frere said it was neck or nothing with them They
must get away at all hazards

That evening they camped at the mouth of the Gates Dawes being afraid
to risk a passage until the slack of the tide and about ten oclock
at night adventured to cross the Bar The night was lovely and the
sea calm It seemed as though Providence had taken pity on them for
notwithstanding the insecurity of the craft and the violence of the
breakers the dreaded passage was made with safety Once indeed when
they had just entered the surf a mighty wave curling high above them
seemed about to overwhelm the frail structure of skins and wickerwork
but Rufus Dawes keeping the nose of the boat to the sea and Frere
baling with his hat they succeeded in reaching deep water A great
misfortune however occurred Two of the bark buckets left by some
unpardonable oversight uncleated were washed overboard and with
them nearly a fifth of their scanty store of water In the face of
the greater peril the accident seemed trifling and as drenched and
chilled they gained the open sea they could not but admit that fortune
had almost miraculously befriended them

They made tedious way with their rude oars a light breeze from the
northwest sprang up with the dawn and hoisting the goatskin sail
they crept along the coast It was resolved that the two men should keep
watch and watch and Frere for the second time enforced his authority by
giving the first watch to Rufus Dawes I am tired he said and shall
sleep for a little while

Rufus Dawes who had not slept for two nights and who had done all the
harder work said nothing He had suffered so much during the last two
days that his senses were dulled to pain

Frere slept until late in the afternoon and when he woke found the
boat still tossing on the sea and Sylvia and her mother both seasick
This seemed strange to him Seasickness appeared to be a malady which
belonged exclusively to civilization Moodily watching the great green
waves which curled incessantly between him and the horizon he marvelled
to think how curiously events had come about A leaf had as it were
been torn out of his autobiography It seemed a lifetime since he had
done anything but moodily scan the sea or shore Yet on the morning of
leaving the settlement he had counted the notches on a calendarstick
he carried and had been astonished to find them but twentytwo in
number Taking out his knife he cut two nicks in the wicker gunwale of
the coracle That brought him to twentyfour days The mutiny had taken
place on the 13th of January it was now the 6th of February Surely
thought he the Ladybird might have returned by this time There was
no one to tell him that the Ladybird had been driven into Port Davey by
stress of weather and detained there for seventeen days

That night the wind fell and they had to take to their oars Rowing
all night they made but little progress and Rufus Dawes suggested that
they should put in to the shore and wait until the breeze sprang up
But upon getting under the lee of a long line of basaltic rocks which
rose abruptly out of the sea they found the waves breaking furiously
upon a horseshoe reef six or seven miles in length There was nothing
for it but to coast again They coasted for two days without a sign
of a sail and on the third day a great wind broke upon them from the
southeast and drove them back thirty miles The coracle began to leak
and required constant bailing What was almost as bad the rum cask
that held the best part of their water had leaked also and was now
half empty They caulked it by cutting out the leak and then plugging
the hole with linen

Its lucky we aint in the tropics said Frere Poor Mrs Vickers
lying in the bottom of the boat wrapped in her wet shawl and chilled
to the bone with the bitter wind had not the heart to speak Surely
the stifling calm of the tropics could not be worse than this bleak and
barren sea

The position of the four poor creatures was now almost desperate Mrs
Vickers indeed seemed completely prostrated and it was evident that
unless some help came she could not long survive the continued exposure
to the weather The child was in somewhat better case Rufus Dawes had
wrapped her in his woollen shirt and unknown to Frere had divided
with her daily his allowance of meat She lay in his arms at night and
in the day crept by his side for shelter and protection As long as she
was near him she felt safe They spoke little to each other but when
Rufus Dawes felt the pressure of her tiny hand in his or sustained the
weight of her head upon his shoulder he almost forgot the cold that
froze him and the hunger that gnawed him

So two more days passed and yet no sail On the tenth day after
their departure from Macquarie Harbour they came to the end of their
provisions The salt water had spoiled the goatmeat and soaked the
bread into a nauseous paste The sea was still running high and the
wind having veered to the north was blowing with increased violence
The long low line of coast that stretched upon their left hand was at
times obscured by a blue mist The water was the colour of mud and
the sky threatened rain The wretched craft to which they had entrusted
themselves was leaking in four places If caught in one of the frequent
storms which ravaged that ironbound coast she could not live an hour
The two men wearied hungry and cold almost hoped for the end to come
quickly To add to their distress the child was seized with fever
She was hot and cold by turns and in the intervals of moaning talked
deliriously Rufus Dawes holding her in his arms watched the suffering
he was unable to alleviate with a savage despair at his heart Was she
to die after all

So another day and night passed and the eleventh morning saw the boat
yet alive rolling in the trough of the same deserted sea The four
exiles lay in her almost without breath

All at once Dawes uttered a cry and seizing the sheet put the clumsy
craft about A sail a sail he cried Do you not see her

Freres hungry eyes ranged the dull water in vain

There is no sail fool he said You mock us

The boat no longer following the line of the coast was running nearly
due south straight into the great Southern Ocean Frere tried to wrest
the thong from the hand of the convict and bring the boat back to her
course Are you mad he asked in fretful terror to run us out to
sea

Sit down returned the other with a menacing gesture and staring
across the grey water I tell you I see a sail

Frere overawed by the strange light which gleamed in the eyes of his
companion shifted sulkily back to his place Have your own way
he said madman It serves me right for putting off to sea in such a
devils craft as this

After all what did it matter As well be drowned in midocean as in
sight of land

The long day wore out and no sail appeared The wind freshened towards
evening and the boat plunging clumsily on the long brown waves
staggered as though drunk with the water she had swallowed for at one
place near the bows the water ran in and out as through a slit in a wine
skin The coast had altogether disappeared and the huge oceanvast
stormy and threateningheaved and hissed all around them It seemed
impossible that they should live until morning But Rufus Dawes with
his eyes fixed on some object visible alone to him hugged the child in
his arms and drove the quivering coracle into the black waste of night
and sea To Frere sitting sullenly in the bows the aspect of this grim
immovable figure with its backblown hair and staring eyes had in it
something supernatural and horrible He began to think that privation
and anxiety had driven the unhappy convict mad

Thinking and shuddering over his fate he fellas it seemed to
himinto a momentary sleep in the midst of which someone called to
him He started up with shaking knees and bristling hair The day had
broken and the dawn in one long pale streak of sickly saffron lay low
on the left hand Between this streak of saffroncoloured light and the
bows of the boat gleamed for an instant a white speck

A sail a sail cried Rufus Dawes a wild light gleaming in his eyes
and a strange tone vibrating in his voice Did I not tell you that I
saw a sail

Frere utterly confounded looked again with his heart in his mouth
and again did the white speck glimmer For an instant he felt almost
safe and then a blanker despair than before fell upon him From the
distance at which she was it was impossible for the ship to sight the
boat

They will never see us he cried DawesDawes Do you hear They
will never see us

Rufus Dawes started as if from a trance Lashing the sheet to the pole
which served as a gunwale he laid the sleeping child by her mother and
tearing up the strip of bark on which he had been sitting moved to the
bows of the boat

They will see this Tear up that board So Now place it thus across
the bows Hack off that sapling end Now that dry twist of osier Never
mind the boat man we can afford to leave her now Tear off that outer
strip of hide See the wood beneath is dry Quickyou are so slow

What are you going to do cried Frere aghast as the convict tore
up all the dry wood he could find and heaped it on the sheet of bark
placed on the bows

To make a fire See

Frere began to comprehend I have three matches left he said
fumbling with trembling fingers in his pocket I wrapped them in one
of the leaves of the book to keep them dry

The word book was a new inspiration Rufus Dawes seized upon the
English History which had already done such service tore out the drier
leaves in the middle of the volume and carefully added them to the
little heap of touchwood

Now steady

The match was struck and lighted The paper after a few obstinate
curlings caught fire and Frere blowing the young flame with his
breath the bark began to burn He piled upon the fire all that was
combustible the hides began to shrivel and a great column of black
smoke rose up over the sea

Sylvia cried Rufus Dawes Sylvia My darling You are saved

She opened her blue eyes and looked at him but gave no sign of
recognition Delirium had hold of her and in the hour of safety the
child had forgotten her preserver Rufus Dawes overcome by this last
cruel stroke of fortune sat down in the stern of the boat with the
child in his arms speechless Frere feeding the fire thought that the
chance he had so longed for had come With the mother at the point
of death and the child delirious who could testify to this hated
convicts skilfulness No one but Mr Maurice Frere and Mr Maurice
Frere as Commandant of convicts could not but give up an absconder
to justice

The ship changed her course and came towards this strange fire in the
middle of the ocean The boat the fore part of her blazing like a pine
torch could not float above an hour The little group of the convict
and the child remained motionless Mrs Vickers was lying senseless
ignorant even of the approaching succour

The shipa brig with American colours flyingcame within hail of
them Frere could almost distinguish figures on her deck He made his
way aft to where Dawes was sitting unconscious with the child in his
arms and stirred him roughly with his foot

Go forward he said in tones of command and give the child to me

Rufus Dawes raised his head and seeing the approaching vessel awoke
to the consciousness of his duty With a low laugh full of unutterable
bitterness he placed the burden he had borne so tenderly in the arms of
the lieutenant and moved to the blazing bows


     


The brig was close upon them Her canvas loomed large and dusky
shadowing the sea Her wet decks shone in the morning sunlight From her
bulwarks peered bearded and eager faces looking with astonishment at
this burning boat and its haggard company alone on that barren and
stormy ocean

Frere with Sylvia in his arms waited for her



END OF BOOK THE SECOND






BOOK IIIPORT ARTHUR 1838




CHAPTER I A LABOURER IN THE VINEYARD



Society in Hobart Town in this year of grace 1838 is my dear lord
composed of very curious elements So ran a passage in the sparkling
letter which the Rev Mr Meekin newlyappointed chaplain and
sevendays resident in Van Diemens Land was carrying to the post
office for the delectation of his patron in England As the reverend
gentleman tripped daintily down the summer street that lay between the
blue river and the purple mountain he cast his mild eyes hither and
thither upon human nature and the sentence he had just penned recurred
to him with pleasurable appositeness Elbowed by welldressed officers
of garrison bowing sweetly to welldressed ladies shrinking from
illdressed illodoured ticketofleave men or hastening across a
street to avoid being run down by the handcarts that driven by little
gangs of greyclothed convicts rattled and jangled at him unexpectedly
from behind corners he certainly felt that the society through which he
moved was composed of curious elements Now passed with haughty nose in
the air a newlyimported government official relaxing for an instant
his rigidity of demeanour to smile languidly at the chaplain whom
Governor Sir John Franklin delighted to honour now swaggered with
coarse defiance of gentility and patronage a wealthy exprisoner grown
fat on the profits of rum The population that was abroad on that sunny
December afternoon had certainly an incongruous appearance to a dapper
clergyman lately arrived from London and missing for the first time
in his sleek easygoing life those social screens which in London
civilization decorously conceal the frailties and vices of human nature
Clad in glossy black of the most fashionable clerical cut with dandy
boots and gloves of lightest lavendera white silk overcoat hinting
that its wearer was not wholly free from sensitiveness to sun and
heatthe Reverend Meekin tripped daintily to the post office and
deposited his letter Two ladies met him as he turned

Mr Meekin

Mr Meekins elegant hat was raised from his intellectual brow and
hovered in the air like some courteous black bird for an instant
Mrs Jellicoe Mrs Protherick My dear leddies this is an unexpected
pleasure And where pray are you going on this lovely afternoon To
stay in the house is positively sinful Ah what a climatebut
the Trail of the Serpent my dear Mrs Protherickthe Trail of the
Serpent and he sighed

It must be a great trial to you to come to the colony said Mrs
Jellicoe sympathizing with the sigh

Meekin smiled as a gentlemanly martyr might have smiled The Lords
work dear leddiesthe Lords work I am but a poor labourer in the
vineyard toiling through the heat and burden of the day The aspect
of him with his faultless tie his airy coat his natty boots and his
selfsatisfied Christian smile was so unlike a poor labourer toiling
through the heat and burden of the day that good Mrs Jellicoe the
wife of an orthodox Comptroller of Convicts Stores felt a horrible
thrill of momentary heresy I would rather have remained in England
continued Mr Meekin smoothing one lavender finger with the tip of
another and arching his elegant eyebrows in mild deprecation of any
praise of his selfdenial but I felt it my duty not to refuse the
offer made me through the kindness of his lordship Here is a field
leddiesa field for the Christian pastor They appeal to me leddies
these lambs of our Churchthese lost and outcast lambs of our Church

Mrs Jellicoe shook her gay bonnet ribbons at Mr Meekin with a hearty
smile You dont know our convicts she said from the tone of
her jolly voice it might have been our cattle They are horrible
creatures And as for servantsmy goodness I have a fresh one every
week When you have been here a little longer you will know them
better Mr Meekin

They are quite unbearable at times said Mrs Protherick the widow
of a Superintendent of Convicts Barracks with a stately indignation
mantling in her sallow cheeks I am ordinarily the most patient
creature breathing but I do confess that the stupid vicious wretches
that one gets are enough to put a saint out of temper We have all
our crosses dear leddiesall our crosses said the Rev Mr Meekin
piously Heaven send us strength to bear them Goodmorning

Why you are going our way said Mrs Jellicoe We can walk
together

Delighted I am going to call on Major Vickers

And I live within a stones throw returned Mrs Protherick

What a charming little creature she is isnt she

Who asked Mr Meekin as they walked

Sylvia You dont know her Oh a dear little thing

I have only met Major Vickers at Government House said Meekin

I havent yet had the pleasure of seeing his daughter

A sad thing said Mrs Jellicoe Quite a romance if it was not so
sad you know His wife poor Mrs Vickers

Indeed What of her asked Meekin bestowing a condescending bow on a
passerby Is she an invalid

She is dead poor soul returned jolly Mrs Jellicoe with a fat sigh
You dont mean to say you havent heard the story Mr Meekin

My dear leddies I have only been in Hobart Town a week and I have not
heard the story

Its about the mutiny you know the mutiny at Macquarie Harbour
The prisoners took the ship and put Mrs Vickers and Sylvia ashore
somewhere Captain Frere was with them too The poor things had a
dreadful time and nearly died Captain Frere made a boat at last and
they were picked up by a ship Poor Mrs Vickers only lived a few
hours and little Sylviashe was only twelve years old thenwas quite
lightheaded They thought she wouldnt recover

How dreadful And has she recovered

Oh yes shes quite strong now but her memorys gone

Her memory

Yes struck in Mrs Protherick eager to have a share in the
storytelling She doesnt remember anything about the three or four
weeks they were ashoreat least not distinctly

Its a great mercy interrupted Mrs Jellicoe determined to keep the
post of honour Who wants her to remember these horrors From Captain
Freres account it was positively awful

You dont say so said Mr Meekin dabbing his nose with a dainty
handkerchief

A bolterthats what we call an escaped prisoner Mr
Meekinhappened to be left behind and he found them out and insisted
on sharing the provisionsthe wretch Captain Frere was obliged to
watch him constantly for fear he should murder them Even in the boat he
tried to run them out to sea and escape He was one of the worst men
in the Harbour they say but you should hear Captain Frere tell the
story

And where is he now asked Mr Meekin with interest

Captain Frere

No the prisoner

Oh goodness I dont knowat Port Arthur I think I know that he was
tried for bolting and would have been hanged but for Captain Freres
exertions

Dear dear a strange story indeed said Mr Meekin And so the
young lady doesnt know anything about it Only what she has been
told of course poor dear Shes engaged to Captain Frere

Really To the man who saved her How charmingquite a romance

Isnt it Everybody says so And Captain Freres so much older than she
is

But her girlish love clings to her heroic protector said Meekin
mildly poetical Remarkable and beautiful Quite thehemthe ivy
and the oak dear leddies Ah in our fallen nature what sweet spotsI
think this is the gate



A smart convict servanthe had been a pickpocket of note in days gone
byleft the clergyman to repose in a handsomely furnished drawingroom
whose sun blinds revealed a wealth of bright garden flecked with
shadows while he went in search of Miss Vickers The Major was out it
seemed his duties as Superintendent of Convicts rendering such absences
necessary but Miss Vickers was in the garden and could be called in at
once The Reverend Meekin wiping his heated brow and pulling down his
spotless wristbands laid himself back on the soft sofa soothed by the
elegant surroundings no less than by the coolness of the atmosphere
Having no better comparison at hand he compared this luxurious room
with its soft couches brilliant flowers and opened piano to the
chamber in the house of a West India planter where all was glare and
heat and barbarism without and all soft and cool and luxurious within
He was so charmed with this comparisonhe had a knack of being easily
pleased with his own thoughtsthat he commenced to turn a fresh
sentence for the Bishop and to sketch out an elegant description of
the oasis in his desert of a vineyard While at this occupation he was
disturbed by the sound of voices in the garden and it appeared to him
that someone near at hand was sobbing and crying Softly stepping on the
broad verandah he saw on the grassplot two persons an old man and a
young girl The sobbing proceeded from the old man

Deed miss its the truth on my soul Ive but jest come back to yez
this morning O my but its a cruel trick to play an ould man

He was a whitehaired old fellow in a grey suit of convict frieze and
stood leaning with one veiny hand upon the pedestal of a vase of roses

But it is your own fault Danny we all warned you against her said
the young girl softly Sure ye did But oh how did I think it miss
Tis the second time she served me so

How long was it this time Danny

Six months miss She said I was a drunkard and beat her Beat her
God help me stretching forth two trembling hands And they believed
her o course Now when I kem back theres me little place all
thrampled by the boys and shes away wid a ships captain saving your
presence miss dhrinking in the George the Fourth O my but its
hard on an old man and he fell to sobbing again

The girl sighed I can do nothing for you Danny I dare say you can
work about the garden as you did before Ill speak to the Major when he
comes home

Danny lifting his bleared eyes to thank her caught sight of Mr
Meekin and saluted abruptly Miss Vickers turned and Mr Meekin
bowing his apologies became conscious that the young lady was about
seventeen years of age that her eyes were large and soft her hair
plentiful and bright and that the hand which held the little book she
had been reading was white and small

Miss Vickers I think My name is Meekinthe Reverend Arthur Meekin

How do you do Mr Meekin said Sylvia putting out one of her small
hands and looking straight at him Papa will be in directly

His daughter more than compensates for his absence my dear Miss
Vickers

I dont like flattery Mr Meekin so dont use it At least
she added with a delicious frankness that seemed born of her very
brightness and beauty not that sort of flattery Young girls do like
flattery of course Dont you think so

This rapid attack quite disconcerted Mr Meekin and he could only bow
and smile at the selfpossessed young lady Go into the kitchen Danny
and tell them to give you some tobacco Say I sent you Mr Meekin
wont you come in

A strange old gentleman that Miss Vickers A faithful retainer I
presume

An old convict servant of ours said Sylvia He was with papa many
years ago He has got into trouble lately though poor old man

Into trouble asked Mr Meekin as Sylvia took off her hat

On the roads you know Thats what they call it here He married a
free woman much younger than himself and she makes him drink and then
gives him in charge for insubordination

For insubordination Pardon me my dear young lady did I understand
you rightly

Yes insubordination He is her assigned servant you know said
Sylvia as if such a condition of things was the most ordinary in
the world and if he misbehaves himself she sends him back to the
roadgang

The Reverend Mr Meekin opened his mild eyes very wide indeed What
an extraordinary anomaly I am beginning my dear Miss Vickers to find
myself indeed at the antipodes

Society here is different from society in England I believe Most new
arrivals say so returned Sylvia quietly

But for a wife to imprison her husband my dear young lady

She can have him flogged if she likes Danny has been flogged But then
his wife is a bad woman He was very silly to marry her but you cant
reason with an old man in love Mr Meekin

Mr Meekins Christian brow had grown crimson and his decorous blood
tingled to his fingertips To hear a young lady talk in such an open
way was terrible Why in reading the Decalogue from the altar Mr
Meekin was accustomed to soften one indecent prohibition lest
its uncompromising plainness of speech might offend the delicate
sensibilities of his female souls He turned from the dangerous theme
without an instants pause for wonder at the strange power accorded to
Hobart Town free wives You have been reading

Paul et Virginie I have read it before in English

Ah you read French then my dear young lady

Not very well I had a master for some months but papa had to send
him back to the gaol again He stole a silver tankard out of the
diningroom

A French master Stole

He was a prisoner you know A clever man He wrote for the London
Magazine I have read his writings Some of them are quite above the
average

And how did he come to be transported asked Mr Meekin feeling that
his vineyard was getting larger than he had anticipated

Poisoning his niece I think but I forget the particulars He was a
gentlemanly man but oh such a drunkard

Mr Meekin more astonished than ever at this strange country where
beautiful young ladies talked of poisoning and flogging as matters of
little moment where wives imprisoned their husbands and murderers
taught French perfumed the air with his cambric handkerchief in
silence

You have not been here long Mr Meekin said Sylvia after a pause

No only a week and I confess I am surprised A lovely climate but
as I said just now to Mrs Jellicoe the Trail of the Serpentthe Trail
of the Serpentmy dear young lady

If you send all the wretches in England here you must expect the Trail
of the Serpent said Sylvia It isnt the fault of the colony

Oh no certainly not returned Meekin hastening to apologize But
it is very shocking

Well you gentlemen should make it better I dont know what the
penal settlements are like but the prisoners in the town have not much
inducement to become good men

They have the beautiful Liturgy of our Holy Church read to them twice
every week my dear young lady said Mr Meekin as though he should
solemnly say if that doesnt reform them what will

Oh yes returned Sylvia they have that certainly but that is only
on Sundays But dont let us talk about this Mr Meekin she added
pushing back a stray curl of golden hair Papa says that I am not to
talk about these things because they are all done according to the
Rules of the Service as he calls it

An admirable notion of papas said Meekin much relieved as the door
opened and Vickers and Frere entered

Vickerss hair had grown white but Frere carried his thirty years as
easily as some men carry twoandtwenty

My dear Sylvia began Vickers heres an extraordinary thing and
then becoming conscious of the presence of the agitated Meekin he
paused

You know Mr Meekin papa said Sylvia Mr Meekin Captain Frere

I have that pleasure said Vickers Glad to see you sir Pray sit
down Upon which Mr Meekin beheld Sylvia unaffectedly kiss both
gentlemen but became strangely aware that the kiss bestowed upon her
father was warmer than that which greeted her affianced husband

Warm weather Mr Meekin said Frere Sylvia my darling I hope you
have not been out in the heat You have My dear Ive begged you

Its not hot at all said Sylvia pettishly Nonsense Im not made
of butterI shant melt Thank you dear you neednt pull the blind
down And then as though angry with herself for her anger she
added You are always thinking of me Maurice and gave him her hand
affectionately

Its very oppressive Captain Frere said Meekin and to a stranger
quite enervating

Have a glass of wine said Frere as if the house was his own One
wants bucking up a bit on a day like this

Ay to be sure repeated Vickers A glass of wine Sylvia dear some
sherry I hope she has not been attacking you with her strange theories
Mr Meekin

Oh dear no not at all returned Meekin feeling that this charming
young lady was regarded as a creature who was not to be judged by
ordinary rules We got on famously my dear Major

Thats right said Vickers She is very plainspoken is my little
girl and strangers cant understand her sometimes Can they Poppet

Poppet tossed her head saucily I dont know she said Why shouldnt
they But you were going to say something extraordinary when you came
in What is it dear

Ah said Vickers with grave face Yes a most extraordinary thing
Theyve caught those villains

What you dont mean No papa said Sylvia turning round with
alarmed face

In that little family there were for conversational purposes but one
set of villains in the worldthe mutineers of the Osprey

Theyve got four of them in the bay at this momentRex Barker
Shiers and Lesly They are on board the Lady Jane The most
extraordinary story I ever heard in my life The fellows got to China
and passed themselves off as shipwrecked sailors The merchants in
Canton got up a subscription and sent them to London They were
recognized there by old Pine who had been surgeon on board the ship
they came out in

Sylvia sat down on the nearest chair with heightened colour And where
are the others

Two were executed in England the other six have not been taken These
fellows have been sent out for trial

To what are you alluding dear sir asked Meekin eyeing the sherry
with the gaze of a fasting saint

The piracy of a convict brig five years ago replied Vickers The
scoundrels put my poor wife and child ashore and left them to starve
If it hadnt been for FrereGod bless himthey would have died They
shot the pilot and a soldierandbut its a long story

I have heard of it already said Meekin sipping the sherry which
another convict servant had brought for him and of your gallant
conduct Captain Frere

Oh thats nothing said Frere reddening We were all in the same
boat Poppet have a glass of wine

No said Sylvia I dont want any

She was staring at the strip of sunshine between the verandah and
the blind as though the bright light might enable her to remember
something Whats the matter asked Frere bending over her I was
trying to recollect but I cant Maurice It is all confused I only
remember a great shore and a great sea and two men one of whomthats
you dearcarried me in his arms

Dear dear said Mr Meekin

She was quite a baby said Vickers hastily as though unwilling to
admit that her illness had been the cause of her forgetfulness

Oh no I was twelve years old said Sylvia thats not a baby you
know But I think the fever made me stupid

Frere looking at her uneasily shifted in his seat There dont think
about it now he said

Maurice asked she suddenly what became of the other man

Which other man

The man who was with us the other one you know

Poor Bates

No not Bates The prisoner What was his name

Oh ahthe prisoner said Frere as if he too had forgotten

Why you know darling he was sent to Port Arthur

Ah said Sylvia with a shudder And is he there still

I believe so said Frere with a frown

By the by said Vickers I suppose we shall have to get that fellow
up for the trial We have to identify the villains

Cant you and I do that asked Frere uneasily

I am afraid not I wouldnt like to swear to a man after five years

By George said Frere Id swear to him When once I see a mans
facethats enough for me

We had better get up a few prisoners who were at the Harbour at the
time said Vickers as if wishing to terminate the discussion I
wouldnt let the villains slip through my fingers for anything

And are the men at Port Arthur old men asked Meekin

Old convicts returned Vickers Its our place for colonial
sentence men The worst we have are there It has taken the place of
Macquarie Harbour What excitement there will be among them when the
schooner goes down on Monday

Excitement Indeed How charming Why asked Meekin

To bring up the witnesses my dear sir Most of the prisoners are
Lifers you see and a trip to Hobart Town is like a holiday for them

And do they never leave the place when sentenced for life said
Meekin nibbling a biscuit How distressing

Never except when they die answered Frere with a laugh and then
they are buried on an island Oh its a fine place You should come
down with me and have a look at it Mr Meekin Picturesque I can
assure you

My dear Maurice says Sylvia going to the piano as if in protest to
the turn the conversation was taking how can you talk like that

I should much like to see it said Meekin still nibbling for Sir
John was saying something about a chaplaincy there and I understand
that the climate is quite endurable

The convict servant who had entered with some official papers for the
Major stared at the dainty clergyman and rough Maurice laughed again

Oh its a stunning climate he said and nothing to do Just the
place for you Theres a regular little colony there All the scandals
in Van Diemens Land are hatched at Port Arthur

This agreeable chatter about scandal and climate seemed a strange
contrast to the graveyard island and the men who were prisoners for
life Perhaps Sylvia thought so for she struck a few chords which
compelling the party out of sheer politeness to cease talking for the
moment caused the conversation to flag and hinted to Mr Meekin that
it was time for him to depart

Good afternoon dear Miss Vickers he said rising with his sweetest
smile Thank you for your delightful music That piece is an old old
favourite of mine It was quite a favourite of dear Lady Janes and
the Bishops Pray excuse me my dear Captain Frere but this strange
occurrenceof the capture of the wreckers you knowmust be my
apology for touching on a delicate subject How charming to contemplate
Yourself and your dear young lady The preserved and preserver dear
Major None but the brave you know none but the brave none but the
brave deserve the fair You remember glorious John of course Well
good afternoon

Its rather a long invitation said Vickers always well disposed to
anyone who praised his daughter but if youve nothing better to do
come and dine with us on Christmas Day Mr Meekin We usually have a
little gathering then

Charmed said Meekincharmed I am sure It is so refreshing to meet
with persons of ones own tastes in this delightful colony Kindred
souls together knit you know dear Miss Vickers Indeed yes Once
moregood afternoon

Sylvia burst into laughter as the door closed What a ridiculous
creature said she Bless the man with his gloves and his umbrella
and his hair and his scent Fancy that mincing noodle showing me the way
to Heaven Id rather have old Mr Bowes papa though he is as blind as
a beetle and makes you so angry by bottling up his trumps as you call
it

My dear Sylvia said Vickers seriously Mr Meekin is a clergyman
you know

Oh I know said Sylvia but then a clergyman can talk like a man
cant he Why do they send such people here I am sure they could do
much better at home Oh by the way papa dear poor old Dannys come
back again I told him he might go into the kitchen May he dear

Youll have the house full of these vagabonds you little puss said
Vickers kissing her I suppose I must let him stay What has he been
doing now

His wife said Sylvia locked him up you know for being drunk
Wife What do people want with wives I wonder

Ask Maurice said her father smiling

Sylvia moved away and tossed her head

What does he know about it Maurice you are a great bear and if you
hadnt saved my life you know I shouldnt love you a bit There you
may kiss me her voice grew softer This convict business has brought
it all back and I should be ungrateful if I didnt love you dear

Maurice Frere with suddenly crimsoned face accepted the proffered
caress and then turned to the window A greyclothed man was working in
the garden and whistling as he worked Theyre not so badly off said
Frere under his breath

Whats that sir asked Sylvia

That I am not half good enough for you cried Frere with sudden
vehemence I

Its my happiness youve got to think of Captain Bruin said the
girl Youve saved my life havent you and I should be wicked if I
didnt love you No no more kisses she added putting out her hand
Come papa its cool now lets walk in the garden and leave Maurice
to think of his own unworthiness

Maurice watched the retreating pair with a puzzled expression She
always leaves me for her father he said to himself I wonder if she
really loves me or if its only gratitude after all

He had often asked himself the same question during the five years of
his wooing but he had never satisfactorily answered it




CHAPTER II SARAH PURFOYS REQUEST



The evening passed as it had passed a hundred times before and having
smoked a pipe at the barracks Captain Frere returned home His home was
a cottage on the New Town Roada cottage which he had occupied since
his appointment as Assistant Police Magistrate an appointment given to
him as a reward for his exertions in connection with the Osprey mutiny
Captain Maurice Frere had risen in life Quartered in Hobart Town
he had assumed a position in society and had held several of those
excellent appointments which in the year 1834 were bestowed upon
officers of garrison He had been Superintendent of Works at
Bridgewater and when he got his captaincy Assistant Police Magistrate
at Bothwell The affair of the Osprey made a noise and it was tacitly
resolved that the first good thing that fell vacant should be given to
the gallant preserver of Major Vickerss child

Major Vickers also prospered He had always been a careful man and
having saved some money had purchased land on favourable terms The
assignment system enabled him to cultivate portions of it at a small
expense and following the usual custom he stocked his run with cattle
and sheep He had sold his commission and was now a comparatively
wealthy man He owned a fine estate the house he lived in was purchased
property He was in good odour at Government House and his office of
Superintendent of Convicts caused him to take an active part in that
local government which keeps a man constantly before the public
Major Vickers a colonist against his will had become by force of
circumstances one of the leading men in Van Diemens Land His daughter
was a good match for any man and many ensigns and lieutenants cursing
their hard lot in country quarters many sons of settlers living on
their fathers station among the mountains and many dapper clerks on
the civil establishment envied Maurice Frere his good fortune Some went
so far as to say that the beautiful daughter of Regulation Vickers was
too good for the coarse redfaced Frere who was noted for his fondness
for low society and overbearing almost brutal demeanour No one
denied however that Captain Frere was a valuable officer It was said
that in consequence of his tastes he knew more about the tricks of
convicts than any man on the island It was said even that he was wont
to disguise himself and mix with the passholders and convict
servants in order to learn their signs and mysteries When in charge at
Bridgewater it had been his delight to rate the chaingangs in their
own hideous jargon and to astound a newcomer by his knowledge of his
previous history The convict population hated and cringed to him for
with his brutality and violence he mingled a ferocious good humour
that resulted sometimes in tacit permission to go without the letter
of the law Yet as the convicts themselves said a man was never safe
with the Captain for after drinking and joking with them as the Sir
Oracle of some publichouse whose hostess he delighted to honour he
would disappear through a side door just as the constables burst in
at the back and show himself as remorseless in his next mornings
sentence of the captured as if he had never entered a taproom in all
his life His superiors called this zeal his inferiors treachery
For himself he laughed Everything is fair to those wretches he was
accustomed to say

As the time for his marriage approached however he had in a measure
given up these exploits and strove by his demeanour to make his
acquaintances forget several remarkable scandals concerning his
private life for the promulgation of which he once cared little When
Commandant at the Maria Island and for the first two years after his
return from the unlucky expedition to Macquarie Harbour he had not
suffered any fear of societys opinion to restrain his vices but
as the affection for the pure young girl who looked upon him as her
saviour from a dreadful death increased in honest strength he had
resolved to shut up those dark pages in his colonial experience and to
read therein no more He was not remorseful he was not even disgusted
He merely came to the conclusion that when a man married he was to
consider certain extravagances common to all bachelors as at an end
He had had his fling like all young men perhaps he had been foolish
like most young men but no reproachful ghost of past misdeeds haunted
him His nature was too prosaic to admit the existence of such phantoms
Sylvia in her purity and excellence was so far above him that in
raising his eyes to her he lost sight of all the sordid creatures to
whose level he had once debased himself and had come in part to regard
the sins he had committed before his redemption by the love of this
bright young creature as evil done by him under a past condition of
existence and for the consequences of which he was not responsible One
of the consequences however was very close to him at this moment His
convict servant had according to his instructions sat up for him and
as he entered the man handed him a letter bearing a superscription in
a female hand

Who brought this asked Frere hastily tearing it open to read
The groom sir He said that there was a gentleman at the George the
Fourth who wished to see you

Frere smiled in admiration of the intelligence which had dictated such
a message and then frowned in anger at the contents of the letter You
neednt wait he said to the man I shall have to go back again I
suppose

Changing his forage cap for a soft hat and selecting a stick from a
miscellaneous collection in a corner he prepared to retrace his steps
What does she want now he asked himself fiercely as he strode down
the moonlit road but beneath the fierceness there was an undercurrent
of petulance which implied that whatever she did want she had a
right to expect

The George the Fourth was a long low house situated in Elizabeth
Street Its front was painted a dull red and the narrow panes of glass
in its windows and the ostentatious affectation of red curtains and
homely comfort gave to it a spurious appearance of old English
jollity A knot of men round the door melted into air as Captain Frere
approached for it was now past eleven oclock and all persons found
in the streets after eight could be compelled to show their pass or
explain their business The convict constables were not scrupulous in
the exercise of their duty and the bluff figure of Frere clad in the
blue serge which he affected as a summer costume looked not unlike that
of a convict constable

Pushing open the side door with the confident manner of one well
acquainted with the house Frere entered and made his way along a
narrow passage to a glass door at the further end A tap upon this door
brought a whitefaced pockpitted Irish girl who curtsied with servile
recognition of the visitor and ushered him upstairs The room into
which he was shown was a large one It had three windows looking into
the street and was handsomely furnished The carpet was soft the
candles were bright and the supper tray gleamed invitingly from a table
between the windows As Frere entered a little terrier ran barking to
his feet It was evident that he was not a constant visitor The rustle
of a silk dress behind the terrier betrayed the presence of a woman and
Frere rounding the promontory of an ottoman found himself face to face
with Sarah Purfoy

Thank you for coming she said Pray sit down

This was the only greeting that passed between them and Frere sat down
in obedience to a motion of a plump hand that twinkled with rings

The eleven years that had passed since we last saw this woman had dealt
gently with her Her foot was as small and her hand as white as of yore
Her hair bound close about her head was plentiful and glossy and
her eyes had lost none of their dangerous brightness Her figure was
coarser and the white arm that gleamed through a muslin sleeve showed
an outline that a fastidious artist might wish to modify The most
noticeable change was in her face The cheeks owned no longer that
delicate purity which they once boasted but had become thicker while
here and there showed those faint red streaksas though the rich blood
throbbed too painfully in the veinswhich are the first signs of the
decay of fine women With middle age and the fullness of figure
to which most women of her temperament are prone had come also that
indescribable vulgarity of speech and manner which habitual absence of
moral restraint never fails to produce

Maurice Frere spoke first he was anxious to bring his visit to as
speedy a termination as possible What do you want of me he asked

Sarah Purfoy laughed a forced laugh that sounded so unnatural that
Frere turned to look at her I want you to do me a favoura very great
favour that is if it will not put you out of the way

What do you mean asked Frere roughly pursing his lips with a sullen
air Favour What do you call this striking the sofa on which he
sat Isnt this a favour What do you call your precious house and all
thats in it Isnt that a favour What do you mean

To his utter astonishment the woman replied by shedding tears For some
time he regarded her in silence as if unwilling to be softened by such
shallow device but eventually felt constrained to say something Have
you been drinking again he asked or whats the matter with you
Tell me what it is you want and have done with it I dont know what
possessed me to come here at all

Sarah sat upright and dashed away her tears with one passionate hand

I am ill cant you see you fool said she The news has unnerved
me If I have been drinking what then Its nothing to you is it

Oh no returned the other its nothing to me You are the principal
party concerned If you choose to bloat yourself with brandy do it by
all means

You dont pay for it at any rate said she with quickness of
retaliation which showed that this was not the only occasion on which
they had quarrelled

Come said Frere impatiently brutal get on I cant stop here all
night

She suddenly rose and crossed to where he was standing

Maurice you were very fond of me once

Once said Maurice

Not so very many years ago

Hang it said he shifting his arm from beneath her hand dont let
us have all that stuff over again It was before you took to drinking
and swearing and going raving mad with passion any way

Well dear said she with her great glittering eyes belying the soft
tones of her voice I suffered for it didnt I Didnt you turn me out
into the streets Didnt you lash me with your whip like a dog Didnt
you put me in gaol for it eh Its hard to struggle against you
Maurice

The compliment to his obstinacy seemed to please himperhaps the crafty
woman intended that it shouldand he smiled

Well there let old times be old times Sarah You havent done badly
after all and he looked round the wellfurnished room What do you
want

There was a transport came in this morning

Well

You know who was on board her Maurice

Maurice brought one hand into the palm of the other with a rough laugh

Oh thats it is it Gad what a flat I was not to think of it
before You want to see him I suppose She came close to him and in
her earnestness took his hand I want to save his life

Oh that be hanged you know Save his life It cant be done

You can do it Maurice

I save John Rexs life cried Frere Why you must be mad

He is the only creature that loves me Mauricethe only man who cares
for me He has done no harm He only wanted to be freewas it not
natural You can save him if you like I only ask for his life What
does it matter to you A miserable prisonerhis death would be of no
use Let him live Maurice

Maurice laughed What have I to do with it

You are the principal witness against him If you say that he behaved
welland he did behave well you know many men would have left you to
starvethey wont hang him

Oh wont they That wont make much difference

Ah Maurice be merciful She bent towards him and tried to retain
his hand but he withdrew it

Youre a nice sort of woman to ask me to help your lovera man who
left me on that cursed coast to die for all he cared he said with a
galling recollection of his humiliation of five years back Save him
Confound him not I

Ah Maurice you will She spoke with a suppressed sob in her voice
What is it to you You dont care for me now You beat me and turned
me out of doors though I never did you wrong This man was a husband
to melong long before I met you He never did you any harm he never
will He will bless you if you save him Maurice

Frere jerked his head impatiently Bless me he said I dont want
his blessings Let him swing Who cares

Still she persisted with tears streaming from her eyes with white arms
upraised on her knees even catching at his coat and beseeching him
in broken accents In her wild fierce beauty and passionate abandonment
she might have been a deserted Ariadnea suppliant Medea Anything
rather than what she wasa dissolute halfmaddened woman praying for
the pardon of her convict husband

Maurice Frere flung her off with an oath Get up he cried brutally
and stop that nonsense I tell you the mans as good as dead for all I
shall do to save him

At this repulse her pentup passion broke forth She sprang to her
feet and pushing back the hair that in her frenzied pleading had
fallen about her face poured out upon him a torrent of abuse You Who
are you that you dare to speak to me like that His little finger is
worth your whole body He is a man a brave man not a coward like you
A coward Yes a coward a coward A coward You are very brave with
defenceless men and weak women You have beaten me until I was bruised
black you cur but who ever saw you attack a man unless he was
chained or bound Do not I know you I have seen you taunt a man at
the triangles until I wished the screaming wretch could get loose
and murder you as you deserve You will be murdered one of these days
Maurice Freretake my word for it Men are flesh and blood and flesh
and blood wont endure the torments you lay on it

There thatll do says Frere growing paler Dont excite yourself

I know you you brutal coward I have not been your mistressGod
forgive mewithout learning you by heart Ive seen your ignorance and
your conceit Ive seen the men who ate your food and drank your
wine laugh at you Ive heard what your friends say Ive heard the
comparisons they make One of your dogs has more brains than you and
twice as much heart And these are the men they send to rule us Oh
Heaven And such an animal as this has life and death in his hand He
may hang may he Ill hang with him then and God will forgive me for
murder for I will kill you

Frere had cowered before this frightful torrent of rage but at the
scream which accompanied the last words he stepped forward as though
to seize her In her desperate courage she flung herself before him
Strike me You darent I defy you Bring up the wretched creatures who
learn the way to Hell in this cursed house and let them see you do it
Call them They are old friends of yours They all know Captain Maurice
Frere

Sarah

You remember Lucy Barnespoor little Lucy Barnes that stole
sixpennyworth of calico She is downstairs now Would you know her if
you saw her She isnt the brightfaced baby she was when they sent her
here to reform and when Lieutenant Frere wanted a new housemaid from
the Factory Call for hercall do you hear Ask any one of those
beasts whom you lash and chain for Lucy Barnes Hell tell you all
about heray and about many moremany more poor souls that are at
the bidding of any drunken brute that has stolen a pound note to fee the
Devil with Oh you good God in Heaven will You not judge this man

Frere trembled He had often witnessed this creatures whirlwinds
of passion but never had he seen her so violent as this Her frenzy
frightened him For Heavens sake Sarah be quiet What is it you
want What would you do

Ill go to this girl you want to marry and tell her all I know of you
I have seen her in the streetshave seen her look the other way when
I passed herhave seen her gather up her muslin skirts when my silks
touched herI that nursed her that heard her say her babyprayers O
Jesus pity meand I know what she thinks of women like me She is
goodand virtuousand cold She would shudder at you if she knew what
I know Shudder She would hate you And I will tell her Ay I will
You will be respectable will you A model husband Wait till I tell her
my storytill I send some of these poor women to tell theirs You kill
my love Ill blight and ruin yours

Frere caught her by both wrists and with all his strength forced her to
her knees Dont speak her name he said in a hoarse voice or Ill
do you a mischief I know all you mean to do Im not such a fool as not
to see that Be quiet Men have murdered women like you and now I know
how they came to do it

For a few minutes a silence fell upon the pair and at last Frere
releasing her hands fell back from her

Ill do what you want on one condition

What

That you leave this place

Where for

Anywherethe farther the better Ill pay your passage to Sydney and
you go or stay there as you please

She had grown calmer hearing him thus relenting But this house
Maurice

You are not in debt

No

Well leave it Its your own affair not mine If I help you you must
go

May I see him

No

Ah Maurice

You can see him in the dock if you like says Frere with a laugh cut
short by a flash of her eyes There I didnt mean to offend you

Offend me Go on

Listen here said he doggedly If you will go away and promise never
to interfere with me by word or deed Ill do what you want

What will you do she asked unable to suppress a smile at the victory
she had won

I will not say all I know about this man I will say he befriended me
I will do my best to save his life

You can save it if you like

Well I will try On my honour I will try

I must believe you I suppose said she doubtfully and then with
a sudden pitiful pleading in strange contrast to her former violence
You are not deceiving me Maurice

No Why should I You keep your promise and Ill keep mine Is it a
bargain

Yes

He eyed her steadfastly for some seconds and then turned on his heel
As he reached the door she called him back Knowing him as she did
she felt that he would keep his word and her feminine nature could not
resist a parting sneer

There is nothing in the bargain to prevent me helping him to escape
she said with a smile

Escape He wont escape again Ill go bail Once get him in double
irons at Port Arthur and hes safe enough

The smile on her face seemed infectious for his own sullen features
relaxed Good night Sarah he said

She put out her hand as if nothing had happened Good night Captain
Frere Its a bargain then

A bargain

You have a long walk home Will you have some brandy

I dont care if I do he said advancing to the table and filling his
glass Heres a good voyage to you

Sarah Purfoy watching him burst into a laugh Human beings are queer
creatures she said Who would have thought that we had been calling
each other names just now I say Im a vixen when Im roused aint I
Maurice

Remember what youve promised said he with a threat in his voice
as he moved to the door You must be out of this by the next ship that
leaves

Never fear Ill go

Getting into the cool street directly and seeing the calm stars
shining and the placid water sleeping with a peace in which he had
no share he strove to cast off the nervous fear that was on him That
interview had frightened him for it had made him think It was hard
that just as he had turned over a new leaf this old blot should
come through to the clean page It was cruel that having comfortably
forgotten the past he should be thus rudely reminded of it




CHAPTER III THE STORY OF TWO BIRDS OF PREY



The reader of the foregoing pages has doubtless asked himself what is
the link which binds together John Rex and Sarah Purfoy

In the year 1825 there lived at St Heliers Jersey an old watchmaker
named Urban Purfoy He was a hardworking man and had amassed a little
moneysufficient to give his granddaughter an education above the
common in those days At sixteen Sarah Purfoy was an emptyheaded
strongwilled precocious girl with big brown eyes She had a bad
opinion of her own sex and an immense admiration for the young and
handsome members of the other The neighbours said that she was too
high and mighty for her rank in life Her grandfather said she was a
beauty and like her poor dear mother She herself thought rather
meanly of her personal attractions and rather highly of her mental
ones She was brimful of vitality with strong passions and little
religious sentiment She had not much respect for moral courage for
she did not understand it but she was a profound admirer of personal
prowess Her distaste for the humdrum life she was leading found
expression in a rebellion against social usages She courted notoriety
by eccentricities of dress and was never so happy as when she was
misunderstood She was the sort of girl of whom women sayIt is a pity
she has no mother and men It is a pity she does not get a husband
and who say to themselves When shall I have a lover There was no
lack of beings of this latter class among the officers quartered in Fort
Royal and Fort Henry but the female population of the island was free
and numerous and in the embarrassment of riches Sarah was overlooked
Though she adored the soldiery her first lover was a civilian Walking
one day on the cliff she met a young man He was tall welllooking
and welldressed His name was Lemoine he was the son of a somewhat
wealthy resident of the island and had come down from London to recruit
his health and to see his friends Sarah was struck by his appearance
and looked back at him He had been struck by hers and looked back
also He followed her and spoke to hersome remark about the wind
or the weatherand she thought his voice divine They got into
conversationabout scenery lonely walks and the dullness of St
Heliers Did she often walk there Sometimes Would she be there
tomorrow She might Mr Lemoine lifted his hat and went back to
dinner rather pleased with himself

They met the next day and the day after that Lemoine was not a
gentleman but he had lived among gentlemen and had caught something of
their manner He said that after all virtue was a mere name and that
when people were powerful and rich the world respected them more than
if they had been honest and poor Sarah agreed with this sentiment Her
grandfather was honest and poor and yet nobody respected himat least
not with such respect as she cared to acknowledge In addition to his
talent for argument Lemoine was handsome and had moneyhe showed her
quite a handful of banknotes one day He told her of London and the
great ladies there and hinting that they were not always virtuous drew
himself up with a moody air as though he had been unhappily the cause
of their fatal lapse into wickedness Sarah did not wonder at this in
the least Had she been a great lady she would have done the same She
began to coquet with this seductive fellow and to hint to him that
she had too much knowledge of the world to set a fictitious value upon
virtue He mistook her artfulness for innocence and thought he had made
a conquest Moreover the girl was pretty and when dressed properly
would look well Only one obstacle stood in the way of their lovesthe
dashing profligate was poor He had been living in London above his
means and his father was not inclined to increase his allowance

Sarah liked him better than anybody else she had seen but there are
two sides to every bargain Sarah Purfoy must go to London In vain her
lover sighed and swore Unless he would promise to take her away with
him Diana was not more chaste The more virtuous she grew the more
vicious did Lemoine feel His desire to possess her increased in
proportionate ratio to her resistance and at last he borrowed two
hundred pounds from his fathers confidential clerk the Lemoines were
merchants by profession and acceded to her wishes There was no love
on either sidevanity was the mainspring of the whole transaction
Lemoine did not like to be beaten Sarah sold herself for a passage to
England and an introduction into the great world

We need not describe her career at this epoch Suffice it to say that
she discovered that vice is not always conducive to happiness and is
not even in this world so well rewarded as its earnest practice might
merit Sated and disappointed she soon grew tired of her life and
longed to escape from its wearying dissipations At this juncture she
fell in love

The object of her affections was one Mr Lionel Crofton Crofton was
tall well made and with an insinuating address His features were too
strongly marked for beauty His eyes were the best part of his face
and like his hair they were jet black He had broad shoulders sinewy
limbs and small hands and feet His head was round and wellshaped
but it bulged a little over the ears which were singularly small and lay
close to his head With this man barely four years older than herself
Sarah at seventeen fell violently in love This was the more strange
as though fond of her he would tolerate no caprices and possessed
an ungovernable temper which found vent in curses and even blows He
seemed to have no profession or business and though he owned a good
address he was even less of a gentleman than Lemoine Yet Sarah
attracted by one of the strange sympathies which constitute the romance
of such womens lives was devoted to him Touched by her affection
and rating her intelligence and unscrupulousness at their true value he
told her who he was He was a swindler a forger and a thief and
his name was John Rex When she heard this she experienced a sinister
delight He told her of his plots his tricks his escapes his
villainies and seeing how for years this young man had preyed upon the
world which had deceived and disowned her her heart went out to him I
am glad you found me she said Two heads are better than one We will
work together

John Rex known among his intimate associates as Dandy Jack was
the putative son of a man who had been for many years valet to Lord
Bellasis and who retired from the service of that profligate nobleman
with a sum of money and a wife John Rex was sent to as good a school as
could be procured for him and at sixteen was given by the interest
of his mother with his fathers former master a clerkship in an
oldestablished city bankinghouse Mrs Rex was intensely fond of her
son and imbued him with a desire to shine in aristocratic circles He
was a clever lad without any principle he would lie unblushingly and
steal deliberately if he thought he could do so with impunity He was
cautious acquisitive imaginative selfconceited and destructive He
had strong perceptive faculties and much invention and versatility but
his moral sense was almost entirely wanting He found that his fellow
clerks were not of that gentlemanly stamp which his mother thought so
admirable and therefore he despised them He thought he should like to
go into the army for he was athletic and rejoiced in feats of muscular
strength To be tied all day to a desk was beyond endurance But John
Rex senior told him to wait and see what came of it He did so and
in the meantime kept late hours got into bad company and forged the
name of a customer of the bank to a cheque for twenty pounds The fraud
was a clumsy one and was detected in twentyfour hours Forgeries by
clerks however easily detected are unfortunately not considered to
add to the attractions of a bankinghouse and the oldestablished firm
decided not to prosecute but dismissed Mr John Rex from their service
The exvalet who never liked his legalized son was at first for
turning him out of doors but by the entreaties of his wife was at last
induced to place the promising boy in a drapers shop in the City Road

This employment was not a congenial one and John Rex planned to leave
it He lived at home and had his salaryabout thirty shillings a
weekfor pocket money Though he displayed considerable skill with the
cue and not infrequently won considerable sums for one in his position
his expenses averaged more than his income and having borrowed all
he could he found himself again in difficulties His narrow escape
however had taught him a lesson and he resolved to confess all to his
indulgent mother and be more economical for the future Just then
one of those lucky chances which blight so many lives occurred The
shopwalker died and Messrs Baffaty  Co made the gentlemanly Rex
act as his substitute for a few days Shopwalkers have opportunities
not accorded to other folks and on the evening of the third day Mr Rex
went home with a bundle of lace in his pocket Unfortunately he owed
more than the worth of this petty theft and was compelled to steal
again This time he was detected One of his fellowshopmen caught
him in the very act of concealing a roll of silk ready for future
abstraction and to his astonishment cried Halves Rex pretended to
be virtuously indignant but soon saw that such pretence was useless
his companion was too wily to be fooled with such affectation of
innocence I saw you take it said he and if you wont share Ill
tell old Baffaty This argument was irresistible and they shared
Having become good friends the selfmade partner lent Rex a helping
hand in the disposal of the booty and introduced him to a purchaser
The purchaser violated all rules of romance by beingnot a Jew but a
very orthodox Christian He kept a secondhand clothes warehouse in
the City Road and was supposed to have branch establishments all over
London

Mr Blicks purchased the stolen goods for about a third of their value
and seemed struck by Mr Rexs appearance I thort you was a swell
mobsman said he This from one so experienced was a high compliment
Encouraged by success Rex and his companion took more articles of
value John Rex paid off his debts and began to feel himself quite a
gentleman again Just as Rex had arrived at this pleasing state of
mind Baffaty discovered the robbery Not having heard about the bank
business he did not suspect Rexhe was such a gentlemanly young
manbut having had his eye for some time upon Rexs partner who was
vulgar and squinted he sent for him Rexs partner stoutly denied the
accusation and old Baffaty who was a man of merciful tendencies and
could well afford to lose fifty pounds gave him until the next
morning to confess and state where the goods had gone hinting at the
persuasive powers of a constable at the end of that time The shopman
with tears in his eyes came in a hurry to Rex and informed him that
all was lost He did not want to confess because he must implicate
his friend Rex but if he did not confess he would be given in charge
Flight was impossible for neither had money In this dilemma John Rex
remembered Blickss compliment and burned to deserve it If he must
retreat he would lay waste the enemys country His exodus should
be like that of the Israeliteshe would spoil the Egyptians The
shopwalker was allowed half an hour in the middle of the day for lunch
John Rex took advantage of this halfhour to hire a cab and drive to
Blicks That worthy man received him cordially for he saw that he was
bent upon great deeds John Rex rapidly unfolded his plan of operations
The warehouse doors were fastened with a spring He would remain behind
after they were locked and open them at a given signal A light cart or
cab could be stationed in the lane at the back three men could fill
it with valuables in as many hours Did Blicks know of three such men
Blickss one eye glistened He thought he did know At halfpast eleven
they should be there Was that all No Mr John Rex was not going to
put up such a splendid thing for nothing The booty was worth at least
L5000 if it was worth a shillinghe must have L100 cash when the cart
stopped at Blickss door Blicks at first refused point blank Let
there be a division but he would not buy a pig in a poke Rex was firm
however it was his only chance and at last he got a promise of L80
That night the glorious achievement known in the annals of Bow Street
as The Great Silk Robbery took place and two days afterwards John Rex
and his partner dining comfortably at Birmingham read an account of
the transactionnot in the least like itin a London paper

John Rex who had now fairly broken with dull respectability bid adieu
to his home and began to realize his mothers wishes He was after his
fashion a gentleman As long as the L80 lasted he lived in
luxury and by the time it was spent he had established himself in
his profession This profession was a lucrative one It was that of a
swindler Gifted with a handsome person facile manner and ready wit
he had added to these natural advantages some skill at billiards some
knowledge of gamblers legerdemain and the useful consciousness that he
must prey or be preyed on John Rex was no common swindler his natural
as well as his acquired abilities saved him from vulgar errors He saw
that to successfully swindle mankind one must not aim at comparative
but superlative ingenuity He who is contented with being only cleverer
than the majority must infallibly be outwitted at last and to be once
outwitted isfor a swindlerto be ruined Examining moreover into
the history of detected crime John Rex discovered one thing At the
bottom of all these robberies deceptions and swindles was some lucky
fellow who profited by the folly of his confederates This gave him
an idea Suppose he could not only make use of his own talents to rob
mankind but utilize those of others also Crime runs through infinite
grades He proposed to himself to be at the top but why should he
despise those good fellows beneath him His speciality was swindling
billiardplaying cardplaying borrowing money obtaining goods never
risking more than two or three coups in a year But others plundered
houses stole bracelets watches diamondsmade as much in a night as
he did in six monthsonly their occupation was more dangerous Now came
the questionwhy more dangerous Because these men were mere clods
bold enough and clever enough in their own rude way but no match
for the law with its Argus eyes and its Briarean hands They did the
rougher business well enough they broke locks and burst doors and
neddied constables but in the finer arts of plan attack and escape
they were sadly deficient Good These men should be the hands he would
be the head He would plan the robberies they should execute them

Working through many channels and never omitting to assist a
fellowworker when in distress John Rex in a few years and in a most
prosaic business way became the head of a society of ruffians Mixing
with fast clerks and unsuspecting middleclass profligates he found out
particulars of houses ill guarded and shops insecurely fastened and
put up Blickss ready ruffians to the more dangerous work In his
various disguises and under his many names he found his way into those
upper circles of fast society where animals turn into birds where a
wolf becomes a rook and a lamb a pigeon Rich spendthrifts who affected
male society asked him to their houses and Mr Anthony Croftonbury
Captain James Craven and Mr Lionel Crofton were names remembered
sometimes with pleasure oftener with regret by many a broken man
of fortune He had one quality which to a man of his profession
was invaluablehe was cautious and master of himself Having made
a success wrung commission from Blicks rooked a gambling ninny like
Lemoine or secured an assortment of jewellery sent down to his wife
in Gloucestershire he would disappear for a time He liked comfort and
revelled in the sense of security and respectability Thus he had lived
for three years when he met Sarah Purfoy and thus he proposed to live
for many more With this woman as a coadjutor he thought he could defy
the law She was the net spread to catch his pigeons she was the
welldressed lady who ordered goods in London for her husband at
Canterbury and paid half the price down which was all this letter
authorized her to do and where a less beautiful or clever woman might
have failed she succeeded Her husband saw fortune before him
and believed that with common prudence he might carry on his most
lucrative employment of gentleman until he chose to relinquish it
Alas for human weakness He one day did a foolish thing and the law he
had so successfully defied got him in the simplest way imaginable

Under the names of Mr and Mrs Skinner John Rex and Sarah Purfoy
were living in quiet lodgings in the neighbourhood of Bloomsbury
Their landlady was a respectable poor woman and had a son who was a
constable This son was given to talking and coming in to supper one
night he told his mother that on the following evening an attack was
to be made on a gang of coiners in the Old Street Road The mother
dreaming all sorts of horrors during the night came the next day to
Mrs Skinner in the parlour and under a pledge of profound secrecy
told her of the dreadful expedition in which her son was engaged John
Rex was out at a pigeon match with Lord Bellasis and when he returned
at nine oclock Sarah told him what she had heard

Now 4 Bankplace Old Street Road was the residence of a man named
Green who had for some time carried on the lucrative but dangerous
trade of counterfeiting This man was one of the most daring of that
army of ruffians whose treasure chest and master of the mint was Blicks
and his liberty was valuable John Rex eating his dinner more nervously
than usual ruminated on the intelligence and thought it would be
but wise to warn Green of his danger Not that he cared much for
Green personally but it was bad policy to miss doing a good turn to
a comrade and moreover Green if captured might wag his tongue too
freely But how to do it If he went to Blicks it might be too late he
would go himself He went outand was captured When Sarah heard of the
calamity she set to work to help him She collected all her money and
jewels paid Mrs Skinners rent went to see Rex and arranged
his defence Blicks was hopeful but Greenwho came very near
hangingadmitted that the man was an associate of his and the
Recorder being in a severe mood transported him for seven years Sarah
Purfoy vowed that she would follow him She was going as passenger
as emigrant anything when she saw Mrs Vickerss advertisement for a
ladysmaid and answered it It chanced that Rex was shipped in the
Malabar and Sarah discovering this before the vessel had been a week
at sea conceived the bold project of inciting a mutiny for the rescue
of her lover We know the result of that scheme and the story of the
scoundrels subsequent escape from Macquarie Harbour




CHAPTER IV THE NOTORIOUS DAWES



The mutineers of the Osprey had been long since given up as dead and
the story of their desperate escape had become indistinct to the general
public mind Now that they had been recaptured in a remarkable manner
popular belief invested them with all sorts of strange surroundings
They had beenaccording to reportkings over savage islanders chiefs
of lawless and ferocious pirates respectable married men in Java
merchants in Singapore and swindlers in Hong Kong Their adventures had
been dramatized at a London theatre and the popular novelist of that
day was engaged in a work descriptive of their wondrous fortunes

John Rex the ringleader was related it was said to a noble family
and a special message had come out to Sir John Franklin concerning him
He had every prospect of being satisfactorily hung however for even
the most outspoken admirers of his skill and courage could not but admit
that he had committed an offence which was death by the law The Crown
would leave nothing undone to convict him and the already crowded
prison was recrammed with half a dozen life sentence men brought up
from Port Arthur to identify the prisoners Amongst this number was
stated to be the notorious Dawes

This statement gave fresh food for recollection and invention It was
remembered that the notorious Dawes was the absconder who had been
brought away by Captain Frere and who owed such fettered life as he
possessed to the fact that he had assisted Captain Frere to make the
wonderful boat in which the marooned party escaped It was remembered
also how sullen and morose he had been on his trial five years before
and how he had laughed when the commutation of his death sentence was
announced to him The Hobart Town Gazette published a short biography of
this horrible villaina biography setting forth how he had been engaged
in a mutiny on board the convict ship how he had twice escaped from the
Macquarie Harbour how he had been repeatedly flogged for violence and
insubordination and how he was now doubleironed at Port Arthur
after two more ineffectual attempts to regain his freedom Indeed the
Gazette discovering that the wretch had been originally transported for
highway robbery argued very ably it would be far better to hang such
wild beasts in the first instance than suffer them to cumber the ground
and grow confirmed in villainy Of what use to society asked the
Gazette quite pathetically has this scoundrel been during the last
eleven years And everybody agreed that he had been of no use whatever

Miss Sylvia Vickers also received an additional share of public
attention Her romantic rescue by the heroic Frere who was shortly to
reap the reward of his devotion in the good old fashion made her almost
as famous as the villain Dawes or his confederate monster John Rex It
was reported that she was to give evidence on the trial together with
her affianced husband they being the only two living witnesses who
could speak to the facts of the mutiny It was reported also that her
lover was naturally most anxious that she should not give evidence as
she wasan additional point of romantic interestaffected deeply by
the illness consequent on the suffering she had undergone and in a
state of pitiable mental confusion as to the whole business These
reports caused the Court on the day of the trial to be crowded with
spectators and as the various particulars of the marvellous history of
this double escape were detailed the excitement grew more intense The
aspect of the four heavilyironed prisoners caused a sensation which
in that city of the ironed was quite novel and bets were offered and
taken as to the line of defence which they would adopt At first it
was thought that they would throw themselves on the mercy of the Crown
seeking in the very extravagance of their story to excite public
sympathy but a little study of the demeanour of the chief prisoner
John Rex dispelled that conjecture Calm placid and defiant he
seemed prepared to accept his fate or to meet his accusers with some
plea which should be sufficient to secure his acquittal on the capital
charge Only when he heard the indictment setting forth that he had
feloniously pirated the brig Osprey he smiled a little

Mr Meekin sitting in the body of the Court felt his religious
prejudices sadly shocked by that smile A perfect wild beast my dear
Miss Vickers he said returning in a pause during the examination
of the convicts who had been brought to identify the prisoner to the
little room where Sylvia and her father were waiting He has quite a
tigerish look about him

Poor man said Sylvia with a shudder

Poor My dear young lady you do not pity him

I do said Sylvia twisting her hands together as if in pain I pity
them all poor creatures

Charming sensibility says Meekin with a glance at Vickers The true
womans heart my dear Major

The Major tapped his fingers impatiently at this illtimed twaddle
Sylvia was too nervous just then for sentiment Come here Poppet he
said and look through this door You can see them from here and if
you do not recognize any of them I cant see what is the use of putting
you in the box though of course if it is necessary you must go

The raised dock was just opposite to the door of the room in which
they were sitting and the four manacled men each with an armed warder
behind him were visible above the heads of the crowd The girl had
never before seen the ceremony of trying a man for his life and the
silent and antique solemnities of the business affected her as it
affects all who see it for the first time The atmosphere was heavy and
distressing The chains of the prisoners clanked ominously The crushing
force of judge gaolers warders and constables assembled to punish
the four men appeared cruel The familiar faces that in her momentary
glance she recognized seemed to her evilly transfigured Even the
countenance of her promised husband bent eagerly forward towards
the witnessbox showed tyrannous and bloodthirsty Her eyes hastily
followed the pointing finger of her father and sought the men in the
dock Two of them lounged sullen and inattentive one nervously chewed
a straw or piece of twig pawing the dock with restless hand the
fourth scowled across the Court at the witnessbox which she could not
see The four faces were all strange to her

No papa she said with a sigh of relief I cant recognize them at
all

As she was turning from the door a voice from the witnessbox behind
her made her suddenly pale and pause to look again The Court itself
appeared at that moment affected for a murmur ran through it and
some official cried Silence

The notorious criminal Rufus Dawes the desperado of Port Arthur the
wild beast whom the Gazette had judged not fit to live had just entered
the witnessbox He was a man of thirty in the prime of life with a
torso whose muscular grandeur not even the illfitting yellow jacket
could altogether conceal with strong embrowned and nervous hands an
upright carriage and a pair of fierce black eyes that roamed over the
Court hungrily

Not all the weight of the double irons swaying from the leathern thong
around his massive loins could mar that elegance of attitude which
comes only from perfect muscular development Not all the frowning faces
bent upon him could frown an accent of respect into the contemptuous
tones in which he answered to his name Rufus Dawes prisoner of the
Crown

Come away my darling said Vickers alarmed at his daughters
blanched face and eager eyes

Wait she said impatiently listening for the voice whose owner she
could not see Rufus Dawes Oh I have heard that name before

You are a prisoner of the Crown at the penal settlement of Port
Arthur

Yes

For life

For life

Sylvia turned to her father with breathless inquiry in her eyes Oh
papa who is that speaking I know the name the voice

That is the man who was with you in the boat dear says Vickers
gravely The prisoner

The eager light died out of her eyes and in its place came a look
of disappointment and pain I thought it was a good man she said
holding by the edge of the doorway It sounded like a good voice

And then she pressed her hands over her eyes and shuddered There
there says Vickers soothingly dont be afraid Poppet he cant hurt
you now

No ha ha says Meekin with great display of offhand courage the
villains safe enough now

The colloquy in the Court went on Do you know the prisoners in the
dock

Yes Who are they

John Rex Henry Shiers James Lesly and andIm not sure about the
last man You are not sure about the last man Will you swear to the
three others

Yes

You remember them well

I was in the chaingang at Macquarie Harbour with them for three
years Sylvia hearing this hideous reason for acquaintance gave a low
cry and fell into her fathers arms

Oh papa take me away I feel as if I was going to remember something
terrible

Amid the deep silence that prevailed the cry of the poor girl was
distinctly audible in the Court and all heads turned to the door In
the general wonder no one noticed the change that passed over Rufus
Dawes His face flushed scarlet great drops of sweat stood on his
forehead and his black eyes glared in the direction from whence the
sound came as though they would pierce the envious wood that separated
him from the woman whose voice he had heard Maurice Frere sprang up and
pushed his way through the crowd under the bench

Whats this he said to Vickers almost brutally What did you bring
her here for She is not wanted I told you that

I considered it my duty sir says Vickers with stately rebuke

What has frightened her What has she heard What has she seen asked
Frere with a strangely white face Sylvia Sylvia

She opened her eyes at the sound of his voice Take me home papa Im
ill Oh what thoughts

What does she mean cried Frere looking in alarm from one to the
other

That ruffian Dawes frightened her said Meekin A gush of
recollection poor child There there calm yourself Miss Vickers He
is quite safe

Frightened her eh Yes said Sylvia faintly he frightened me
Maurice I neednt stop any longer dear need I

No says Frere the cloud passing from his face Major I beg your
pardon but I was hasty Take her home at once This sort of thing is
too much for her And so he went back to his place wiping his brow
and breathing hard as one who had just escaped from some near peril

Rufus Dawes had remained in the same attitude until the figure of Frere
passing through the doorway roused him Who is she he said in a
low hoarse voice to the constable behind him Miss Vickers said the
man shortly flinging the information at him as one might fling a bone
to a dangerous dog

Miss Vickers repeated the convict still staring in a sort of
bewildered agony They told me she was dead

The constable sniffed contemptuously at this preposterous conclusion as
who should say If you know all about it animal why did you ask
and then feeling that the fixed gaze of his interrogator demanded some
reply added You thort she was Ive no doubt You did your best to
make her so Ive heard

The convict raised both his hands with sudden action of wrathful
despair as though he would seize the other despite the loaded muskets
but checking himself with sudden impulse wheeled round to the Court

Your HonourGentlemen I want to speak

The change in the tone of his voice no less than the sudden loudness
of the exclamation made the faces hitherto bent upon the door through
which Mr Frere had passed turn round again To many there it seemed
that the notorious Dawes was no longer in the box for in place of
the upright and defiant villain who stood there an instant back was a
whitefaced nervous agitated creature bending forward in an attitude
almost of supplication one hand grasping the rail as though to save
himself from falling the other outstretched towards the bench Your
Honour there has been some dreadful mistake made I want to explain
about myself I explained before when first I was sent to Port Arthur
but the letters were never forwarded by the Commandant of course
thats the rule and I cant complain Ive been sent there unjustly
your Honour I made that boat your Honour I saved the Majors wife and
daughter I was the man I did it all myself and my liberty was sworn
away by a villain who hated me I thought until now that no one knew
the truth for they told me that she was dead His rapid utterance
took the Court so much by surprise that no one interrupted him I was
sentenced to death for bolting sir and they reprieved me because I
helped them in the boat Helped them Why I made it She will tell you
so I nursed her I carried her in my arms I starved myself for
her She was fond of me sir She was indeed She called me Good Mr
Dawes

At this a coarse laugh broke out which was instantly checked The
judge bent over to ask Does he mean Miss Vickers and in this
interval Rufus Dawes looking down into the Court saw Maurice Frere
staring up at him with terror in his eyes I see you Captain Frere
coward and liar Put him in the box gentlemen and make him tell his
story Shell contradict him never fear Oh and I thought she was dead
all this while

The judge had got his answer from the clerk by this time Miss Vickers
had been seriously ill had fainted just now in the Court Her only
memories of the convict who had been with her in the boat were those
of terror and disgust The sight of him just now had most seriously
affected her The convict himself was an inveterate liar and schemer
and his story had been already disproved by Captain Frere

The judge a man inclining by nature to humanity but forced by
experience to receive all statements of prisoners with caution said
all he could say and the tragedy of five years was disposed of in the
following dialogue JUDGE This is not the place for an accusation
against Captain Frere nor the place to argue upon your alleged
wrongs If you have suffered injustice the authorities will hear your
complaint and redress it

RUFUS DAWES I have complained your Honour I wrote letter after letter
to the Government but they were never sent Then I heard she was
dead and they sent me to the Coal Mines after that and we never hear
anything there

JUDGE I cant listen to you Mr Mangles have you any more questions to
ask the witness

But Mr Mangles not having any more someone called Matthew Gabbett
and Rufus Dawes still endeavouring to speak was clanked away with
amid a buzz of remark and surmise


     


The trial progressed without further incident Sylvia was not called
and to the astonishment of many of his enemies Captain Frere went into
the witnessbox and generously spoke in favour of John Rex He might
have left us to starve Frere said he might have murdered us we were
completely in his power The stock of provisions on board the brig was
not a large one and I consider that in dividing it with us he showed
great generosity for one in his situation This piece of evidence told
strongly in favour of the prisoners for Captain Frere was known to
be such an uncompromising foe to all rebellious convicts that it was
understood that only the sternest sense of justice and truth could lead
him to speak in such terms The defence set up by Rex moreover was
most ingenious He was guilty of absconding but his moderation might
plead an excuse for that His only object was his freedom and having
gained it he had lived honestly for nearly three years as he could
prove He was charged with piratically seizing the brig Osprey and he
urged that the brig Osprey having been built by convicts at Macquarie
Harbour and never entered in any shipping list could not be said to
be piratically seized in the strict meaning of the term The Court
admitted the force of this objection and influenced doubtless by
Captain Freres evidence the fact that five years had passed since the
mutiny and that the two men most guilty Cheshire and Barker had
been executed in England sentenced Rex and his three companions to
transportation for life to the penal settlements of the colony




CHAPTER V MAURICE FRERES GOOD ANGEL



At this happy conclusion to his labours Frere went down to comfort the
girl for whose sake he had suffered Rex to escape the gallows On his
way he was met by a man who touched his hat and asked to speak with
him an instant This man was past middle age owned a red brandybeaten
face and had in his gait and manner that nameless something that
denotes the seaman

Well Blunt says Frere pausing with the impatient air of a man who
expects to hear bad news what is it now

Only to tell you that it is all right sir says Blunt Shes come
aboard again this morning

Come aboard again ejaculated Frere Why I didnt know that she
had been ashore Where did she go He spoke with an air of confident
authority and Bluntno longer the bluff tyrant of oldseemed to quail
before him The trial of the mutineers of the Malabar had ruined Phineas
Blunt Make what excuses he might there was no concealing the fact that
Pine found him drunk in his cabin when he ought to have been attending
to his duties on deck and the authorities could not or would not
pass over such a heinous breach of discipline Captain Bluntwho of
course had his own version of the storythus deprived of the honour of
bringing His Majestys prisoners to His Majestys colonies of New South
Wales and Van Diemens Land went on a whaling cruise to the South Seas
The influence which Sarah Purfoy had acquired over him had however
irretrievably injured him It was as though she had poisoned his moral
nature by the influence of a clever and wicked woman over a sensual
and dullwitted man Blunt gradually sank lower and lower He became
a drunkard and was known as a man with a grievance against the
Government Captain Frere having had occasion for him in some
capacity had become in a manner his patron and had got him the command
of a schooner trading from Sydney On getting this commandnot without
some wry faces on the part of the owner resident in Hobart TownBlunt
had taken the temperance pledge for the space of twelve months and was
a miserable dog in consequence He was however a faithful henchman
for he hoped by Freres means to get some Government billetthe grand
object of all colonial sea captains of that epoch

Well sir she went ashore to see a friend says Blunt looking at the
sky and then at the earth

What friend

Thethe prisoner sir

And she saw him I suppose

Yes but I thought Id better tell you sir says Blunt

Of course quite right returned the other you had better start at
once Its no use waiting

As you wish sir I can sail tomorrow morningor this evening if you
like

This evening says Frere turning away as soon as possible

Theres a situation in Sydney Ive been looking after said the other
uneasily if you could help me to it

What is it

The command of one of the Government vessels sir

Well keep sober then says Frere and Ill see what I can do And
keep that womans tongue still if you can

The pair looked at each other and Blunt grinned slavishly

Ill do my best Take care you do returned his patron leaving him
without further ceremony

Frere found Vickers in the garden and at once begged him not to talk
about the business to his daughter

You saw how bad she was today Vickers For goodness sake dont make
her ill again

My dear sir says poor Vickers I wont refer to the subject Shes
been very unwell ever since Nervous and unstrung Go in and see her

So Frere went in and soothed the excited girl with real sorrow at her
suffering

Its all right now Poppet he said to her Dont think of it any
more Put it out of your mind dear

It was foolish of me Maurice I know but I could not help it The
sound ofofthat mans voice seemed to bring back to me some great
pity for something or someone I dont explain what I mean I know
but I felt that I was on the verge of remembering a story of some great
wrong just about to hear some dreadful revelation that should make me
turn from all the people whom I ought most to love Do you understand

I think I know what you mean says Frere with averted face But
thats all nonsense you know

Of course returned she with a touch of her old childish manner of
disposing of questions out of hand Everybody knows its all nonsense
But then we do think such things It seems to me that I am double that
I have lived somewhere before and have had another lifea dreamlife

What a romantic girl you are said the other dimly comprehending her
meaning How could you have a dreamlife

Of course not really stupid But in thought you know I dream such
strange things now and then I am always falling down precipices and
into cataracts and being pushed into great caverns in enormous rocks
Horrible dreams

Indigestion returned Frere You dont take exercise enough You
shouldnt read so much Have a good fivemile walk

And in these dreams continued Sylvia not heeding his interruption
there is one strange thing You are always there Maurice

Come thats all right says Maurice

Ah but not kind and good as you are Captain Bruin but scowling and
threatening and angry so that I am afraid of you

But that is only a dream darling

Yes but playing with the button of his coat

But what

But you looked just so today in the Court Maurice and I think thats
what made me so silly

My darling There hushdont cry

But she had burst into a passion of sobs and tears that shook her
slight figure in his arms

Oh Maurice I am a wicked girl I dont know my own mind I think
sometimes I dont love you as I oughtyou who have saved me and nursed
me

There never mind about that muttered Maurice Frere with a sort of
choking in his throat

She grew more composed presently and said after a while lifting her
face Tell me Maurice did you ever in those days of which you have
spoken to mewhen you nursed me as a little child in your arms and fed
me and starved for medid you ever think we should be married

I dont know says Maurice Why

I think you must have thought so becauseits not vanity dearyou
would not else have been so kind and gentle and devoted

Nonsense Poppet he said with his eyes resolutely averted

No but you have been and I am very pettish sometimes Papa has
spoiled me You are always affectionate and those worrying ways of
yours which I get angry at all come from love for me dont they

I hope so said Maurice with an unwonted moisture in his eyes

Well you see that is the reason why I am angry with myself for not
loving you as I ought I want you to like the things I like and to love
the books and the music and the pictures and thethe World I love
and I forget that you are a man you know and I am only a girl and I
forget how nobly you behaved Maurice and how unselfishly you risked
your life for mine Why what is the matter dear

He had put her away from him suddenly and gone to the window gazing
across the sloping garden at the bay below sleeping in the soft evening
light The schooner which had brought the witnesses from Port Arthur lay
off the shore and the yellow flag at her mast fluttered gently in the
cool evening breeze The sight of this flag appeared to anger him for
as his eyes fell on it he uttered an impatient exclamation and turned
round again

Maurice she cried I have wounded you

No no It is nothing said he with the air of a man surprised in
a moment of weakness II did not like to hear you talk in this
wayabout not loving me

Oh forgive me dear I did not mean to hurt you It is my silly way of
saying more than I mean How could I do otherwise than love youafter
all you have done

Some sudden desperate whim caused him to exclaim But suppose I had not
done all you think would you not love me still

Her eyes raised to his face with anxious tenderness for the pain she
had believed herself to have inflicted fell at this speech

What a question I dont know I suppose I should yetbut what is the
use Maurice of supposing I know you have done it and that is enough
How can I say what I might have done if something else had happened
Why you might not have loved me

If there had been for a moment any sentiment of remorse in his selfish
heart the hesitation of her answer went far to dispel it

To be sure thats true and he placed his arm round her

She lifted her face again with a bright laugh

We are a pair of geesesupposing How can we help what has past We
have the Future darlingthe Future in which I am to be your little
wife and we are to love each other all our lives like the people in
the storybooks

Temptation to evil had often come to Maurice Frere and his selfish
nature had succumbed to it when in far less witching shape than this
fair and innocent child luring him with wistful eyes to win her What
hopes had he not built upon her love what good resolutions had he not
made by reason of the purity and goodness she was to bring to him As
she said the past was beyond recall the futurein which she was
to love him all her lifewas before them With the hypocrisy of
selfishness which deceives even itself he laid the little head upon his
heart with a sensible glow of virtue

God bless you darling You are my Good Angel

The girl sighed I will be your Good Angel dear if you will let me




CHAPTER VI MR MEEKIN ADMINISTERS CONSOLATION



Rex told Mr Meekin who the next day did him the honour to visit
him that under Providence he owed his escape from death to the kind
manner in which Captain Frere had spoken of him

I hope your escape will be a warning to you my man said Mr Meekin
and that you will endeavour to make the rest of your life thus spared
by the mercy of Providence an atonement for your early errors

Indeed I will sir said John Rex who had taken Mr Meekins measure
very accurately and it is very kind of you to condescend to speak so
to a wretch like me

Not at all said Meekin with affability it is my duty I am a
Minister of the Gospel

Ah sir I wish I had attended to the Gospels teachings when I was
younger I might have been saved from all this

You might indeed poor man but the Divine Mercy is infinitequite
infinite and will be extended to all of usto you as well as to me
This with the air of saying What do you think of that Remember
the penitent thief Rexthe penitent thief

Indeed I do sir

And read your Bible Rex and pray for strength to bear your
punishment

I will Mr Meekin I need it sorely sirphysical as well as
spiritual strength sirfor the Government allowance is sadly
insufficient

I will speak to the authorities about a change in your dietary scale
returned Meekin patronizingly In the meantime just collect together
in your mind those particulars of your adventures of which you spoke
and have them ready for me when next I call Such a remarkable history
ought not to be lost

Thank you kindly sir I will sir Ah I little thought when I
occupied the position of a gentleman Mr Meekinthe cunning scoundrel
had been piously grandiloquent concerning his past careerthat I
should be reduced to this But it is only just sir

The mysterious workings of Providence are always just Rex returned
Meekin who preferred to speak of the Almighty with wellbred vagueness

I am glad to see you so conscious of your errors Good morning

Good morning and Heaven bless you sir said Rex with his tongue in
his cheek for the benefit of his yard mates and so Mr Meekin tripped
gracefully away convinced that he was labouring most successfully in
the Vineyard and that the convict Rex was really a superior person

I will send his narrative to the Bishop said he to himself It will
amuse him There must be many strange histories here if one could but
find them out

As the thought passed through his brain his eye fell upon the
notorious Dawes who while waiting for the schooner to take him back
to Port Arthur had been permitted to amuse himself by breaking stones
The prisonshed which Mr Meekin was visiting was long and low roofed
with iron and terminating at each end in the stone wall of the gaol At
one side rose the cells at the other the outer wall of the prison From
the outer wall projected a weatherboard underroof and beneath this
were seated forty heavilyironed convicts Two constables with loaded
carbines walked up and down the clear space in the middle and another
watched from a sort of sentrybox built against the main wall Every
halfhour a third constable went down the line and examined the irons
The admirable system of solitary confinementwhich in average cases
produces insanity in the space of twelve monthswas as yet unknown in
Hobart Town and the forty heavilyironed men had the pleasure of seeing
each others faces every day for six hours

The other inmates of the prison were at work on the roads or otherwise
bestowed in the day time but the forty were judged too desperate to be
let loose They sat three feet apart in two long lines each man with
a heap of stones between his outstretched legs and cracked the pebbles
in leisurely fashion The double row of dismal woodpeckers tapping at
this terribly hollow beechtree of penal discipline had a semiludicrous
appearance It seemed so painfully absurd that forty muscular men should
be ironed and guarded for no better purpose than the cracking of a
cartload of quartzpebbles In the meantime the air was heavy with angry
glances shot from one to the other and the passage of the parson
was hailed by a grumbling undertone of blasphemy It was considered
fashionable to grunt when the hammer came in contact with the stone and
under cover of this mock exclamation of fatigue it was convenient
to launch an oath A fanciful visitor seeing the irregularly rising
hammers along the line might have likened the shed to the interior of
some vast piano whose notes an unseen hand was erratically fingering
Rufus Dawes was seated last on the linehis back to the cells his face
to the gaol wall This was the place nearest the watching constable
and was allotted on that account to the most illfavoured Some of his
companions envied him that melancholy distinction

Well Dawes says Mr Meekin measuring with his eye the distance
between the prisoner and himself as one might measure the chain of some
ferocious dog How are you this morning Dawes

Dawes scowling in a parenthesis between the cracking of two stones was
understood to say that he was very well

I am afraid Dawes said Mr Meekin reproachfully that you have done
yourself no good by your outburst in court on Monday I understand that
public opinion is quite incensed against you

Dawes slowly arranging one large fragment of bluestone in a comfortable
basin of smaller fragments made no reply

I am afraid you lack patience Dawes You do not repent of your
offences against the law I fear

The only answer vouchsafed by the ironed manif answer it could be
calledwas a savage blow which split the stone into sudden fragments
and made the clergyman skip a step backward

You are a hardened ruffian sir Do you not hear me speak to you

I hear you said Dawes picking up another stone

Then listen respectfully sir said Meekin roseate with celestial
anger You have all day to break those stones

Yes I have all day returned Rufus Dawes with a dogged look
upward and all next day for that matter Ugh and again the hammer
descended

I came to console you manto console you says Meekin indignant at
the contempt with which his wellmeant overtures had been received I
wanted to give you some good advice

The selfimportant annoyance of the tone seemed to appeal to whatever
vestige of appreciation for the humorous chains and degradation had
suffered to linger in the convicts brain for a faint smile crossed his
features

I beg your pardon sir he said Pray go on

I was going to say my good fellow that you have done yourself a great
deal of injury by your illadvised accusation of Captain Frere and the
use you made of Miss Vickerss name

A frown as of pain contracted the prisoners brows and he seemed
with difficulty to put a restraint upon his speech Is there to be
no inquiry Mr Meekin he asked at length What I stated was the
truththe truth so help me God

No blasphemy sir said Meekin solemnly No blasphemy wretched man
Do not add to the sin of lying the greater sin of taking the name of the
Lord thy God in vain He will not hold him guiltless Dawes He will not
hold him guiltless remember No there is to be no inquiry

Are they not going to ask her for her story asked Dawes with a
pitiful change of manner They told me that she was to be asked Surely
they will ask her

I am not perhaps at liberty said Meekin placidly unconscious of
the agony of despair and rage that made the voice of the strong man
before him quiver to state the intentions of the authorities but I
can tell you that Miss Vickers will not be asked anything about you You
are to go back to Port Arthur on the 24th and to remain there

A groan burst from Rufus Dawes a groan so full of torture that even the
comfortable Meekin was thrilled by it

It is the Law you know my good man I cant help it he said You
shouldnt break the Law you know

Curse the Law cries Dawes Its a Bloody Law itsthere I beg
your pardon and he fell to cracking his stones again with a laugh
that was more terrible in its bitter hopelessness of winning attention
or sympathy than any outburst of passion could have been

Come says Meekin feeling uneasily constrained to bring forth some of
his Londonlearnt platitudes You cant complain You have broken the
Law and you must suffer Civilized Society says you shant do certain
things and if you do them you must suffer the penalty Civilized
Society imposes You are not wanting in intelligence Dawes mores the
pityand you cant deny the justice of that

Rufus Dawes as if disdaining to answer in words cast his eyes round
the yard with a glance that seemed to ask grimly if Civilized Society
was progressing quite in accordance with justice when its civilization
created such places as that stonewalled carbineguarded prisonshed
and filled it with such creatures as those forty human beasts doomed to
spend the best years of their manhood cracking pebbles in it

You dont deny that asked the smug parson do you Dawes

Its not my place to argue with you sir said Dawes in a tone of
indifference born of lengthened suffering so nicely balanced between
contempt and respect that the inexperienced Meekin could not tell
whether he had made a convert or subjected himself to an impertinence
but Im a prisoner for life and dont look at it in the same way that
you do

This view of the question did not seem to have occurred to Mr Meekin
for his mild cheek flushed Certainly the fact of being a prisoner for
life did make some difference The sound of the noonday bell however
warned him to cease argument and to take his consolations out of the
way of the mustering prisoners

With a great clanking and clashing of irons the forty rose and stood
each by his stoneheap The third constable came round rapping the
legirons of each man with easy nonchalance and roughly pulling up the
coarse trousers made with buttoned flaps at the sides like Mexican
calzoneros in order to give free play to the ankle fetters so that
he might assure himself that no tricks had been played since his last
visit As each man passed this ordeal he saluted and clanked with
widespread legs to the place in the double line Mr Meekin though
not a patron of field sports found something in the scene that reminded
him of a blacksmith picking up horses feet to examine the soundness of
their shoes

Upon my word he said to himself with a momentary pang of genuine
compassion it is a dreadful way to treat human beings I dont wonder
at that wretched creature groaning under it But bless me it is near
one oclock and I promised to lunch with Major Vickers at two How time
flies to be sure




CHAPTER VII RUFUS DAWESS IDYLL



That afternoon while Mr Meekin was digesting his lunch and chatting
airily with Sylvia Rufus Dawes began to brood over a desperate scheme
The intelligence that the investigation he had hoped for was not to be
granted to him had rendered doubly bitter those galling fetters of self
restraint which he had laid upon himself For five years of desolation
he had waited and hoped for a chance which might bring him to Hobart
Town and enable him to denounce the treachery of Maurice Frere He had
by an almost miraculous accident obtained that chance of open speech
and having obtained it he found that he was not allowed to speak
All the hopes he had formed were dashed to earth All the calmness
with which he had forced himself to bear his fate was now turned into
bitterest rage and fury Instead of one enemy he had twenty Alljudge
jury gaoler and parsonwere banded together to work him evil and deny
him right The whole world was his foe there was no honesty or truth in
any living creaturesave one

During the dull misery of his convict life at Port Arthur one bright
memory shone upon him like a star In the depth of his degradation
at the height of his despair he cherished one pure and ennobling
thoughtthe thought of the child whom he had saved and who loved him
When on board the whaler that had rescued him from the burning boat he
had felt that the sailors believing in Freres bluff lies shrunk from
the moody felon he had gained strength to be silent by thinking of the
suffering child When poor Mrs Vickers died making no sign and thus
the chief witness to his heroism perished before his eyes the thought
that the child was left had restrained his selfish regrets When Frere
handing him over to the authorities as an absconder ingeniously twisted
the details of the boatbuilding to his own glorification the knowledge
that Sylvia would assign to these pretensions their true value had given
him courage to keep silence So strong was his belief in her gratitude
that he scorned to beg for the pardon he had taught himself to believe
that she would ask for him So utter was his contempt for the coward and
boaster who dressed in brief authority bore insidious false witness
against him that when he heard his sentence of life banishment he
disdained to make known the true part he had played in the matter
preferring to wait for the more exquisite revenge the more complete
justification which would follow upon the recovery of the child from
her illness But when at Port Arthur day after day passed over and
brought no word of pity or justification he began with a sickening
feeling of despair to comprehend that something strange had happened
He was told by newcomers that the child of the Commandant lay still
and near to death Then he heard that she and her father had left the
colony and that all prospect of her righting him by her evidence was at
an end This news gave him a terrible pang and at first he was inclined
to break out into upbraidings of her selfishness But with that depth
of love which was in him albeit crusted over and concealed by the
sullenness of speech and manner which his sufferings had produced he
found excuses for her even then She was ill She was in the hands of
friends who loved her and disregarded him perhaps even her entreaties
and explanations were put aside as childish babblings She would free
him if she had the power Then he wrote Statements agonized to see
the Commandant pestered the gaolers and warders with the story of his
wrongs and inundated the Government with letters which containing as
they did always denunciations of Maurice Frere were never suffered to
reach their destination The authorities willing at the first to look
kindly upon him in consideration of his strange experience grew weary
of this perpetual iteration of what they believed to be malicious
falsehoods and ordered him heavier tasks and more continuous labour
They mistook his gloom for treachery his impatient outbursts of passion
at his fate for ferocity his silent endurance for dangerous cunning
As he had been at Macquarie Harbour so did he become at Port Arthura
marked man Despairing of winning his coveted liberty by fair means
and horrified at the hideous prospect of a life in chains he twice
attempted to escape but escape was even more hopeless than it had been
at Hells Gates The peninsula of Port Arthur was admirably guarded
signal stations drew a chain round the prison an armed boats crew
watched each bay and across the narrow isthmus which connected it with
the mainland was a cordon of watchdogs in addition to the soldier
guard He was retaken of course flogged and weighted with heavier
irons The second time they sent him to the Coal Mines where the
prisoners lived underground worked halfnaked and dragged their
inspecting gaolers in wagons upon iron tramways when such great people
condescended to visit them The day on which he started for this place
he heard that Sylvia was dead and his last hope went from him

Then began with him a new religion He worshipped the dead For the
living he had but hatred and evil words for the dead he had love and
tender thoughts Instead of the phantoms of his vanished youth which
were wont to visit him he saw now but one visionthe vision of the
child who had loved him Instead of conjuring up for himself pictures of
that home circle in which he had once moved and those creatures who in
the past years had thought him worthy of esteem and affection he placed
before himself but one idea one embodiment of happiness one being who
was without sin and without stain among all the monsters of that pit
into which he had fallen Around the figure of the innocent child who
had lain in his breast and laughed at him with her red young mouth
he grouped every image of happiness and love Having banished from his
thoughts all hope of resuming his name and place he pictured to himself
some quiet nook at the worlds enda deepgardened house in a German
country town or remote cottage by the English seashore where he and
his dreamchild might have lived together happier in a purer affection
than the love of man for woman He bethought him how he could have
taught her out of the strange store of learning which his roving life
had won for him how he could have confided to her his real name and
perhaps purchased for her wealth and honour by reason of it Yet he
thought she would not care for wealth and honour she would prefer
a quiet lifea life of unassuming usefulness a life devoted to good
deeds to charity and love He could see herin his visionsreading by
a cheery fireside wandering in summer woods or lingering by the marge
of the slumbering midday sea He could feelin his dreamsher soft
arms about his neck her innocent kisses on his lips he could hear her
light laugh and see her sunny ringlets float backblown as she ran
to meet him Conscious that she was dead and that he did to her gentle
memory no disrespect by linking her fortunes to those of a wretch who
had seen so much of evil as himself he loved to think of her as still
living and to plot out for her and for himself impossible plans for
future happiness In the noisome darkness of the mine in the glaring
light of the noondaydragging at his loaded wagon he could see her
ever with him her calm eyes gazing lovingly on his as they had gazed
in the boat so long ago She never seemed to grow older she never
seemed to wish to leave him It was only when his misery became too
great for him to bear and he cursed and blasphemed mingling for a
time in the hideous mirth of his companions that the little figure fled
away Thus dreaming he had shaped out for himself a sorrowful comfort
and in his dreamworld found a compensation for the terrible affliction
of living Indifference to his present sufferings took possession of
him only at the bottom of this indifference lurked a fixed hatred of
the man who had brought these sufferings upon him and a determination
to demand at the first opportunity a reconsideration of that mans
claims to be esteemed a hero It was in this mood that he had intended
to make the revelation which he had made in Court but the intelligence
that Sylvia lived unmanned him and his prepared speech had been usurped
by a passionate torrent of complaint and invective which convinced no
one and gave Frere the very argument he needed It was decided that the
prisoner Dawes was a malicious and artful scoundrel whose only object
was to gain a brief respite of the punishment which he had so justly
earned Against this injustice he had resolved to rebel It was
monstrous he thought that they should refuse to hear the witness who
was so ready to speak in his favour infamous that they should send him
back to his doom without allowing her to say a word in his defence But
he would defeat that scheme He had planned a method of escape and he
would break from his bonds fling himself at her feet and pray her to
speak the truth for him and so save him Strong in his faith in her
and with his love for her brightened by the love he had borne to her
dreamimage he felt sure of her power to rescue him now as he had
rescued her before If she knew I was alive she would come to me he
said I am sure she would Perhaps they told her that I was dead

Meditating that night in the solitude of his cellhis evil character
had gained him the poor luxury of lonelinesshe almost wept to think of
the cruel deception that had doubtless been practised on her They have
told her that I was dead in order that she might learn to forget me
but she could not do that I have thought of her so often during these
weary years that she must sometimes have thought of me Five years
She must be a woman now My little child a woman Yet she is sure to be
childlike sweet and gentle How she will grieve when she hears of my
sufferings Oh my darling my darling you are not dead And then
looking hastily about him in the darkness as though fearful even there
of being seen he pulled from out his breast a little packet and felt
it lovingly with his coarse toilworn fingers reverently raising it to
his lips and dreaming over it with a smile on his face as though it
were a sacred talisman that should open to him the doors of freedom




CHAPTER VIII AN ESCAPE



A few days after thison the 23rd of DecemberMaurice Frere was
alarmed by a piece of startling intelligence The notorious Dawes had
escaped from gaol

Captain Frere had inspected the prison that very afternoon and it had
seemed to him that the hammers had never fallen so briskly nor the
chains clanked so gaily as on the occasion of his visit Thinking
of their Christmas holiday the dogs he had said to the patrolling
warder Thinking about their Christmas pudding the luxurious
scoundrels and the convict nearest him had laughed appreciatively as
convicts and schoolboys do laugh at the jests of the man in authority
All seemed contentment Moreover he hadby way of a pleasant stroke
of wittormented Rufus Dawes with his illfortune The schooner sails
tomorrow my man he had said youll spend your Christmas at the
mines And congratulated himself upon the fact that Rufus Dawes
merely touched his cap and went on with his stonecracking in silence
Certainly double irons and hard labour were fine things to break a mans
spirit So that when in the afternoon of that same day he heard the
astounding news that Rufus Dawes had freed himself from his fetters
climbed the gaol wall in broad daylight run the gauntlet of Macquarie
Street and was now supposed to be safely hidden in the mountains he
was dumbfounded

How the deuce did he do it Jenkins he asked as soon as he reached
the yard

Well Im blessed if I rightly know your honour says Jenkins He
was over the wall before you could say knife Scott fired and missed
him and then I heard the sentrys musket but he missed him too

Missed him cries Frere Pretty fellows you are all of you I
suppose you couldnt hit a haystack at twenty yards Why the man wasnt
three feet from the end of your carbine

The unlucky Scott standing in melancholy attitude by the empty irons
muttered something about the sun having been in his eyes I dont know
how it was sir I ought to have hit him for certain I think I did
touch him too as he went up the wall

A stranger to the customs of the place might have imagined that he was
listening to a conversation about a pigeon match

Tell me all about it says Frere with an angry curse I was just
turning your honour when I hears Scott sing out Hullo and when I
turned round I saw Dawess irons on the ground and him ascrambling
up the heap o stones yonder The two men on my right jumped up and
I thought it was a madeup thing among em so I covered em with my
carbine according to instructions and called out that Id shoot the
first that stepped out Then I heard Scotts piece and the men gave a
shout like When I looked round he was gone

Nobody else moved

No sir I was confused at first and thought they were all in it but
Parton and Haines they runs in and gets between me and the wall and
then Mr Short he come and we examined their irons

All right

All right your honour and they all swore they knowed nothing of it I
know Dawess irons was all right when he went to dinner

Frere stopped and examined the empty fetters All right be hanged he
said If you dont know your duty better than this the sooner you go
somewhere else the better my man Look here

The two ankle fetters were severed One had been evidently filed
through and the other broken transversely The latter was bent as from
a violent blow

Dont know where he got the file from said Warder Short

Know Of course you dont know You men never do know anything until
the mischiefs done You want me here for a month or so Id teach you
your duty Dont knowwith things like this lying about I wonder the
whole yard isnt loose and dining with the Governor

This was a fragment of delft pottery which Freres quick eye had
detected among the broken metal

Id cut the biggest iron youve got with this and so would he and
plenty more Ill go bail You ought to have lived with me at Sarah
Island Mr Short Dont know

Well Captain Frere its an accident says Short and cant be
helped now

An accident roared Frere What business have you with accidents
How in the devils name you let the man get over the wall I dont
know

He ran up that stone heap says Scott and seemed to me to jump at
the roof of the shed I fired at him and he swung his legs over the top
of the wall and dropped

Frere measured the distance from his eye and an irrepressible feeling
of admiration rising out of his own skill in athletics took possession
of him for an instant

By the Lord Harry but its a big jump he said and then the
instinctive fear with which the consciousness of the hideous wrong
he had done the now escaped convict inspired him made him add A
desperate villain like that wouldnt stick at a murder if you pressed
him hard Which way did he go

Right up Macquarie Street and then made for the mountain There were
few people about but Mr Mays of the Star Hotel tried to stop him
and was knocked head over heels He says the fellow runs like a deer

Well have the reward out if we dont get him tonight says Frere
turning away and youd better put on an extra warder This sort of
game is catching And he strode away to the Barracks

From right to left from east to west through the prison city flew the
signal of alarm and the patrol clattering out along the road to New
Norfolk made hot haste to strike the trail of the fugitive But night
came and found him yet at large and the patrol returning weary and
disheartened protested that he must be lying hid in some gorge of the
purple mountain that overshadowed the town and would have to be starved
into submission Meanwhile the usual message ran through the island
and so admirable were the arrangements which Arthur the reformer had
initiated that before noon of the next day not a signal station on
the coast but knew that No 8942 etc etc prisoner for life was
illegally at large This intelligence further aided by a paragraph in
the Gazette anent the Daring Escape noised abroad the world cared
little that the Mary Jane Government schooner had sailed for Port
Arthur without Rufus Dawes

But two or three persons cared a good deal Major Vickers for one was
indignant that his boasted security of bolts and bars should have been
so easily defied and in proportion to his indignation was the grief of
Messieurs Jenkins Scott and Co suspended from office and threatened
with absolute dismissal Mr Meekin was terribly frightened at the fact
that so dangerous a monster should be roaming at large within reach of
his own saintly person Sylvia had shown symptoms of nervous terror
none the less injurious because carefully repressed and Captain Maurice
Frere was a prey to the most cruel anxiety He had ridden off at a
handgallop within ten minutes after he had reached the Barracks and
had spent the few hours of remaining daylight in scouring the country
along the road to the North At dawn the next day he was away to the
mountain and with a blacktracker at his heels explored as much of
that wilderness of gully and chasm as nature permitted to him He had
offered to double the reward and had examined a number of suspicious
persons It was known that he had been inspecting the prison a few hours
before the escape took place and his efforts were therefore attributed
to zeal not unmixed with chagrin Our dear friend feels his reputation
at stake the future chaplain of Port Arthur said to Sylvia at the
Christmas dinner He is so proud of his knowledge of these unhappy men
that he dislikes to be outwitted by any of them

Notwithstanding all this however Dawes had disappeared The fat
landlord of the Star Hotel was the last person who saw him and the
flying yellow figure seemed to have been as completely swallowed up by
the warm summers afternoon as if it had run headlong into the blackest
night that ever hung above the earth




CHAPTER IX JOHN REXS LETTER HOME



The little gathering of which Major Vickers had spoken to Mr Meekin
had grown into something larger than he had anticipated Instead of a
quiet dinner at which his own household his daughters betrothed and
the stranger clergyman only should be present the Major found himself
entangled with Mesdames Protherick and Jellicoe Mr McNab of the
garrison and Mr Pounce of the civil list His quiet Christmas dinner
had grown into an evening party

The conversation was on the usual topic

Heard anything about that fellow Dawes asked Mr Pounce

Not yet says Frere sulkily but he wont be out long Ive got a
dozen men up the mountain

I suppose it is not easy for a prisoner to make good his escape says
Meekin

Oh he neednt be caught says Frere if thats what you mean but
hell starve instead The bushranging days are over now and its a
precious poor lookout for any man to live upon luck in the bush

Indeed yes says Mr Pounce lapping his soup This island seems
specially adapted by Providence for a convict settlement for with an
admirable climate it carries little indigenous vegetation which will
support human life

Wull said McNab to Sylvia I dont think Prauvidence had any thocht
o caunveect deesiplin whun He created the cauleny o Van Deemens
Lan

Neither do I said Sylvia

I dont know says Mrs Protherick Poor Protherick used often to
say that it seemed as if some Almighty Hand had planned the Penal
Settlements round the coast the country is so delightfully barren

Ay Port Arthur couldnt have been better if it had been made on
purpose says Frere and all up the coast from Tenby to St Helens
there isnt a scrap for human being to make a meal on The West Coast is
worse By George sir in the old days I remember

By the way says Meekin Ive got something to show you Rexs
confession I brought it down on purpose

Rexs confession

His account of his adventures after he left Macquarie Harbour I am
going to send it to the Bishop

Oh I should like to see it said Sylvia with heightened colour The
story of these unhappy men has a personal interest for me

A forbidden subject Poppet

No papa not altogether forbidden for it does not affect me now as it
used to do You must let me read it Mr Meekin

A pack of lies I expect said Frere with a scowl That scoundrel
Rex couldnt tell the truth to save his life

You misjudge him Captain Frere said Meekin All the prisoners are
not hardened in iniquity like Rufus Dawes Rex is I believe truly
penitent and has written a most touching letter to his father

A letter said Vickers You know that by the Kingsno the
Queens Regulations no letters are allowed to be sent to the friends of
prisoners without first passing through the hands of the authorities

I am aware of that Major and for that reason have brought it with me
that you may read it for yourself It seems to me to breathe a spirit of
true piety

Lets have a look at it said Frere

Here it is returned Meekin producing a packet and when the cloth
is removed I will ask permission of the ladies to read it aloud It is
most interesting

A glance of surprise passed between the ladies Protherick and Jellicoe
The idea of a convicts letter proving interesting Mr Meekin was new
to the ways of the place

Frere turning the packet between his finger read the address

John Rex sen Care of Mr Blicks 38 Bishopsgate Street Within
London

Why cant he write to his father direct said he Whos Blick

A worthy merchant I am told in whose countinghouse the fortunate
Rex passed his younger days He had a tolerable education as you are
aware

Educated prisoners are always the worst said Vickers James some
more wine We dont drink toasts here but as this is Christmas Eve
Her Majesty the Queen

Hear hear hear says Maurice Her Majesty the Queen

Having drunk this loyal toast with due fervour Vickers proposed His
Excellency Sir John Franklin which toast was likewise duly honoured

Heres a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you sir said Frere
with the letter still in his hand God bless us all

Amen says Meekin piously Let us hope He will and now leddies the
letter I will read you the Confession afterwards Opening the packet
with the satisfaction of a Gospel vineyard labourer who sees his first
vine sprouting the good creature began to read aloud

Hobart Town December 27 1838 My Dear FatherThrough all the
chances changes and vicissitudes of my chequered life I never had a
task so painful to my mangled feelings as the present one of addressing
you from this doleful spotmy seagirt prison on the beach of which I
stand a monument of destruction driven by the adverse winds of fate to
the confines of black despair and into the vortex of galling misery

Poetical said Frere

I am just like a gigantic tree of the forest which has stood many a
wintry blast and stormy tempest but now alas I am become a withered
trunk with all my greenest and tenderest branches lopped off Though
fast attaining middle age I am not filling an envied and honoured
post with credit and respect NoI shall be soon wearing the garb of
degradation and the badge and brand of infamy at PA which is being
interpreted Port Arthur the Villains Home

Poor fellow said Sylvia

Touching is it not assented Meekin continuing

I am with heartrending sorrow and anguish of soul ranged and mingled
with the Outcasts of Society My present circumstances and pictures you
will find well and truly drawn in the 102nd Psalm commencing with the
4th verse to the 12th inclusive which my dear father I request you
will read attentively before you proceed any further

Hullo said Frere pulling out his pocketbook whats that Read
those numbers again Mr Meekin complied and Frere grinned Go on
he said Ill show you something in that letter directly

Oh my dear father avoid I beg of you the reading of profane books
Let your mind dwell upon holy things and assiduously study to grow
in grace Psalm lxxiii 2 Yet I have hope even in this my desolate
condition Psalm xxxv 18 For the Lord our God is merciful and
inclineth His ear unto pity

Blasphemous dog said Vickers You dont believe all that Meekin do
you The parson reproved him gently Wait a moment sir until I have
finished

Party spirit runs very high even in prison in Van Diemens Land I
am sorry to say that a licentious press invariably evinces a very great
degree of contumely while the authorities are held in respect by all
welldisposed persons though it is often endeavoured by some to bring
on them the hatred and contempt of prisoners But I am glad to tell you
that all their efforts are without avail but nevertheless do not read
in any colonial newspaper There is so much scurrility and vituperation
in their productions

Thats for your benefit Frere said Vickers with a smile You
remember what was said about your presence at the race meetings

Of course said Frere Artful scoundrel Go on Mr Meekin pray

I am aware that you will hear accounts of cruelty and tyranny said
by the malicious and the evilminded haters of the Government and
Government officials to have been inflicted by gaolers on convicts To
be candid this is not the dreadful place it has been represented to be
by vindictive writers Severe flogging and heavy chaining is sometimes
used no doubt but only in rare cases and nominal punishments are
marked out by law for slight breaches of discipline So far as I have an
opportunity of judging the lash is never bestowed unless merited

As far as he is concerned I dont doubt it said Frere cracking a
walnut

The texts of Scripture quoted by our chaplain have comforted me much
and I have much to be grateful for for after the rash attempt I made to
secure my freedom I have reason to be thankful for the mercy shown to
me Deathdreadful death of soul and bodywould have been my portion
but by the mercy of Omnipotence I have been spared to repentanceJohn
iii I have now come to bitterness The chaplain a pious gentleman
says it never really pays to steal Lay up for yourselves treasures in
Heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt Honesty is the
best policy I am convinced and I would not for L1000 repeat my evil
coursesPsalm xxxviii 14 When I think of the happy days I once passed
with good Mr Blicks in the old house in Blue Anchor Yard and reflect
that since that happy time I have recklessly plunged in sin and stolen
goods and watches studs rings and jewellery become indeed a common
thief I tremble with remorse and fly to prayerPsalm v Oh what
sinners we are Let me hope that now I by Gods blessing placed beyond
temptation will live safely and that some day I even may by the will
of the Lord Jesus find mercy for my sins Some kind of madness has
method in it but madness of sin holds us without escape Such is dear
father then my hope and trust for my remaining life herePsalm c 74
I owe my bodily wellbeing to Captain Maurice Frere who was good enough
to speak of my conduct in reference to the Osprey when with Shiers
Barker and others we captured that vessel Pray for Captain Frere my
dear father He is a good man and though his public duty is painful and
trying to his feelings yet as a public functionary he could not allow
his private feelings whether of mercy or revenge to step between him
and his duty

Confound the rascal said Frere growing crimson

Remember me most affectionately to Sarah and little William and
all friends who yet cherish the recollection of me and bid them take
warning by my fate and keep from evil courses A good conscience is
better than gold and no amount can compensate for the misery incident
to a return to crime Whether I shall ever see you again dear father
is more than uncertain for my doom is life unless the Government
alter their plans concerning me and allow me an opportunity to earn my
freedom by hard work

The blessing of God rest with you my dear father and that you may be
washed white in the blood of the Lamb is the prayer of your

Unfortunate Son John Rex PSThough your sins be as scarlet
they shall be whiter than snow

Is that all said Frere

That is all sir and a very touching letter it is

So it is said Frere Now let me have it a moment Mr Meekin

He took the paper and referring to the numbers of the texts which he
had written in his pocketbook began to knit his brows over Mr John
Rexs impious and hypocritical production I thought so he said at
length Those texts were never written for nothing Its an old trick
but cleverly done

What do you mean said Meekin Mean cries Frere with a smile at
his own acuteness This precious composition contains a very gratifying
piece of intelligence for Mr Blicks whoever he is Some receiver Ive
no doubt Look here Mr Meekin Take the letter and this pencil and
begin at the first text The 102nd Psalm from the 4th verse to the
12th inclusive doesnt he say Very good thats nine verses isnt
it Well now underscore nine consecutive words from the second word
immediately following the next text quoted I have hope etc Have you
got it

Yes says Meekin astonished while all heads bent over the table

Well now his text is the eighteenth verse of the thirtyfifth Psalm
isnt it Count eighteen words on then underscore five consecutive
ones Youve done that

A momentsixteenseventeeneighteen authorities

Count and score in the same way until you come to the word Texts
somewhere Vickers Ill trouble you for the claret

Yes said Meekin after a pause Here it isthe texts of Scripture
quoted by our chaplain But surely Mr Frere

Hold on a bit now cries Frere Whats the next quotationJohn
iii Thats every third word Score every third word beginning with I
immediately following the text now until you come to a quotation Got
it How many words in it

Lay up for yourselves treasures in Heaven where neither moth nor rust
doth corrupt said Meekin a little scandalized Fourteen words

Count fourteen words on then and score the fourteenth Im up to this
textquoting business

The word L1000 said Meekin Yes

Then theres another text Thirtyeighthisnt itPsalm and the
fourteenth verse Do that the same way as the othercount fourteen
words and then score eight in succession Where does that bring you

The fifth Psalm

Every fifth word then Go on my dear sirgo on Method of escape
yes The hundredth Psalm means a full stop What verse Seventyfour
Count seventyfour words and score

There was a pause for a few minutes while Mr Meekin counted The letter
had really turned out interesting

Read out your marked words now Meekin Lets see if Im right Mr
Meekin read with gradually crimsoning face

I have hope even in this my desolate condition in prison Van
Diemens Land the authorities are held in hatred and contempt of
prisoners read in any colonial newspaper accounts of cruelty and
tyranny inflicted by gaolers on convicts severe flogging and
heavy chaining for slight breaches of disciplineI come the
pious it paysL1000 in the old house in Blue Anchor
Yard stolen goods and watches studs rings and
jewellery are now placed safelyI
will find some method of escape then for revenge

Well said Maurice looking round with a grin what do you think of
that

Most remarkable said Mr Pounce

How did you find it out Frere

Oh its nothing says Frere meaning that it was a great deal Ive
studied a good many of these things and this one is clumsy to some Ive
seen But its pious isnt it Meekin

Mr Meekin arose in wrath

Its very ungracious on your part Captain Frere A capital joke
I have no doubt but permit me to say I do not like jesting on such
matters This poor fellows letter to his aged father to be made the
subject of heartless merriment I confess I do not understand It was
confided to me in my sacred character as a Christian pastor

Thats just it The fellows play upon the parsons dont you know and
under cover of your sacred character play all kinds of pranks How the
dog must have chuckled when he gave you that

Captain Frere said Mr Meekin changing colour like a chameleon
with indignation and rage your interpretation is I am convinced an
incorrect one How could the poor man compose such an ingenious piece of
cryptography

If you mean fake up that paper returned Frere unconsciously
dropping into prison slang Ill tell you He had a Bible I suppose
while he was writing

I certainly permitted him the use of the Sacred Volume Captain Frere
I should have judged it inconsistent with the character of my Office to
have refused it to him

Of course And thats just where you parsons are always putting your
foot into it If youd put your Office into your pocket and open your
eyes a bit

Maurice My dear Maurice

I beg your pardon Meekin says Maurice with clumsy apology but I
know these fellows Ive lived among em I came out in a ship with
em Ive talked with em and drank with em and Im down to all their
moves dont you see The Bible is the only book they get hold of and
texts are the only bits of learning ever taught m and being chockfull
of villainy and plots and conspiracies what other book should they make
use of to aid their infernal schemes but the one that the chaplain has
made a text book for em And Maurice rose in disgust not unmixed with
selflaudation

Dear me it is really very terrible says Meekin who was not
illmeaning but only selfcomplacentvery terrible indeed

But unhappily true said Mr Pounce An olive Thanks

Upon me soul burst out honest McNab the hail seestem seems to be
maist illcalculated tae advance the wark o reeformation

Mr McNab Ill trouble you for the port said equally honest Vickers
bound hand and foot in the chains of the rules of the services And
so what seemed likely to become a dangerous discussion upon convict
discipline was stifled judiciously at the birth But Sylvia prompted
perhaps by curiosity perhaps by a desire to modify the parsons
chagrin in passing Mr Meekin took up the confession that lay
unopened beside his wine glass and bore it off

Come Mr Meekin said Vickers when the door closed behind the
ladies help yourself I am sorry the letter turned out so strangely
but you may rely on Frere I assure you He knows more about convicts
than any man on the island

I see Captain Frere that you have studied the criminal classes

So I have my dear sir and know every turn and twist among em I tell
you my maxim Its some French fellows too I believe but that dont
matterdivide to conquer Set all the dogs spying on each other

Oh said Meekin Its the only way Why my dear sir if the
prisoners were as faithful to each other as we are we couldnt hold
the island a week Its just because no man can trust his neighbour that
every mutiny falls to the ground

I suppose it must be so said poor Meekin

It is so and by George sir if I had my way Id have it so that no
prisoner should say a word to his right hand man but his left hand man
should tell me of it Id promote the men that peached and make the
beggars their own warders Ha ha

But such a course Captain Frere though perhaps useful in a certain
way would surely produce harm It would excite the worst passions of
our fallen nature and lead to endless lying and tyranny Im sure it
would

Wait a bit cries Frere Perhaps one of these days Ill get a chance
and then Ill try it Convicts By the Lord Harry sir theres only one
way to treat em give em tobacco when they behave emselves and flog
em when they dont

Terrible says the clergyman with a shudder You speak of them as if
they were wild beasts

So they are said Maurice Frere calmly




CHAPTER X WHAT BECAME OF THE MUTINEERS OF THE OSPREY



At the bottom of the long luxuriant gardenground was a rustic seat
abutting upon the low wall that topped the lane The branches of the
English trees planted long ago hung above it and between their
rustling boughs one could see the reach of the silver river Sitting
with her face to the bay and her back to the house Sylvia opened the
manuscript she had carried off from Meekin and began to read It was
written in a firm large hand and headed

A NARRATIVE OF THE SUFFERINGS AND ADVENTURES OF CERTAIN OF THE TEN
CONVICTS WHO SEIZED THE BRIG OSPREY AT MACQUARIE HARBOUR IN VAN
DIEMENS LAND RELATED BY ONE OF THE SAID CONVICTS WHILE LYING UNDER
SENTENCE FOR THIS OFFENCE IN THE GAOL AT HOBART TOWN

Sylvia having read this grandiloquent sentence paused for a moment
The story of the mutiny which had been the chief event of her
childhood lay before her and it seemed to her that were it related
truly she would comprehend something strange and terrible which had
been for many years a shadow upon her memory Longing and yet fearing
to proceed she held the paper half unfolded in her hand as in her
childhood she had held ajar the door of some dark room into which she
longed and yet feared to enter Her timidity lasted but an instant


     


When orders arrived from headquarters to break up the penal settlement
of Macquarie Harbour the Commandant Major Vickers th Regiment and
most of the prisoners embarked on board a colonial vessel and set
sail for Hobart Town leaving behind them a brig that had been built at
Macquarie Harbour to be brought round after them and placing Captain
Maurice Frere in command Left aboard her was Mr Bates who had acted
as pilot at the settlement also four soldiers and ten prisoners as
a crew to work the vessel The Commandants wife and child were also
aboard


     


How strangely it reads thought the girl


     


On the 12th of January 1834 we set sail and in the afternoon
anchored safely outside the Gates but a breeze setting in from
the northwest caused a swell on the Bar and Mr Bates ran back to
Wellington Bay We remained there all next day and in the afternoon
Captain Frere took two soldiers and a boat and went afishing There
were then only Mr Bates and the other two soldiers aboard and it
was proposed by William Cheshire to seize the vessel I was at first
unwilling thinking that loss of life might ensue but Cheshire and the
others knowing that I was acquainted with navigationhaving in happier
days lived much on the seathreatened me if I refused to join A song
was started in the folksle and one of the soldiers coming to listen
to it was seized and Lyon and Riley then made prisoner of the
sentry Forced thus into a project with which I had at first but little
sympathy I felt my heart leap at the prospect of freedom and would
have sacrificed all to obtain it Maddened by the desperate hopes that
inspired me I from that moment assumed the command of my wretched
companions and honestly think that however culpable I may have been in
the eyes of the law I prevented them from the display of a violence to
which their savage life had unhappily made them but too accustomed


     


Poor fellow said Sylvia beguiled by Master Rexs specious
paragraphs I think he was not to blame


     


Mr Bates was below in the cabin and on being summoned by Cheshire to
surrender with great courage attempted a defence Barker fired at him
through the skylight but fearful of the lives of the Commandants
wife and child I struck up his musket and the ball passed through the
mouldings of the stern windows At the same time the soldiers whom we
had bound in the folksle forced up the hatch and came on deck Cheshire
shot the first one and struck the other with his clubbed musket The
wounded man lost his footing and the brig lurching with the rising
tide he fell into the sea This wasby the blessing of Godthe only
life lost in the whole affair

Mr Bates seeing now that we had possession of the deck surrendered
upon promise that the Commandants wife and child should be put ashore
in safety I directed him to take such matters as he needed and
prepared to lower the jollyboat As she swung off the davits Captain
Frere came alongside in the whaleboat and gallantly endeavoured to
board us but the boat drifted past the vessel I was now determined to
be freeindeed the minds of all on board were made up to carry through
the businessand hailing the whaleboat swore to fire into her unless
she surrendered Captain Frere refused and was for boarding us again
but the two soldiers joined with us and prevented his intention Having
now got the prisoners into the jollyboat we transferred Captain Frere
into her and being ourselves in the whaleboat compelled Captain Frere
and Mr Bates to row ashore We then took the jollyboat in tow and
returned to the brig a strict watch being kept for fear that they
should rescue the vessel from us

At break of day every man was upon deck and a consultation took place
concerning the parting of the provisions Cheshire was for leaving them
to starve but Lesly Shiers and I held out for an equal division
After a long and violent controversy Humanity gained the day and the
provisions were put into the whaleboat and taken ashore Upon the
receipt of the provisions Mr Bates thus expressed himself Men I did
not for one moment expect such kind treatment from you regarding the
provisions you have now brought ashore for us out of so little which
there was on board When I consider your present undertaking without
a competent navigator and in a leaky vessel your situation seems most
perilous therefore I hope God will prove kind to you and preserve
you from the manifold dangers you may have to encounter on the stormy
ocean Mrs Vickers also was pleased to say that I had behaved kindly
to her that she wished me well and that when she returned to
Hobart Town she would speak in my favour They then cheered us on our
departure wishing we might be prosperous on account of our humanity in
sharing the provisions with them

Having had breakfast we commenced throwing overboard the light cargo
which was in the hold which employed us until dinnertime After dinner
we ran out a small kedgeanchor with about one hundred fathoms of line
and having weighed anchor and the tide being slack we hauled on the
kedgeline and succeeded in this manner by kedging along and we
came to two islands called the Cap and Bonnet The whole of us then
commenced heaving the brig short sending the whaleboat to take her
in tow after we had tripped the anchor By this means we got her safe
across the Bar Scarcely was this done when a light breeze sprang up
from the southwest and firing a musket to apprize the party we had
left of our safety we made sail and put out to sea

Having read thus far Sylvia paused in an agony of recollection She
remembered the firing of the musket and that her mother had wept over
her But beyond this all was uncertainty Memories slipped across her
mind like shadowsshe caught at them and they were gone Yet the
reading of this strange story made her nerves thrill Despite the
hypocritical grandiloquence and affected piety of the narrative it
was easy to see that save some warping of facts to make for himself
a better case and to extol the courage of the gaolers who had him at
their mercy the narrator had not attempted to better his tale by the
invention of perils The history of the desperate project that had
been planned and carried out five years before was related with grim
simplicity which because it at once bears the stamp of truth and
forces the imagination of the reader to supply the omitted details
of horror is more effective to inspire sympathy than elaborate
description The very barrenness of the narration was hideously
suggestive and the girl felt her heart beat quicker as her poetic
intellect rushed to complete the terrible picture sketched by the
convict She saw it allthe blue sea the burning sun the slowly
moving ship the wretched company on the shore she heardWas that a
rustling in the bushes below her A bird How nervous she was growing

Being thus fairly ridas we thoughtof our prison life we cheerfully
held consultation as to our future course It was my intention to get
among the islands in the South Seas and scuttling the brig to pass
ourselves off among the natives as shipwrecked seamen trusting to Gods
mercy that some homeward bound vessel might at length rescue us With
this view I made James Lesly first mate he being an experienced
mariner and prepared myself with what few instruments we had to take
our departure from Birches Rock Having hauled the whaleboat alongside
we stove her together with the jollyboat and cast her adrift
This done I parted the landsmen with the seamen and steering east
southeast at eight pm we set our first watch In little more than an
hour after this came on a heavy gale from the southwest I and others
of the landsmen were violently seasick and Lesly had some difficulty
in handling the brig as the boisterous weather called for two men at
the helm In the morning getting upon deck with difficulty I found
that the wind had abated but upon sounding the well discovered much
water in the hold Lesly rigged the pumps but the starboard one only
could be made to work From that time there were but two businesses
aboardfrom the pump to the helm The gale lasted two days and a night
the brig running under closereefed topsails we being afraid to shorten
sail lest we might be overtaken by some pursuing vessel so strong was
the terror of our prison upon us

On the 16th at noon I again forced myself on deck and taking a
meridian observation altered the course of the brig to east and by
south wishing to run to the southward of New Zealand out of the usual
track of shipping and having a notion that should our provisions hold
out we might make the South American coast and fall into Christian
hands This done I was compelled to retire below and for a week lay
in my berth as one at the last gasp At times I repented my resolution
Fair urging me to bestir myself as the men were not satisfied with our
course On the 21st a mutiny occurred led by Lyons who asserted
we were heading into the Pacific and must infallibly perish This
disaffected man though ignorant of navigation insisted upon steering
to the south believing that we had run to the northward of the
Friendly Islands and was for running the ship ashore and beseeching
the protection of the natives Lesly in vain protested that a southward
course would bring us into icefields Barker who had served on board
a whaler strove to convince the mutineers that the temperature of such
latitudes was too warm for such an error to escape us After much noise
Lyons rushed to the helm and Russen drawing one of the pistols taken
from Mr Bates shot him dead upon which the others returned to their
duty This dreadful deed was I fear necessary to the safety of the
brig and had it occurred on board a vessel manned by freemen would
have been applauded as a stern but needful measure

Forced by these tumults upon deck I made a short speech to the crew
and convinced them that I was competent to perform what I had promised
to do though at the time my heart inwardly failed me and I longed for
some sign of land Supported at each arm by Lesly and Barker I took an
observation and altered our course to north by east the brig running
eleven knots an hour under singlereefed topsails and the pumps hard at
work So we ran until the 31st of January when a white squall took us
and nearly proved fatal to all aboard

Lesly now committed a great error for upon the brig righting she
was thrown upon her beam ends and her spanker boom carried away he
commanded to furl the foretop sail strike topgallant yards furl the
main course and take a reef in the maintopsail leaving her to scud
under singlereefed maintopsail and foresail This caused the vessel to
leak to that degree that I despaired of reaching land in her and prayed
to the Almighty to send us speedy assistance For nine days and nights
the storm continued the men being utterly exhausted One of the two
soldiers whom we had employed to fish the two pieces of the spanker
boom with some quartering that we had was washed overboard and
drowned Our provision was now nearly done but the gale abating on
the ninth day we hastened to put provisions on the launch The sea
was heavy and we were compelled to put a purchase on the fore and main
yards with preventers to windward to ease the launch in going over the
side We got her fairly afloat at last the others battening down the
hatches in the brig Having dressed ourselves in the clothes of Captain
Frere and the pilot we left the brig at sundown lying with her channel
plates nearly under water

The wind freshening during the night our launch which might indeed
be termed a longboat having been fitted with mast bowsprit and main
boom began to be very uneasy shipping two seas one after the other
The plan we could devise was to sit four of us about in the stern
sheets with our backs to the sea to prevent the water pooping us This
itself was enough to exhaust the strongest men The day however made
us some amends for the dreadful night Land was not more than ten miles
from us approaching as nearly as we could with safety we hauled our
wind and ran along in trusting to find some harbour At halfpast two
we sighted a bay of very curious appearance having two large rocks at
the entrance resembling pyramids Shiers Russen and Fair landed in
hopes of discovering fresh water of which we stood much in need Before
long they returned stating that they had found an Indian hut inside
of which were some rude earthenware vessels Fearful of surprise we lay
off the shore all that night and putting into the bay very early in the
morning killed a seal This was the first fresh meat I had tasted for
four years It seemed strange to eat it under such circumstances We
cooked the flippers heart and liver for breakfast giving some to
a cat which we had taken with us out of the brig for I would not
willingly allow even that animal to perish After breakfast we got
under weigh and we had scarcely been out half an hour when we had a
fresh breeze which carried us along at the rate of seven knots an hour
running from bay to bay to find inhabitants Steering along the shore
as the sun went down we suddenly heard the bellowing of a bullock and
James Barker whom from his violent conduct I thought incapable of
such sentiment burst into tears

In about two hours we perceived great fires on the beach and let go
anchor in nineteen fathoms of water We lay awake all that night In the
morning we rowed further inshore and moored the boat to some seaweed
As soon as the inhabitants caught sight of us they came down to the
beach I distributed needles and thread among the Indians and on my
saying Valdivia a woman instantly pointed towards a tongue of land to
the southward holding up three fingers and crying leaghos which I
conjectured to be three leagues the distance we afterwards found it to
be

About three oclock in the afternoon we weathered the point pointed
out by the woman and perceived a flagstaff and a twelvegun battery
under our lee I now divided among the men the sum of six pounds ten
shillings that I had found in Captain Freres cabin and made another
and more equal distribution of the clothing There were also two
watches one of which I gave to Lesly and kept the other for myself It
was resolved among us to say that we were part crew of the brig Julia
bound for China and wrecked in the South Seas Upon landing at the
battery we were heartily entertained though we did not understand one
word of what they said Next morning it was agreed that Lesly Barker
Shiers and Russen should pay for a canoe to convey them to the town
which was nine miles up the river and on the morning of the 6th March
they took their departure On the 9th March a boat commanded by a
lieutenant came down with orders that the rest of us should be conveyed
to town and we accordingly launched the boat under convoy of the
soldiers and reached the town the same evening in some trepidation I
feared lest the Spaniards had obtained a clue as to our real character
and was not deceivedthe surviving soldier having betrayed us This
fellow was thus doubly a traitorfirst in deserting his officer and
then in betraying his comrades

We were immediately escorted to prison where we found our four
companions Some of them were for brazening out the story of shipwreck
but knowing how confused must necessarily be our accounts were we
examined separately I persuaded them that open confession would be our
best chance of safety On the 14th we were taken before the Intendente
or Governor who informed us that we were free on condition that we
chose to live within the limits of the town At this intelligence I felt
my heart grow light and only begged in the name of my companions that
we might not be given up to the British Government rather than which
said I I would beg to be shot dead in the palace square The Governor
regarded us with tears in his eyes and spoke as follows My poor men
do not think that I would take that advantage over you Do not make an
attempt to escape and I will be your friend and should a vessel come
tomorrow to demand you you shall find I will be as good as my word All
I have to impress upon you is to beware of intemperance which is
very prevalent in this country and when you find it convenient to
pay Government the money that was allowed you for subsistence while in
prison

The following day we all procured employment in launching a vessel of
three hundred tons burden and my men showed themselves so active
that the owner said he would rather have us than thirty of his own
countrymen which saying pleased the Governor who was there with almost
the whole of the inhabitants and a whole band of music this vessel
having been nearly three years on the stocks After she was launched
the seamen amongst us helped to fit her out being paid fifteen dollars
a month with provisions on board As for myself I speedily obtained
employment in the shipbuilders yard and subsisted by honest industry
almost forgetting in the unwonted pleasures of freedom the sad reverse
of fortune which had befallen me To think that I who had mingled among
gentlemen and scholars should be thankful to labour in a shipwrights
yard by day and sleep on a bundle of hides by night But this is
personal matter and need not be obtruded

In the same yard with me worked the soldier who had betrayed us and I
could not but regard it as a special judgment of Heaven when he one
day fell from a great height and was taken up for dead dying in much
torment in a few hours The days thus passed on in comparative happiness
until the 20th of May 1836 when the old Governor took his departure
regretted by all the inhabitants of Valdivia and the Achilles a
oneandtwentygun brig of war arrived with the new Governor One of
the first acts of this gentleman was to sell our boat which was moored
at the back of Governmenthouse This proceeding looked to my mind
indicative of illwill and fearful lest the Governor should deliver us
again into bondage I resolved to make my escape from the place Having
communicated my plans to Barker Lesly Riley Shiers and Russen I
offered the Governor to get built for him a handsome whaleboat making
the iron work myself The Governor consented and in a little more
than a fortnight we had completed a fouroared whaleboat capable of
weathering either sea or storm We fitted her with sails and provisions
in the Governors name and on the 4th of July being a Saturday night
we took our departure from Valdivia dropping down the river shortly
after sunset Whether the Governor disgusted at the trick we had
played him decided not to pursue us or whetheras I rather thinkour
absence was not discovered until the Monday morning when we were beyond
reach of capture I know not but we got out to sea without hazard
and taking accurate bearings ran for the Friendly Islands as had been
agreed upon amongst us

But it now seemed that the good fortune which had hitherto attended
us had deserted us for after crawling for four days in sultry
weather there fell a dead calm and we lay like a log upon the sea for
fortyeight hours For three days we remained in the midst of the ocean
exposed to the burning rays of the sun in a boat without water or
provisions On the fourth day just as we had resolved to draw lots
to determine who should die for the sustenance of the others we were
picked up by an opium clipper returning to Canton The captain
an American was most kind to us and on our arrival at Canton a
subscription was got up for us by the British merchants of that city
and a free passage to England obtained for us Russen however getting
in drink made statements which brought suspicion upon us I had imposed
upon the Consul with a fictitious story of a wreck but had stated that
my name was Wilson forgetting that the sextant which had been
preserved in the boat had Captain Batess name engraved upon it These
circumstances together caused sufficient doubts in the Consuls mind to
cause him to give directions that on our arrival in London we were
to be brought before the Thames Police Court There being no evidence
against us we should have escaped had not a Dr Pine who had been
surgeon on board the Malabar transport being in the Court recognized
me and swore to my identity We were remanded and to complete the
chain of evidence Mr Capon the Hobart Town gaoler was strangely
enough in London at the time and identified us all Our story was
then made public and Barker and Lesly turning Queens evidence against
Russen he was convicted of the murder of Lyons and executed We
were then placed on board the Leviathan hulk and remained there until
shipped in the Lady Jane which was chartered with convicts for Van
Diemens Land in order to be tried in the colony where the offence was
committed for piratically seizing the brig Osprey and arrived here on
the 15th December 1838


     


Coming breathless to the conclusion of this wonderful relation Sylvia
suffered her hand to fall into her lap and sat meditative The history
of this desperate struggle for liberty was to her full of vague horror
She had never before realized among what manner of men she had lived
The sullen creatures who worked in the chaingangs or pulled in the
boatstheir faces brutalized into a uniform blanknessmust be very
different men from John Rex and his companions Her imagination pictured
the voyage in the leaky brig the South American slavery the midnight
escape the desperate rowing the long slow agony of starvation
and the heartsickness that must have followed upon recapture and
imprisonment Surely the punishment of penal servitude must have been
made very terrible for men to dare such hideous perils to escape
from it Surely John Rex the convict who alone and prostrated
by sickness quelled a mutiny and navigated a vessel through a
stormravaged ocean must possess qualities which could be put to better
use than stonequarrying Was the opinion of Maurice Frere the correct
one after all and were these convict monsters gifted with unnatural
powers of endurance only to be subdued and tamed by unnatural and
inhuman punishments of lash and chain Her fancies growing amid the fast
gathering gloom she shuddered as she guessed to what extremities of
evil might such men proceed did an opportunity ever come to them to
retaliate upon their gaolers Perhaps beneath each mask of servility and
sullen fear that was the ordinary prison face lay hid a courage and a
despair as mighty as that which sustained those ten poor wanderers over
the Pacific Ocean Maurice had told her that these people had their
secret signs their secret language She had just seen a specimen of
the skill with which this very Rexstill bent upon escapecould send
a hidden message to his friends beneath the eyes of his gaolers What
if the whole island was but one smouldering volcano of revolt and
murderthe whole convict population but one incarnated conspiracy
bound together by crime and suffering Terrible to think ofyet not
impossible

Oh how strangely must the world have been civilized that this most
lovely corner of it must needs be set apart as a place of banishment for
the monsters that civilization had brought forth and bred She cast her
eyes around and all beauty seemed blotted out from the scene before
her The graceful foliage melting into indistinctness in the gathering
twilight appeared to her horrible and treacherous The river seemed to
flow sluggishly as though thickened with blood and tears The shadow of
the trees seemed to hold lurking shapes of cruelty and danger Even the
whispering breeze bore with it sighs and threats and mutterings of
revenge Oppressed by a terror of loneliness she hastily caught up the
manuscript and turned to seek the house when as if summoned from the
earth by the power of her own fears a ragged figure barred her passage

To the excited girl this apparition seemed the embodiment of the unknown
evil she had dreaded She recognized the yellow clothing and marked the
eager hands outstretched to seize her Instantly upon her flashed the
story that three days since had set the prisontown agog The desperado
of Port Arthur the escaped mutineer and murderer was before her with
unchained arms free to wreak his will of her

Sylvia It is you Oh at last I have escaped and come to askWhat
Do you not know me

Pressing both hands to her bosom she stepped back a pace speechless
with terror

I am Rufus Dawes he said looking in her face for the grateful smile
of recognition that did not comeRufus Dawes

The party at the house had finished their wine and sitting on the
broad verandah were listening to some gentle dullness of the clergyman
when there broke upon their ears a cry

Whats that said Vickers

Frere sprang up and looked down the garden He saw two figures that
seemed to struggle together One glance was enough and with a shout
he leapt the flowerbeds and made straight at the escaped prisoner

Rufus Dawes saw him coming but secure in the protection of the girl
who owed to him so much he advanced a step nearer and loosing his
respectful clasp of her hand caught her dress

Oh help Maurice help cried Sylvia again

Into the face of Rufus Dawes came an expression of horrorstricken
bewilderment For three days the unhappy man had contrived to keep life
and freedom in order to get speech with the one being who he thought
cherished for him some affection Having made an unparalleled escape
from the midst of his warders he had crept to the place where lived the
idol of his dreams braving recapture that he might hear from her two
words of justice and gratitude Not only did she refuse to listen to
him and shrink from him as from one accursed but at the sound of
his name she summoned his deadliest foe to capture him Such monstrous
ingratitude was almost beyond belief She toothe child he had nursed
and fed the child for whom he had given up his hardearned chance of
freedom and fortune the child of whom he had dreamed the child whose
image he had worshippedshe too against him Then there was no
justice no Heaven no God He loosed his hold of her dress and
regardless of the approaching footsteps stood speechless shaking from
head to foot In another instant Frere and McNab flung themselves upon
him and he was borne to the ground Though weakened by starvation he
shook them off with scarce an effort and despite the servants who came
hurrying from the alarmed house might even then have turned and
made good his escape But he seemed unable to fly His chest heaved
convulsively great drops of sweat beaded his white face and from his
eyes tears seemed about to break For an instant his features worked
convulsively as if he would fain invoke upon the girl weeping on her
fathers shoulder some hideous curse But no words cameonly thrusting
his hand into his breast with a supreme gesture of horror and aversion
he flung something from him Then a profound sigh escaped him and he
held out his hands to be bound

There was something so pitiable about this silent grief that as they
led him away the little group instinctively averted their faces lest
they should seem to triumph over him




CHAPTER XI A RELIC OF MACQUARIE HARBOUR



You must try and save him from further punishment said Sylvia next
day to Frere I did not mean to betray the poor creature but I had
made myself nervous by reading that convicts story

You shouldnt read such rubbish said Frere Whats the use I dont
suppose a word of its true

It must be true I am sure its true Oh Maurice these are dreadful
men I thought I knew all about convicts but I had no idea that such
men as these were among them

Thank God you know very little said Maurice The servants you have
here are very different sort of fellows from Rex and Company

Oh Maurice I am so tired of this place Its wrong perhaps with
poor papa and all but I do wish I was somewhere out of the sight of
chains I dont know what has made me feel as I do

Come to Sydney said Frere There are not so many convicts there It
was arranged that we should go to Sydney you know

For our honeymoon Yes said Sylvia simply I know it was But we
are not married yet

Thats easily done said Maurice

Oh nonsense sir But I want to speak to you about this poor Dawes
I dont think he meant any harm It seems to me now that he was rather
going to ask for food or something only I was so nervous They wont
hang him Maurice will they

No said Maurice I spoke to your father this morning If the fellow
is tried for his life you may have to give evidence and so we came to
the conclusion that Port Arthur again and heavy irons will meet the
case We gave him another life sentence this morning That will make the
third he has had

What did he say

Nothing I sent him down aboard the schooner at once He ought to be
out of the river by this time Maurice I have a strange feeling about
that man

Eh said Maurice

I seem to fear him as if I knew some story about him and yet didnt
know it

Thats not very clear said Maurice forcing a laugh but dont
lets talk about him any more Well soon be far from Port Arthur and
everybody in it

Maurice said she caressingly I love you dear Youll always
protect me against these men wont you

Maurice kissed her You have not got over your fright Sylvia he
said I see I shall have to take a great deal of care of my wife

Of course replied Sylvia

And then the pair began to make love or rather Maurice made it and
Sylvia suffered him

Suddenly her eye caught something Whats thatthere on the ground by
the fountain They were near the spot where Dawes had been seized the
night before A little stream ran through the garden and a Tritonof
convict manufactureblew his horn in the middle of aconvict
builtrockery Under the lip of the fountain lay a small packet Frere
picked it up It was made of soiled yellow cloth and stitched evidently
by a mans fingers It looks like a needlecase said he

Let me see What a strangelooking thing Yellow cloth too Why
it must belong to a prisoner Oh Maurice the man who was here last
night

Ay says Maurice turning over the packet it might have been his
sure enough

He seemed to fling something from him I thought Perhaps this is
it said she peering over his arm in delicate curiosity Frere with
something of a scowl on his brow tore off the outer covering of the
mysterious packet and displayed a second envelope of grey cloththe
goodconduct uniform Beneath this was a piece some three inches
square of stained and discoloured merino that had once been blue

Hullo says Frere Why whats this

It is a piece of a dress says Sylvia

It was Rufus Dawess talismana portion of the frock she had worn at
Macquarie Harbour and which the unhappy convict had cherished as a
sacred relic for five weary years

Frere flung it into the water The running stream whirled it away Why
did you do that cried the girl with a sudden pang of remorse for
which she could not account The shred of cloth caught by a weed
lingered for an instant on the surface of the water Almost at the same
moment the pair raising their eyes saw the schooner which bore Rufus
Dawes back to bondage glide past the opening of the trees and disappear
When they looked again for the strange relic of the desperado of Port
Arthur it also had vanished




CHAPTER XII AT PORT ARTHUR



The usual clanking and hammering was prevalent upon the stone jetty of
Port Arthur when the schooner bearing the returned convict Rufus Dawes
ran alongside On the heights above the esplanade rose the grim front
of the soldiers barracks beneath the soldiers barracks was the long
range of prison buildings with their workshops and tanpits to the left
lay the Commandants house authoritative by reason of its embrasured
terrace and guardian sentry while the jetty that faced the purple
length of the Island of the Dead swarmed with particoloured figures
clanking about their enforced business under the muskets of their
gaolers

Rufus Dawes had seen this prospect before had learnt by heart each
beauty of rising sun sparkling water and wooded hill From the
hideously clean jetty at his feet to the distant signal station that
embowered in bloom reared its slender arms upwards into the cloudless
sky he knew it all There was no charm for him in the exquisite blue
of the sea the soft shadows of the hills or the soothing ripple of the
waves that crept voluptuously to the white breast of the shining shore
He sat with his head bowed down and his hands clasped about his knees
disdaining to look until they roused him

Hallo Dawes says Warder Troke halting his train of ironed
yellowjackets So youve come back again Glad to see yer Dawes It
seems an age since we had the pleasure of your company Dawes At this
pleasantry the train laughed so that their irons clanked more than
ever They found it often inconvenient not to laugh at Mr Trokes
humour Step down here Dawes and let me introduce you to your hold
friends Theyll be glad to see yer wont yer boys Why bless
me Dawes we thort wed lost yer We thort yerd given us the slip
altogether Dawes They didnt take care of yer in Hobart Town I
expect eh boys Well look after yer here Dawes though You wont
bolt any more

Take care Mr Troke said a warning voice youre at it again Let
the man alone

By virtue of an order transmitted from Hobart Town they had begun to
attach the dangerous prisoner to the last man of the gang riveting the
legirons of the pair by means of an extra link which could be removed
when necessary but Dawes had given no sign of consciousness At the
sound of the friendly tones however he looked up and saw a tall
gaunt man dressed in a shabby pepperandsalt raiment and wearing a
black handkerchief knotted round his throat He was a stranger to him

I beg yer pardon Mr North said Troke sinking at once the bully in
the sneak I didnt see yer reverence

A parson thought Dawes with disappointment and dropped his eyes

I know that returned Mr North coolly If you had you would have
been all butter and honey Dont trouble yourself to tell a lie its
quite unnecessary

Dawes looked up again This was a strange parson

Whats your name my man said Mr North suddenly catching his eye

Rufus Dawes had intended to scowl but the tone sharply authoritative
roused his automatic convict second nature and he answered almost
despite himself Rufus Dawes

Oh said Mr North eyeing him with a curious air of expectation that
had something pitying in it This is the man is it I thought he was
to go to the Coal Mines

So he is said Troke but we haint a goin to send there for a
fortnit and in the meantime Im to work him on the chain

Oh said Mr North again Lend me your knife Troke

And then before them all this curious parson took a piece of tobacco
out of his ragged pocket and cut off a chaw with Mr Trokes knife
Rufus Dawes felt what he had not felt for three daysan interest in
something He stared at the parson in unaffected astonishment Mr North
perhaps mistook the meaning of his fixed stare for he held out the
remnant of tobacco to him

The chain line vibrated at this and bent forward to enjoy the vicarious
delight of seeing another man chew tobacco Troke grinned with a silent
mirth that betokened retribution for the favoured convict Here said
Mr North holding out the dainty morsel upon which so many eyes were
fixed Rufus Dawes took the tobacco looked at it hungrily for an
instant and thento the astonishment of everybodyflung it away with
a curse

I dont want your tobacco he said keep it

From convict mouths went out a respectful roar of amazement and Mr
Trokes eyes snapped with pride of outraged janitorship You ungrateful
dog he cried raising his stick

Mr North put up a hand That will do Troke he said I know your
respect for the cloth Move the men on again

Get on said Troke rumbling oaths beneath his breath and Dawes felt
his newlyriveted chain tug It was some time since he had been in a
chaingang and the sudden jerk nearly overbalanced him He caught at
his neighbour and looking up met a pair of black eyes which gleamed
recognition His neighbour was John Rex Mr North watching them was
struck by the resemblance the two men bore to each other Their height
eyes hair and complexion were similar Despite the difference in
name they might be related They might be brothers thought he Poor
devils I never knew a prisoner refuse tobacco before And he looked on
the ground for the despised portion But in vain John Rex oppressed by
no foolish sentiment had picked it up and put it in his mouth

So Rufus Dawes was relegated to his old life again and came back to
his prison with the hatred of his kind that his prison had bred in him
increased a hundredfold It seemed to him that the sudden awakening
had dazed him that the flood of light so suddenly let in upon
his slumbering soul had blinded his eyes used so long to the
sweetlycheating twilight He was at first unable to apprehend the
details of his misery He knew only that his dreamchild was alive and
shuddered at him that the only thing he loved and trusted had betrayed
him that all hope of justice and mercy had gone from him for ever that
the beauty had gone from earth the brightness from Heaven and that he
was doomed still to live He went about his work unheedful of the jests
of Troke ungalled by his irons unmindful of the groans and laughter
about him His magnificent muscles saved him from the lash for the
amiable Troke tried to break him down in vain He did not complain he
did not laugh he did not weep His mate Rex tried to converse with
him but did not succeed In the midst of one of Rexs excellent
tales of London dissipation Rufus Dawes would sigh wearily Theres
something on that fellows mind thought Rex prone to watch the signs
by which the soul is read He has some secret which weighs upon him

It was in vain that Rex attempted to discover what this secret might be
To all questions concerning his past lifehowever artfully putRufus
Dawes was dumb In vain Rex practised all his arts called up all his
graces of manner and speechand these were not fewto fascinate the
silent man and win his confidence Rufus Dawes met his advances with
a cynical carelessness that revealed nothing and when not addressed
held a gloomy silence Galled by this indifference John Rex had
attempted to practise those ingenious arts of torment by which Gabbett
Vetch or other leading spirits of the gang asserted their superiority
over their quieter comrades But he soon ceased I have been longer in
this hell than you said Rufus Dawes and I know more of the devils
tricks than you can show me You had best be quiet Rex neglected the
warning and Rufus Dawes took him by the throat one day and would have
strangled him but that Troke beat off the angered man with a favourite
bludgeon Rex had a wholesome respect for personal prowess and had
the grace to admit the provocation to Troke Even this instance of
selfdenial did not move the stubborn Dawes He only laughed Then
Rex came to a conclusion His mate was plotting an escape He himself
cherished a notion of the kind as did Gabbett and Vetch but by common
distrust no one ever gave utterance to thoughts of this nature It would
be too dangerous He would be a good comrade for a rush thought Rex
and resolved more firmly than ever to ally himself to this dangerous and
silent companion

One question Dawes had asked which Rex had been able to answer Who is
that North

A chaplain He is only here for a week or so There is a new one
coming North goes to Sydney He is not in favour with the Bishop

How do you know

By deduction says Rex with a smile peculiar to him He wears
coloured clothes and smokes and doesnt patter Scripture The
Bishop dresses in black detests tobacco and quotes the Bible like a
concordance North is sent here for a month as a warmingpan for that
ass Meekin Ergo the Bishop dont care about North

Jemmy Vetch who was next to Rex let the full weight of his portion
of treetrunk rest upon Gabbett in order to express his unrestrained
admiration of Mr Rexs sarcasm Aint the Dandy a oneer said he

Are you thinking of coming the pious asked Rex Its no good with
North Wait until the highlyintelligent Meekin comes You can twist
that worthy successor of the Apostles round your little finger

Silence there cries the overseer Do you want me to report yer

Amid such diversions the days rolled on and Rufus Dawes almost longed
for the Coal Mines To be sent from the settlement to the Coal Mines
and from the Coal Mines to the settlement was to these unhappy men a
trip At Port Arthur one went to an outstation as more fortunate
people go to Queenscliff or the Ocean Beach nowadays for change of
air




CHAPTER XIII THE COMMANDANTS BUTLER



Rufus Dawes had been a fortnight at the settlement when a newcomer
appeared on the chaingang This was a young man of about twenty years
of age thin fair and delicate His name was Kirkland and he belonged
to what were known as the educated prisoners He had been a clerk in
a banking house and was transported for embezzlement though by some
grave doubts as to his guilt were entertained The Commandant Captain
Burgess had employed him as butler in his own house and his fate was
considered a lucky one So doubtless it was and might have been
had not an untoward accident occurred Captain Burgess who was a
bachelor of the old school confessed to an amiable weakness for
blasphemy and was given to condemning the convicts eyes and limbs with
indiscriminate violence Kirkland belonged to a Methodist family and
owned a piety utterly out of place in that region The language of
Burgess made him shudder and one day he so far forgot himself and his
place as to raise his hands to his ears My blank cried Burgess You
blank blank is that your blank game Ill blank soon cure you of that
and forthwith ordered him to the chaingang for insubordination

He was received with suspicion by the gang who did not like
whitehanded prisoners Troke by way of experiment in human nature
perhaps placed him next to Gabbett The day was got through in the
usual way and Kirkland felt his heart revive

The toil was severe and the companionship uncouth but despite his
blistered hands and aching back he had not experienced anything so very
terrible after all When the muster bell rang and the gang broke up
Rufus Dawes on his silent way to his separate cell observed a notable
change of custom in the disposition of the new convict Instead of
placing him in a cell by himself Troke was turning him into the yard
with the others

Im not to go in there says the exbank clerk drawing back in dismay
from the cloud of foul faces which lowered upon him

By the Lord but you are then says Troke The Governor says a night
in therell take the starch out of ye Come in yer go

But Mr Troke

Stow your gaff says Troke with another oath and impatiently
striking the lad with his thongI cant argue here all night Get in
So Kirkland aged twentytwo and the son of Methodist parents went in

Rufus Dawes among whose sinister memories this yard was numbered
sighed So fierce was the glamour of the place however that when
locked into his cell he felt ashamed for that sigh and strove to erase
the memory of it What is he more than anybody else said the wretched
man to himself as he hugged his misery close

About dawn the next morning Mr Northwho amongst other vagaries not
approved of by his bishop had a habit of prowling about the prison
at unofficial hourswas attracted by a dispute at the door of the
dormitory

Whats the matter here he asked

A prisoner refractory your reverence said the watchman Wants to
come out

Mr North Mr North cried a voice for the love of God let me out
of this place

Kirkland ghastly pale bleeding with his woollen shirt torn and his
blue eyes wide open with terror was clinging to the bars

Oh Mr North Mr North Oh Mr North Oh for Gods sake Mr
North

What Kirkland cried North who was ignorant of the vengeance of the
Commandant What do you do here

But Kirkland could do nothing but cryOh Mr North For Gods sake
Mr North and beat on the bars with white and sweating hands

Let him out watchman said North

Cant sir without an order from the Commandant

I order you sir North cried indignant

Very sorry your reverence but your reverence knows that I darent do
such a thing Mr North screamed Kirkland Would you see me
perish body and soul in this place Mr North Oh you ministers of
Christwolves in sheeps clothingyou shall be judged for this

Let him out cried North again stamping his foot

Its no good returned the gaoler I cant If he was dying I
cant

North rushed away to the Commandant and the instant his back was
turned Hailes the watchman flung open the door and darted into the
dormitory

Take that he cried dealing Kirkland a blow on the head with his
keys that stretched him senseless Theres more trouble with you
bloody aristocrats than enough Lie quiet

The Commandant roused from slumber told Mr North that Kirkland might
stop where he was and that hed thank the chaplain not to wake him
up in the middle of the night because a blank prisoner set up a blank
howling

But my good sir protested North restraining his impulse to overstep
the bounds of modesty in his language to his superior officer you know
the character of the men in that ward You can guess what that unhappy
boy has suffered

Impertinent young beggar said Burgess Do him good curse him Mr
North Im sorry you should have had the trouble to come here but will
you let me go to sleep

North returned to the prison disconsolately found the dutiful Hailes at
his post and all quiet

Whats become of Kirkland he asked

Fretted hisself to sleep yer reverence said Hailes in accents of
parental concern Poor young chap Its hard for such young uns

In the morning Rufus Dawes coming to his place on the chaingang was
struck by the altered appearance of Kirkland His face was of a greenish
tint and wore an expression of bewildered horror

Cheer up man said Dawes touched with momentary pity Its no good
being in the mopes you know

What do they do if you try to bolt whispered Kirkland

Kill you returned Dawes in a tone of surprise at so preposterous a
question

Thank God said Kirkland

Now then Miss Nancy said one of the men whats the matter with
you Kirkland shuddered and his pale face grew crimson

Oh he said that such a wretch as I should live

Silence cried Troke No 44 if you cant hold your tongue Ill give
you something to talk about March

The work of the gang that afternoon was the carrying of some heavy logs
to the waterside and Rufus Dawes observed that Kirkland was exhausted
long before the task was accomplished Theyll kill you you little
beggar said he not unkindly What have you been doing to get into
this scrape

Have you ever been in thatthat place I was in last night asked
Kirkland

Rufus Dawes nodded

Does the Commandant know what goes on there

I suppose so What does he care

Care Man do you believe in a God No said Dawes not here Hold
up my lad If you fall we must fall over you and then youre done
for

He had hardly uttered the words when the boy flung himself beneath the
log In another instant the train would have been scrambling over his
crushed body had not Gabbett stretched out an iron hand and plucked
the wouldbe suicide from death

Hold on to me Miss Nancy said the giant Im big enough to carry
double

Something in the tone or manner of the speaker affected Kirkland to
disgust for spurning the offered hand he uttered a cry and then
holding up his irons with his hands he started to run for the water

Halt you young fool roared Troke raising his carbine But Kirkland
kept steadily on for the river Just as he reached it however the
figure of Mr North rose from behind a pile of stones Kirkland jumped
for the jetty missed his footing and fell into the arms of the
chaplain

You young verminyou shall pay for this cries Troke Youll see if
you wont remember this day

Oh Mr North says Kirkland why did you stop me Id better be dead
than stay another night in that place

Youll get it my lad said Gabbett when the runaway was brought
back Your blessed hidell feel for this see if it dont

Kirkland only breathed harder and looked round for Mr North but Mr
North had gone The new chaplain was to arrive that afternoon and it
was incumbent on him to be at the reception Troke reported the exbank
clerk that night to Burgess and Burgess who was about to go to dinner
with the new chaplain disposed of his case out of hand Tried to bolt
eh Must stop that Fifty lashes Troke Tell Macklewain to be readyor
stay Ill tell him myselfIll break the young devils spirit blank
him

Yes sir said Troke Good evening sir

Trokepick out some likely man will you That last fellow you had
ought to have been tied up himself His flogging wouldnt have killed a
flea

You cant get em to warm one another your honour says Troke

They wont do it

Oh yes they will though says Burgess or Ill know the reason
why I wont have my men knocked up with flogging these rascals If the
scourger wont do his duty tie him up and give him fiveandtwenty for
himself Ill be down in the morning myself if I can

Very good your honour says Troke

Kirkland was put into a separate cell that night and Troke by way of
assuring him a good nights rest told him that he was to have fifty
in the morning And Dawesll lay it on he added Hes one of the
smartest men Ive got and he wont spare yer yer may take your oath of
that




CHAPTER XIV Mr NORTHS DISPOSITION



You will find this a terrible place Mr Meekin said North to his
supplanter as they walked across to the Commandants to dinner It has
made me heartsick

I thought it was a little paradise said Meekin Captain Frere says
that the scenery is delightful So it is returned North looking
askance but the prisoners are not delightful

Poor abandoned wretches says Meekin I suppose not How sweet the
moonlight sleeps upon that bank Eh

Abandoned indeed by God and manalmost

Mr North Providence never abandons the most unworthy of His servants
Never have I seen the righteous forsaken nor His seed begging their
bread In the valley of the shadow of death He is with us His staff
you know Mr North Really the Commandants house is charmingly
situated

Mr North sighed again You have not been long in the colony Mr
Meekin I doubtforgive me for expressing myself so freelyif you
quite know of our convict system

An admirable one A most admirable one said Meekin There were a
few matters I noticed in Hobart Town that did not quite please methe
frequent use of profane language for instancebut on the whole I was
delighted with the scheme It is so complete

North pursed up his lips Yes it is very complete he said almost
too complete But I am always in a minority when I discuss the question
so we will drop it if you please

If you please said Meekin gravely He had heard from the Bishop that
Mr North was an illconditioned sort of person who smoked clay pipes
had been detected in drinking beer out of a pewter pot and had been
heard to state that white neckcloths were of no consequence The
dinner went off successfully Burgessdesirous perhaps of favourably
impressing the chaplain whom the Bishop delighted to honourshut off
his blasphemy for a while and was urbane enough Youll find us rough
Mr Meekin he said but youll find us all there when were wanted
This is a little kingdom in itself

Like Berangers asked Meekin with a smile Captain Burgess had never
heard of Beranger but he smiled as if he had learnt his words by heart

Or like Sancho Panzas island said North You remember how justice
was administered there

Not at this moment sir said Burgess with dignity He had been often
oppressed by the notion that the Reverend Mr North chaffed him Pray
help yourself to wine

Thank you none said North filling a tumbler with water I have a
headache His manner of speech and action was so awkward that a silence
fell upon the party caused by each one wondering why Mr North should
grow confused and drum his fingers on the table and stare everywhere
but at the decanter Meekinever softly at his easewas the first to
speak Have you many visitors Captain Burgess

Very few Sometimes a party comes over with a recommendation from the
Governor and I show them over the place but as a rule we see no one
but ourselves

I asked said Meekin because some friends of mine were thinking of
coming

And who may they be

Do you know Captain Frere

Frere I should say so returned Burgess with a laugh modelled upon
Maurice Freres own I was quartered with him at Sarah Island So hes
a friend of yours eh

I had the pleasure of meeting him in society He is just married you
know

Is he said Burgess The devil he is I heard something about it
too

Miss Vickers a charming young person They are going to Sydney where
Captain Frere has some interest and Frere thinks of taking Port Arthur
on his way down

A strange fancy for a honeymoon trip said North

Captain Frere takes a deep interest in all relating to convict
discipline went on Meekin unheeding the interruption and is anxious
that Mrs Frere should see this place

Yes one oughtnt to leave the colony without seeing it says Burgess
its worth seeing

So Captain Frere thinks A romantic story Captain Burgess He saved
her life you know

Ah that was a queer thing that mutiny said Burgess Weve got the
fellows here you know

I saw them tried at Hobart Town said Meekin In fact the
ringleader John Rex gave me his confession and I sent it to the
Bishop

A great rascal put in North A dangerous scheming coldblooded
villain

Well now said Meekin with asperity I dont agree with you
Everybody seems to be against that poor fellowCaptain Frere tried to
make me think that his letters contained a hidden meaning but I
dont believe they did He seems to me to be truly penitent for his
offencesa misguided but not a hypocritical man if my knowledge of
human nature goes for anything

I hope he is said North I wouldnt trust him

Oh theres no fear of him said Burgess cheerily if he grows
uproarious well soon give him a touch of the cat

I suppose severity is necessary returned Meekin though to my ears a
flogging sounds a little distasteful It is a brutal punishment

Its a punishment for brutes said Burgess and laughed pleased with
the nearest approach to an epigram he ever made in his life

Here attention was called by the strange behaviour of Mr North He had
risen and without apology flung wide the window as though he gasped
for air Hullo North whats the matter

Nothing said North recovering himself with an effort A spasm I
have these attacks at times Have some brandy said Burgess

No no it will pass No I say Well if you insist And seizing the
tumbler offered to him he halffilled it with raw spirit and swallowed
the fiery draught at a gulp

The Reverend Meekin eyed his clerical brother with horror The Reverend
Meekin was not accustomed to clergymen who wore black neckties smoked
clay pipes chewed tobacco and drank neat brandy out of tumblers

Ha said North looking wildly round upon them Thats better

Let us go on to the verandah said Burgess Its cooler than in the
house

So they went on to the verandah and looked down upon the lights of
the prison and listened to the sea lapping the shore The Reverend
Mr North in this cool atmosphere seemed to recover himself and
conversation progressed with some sprightliness

By and by a short figure smoking a cheroot came up out of the dark
and proved to be Dr Macklewain who had been prevented from attending
the dinner by reason of an accident to a constable at Norfolk Bay which
had claimed his professional attention

Well hows Forrest cried Burgess Mr MeekinDr Macklewain

Dead said Dr Macklewain Delighted to see you Mr Meekin

Confound itanother of my best men grumbled Burgess Macklewain
have a glass of wine But Macklewain was tired and wanted to get home

I must also be thinking of repose said Meekin the journeythough
most enjoyablehas fatigued me

Come on then said North Our roads lie together doctor

You wont have a nip of brandy before you start asked Burgess

No Then I shall send round for you in the morning Mr Meekin Good
night Macklewain I want to speak with you a moment

Before the two clergymen had got halfway down the steep path that led
from the Commandants house to the flat on which the cottages of the
doctor and chaplain were built Macklewain rejoined them Another
flogging tomorrow said he grumblingly Up at daylight I suppose
again

Whom is he going to flog now

That young butlerfellow of his What Kirkland cried North You
dont mean to say hes going to flog Kirkland

Insubordination says Macklewain Fifty lashes

Oh this must be stopped cried North in great alarm He cant stand
it I tell you hell die Macklewain

Perhaps youll have the goodness to allow me to be the best judge of
that returned Macklewain drawing up his little body to its least
insignificant stature

My dear sir replied North alive to the importance of conciliating
the surgeon you havent seen him lately He tried to drown himself
this morning

Mr Meekin expressed some alarm but Dr Macklewain reassured him
That sort of nonsense must be stopped said he A nice example to
set I wonder Burgess didnt give him a hundred

He was put into the long dormitory said North you know what sort of
a place that is I declare to Heaven his agony and shame terrified me

Well hell be put into the hospital for a week or so tomorrow said
Macklewain and thatll give him a spell

If Burgess flogs him Ill report it to the Governor cries North in
great heat The condition of those dormitories is infamous

If the boy has anything to complain of why dont he complain We cant
do anything without evidence

Complain Would his life be safe if he did Besides hes not the sort
of creature to complain Hed rather kill himself

Thats all nonsense says Macklewain We cant flog a whole dormitory
on suspicion I cant help it The boys made his bed and he must lie
on it

Ill go back and see Burgess said North Mr Meekin heres the
gate and your room is on the right hand Ill be back shortly

Pray dont hurry said Meekin politely You are on an errand of
mercy you know Everything must give way to that I shall find my
portmanteau in my room you said

Yes yes Call the servant if you want anything He sleeps at the
back and North hurried off

An impulsive gentleman said Meekin to Macklewain as the sound of Mr
Norths footsteps died away in the distance Macklewain shook his head
seriously

There is something wrong about him but I cant make out what it is He
has the strangest fits at times Unless its a cancer in the stomach I
dont know what it can be

Cancer in the stomach dear me how dreadful says Meekin Ah
Doctor we all have our crosses have we not How delightful the grass
smells This seems a very pleasant place and I think I shall enjoy
myself very much Goodnight

Goodnight sir I hope you will be comfortable

And let us hope poor Mr North will succeed in his labour of love
said Meekin shutting the little gate and save the unfortunate
Kirkland Goodnight once more

Captain Burgess was shutting his verandahwindow when North hurried up

Captain Burgess Macklewain tells me you are going to flog Kirkland

Well sir what of that said Burgess

I have come to beg you not to do so sir The lad has been cruelly
punished already He attempted suicide todayunhappy creature

Well thats just what Im flogging him for Ill teach my prisoners to
attempt suicide

But he cant stand it sir Hes too weak

Thats Macklewains business

Captain Burgess protested North I assure you that he does not
deserve punishment I have seen him and his condition of mind is
pitiable

Look here Mr North I dont interfere with what you do to the
prisoners souls dont you interfere with what I do to their bodies

Captain Burgess you have no right to mock at my office

Then dont you interfere with me sir

Do you persist in having this boy flogged

Ive given my orders sir

Then Captain Burgess cried North his pale face flushing I tell
you the boys blood will be on your head I am a minister of God sir
and I forbid you to commit this crime

Damn your impertinence sir burst out Burgess Youre a dismissed
officer of the Government sir Youve no authority here in any way
and by God sir if you interfere with my discipline sir Ill have
you put in irons until youre shipped out of the island

This of course was mere bravado on the part of the Commandant North
knew well that he would never dare to attempt any such act of violence
but the insult stung him like the cut of a whip He made a stride
towards the Commandant as though to seize him by the throat but
checking himself in time stood still with clenched hands flashing
eyes and beard that bristled

The two men looked at each other and presently Burgesss eyes fell
before those of the chaplain

Miserable blasphemer says North I tell you that you shall not flog
the boy

Burgess white with rage rang the bell that summoned his convict
servant

Show Mr North out he said and go down to the Barracks and tell
Troke that Kirkland is to have a hundred lashes tomorrow Ill show you
whos master here my good sir

Ill report this to the Government said North aghast This is
murderous

The Government may go to and you too roared Burgess Get out
And Gods viceregent at Port Arthur slammed the door

North returned home in great agitation They shall not flog that boy
he said Ill shield him with my own body if necessary Ill report
this to the Government Ill see Sir John Franklin myself Ill have the
light of day let into this den of horrors He reached his cottage and
lighted the lamp in the little sittingroom All was silent save that
from the adjoining chamber came the sound of Meekins gentlemanly snore
North took down a book from the shelf and tried to read but the letters
ran together I wish I hadnt taken that brandy he said Fool that I
am

Then he began to walk up and down to fling himself on the sofa to
read to pray Oh God give me strength Aid me Help me I struggle
but I am weak O Lord look down upon me

To see him rolling on the sofa in agony to see his white face his
parched lips and his contracted brow to hear his moans and muttered
prayers one would have thought him suffering from the pangs of some
terrible disease He opened the book again and forced himself to read
but his eyes wandered to the cupboard There lurked something that
fascinated him He got up at length went into the kitchen and found
a packet of red pepper He mixed a teaspoonful of this in a pannikin of
water and drank it It relieved him for a while

I must keep my wits for tomorrow The life of that lad depends upon
it Meekin too will suspect I will lie down

He went into his bedroom and flung himself on the bed but only to toss
from side to side In vain he repeated texts of Scripture and scraps
of verse in vain counted imaginary sheep or listened to imaginary
clocktickings Sleep would not come to him It was as though he had
reached the crisis of a disease which had been for days gathering force
I must have a teaspoonful he said to allay the craving

Twice he paused on the way to the sittingroom and twice was he driven
on by a power stronger than his will He reached it at length and
opening the cupboard pulled out what he sought A bottle of brandy
With this in his hand all moderation vanished He raised it to his
lips and eagerly drank Then ashamed of what he had done he thrust the
bottle back and made for his room Still he could not sleep The taste
of the liquor maddened him for more He saw in the darkness the brandy
bottlevulgar and terrible apparition He saw its amber fluid sparkle
He heard it gurgle as he poured it out He smelt the nutty aroma of
the spirit He pictured it standing in the corner of the cupboard and
imagined himself seizing it and quenching the fire that burned within
him He wept he prayed he fought with his desire as with a madness He
told himself that anothers life depended on his exertions that to give
way to his fatal passion was unworthy of an educated man and a reasoning
being that it was degrading disgusting and bestial That at all
times debasing at this particular time it was infamous that a vice
unworthy of any man was doubly sinful in a man of education and a
minister of God In vain In the midst of his arguments he found himself
at the cupboard with the bottle at his lips in an attitude that was at
once ludicrous and horrible

He had no cancer His disease was a more terrible one The Reverend
James Northgentleman scholar and Christian priestwas what the
world calls a confirmed drunkard




CHAPTER XV ONE HUNDRED LASHES



The morning sun bright and fierce looked down upon a curious sight In
a stoneyard was a little group of personsTroke Burgess Macklewain
Kirkland and Rufus Dawes

Three wooden staves seven feet high were fastened together in the form
of a triangle The structure looked not unlike that made by gypsies to
boil their kettles To this structure Kirkland was bound His feet were
fastened with thongs to the base of the triangle his wrists bound
above his head at the apex His body was then extended to its fullest
length and his white back shone in the sunlight During his tying up he
had said nothingonly when Troke pulled off his shirt he shivered

Now prisoner said Troke to Dawes do your duty

Rufus Dawes looked from the three stern faces to Kirklands white back
and his face grew purple In all his experience he had never been asked
to flog before He had been flogged often enough

You dont want me to flog him sir he said to the Commandant

Pick up the cat sir said Burgess astonished what is the meaning
of this Rufus Dawes picked up the heavy cat and drew its knotted
lashes between his fingers

Go on Dawes whispered Kirkland without turning his head You are
no more than another man

What does he say asked Burgess

Telling him to cut light sir said Troke eagerly lying they all
do it Cut light eh Well see about that Get on my man and look
sharp or Ill tie you up and give you fifty for yourself as sure as
God made little apples

Go on Dawes whispered Kirkland again I dont mind

Rufus Dawes lifted the cat swung it round his head and brought its
knotted cords down upon the white back

Wonn cried Troke

The white back was instantly striped with six crimson bars Kirkland
stifled a cry It seemed to him that he had been cut in half

Now then you scoundrel roared Burgess separate your cats What do
you mean by flogging a man that fashion

Rufus Dawes drew his crooked fingers through the entangled cords and
struck again This time the blow was more effective and the blood
beaded on the skin

The boy did not cry but Macklewain saw his hands clutch the staves
tightly and the muscles of his naked arms quiver

Tew

Thats better said Burgess

The third blow sounded as though it had been struck upon a piece of raw
beef and the crimson turned purple

My God said Kirkland faintly and bit his lips

The flogging proceeded in silence for ten strikes and then Kirkland
gave a screech like a wounded horse

OhCaptain BurgessDawesMr TrokeOh my God Oh
ohMercyOh DoctorMr NorthOh Oh Oh

Ten cried Troke impassively counting to the end of the first twenty

The lads back swollen into a lump now presented the appearance of a
ripe peach which a wilful child had scored with a pin Dawes turning
away from his bloody handiwork drew the cats through his fingers twice
They were beginning to get clogged a little

Go on said Burgess with a nod and Troke cried Wonn again

Roused by the morning sun streaming in upon him Mr North opened
his bloodshot eyes rubbed his forehead with hands that trembled and
suddenly awakening to a consciousness of his promised errand rolled
off the bed and rose to his feet He saw the empty brandy bottle on
his wooden dressingtable and remembered what had passed With shaking
hands he dashed water over his aching head and smoothed his garments
The debauch of the previous night had left the usual effects behind it
His brain seemed on fire his hands were hot and dry his tongue clove
to the roof of his mouth He shuddered as he viewed his pale face and
red eyes in the little lookingglass and hastily tried the door He had
retained sufficient sense in his madness to lock it and his condition
had been unobserved Stealing into the sittingroom he saw that the
clock pointed to halfpast six The flogging was to have taken place
at halfpast five Unless accident had favoured him he was already too
late Fevered with remorse and anxiety he hurried past the room where
Meekin yet slumbered and made his way to the prison As he entered the
yard Troke called Ten Kirkland had just got his fiftieth lash

Stop cried North Captain Burgess I call upon you to stop

Youre rather late Mr North retorted Burgess The punishment is
nearly over Wonn cried Troke again and North stood by biting his
nails and grinding his teeth during six more lashes

Kirkland ceased to yell now and merely moaned His back was like a
bloody sponge while in the interval between lashes the swollen flesh
twitched like that of a newkilled bullock Suddenly Macklewain saw his
head droop on his shoulder Throw him off Throw him off he cried
and Troke hurried to loosen the thongs

Fling some water over him said Burgess hes shamming

A bucket of water made Kirkland open his eyes I thought so said
Burgess Tie him up again

No Not if you are Christians cried North

He met with an ally where he least expected one Rufus Dawes flung down
the dripping cat Ill flog no more said he

What roared Burgess furious at this gross insolence

Ill flog no more Get someone else to do your blood work for you I
wont

Tie him up cried Burgess foaming Tie him up Here constable
fetch a man here with a fresh cat Ill give you that beggars fifty
and fifty more on the top of em and he shall look on while his back
cools

Rufus Dawes with a glance at North pulled off his shirt without a
word and stretched himself at the triangles His back was not white
and smooth like Kirklands had been but hard and seamed He had been
flogged before Troke appeared with Gabbettgrinning Gabbett liked
flogging It was his boast that he could flog a man to death on a place
no bigger than the palm of his hand He could use his left hand equally
with his right and if he got hold of a favourite would cross the
cuts

Rufus Dawes planted his feet firmly on the ground took fierce grasp on
the staves and drew in his breath Macklewain spread the garments of
the two men upon the ground and placing Kirkland upon them turned to
watch this new phase in the mornings amusement He grumbled a little
below his breath for he wanted his breakfast and when the Commandant
once began to flog there was no telling where he would stop Rufus Dawes
took fiveandtwenty lashes without a murmur and then Gabbett crossed
the cuts This went on up to fifty lashes and North felt himself
stricken with admiration at the courage of the man If it had not been
for that cursed brandy thought he with bitterness of selfreproach
I might have saved all this At the hundredth lash the giant paused
expecting the order to throw off but Burgess was determined to break
the mans spirit

Ill make you speak you dog if I cut your heart out he cried Go
on prisoner

For twenty lashes more Dawes was mute and then the agony forced from
his labouring breast a hideous cry But it was not a cry for mercy as
that of Kirklands had been Having found his tongue the wretched man
gave vent to his boiling passion in a torrent of curses He shrieked
imprecation upon Burgess Troke and North He cursed all soldiers
for tyrants all parsons for hypocrites He blasphemed his God and his
Saviour With a frightful outpouring of obscenity and blasphemy he
called on the earth to gape and swallow his persecutors for Heaven to
open and rain fire upon them for hell to yawn and engulf them quick
It was as though each blow of the cat forced out of him a fresh burst of
beastlike rage He seemed to have abandoned his humanity He foamed
he raved he tugged at his bonds until the strong staves shook again he
writhed himself round upon the triangles and spat impotently at Burgess
who jeered at his torments North with his hands to his ears crouched
against the corner of the wall palsied with horror It seemed to him
that the passions of hell raged around him He would fain have fled but
a horrible fascination held him back

In the midst of thiswhen the cat was hissing its loudestBurgess
laughing his hardest and the wretch on the triangles filling the air
with his cries North saw Kirkland look at him with what he thought a
smile Was it a smile He leapt forward and uttered a cry of dismay so
loud that all turned

Hullo says Troke running to the heap of clothes the young uns
slipped his wind

Kirkland was dead

Throw him off says Burgess aghast at the unfortunate accident
and Gabbett reluctantly untied the thongs that bound Rufus Dawes
Two constables were alongside him in an instant for sometimes newly
tortured men grew desperate This one however was silent with the
last lash only in taking his shirt from under the body of the boy he
muttered Dead and in his tone there seemed to be a touch of
envy Then flinging his shirt over his bleeding shoulders he walked
outdefiant to the last

Game aint he said one constable to the other as they pushed him
not ungently into an empty cell there to wait for the hospital guard
The body of Kirkland was taken away in silence and Burgess turned
rather pale when he saw Norths threatening face

It isnt my fault Mr North he said I didnt know that the lad was
chickenhearted But North turned away in disgust and Macklewain and
Burgess pursued their homeward route together

Strange that he should drop like that said the Commandant

Yes unless he had any internal disease said the surgeon

Disease of the heart for instance said Burgess

Ill postmortem him and see

Come in and have a nip Macklewain I feel quite qualmish said
Burgess And the two went into the house amid respectful salutes from
either side Mr North in agony of mind at what he considered the
consequence of his neglect slowly and with head bowed down as one
bent on a painful errand went to see the prisoner who had survived He
found him kneeling on the ground prostrated Rufus Dawes

At the low tone Rufus Dawes looked up and seeing who it was waved him
off

Dont speak to me he said with an imprecation that made Norths
flesh creep Ive told you what I think of youa hypocrite who stands
by while a man is cut to pieces and then comes and whines religion to
him

North stood in the centre of the cell with his arms hanging down and
his head bent

You are right he said in a low tone I must seem to you a
hypocrite I a servant of Christ A besotted beast rather I am not come
to whine religion to you I am come toto ask your pardon I might have
saved you from punishmentsaved that poor boy from death I wanted to
save him God knows But I have a vice I am a drunkard I yielded to
my temptation andI was too late I come to you as one sinful man to
another to ask you to forgive me And North suddenly flung himself
down beside the convict and catching his bloodbespotted hands in his
own cried Forgive me brother

Rufus Dawes too much astonished to speak bent his black eyes upon the
man who crouched at his feet and a ray of divine pity penetrated his
gloomy soul He seemed to catch a glimpse of misery more profound than
his own and his stubborn heart felt human sympathy with this erring
brother Then in this hell there is yet a man said he and a
handgrasp passed between these two unhappy beings North arose and
with averted face passed quickly from the cell Rufus Dawes looked at
his hand which his strange visitor had taken and something glittered
there It was a tear He broke down at the sight of it and when the
guard came to fetch the tameless convict they found him on his knees in
a corner sobbing like a child




CHAPTER XVI KICKING AGAINST THE PRICKS



The morning after this the Rev Mr North departed in the schooner
for Hobart Town Between the officious chaplain and the Commandant the
events of the previous day had fixed a great gulf Burgess knew that
North meant to report the death of Kirkland and guessed that he would
not be backward in relating the story to such persons in Hobart Town
as would most readily repeat it Blank awkward the fellows dying
he confessed to himself If he hadnt died nobody would have bothered
about him A sinister truth North on the other hand comforted
himself with the belief that the fact of the convicts death under the
lash would cause indignation and subsequent inquiry The truth must
come out if they only ask thought he Selfdeceiving North Four
years a Government chaplain and not yet attained to a knowledge of a
Governments method of asking about such matters Kirklands mangled
flesh would have fed the worms before the ink on the last minute from
deliberating Authority was dry

Burgess however touched with selfish regrets determined to baulk the
parson at the outset He would send down an official return of the
unfortunate occurrence by the same vessel that carried his enemy and
thus get the ear of the Office Meekin walking on the evening of the
flogging past the wooden shed where the body lay saw Troke bearing
buckets filled with darkcoloured water and heard a great splashing and
sluicing going on inside the hut What is the matter he asked

Doctors bin postmorticing the prisoner what was flogged this morning
sir said Troke and were cleanin up

Meekin sickened and walked on He had heard that unhappy Kirkland
possessed unknown disease of the heart and had unhappily died before
receiving his allotted punishment His duty was to comfort Kirklands
soul he had nothing to do with Kirklands slovenly unhandsome body
and so he went for a walk on the pier that the breeze might blow his
momentary sickness away from him On the pier he saw North talking to
Father Flaherty the Roman Catholic chaplain Meekin had been taught to
look upon a priest as a shepherd might look upon a wolf and passed with
a distant bow The pair were apparently talking on the occurrence of
the morning for he heard Father Flaherty say with a shrug of his round
shoulders He woas not one of moi people Mr North and the Govermint
would not suffer me to interfere with matters relating to Prhotestint
prisoners The wretched creature was a Protestant thought Meekin
At least then his immortal soul was not endangered by belief in the
damnable heresies of the Church of Rome So he passed on giving
goodhumoured Denis Flaherty the son of the buttermerchant of Kildrum
a wide berth and searoom lest he should pounce down upon him unawares
and with Jesuitical argument and silken softness of speech convert
him by force to his own state of erroras was the wellknown custom of
those intellectual gladiators the Priests of the Catholic Faith North
on his side left Flaherty with regret He had spent many a pleasant
hour with him and knew him for a narrowminded conscientious yet
laughterloving creature whose God was neither his belly nor his
breviary but sometimes in one place and sometimes in the other
according to the hour of the day and the fasts appointed for due
mortification of the flesh A man who would do Christian work in a
jogtrot parish or where men lived too easily to sin harshly but
utterly unfit to cope with Satan as the British Government had
transported him was Norths sadly satirical reflection upon Father
Flaherty as Port Arthur faded into indistinct beauty behind the
swiftsailing schooner God help those poor villains for neither
parson nor priest can

He was right North the drunkard and selftormented had a power for
good of which Meekin and the other knew nothing Not merely were the
men incompetent and selfindulgent but they understood nothing of
that frightful capacity for agony which is deep in the soul of
every evildoer They might strike the rock as they chose with
sharpestpointed machinemade pick of warranted Gospel manufacture
stamped with the approval of eminent divines of all ages but the water
of repentance and remorse would not gush for them They possessed not
the frail rod which alone was powerful to charm They had no sympathy
no knowledge no experience He who would touch the hearts of men must
have had his own heart seared The missionaries of mankind have ever
been great sinners before they earned the divine right to heal and
bless Their weakness was made their strength and out of their own
agony of repentance came the knowledge which made them masters and
saviours of their kind It was the agony of the Garden and the Cross
that gave to the worlds Preacher His kingdom in the hearts of men The
crown of divinity is a crown of thorns

North on his arrival went straight to the house of Major Vickers I
have a complaint to make sir he said I wish to lodge it formally
with you A prisoner has been flogged to death at Port Arthur I saw it
done

Vickers bent his brow A serious accusation Mr North I must of
course receive it with respect coming from you but I trust that you
have fully considered the circumstances of the case I always understood
Captain Burgess was a most humane man

North shook his head He would not accuse Burgess He would let the
events speak for themselves I only ask for an inquiry said he

Yes my dear sir I know Very proper indeed on your part if you think
any injustice has been done but have you considered the expense the
delay the immense trouble and dissatisfaction all this will give

No trouble no expense no dissatisfaction should stand in the way of
humanity and justice cried North

Of course not But will justice be done Are you sure you can prove
your case Mind I admit nothing against Captain Burgess whom I have
always considered a most worthy and zealous officer but supposing your
charge to be true can you prove it

Yes If the witnesses speak the truth

Who are they Myself Dr Macklewain the constable and two
prisoners one of whom was flogged himself He will speak the truth I
believe The other man I have not much faith in

Very well then there is only a prisoner and Dr Macklewain for if
there has been foul play the convictconstable will not accuse the
authorities Moreover the doctor does not agree with you

No cried North amazed

No You see then my dear sir how necessary it is not to be hasty in
matters of this kind I really thinkpardon me for my plainnessthat
your goodness of heart has misled you Captain Burgess sends a report
of the case He says the man was sentenced to a hundred lashes for gross
insolence and disobedience of orders that the doctor was present during
the punishment and that the man was thrown off by his directions after
he had received fiftysix lashes That after a short interval he was
found to be dead and that the doctor made a postmortem examination and
found disease of the heart

North started A postmortem I never knew there had been one held

Here is the medical certificate said Vickers holding it out
accompanied by the copies of the evidence of the constable and a letter
from the Commandant

Poor North took the papers and read them slowly They were apparently
straightforward enough Aneurism of the ascending aorta was given as the
cause of death and the doctor frankly admitted that had he known the
deceased to be suffering from that complaint he would not have permitted
him to receive more than twentyfive lashes I think Macklewain is
an honest man said North doubtfully He would not dare to return
a false certificate Yet the circumstances of the casethe horrible
condition of the prisonersthe frightful story of that boy

I cannot enter into these questions Mr North My position here is to
administer the law to the best of my ability not to question it

North bowed his head to the reproof In some sort of justly unjust way
he felt that he deserved it I can say no more sir I am afraid I
am helpless in this matteras I have been in others I see that the
evidence is against me but it is my duty to carry my efforts as far
as I can and I will do so Vickers bowed stiffly and wished him good
morning Authority however wellmeaning in private life has in its
official capacity a natural dislike to those dissatisfied persons who
persist in pushing inquiries to extremities

North going out with saddened spirits met in the passage a beautiful
young girl It was Sylvia coming to visit her father He lifted his hat
and looked after her He guessed that she was the daughter of the man he
had leftthe wife of the Captain Frere concerning whom he had heard so
much North was a man whose morbidly excited brain was prone to strange
fancies and it seemed to him that beneath the clear blue eyes that
flashed upon him for a moment lay a hint of future sadness in which
in some strange way he himself was to bear part He stared after her
figure until it disappeared and long after the dainty presence of the
young bridetrimly booted tightwaisted and neatlyglovedhad faded
with all its sunshine of gaiety and health from out of his mental
vision he still saw those blue eyes and that cloud of golden hair




CHAPTER XVII CAPTAIN AND MRS FRERE



Sylvia had become the wife of Maurice Frere The wedding created
excitement in the convict settlement for Maurice Frere though
oppressed by the secret shame at open matrimony which affects men of his
character could not in decencyseeing how good a thing for him was
this wealthy alliancedemand unceremonious nuptials So after the
fashion of the townthere being no continent or Scotland adjacent
as a hiding place for bridal blushesthe alliance was entered into with
due pomp of ball and supper bride and bridegroom departing through the
golden afternoon to the nearest of Major Vickerss stations Thence it
had been arranged they should return after a fortnight and take ship
for Sydney

Major Vickers affectionate though he was to the man whom he believed
to be the saviour of his child had no notion of allowing him to live
on Sylvias fortune He had settled his daughters portionten thousand
poundsupon herself and children and had informed Frere that he
expected him to live upon an income of his own earning After many
consultations between the pair it had been arranged that a civil
appointment in Sydney would best suit the bridegroom who was to sell
out of the service This notion was Freres own He never cared for
military duty and had moreover private debts to no inconsiderable
amount By selling his commission he would be enabled at once to pay
these debts and render himself eligible for any wellpaid post under
the Colonial Government that the interest of his fatherinlaw and his
own reputation as a convict disciplinarian might procure Vickers would
fain have kept his daughter with him but he unselfishly acquiesced in
the scheme admitting that Freres plea as to the comforts she would
derive from the society to be found in Sydney was a valid one

You can come over and see us when we get settled papa said Sylvia
with a young matrons pride of place and we can come and see you
Hobart Town is very pretty but I want to see the world

You should go to London Poppet said Maurice thats the place
Isnt it sir

Oh London cries Sylvia clapping her hands And Westminster Abbey
and the Tower and St Jamess Palace and Hyde Park and Fleetstreet
Sir said Dr Johnson let us take a walk down Fleetstreet Do you
remember in Mr Crokers book Maurice No you dont I know because
you only looked at the pictures and then read Pierce Egans account of
the Topping Fight between Bob Gaynor and Ned Neal or some such person

Little girls should be seen and not heard said Maurice between a
laugh and a blush You have no business to read my books

Why not she asked with a gaiety which already seemed a little
strained husband and wife should have no secrets from each other
sir Besides I want you to read my books I am going to read Shelley to
you

Dont my dear said Maurice simply I cant understand him

This little scene took place at the dinnertable of Freres cottage in
New Town to which Major Vickers had been invited in order that future
plans might be discussed

I dont want to go to Port Arthur said the bride later in the
evening Maurice there can be no necessity to go there

Well said Maurice I want to have a look at the place I ought to be
familiar with all phases of convict discipline you know

There is likely to be a report ordered upon the death of a prisoner
said Vickers The chaplain a fussy but wellmeaning person has been
memorializing about it You may as well do it as anybody else Maurice

Ay And save the expenses of the trip said Maurice

But it is so melancholy cried Sylvia

The most delightful place in the island my dear I was there for a few
days once and I really was charmed

It was remarkableso Vickers thoughthow each of these newlymated
ones had caught something of the others manner of speech Sylvia was
less choice in her mode of utterance Frere more so He caught himself
wondering which of the two methods both would finally adopt

But those dogs and sharks and things Oh Maurice havent we had
enough of convicts

Enough Why Im going to make my living out of em said Maurice
with his most natural manner

Sylvia sighed

Play something darling said her father and so the girl sitting
down to the piano trilled and warbled in her pure young voice until
the Port Arthur question floated itself away upon waves of melody
and was heard of no more for that time But upon pursuing the subject
Sylvia found her husband firm He wanted to go and he would go Having
once assured himself that it was advantageous to him to do a certain
thing the native obstinacy of the animal urged him to do it despite all
opposition from others and Sylvia having had her first cry over the
question of the visit gave up the point This was the first difference
of their short married life and she hastened to condone it In the
sunshine of Love and Marriagefor Maurice at first really loved her
and love curbing the worst part of him brought to him as it brings
to all of us that gentleness and abnegation of self which is the only
token and assurance of a love aught but animalSylvias fears and
doubts melted away as the mists melt in the beams of morning A young
girl with passionate fancy with honest and noble aspiration but with
the dark shadow of her early mental sickness brooding upon her childlike
nature Marriage made her a woman by developing in her a womans trust
and pride in the man to whom she had voluntarily given herself Yet
byandby out of this sentiment arose a new and strange source of
anxiety Having accepted her position as a wife and put away from her
all doubts as to her own capacity for loving the man to whom she had
allied herself she began to be haunted by a dread lest he might do
something which would lessen the affection she bore him On one or two
occasions she had been forced to confess that her husband was more of
an egotist than she cared to think He demanded of her no great
sacrificeshad he done so she would have found in making them
the pleasure that women of her nature always find in such
selfmortificationbut he now and then intruded on her that disregard
for the feeling of others which was part of his character He was fond
of heralmost too passionately fond for her staider likingbut he was
unused to thwart his own will in anything least of all in those seeming
trifles for the consideration of which true selfishness bethinks
itself Did she want to read when he wanted to walk he goodhumouredly
put aside her book with an assumption that a walk with him must of
necessity be the most pleasing thing in the world Did she want to
walk when he wanted to rest he laughingly set up his laziness as an
allsufficient plea for her remaining within doors He was at no pains
to conceal his weariness when she read her favourite books to him If
he felt sleepy when she sang or played he slept without apology If
she talked about a subject in which he took no interest he turned the
conversation remorselessly He would not have wittingly offended her
but it seemed to him natural to yawn when he was weary to sleep when
he was fatigued and to talk only about those subjects which interested
him Had anybody told him that he was selfish he would have been
astonished Thus it came about that Sylvia one day discovered that she
led two livesone in the body and one in the spiritand that with
her spiritual existence her husband had no share This discovery alarmed
her but then she smiled at it As if Maurice could be expected to take
interest in all my silly fancies said she and despite a harassing
thought that these same fancies were not foolish but were the best and
brightest portion of her she succeeded in overcoming her uneasiness
A mans thoughts are different from a womans she said he has his
business and his worldly cares of which a woman knows nothing I must
comfort him and not worry him with my follies

As for Maurice he grew sometimes rather troubled in his mind He could
not understand his wife Her nature was an enigma to him her mind was
a puzzle which would not be pieced together with the rectangular
correctness of ordinary life He had known her from a child had loved
her from a child and had committed a mean and cruel crime to obtain
her but having got her he was no nearer to the mystery of her than
before She was all his own he thought Her golden hair was for his
fingers her lips were for his caress her eyes looked love upon him
alone Yet there were times when her lips were cold to his kisses and
her eyes looked disdainfully upon his coarser passion He would catch
her musing when he spoke to her much as she would catch him sleeping
when she read to himbut she awoke with a start and a blush at her
forgetfulness which he never did He was not a man to brood over these
things and after some reflective pipes and ineffectual rubbings of his
head he gave it up How was it possible indeed for him to solve the
mental enigma when the woman herself was to him a physical riddle It
was extraordinary that the child he had seen growing up by his side day
by day should be a young woman with little secrets now to be revealed
to him for the first time He found that she had a mole on her neck and
remembered that he had noticed it when she was a child Then it was a
thing of no moment now it was a marvellous discovery He was in daily
wonderment at the treasure he had obtained He marvelled at her feminine
devices of dress and adornment Her dainty garments seemed to him
perfumed with the odour of sanctity

The fact was that the patron of Sarah Purfoy had not met with many
virtuous women and had but just discovered what a dainty morsel Modesty
was




CHAPTER XVIII IN THE HOSPITAL



The hospital of Port Arthur was not a cheerful place but to the
tortured and unnerved Rufus Dawes it seemed a paradise There at
leastdespite the roughness and contempt with which his gaolers
ministered to himhe felt that he was considered There at least he was
free from the enforced companionship of the men whom he loathed and to
whose level he felt with mental agony unspeakable that he was daily
sinking Throughout his long term of degradation he had as yet aided
by the memory of his sacrifice and his love preserved something of his
selfrespect but he felt that he could not preserve it long Little by
little he had come to regard himself as one out of the pale of love and
mercy as one tormented of fortune plunged into a deep into which the
eye of Heaven did not penetrate Since his capture in the garden of
Hobart Town he had given loose rein to his rage and his despair I
am forgotten or despised I have no name in the world what matter if
I become like one of these It was under the influence of this feeling
that he had picked up the cat at the command of Captain Burgess As the
unhappy Kirkland had said As well you as another and truly what was
he that he should cherish sentiments of honour or humanity But he had
miscalculated his own capacity for evil As he flogged he blushed and
when he flung down the cat and stripped his own back for punishment he
felt a fierce joy in the thought that his baseness would be atoned for
in his own blood Even when unnerved and faint from the hideous ordeal
he flung himself upon his knees in the cell he regretted only the
impotent ravings that the torture had forced from him He could have
bitten out his tongue for his blasphemous utteringsnot because they
were blasphemous but because their utterance by revealing his agony
gave their triumph to his tormentors When North found him he was in
the very depth of this abasement and he repulsed his comforternot so
much because he had seen him flogged as because he had heard him cry
The selfreliance and force of will which had hitherto sustained him
through his selfimposed trial had failed himhe feltat the moment
when he needed it most and the man who had with unflinched front faced
the gallows the desert and the sea confessed his debased humanity
beneath the physical torture of the lash He had been flogged before
and had wept in secret at his degradation but he now for the first
time comprehended how terrible that degradation might be made for he
realized how the agony of the wretched body can force the soul to
quit its last poor refuge of assumed indifference and confess itself
conquered

Not many months before one of the companions of the chain suffering
under Burgesss tender mercies had killed his mate when at work
with him and carrying the body on his back to the nearest gang had
surrendered himselfgoing to his death thanking God he had at last
found a way of escape from his miseries which no one would envy
himsave his comrades The heart of Dawes had been filled with horror
at a deed so bloody and he had with others commented on the cowardice
of the man that would thus shirk the responsibility of that state of
life in which it had pleased man and the devil to place him Now he
understood how and why the crime had been committed and felt only pity
Lying awake with back that burned beneath its lotioned rags when lights
were low in the breathful silence of the hospital he registered in his
heart a terrible oath that he would die ere he would again be made such
hideous sport for his enemies In this frame of mind with such shreds
of honour and worth as had formerly clung to him blown away in the
whirlwind of his passion he bethought him of the strange man who had
deigned to clasp his hand and call him brother He had wept no unmanly
tears at this sudden flow of tenderness in one whom he had thought as
callous as the rest He had been touched with wondrous sympathy at the
confession of weakness made to him in a moment when his own weakness
had overcome him to his shame Soothed by the brief rest that his
fortnight of hospital seclusion had afforded him he had begun in a
languid and speculative way to turn his thoughts to religion He had
read of martyrs who had borne agonies unspeakable upheld by their
confidence in Heaven and God In his old wild youth he had scoffed at
prayers and priests in the hate to his kind that had grown upon him
with his later years he had despised a creed that told men to love one
another God is love my brethren said the chaplain on Sundays and
all the week the thongs of the overseer cracked and the cat hissed and
swung Of what practical value was a piety that preached but did not
practise It was admirable for the religious instructor to tell a
prisoner that he must not give way to evil passions but must bear his
punishment with meekness It was only right that he should advise him to
put his trust in God But as a hardened prisoner convicted of getting
drunk in an unlicensed house of entertainment had said Gods terrible
far from Port Arthur

Rufus Dawes had smiled at the spectacle of priests admonishing men who
knew what he knew and had seen what he had seen for the trivialities of
lying and stealing He had believed all priests impostors or fools
all religion a mockery and a lie But now finding how utterly his own
strength had failed him when tried by the rude test of physical pain he
began to think that this Religion which was talked of so largely was
not a mere bundle of legend and formulae but must have in it something
vital and sustaining Broken in spirit and weakened in body with
faith in his own will shaken he longed for something to lean upon and
turnedas all men turn when in such caseto the Unknown Had now there
been at hand some Christian priest some Christianspirited man even no
matter of what faith to pour into the ears of this poor wretch words of
comfort and grace to rend away from him the garment of sullenness and
despair in which he had wrapped himself to drag from him a confession
of his unworthiness his obstinacy and his hasty judgment and to cheer
his fainting soul with promise of immortality and justice he might have
been saved from his after fate but there was no such man He asked
for the chaplain North was fighting the Convict Department seeking
vengeance for Kirkland and victim of clerks with the cold spurt of
the pen was pushed hither and thither referred here snubbed there
bowed out in another place Rufus Dawes half ashamed of himself for his
request waited a long morning and then saw respectfully ushered into
his cell as his souls physicianMeekin




CHAPTER XIX THE CONSOLATIONS OF RELIGION



Well my good man said Meekin soothingly so you wanted to see me

I asked for the chaplain said Rufus Dawes his anger with himself
growing apace I am the chaplain returned Meekin with dignity as
who should saynone of your brandydrinking peajacketed Norths but
a Respectable chaplain who is the friend of a Bishop

I thought that Mr North was

Mr North has left sir said Meekin dryly but I will hear what
you have to say There is no occasion to go constable wait outside the
door

Rufus Dawes shifted himself on the wooden bench and resting his
scarcelyhealed back against the wall smiled bitterly Dont be
afraid sir I am not going to harm you he said I only wanted to
talk a little

Do you read your Bible Dawes asked Meekin by way of reply It
would be better to read your Bible than to talk I think You must
humble yourself in prayer Dawes

I have read it said Dawes still lying back and watching him

But is your mind softened by its teachings Do you realize the Infinite
Mercy of God Who has compassion Dawes upon the greatest sinners The
convict made a move of impatience The old sickening barren cant of
piety was to be recommenced then He came asking for bread and they
gave him the usual stone

Do you believe that there is a God Mr Meekin

Abandoned sinner Do you insult a clergyman by such a question

Because I think sometimes that if there is He must often be
dissatisfied at the way things are done here said Dawes half to
himself

I can listen to no mutinous observations prisoner said Meekin Do
not add blasphemy to your other crimes I fear that all conversation
with you in your present frame of mind would be worse than useless I
will mark a few passages in your Bible that seem to me appropriate to
your condition and beg you to commit them to memory Hailes the door
if you please

So with a bow the consoler departed

Rufus Dawes felt his heart grow sick North had gone then The only man
who had seemed to have a heart in his bosom had gone The only man
who had dared to clasp his horny and bloodstained hand and call him
brother had gone Turning his head he saw through the windowwide
open and unbarred for Nature at Port Arthur had no need of barsthe
lovely bay smooth as glass glittering in the afternoon sun the long
quay spotted with groups of particoloured chaingangs and heard
mingling with the soft murmur of the waves and the gentle rustling of
the trees the neverceasing clashing of irons and the eternal click
of hammer Was he to be for ever buried in this whitened sepulchre shut
out from the face of Heaven and mankind

The appearance of Hailes broke his reverie Heres a book for you
said he with a grin Parson sent it

Rufus Dawes took the Bible and placing it on his knees turned to the
places indicated by slips of paper embracing some twenty marked texts

Parson says hell come and hear you tomorrer and youre to keep the
book clean

Keep the book clean and hear him Did Meekin think that he was a
charity school boy The utter incapacity of the chaplain to understand
his wants was so sublime that it was nearly ridiculous enough to make
him laugh He turned his eyes downwards to the texts Good Meekin in
the fullness of his stupidity had selected the fiercest denunciations
of bard and priest The most notable of the Psalmists curses upon his
enemies the most furious of Isaiahs ravings anent the forgetfulness
of the national worship the most terrible thunderings of apostle and
evangelist against idolatry and unbelief were grouped together and
presented to Dawes to soothe him All the material horrors of Meekins
faithstripped by force of dissociation from the context of all
poetic feeling and local colouringwere launched at the suffering
sinner by Meekins ignorant hand The miserable man seeking for
consolation and peace turned over the leaves of the Bible only to find
himself threatened with the pains of Hell the neverdying worm
the unquenchable fire the bubbling brimstone the bottomless pit
from out of which the smoke of his torment should ascend for ever and
ever Before his eyes was held no image of a tender Saviour with hands
soft to soothe and eyes brimming with ineffable pity dying crucified
that he and other malefactors might have hope by thinking on such
marvellous humanity The worthy Pharisee who was sent to him to teach
him how mankind is to be redeemed with Love preached only that harsh
Law whose barbarous power died with the gentle Nazarene on Calvary

Repelled by this unlookedfor ending to his hopes he let the book fall
to the ground Is there then nothing but torment for me in this world
or the next he groaned shuddering Presently his eyes sought his
right hand resting upon it as though it were not his own or had some
secret virtue which made it different from the other He would not
have done this He would not have thrust upon me these savage judgments
these dreadful threats of Hell and Death He called me Brother And
filled with a strange wild pity for himself and yearning love towards
the man who befriended him he fell to nursing the hand on which Norths
tears had fallen moaning and rocking himself to and fro

Meekin in the morning found his pupil more sullen than ever

Have you learned these texts my man said he cheerfully willing not
to be angered with his uncouth and unpromising convert

Rufus Dawes pointed with his foot to the Bible which still lay on the
floor as he had left it the night before No

No Why not

I would learn no such words as those I would rather forget them

Forget them My good man I

Rufus Dawes sprang up in sudden wrath and pointing to his cell door
with a gesture thatchained and degraded as he washad something of
dignity in it cried What do you know about the feelings of such as
I Take your book and yourself away When I asked for a priest I had no
thought of you Begone

Meekin despite the halo of sanctity which he felt should surround him
found his gentility melt all of a sudden Adventitious distinctions had
disappeared for the instant The pair had become simply man and man
and the sleek priestmaster quailing before the outraged manhood of the
convictpenitent picked up his Bible and backed out

That man Dawes is very insolent said the insulted chaplain to
Burgess He was brutal to me todayquite brutal

Was he said Burgess Had too long a spell I expect Ill send him
back to work tomorrow

It would be well said Meekin if he had some employment




CHAPTER XX A NATURAL PENITENTIARY



The employment at Port Arthur consisted chiefly of agriculture
shipbuilding and tanning Dawes who was in the chaingang was put to
chaingang labour that is to say bringing down logs from the forest
or lumbering timber on the wharf This work was not light An
ingenious calculator had discovered that the pressure of the log upon
the shoulder was wont to average 125 lbs Members of the chaingang were
dressed in yellow andby way of encouraging the othershad the word
Felon stamped upon conspicuous parts of their raiment

This was the sort of life Rufus Dawes led In the summertime he rose
at halfpast five in the morning and worked until six in the evening
getting threequarters of an hour for breakfast and one hour for
dinner Once a week he had a clean shirt and once a fortnight clean
socks If he felt sick he was permitted to report his case to the
medical officer If he wanted to write a letter he could ask permission
of the Commandant and send the letter open through that Almighty
Officer who could stop it if he thought necessary If he felt himself
aggrieved by any order he was to obey it instantly but might complain
afterwards if he thought fit to the Commandant In making any
complaint against an officer or constable it was strictly ordered that
a prisoner must be most respectful in his manner and language when
speaking of or to such officer or constable He was held responsible
only for the safety of his chains and for the rest was at the mercy of
his gaoler These gaolersowning right of search entry into cells at
all hours and other droits of seigneurywere responsible only to the
Commandant who was responsible only to the Governor that is to say
to nobody but God and his own conscience The jurisdiction of the
Commandant included the whole of Tasmans Peninsula with the islands
and waters within three miles thereof and save the making of certain
returns to headquarters his power was unlimited

A word as to the position and appearance of this place of punishment
Tasmans Peninsula is as we have said before in the form of an earring
with a double drop The lower drop is the larger and is ornamented
so to speak with bays At its southern extremity is a deep indentation
called Maingon Bay bounded east and west by the organpipe rocks of
Cape Raoul and the giant form of Cape Pillar From Maingon Bay an arm
of the ocean cleaves the rocky walls in a northerly direction On the
western coast of this seaarm was the settlement in front of it was a
little island where the dead were buried called The Island of the
Dead Ere the incoming convict passed the purple beauty of this convict
Golgotha his eyes were attracted by a point of grey rock covered with
white buildings and swarming with life This was Point Puer the
place of confinement for boys from eight to twenty years of age It
was astonishingmany honest folks averredhow ungrateful were these
juvenile convicts for the goods the Government had provided for them
From the extremity of Long Bay as the extension of the seaarm was
named a convictmade tramroad ran due north through the nearly
impenetrable thicket to Norfolk Bay In the mouth of Norfolk Bay was
Woody Island This was used as a signal station and an armed boats
crew was stationed there To the north of Woody Island lay Onetree
Pointthe southernmost projection of the drop of the earring and the
sea that ran between narrowed to the eastward until it struck on the
sandy bar of Eaglehawk Neck Eaglehawk Neck was the link that connected
the two drops of the earring It was a strip of sand four hundred and
fifty yards across On its eastern side the blue waters of Pirates Bay
that is to say of the Southern Ocean poured their unchecked force The
isthmus emerged from a wild and terrible coastline into whose bowels
the ravenous sea had bored strange caverns resonant with perpetual
roar of tortured billows At one spot in this wilderness the ocean had
penetrated the wall of rock for two hundred feet and in stormy weather
the salt spray rose through a perpendicular shaft more than five hundred
feet deep This place was called the Devils Blowhole The upper drop
of the earring was named Forrestiers Peninsula and was joined to the
mainland by another isthmus called East Bay Neck Forrestiers
Peninsula was an almost impenetrable thicket growing to the brink of a
perpendicular cliff of basalt

Eaglehawk Neck was the door to the prison and it was kept bolted On
the narrow strip of land was built a guardhouse where soldiers from
the barrack on the mainland relieved each other night and day and on
stages set out in the water in either side watchdogs were chained
The station officer was charged to pay special attention to the feeding
and care of these useful beasts being ordered to report to the
Commandant whenever any one of them became useless It may be added
that the bay was not innocent of sharks Westward from Eaglehawk Neck
and Woody Island lay the dreaded Coal Mines Sixty of the marked men
were stationed here under a strong guard At the Coal Mines was the
northernmost of that ingenious series of semaphores which rendered
escape almost impossible The wild and mountainous character of the
peninsula offered peculiar advantages to the signalmen On the summit
of the hill which overlooked the guardtowers of the settlement was a
gigantic gumtree stump upon the top of which was placed a semaphore
This semaphore communicated with the two wings of the prisonEaglehawk
Neck and the Coal Minesby sending a line of signals right across the
peninsula Thus the settlement communicated with Mount Arthur Mount
Arthur with Onetree Hill Onetree Hill with Mount Communication and
Mount Communication with the Coal Mines On the other side the signals
would run thusthe settlement to Signal Hill Signal Hill to Woody
Island Woody Island to Eaglehawk Did a prisoner escape from the Coal
Mines the guard at Eaglehawk Neck could be aroused and the whole
island informed of the bolt in less than twenty minutes With these
advantages of nature and art the prison was held to be the most secure
in the world Colonel Arthur reported to the Home Government that
the spot which bore his name was a natural penitentiary The worthy
disciplinarian probably took as a personal compliment the polite
forethought of the Almighty in thus considerately providing for the
carrying out of the celebrated Regulations for Convict Discipline




CHAPTER XXI A VISIT OF INSPECTION



One afternoon everactive semaphores transmitted a piece of intelligence
which set the peninsula agog Captain Frere having arrived from
headquarters with orders to hold an inquiry into the death of
Kirkland was not unlikely to make a progress through the stations
and it behoved the keepers of the Natural Penitentiary to produce
their Penitents in good case Burgess was in high spirits at finding so
congenial a soul selected for the task of reporting upon him

Its only a nominal thing old man Frere said to his former comrade
when they met That parson has made meddling and they want to close
his mouth

I am glad to have the opportunity of showing you and Mrs Frere the
place returned Burgess I must try and make your stay as pleasant
as I can though Im afraid that Mrs Frere will not find much to amuse
her

Frankly Captain Burgess said Sylvia I would rather have gone
straight to Sydney My husband however was obliged to come and of
course I accompanied him

You will not have much society said Meekin who was of the welcoming
party Mrs Datchett the wife of one of our stipendiaries is the only
lady here and I hope to have the pleasure of making you acquainted with
her this evening at the Commandants Mr McNab whom you know is in
command at the Neck and cannot leave or you would have seen him

I have planned a little party said Burgess but I fear that it will
not be so successful as I could wish

You wretched old bachelor said Frere you should get married like
me

Ah said Burgess with a bow that would be difficult

Sylvia was compelled to smile at the compliment made in the presence of
some twenty prisoners who were carrying the various trunks and packages
up the hill and she remarked that the said prisoners grinned at the
Commandants clumsy courtesy I dont like Captain Burgess Maurice
she said in the interval before dinner I dare say he did flog that
poor fellow to death He looks as if he could do it

Nonsense said Maurice pettishly hes a good fellow enough
Besides Ive seen the doctors certificate Its a trumpedup story I
cant understand your absurd sympathy with prisoners

Dont they sometimes deserve sympathy

No certainly nota set of lying scoundrels You are always whining
over them Sylvia I dont like it and Ive told you before about it

Sylvia said nothing Maurice was often guilty of these small
brutalities and she had learnt that the best way to meet them was
by silence Unfortunately silence did not mean indifference for the
reproof was unjust and nothing stings a womans fine sense like an
injustice Burgess had prepared a feast and the Society of Port
Arthur was present Father Flaherty Meekin Doctor Macklewain and Mr
and Mrs Datchett had been invited and the diningroom was resplendent
with glass and flowers

Ive a fellow who was a professional gardener said Burgess to Sylvia
during the dinner and I make use of his talents

We have a professional artist also said Macklewain with a sort of
pride That picture of the Prisoner of Chillon yonder was painted by
him A very meritorious production is it not

Ive got the place full of curiosities said Burgess quite a
collection Ill show them to you tomorrow Those napkin rings were
made by a prisoner

Ah cried Frere taking up the daintilycarved bone very neat

That is some of Rexs handiwork said Meekin He is very clever at
these trifles He made me a papercutter that was really a work of art

We will go down to the Neck tomorrow or next day Mrs Frere said
Burgess and you shall see the Blowhole It is a curious place

Is it far asked Sylvia

Oh no We shall go in the train

The train

Yesdont look so astonished Youll see it tomorrow Oh you Hobart
Town ladies dont know what we can do here

What about this Kirkland business Frere asked I suppose I can have
half an hour with you in the morning and take the depositions

Any time you like my dear fellow said Burgess Its all the same to
me

I dont want to make more fuss than I can help Frere said
apologeticallythe dinner had been goodbut I must send these people
up a full true and particular dont you know

Of course cried Burgess with friendly nonchalance Thats all
right I want Mrs Frere to see Point Puer

Where the boys are asked Sylvia

Exactly Nearly three hundred of em Well go down tomorrow and you
shall be my witness Mrs Frere as to the way they are treated

Indeed said Sylvia protesting I would rather not II dont
take the interest in these things that I ought perhaps They are very
dreadful to me

Nonsense said Frere with a scowl Well come Burgess of course
The next two days were devoted to sightseeing Sylvia was taken through
the hospital and the workshops shown the semaphores and shut up by
Maurice in a dark cell Her husband and Burgess seemed to treat the
prison like a tame animal whom they could handle at their leisure and
whose natural ferocity was kept in check by their superior intelligence
This bringing of a young and pretty woman into immediate contact with
bolts and bars had about it an incongruity which pleased them Maurice
penetrated everywhere questioned the prisoners jested with the
gaolers even in the munificence of his heart bestowed tobacco on the
sick

With such graceful rattlings of dry bones they got by and by to Point
Puer where a luncheon had been provided

An unlucky accident had occurred at Point Puer that morning however
and the place was in a suppressed ferment A refractory little thief
named Peter Brown aged twelve years had jumped off the high rock and
drowned himself in full view of the constables These jumpings off had
become rather frequent lately and Burgess was enraged at one happening
on this particular day If he could by any possibility have brought the
corpse of poor little Peter Brown to life again he would have soundly
whipped it for its impertinence

It is most unfortunate he said to Frere as they stood in the cell
where the little body was laid that it should have happened today

Oh says Frere frowning down upon the young face that seemed to smile
up at him It cant be helped I know those young devils Theyd do it
out of spite What sort of a character had he

Very badJohnson the book

Johnson bringing it the two saw Peter Browns iniquities set down
in the neatest of running hand and the record of his punishments
ornamented in quite an artistic way with flourishes of red ink

20th November disorderly conduct 12 lashes 24th November insolence
to hospital attendant diet reduced 4th December stealing cap from
another prisoner 12 lashes 15th December absenting himself at roll
call two days cells 23rd December insolence and insubordination two
days cells 8th January insolence and insubordination 12 lashes
20th January insolence and insubordination 12 lashes 22nd February
insolence and insubordination 12 lashes and one weeks solitary 6th
March insolence and insubordination 20 lashes

That was the last asked Frere

Yes sir says Johnson

And then hehumdid it

Just so sir That was the way of it

Just so The magnificent system starved and tortured a child of twelve
until he killed himself That was the way of it

After luncheon the party made a progress Everything was most admirable
There was a long schoolroom where such men as Meekin taught how Christ
loved little children and behind the schoolroom were the cells and the
constables and the little yard where they gave their twenty lashes
Sylvia shuddered at the array of faces From the stolid nineteen years
old booby of the Kentish hopfields to the wizened shrewd ten years
old Bohemian of the London streets all degrees and grades of juvenile
vice grinned in untamable wickedness or snuffed in affected piety
Suffer little children to come unto Me and forbid them not for of
such is the Kingdom of Heaven said or is reported to have said the
Founder of our Established Religion Of such it seemed that a large
number of Honourable Gentlemen together with Her Majestys faithful
commons in Parliament assembled had done their best to create a Kingdom
of Hell

After the farce had been played again and the children had stood up
and sat down and sung a hymn and told how many twice five were and
repeated their belief in One God the Father Almighty maker of Heaven
and Earth the party reviewed the workshops and saw the church and
went everywhere but into the room where the body of Peter Brown aged
twelve lay starkly on its wooden bench staring at the gaol roof which
was between it and Heaven

Just outside this room Sylvia met with a little adventure Meekin had
stopped behind and Burgess being suddenly summoned for some official
duty Frere had gone with him leaving his wife to rest on a bench that
placed at the summit of the cliff overlooked the sea While resting
thus she became aware of another presence and turning her head
beheld a small boy with his cap in one hand and a hammer in the other
The appearance of the little creature clad in a uniform of grey cloth
that was too large for him and holding in his withered little hand a
hammer that was too heavy for him had something pathetic about it

What is it you mite asked Sylvia

We thought you might have seen him mum said the little figure
opening its blue eyes with wonder at the kindness of the tone Him
Whom

Cranky Brown mum returned the child him as did it this morning Me
and Billy knowed him mum he was a mate of ours and we wanted to know
if he looked happy

What do you mean child said she with a strange terror at her heart
and then filled with pity at the aspect of the little being she drew
him to her with sudden womanly instinct and kissed him He looked up
at her with joyful surprise Oh he said

Sylvia kissed him again

Does nobody ever kiss you poor little man said she

Mother used to was the reply but shes at home Oh mum with a
sudden crimsoning of the little face may I fetch Billy

And taking courage from the bright young face he gravely marched to an
angle of the rock and brought out another little creature with another
grey uniform and another hammer

This is Billy mum he said Billy never had no mother Kiss Billy

The young wife felt the tears rush to her eyes You two poor babies
she cried And then forgetting that she was a lady dressed in silk
and lace she fell on her knees in the dust and folding the friendless
pair in her arms wept over them

What is the matter Sylvia said Frere when he came up Youve been
crying

Nothing Maurice at least I will tell you by and by

When they were alone that evening she told him of the two little boys
and he laughed Artful little humbugs he said and supported his
argument by so many illustrations of the precocious wickedness of
juvenile felons that his wife was half convinced against her will


     


Unfortunately when Sylvia went away Tommy and Billy put into execution
a plan which they had carried in their poor little heads for some weeks

I can do it now said Tommy I feel strong

Will it hurt much Tommy said Billy who was not so courageous

Not so much as a whipping

Im afraid Oh Tom its so deep Dont leave me Tom

The bigger boy took his little handkerchief from his neck and with it
bound his own left hand to his companions right

Now I cant leave you

What was it the lady that kissed us said Tommy

Lord have pity on them two fatherless children repeated Tommy
Lets say it together

And so the two babies knelt on the brink of the cliff and raising the
bound hands together looked up at the sky and ungrammatically said
Lord have pity on we two fatherless children And then they kissed
each other and did it


     


The intelligence transmitted by the everactive semaphore reached the
Commandant in the midst of dinner and in his agitation he blurted it
out

These are the two poor things I saw in the morning cried Sylvia Oh
Maurice these two poor babies driven to suicide

Condemning their young souls to everlasting fire said Meekin
piously

Mr Meekin How can you talk like that Poor little creatures Oh
its horrible Maurice take me away And she burst into a passion of
weeping I cant help it maam says Burgess rudely ashamed It
aint my fault

Shes nervous says Frere leading her away You must excuse her
Come and lie down dearest

I will not stay here longer said she Let us go tomorrow

We cant said Frere

Oh yes we can I insist Maurice if you love me take me away

Well said Maurice moved by her evident grief Ill try

He spoke to Burgess Burgess this matter has unsettled my wife so
that she wants to leave at once I must visit the Neck you know How
can we do it

Well says Burgess if the wind only holds the brig could go
round to Pirates Bay and pick you up Youll only be a night at the
barracks

I think that would be best said Frere Well start tomorrow
please and if youll give me a pen and ink Ill be obliged

I hope you are satisfied said Burgess

Oh yes quite said Frere I must recommend more careful supervision
at Point Puer though It will never do to have these young blackguards
slipping through our fingers in this way

So a neatly written statement of the occurrence was appended to the
ledgers in which the names of William Tomkins and Thomas Grove were
entered Macklewain held an inquest and nobody troubled about them any
more Why should they The prisons of London were full of such Tommys
and Billys


     



Sylvia passed through the rest of her journey in a dream of terror The
incident of the children had shaken her nerves and she longed to be
away from the place and its associations Even Eaglehawk Neck with its
curious dog stages and its natural pavement did not interest her
McNabs blandishments were wearisome She shuddered as she gazed
into the boiling abyss of the Blowhole and shook with fear as the
Commandants train rattled over the dangerous tramway that wound
across the precipice to Long Bay The train was composed of a number
of low wagons pushed and dragged up the steep inclines by convicts who
drew themselves up in the wagons when the trucks dashed down the slope
and acted as drags Sylvia felt degraded at being thus drawn by human
beings and trembled when the lash cracked and the convicts answered to
the stinglike cattle Moreover there was among the foremost of these
beasts of burden a face that had dimly haunted her girlhood and
only lately vanished from her dreams This face looked on hershe
thoughtwith bitterest loathing and scorn and she felt relieved when
at the midday halt its owner was ordered to fall out from the rest and
was with four others rechained for the homeward journey Frere struck
with the appearance of the five said By Jove Poppet there are our
old friends Rex and Dawes and the others They wont let em come all
the way because they are such a desperate lot they might make a rush
for it Sylvia comprehended now the face was the face of Dawes and
as she looked after him she saw him suddenly raise his hands above his
head with a motion that terrified her She felt for an instant a great
shock of pitiful recollection Staring at the group she strove to
recall when and how Rufus Dawes the wretch from whose clutches her
husband had saved her had ever merited her pity but her clouded memory
could not complete the picture and as the wagons swept round a curve
and the group disappeared she awoke from her reverie with a sigh

Maurice she whispered how is it that the sight of that man always
makes me sad

Her husband frowned and then caressing her bade her forget the man
and the place and her fears I was wrong to have insisted on your
coming he said They stood on the deck of the Sydneybound vessel the
next morning and watched the Natural Penitentiary grow dim in the
distance You were not strong enough


     


Dawes said John Rex you love that girl Now that youve seen her
another mans wife and have been harnessed like a beast to drag him
along the road while he held her in his armsnow that youve seen and
suffered that perhaps youll join us

Rufus Dawes made a movement of agonized impatience

Youd better Youll never get out of this place any other way Come
be a man join us

No

It is your only chance Why refuse it Do you want to live here all
your life

I want no sympathy from you or any other I will not join you

Rex shrugged his shoulders and walked away If you think to get any
good out of that inquiry you are mightily mistaken said he as he
went Frere has put a stopper upon that youll find He spoke truly
Nothing more was heard of it only that some six months afterwards
Mr North when at Parramatta received an official letter in which the
expenditure of wax and printing and paper was as large as it could be
made which informed him that the ComptrollerGeneral of the Convict
Department had decided that further inquiry concerning the death of the
prisoner named in the margin was unnecessary and that some gentleman
with an utterly illegible signature had the honour to be his most
obedient servant




CHAPTER XXII GATHERING IN THE THREADS



Maurice found his favourable expectations of Sydney fully realized His
notable escape from death at Macquarie Harbour his alliance with the
daughter of so respected a colonist as Major Vickers and his reputation
as a convict disciplinarian rendered him a man of note He received a
vacant magistracy and became even more noted for hardness of heart and
artfulness of prison knowledge than before The convict population spoke
of him as that  Frere and registered vows of vengeance against
him which he laughedin his bluffnessto scorn

One anecdote concerning the method by which he shepherded his flock will
suffice to show his character and his value It was his custom to visit
the prisonyard at Hyde Park Barracks twice a week Visitors to convicts
were of course armed and the two pistolbutts that peeped from
Freres waistcoat attracted many a longing eye How easy would it be for
some fellow to pluck one forth and shatter the smiling hateful face of
the noted disciplinarian Frere however brave to rashness never would
bestow his weapons more safely but lounged through the yard with his
hands in the pockets of his shootingcoat and the deadly butts ready to
the hand of anyone bold enough to take them

One day a man named Kavanagh a captured absconder who had openly sworn
in the dock the death of the magistrate walked quickly up to him as he
was passing through the yard and snatched a pistol from his belt The
yard caught its breath and the attendant warder hearing the click of
the lock instinctively turned his head away so that he might not be
blinded by the flash But Kavanagh did not fire At the instant when
his hand was on the pistol he looked up and met the magnetic glance of
Freres imperious eyes An effort and the spell would have been broken
A twitch of the finger and his enemy would have fallen dead There was
an instant when that twitch of the finger could have been given but
Kavanagh let that instant pass The dauntless eye fascinated him He
played with the pistol nervously while all remained stupefied Frere
stood without withdrawing his hands from the pockets into which they
were plunged

Thats a fine pistol Jack he said at last

Kavanagh down whose white face the sweat was pouring burst into a
hideous laugh of relieved terror and thrust the weapon cocked as it
was back again into the magistrates belt

Frere slowly drew one hand from his pocket took the cocked pistol and
levelled it at his recent assailant Thats the best chance youll ever
get Jack said he

Kavanagh fell on his knees For Gods sake Captain Frere Frere
looked down on the trembling wretch and then uncocked the pistol with
a laugh of ferocious contempt Get up you dog he said It takes a
better man than you to best me Bring him up in the morning Hawkins
and well give him fiveandtwenty

As he went outso great is the admiration for Powerthe poor devils in
the yard cheered him

One of the first things that this useful officer did upon his arrival
in Sydney was to inquire for Sarah Purfoy To his astonishment he
discovered that she was the proprietor of large export warehouses in
Pittstreet owned a neat cottage on one of the points of land which
jutted into the bay and was reputed to possess a banking account of no
inconsiderable magnitude He in vain applied his brains to solve this
mystery His castoff mistress had not been rich when she left Van
Diemens Landat least so she had assured him and appearances bore
out her assurance How had she accumulated this sudden wealth Above
all why had she thus invested it He made inquiries at the banks but
was snubbed for his pains Sydney banks in those days did some queer
business Mrs Purfoy had come to them fully accredited said the
manager with a smile

But where did she get the money asked the magistrate I am
suspicious of these sudden fortunes The woman was a notorious character
in Hobart Town and when she left hadnt a penny

My dear Captain Frere said the acute bankerhis father had been one
of the builders of the Rum Hospitalit is not the custom of our bank
to make inquiries into the previous history of its customers The bills
were good you may depend or we should not have honoured them Good
morning

The bills Frere saw but one explanation Sarah had received the
proceeds of some of Rexs rogueries Rexs letter to his father and
the mention of the sum of money in the old house in Blue Anchor Yard
flashed across his memory Perhaps Sarah had got the money from the
receiver and appropriated it But why invest it in an oil and tallow
warehouse He had always been suspicious of the woman because he had
never understood her and his suspicions redoubled Convinced that there
was some plot hatching he determined to use all the advantages that his
position gave him to discover the secret and bring it to light The name
of the man to whom Rexs letters had been addressed was Blicks
He would find out if any of the convicts under his care had heard of
Blicks Prosecuting his inquiries in the proper direction he soon
obtained a reply Blicks was a London receiver of stolen goods known to
at least a dozen of the black sheep of the Sydney fold He was reputed
to be enormously wealthy had often been tried but never convicted
Frere was thus not much nearer enlightenment than before and
an incident occurred a few months afterwards which increased his
bewilderment He had not been long established in his magistracy when
Blunt came to claim payment for the voyage of Sarah Purfoy Theres
that schooner going begging one may say sir said Blunt when the
office door was shut

What schooner

The Franklin

Now the Franklin was a vessel of three hundred and twenty tons which
plied between Norfolk Island and Sydney as the Osprey had plied in the
old days between Macquarie Harbour and Hobart Town I am afraid that is
rather stiff Blunt said Frere Thats one of the best billets going
you know I doubt if I have enough interest to get it for you Besides
he added eyeing the sailor critically you are getting oldish for that
sort of thing aint you

Phineas Blunt stretched his arms wide and opened his mouth full of
sound white teeth I am good for twenty years more yet sir he said
My father was trading to the Indies at seventyfive years of age Im
hearty enough thank God for barring a drop of rum now and then Ive
no vices to speak of However I aint in a hurry Captain for a month
or so only I thought Id jog your memory a bit d ye see

Oh youre not in a hurry where are you going then

Well said Blunt shifting on his seat uneasy under Freres
convictdisciplined eye Ive got a job on hand

Glad of it Im sure What sort of a job

A job of whaling said Blunt more uneasy than before

Oh thats it is it Your old line of business And who employs you
now There was no suspicion in the tone and had Blunt chosen to evade
the question he might have done so without difficulty but he replied
as one who had anticipated such questioning and had been advised how to
answer it

Mrs Purfoy

What cried Frere scarcely able to believe his ears

Shes got a couple of ships now Captain and she made me skipper of
one of em We look for beshdellamare bechedelamer and take a turn
at harpooning sometimes

Frere stared at Blunt who stared at the window There wasso the
instinct of the magistrate told himsome strange project afoot Yet
that common sense which so often misleads us urged that it was quite
natural Sarah should employ whaling vessels to increase her trade
Granted that there was nothing wrong about her obtaining the business
there was nothing strange about her owning a couple of whaling
vessels There were people in Sydney of no better origin who owned
halfadozen Oh said he And when do you start

Im expecting to get the word every day returned Blunt apparently
relieved and I thought Id just come and see you first in case of
anything falling in Frere played with a penknife on the table in
silence for a while allowing it to fall through his fingers with a
series of sharp clicks and then he said Where does she get the money
from

Blest if I know said Blunt in unaffected simplicity Thats beyond
me She says she saved it But thats all my eye you know

You dont know anything about it then cried Frere suddenly fierce

No not I

Because if theres any game on shed better take care he cried
relapsing in his excitement into the convict vernacular She knows
me Tell her that Ive got my eyes on her Let her remember her bargain
If she runs any rigs on me let her take care In his suspicious wrath
he so savagely and unwarily struck downwards with the open penknife
that it shut upon his fingers and cut him to the bone

Ill tell her said Blunt wiping his brow Im sure she wouldnt
go to sell you But Ill look in when I come back sir When he got
outside he drew a long breath By the Lord Harry but its a ticklish
game to play he said to himself with a lively recollection of the
dreaded Freres vehemence and theres only one woman in the world Id
be fool enough to play it for

Maurice Frere oppressed with suspicions ordered his horse that
afternoon and rode down to see the cottage which the owner of Purfoy
Stores had purchased He found it a low white building situated four
miles from the city at the extreme end of a tongue of land which ran
into the deep waters of the harbour A garden carefully cultivated
stood between the roadway and the house and in this garden he saw a man
digging

Does Mrs Purfoy live here he asked pushing open one of the iron
gates

The man replied in the affirmative staring at the visitor with some
suspicion

Is she at home

No

You are sure

If you dont believe me ask at the house was the reply given in the
uncourteous tone of a free man

Frere pushed his horse through the gate and walked up the broad and
wellkept carriage drive A manservant in livery answering his ring
told him that Mrs Purfoy had gone to town and then shut the door in
his face Frere more astonished than ever at these outward and visible
signs of independence paused indignant feeling half inclined to enter
despite opposition As he looked through the break of the trees he saw
the masts of a brig lying at anchor off the extremity of the point on
which the house was built and understood that the cottage commanded
communication by water as well as by land Could there be a special
motive in choosing such a situation or was it mere chance He was
uneasy but strove to dismiss his alarm

Sarah had kept faith with him so far She had entered upon a new and
more reputable life and why should he seek to imagine evil where
perhaps no evil was Blunt was evidently honest Women like Sarah
Purfoy often emerged into a condition of comparative riches and domestic
virtue It was likely that after all some wealthy merchant was
the real owner of the house and garden pleasure yacht and tallow
warehouse and that he had no cause for fear

The experienced convict disciplinarian did not rate the ability of John
Rex high enough

From the instant the convict had heard his sentence of life banishment
he had determined upon escaping and had brought all the powers of his
acute and unscrupulous intellect to the consideration of the best method
of achieving his purpose His first care was to procure money This he
thought to do by writing to Blick but when informed by Meekin of the
fate of his letter he adopted theto himless pleasant alternative of
procuring it through Sarah Purfoy

It was peculiar to the mans hard and ungrateful nature that despite
the attachment of the woman who had followed him to his place of
durance and had made it the object of her life to set him free he had
cherished for her no affection It was her beauty that had attracted
him when as Mr Lionel Crofton he swaggered in the nightsociety
of London Her talents and her devotion were secondary
considerationsuseful to him as attributes of a creature he owned but
not to be thought of when his fancy wearied of its choice During the
twelve years which had passed since his rashness had delivered him into
the hands of the law at the house of Green the coiner he had been
oppressed with no regrets for her fate He had indeed seen and
suffered so much that the old life had been put away from him When on
his return he heard that Sarah Purfoy was still in Hobart Town he was
glad for he knew that he had an ally who would do her utmost to help
himshe had shown that on board the Malabar But he was also sorry for
he remembered that the price she would demand for her services was his
affection and that had cooled long ago However he would make use of
her There might be a way to discard her if she proved troublesome

His pretended piety had accomplished the end he had assumed it for
Despite Freres exposure of his cryptograph he had won the confidence
of Meekin and into that worthy creatures ear he poured a strange and
sad story He was the son he said of a clergyman of the Church of
England whose real name such was his reverence for the cloth should
never pass his lips He was transported for a forgery which he did not
commit Sarah Purfoy was his wifehis erring lost and yet loved
wife She an innocent and trusting girl had determinedstrong in the
remembrance of that promise she had made at the altarto follow her
husband to his place of doom and had hired herself as ladysmaid to
Mrs Vickers Alas fever prostrated that husband on a bed of sickness
and Maurice Frere the profligate and the villain had taken advantage
of the wifes unprotected state to ruin her Rex darkly hinted how
the seducer made his power over the sick and helpless husband a weapon
against the virtue of the wife and so terrified poor Meekin that had it
not happened so long ago he would have thought it necessary to look
with some disfavour upon the boisterous soninlaw of Major Vickers

I bear him no illwill sir said Rex I did at first There was a
time when I could have killed him but when I had him in my power Ias
you knowforbore to strike No sir I could not commit murder

Very proper says Meekin very proper indeed God will punish him
in His own way and His own time continued Rex My great sorrow is
for the poor woman She is in Sydney I have heard living respectably
sir and my heart bleeds for her Here Rex heaved a sigh that would
have made his fortune on the boards

My poor fellow said Meekin Do you know where she is

I do sir

You might write to her

John Rex appeared to hesitate to struggle with himself and finally to
take a deep resolve No Mr Meekin I will not write

Why not

You know the orders sirthe Commandant reads all the letters sent
Could I write to my poor Sarah what other eyes were to read and he
watched the parson slyly

Nno you could not said Meekin at last

It is true sir said Rex letting his head sink on his breast The
next day Meekin blushing with the consciousness that what he was about
to do was wrong said to his penitent If you will promise to write
nothing that the Commandant might not see Rex I will send your letter
to your wife

Heaven bless you sir said Rex and took two days to compose an
epistle which should tell Sarah Purfoy how to act The letter was
a model of composition in one way It stated everything clearly and
succinctly Not a detail that could assist was omittednot a line that
could embarrass was suffered to remain John Rexs scheme of six months
deliberation was set down in the clearest possible manner He brought
his letter unsealed to Meekin Meekin looked at it with an interest that
was half suspicion Have I your word that there is nothing in this that
might not be read by the Commandant

John Rex was a bold man but at the sight of the deadly thing fluttering
open in the clergymans hand his knees knocked together Strong in his
knowledge of human nature however he pursued his desperate plan
Read it sir he said turning away his face reproachfully You are a
gentleman I can trust you

No Rex said Meekin walking loftily into the pitfall I do not read
private letters It was sealed and John Rex felt as if somebody had
withdrawn a match from a powder barrel

In a month Mr Meekin received a letter beautifully written from
Sarah Rex stating briefly that she had heard of his goodness that
the enclosed letter was for her husband and that if it was against the
rules to give it him she begged it might be returned to her unread Of
course Meekin gave it to Rex who next morning handed to Meekin a most
touching pious production begging him to read it Meekin did so and
any suspicions he may have had were at once disarmed He was ignorant of
the fact that the pious letter contained a private one intended for John
Rex only which letter John Rex thought so highly of that having read
it twice through most attentively he ate it

The plan of escape was after all a simple one Sarah Purfoy was to
obtain from Blicks the moneys he held in trust and to embark the sum
thus obtained in any business which would suffer her to keep a vessel
hovering round the southern coast of Van Diemens Land without exciting
suspicion The escape was to be made in the winter months if possible
in June or July The watchful vessel was to be commanded by some
trustworthy person who was to frequently land on the southeastern
side and keep a lookout for any extraordinary appearance along the
coast Rex himself must be left to run the gauntlet of the dogs and
guards unaided This seems a desperate scheme wrote Rex but it
is not so wild as it looks I have thought over a dozen others and
rejected them all This is the only way Consider it well I have my own
plan for escape which is easy if rescue be at hand All depends upon
placing a trustworthy man in charge of the vessel You ought to know
a dozen such I will wait eighteen months to give you time to make all
arrangements The eighteen months had now nearly passed over and
the time for the desperate attempt drew near Faithful to his cruel
philosophy John Rex had provided scapegoats who by their vicarious
agonies should assist him to his salvation

He had discovered that of the twenty men in his gang eight had already
determined on an effort for freedom The names of these eight were
Gabbett Vetch Bodenham Cornelius Greenhill Sanders called the
Moocher Cox and Travers The leading spirits were Vetch and Gabbett
who with profound reverence requested the Dandy to join John Rex
ever suspicious and feeling repelled by the giants strange eagerness
at first refused but by degrees allowed himself to appear to be
drawn into the scheme He would urge these men to their fate and take
advantage of the excitement attendant on their absence to effect his
own escape While all the island is looking for these eight boobies I
shall have a good chance to slip away unmissed He wished however to
have a companion Some strong man who if pressed hard would turn
and keep the pursuers at bay would be useful without doubt and this
comradevictim he sought in Rufus Dawes

Beginning as we have seen from a purely selfish motive to urge his
fellowprisoner to abscond with him John Rex gradually found himself
attracted into something like friendliness by the sternness with which
his overtures were repelled Always a keen student of human nature
the scoundrel saw beneath the roughness with which it had pleased the
unfortunate man to shroud his agony how faithful a friend and how
ardent and undaunted a spirit was concealed There was moreover a
mystery about Rufus Dawes which Rex the reader of hearts longed to
fathom

Have you no friends whom you would wish to see he asked one evening
when Rufus Dawes had proved more than usually deaf to his arguments

No said Dawes gloomily My friends are all dead to me

What all asked the other Most men have some one whom they wish to
see

Rufus Dawes laughed a slow heavy laugh I am better here

Then are you content to live this dogs life

Enough enough said Dawes I am resolved

Pooh Pluck up a spirit cried Rex It cant fail Ive been thinking
of it for eighteen months and it cant fail

Who are going asked the other his eyes fixed on the ground John Rex
enumerated the eight and Dawes raised his head I wont go I have
had two trials at it I dont want another I would advise you not to
attempt it either

Why not

Gabbett bolted twice before said Rufus Dawes shuddering at the
remembrance of the ghastly object he had seen in the sunlit glen at
Hells Gates Others went with him but each time he returned alone

What do you mean asked Rex struck by the tone of his companion

What became of the others

Died I suppose said the Dandy with a forced laugh

Yes but how They were all without food How came the surviving
monster to live six weeks

John Rex grew a shade paler and did not reply He recollected the
sanguinary legend that pertained to Gabbetts rescue But he did not
intend to make the journey in his company so after all he had no
cause for fear Come with me then he said at length We will try
our luck together

No I have resolved I stay here

And leave your innocence unproved

How can I prove it cried Rufus Dawes roughly impatient There are
crimes committed which are never brought to light and this is one of
them

Well said Rex rising as if weary of the discussion have it your
own way then You know best The private detective game is hard work
I myself have gone on a wildgoose chase before now Theres a mystery
about a certain shipbuilders son which took me four months to unravel
and then I lost the thread

A shipbuilders son Who was he

John Rex paused in wonderment at the eager interest with which the
question was put and then hastened to take advantage of this new
opening for conversation A queer story A wellknown character in my
timeSir Richard Devine A miserly old curmudgeon with a scapegrace
son

Rufus Dawes bit his lips to avoid showing his emotion This was the
second time that the name of his dead father had been spoken in his
hearing I think I remember something of him he said with a voice
that sounded strangely calm in his own ears

A curious story said Rex plunging into past memories Amongst other
matters I dabbled a little in the Private Inquiry line of business and
the old man came to me He had a son who had gone abroada wild young
dog by all accountsand he wanted particulars of him

Did you get them

To a certain extent I hunted him through Paris into Brussels from
Brussels to Antwerp from Antwerp back to Paris I lost him there
A miserable end to a long and expensive search I got nothing but
a portmanteau with a lot of letters from his mother I sent the
particulars to the shipbuilder and by all accounts the news killed
him for he died not long after

And the son

Came to the queerest end of all The old man had left him his
fortunea large one I believebut hed left Europe it seems for
India and was lost in the Hydaspes Frere was his cousin

Ah

By Gad it annoys me when I think of it continued Rex feeling
by force of memory once more the adventurer of fashion With the
resources I had too Oh a miserable failure The days and nights Ive
spent walking about looking for Richard Devine and never catching
a glimpse of him The old man gave me his sons portrait with full
particulars of his early life and I suppose I carried that ivory
gimcrack in my breast for nearly three months pulling it out to refresh
my memory every halfhour By Gad if the young gentleman was
anything like his picture I could have sworn to him if Id met him in
Timbuctoo

Do you think youd know him again asked Rufus Dawes in a low voice
turning away his head

There may have been something in the attitude in which the speaker had
put himself that awakened memory or perhaps the subdued eagerness of
the tone contrasting so strangely with the comparative inconsequence of
the theme that caused John Rexs brain to perform one of those feats
of automatic synthesis at which we afterwards wonder The profligate
sonthe likeness to the portraitthe mystery of Dawess life These
were the links of a galvanic chain He closed the circuit and a vivid
flash revealed to himTHE MAN

Warder Troke coming up put his hand on Rexs shoulder Dawes he
said youre wanted at the yard and then seeing his mistake added
with a grin Curse you two youre so much alike one cant tell tother
from which

Rufus Dawes walked off moodily but John Rexs evil face turned pale
and a strange hope made his heart leap Gad Trokes right we are
alike Ill not press him to escape any more




CHAPTER XXIII RUNNING THE GAUNTLET



The Pretty Maryas ugly and evilsmelling a tub as ever pitched under
a southerly bursterhad been lying on and off Cape Surville for nearly
three weeks Captain Blunt was getting wearied He made strenuous
efforts to find the oysterbeds of which he was ostensibly in search
but no success attended his efforts In vain did he take boat and pull
into every cove and nook between the Hippolyte Reef and Schoutens
Island In vain did he run the Pretty Mary as near to the rugged cliffs
as he dared to take her and make perpetual expeditions to the shore In
vain did hein his eagerness for the interests of Mrs Purfoyclamber
up the rocks and spend hours in solitary soundings in Blackmans Bay
He never found an oyster If I dont find something in three or four
days more said he to his mate I shall go back again Its too
dangerous cruising here


     


On the same evening that Captain Blunt made this resolution the
watchman at Signal Hill saw the arms of the semaphore at the settlement
make three motions thus

The semaphore was furnished with three revolving arms fixed one above
the other The upper one denoted units and had six motions indicating
ONE to SIX The middle one denoted tens TEN to SIXTY The lower one
marked hundreds from ONE HUNDRED to SIX HUNDRED

The lower and upper arms whirled out That meant THREE HUNDRED AND SIX
A ball ran up to the top of the post That meant ONE THOUSAND

Number 1306 or being interpreted PRISONERS ABSCONDED

By George Harry said Jones the signalman theres a bolt

The semaphore signalled again Number 1411

WITH ARMS Jones said translating as he read Come here Harry
heres a go

But Harry did not reply and looking down the watchman saw a dark
figure suddenly fill the doorway The boasted semaphore had failed this
time at all events The bolters had arrived as soon as the signal

The man sprang at his carbine but the intruder had already possessed
himself of it Its no use making a fuss Jones There are eight of us
Oblige me by attending to your signals

Jones knew the voice It was that of John Rex Reply cant you said
Rex coolly Captain Burgess is in a hurry The arms of the semaphore
at the settlement were in fact gesticulating with comical vehemence

Jones took the strings in his hands and with his signalbook open
before him was about to acknowledge the message when Rex stopped him
Send this message he said NOT SEEN SIGNAL SENT TO EAGLEHAWK

Jones paused irresolutely He was himself a convict and dreaded the
inevitable cat that he knew would follow this false message If they
finds me out he said Rex cocked the carbine with so decided a
meaning in his black eyes that Joneswho could be brave enough on
occasionsbanished his hesitation at once and began to signal eagerly
There came up a clinking of metal and a murmur from below Whats
keepin yer Dandy

All right Get those irons off and then well talk boys Im putting
salt on old Burgesss tail The rough jest was received with a roar
and Jones looking momentarily down from his window on the staging saw
in the waning light a group of men freeing themselves from their irons
with a hammer taken from the guardhouse while two already freed were
casting buckets of water on the beacon woodpile The sentry was lying
bound at a little distance

Now said the leader of this surprise party signal to Woody Island
Jones perforce obeyed Say AN ESCAPE AT THE MINES WATCH ONETREE
POINT SEND ON TO EAGLEHAWK Quick now

Jonescomprehending at once the force of this manoeuvre which would
have the effect of distracting attention from the Neckexecuted the
order with a grin Youre a knowing one Dandy Jack said he

John Rex acknowledged the compliment by uncocking the carbine Hold
out your handsJemmy Vetch Ay ay replied the Crow from beneath
Come up and tie our friend Jones Gabbett have you got the axes
Theres only one said Gabbett with an oath Then bring that and
any tucker you can lay your hands on Have you tied him On we go then
And in the space of five minutes from the time when unsuspecting Harry
had been silently clutched by two forms who rushed upon him out of the
shadows of the huts the Signal Hill Station was deserted

At the settlement Burgess was foaming Nine men to seize the Long
Bay boat and get half an hours start of the alarm signal was an
unprecedented achievement What could Warder Troke have been about
Warder Troke however found eight hours afterwards disarmed gagged
and bound in the scrub had been guilty of no negligence How could
he tell that at a certain signal from Dandy Jack the nine men he had
taken to Stewarts Bay would rush him and before he could draw a
pistol truss him like a chicken The worst of the gang Rufus Dawes
had volunteered for the hated duties of piledriving and Troke had felt
himself secure How could he possibly guess that there was a plot in
which Rufus Dawes of all men had refused to join

Constables mounted and on foot were despatched to scour the bush round
the settlement Burgess confident from the reply of the Signal Hill
semaphore that the alarm had been given at Eaglehawk Isthmus promised
himself the recapture of the gang before many hours and giving
orders to keep the communications going retired to dinner His convict
servants had barely removed the soup when the result of John Rexs
ingenuity became manifest

The semaphore at Signal Hill had stopped working

Perhaps the fools cant see said Burgess Fire the beaconand
saddle my horse The beacon was fired All right at Mount Arthur Mount
Communication and the Coal Mines To the westward the line was clear
But at Signal Hill was no answering light Burgess stamped with rage
Get me my boats crew ready and tell the Mines to signal to Woody
Island As he stood on the jetty a breathless messenger brought
the reply A BOATS CREW GONE TO ONETREE POINT FIVE MEN SENT FROM
EAGLEHAWK IN OBEDIENCE TO ORDERS Burgess understood it at once The
fellows had decoyed the Eaglehawk guard Give way men And the boat
shooting into the darkness made for Long Bay I wont be far behind
em said the Commandant at any rate



Between Eaglehawk and Signal Hill were for the absconders other
dangers Along the indented coast of Port Bunche were four constables
stations These stationsmere huts within signalling distance of each
otherfringed the shore and to avoid them it would be necessary to
make a circuit into the scrub Unwilling as he was to lose time John
Rex saw that to attempt to run the gauntlet of these four stations would
be destruction The safety of the party depended upon the reaching of
the Neck while the guard was weakened by the absence of some of the men
along the southern shore and before the alarm could be given from
the eastern arm of the peninsula With this view he ranged his men in
single file and quitting the road near Norfolk Bay made straight for
the Neck The night had set in with a high westerly wind and threatened
rain It was pitch dark and the fugitives were guided only by the dull
roar of the sea as it beat upon Descent Beach Had it not been for
the accident of a westerly gale they would not have had even so much
assistance

The Crow walked first as guide carrying a musket taken from Harry
Then came Gabbett with an axe followed by the other six sharing
between them such provisions as they had obtained at Signal Hill John
Rex with the carbine and Trokes pistols walked last It had been
agreed that if attacked they were to run each one his own way In their
desperate case disunion was strength At intervals on their left
gleamed the lights of the constables stations and as they stumbled
onward they heard plainer and more plainly the hoarse murmur of the sea
beyond which was liberty or death

After nearly two hours of painful progress Jemmy Vetch stopped and
whispered them to approach They were on a sandy rise To the left was a
black objecta constables hut to the right was a dim white linethe
ocean in front was a row of lamps and between every two lamps leapt
and ran a dusky indistinct body Jemmy Vetch pointed with his lean
forefinger

The dogs

Instinctively they crouched down lest even at that distance the two
sentries so plainly visible in the red light of the guardhouse fire
should see them

Well bos said Gabbett whats to be done now

As he spoke a long low howl broke from one of the chained hounds and
the whole kennel burst into hideous outcry John Rex who perhaps was
the bravest of the party shuddered They have smelt us he said We
must go on

Gabbett spat in his palm and took firmer hold of the axehandle

Right you are he said Ill leave my mark on some of them before
this nights out

On the opposite shore lights began to move and the fugitives could hear
the hurrying tramp of feet

Make for the righthand side of the jetty said Rex in a fierce
whisper I think I see a boat there It is our only chance now We can
never break through the station Are we ready Now All together

Gabbett was fast outstripping the others by some three feet of distance
There were eleven dogs two of whom were placed on stages set out in the
water and they were so chained that their muzzles nearly touched The
giant leapt into the line and with a blow of his axe split the skull of
the beast on his right hand This action unluckily took him within reach
of the other dog which seized him by the thigh

Fire cried McNab from the other side of the lamps

The giant uttered a cry of rage and pain and fell with the dog
under him It was however the dog who had pulled him down and the
musketball intended for him struck Travers in the jaw The unhappy
villain felllike Virgils Daresspitting blood teeth and curses

Gabbett clutched the mastiffs throat with iron hand and forced him
to loose his hold then bellowing with fury seized his axe and sprang
forward mangled as he was upon the nearest soldier Jemmy Vetch had
been beforehand with him Uttering a low snarl of hate he fired and
shot the sentry through the breast The others rushed through the now
broken cordon and made headlong for the boat

Fools cried Rex behind them You have wasted a shot LOOK TO YOUR
LEFT

Burgess hurried down the tramroad by his men had tarried at Signal
Hill only long enough to loose the surprised guard from their bonds and
taking the Woody Island boat was pulling with a fresh crew to the Neck
The reinforcement was not ten yards from the jetty

The Crow saw the danger and flinging himself into the water
desperately seized McNabs boat

In with you for your lives he cried Another volley from the guard
spattered the water around the fugitives but in the darkness the
illaimed bullets fell harmless Gabbett swung himself over the sheets
and seized an oar

Cox Bodenham Greenhill Now push her off Jump Tom jump and as
Burgess leapt to land Cornelius was dragged over the stern and the
whaleboat floated into deep water

McNab seeing this ran down to the waterside to aid the Commandant

Lift her over the Bar men he shouted With a willSo And raised
in twelve strong arms the pursuing craft slid across the isthmus

Weve five minutes start said Vetch coolly as he saw the Commandant
take his place in the stern sheets Pull away my jolly boys and well
best em yet

The soldiers on the Neck fired again almost at random but the blaze of
their pieces only served to show the Commandants boat a hundred yards
astern of that of the mutineers which had already gained the deep water
of Pirates Bay

Then for the first time the six prisoners became aware that John Rex
was not among them




CHAPTER XXIV IN THE NIGHT



John Rex had put into execution the first part of his scheme

At the moment when seeing Burgesss boat near the sandspit he
had uttered the warning cry heard by Vetch he turned back into the
darkness and made for the waters edge at a point some distance from
the Neck His desperate hope was that the attention of the guard being
concentrated on the escaping boat he might favoured by the darkness
and the confusionswim to the peninsula It was not a very marvellous
feat to accomplish and he had confidence in his own powers Once
safe on the peninsula his plans were formed But owing to the strong
westerly wind which caused an incoming tide upon the isthmus it was
necessary for him to attain some point sufficiently far to the southward
to enable him on taking the water to be assisted not impeded by
the current With this view he hurried over the sandy hummocks at
the entrance to the Neck and ran backwards towards the sea In a few
strides he had gained the hard and sandy shore and pausing to listen
heard behind him the sound of footsteps He was pursued The footsteps
stopped and then a voice cried

Surrender

It was McNab who seeing Rexs retreat had daringly followed him John
Rex drew from his breast Trokes pistol and waited

Surrender cried the voice again and the footsteps advanced two
paces

At the instant that Rex raised the weapon to fire a vivid flash of
lightning showed him on his right hand on the ghastly and pallid
ocean two boats the hindermost one apparently within a few yards of
him The men looked like corpses In the distance rose Cape Surville
and beneath Cape Surville was the hungry sea The scene vanished in an
instantswallowed up almost before he had realized it But the shock
it gave him made him miss his aim and flinging away the pistol with a
curse he turned down the path and fled McNab followed

The path had been made by frequent passage from the station and Rex
found it tolerably easy running He had acquiredlike most men who live
much in the darkthat catlike perception of obstacles which is due
rather to increased sensitiveness of touch than increased acuteness
of vision His feet accommodated themselves to the inequalities of the
ground his hands instinctively outstretched themselves towards the
overhanging boughs his head ducked of its own accord to any obtrusive
sapling which bent to obstruct his progress His pursuer was not so
fortunate Twice did John Rex laugh mentally at a crash and scramble
that told of a fall and oncein a valley where trickled a little
stream that he had cleared almost without an efforthe heard a splash
that made him laugh outright The track now began to go uphill and Rex
redoubled his efforts trusting to his superior muscular energy to
shake off his pursuer He breasted the rise and paused to listen The
crashing of branches behind him had ceased and it seemed that he was
alone

He had gained the summit of the cliff The lights of the Neck were
invisible Below him lay the sea Out of the black emptiness came puffs
of sharp salt wind The tops of the rollers that broke below were
blown off and whirled away into the nightwhite patches swallowed up
immediately in the increasing darkness From the north side of the bay
was borne the hoarse roar of the breakers as they dashed against the
perpendicular cliffs which guarded Forrestiers Peninsula At his
feet arose a frightful shrieking and whistling broken at intervals by
reports like claps of thunder Where was he Exhausted and breathless
he sank down into the rough scrub and listened All at once on the
track over which he had passed he heard a sound that made him bound to
his feet in deadly fearthe bay of a dog

He thrust his hand to his breast for the remaining pistol and uttered a
cry of alarm He had dropped it He felt round about him in the darkness
for some stick or stone that might serve as a weapon In vain His
fingers clutched nothing but prickly scrub and coarse grass The sweat
ran down his face With staring eyeballs and bristling hair he stared
into the darkness as if he would dissipate it by the very intensity of
his gaze The noise was repeated and piercing through the roar of wind
and water above and below him seemed to be close at hand He heard a
mans voice cheering the dog in accents that the gale blew away from
him before he could recognize them It was probable that some of the
soldiers had been sent to the assistance of McNab Capture then
was certain In his agony the wretched man almost promised himself
repentance should he escape this peril The dog crashing through the
underwood gave one short sharp howl and then ran mute

The darkness had increased the gale The wind ravaging the hollow
heaven had spread between the lightnings and the sea an impenetrable
curtain of black cloud It seemed possible to seize upon this curtain
and draw its edge yet closer so dense was it The white and raging
waters were blotted out and even the lightning seemed unable to
penetrate that intense blackness A large warm drop of rain fell upon
Rexs outstretched hand and far overhead rumbled a wrathful peal of
thunder The shrieking which he had heard a few moments ago had ceased
but every now and then dull but immense shocks as of some mighty bird
flapping the cliff with monstrous wings reverberated around him and
shook the ground where he stood He looked towards the ocean and a
tall misty Formwhite against the allpervading blacknessbeckoned
and bowed to him He saw it distinctly for an instant and then with
an awful shriek as of wrathful despair it sank and vanished Maddened
with a terror he could not define the hunted man turned to meet the
material peril that was so close at hand

With a ferocious gasp the dog flung himself upon him John Rex was
borne backwards but in his desperation he clutched the beast by the
throat and belly and exerting all his strength flung him off The
brute uttered one howl and seemed to lie where he had fallen while
above his carcase again hovered that white and vaporous column It was
strange that McNab and the soldier did not follow up the advantage they
had gained Courageperhaps he should defeat them yet He had been
lucky to dispose of the dog so easily With a fierce thrill of renewed
hope he ran forward when at his feet in his face arose that misty
Form breathing chill warning as though to wave him back The terror at
his heels drove him on A few steps more and he should gain the summit
of the cliff He could feel the sea roaring in front of him in the
gloom The column disappeared and in a lull of wind uprose from the
place where it had been such a hideous medley of shrieks laughter and
exultant wrath that John Rex paused in horror Too late The ground
gave wayit seemedbeneath his feet He was fallingclutching in
vain at rocks shrubs and grass The cloudcurtain lifted and by
the lightning that leaped and played about the ocean John Rex found an
explanation of his terrors more terrible than they themselves had been
The track he had followed led to that portion of the cliff in which the
sea had excavated the tunnelspout known as the Devils Blowhole

Clinging to a tree that growing halfway down the precipice had
arrested his course he stared into the abyss Before himalready high
above his headwas a gigantic arch of cliff Through this arch he saw
at an immense distance below him the raging and pallid ocean Beneath
him was an abyss splintered with black rocks turbid and raucous with
tortured water Suddenly the bottom of this abyss seemed to advance to
meet him or rather the black throat of the chasm belched a volume of
leaping curling water which mounted to drown him Was it fancy that
showed him on the surface of the rising column the mangled carcase of
the dog

The chasm into which John Rex had fallen was shaped like a huge funnel
set up on its narrow end The sides of this funnel were rugged rock and
in the banks of earth lodged here and there upon projections a scrubby
vegetation grew The scanty growth paused abruptly halfway down the
gulf and the rock below was perpetually damp from the upthrown
spray Accidenthad the convict been a Meekin we might term it
Providencehad lodged him on the lowest of these banks of earth In
calm weather he would have been out of danger but the lightning flash
revealed to his terrorsharpened sense a black patch of dripping rock on
the side of the chasm some ten feet above his head It was evident that
upon the next rising of the waterspout the place where he stood would
be covered with water

The roaring column mounted with hideous swiftness Rex felt it rush at
him and swing him upward With both arms round the tree he clutched the
sleeves of his jacket with either hand Perhaps if he could maintain his
hold he might outlive the shock of that suffocating torrent He felt
his feet rudely seized as though by the hand of a giant and plucked
upwards Water gurgled in his ears His arms seemed about to be torn
from their sockets Had the strain lasted another instant he must have
loosed his hold but with a wild hoarse shriek as though it was some
seamonster baffled of its prey the column sank and left him gasping
bleeding halfdrowned but alive It was impossible that he could
survive another shock and in his agony he unclasped his stiffened
fingers determined to resign himself to his fate At that instant
however he saw on the wall of rock that hollowed on his right hand a
red and lurid light in the midst of which fantastically bobbed hither
and thither the gigantic shadow of a man He cast his eyes upwards and
saw slowly descending into the gulf a blazing bush tied to a rope
McNab was taking advantage of the pause in the spouting to examine the
sides of the Blowhole

A despairing hope seized John Rex In another instant the light would
reveal his figure clinging like a limpet to the rock to those above
He must be detected in any case but if they could lower the rope
sufficiently he might clutch it and be saved His dread of the horrible
death that was beneath him overcame his resolution to avoid recapture
The longdrawn agony of the retreating water as it was sucked back
again into the throat of the chasm had ceased and he knew that the next
tremendous pulsation of the sea below would hurl the spuming destruction
up upon him The gigantic torch slowly descended and he had already
drawn in his breath for a shout which should make itself heard above the
roar of the wind and water when a strange appearance on the face of the
cliff made him pause About six feet from himglowing like molten gold
in the gusty glow of the burning treea round sleek stream of water
slipped from the rock into the darkness like a serpent from its hole
Above this stream a dark spot defied the torchlight and John Rex felt
his heart leap with one last desperate hope as he comprehended that
close to him was one of those tortuous drives which the wormlike action
of the sea bores in such caverns as that in which he found himself The
drive opened first to the light of the day by the natural convulsion
which had raised the mountain itself above ocean level probably
extended into the bowels of the cliff The stream ceased to let itself
out of the crevice it was then likely that the rising column of water
did not penetrate far into this wonderful hidingplace

Endowed with a wisdom which in one placed in less desperate position
would have been madness John Rex shouted to his pursuers The rope
the rope The words projected against the sides of the enormous
funnel were pitched high above the blast and reduplicated by a
thousand echoes reached the ears of those above

Hes alive cried McNab peering into the abyss I see him Look

The soldier whipped the end of the bullockhide lariat round the tree to
which he held and began to oscillate it so that the blazing bush might
reach the ledge on which the daring convict sustained himself The groan
which preceded the fierce belching forth of the torrent was cast up to
them from below

God be gude to the puir felly said the pious young Scotchman
catching his breath

A white spume was visible at the bottom of the gulf and the groan
changed into a rapidly increasing bellow John Rex eyeing the blazing
pendulum that with longer and longer swing momentarily neared him
looked up to the black heaven for the last time with a muttered prayer
The bushthe flame fanned by the motionflung a crimson glow upon his
frowning features which as he caught the rope had a sneer of triumph
on them Slack out slack out he cried and then drawing the burning
bush towards him attempted to stamp out the fire with his feet

The soldier set his body against the tree trunk and gripped the rope
hard turning his head away from the fiery pit below him Hold tight
your honour he muttered to McNab Shes coming

The bellow changed into a roar the roar into a shriek and with a gust
of wind and spray the seething sea leapt up out of the gulf John Rex
unable to extinguish the flame twisted his arm about the rope and the
instant before the surface of the rising water made a momentary floor to
the mouth of the cavern he spurned the cliff desperately with his feet
and flung himself across the chasm He had already clutched the rock
and thrust himself forward when the tremendous volume of water struck
him McNab and the soldier felt the sudden pluck of the rope and saw the
light swing across the abyss Then the fury of the waterspout burst with
a triumphant scream the tension ceased the light was blotted out and
when the column sank there dangled at the end of the lariat nothing
but the drenched and blackened skeleton of the sheoak bough Amid a
terrific peal of thunder the long pentup rain descended and a sudden
ghastly rending asunder of the clouds showed far below them the heaving
ocean high above them the jagged and glistening rocks and at their
feet the black and murderous abyss of the Blowholeempty

They pulled up the useless rope in silence and another dead tree
lighted and lowered showed them nothing

God rest his puir soul said McNab shuddering Hes out o our hans
now




CHAPTER XXV THE FLIGHT


Gabbett guided by the Crow had determined to beach the captured boat
on the southern point of Cape Surville It will be seen by those who
have followed the description of the topography of Colonel Arthurs
Penitentiary that nothing but the desperate nature of the attempt could
have justified so desperate a measure The perpendicular cliffs seemed
to render such an attempt certain destruction but Vetch who had been
employed in building the pier at the Neck knew that on the southern
point of the promontory was a strip of beach upon which the company
might by good fortune land in safety With something of the decision
of his leader Rex the Crow determined at once that in their desperate
plight this was the only measure and setting his teeth as he seized
the oar that served as a rudder he put the boats head straight for the
huge rock that formed the northern horn of Pirates Bay

Save for the faint phosphorescent radiance of the foaming waves the
darkness was intense and Burgess for some minutes pulled almost at
random in pursuit The same tremendous flash of lightning which had
saved the life of McNab by causing Rex to miss his aim showed to the
Commandant the whaleboat balanced on the summit of an enormous
wave and apparently about to be flung against the wall of rock
whichmagnified in the flashseemed frightfully near to them The
next instant Burgess himselfhis boat lifted by the swiftly advancing
billowsaw a wild waste of raging seas scooped into abysmal troughs
in which the bulk of a leviathan might wallow At the bottom of one
of these valleys of water lay the mutineers boat looking with its
outspread oars like some sixlegged insect floating in a pool of ink
The great cliff whose every scar and crag was as distinct as though
its huge bulk was but a yard distant seemed to shoot out from its base
towards the struggling insect a broad flat straw that was a strip of
dry land The next instant the rushing water carrying the sixlegged
atom with it creamed up over this strip of beach the giant crag amid
the thundercrash which followed upon the lightning appeared to stoop
down over the ocean and as it stooped the billow rolled onwards
the boat glided down into the depths and the whole phantasmagoria was
swallowed up in the tumultuous darkness of the tempest

Burgesshis hair bristling with terrorshouted to put the boat about
but he might with as much reason have shouted at an avalanche The wind
blew his voice away and emptied it violently into the air A snarling
billow jerked the oar from his hand Despite the desperate efforts of
the soldiers the boat was whirled up the mountain of water like a
leaf on a waterspout and a second flash of lightning showed them
what seemed a group of dolls struggling in the surf and a walnutshell
bottom upwards was driven by the recoil of the waves towards them For
an instant all thought that they must share the fate which had overtaken
the unlucky convicts but Burgess succeeded in trimming the boat and
awed by the peril he had so narrowly escaped gave the order to return
As the men set the boats head to the welcome line of lights that marked
the Neck a black spot balanced upon a black line was swept under their
stern and carried out to sea As it passed them this black spot emitted
a cry and they knew that it was one of the shattered boats crew
clinging to an oar

He was the only one of em alive said Burgess bandaging his sprained
wrist two hours afterwards at the Neck and hes food for the fishes by
this time



He was mistaken however Fate had in reserve for the crew of villains
a less merciful death than that of drowning Aided by the lightning
and that wonderful good luck which urges villainy to its destruction
Vetch beached the boat and the party bruised and bleeding reached the
upper portion of the shore in safety Of all this number only Cox was
lost He was pulling strokeoar and being something of a laggard
stood in the way of the Crow who seeing the importance of haste in
preserving his own skin plucked the man backwards by the collar and
passed over his sprawling body to the shore Cox grasping at anything
to save himself clutched an oar and the next moment found himself
borne out with the overturned whaleboat by the undertow He was
drifted past his only hope of rescuethe guardboatwith a velocity
that forbade all attempts at rescue and almost before the poor
scoundrel had time to realize his condition he was in the best possible
way of escaping the hanging that his comrades had so often humorously
prophesied for him Being a strong and vigorous villain however he
clung tenaciously to his oar and even unbuckling his leather belt
passed it round the slip of wood that was his salvation girding himself
to it as firmly as he was able In this condition plus a swoon from
exhaustion he was descried by the helmsman of the Pretty Mary a few
miles from Cape Surville at daylight next morning Blunt with a wild
hope that this waif and stray might be the lover of Sarah Purfoy dead
lowered a boat and picked him up Nearly bisected by the belt gorged
with salt water frozen with cold and having two ribs broken the
victim of Vetchs murderous quickness retained sufficient life to
survive Blunts remedies for nearly two hours During that time he
stated that his name was Cox that he had escaped from Port Arthur with
eight others that John Rex was the leader of the expedition that the
others were all drowned and that he believed John Rex had been retaken
Having placed Blunt in possession of these particulars he further said
that it pricked him to breathe cursed Jemmy Vetch the settlement and
the sea and so impenitently died Blunt smoked three pipes and then
altered the course of the Pretty Mary two points to the eastward
and ran for the coast It was possible that the man for whom he was
searching had not been retaken and was even now awaiting his arrival
It was clearly his dutyhearing of the planned escape having been
actually attemptednot to give up the expedition while hope remained

Ill take one more look along said he to himself

The Pretty Mary hugging the coast as closely as she dared crawled in
the thin breeze all day and saw nothing It would be madness to land at
Cape Surville for the whole station would be on the alert so Blunt as
night was falling stood off a little across the mouth of Pirates Bay
He was walking the deck groaning at the folly of the expedition when
a strange appearance on the southern horn of the bay made him come to a
sudden halt There was a furnace blazing in the bowels of the mountain
Blunt rubbed his eyes and stared He looked at the man at the helm Do
you see anything yonder Jem

Jema Sydney man who had never been round that coast beforebriefly
remarked Lighthouse

Blunt stumped into the cabin and got out his charts No lighthouse was
laid down there only a mark like an anchor and a note Remarkable
Hole at this Point A remarkable hole indeed a remarkable lime kiln
would have been more to the purpose

Blunt called up his mate William Staples a fellow whom Sarah Purfoys
gold had bought body and soul William Staples looked at the waxing and
waning glow for a while and then said in tones trembling with greed
Its a fire Lie to and lower away the jollyboat Old man thats our
bird for a thousand pounds

The Pretty Mary shortened sail and Blunt and Staples got into the
jollyboat

Goin ahoysterin sir said one of the crew with a grin as Blunt
threw a bundle into the sternsheets

Staples thrust his tongue into his cheek The object of the voyage was
now pretty well understood among the carefully picked crew Blunt had
not chosen men who were likely to betray him though for that
matter Rex had suggested a precaution which rendered betrayal almost
impossible

Whats in the bundle old man asked Will Staples after they had got
clear of the ship

Clothes returned Blunt We cant bring him off if it is him in his
canaries He puts on these duds dye see sinks Her Majestys livery
and comes aboard a shipwrecked mariner

Thats well thought of Whose notions that The Madams Ill be
bound

Ay

Shes a knowing one

And the sinister laughter of the pair floated across the violet water

Go easy man said Blunt as they neared the shore Theyre all awake
at Eaglehawk and if those cursed dogs give tongue therell be a boat
out in a twinkling Its lucky the winds off shore

Staples lay on his oar and listened The night was moonless and the
ship had already disappeared from view They were approaching the
promontory from the southeast and this isthmus of the guarded Neck was
hidden by the outlying cliff In the southwestern angle of this cliff
about midway between the summit and the sea was an arch which vomited
a red and flickering light that faintly shone upon the sea in the track
of the boat The light was lambent and uncertain now sinking almost
into insignificance and now leaping up with a fierceness that caused a
deep glow to throb in the very heart of the mountain Sometimes a black
figure would pass across this gigantic furnacemouth stooping and
rising as though feeding the fire One might have imagined that a door
in Vulcans Smithy had been left inadvertently open and that the old
hero was forging arms for a demigod

Blunt turned pale Its no mortal he whispered Lets go back

And what will Madam say returned daredevil Will Staples who would
have plunged into Mount Erebus had he been paid for it Thus appealed to
in the name of his ruling passion Blunt turned his head and the boat
sped onward




CHAPTER XXVI THE WORK OF THE SEA



The lift of the waterspout had saved John Rexs life At the moment
when it struck him he was on his hands and knees at the entrance of the
cavern The wave gushing upwards at the same time expanded laterally
and this lateral force drove the convict into the mouth of the
subterranean passage The passage trended downwards and for some
seconds he was rolled over and over the rush of water wedging him at
length into a crevice between two enormous stones which overhung a
still more formidable abyss Fortunately for the preservation of his
hardfoughtfor life this very fury of incoming water prevented him
from being washed out again with the recoil of the wave He could hear
the water dashing with frightful echoes far down into the depths beyond
him but it was evident that the two stones against which he had been
thrust acted as breakwaters to the torrent poured in from the outside
and repelled the main body of the stream in the fashion he had observed
from his position on the ledge In a few seconds the cavern was empty

Painfully extricating himself and feeling as yet doubtful of his
safety John Rex essayed to climb the twinblocks that barred the
unknown depths below him The first movement he made caused him to
shriek aloud His left armwith which he clung to the ropehung
powerless Ground against the ragged entrance it was momentarily
paralysed For an instant the unfortunate wretch sank despairingly on
the wet and rugged floor of the cave then a terrible gurgling beneath
his feet warned him of the approaching torrent and collecting all his
energies he scrambled up the incline Though nigh fainting with pain
and exhaustion he pressed desperately higher and higher He heard the
hideous shriek of the whirlpool which was beneath him grow louder
and louder He saw the darkness grow darker as the rising waterspout
covered the mouth of the cave He felt the salt spray sting his face
and the wrathful tide lick the hand that hung over the shelf on which he
fell But that was all He was out of danger at last And as the thought
blessed his senses his eyes closed and the wonderful courage and
strength which had sustained the villain so long exhaled in stupor

When he awoke the cavern was filled with the soft light of dawn Raising
his eyes he beheld high above his head a roof of rock on which the
reflection of the sunbeams playing upwards through a pool of water
cast flickering colours On his right hand was the mouth of the cave on
his left a terrific abyss at the bottom of which he could hear the
sea faintly lapping and washing He raised himself and stretched his
stiffened limbs Despite his injured shoulder it was imperative that he
should bestir himself He knew not if his escape had been noticed or
if the cavern had another inlet by which McNab returning might
penetrate Moreover he was wet and famished To preserve the life which
he had torn from the sea he must have fire and food First he examined
the crevice by which he had entered It was shaped like an irregular
triangle hollowed at the base by the action of the water which in such
storms as that of the preceding night was forced into it by the rising
of the sea John Rex dared not crawl too near the edge lest he should
slide out of the damp and slippery orifice and be dashed upon the
rocks at the bottom of the Blowhole Craning his neck he could see a
hundred feet below him the sullenly frothing water gurgling spouting
and creaming in huge turbid eddies occasionally leaping upwards as
though it longed for another storm to send it raging up to the man who
had escaped its fury It was impossible to get down that way He turned
back into the cavern and began to explore in that direction The
twinrocks against which he had been hurled were in fact pillars which
supported the roof of the waterdrive Beyond them lay a great grey
shadow which was emptiness faintly illumined by the sealight cast up
through the bottom of the gulf Midway across the grey shadow fell a
strange beam of dusky brilliance which cast its flickering light upon a
wilderness of waving seaweeds Even in the desperate position in which
he found himself there survived in the vagabonds nature sufficient
poetry to make him value the natural marvel upon which he had so
strangely stumbled The immense promontory which viewed from the
outside seemed as solid as a mountain was in reality but a hollow
cone reft and split into a thousand fissures by the unsuspected action
of the sea for centuries The Blowhole was but an insignificant cranny
compared with this enormous chasm Descending with difficulty the steep
incline he found himself on the brink of a gallery of rock which
jutting out over the pool bore on its moist and weedbearded edges
signs of frequent submersion It must be low tide without the rock
Clinging to the rough and rootlike algae that fringed the evermoist
walls John Rex crept round the projection of the gallery and passed at
once from dimness to daylight There was a broad loophole in the side
of the honeycombed and waveperforated cliff The cloudless heaven
expanded above him a fresh breeze kissed his cheek and sixty feet
below him the sea wrinkled all its lazy length sparkling in myriad
wavelets beneath the bright beams of morning Not a sign of the recent
tempest marred the exquisite harmony of the picture Not a sign of human
life gave evidence of the grim neighbourhood of the prison From the
recess out of which he peered nothing was visible but a sky of turquoise
smiling upon a sea of sapphire

The placidity of Nature was however to the hunted convict a new source
of alarm It was a reason why the Blowhole and its neighbourhood should
be thoroughly searched He guessed that the favourable weather would be
an additional inducement to McNab and Burgess to satisfy themselves
as to the fate of their late prisoner He turned from the opening and
prepared to descend still farther into the rock pathway The sunshine
had revived and cheered him and a sort of instinct told him that the
cliff so honeycombed above could not be without some gully or chink
at its base which at low tide would give upon the rocky shore It grew
darker as he descended and twice he almost turned back in dread of the
gulfs on either side of him It seemed to him also that the gullet of
weedclad rock through which he was crawling doubled upon itself
and led only into the bowels of the mountain Gnawed by hunger and
conscious that in a few hours at most the rising tide would fill the
subterranean passage and cut off his retreat he pushed desperately
onwards He had descended some ninety feet and had lost in the devious
windings of his downward path all but the reflection of the light from
the gallery when he was rewarded by a glimpse of sunshine striking
upwards He parted two enormous masses of seaweed whose bubbleheaded
fronds hung curtainwise across his path and found himself in the very
middle of the narrow cleft of rock through which the sea was driven to
the Blowhole

At an immense distance above him was the arch of cliff Beyond that
arch appeared a segment of the ragged edge of the circular opening
down which he had fallen He looked in vain for the funnelmouth whose
friendly shelter had received him It was now indistinguishable At his
feet was a long rift in the solid rock so narrow that he could almost
have leapt across it This rift was the channel of a swift black current
which ran from the sea for fifty yards under an arch eight feet high
until it broke upon the jagged rocks that lay blistering in the sunshine
at the bottom of the circular opening in the upper cliff A shudder
shook the limbs of the adventurous convict He comprehended that at
high tide the place where he stood was under water and that the narrow
cavern became a subaqueous pipe of solid rock forty feet long through
which were spouted the leaguelong rollers of the Southern Sea

The narrow strip of rock at the base of the cliff was as flat as
a table Here and there were enormous hollows like pans which the
retreating tide had left full of clear still water The crannies of
the rock were inhabited by small white crabs and John Rex found to his
delight that there was on this little shelf abundance of mussels
which though lean and acrid were sufficiently grateful to his famished
stomach Attached to the flat surfaces of the numerous stones moreover
were coarse limpets These however John Rex found too salt to be
palatable and was compelled to reject them A larger variety however
having a succulent body as thick as a mans thumb contained in long
razorshaped shells were in some degree free from this objection and
he soon collected the materials for a meal Having eaten and sunned
himself he began to examine the enormous rock to the base of which he
had so strangely penetrated Rugged and worn it raised its huge breast
against wind and wave secure upon a broad pedestal which probably
extended as far beneath the sea as the massive column itself rose above
it Rising thus with its shaggy drapery of seaweed clinging about its
knees it seemed to be a motionless but sentient beingsome monster of
the deep a Titan of the ocean condemned ever to front in silence the
fury of that illimitable and rarelytravelled sea Yetsilent and
motionless as he wasthe hoary ancient gave hint of the mysteries of
his revenge Standing upon the broad and seagirt platform where surely
no human foot but his had ever stood in life the convict saw many feet
above him pitched into a cavity of the huge sunblistered boulders an
object which his sailor eye told him at once was part of the top hamper
of some large ship Crusted with shells and its ruin so overrun with
the ivy of the ocean that its ropes could barely be distinguished from
the weeds with which they were encumbered this relic of human labour
attested the triumph of nature over human ingenuity Perforated below by
the relentless sea exposed above to the full fury of the tempest set
in solitary defiance to the waves that rolling from the icevolcano of
the Southern Pole hurled their gathered might unchecked upon its iron
front the great rock drew from its lonely warfare the materials of its
own silent vengeance Clasped in iron arms it held its prey snatched
from the jaws of the alldevouring sea One might imagine that when the
doomed ship with her crew of shrieking souls had splintered and gone
down the deaf blind giant had clutched this fragment upheaved from
the seething waters with a thrill of savage and terrible joy

John Rex gazing up at this memento of a forgotten agony felt a
sensation of the most vulgar pleasure Theres wood for my fire
thought he and mounting to the spot he essayed to fling down the
splinters of timber upon the platform Long exposed to the sun and
flung high above the watermark of recent storms the timber had dried
to the condition of touchwood and would burn fiercely It was precisely
what he required Strange accident that had for years stored upon a
desolate rock this fragment of a vanished and longforgotten vessel
that it might aid at last to warm the limbs of a villain escaping from
justice

Striking the disintegrated mass with his ironshod heel John Rex broke
off convenient portions and making a bag of his shirt by tying the
sleeves and neck he was speedily staggering into the cavern with a
supply of fuel He made two trips flinging down the wood on the floor
of the gallery that overlooked the sea and was returning for a third
when his quick ear caught the dip of oars He had barely time to lift
the seaweed curtain that veiled the entrance to the chasm when the
Eaglehawk boat rounded the promontory Burgess was in the sternsheets
and seemed to be making signals to someone on the top of the cliff Rex
grinning behind his veil divined the manoeuvre McNab and his party
were to search above while the Commandant examined the gulf below
The boat headed direct for the passage and for an instant John Rexs
undaunted soul shivered at the thought that perhaps after all his
pursuers might be aware of the existence of the cavern Yet that was
unlikely He kept his ground and the boat passed within a foot of
him gliding silently into the gulf He observed that Burgesss usually
florid face was pale and that his left sleeve was cut open showing a
bandage on the arm There had been some fighting then and it was not
unlikely that all his fellowdesperadoes had been captured He chuckled
at his own ingenuity and good sense The boat emerging from the
archway entered the pool of the Blowhole and held with the full
strength of the party remained stationary John Rex watched Burgess
scan the rocks and eddies saw him signal to McNab and then with much
relief beheld the boats head brought round to the seaboard

He was so intent upon watching this dangerous and difficult operation
that he was oblivious of an extraordinary change which had taken place
in the interior of the cavern The water which an hour ago had left
exposed a long reef of black hummockrocks was now spread in one
foamflecked sheet over the ragged bottom of the rude staircase by which
he had descended The tide had turned and the sea apparently sucked in
through some deeper tunnel in the portion of the cliff which was below
water was being forced into the vault with a rapidity which bid fair to
shortly submerge the mouth of the cave The convicts feet were already
wetted by the incoming waves and as he turned for one last look at the
boat he saw a green billow heave up against the entrance to the chasm
and almost blotting out the daylight roll majestically through the
arch It was high time for Burgess to take his departure if he did not
wish his whaleboat to be cracked like a nut against the roof of the
tunnel Alive to his danger the Commandant abandoned the search after
his late prisoners corpse and he hastened to gain the open sea The
boat carried backwards and upwards on the bosom of a monstrous wave
narrowly escaped destruction and John Rex climbing to the gallery saw
with much satisfaction the broad back of his outwitted gaoler disappear
round the sheltering promontory The last efforts of his pursuers
had failed and in another hour the only accessible entrance to the
convicts retreat was hidden under three feet of furious seawater

His gaolers were convinced of his death and would search for him no
more So far so good Now for the last desperate venturethe escape
from the wonderful cavern which was at once his shelter and his prison
Piling his wood together and succeeding after many efforts by the
aid of a flint and the ring which yet clung to his ankle in lighting
a fire and warming his chilled limbs in its cheering blaze he set
himself to meditate upon his course of action He was safe for the
present and the supply of food that the rock afforded was amply
sufficient to sustain life in him for many days but it was impossible
that he could remain for many days concealed He had no fresh water and
though by reason of the soaking he had received he had hitherto
felt little inconvenience from this cause the salt and acrid mussels
speedily induced a raging thirst which he could not alleviate It was
imperative that within fortyeight hours at farthest he should be on his
way to the peninsula He remembered the little stream into whichin his
flight of the previous nighthe had so nearly fallen and hoped to be
able under cover of the darkness to steal round the reef and reach it
unobserved His desperate scheme was then to commence He had to run
the gauntlet of the dogs and guards gain the peninsula and await the
rescuing vessel He confessed to himself that the chances were terribly
against him If Gabbett and the others had been recapturedas he
devoutly trustedthe coast would be comparatively clear but if they
had escaped he knew Burgess too well to think that he would give up the
chase while hope of retaking the absconders remained to him If indeed
all fell out as he had wished he had still to sustain life until Blunt
found himif haply Blunt had not returned wearied with useless and
dangerous waiting

As night came on and the firelight showed strange shadows waving from
the corners of the enormous vault while the dismal abysses beneath him
murmured and muttered with uncouth and ghastly utterance there
fell upon the lonely man the terror of Solitude Was this marvellous
hidingplace that he had discovered to be his sepulchre Was hea
monster amongst his fellowmento die some monstrous death entombed
in this mysterious and terrible cavern of the sea He had tried to
drive away these gloomy thoughts by sketching out for himself a plan of
actionbut in vain In vain he strove to picture in its completeness
thatas yet vaguedesign by which he promised himself to wrest from
the vanished son of the wealthy shipbuilder his name and heritage
His mind filled with forebodings of shadowy horror could not give
the subject the calm consideration which it needed In the midst of his
schemes for the baffling of the jealous love of the woman who was to
save him and the getting to England in shipwrecked and foreign guise
as the longlost heir to the fortune of Sir Richard Devine there arose
ghastly and awesome shapes of death and horror with whose terrible
unsubstantiality he must grapple in the lonely recesses of that dismal
cavern He heaped fresh wood upon his fire that the bright light might
drive out the gruesome things that lurked above below and around him
He became afraid to look behind him lest some shapeless mass of midsea
birthsome voracious polype with farreaching arms and jellied mouth
ever open to devourmight slide up over the edge of the dripping caves
below and fasten upon him in the darkness His imaginationalways
sufficiently vivid and spurred to an unnatural effect by the exciting
scenes of the previous nightpainted each patch of shadow clinging
batlike to the humid wall as some globular seaspider ready to drop
upon him with its viscid and claycold body and drain out his chilled
blood enfolding him in rough and hairy arms Each splash in the water
beneath him each sigh of the multitudinous and melancholy sea seemed
to prelude the laborious advent of some misshapen and ungainly
abortion of the ooze All the sensations induced by lapping water
and regurgitating waves took material shape and surrounded him All
creatures that could be engendered by slime and salt crept forth into
the firelight to stare at him Red dabs and splashes that were living
beings having a strange phosphoric light of their own glowed upon the
floor The livid encrustations of a hundred years of humidity slipped
from off the walls and painfully heaved their mushroom surfaces to the
blaze The red glow of the unwonted fire crimsoning the wet sides
of the cavern seemed to attract countless blisterous and transparent
shapelessnesses which elongated themselves towards him Bloodless and
bladdery things ran hither and thither noiselessly Strange carapaces
crawled from out of the rocks All the horrible unseen life of the ocean
seemed to be rising up and surrounding him He retreated to the brink of
the gulf and the glare of the upheld brand fell upon a rounded hummock
whose coronal of silky weed outfloating in the water looked like the
head of a drowned man He rushed to the entrance of the gallery and his
shadow thrown into the opening took the shape of an avenging phantom
with arms upraised to warn him back The naturalist the explorer
or the shipwrecked seaman would have found nothing frightful in this
exhibition of the harmless life of the Australian ocean But the
convicts guilty conscience long suppressed and derided asserted
itself in this hour when it was alone with Nature and Night The bitter
intellectual power which had so long supported him succumbed beneath
imaginationthe unconscious religion of the soul If ever he was nigh
repentance it was then Phantoms of his past crimes gibbered at him and
covering his eyes with his hands he fell shuddering upon his knees
The brand loosening from his grasp dropped into the gulf and was
extinguished with a hissing noise As if the sound had called up some
spirit that lurked below a whisper ran through the cavern

John Rex The hair on the convicts flesh stood up and he cowered to
the earth

John Rex

It was a human voice Whether of friend or enemy he did not pause to
think His terror overmastered all other considerations

Here here he cried and sprang to the opening of the vault

Arrived at the foot of the cliff Blunt and Staples found themselves in
almost complete darkness for the light of the mysterious fire which
had hitherto guided them had necessarily disappeared Calm as was
the night and still as was the ocean the sea yet ran with silent but
dangerous strength through the channel which led to the Blowhole and
Blunt instinctively feeling the boat drawn towards some unknown peril
held off the shelf of rocks out of reach of the current A sudden flash
of fire as from a flourished brand burst out above them and floating
downwards through the darkness in erratic circles came an atom of
burning wood Surely no one but a hunted man would lurk in such a savage
retreat

Blunt in desperate anxiety determined to risk all upon one venture
John Rex he shouted up through his rounded hands The light flashed
again at the eyehole of the mountain and on the point above them
appeared a wild figure holding in its hands a burning log whose
fierce glow illumined a face so contorted by deadly fear and agony of
expectation that it was scarce human

Here here

The poor devil seems halfcrazy said Will Staples under his breath
and then aloud Were FRIENDS A few moments sufficed to explain
matters The terrors which had oppressed John Rex disappeared in human
presence and the villains coolness returned Kneeling on the rock
platform he held parley

It is impossible for me to come down now he said The tide covers
the only way out of the cavern

Cant you dive through it said Will Staples

No nor you neither said Rex shuddering at the thought of trusting
himself to that horrible whirlpool

Whats to be done You cant come down that wall Wait until
morning returned Rex coolly It will be dead low tide at seven
oclock You must send a boat at six or thereabouts It will be low
enough for me to get out I dare say by that time

But the Guard

Wont come here my man Theyve got their work to do in watching the
Neck and exploring after my mates They wont come here Besides Im
dead

Dead

Thought to be so which is as wellbetter for me perhaps If they
dont see your ship or your boat youre safe enough

I dont like to risk it said Blunt Its Life if were caught

Its Death if Im caught returned the other with a sinister laugh
But theres no danger if you are cautious No one looks for rats in a
terriers kennel and theres not a station along the beach from here
to Cape Pillar Take your vessel out of eyeshot of the Neck bring the
boat up Descent Beach and the things done

Well says Blunt Ill try it

You wouldnt like to stop here till morning It is rather lonely
suggested Rex absolutely making a jest of his late terrors

Will Staples laughed Youre a bold boy said he Well come at
daybreak

Have you got the clothes as I directed

Yes

Then good night Ill put my fire out in case somebody else might see
it who wouldnt be as kind as you are

Good night

Not a word for the Madam said Staples when they reached the vessel

Not a word the ungrateful dog asserted Blunt adding with some
heat Thats the way with women Theyll go through fire and water for
a man that doesnt care a snap of his fingers for em but for any poor
fellow who risks his neck to pleasure em theyve nothing but sneers I
wish Id never meddled in the business

There are no fools like old fools thought Will Staples looking back
through the darkness at the place where the fire had been but he did
not utter his thoughts aloud

At eight oclock the next morning the Pretty Mary stood out to sea with
every stitch of canvas set alow and aloft The skippers fishing had
come to an end He had caught a shipwrecked seaman who had been brought
on board at daylight and was then at breakfast in the cabin The crew
winked at each other when the haggard mariner attired in garments that
seemed remarkably well preserved mounted the side But they none of
them were in a position to controvert the skippers statement

Where are we bound for asked John Rex smoking Stapless pipe in
lingering puffs of delight Im entirely in your hands Blunt

My orders are to cruise about the whaling grounds until I meet my
consort returned Blunt sullenly and put you aboard her Shell take
you back to Sydney Im victualled for a twelvemonths trip

Right cried Rex clapping his preserver on the back Im bound to
get to Sydney somehow but as the Philistines are abroad I may as well
tarry in Jericho till my beard be grown Dont stare at my Scriptural
quotation Mr Staples he added inspirited by creature comforts and
secure amid his purchased friends I assure you that Ive had the very
best religious instruction Indeed it is chiefly owing to my worthy
spiritual pastor and master that I am enabled to smoke this very
villainous tobacco of yours at the present moment




CHAPTER XXVII THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH



It was not until they had scrambled up the beach to safety that
the absconders became fully aware of the loss of another of their
companions As they stood on the break of the beach wringing the water
from their clothes Gabbetts small eye counting their number missed
the stroke oar

Wheres Cox

The fool fell overboard said Jemmy Vetch shortly He never had
as much sense in that skull of his as would keep it sound on his
shoulders

Gabbett scowled Thats three of us gone he said in the tones of a
man suffering some personal injury

They summed up their means of defence against attack Sanders and
Greenhill had knives Gabbett still retained the axe in his belt Vetch
had dropped his musket at the Neck and Bodenham and Cornelius were
unarmed

Lets have a look at the tucker said Vetch

There was but one bag of provisions It contained a piece of salt pork
two loaves and some uncooked potatoes Signal Hill station was not rich
in edibles

That aint much said the Crow with rueful face Is it Gabbett

It must do any way returned the giant carelessly

The inspection over the six proceeded up the shore and encamped under
the lee of a rock Bodenham was for lighting a fire but Vetch who
by tacit consent had been chosen leader of the expedition forbade it
saying that the light might betray them Theyll think were drowned
and wont pursue us he said So all that night the miserable wretches
crouched fireless together

Morning breaks clear and bright andfree for the first time in ten
yearsthey comprehend that their terrible journey has begun Where are
we to go How are we to live asked Bodenham scanning the barren
bush that stretches to the barren sea Gabbett youve been out
beforehows it done

Well make the shepherds huts and live on their tucker till we get
a change o clothes said Gabbett evading the main question We can
follow the coastline

Steady lads said prudent Vetch we must sneak round yon sandhills
and so creep into the scrub If theyve a good glass at the Neck they
can see us

It does seem close said Bodenham I could pitch a stone on to the
guardhouse Goodbye you Bloody Spot he adds with sudden rage
shaking his fist vindictively at the Penitentiary I dont want to see
you no more till the Day o Judgment

Vetch divides the provisions and they travel all that day until dark
night The scrub is prickly and dense Their clothes are torn their
hands and feet bleeding Already they feel outwearied No one pursuing
they light a fire and sleep The second day they come to a sandy spit
that runs out into the sea and find that they have got too far to the
eastward and must follow the shore line to East Bay Neck Back through
the scrub they drag their heavy feet That night they eat the last
crumb of the loaf The third day at high noonafter some toilsome
walkingthey reach a big hill now called Collins Mount and see the
upper link of the earring the isthmus of East Bay Neck at their feet
A few rocks are on their right hand and blue in the lovely distance
lies hated Maria Island We must keep well to the eastward said
Greenhill or we shall fall in with the settlers and get taken So
passing the isthmus they strike into the bush along the shore and
tightening their belts over their gnawing bellies camp under some
lowlying hills

The fourth day is notable for the indisposition of Bodenham who is a
bad walker and falling behind delays the party by frequent cooees
Gabbett threatens him with a worse fate than sore feet if he lingers
Luckily that evening Greenhill espies a hut but not trusting to the
friendship of the occupant they wait until he quits it in the morning
and then send Vetch to forage Vetch secretly congratulating himself on
having by his counsel prevented violence returns bending under half a
bag of flour Youd better carry the flour said he to Gabbett and
give me the axe Gabbett eyes him for a while as if struck by his puny
form but finally gives the axe to his mate Sanders That day they creep
along cautiously between the sea and the hills camping at a creek
Vetch after much search finds a handful of berries and adds them to
the main stock Half of this handful is eaten at once the other half
reserved for tomorrow The next day they come to an arm of the sea
and as they struggle northward Maria Island disappears and with it all
danger from telescopes That evening they reach the camping ground by
twos and threes and each wonders between the paroxysms of hunger if
his face is as haggard and his eyes as bloodshot as those of his
neighbour

On the seventh day Bodenham says his feet are so bad he cant walk
and Greenhill with a greedy look at the berries bids him stay behind
Being in a very weak condition he takes his companion at his word and
drops off about noon the next day Gabbett discovering this defection
however goes back and in an hour or so appears driving the wretched
creature before him with blows as a sheep is driven to the shambles
Greenhill remonstrates at another mouth being thus forced upon the
party but the giant silences him with a hideous glance Jemmy Vetch
remembers that Greenhill accompanied Gabbett once before and feels
uncomfortable He gives hint of his suspicions to Sanders but Sanders
only laughs It is horribly evident that there is an understanding among
the three

The ninth sun of their freedom rising upon sandy and barren hillocks
bristling thick with cruel scrub sees the six faminestricken wretches
cursing their God and yet afraid to die All around is the fruitless
shadeless shelterless bush Above the pitiless heaven In the
distance the remorseless sea Something terrible must happen That grey
wilderness arched by grey heaven stooping to grey sea is a fitting
keeper of hideous secrets Vetch suggests that Oyster Bay cannot be far
to the eastwardthe line of ocean is deceitfully closeand though such
a proceeding will take them out of their course they resolve to make
for it After hobbling five miles they seem no nearer than before
and nigh dead with fatigue and starvation sink despairingly upon the
ground Vetch thinks Gabbetts eyes have a wolfish glare in them and
instinctively draws off from him Said Greenhill in the course of a
dismal conversation I am so weak that I could eat a piece of a man

On the tenth day Bodenham refuses to stir and the others being scarce
able to drag along their limbs sit on the ground about him Greenhill
eyeing the prostrate man said slowly I have seen the same done
before boys and it tasted like pork

Vetch hearing his savage comrade give utterance to a thought all had
secretly cherished speaks out crying It would be murder to do it
and then perhaps we couldnt eat it

Oh said Gabbett with a grin Ill warrant you that but you must
all have a hand in it

Gabbett Sanders and Greenhill then go aside and presently Sanders
coming to the Crow said He consented to act as flogger He deserves
it

So did Gabbett for that matter shudders Vetch

Ay but Bodenhams feet are sore said Sanders and tis a pity to
leave him

Having no fire they make a little breakwind and Vetch halfdozing
behind this at about three in the morning hears someone cry out
Christ and awakes sweating ice

No one but Gabbett and Greenhill would eat that night That savage pair
however make a fire fling ghastly fragments on the embers and eat the
broil before it is right warm In the morning the frightful carcase is
divided That days march takes place in silence and at midday halt
Cornelius volunteers to carry the billy affecting great restoration
from the food Vetch gives it to him and in half an hour afterwards
Cornelius is missing Gabbett and Greenhill pursue him in vain and
return with curses Hell die like a dog said Greenhill alone in
the bush Jemmy Vetch with his intellect acute as ever thinks that
Cornelius may prefer such a death but says nothing

The twelfth morning dawns wet and misty but Vetch seeing the provision
running short strives to be cheerful telling stories of men who have
escaped greater peril Vetch feels with dismay that he is the weakest
of the party but has some sort of ludicrohorrible consolation in
remembering that he is also the leanest They come to a creek that
afternoon and look until nightfall in vain for a crossingplace The
next day Gabbett and Vetch swim across and Vetch directs Gabbett to cut
a long sapling which being stretched across the water is seized by
Greenhill and the Moocher who are dragged over

What would you do without me said the Crow with a ghastly grin

They cannot kindle a fire for Greenhill who carries the tinder has
allowed it to get wet The giant swings his axe in savage anger at
enforced cold and Vetch takes an opportunity to remark privately to him
what a big man Greenhill is

On the fourteenth day they can scarcely crawl and their limbs pain
them Greenhill who is the weakest sees Gabbett and the Moocher go
aside to consult and crawling to the Crow whimpers For Gods sake
Jemmy dont let em murder me

I cant help you says Vetch looking about in terror Think of poor
Tom Bodenham

But he was no murderer If they kill me I shall go to hell with Toms
blood on my soul He writhes on the ground in sickening terror and
Gabbett arriving bids Vetch bring wood for the fire Vetch going sees
Greenhill clinging to wolfish Gabbetts knees and Sanders calls after
him You will hear it presently Jem

The nervous Crow puts his hand to his ears but is conscious of a dull
crash and a groan When he comes back Gabbett is putting on the dead
mans shoes which are better than his own

Well stop here a day or so and rest said he now weve got
provisions

Two more days pass and the three eyeing each other suspiciously
resume their march The third daythe sixteenth of their awful
journeysuch portions of the carcase as they have with them prove unfit
to eat They look into each others faminesharpened faces and wonder
whos next

We must all die together said Sanders quickly before anything else
must happen

Vetch marks the terror concealed in the words and when the dreaded
giant is out of earshot says For Gods sake lets go on alone
Alick You see what sort of a cove that Gabbett ished kill his father
before hed fast one day

They made for the bush but the giant turned and strode towards them
Vetch skipped nimbly on one side but Gabbett struck the Moocher on the
forehead with the axe Help Jem help cried the victim cut but not
fatally and in the strength of his desperation tore the axe from the
monster who bore it and flung it to Vetch Keep it Jemmy he cried
lets have no more murder done

They fare again through the horrible bush until nightfall when Vetch
in a strange voice called the giant to him

He must die

Either you or he laughs Gabbett Give me the axe

No no said the Crow his thin malignant face distorted by a
horrible resolution Ill keep the axe Stand back You shall hold him
and Ill do the job

Sanders seeing them approach knew his end was come and submitted
crying Give me half an hour to pray for myself They consent and the
bewildered wretch knelt down and folded his hands like a child His
big stupid face worked with emotion His great cracked lips moved
in desperate agony He wagged his head from side to side in pitiful
confusion of his brutalized senses I cant think o the words Jem

Pah snarled the cripple swinging the axe we cant starve here all
night

Four days had passed and the two survivors of this awful journey sat
watching each other The gaunt giant his eyes gleaming with hate
and hunger sat sentinel over the dwarf The dwarf chuckling at his
superior sagacity clutched the fatal axe For two days they had not
spoken to each other For two days each had promised himself that on the
next his companion must sleepand die Vetch comprehended the devilish
scheme of the monster who had entrapped five of his fellowbeings to aid
him by their deaths to his own safety and held aloof Gabbett watched
to snatch the weapon from his companion and make the odds even once and
for ever In the daytime they travelled on seeking each a pretext to
creep behind the other In the nighttime when they feigned slumber
each stealthily raising a head caught the wakeful glance of his
companion Vetch felt his strength deserting him and his brain
overpowered by fatigue Surely the giant muttering gesticulating and
slavering at the mouth was on the road to madness Would the monster
find opportunity to rush at him and braving the bloodstained axe
kill him by main force or would he sleep and be himself a victim
Unhappy Vetch It is the terrible privilege of insanity to be sleepless

On the fifth day Vetch creeping behind a tree takes off his belt and
makes a noose He will hang himself He gets one end of the belt over
a bough and then his cowardice bids him pause Gabbett approaches
he tries to evade him and steal away into the bush In vain The
insatiable giant ravenous with famine and sustained by madness is not
to be shaken off Vetch tries to run but his legs bend under him The
axe that has tried to drink so much blood feels heavy as lead He will
fling it away Nohe dares not Night falls again He must rest or go
mad His limbs are powerless His eyelids are glued together He sleeps
as he stands This horrible thing must be a dream He is at Port Arthur
or will wake on his pallet in the penny lodginghouse he slept at when a
boy Is that the Deputy come to wake him to the torment of living It is
not timesurely not time yet He sleepsand the giant grinning with
ferocious joy approaches on clumsy tiptoe and seizes the coveted axe

On the north coast of Van Diemens Land is a place called St Helens
Point and a certain skipper being in want of fresh water landing
there with a boats crew found on the banks of the creek a gaunt and
bloodstained man clad in tattered yellow who carried on his back an
axe and a bundle When the sailors came within sight of him he made
signs to them to approach and opening his bundle with much ceremony
offered them some of its contents Filled with horror at what the maniac
displayed they seized and bound him At Hobart Town he was recognized
as the only survivor of the nine desperadoes who had escaped from
Colonel Arthurs Natural Penitentiary

BOOK IVNORFOLK ISLAND 1846




CHAPTER I EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF THE REV JAMES NORTH



Bathurst February 11th 1846

In turning over the pages of my journal to note the good fortune that
has just happened to me I am struck by the utter desolation of my life
for the last seven years

Can it be possible that I James North the collegehero the poet the
prizeman the Heaven knows what else have been content to live on at
this dreary spotan animal eating and drinking for tomorrow I die
Yet it has been so My world that world of which I once dreamt so much
has beenhere My famewhich was to reach the ends of the earthhas
penetrated to the neighbouring stations I am considered a good
preacher by my sheepfeeding friends It is kind of them

Yet on the eve of leaving it I confess that this solitary life has not
been without its charms I have had my books and my thoughtsthough
at times the latter were but grim companions I have striven with my
familiar sin and have not always been worsted Melancholy reflection
Not always But yet is as a gaoler to bring forth some monstrous
malefactor I vowed however that I would not cheat myself in this
diary of mine and I will not No evasions no glossings over of my own
sins This journal is my confessor and I bare my heart to it

It is curious the pleasure I feel in setting down here in black and
white these agonies and secret cravings of which I dare not speak It is
for the same reason I suppose that murderers make confession to
dogs and cats that people with something on their mind are given to
thinking aloud that the queen of Midas must needs whisper to the sedges
the secret of her husbands infirmity Outwardly I am a man of God
pious and grave and softly spoken Inwardlywhat The mean cowardly
weak sinner that this book knows meImp I could tear you in
piecesOne of these days I will In the meantime I will keep you
under lock and key and you shall hug my secrets close No old friend
with whom I have communed so long forgive me forgive me You are to me
instead of wife or priest

I tell to your cold blue pageshow much was it I bought you for in
Parramatta rascalthese stories longings remorses which I would
fain tell to human ear could I find a human being as discreet as thou
It has been said that a man dare not write all his thoughts and deeds
the words would blister the paper Yet your sheets are smooth enough
you fat rogue Our neighbours of Rome know human nature A man must
confess One reads of wretches who have carried secrets in their bosoms
for years and blurted them forth at last I shut up here without
companionship without sympathy without letters cannot lock up my
soul and feed on my own thoughts They will out and so I whisper them
to thee

What art thou thou tremendous power Who dost inhabit us without our
leave And art within ourselves another self A master self that loves
to domineer

What Conscience That is a word to frighten children The conscience of
each man is of his own making My friend the sharktoothed cannibal whom
Staples brought in his whaler to Sydney would have found his conscience
reproach him sorely did he refuse to partake of the feasts made sacred
by the customs of his ancestors A spark of divinity The divinity that
according to received doctrine sits apart enthroned amid sweet music
and leaves poor humanity to earn its condemnation as it may Ill have
none of thatthough I preach it One must soothe the vulgar senses
of the people Priesthood has its pious frauds The Master spoke in
parables Wit The wit that sees how illbalanced are our actions and
our aspirations The devilish wit born of our own brain that sneers at
us for our own failings Perhaps madness More likely for there are few
men who are not mad one hour of the waking twelve If differing from
the judgment of the majority of mankind in regard to familiar things be
madness I suppose I am mador too wise The speculation draws near to
hairsplitting James North recall your early recklessness your ruin
and your redemption bring your mind back to earth Circumstances have
made you what you are and will shape your destiny for you without your
interference Thats comfortably settled

Now supposingto take another canter on my nightmarethat man is
the slave of circumstances a doctrine which I am inclined to believe
though unwilling to confess what circumstance can have brought about
the sudden awakening of the powers that be to James Norths fitness for
duty


HOBART TOWN Jan 12th

DEAR NORTHI have much pleasure in informing you that you can be
appointed Protestant chaplain at Norfolk Island if you like It seems
that they did not get on well with the last man and when my advice was
asked I at once recommended you for the office The pay is small but
you have a house and so on It is certainly better than Bathurst and
indeed is considered rather a prize in the clerical lottery

There is to be an investigation into affairs down there Poor old
Prattwho went down as you know at the earnest solicitation of the
Governmentseems to have become absurdly lenient with the prisoners
and it is reported that the island is in a frightful state Sir Eardley
is looking out for some disciplinarian to take the place in hand

In the meantime the chaplaincy is vacant and I thought of you


I must consider this seeming good fortune further

February 19thI accept There is work to be done among those unhappy
men that may be my purgation The authorities shall hear me yetthough
inquiry was stifled at Port Arthur By the way a Pharaoh had arisen
who knows not Joseph It is evident that the meddlesome parson who
complained of men being flogged to death is forgotten as the men are
How many ghosts must haunt the dismal loneliness of that prison shore
Poor Burgess is gone the way of all flesh I wonder if his spirit
revisits the scenes of its violences I have written poor Burgess

It is strange how we pity a man gone out of this life Enmity is
extinguished when one can but remember injuries If a man had injured
me the fact of his living at all would be sufficient grounds for me to
hate him if I had injured him I should hate him still more Is that
the reason I hate myself at timesmy greatest enemy and one whom I
have injured beyond forgiveness There are offences against ones own
nature that are not to be forgiven Isnt it Tacitus who says the
hatred of those most nearly related is most inveterate ButI am
taking flight again

February 27th 1130 pmNine Creeks Station I do like to be accurate
in names dates etc Accuracy is a virtue To exercise it then
Station ninety miles from Bathurst I should say about 4000 head of
cattle Luxury without refinement Plenty to eat drink and read
Hostesss nameCarr She is a wellpreserved creature about
thirtyfour years of age and a clever womannot in a poetical sense
but in the widest worldly acceptation of the term At the same time I
should be sorry to be her husband Women have no business with a brain
like hersthat is if they wish to be women and not sexual monsters
Mrs Carr is not a lady though she might have been one I dont think
she is a good woman either It is possible indeed that she has known
the factory before now There is a mystery about her for I was informed
that she was a Mrs Purfoy the widow of a whaling captain and had
married one of her assigned servants who had deserted her five years
ago as soon as he obtained his freedom A word or two at dinner set me
thinking She had received some English papers and accounting for her
preoccupied manner grimly said I think I have news of my husband
I should not like to be in Carrs shoes if she has news of him I dont
think she would suffer indignity calmly After all what business is it
of mine I was beguiled into taking more wine at dinner than I needed
Confessor do you hear me But I will not allow myself to be carried
away You grin you fat Familiar So may I but I shall be eaten with
remorse tomorrow

March 3rdA place called Jerrilang where I have a head and heartache
One that hath let go himself from the hold and stay of reason and lies
open to the mercy of all temptations

March 20thSydney At Captain FreresSeventeen days since I have
opened you beloved and detested companion of mine I have more than
half a mind to never open you again To read you is to recall to myself
all I would most willingly forget yet not to read you would be to
forget all that which I should for my sins remember

The last week has made a new man of me I am no longer morose
despairing and bitter but genial and on good terms with fortune It
is strange that accident should have induced me to stay a week under the
same roof with that vision of brightness which has haunted me so long
A meeting in the street an introduction an invitationthe thing is
done

The circumstances which form our fortunes are certainly curious things
I had thought never again to meet the bright young face to which I
felt so strange an attractionand lo here it is smiling on me daily
Captain Frere should be a happy man Yet there is a skeleton in this
house also That young wife by nature so lovable and so mirthful ought
not to have the sadness on her face that twice today has clouded it
He seems a passionate and boorish creature this wonderful convict
disciplinarian His convictspoor devilsare doubtless disciplined
enough Charming little Sylvia with your quaint wit and weird beauty
he is not good enough for youand yet it was a love match

March 21stI have read family prayers every night since I have been
heremy black coat and white tie gave me the natural preeminence in
such mattersand I feel guilty every time I read I wonder what the
little lady of the devotional eyes would say if she knew that I am a
miserable hypocrite preaching that which I do not practise exhorting
others to believe those marvels which I do not believe I am a coward
not to throw off the saintly mask and appear as a Freethinker Yet am
I a coward I urge upon myself that it is for the glory of God I hold
my peace The scandal of a priest turned infidel would do more harm
than the reign of reason would do good Imagine this trustful woman for
instanceshe would suffer anguish at the thoughts of such a sin though
another were the sinner If anyone offend one of these little ones it
were better for him that a millstone be hanged about his neck and
that he be cast into the sea Yet truth is truth and should be
spokenshould it not malignant monitor who remindest me how often I
fail to speak it Surely among all his army of blackcoats our worthy
Bishop must have some men like me who cannot bring their reason to
believe in things contrary to the experience of mankind and the laws of
nature

March 22ndThis unromantic Captain Frere had had some romantic
incidents in his life and he is fond of dilating upon them It seems
that in early life he expected to have been left a large fortune by an
uncle who had quarrelled with his heir But the uncle dies on the day
fixed for the altering of the will the son disappears and is thought
to be drowned The widow however steadfastly refuses to believe in
any report of the young mans death and having a lifeinterest in the
property holds it against all comers My poor host in consequence comes
out here on his pay and three years ago just as he is hoping that the
death of his aunt may give him opportunity to enforce a claim as next
of kin to some portion of the property the longlost son returns
is recognized by his mother and the trustees and installed in due
heirship The other romantic story is connected with Freres marriage
He told me after dinner tonight how his wife had been wrecked when a
child and how he had saved her life and defended her from the rude
hands of an escaped convictone of the monsters our monstrous system
breeds That was how we fell in love said he tossing off his wine
complacently

An auspicious opportunity said I To which he nodded He is not
overburdened with brains I fancy Let me see if I can set down some
account of this lovely place and its people

A long low white house surrounded by a blooming garden Wide windows
opening on a lawn The ever glorious ever changing sea beneath It is
evening I am talking with Mrs Frere of theories of social reform
of picture galleries of sunsets and new books There comes a sound
of wheels on the gravel It is the magistrate returned from his
convictdiscipline We hear him come briskly up the steps but we go on
talking I fancy there was a time when the lady would have run to
meet him He enters coldly kisses his wife and disturbs at once the
current of our thoughts It has been hot today What still no letter
from headquarters Mr North I saw Mrs Golightly in town Sylvia and
she asked for you There is to be a ball at Government House We must
go Then he departs and is heard in the distance indistinctly cursing
because the water is not hot enough or because Dawkins his convict
servant has not brushed his trousers sufficiently We resume our chat
but he returns all hungry and bluff and whiskerbrushed Dinner
Haha Im ready for it North take Mrs Frere By and by it is
North some sherry Sylvia the soup is spoilt again Did you go out
today No His eyebrows contract here and I know he says inwardly
Reading some trashy novel I suppose However he grins and
obligingly relates how the police have captured Cockatoo Bill the noted
bushranger

After dinner the disciplinarian and I converseof dogs and horses
gamecocks convicts and moving accidents by flood and field I remember
old college feats and strive to keep pace with him in the relation of
athletics What hypocrites we arefor all the time I am longing to
get to the drawingroom and finish my criticism of the new poet Mr
Tennyson to Mrs Frere Frere does not read Tennysonnor anybody else
Adjourned to the drawingroom we chatMrs Frere and Iuntil supper
He eats supper She is a charming companion and when I talk my
bestI can talk you must admit O Familiarher face lightens up
with an interest I rarely see upon it at other times I feel cooled and
soothed by this companionship The quiet refinement of this house after
bullocks and Bathurst is like the shadow of a great rock in a weary
land

Mrs Frere is about fiveandtwenty She is rather beneath the middle
height with a slight girlish figure This girlish appearance is
enhanced by the fact that she has bright fair hair and blue eyes Upon
conversation with her however one sees that her face has lost much of
the delicate plumpness which it probably owned in youth She has had one
child born only to die Her cheeks are thin and her eyes have a tinge
of sadness which speak of physical pain or mental grief This thinness
of face makes the eyes appear larger and the brow broader than they
really are Her hands are white and painfully thin They must have been
plump and pretty once Her lips are red with perpetual fever

Captain Frere seems to have absorbed all his wifes vitality Who
quotes the story of Lucius Claudius Hermippus who lived to a great age
by being constantly breathed on by young girls I suppose Burtonwho
quotes everything In proportion as she has lost her vigour and youth
he has gained strength and heartiness Though he is at least forty years
of age he does not look more than thirty His face is ruddy his eyes
bright his voice firm and ringing He must be a man of considerable
strength andI should sayof more than ordinary animal courage and
animal appetite There is not a nerve in his body which does not twang
like a piano wire In appearance he is tall broad and bluff with
red whiskers and reddish hair slightly touched with grey His manner
is loud coarse and imperious his talk of dogs horses and convicts
What a strangelymated pair

March 30thA letter from Van Diemens Land There is a row in the
pantry said Frere with his accustomed slang It seems that the
ComptrollerGeneral of Convicts has appointed a Mr Pounce to go down
and make a report on the state of Norfolk Island I am to go down
with him and shall receive instructions to that effect from the
ComptrollerGeneral I have informed Frere of this and he has written
to Pounce to come and stay on his way down There has been nothing but
convict discipline talked since Frere is great upon this point and
wearies me with his explanations of convict tricks and wickedness He
is celebrated for his knowledge of such matters Detestable wisdom His
servants hate him but they obey him without a murmur I have observed
that habitual criminalslike all savage beastscower before the
man who has once mastered them I should not be surprised if the Van
Diemens Land Government selected Frere as their disciplinarian I
hope they wont and yet I hope they will

April 4thNothing worth recording until today Eating drinking and
sleeping Despite my fortyseven years I begin to feel almost like the
James North who fought the bargee and took the gold medal What a drink
water is The fons Bandusiae splendidior vitreo was better than all the
Massic Master Horace I doubt if your celebrated liquor bottled when
Manlius was consul could compare with it

But to my notable facts I have found out tonight two things which
surprise me One is that the convict who attempted the life of Mrs
Frere is none other than the unhappy man whom my fatal weakness caused
to be flogged at Port Arthur and whose face comes before me to reproach
me even now The other that Mrs Carr is an old acquaintance of Freres
The latter piece of information I obtained in a curious way One night
while Mrs Frere was not there we were talking of clever women I
broached my theory that strong intellect in women went far to destroy
their womanly nature

Desire in man said I should be Volition in women Reason
Intuition Reverence Devotion Passion Love The woman should strike
a lower keynote but a sharper sound Man has vigour of reason
woman quickness of feeling The woman who possesses masculine force of
intellect is abnormal He did not half comprehend me I could see but
he agreed with the broad view of the case I only knew one woman who
was really strongminded as they call it he said and she was a
regular bad one

It does not follow that she should be bad said I This one was
thoughstock lock and barrel But as sharp as a needle sir and as
immovable as a rock A fine woman too I saw by the expression of the
mans face that he owned ugly memories and pressed him further Shes
up country somewhere he said Married her assigned servant I was
told a fellow named Carr I havent seen her for years and dont know
what she may be like now but in the days when I knew her she was just
what you describe Let it be noted that I had described nothing She
came out in the ship with me as maid to my wifes mother

It was on the tip of my tongue to say that I had met her but I dont
know what induced me to be silent There are passages in the lives of
men of Captain Freres complexion which dont bear descanting on
I expect there have been in this case for he changed the subject
abruptly as his wife came in Is it possible that these two
creaturesthe notable disciplinarian and the wife of the assigned
servantcould have been more than friends in youth Quite possible
He is the sort of man for gross amours A pretty way I am abusing my
host And the supple woman with the dark eyes would have been just the
creature to enthral him Perhaps some such story as this may account in
part for Mrs Freres sad looks Why do I speculate on such things
I seem to do violence to myself and to insult her by writing such
suspicions If I was a Flagellant now I would don hairshirt and up
flail For this sort cometh not out but by prayer and fasting

April 7thMr Pounce has arrivedfull of the importance of his
mission He walks with the air of a minister of state on the eve of a
vacant garter hoping wondering fearing and dignified even in his
dubitancy I am as flippant as a schoolgirl concerning this fatuous
official and yetHeaven knowsI feel deeply enough the importance of
the task he has before him One relieves ones brain by these whirlings
of ones mental limbs I remember that a prisoner at Hobart Town
twice condemned and twice reprieved jumped and shouted with frenzied
vehemence when he heard his sentence of death was finally pronounced He
told me if he had not so shouted he believed he would have gone mad

April 10thWe had a state dinner last night The conversation was
about nothing in the world but convicts I never saw Mrs Frere to less
advantage Silent distraite and sad She told me after dinner that
she disliked the very name of convict from early associations I have
lived among them all my life she said but that does not make it the
better for me I have terrible fancies at times Mr North that seem
halfmemories I dread to be brought in contact with prisoners again I
am sure that some evil awaits me at their hands

I laughed of course but it would not do She holds to her own opinion
and looks at me with horror in her eyes This terror in her face is
perplexing

You are nervous I said You want rest

I am nervous she replied with that candour of voice and manner I
have before remarked in her and I have presentiments of evil

We sat silent for a while and then she suddenly turned her large
eyes on me and said calmly Mr North what death shall I die The
question was an echo of my own thoughtsI have some foolish  fancies
as to physiognomyand it made me start What death indeed What sort
of death would one meet with widelyopened eyes parted lips and
brows bent as though to rally fastflying courage Not a peaceful death
surely I brought my black coat to my aid My dear lady you must not
think of such things Death is but a sleep you know Why anticipate a
nightmare

She sighed slowly awaking as though from some momentary trance
Checking herself on the verge of tears she rallied turned the
conversation and finding an excuse for going to the piano dashed into
a waltz This unnatural gaiety ended I fancy in an hysterical fit I
heard her husband afterwards recommending sal volatile He is the
sort of man who would recommend sal volatile to the Pythoness if she
consulted him

April 26thAll has been arranged and we start tomorrow Mr Pounce
is in a condition of painful dignity He seems afraid to move lest
motion should thaw his official ice Having found out that I am the
chaplain he has refrained from familiarity My selflove is wounded
but my patience relieved Query Would not the majority of mankind
rather be bored by people in authority than not noticed by them James
North declines to answer for his part I have made my farewells to my
friends and on looking back on the pleasant hours I have spent felt
saddened It is not likely that I shall have many such pleasant hours
I feel like a vagabond who having been allowed to sit by a cheerful
fireside for a while is turned out into the wet and windy streets and
finds them colder than ever What were the lines I wrote in her album


As some poor tavernhaunter drenched in wine With staggering footsteps
through the streets returning Seeing through blinding rain a beacon
shine From household lamp in happy window burning

Pauses an instant at the reddened pane To gaze on that sweet scene of
love and duty Then turns into the wild wet night again Lest his sad
presence mar its homely beauty


Yes those were the lines With more of truth in them than she expected
and yet what business have I sentimentalizing My socius thinks what a
puling fool this North is

So thats over Now for Norfolk Island and my purgation




CHAPTER II THE LOST HEIR



The lost son of Sir Richard Devine had returned to England and made
claim to his name and fortune In other words John Rex had successfully
carried out the scheme by which he had usurped the rights of his old
convictcomrade

Smoking his cigar in his bachelor lodgings or pausing in a calculation
concerning a race John Rex often wondered at the strange ease with
which he had carried out so monstrous and seemingly difficult an
imposture After he was landed in Sydney by the vessel which Sarah
Purfoy had sent to save him he found himself a slave to a bondage
scarcely less galling than that from which he had escapedthe bondage
of enforced companionship with an unloved woman The opportune death of
one of her assigned servants enabled Sarah Purfoy to instal the escaped
convict in his room In the strange state of society which prevailed
of necessity in New South Wales at that period it was not unusual for
assigned servants to marry among the free settlers and when it was
heard that Mrs Purfoy the widow of a whaling captain had married John
Carr her storekeeper transported for embezzlement and with two years
of his sentence yet to run no one expressed surprise Indeed when the
year after John Carr blossomed into an expiree master of a fine wife
and a fine fortune there were many about him who would have made his
existence in Australia pleasant enough But John Rex had no notion of
remaining longer than he could help and ceaselessly sought means of
escape from this second prisonhouse For a long time his search was
unsuccessful Much as she loved the scoundrel Sarah Purfoy did not
scruple to tell him that she had bought him and regarded him as her
property He knew that if he made any attempt to escape from his
marriagebonds the woman who had risked so much to save him would
not hesitate to deliver him over to the authorities and state how the
opportune death of John Carr had enabled her to give name and employment
to John Rex the absconder He had thought once that the fact of her
being his wife would prevent her from giving evidence against him and
that he could thus defy her But she reminded him that a word to Blunt
would be all sufficient

I know you dont care for me now John she said with grim
complacency but your life is in my hands and if you desert me I will
bring you to the gallows

In vain in his secret eagerness to be rid of her he raged and chafed
He was tied hand and foot She held his money and her shrewd wit had
more than doubled it She was allpowerful and he could but wait until
her death or some lucky accident should rid him of her and leave him
free to follow out the scheme he had matured Once rid of her he
thought in his solitary rides over the station of which he was the
nominal owner the rest is easy I shall return to England with a
plausible story of shipwreck and shall doubtless be received with open
arms by the dear mother from whom I have been so long parted Richard
Devine shall have his own again

To be rid of her was not so easy Twice he tried to escape from his
thraldom and was twice brought back I have bought you John his
partner had laughed and you dont get away from me Surely you can be
content with these comforts You were content with less once I am not
so ugly and repulsive am I

I am homesick John Carr retorted Let us go to England Sarah

She tapped her strong white fingers sharply on the table Go to
England No no That is what you would like to do You would be master
there You would take my money and leave me to starve I know you
Jack We stop here dear Here where I can hand you over to the first
trooper as an escaped convict if you are not kind to me

Shedevil

Oh I dont mind your abuse Abuse me if you like Jack Beat me if you
will but dont leave me or it will be worse for you

You are a strange woman he cried in sudden petulant admiration

To love such a villain I dont know that I love you because you are a
villain A better man would be wearisome to such as I am

I wish to Heaven Id never left Port Arthur Better there than this
dogs life

Go back then You have only to say the word And so they would
wrangle she glorying in her power over the man who had so long
triumphed over her and he consoling himself with the hope that the day
was not far distant which should bring him at once freedom and fortune
One day the chance came to him His wife was ill and the ungrateful
scoundrel stole five hundred pounds and taking two horses reached
Sydney and obtained passage in a vessel bound for Rio

Having escaped thraldom John Rex proceeded to play for the great stake
of his life with the utmost caution He went to the Continent and lived
for weeks together in the towns where Richard Devine might possibly have
resided familiarizing himself with streets making the acquaintance
of old inhabitants drawing into his own hands all loose ends of
information which could help to knit the meshes of his net the closer
Such loose ends were not numerous the prodigal had been too poor too
insignificant to leave strong memories behind him Yet Rex knew well
by what strange accidents the deceit of an assumed identity is often
penetrated Some old comrade or companion of the lost heir might
suddenly appear with keen questions as to trifles which could cut his
flimsy web to shreds as easily as the sword of Saladin divided the
floating silk He could not afford to ignore the most insignificant
circumstances With consummate skill piece by piece he built up the
story which was to deceive the poor mother and to make him possessor of
one of the largest private fortunes in England

This was the tale he hit upon He had been saved from the burning
Hydaspes by a vessel bound for Rio Ignorant of the death of Sir
Richard and prompted by the pride which was known to be a leading
feature of his character he had determined not to return until fortune
should have bestowed upon him wealth at least equal to the inheritance
from which he had been ousted In Spanish America he had striven to
accumulate that wealth in vain As vequero traveller speculator
sailor he had toiled for fourteen years and had failed Worn out and
penitent he had returned home to find a corner of English earth in
which to lay his weary bones The tale was plausible enough and in the
telling of it he was armed at all points There was little fear that
the navigator of the captured Osprey the man who had lived in Chile and
cut out cattle on the Carrum Plains would prove lacking in knowledge
of riding seamanship or Spanish customs Moreover he had determined
upon a course of action which showed his knowledge of human nature

The will under which Richard Devine inherited was dated in 1807 and had
been made when the testator was in the first hopeful glow of paternity
By its terms Lady Devine was to receive a life interest of three
thousand a year in her husbands propertywhich was placed in the
hands of two trusteesuntil her eldest son died or attained the age
of twentyfive years When either of these events should occur the
property was to be realized Lady Devine receiving a sum of a hundred
thousand pounds which invested in Consols for her benefit would
according to Sir Richards prudent calculation exactly compensate for
her loss of interest the remainder going absolutely to the son if
living to his children or next of kin if dead The trustees appointed
were Lady Devines father Colonel Wotton Wade and Mr Silas Quaid
of the firm of Purkiss and Quaid Thavies Inn Sir Richards solicitors
Colonel Wade before his death had appointed his son Mr Francis Wade
to act in his stead When Mr Quaid died the firm of Purkiss and Quaid
represented in the Quaid branch of it by a smart Londonbred nephew
declined further responsibility and with the consent of Lady Devine
Francis Wade continued alone in his trust Sir Richards sister and her
husband Anthony Frere of Bristol were long ago dead and as we know
their representative Maurice Frere content at last in the lot that
fortune had sent him had given up all thought of meddling with his
uncles business John Rex therefore in the person of the returned
Richard had but two persons to satisfy his putative uncle Mr Francis
Wade and his putative mother Lady Devine

This he found to be the easiest task possible Francis Wade was an
invalid virtuoso who detested business and whose ambition was to be
known as man of taste The possessor of a small independent income he
had resided at North End ever since his fathers death and had made the
place a miniature Strawberry Hill When at his sisters urgent wish he
assumed the sole responsibility of the estate he put all the floating
capital into 3 per cents and was content to see the interest
accumulate Lady Devine had never recovered the shock of the
circumstances attending Sir Richards death and clinging to the belief
in her sons existence regarded herself as the mere guardian of his
interests to be displaced at any moment by his sudden return The
retired pair lived thus together and spent in charity and bricabrac
about a fourth of their mutual income By both of them the return of
the wanderer was hailed with delight To Lady Devine it meant the
realization of a lifelong hope become part of her nature To Francis
Wade it meant relief from a responsibility which his simplicity always
secretly loathed the responsibility of looking after another persons
money

I shall not think of interfering with the arrangements which you have
made my dear uncle said Mr John Rex on the first night of his
reception It would be most ungrateful of me to do so My wants are
very few and can easily be supplied I will see your lawyers some day
and settle it

See them at once Richard see them at once I am no man of business
you know but I think you will find all right

Richard however put off the visit from day to day He desired to
have as little to do with lawyers as possible He had resolved upon
his course of action He would get money from his mother for immediate
needs and when that mother died he would assert his rights My rough
life has unfitted me for drawingrooms dear mother he said Do not
let there be a display about my return Give me a corner to smoke my
pipe and I am happy Lady Devine with a loving tender pity for which
John Rex could not altogether account consented and Mr Richard soon
came to be regarded as a martyr to circumstances a man conscious of his
own imperfections and one whose imperfections were therefore lightly
dwelt upon So the returned prodigal had his own suite of rooms his own
servants his own bank account drank smoked and was merry For five
or six months he thought himself in Paradise Then he began to find his
life insufferably weary The burden of hypocrisy is very heavy to bear
and Rex was compelled perpetually to bear it His mother demanded all
his time She hung upon his lips she made him repeat fifty times the
story of his wanderings She was never tired of kissing him of weeping
over him and of thanking him for the sacrifice he had made for her

We promised never to speak of it more Richard the poor lady said one
day but if my lifelong love can make atonement for the wrong I have
done you

Hush dearest mother said John Rex who did not in the least
comprehend what it was all about Let us say no more

Lady Devine wept quietly for a while and then went away leaving the
man who pretended to be her son much bewildered and a little frightened
There was a secret which he had not fathomed between Lady Devine and her
son The mother did not again refer to it and gaining courage as the
days went on Rex grew bold enough to forget his fears In the first
stages of his deception he had been timid and cautious Then the
soothing influence of comfort respect and security came upon him
and almost refined him He began to feel as he had felt when Mr Lionel
Crofton was alive The sensation of being ministered to by a loving
woman who kissed him night and morning calling him sonof being
regarded with admiration by rustics with envy by respectable folkof
being deferred to in all thingswas novel and pleasing They were so
good to him that he felt at times inclined to confess all and leave his
case in the hands of the folk he had injured Yethe thoughtsuch a
course would be absurd It would result in no benefit to anyone simply
in misery to himself The true Richard Devine was buried fathoms deep
in the greedy ocean of convictdiscipline and the waves of innumerable
punishments washed over him John Rex flattered himself that he had
usurped the name of one who was in fact no living man and that unless
one should rise from the dead Richard Devine could never return to
accuse him So flattering himself he gradually became bolder and by
slow degrees suffered his true nature to appear He was violent to the
servants cruel to dogs and horses often wantonly coarse in speech
and brutally regardless of the feelings of others Governed like most
women solely by her feelings Lady Devine had at first been prodigal
of her affection to the man she believed to be her injured son But his
rash acts of selfishness his habits of grossness and selfindulgence
gradually disgusted her For some time shepoor womanfought against
this feeling endeavouring to overcome her instincts of distaste and
arguing with herself that to permit a detestation of her unfortunate son
to arise in her heart was almost criminal but she was at length forced
to succumb

For the first year Mr Richard conducted himself with great propriety
but as his circle of acquaintance and his confidence in himself
increased he now and then forgot the part he was playing One day Mr
Richard went to pass the day with a sporting friend only too proud to
see at his table so wealthy and wonderful a man Mr Richard drank a
good deal more than was good for him and returned home in a condition
of disgusting drunkenness I say disgusting because some folks have the
art of getting drunk after a humorous fashion that robs intoxication of
half its grossness For John Rex to be drunk was to be himselfcoarse
and cruel Francis Wade was away and Lady Devine had retired for
the night when the dogcart brought home Mr Richard The virtuous
butlerporter who opened the door received a blow in the chest and
a demand for Brandy The groom was cursed and ordered to instant
oblivion Mr Richard stumbled into the diningroomveiled in dim light
as a diningroom which was sitting up for its master ought to beand
ordered more candles The candles were brought after some delay and
Mr Richard amused himself by spilling their meltings upon the carpet
Lets have luminashon he cried and climbing with muddy boots upon
the costly chairs scraping with his feet the polished table attempted
to fix the wax in the silver sconces with which the antiquarian tastes
of Mr Francis Wade had adorned the room

Youll break the table sir said the servant

Damn the table said Rex Buy nother table Whats table tyou
Oh certainly sir replied the man

Oh certnly Why certnly What do you know about it

Oh certainly not sir replied the man

began to shout and blaspheme

ventured to suggest

mirrordont grin at me Play up there Wheres old woman Fetch her
out and lets dance

Lady Devine has gone to bed Mr Richard cried Tomkins aghast
attempting to bar the passage to the upper regions

Then lets have her out o bed cried John Rex plunging to the door

Tomkins attempting to restrain him is instantly hurled into a cabinet
of rare china and the drunken brute essays the stairs The other
servants seize him He curses and fights like a demon Doors bang open
lights gleam maids hover horrified asking if its fire and begging
for it to be put out The whole house is in an uproar in the midst
of which Lady Devine appears and looks down upon the scene Rex catches
sight of her and bursts into blasphemy She withdraws strangely
terrified and the animal torn bloody and blasphemous is at last
got into his own apartments the groom whose face had been seriously
damaged in the encounter bestowing a hearty kick on the prostrate
carcase at parting

The next morning Lady Devine declined to see her son though he sent a
special apology to her

I am afraid I was a little overcome by wine last night said he to
Tomkins Well you was sir said Tomkins

A very little wine makes me quite ill Tomkins Did I do anything very
violent

You was rather obstropolous Mr Richard

Heres a sovereign for you Tomkins Did I say anything

You cussed a good deal Mr Richard Most gents do when theyve
binhumdining out Mr Richard

What a fool I am thought John Rex as he dressed I shall spoil
everything if I dont take care He was right He was going the right
way to spoil everything However for this bout he made amendsmoney
soothed the servants hall and apologies and time won Lady Devines
forgiveness

I cannot yet conform to English habits my dear mother said Rex and
feel at times out of place in your quiet home I think thatif you can
spare me a little moneyI should like to travel

Lady Devinewith a sense of relief for which she blamed
herselfassented and supplied with letters of credit John Rex went to
Paris

Fairly started in the world of dissipation and excess he began to grow
reckless When a young man he had been singularly free from the vice of
drunkenness turning his sobrietyas he did all his virtuesto vicious
account but he had learnt to drink deep in the loneliness of the bush
Master of a large sum of money he had intended to spend it as he would
have spent it in his younger days He had forgotten that since his death
and burial the world had not grown younger It was possible that Mr
Lionel Crofton might have discovered some of the old set of fools
and knaves with whom he had once mixed Many of them were alive and
flourishing Mr Lemoine for instance was respectably married in his
native island of Jersey and had already threatened to disinherit a
nephew who showed a tendency to dissipation

But Mr Lemoine would not care to recognize Mr Lionel Crofton the
gambler and rake in his proper person and it was not expedient that
his acquaintance should be made in the person of Richard Devine lest
by some unlucky chance he should recognize the cheat Thus poor Lionel
Crofton was compelled to lie still in his grave and Mr Richard Devine
trusting to a big beard and more burly figure to keep his secret was
compelled to begin his friendship with Mr Lionels whilom friends all
over again In Paris and London there were plenty of people ready to
become hailfellowwellmet with any gentleman possessing money Mr
Richard Devines history was whispered in many a boudoir and clubroom
The history however was not always told in the same way It was
generally known that Lady Devine had a son who being supposed to be
dead had suddenly returned to the confusion of his family But the
manner of his return was told in many ways

In the first place Mr Francis Wade wellknown though he was did
not move in that brilliant circle which had lately received his nephew
There are in England many men of fortune as large as that left by the
old shipbuilder who are positively unknown in that little world which
is supposed to contain all the men worth knowing Francis Wade was a
man of mark in his own coterie Among artists bricabrac sellers
antiquarians and men of letters he was known as a patron and man
of taste His bankers and his lawyers knew him to be of independent
fortune but as he neither mixed in politics went into society
betted or speculated in merchandise there were several large sections
of the community who had never heard his name Many respectable
moneylenders would have required further information before they
would discount his bills and clubmen in generalsave perhaps
those ancient quidnuncs who know everybody from Adam downwardshad but
little acquaintance with him The advent of Mr Richard Devinea coarse
person of unlimited meanshad therefore chief influence upon that
sinister circle of male and female rogues who form the halfworld
They began to inquire concerning his antecedents and failing
satisfactory information to invent lies concerning him It was
generally believed that he was a black sheep a man whose family kept
him out of the way but who was in a pecuniary sense good for a
considerable sum

Thus taken upon trust Mr Richard Devine mixed in the very best of
bad society and had no lack of agreeable friends to help him to spend
money So admirably did he spend it that Francis Wade became at last
alarmed at the frequent drafts and urged his nephew to bring his
affairs to a final settlement Richard Devinein Paris Hamburg or
London or elsewherecould never be got to attack business and Mr
Francis Wade grew more and more anxious The poor gentleman
positively became ill through the anxiety consequent upon his nephews
dissipations I wish my dear Richard that you would let me know what
to do he wrote I wish my dear uncle that you would do what you
think best was his nephews reply

Will you let Purkiss and Quaid look into the business said the
badgered Francis

I hate lawyers said Richard Do what you think right

Mr Wade began to repent of his too easy taking of matters in the
beginning Not that he had a suspicion of Rex but that he had
remembered that Dick was always a loose fish The even current of the
dilettantes life became disturbed He grew pale and holloweyed His
digestion was impaired He ceased to take the interest in china which
the importance of that article demanded In a word he grew despondent
as to his fitness for his mission in life Lady Ellinor saw a change in
her brother He became morose peevish excitable She went privately
to the family doctor who shrugged his shoulders There is no danger
said he if he is kept quiet keep him quiet and he will live for
years but his father died of heart disease you know Lady Ellinor
upon this wrote a long letter to Mr Richard who was at Paris
repeated the doctors opinions and begged him to come over at once
Mr Richard replied that some horseracing matter of great importance
occupied his attention but that he would be at his rooms in Clarges
Street he had long ago established a town house on the 14th and would
go into matters I have lost a good deal of money lately my dear
mother said Mr Richard and the present will be a good opportunity
to make a final settlement The fact was that John Rex now three years
in undisturbed possession considered that the moment had arrived for
the execution of his grand coupthe carrying off at one swoop of the
whole of the fortune he had gambled for




CHAPTER III EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF THE REV JAMES NORTH



May 12thlanded today at Norfolk Island and have been introduced to
my new abode situated some eleven hundred miles from Sydney A solitary
rock in the tropical ocean the island seems indeed a fit place
of banishment It is about seven miles long and four broad The most
remarkable natural object is of course the Norfolk Island pine which
rears its stately head a hundred feet above the surrounding forest The
appearance of the place is very wild and beautiful bringing to my
mind the description of the romantic islands of the Pacific which old
geographers dwell upon so fondly Lemon lime and guava trees abound
also oranges grapes figs bananas peaches pomegranates and
pineapples The climate just now is hot and muggy The approach to
Kingstownas the barracks and huts are calledis properly difficult
A long low reefprobably originally a portion of the barren rocks
of Nepean and Philip Islands which rise east and west of the
settlementfronts the bay and obstructs the entrance of vessels We
were landed in boats through an opening in this reef and our vessel
stands on and off within signalling distance The surf washes almost
against the walls of the military roadway that leads to the barracks
The social aspect of the place fills me with horror There seems neither
discipline nor order On our way to the Commandants house we passed a
low dilapidated building where men were grinding maize and at the sight
of us they commenced whistling hooting and shouting using the most
disgusting language Three warders were near but no attempt was made to
check this unseemly exhibition



May 14thI sit down to write with as much reluctance as though I were
about to relate my experience of a journey through a sewer

First to the prisoners barracks which stand on an area of about three
acres surrounded by a lofty wall A road runs between this wall and
the sea The barracks are three storeys high and hold seven hundred and
ninety men let me remark here that there are more than two thousand men
on the island There are twentytwo wards in this place Each ward runs
the depth of the building viz eighteen feet and in consequence is
simply a funnel for hot or cold air to blow through When the ward is
filled the mens heads lie under the windows The largest ward contains
a hundred men the smallest fifteen They sleep in hammocks slung close
to each other as on board ship in two lines with a passage down
the centre There is a wardsman to each ward He is selected by the
prisoners and is generally a man of the worst character He is supposed
to keep order but of course he never attempts to do so indeed as he
is locked up in the ward every night from six oclock in the evening
until sunrise without light it is possible that he might get
maltreated did he make himself obnoxious

The barracks look upon the Barrack Square which is filled with lounging
prisoners The windows of the hospitalward also look upon Barrack
Square and the prisoners are in constant communication with the
patients The hospital is a low stone building capable of containing
about twenty men and faces the beach I placed my hands on the wall
and found it damp An ulcerous prisoner said the dampness was owing to
the heavy surf constantly rolling so close beneath the building There
are two gaols the old and the new The old gaol stands near the sea
close to the landingplace Outside it at the door is the Gallows I
touched it as I passed in This engine is the first thing which greets
the eyes of a newlyarrived prisoner The new gaol is barely completed
is of pentagonal shape and has eighteen radiating cells of a pattern
approved by some wiseacre in England who thinks that to prevent a man
from seeing his fellowmen is not the way to drive him mad In the old
gaol are twentyfour prisoners all heavily ironed awaiting trial by
the visiting Commission from Hobart Town Some of these poor ruffians
having committed their offences just after the last sitting of the
Commission have already been in gaol upwards of eleven months

At six oclock we saw the men mustered I read prayers before the
muster and was surprised to find that some of the prisoners attended
while some strolled about the yard whistling singing and joking
The muster is a farce The prisoners are not mustered outside and
then marched to their wards but they rush into the barracks
indiscriminately and place themselves dressed or undressed in their
hammocks A convict suboverseer then calls out the names and somebody
replies If an answer is returned to each name all is considered right
The lights are taken away and save for a few minutes at eight oclock
when the goodconduct men are let in the ruffians are left to their
own devices until morning Knowing what I know of the customs of the
convicts my heart sickens when I in imagination put myself in the place
of a newlytransported man plunged from six at night until daybreak
into that foetid den of worse than wild beasts



May 15thThere is a place enclosed between high walls adjoining the
convict barracks called the Lumber Yard This is where the prisoners
mess It is roofed on two sides and contains tables and benches Six
hundred men can mess here perhaps but as seven hundred are always
driven into it it follows that the weakest men are compelled to sit on
the ground A more disorderly sight than this yard at meal times I
never beheld The cookhouses are adjoining it and the men bake their
mealbread there Outside the cookhouse door the firewood is piled
and fires are made in all directions on the ground round which sit
the prisoners frying their rations of fresh pork baking their hominy
cakes chatting and even smoking

The Lumber Yard is a sort of Alsatia to which the hunted prisoner
retires I dont think the boldest constable on the island would venture
into that place to pick out a man from the seven hundred If he did go
in I dont think he would come out again alive



May 16thA suboverseer a man named Hankey has been talking to me
He says that there are some forty of the oldest and worst prisoners who
form what he calls the Ring and that the members of this Ring are
bound by oath to support each other and to avenge the punishment of any
of their number In proof of his assertions he instanced two cases
of English prisoners who had refused to join in some crime and had
informed the Commandant of the proceedings of the Ring They were found
in the morning strangled in their hammocks An inquiry was held but not
a man out of the ninety in the ward would speak a word I dread the task
that is before me How can I attempt to preach piety and morality to
these men How can I attempt even to save the less villainous



May 17thVisited the wards today and returned in despair The
condition of things is worse than I expected It is not to be written
The newlyarrived English prisonersand some of their histories
are most touchingare insulted by the language and demeanour of the
hardened miscreants who are the refuse of Port Arthur and Cockatoo
Island The vilest crimes are perpetrated as jests These are creatures
who openly defy authority whose language and conduct is such as was
never before seen or heard out of Bedlam There are men who are known
to have murdered their companions and who boast of it With these the
English farm labourer the riotous and ignorant mechanic the victim
of perjury or mistake are indiscriminately herded With them are mixed
Chinamen from Hong Kong the Aborigines of New Holland West Indian
blacks Greeks Caffres and Malays soldiers for desertion idiots
madmen pigstealers and pickpockets The dreadful place seems set
apart for all that is hideous and vile in our common nature In its
recklessness its insubordination its filth and its despair it
realizes to my mind the popular notion of Hell



May 21stEntered today officially upon my duties as Religious
Instructor at the Settlement

An occurrence took place this morning which shows the dangerous
condition of the Ring I accompanied Mr Pounce to the Lumber Yard
and on our entry we observed a man in the crowd round the cookhouse
deliberately smoking The Chief Constable of the Islandmy old friend
Troke of Port Arthurseeing that this exhibition attracted Pounces
notice pointed out the man to an assistant The assistant Jacob
Gimblett advanced and desired the prisoner to surrender the pipe The
man plunged his hands into his pockets and with a gesture of the most
profound contempt walked away to that part of the messshed where the
Ring congregate

Take the scoundrel to gaol cried Troke

No one moved but the man at the gate that leads through the carpenters
shop into the barracks called to us to come out saying that the
prisoners would never suffer the man to be taken Pounce however with
more determination than I gave him credit for kept his ground and
insisted that so flagrant a breach of discipline should not be suffered
to pass unnoticed Thus urged Mr Troke pushed through the crowd and
made for the spot whither the man had withdrawn himself

The yard was buzzing like a disturbed hive and I momentarily expected
that a rush would be made upon us In a few moments the prisoner
appeared attended by rather than in the custody of the Chief
Constable of the island He advanced to the unlucky assistant constable
who was standing close to me and asked What have you ordered me to
gaol for The man made some reply advising him to go quietly when the
convict raised his fist and deliberately felled the man to the ground
You had better retire gentlemen said Troke I see them getting out
their knives

We made for the gate and the crowd closed in like a sea upon the two
constables I fully expected murder but in a few moments Troke and
Gimblett appeared borne along by a mass of men dusty but unharmed
and having the convict between them He sulkily raised a hand as he
passed me either to rectify the position of his straw hat or to offer
a tardy apology A more wanton unprovoked and flagrant outrage than
that of which this man was guilty I never witnessed It is customary for
the old dogs as the experienced convicts are called to use the
most opprobrious language to their officers and to this a deaf ear
is usually turned but I never before saw a man wantonly strike a
constable I fancy that the act was done out of bravado Troke informed
me that the mans name is Rufus Dawes and that he is the leader of the
Ring and considered the worst man on the island that to secure him he
Troke was obliged to use the language of expostulation and that but
for the presence of an officer accredited by his Excellency he dared
not have acted as he had done

This is the same man then whom I injured at Port Arthur Seven years
of discipline dont seem to have done him much good His sentence is
lifea lifetime in this place Troke says that he was the terror
of Port Arthur and that they sent him here when a weeding of the
prisoners was made He has been here four years Poor wretch



May 24thAfter prayers I saw Dawes He was confined in the Old Gaol
and seven others were in the cell with him He came out at my request
and stood leaning against the doorpost He was much changed from the
man I remember Seven years ago he was a stalwart upright handsome
man He has become a beetlebrowed sullen slouching ruffian His hair
is grey though he cannot be more than forty years of age and his
frame has lost that just proportion of parts which once made him
almost graceful His face has also grown like other convict faceshow
hideously alike they all areand save for his black eyes and a
peculiar trick he had of compressing his lips I should not have
recognized him How habitual sin and misery suffice to brutalize the
human face divine I said but little for the other prisoners were
listening eager as it appeared to me to witness my discomfiture
It is evident that Rufus Dawes had been accustomed to meet the
ministrations of my predecessors with insolence I spoke to him for
a few minutes only saying how foolish it was to rebel against an
authority superior in strength to himself He did not answer and the
only emotion he evinced during the interview was when I reminded him
that we had met before He shrugged one shoulder as if in pain or
anger and seemed about to speak but casting his eyes upon the group
in the cell relapsed into silence again I must get speech with him
alone One can do nothing with a man if seven other devils worse than
himself are locked up with him

I sent for Hankey and asked him about cells He says that the gaol is
crowded to suffocation Solitary confinement is a mere name There are
six men each sentenced to solitary confinement in a cell together The
cell is called the nunnery It is small and the six men were naked to
the waist when I entered the perspiration pouring in streams off their
naked bodies It is disgusting to write of such things



June 26thPounce has departed in the Lady Franklin for Hobart Town
and it is rumoured that we are to have a new Commandant The Lady
Franklin is commanded by an old man named Blunt a protege of Freres
and a fellow to whom I have taken one of my inexplicable and unreasoning
dislikes

Saw Rufus Dawes this morning He continues sullen and morose His papers
are very bad He is perpetually up for punishment I am informed that
he and a man named Eastwood nicknamed Jacky Jacky glory in being the
leaders of the Ring and that they openly avow themselves weary of life
Can it be that the unmerited flogging which the poor creature got at
Port Arthur has aided with other sufferings to bring him to this
horrible state of mind It is quite possible Oh James North remember
your own crime and pray Heaven to let you redeem one soul at least to
plead for your own at the Judgment Seat



June 30thI took a holiday this afternoon and walked in the direction
of Mount Pitt The island lay at my feet likeas sings Mrs Freres
favourite poeta summer isle of Eden lying in dark purple sphere of
sea Sophocles has the same idea in the Philoctetes but I cant
quote it Note I measured a pine twentythree feet in circumference
I followed a little brook that runs from the hills and winds through
thick undergrowths of creeper and blossom until it reaches a lovely
valley surrounded by lofty trees whose branches linked together by the
luxurious grapevine form an arching bower of verdure Here stands the
ruin of an old hut formerly inhabited by the early settlers lemons
figs and guavas are thick while amid the shrub and cane a large
convolvulus is entwined and stars the green with its purple and crimson
flowers I sat down here and had a smoke It seems that the former
occupant of my rooms at the settlement read French for in searching
for a book to bring with meI never walk without a bookI found and
pocketed a volume of Balzac It proved to be a portion of the Vie Privee
series and I stumbled upon a story called La Fausse Maitresse
With calm belief in the Paris of his imaginationwhere Marcas was a
politician Nucingen a banker Gobseck a moneylender and Vautrin a
candidate for some such place as thisBalzac introduces me to a Pole by
name Paz who loving the wife of his friend devotes himself to watch
over her happiness and her husbands interest The husband gambles and
is profligate Paz informs the wife that the leanness which hazard
and debauchery have caused to the domestic exchequer is due to his
extravagance the husband having lent him money She does not believe
and Paz feigns an intrigue with a circusrider in order to lull all
suspicions She says to her adored spouse Get rid of this extravagant
friend Away with him He is a profligate a gambler A drunkard
Paz finally departs and when he has gone the lady finds out the poor
Poles worth The story does not end satisfactorily Balzac was too
great a master of his art for that In real life the curtain never falls
on a comfortablyfinished drama The play goes on eternally

I have been thinking of the story all evening A man who loves his
friends wife and devotes his energies to increase her happiness by
concealing from her her husbands follies Surely none but Balzac
would have hit upon such a notion A man who loves his friends
wifeAsmodeus I write no more I have ceased to converse with thee
for so long that I blush to confess all that I have in my heartI will
not confess it so that shall suffice




CHAPTER IV EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF THE REV JAMES NORTH



August 24thThere has been but one entry in my journal since the 30th
June that which records the advent of our new Commandant who as I
expected is Captain Maurice Frere

So great have been the changes which have taken place that I
scarcely know how to record them Captain Frere has realized my worst
anticipations He is brutal vindictive and domineering His knowledge
of prisons and prisoners gives him an advantage over Burgess otherwise
he much resembles that murderous animal He has but one thoughtto keep
the prisoners in subjection So long as the island is quiet he cares
not whether the men live or die I was sent down here to keep order
said he to me a few days after his arrival and by God sir Ill do
it

He has done it I must admit but at a cost of a legacy of hatred to
himself that he may some day regret to have earned He has organized
three parties of police One patrols the fields one is on guard at
stores and public buildings and the third is employed as a detective
force There are two hundred soldiers on the island And the officer
in charge Captain McNab has been induced by Frere to increase their
duties in many ways The cords of discipline are suddenly drawn tight
For the disorder which prevailed when I landed Frere has substituted a
sudden and excessive rigour Any officer found giving the smallest
piece of tobacco to a prisoner is liable to removal from the islandThe
tobacco which grows wild has been rooted up and destroyed lest the men
should obtain a leaf of it The privilege of having a pannikin of hot
water when the gangs came in from field labour in the evening has been
withdrawn The shepherds hutkeepers and all other prisoners whether
at the stations of Longridge or the Cascades where the English convicts
are stationed are forbidden to keep a parrot or any other bird The
plaiting of straw hats during the prisoners leisure hours is also
prohibited At the settlement where the old hands are located railed
boundaries have been erected beyond which no prisoner must pass unless
to work Two days ago Job Dodd a negro let his jacket fall over the
boundary rails crossed them to recover it and was severely flogged
The floggings are hideously frequent On flogging mornings I have seen
the ground where the men stood at the triangles saturated with blood as
if a bucket of blood had been spilled on it covering a space three feet
in diameter and running out in various directions in little streams
two or three feet long At the same time let me say with that strict
justice I force myself to mete out to those whom I dislike that the
island is in a condition of abject submission There is not much chance
of mutiny The men go to their work without a murmur and slink to their
dormitories like whipped hounds to kennel The gaols and solitary 
cells are crowded with prisoners and each day sees fresh sentences for
fresh crimes It is crime here to do anything but live

The method by which Captain Frere has brought about this repose of
desolation is characteristic of him He sets every man as a spy upon
his neighbour awes the more daring into obedience by the display of
a ruffianism more outrageous than their own and raising the worst
scoundrels in the place to office compels them to find cases
for punishment Perfidy is rewarded It has been made part of a
convictpolicemans duty to search a fellowprisoner anywhere and at
any time This searching is often conducted in a wantonly rough and
disgusting manner and if resistance be offered the man resisting can
be knocked down by a blow from the searchers bludgeon Inquisitorial
vigilance and indiscriminating harshness prevail everywhere and the
lives of hundreds of prisoners are reduced to a continual agony of
terror and selfloathing

It is impossible Captain Frere said I one day during the initiation
of this system to think that these villains whom you have made
constables will do their duty

He replied They must do their duty If they are indulgent to the
prisoners they know I shall flog em If they do what I tell em
theyll make themselves so hated that theyd have their own father up to
the triangles to save themselves being sent back to the ranks

You treat them then like slavekeepers of a wild beast den They must
flog the animals to avoid being flogged themselves

Ay said he with his coarse laugh and having once flogged em
theyd do anything rather than be put in the cage dont you see

It is horrible to think of this sort of logic being used by a man who
has a wife and friends and enemies It is the logic that the Keeper
of the Tormented would use I should think I am sick unto death of the
place It makes me an unbeliever in the social charities It takes out
of penal science anything it may possess of nobility or worth It is
cruel debasing inhuman



August 26thSaw Rufus Dawes again today His usual bearing
is ostentatiously rough and brutal He has sunk to a depth of
selfabasement in which he takes a delight in his degradation This
condition is one familiar to me

He is working in the chaingang to which Hankey was made suboverseer
Blind Mooney an ophthalmic prisoner who was removed from the gang
to hospital told me that there was a plot to murder Hankey but that
Dawes to whom he had shown some kindness had prevented it I saw
Hankey and told him of this asking him if he had been aware of the
plot He said No falling into a great tremble Major Pratt promised
me a removal said he I expected it would come to this I asked him
why Dawes defended him and after some trouble he told me exacting from
me a promise that I would not acquaint the Commandant It seems that one
morning last week Hankey had gone up to Captain Freres house with
a return from Troke and coming back through the garden had plucked a
flower Dawes had asked him for this flower offering two days rations
for it Hankey who is not a badhearted man gave him the sprig There
were tears in his eyes as he took it said he

There must be some way to get at this mans heart bad as he seems to
be



August 28thHankey was murdered yesterday He applied to be removed
from the gaolgang but Frere refused I never let my men funk he
said If theyve threatened to murder you Ill keep you there another
month in spite of em

Someone who overheard this reported it to the gang and they set upon
the unfortunate gaoler yesterday and beat his brains out with their
shovels Troke says that the wretch who was foremost cried Theres for
you and if your master dont take care hell get served the same one
of these days The gang were employed at building a reef in the sea
and were working up to their armpits in water Hankey fell into the
surf and never moved after the first blow I saw the gang and Dawes
said

It was Freres fault he should have let the man go

I am surprised you did not interfere said I I did all I could was
the mans answer Whats a life more or less here

This occurrence has spread consternation among the overseers and they
have addressed a round robin to the Commandant praying to be relieved
from their positions

The way Frere has dealt with this petition is characteristic of him and
fills me at once with admiration and disgust He came down with it in
his hand to the gaolgang walked into the yard shut the gate and
said Ive just got this from my overseers They say theyre afraid
youll murder them as you murdered Hankey Now if you want to murder
murder me Here I am Step out one of you All this said in a tone
of the most galling contempt did not move them I saw a dozen pairs
of eyes flash hatred but the bulldog courage of the man overawed them
here as I am told it had done in Sydney It would have been easy to
kill him then and there and his death I am told is sworn among them
but no one raised a finger The only man who moved was Rufus Dawes and
he checked himself instantly Frere with a recklessness of which I did
not think him capable stepped up to this terror of the prison and ran
his hands lightly down his sides as is the custom with constables when
searching a man Daweswho is of a fierce temperturned crimson
at this and I thought would have struck him but he did not Frere
thenstill unarmed and aloneproceeded to the man saying Do you
think of bolting again Dawes Have you made any more boats

You Devil said the chained man in a voice pregnant with such weight
of unborn murder that the gang winced Youll find me one said
Frere with a laugh and turning to me continued in the same jesting
tone Theres a penitent for you Mr Northtry your hand on him

I was speechless at his audacity and must have shown my disgust in
my face for he coloured slightly and as we were leaving the yard he
endeavoured to excuse himself by saying that it was no use preaching to
stones and such doublydyed villains as this Dawes were past hope I
know the ruffian of old said he He came out in the ship from England
with me and tried to raise a mutiny on board He was the man who nearly
murdered my wife He has never been out of ironsexcept then and
when he escapedfor the last eighteen years and as hes three life
sentences hes like to die in em

A monstrous wretch and criminal evidently and yet I feel a strange
sympathy with this outcast




CHAPTER V MR RICHARD DEVINE SURPRISED



The town house of Mr Richard Devine was in Clarges Street Not that the
very modest mansion there situated was the only establishment of which
Richard Devine was master Mr John Rex had expensive tastes He neither
shot nor hunted so he had no capital invested in Scotch moors or
Leicestershire huntingboxes But his stables were the wonder of London
he owned almost a racing village near Doncaster kept a yacht at Cowes
and in addition to a house in Paris paid the rent of a villa at
Brompton He belonged to several clubs of the faster sort and might
have lived like a prince at any one of them had he been so minded but
a constant and haunting fear of discoverywhich three years of
unquestioned ease and unbridled riot had not dispelledled him to
prefer the privacy of his own house where he could choose his own
society The house in Clarges Street was decorated in conformity with
the tastes of its owner The pictures were pictures of horses the books
were records of races or novels purporting to describe sporting life
Mr Francis Wade waiting on the morning of the 20th April for the
coming of his nephew sighed as he thought of the cultured quiet of
North End House

Mr Richard appeared in his dressinggown Three years of good living
and hard drinking had deprived his figure of its athletic beauty He
was past forty years of age and the sudden cessation from severe bodily
toil to which in his active life as a convict and squatter he had been
accustomed had increased Rexs natural proneness to fat and instead
of being portly he had become gross His cheeks were inflamed with the
frequent application of hot and rebellious liquors to his blood His
hands were swollen and not so steady as of yore His whiskers were
streaked with unhealthy grey His eyes bright and black as ever lurked
in a thicket of crows feet He had become prematurely balda sure
sign of mental or bodily excess He spoke with assumed heartiness in a
boisterous tone of affected ease

Ha ha My dear uncle sit down Delighted to see you Have you
breakfastedof course you have I was up rather late last night Quite
sure you wont have anything A glass of wine Nothen sit down and
tell me all the news of Hampstead

Thank you Richard said the old gentleman a little stiffly but
I want some serious talk with you What do you intend to do with the
property This indecision worries me Either relieve me of my trust or
be guided by my advice

Well the fact is said Richard with a very ugly look on his face
the fact isand you may as well know it at onceI am much pushed for
money

Pushed for money cried Mr Wade in horror Why Purkiss said the
property was worth twenty thousand a year

So it might have beenfive years agobut my horseracing and
betting and other amusements concerning which you need not too
curiously inquire have reduced its value considerably

He spoke recklessly and roughly It was evident that success had but
developed his ruffianism His dandyism was only comparative The
impulse of poverty and scheming which led him to affect the gentleman
having been removed the natural brutality of his nature showed itself
quite freely Mr Francis Wade took a pinch of snuff with a sharp motion
of distaste I do not want to hear of your debaucheries he said our
name has been sufficiently disgraced in my hearing

What is got over the devils back goes under his belly replied Mr
Richard coarsely My old father got his money by dirtier ways than
these in which I spend it As villainous an old scoundrel and skinflint
as ever poisoned a seaman Ill go bail

Mr Francis rose You need not revile your father Richardhe left you
all

Ay but by pure accident He didnt mean it If he hadnt died in the
nick of time that unhung murderous villain Maurice Frere would have
come in for it By the way he added with a change of tone do you
ever hear anything of Maurice

I have not heard for some years said Mr Wade He is something in
the Convict Department at Sydney I think Is he said Mr Richard
with a shiver Hope hell stop there Well but about business The
fact is thatthat I am thinking of selling everything

Selling everything

Yes Pon my soul I am The Hampstead place and all

Sell North End House cried poor Mr Wade in bewilderment Youd
sell it Why the carvings by Grinling Gibbons are the finest in
England

I cant help that laughed Mr Richard ringing the bell I want
cash and cash I must haveBreakfast SmithersIm going to travel

Francis Wade was breathless with astonishment Educated and reared as he
had been he would as soon have thought of proposing to sell St Pauls
Cathedral as to sell the casket which held his treasures of arthis
coins his coffeecups his pictures and his proofs before letters

Surely Richard you are not in earnest he gasped

I am indeed

Butbut who will buy it

Plenty of people I shall cut it up into building allotments Besides
they are talking of a suburban line with a terminus at St Johns
Wood which will cut the garden in half You are quite sure youve
breakfasted Then pardon me

Richard you are jesting with me You will never let them do such a
thing

Im thinking of a trip to America said Mr Richard cracking an
egg I am sick of Europe After all what is the good of a man like
me pretending to belong to an old family with a seat and all that
humbug Money is the thing now my dear uncle Hard cash Thats the
ticket for soup you may depend

Then what do you propose doing sir

To buy my mothers life interest as provided realize upon the
property and travel said Mr Richard helping himself to potted
grouse

You amaze me Richard You confound me Of course you can
do as you please But so sudden a determination The old
housevasescoinspicturesscatteredI reallyWell it is your
property of courseandandI wish you a very good morning

I mean to do as I please soliloquized Rex as he resumed his
breakfast Let him sell his rubbish by auction and go and live abroad
in Germany or Jerusalem if he likes the farther the better for me Ill
sell the property and make myself scarce A trip to America will benefit
my health

A knock at the door made him start

Come in Curse it how nervous Im getting Whats that Letters Give
them to me and why the devil dont you put the brandy on the table
Smithers

He drank some of the spirit greedily and then began to open his
correspondence

Cussed brute said Mr Smithers outside the door He couldnt use
wuss langwidge if he was a dook dam imYessir he added suddenly
as a roar from his master recalled him

When did this come asked Mr Richard holding out a letter more than
usually disfigured with stampings

Lars night sir Its bin to Amstead sir and come down directed with
the hothers The angry glare of the black eyes induced him to add I
ope theres nothink wrong sir

Nothing you infernal ass and idiot burst out Mr Richard white with
rage except that I should have had this instantly Cant you see its
marked urgent Can you read Can you spell There that will do No
lies Get out

Left to himself again Mr Richard walked hurriedly up and down the
chamber wiped his forehead drank a tumbler of brandy and finally sat
down and reread the letter It was short but terribly to the purpose



THE GEORGE HOTEL PLYMOUTH 17th April 1846

MY DEAR JACK

I have found you out you see Never mind how just at present I know
all about your proceedings and unless Mr Richard Devine receives his
wife with due propriety hell find himself in the custody of the
police Telegraph dear to Mrs Richard Devine at above address

Yours as ever Jack

SARAH

To Richard Devine Esq North End House Hampstead



The blow was unexpected and severe It was hard in the very high tide
and flush of assured success to be thus plucked back into the old
bondage Despite the affectionate tone of the letter he knew the woman
with whom he had to deal For some furious minutes he sat motionless
gazing at the letter He did not speakmen seldom do under such
circumstancesbut his thoughts ran in this fashion Here is this
cursed woman again Just as I was congratulating myself on my freedom
How did she discover me Small use asking that What shall I do I can
do nothing It is absurd to run away for I shall be caught Besides
Ive no money My account at Mastermanns is overdrawn two thousand
pounds If I bolt at all I must bolt at oncewithin twentyfour hours
Rich as I am I dont suppose I could raise more than five thousand
pounds in that time These things take a day or two say fortyeight
hours In fortyeight hours I could raise twenty thousand pounds but
fortyeight hours is too long Curse the woman I know her How in the
fiends name did she discover me Its a bad job However shes not
inclined to be gratuitiously disagreeable How lucky I never married

infernal Eaglehawk Neck if it hadnt been for her She is not a bad
sort Handsome woman too I may make it up with her I shall have to

CHAPTER VI IN WHICH THE CHAPLAIN IS TAKEN ILL


Though the house of the Commandant of Norfolk Island was comfortable and
well furnished and though of necessity all that was most hideous in
the discipline of the place was hidden the loathing with which Sylvia
had approached the last and most dreaded abiding place of the elaborate
convict system under which it had been her misfortune to live had not
decreased The sights and sounds of pain and punishment surrounded her
She could not look out of her windows without a shudder She dreaded
each evening when her husband returned lest he should blurt out some
new atrocity She feared to ask him in the morning whither he was
going lest he should thrill her with the announcement of some fresh
punishment

I wish Maurice we had never come here said she piteously when he
recounted to her the scene of the gaolgang These unhappy men will do
you some frightful injury one of these days

Stuff said her husband Theyve not the courage Id take the best
man among them and dare him to touch me

I cannot think how you like to witness so much misery and villainy It
is horrible to think of

Our tastes differ my dearJenkins Confound you Jenkins I say
The convictservant entered Where is the chargebook Ive told you
always to have it ready for me Why dont you do as you are told You
idle lazy scoundrel I suppose you were yarning in the cookhouse or

If you please sir

Dont answer me sir Give me the book Taking it and running his
finger down the leaves he commented on the list of offences to which he
would be called upon in the morning to mete out judgment

Meeraseek having a pipethe rascally Hindoo scoundrelBenjamin
Pellett having fat in his possession Miles Byrne not walking fast
enoughWe must enliven Mr Byrne Thomas Twist having a pipe and
striking a light W Barnes not in place at muster says he was
washing himselfIll wash him John Richards missing muster and
insolence John Gateby insolence and insubordination James Hopkins
insolence and foul language Rufus Dawes gross insolence refusing to
workAh we must look after you You are a parsons man now are you
Ill break your spirit my man or IllSylvia

Yes

Your friend Dawes is doing credit to his bringing up

What do you mean

That infernal villain and reprobate Dawes He is fitting himself
faster for She interrupted him Maurice I wish you would not use
such language You know I dislike it She spoke coldly and sadly
as one who knows that remonstrance is vain and is yet constrained to
remonstrate

Oh dear My Lady Proper cant bear to hear her husband swear How
refined were getting

There I did not mean to annoy you said she wearily Dont let us
quarrel for goodness sake

He went away noisily and she sat looking at the carpet wearily A noise
roused her She looked up and saw North Her face beamed instantly Ah
Mr North I did not expect you What brings you here Youll stay to
dinner of course She rang the bell without waiting for a reply
Mr North dines here place a chair for him And have you brought me
the book I have been looking for it

Here it is said North producing a volume of Monte Cristo She
seized the book with avidity and after running her eyes over the
pages turned inquiringly to the flyleaf

It belongs to my predecessor said North as though in answer to her
thought He seems to have been a great reader of French I have found
many French novels of his

I thought clergymen never read French novels said Sylvia with a
smile

There are French novels and French novels said North Stupid people
confound the good with the bad I remember a worthy friend of mine in
Sydney who soundly abused me for reading Rabelais and when I asked
him if he had read it he said that he would sooner cut his hand off
than open it Admirable judge of its merits

But is this really good Papa told me it was rubbish

It is a romance but in my opinion a very fine one The notion of
the sailor being taught in prison by the priest and sent back into the
world an accomplished gentleman to work out his vengeance is superb

No nowyou are telling me laughed she and then with feminine
perversity Go on what is the story

Only that of an unjustly imprisoned man who escaping by a marvel
and becoming richas Dr Johnson says beyond the dreams of
avaricedevotes his life and fortune to revenge himself

And does he

He does upon all his enemies save one

And he Shewas the wife of his greatest enemy and Dantes spared
her because he loved her

Sylvia turned away her head It seems interesting enough said she
coldly

There was an awkward silence for a moment which each seemed afraid to
break North bit his lips as though regretting what he had said Mrs
Frere beat her foot on the floor and at length raising her eyes and
meeting those of the clergyman fixed upon her face rose hurriedly and
went to meet her returning husband

Come to dinner of course said Frere who though he disliked the
clergyman yet was glad of anybody who would help him to pass a cheerful
evening

I came to bring Mrs Frere a book

Ah She reads too many books shes always reading books It is not a
good thing to be always poring over print is it North You have some
influence with her tell her so Come I am hungry

He spoke with that affectation of jollity with which husbands of his
calibre veil their bad temper

Sylvia had her defensive armour on in a twinkling Of course you two
men will be against me When did two men ever disagree upon the subject
of wifely duties However I shall read in spite of you Do you know
Mr North that when I married I made a special agreement with Captain
Frere that I was not to be asked to sew on buttons for him

Indeed said North not understanding this change of humour

And she never has from that hour said Frere recovering his suavity
at the sight of food I never have a shirt fit to put on Upon my word
there are a dozen in the drawer now

North perused his plate uncomfortably A saying of omniscient Balzac
occurred to him Le grand ecueil est le ridicule and his mind began
to sound all sorts of philosophical depths not of the most clerical
character

After dinner Maurice launched out into his usual topicconvict
discipline It was pleasant for him to get a listener for his wife
cold and unsympathetic tacitly declined to enter into his schemes for
the subduing of the refractory villains You insisted on coming here
she would say I did not wish to come I dont like to talk of these
things Let us talk of something else When she adopted this method
of procedure he had no alternative but to submit for he was afraid of
her after a fashion In this illassorted match he was only apparently
the master He was a physical tyrant For him a creature had but to be
weak to be an object of contempt and his gross nature triumphed over
the finer one of his wife Love had long since died out of their life
The young impulsive delicate girl who had given herself to him seven
years before had been changed into a weary suffering woman The wife
is what her husband makes her and his rude animalism had made her
the nervous invalid she was Instead of love he had awakened in her a
distaste which at times amounted to disgust We have neither the skill
nor the boldness of that profound philosopher whose autopsy of the human
heart awoke Norths contemplation and we will not presume to set forth
in bare English the story of this marriage of the Minotaur Let it
suffice to say that Sylvia liked her husband least when he loved her
most In this repulsion lay her power over him When the animal and
spiritual natures cross each other the nobler triumphs in fact if not
in appearance Maurice Frere though his wife obeyed him knew that he
was inferior to her and was afraid of the statue he had created She
was ice but it was the artificial ice that chemists make in the midst
of a furnace Her coldness was at once her strength and her weakness
When she chilled him she commanded him

Unwitting of the thoughts that possessed his guest Frere chatted
amicably North said little but drank a good deal The wine however
rendered him silent instead of talkative He drank that he might forget
unpleasant memories and drank without accomplishing his object When
the pair proceeded to the room where Mrs Frere awaited them Frere was
boisterously goodhumoured North silently misanthropic

Sing something Sylvia said Frere with the ease of possession as
one who should say to a living musicalbox Play something

Oh Mr North doesnt care for music and Im not inclined to sing
Singing seems out of place here

Nonsense said Frere Why should it be more out of place here than
anywhere else

Mrs Frere means that mirth is in a manner unsuited to these melancholy
surroundings said North out of his keener sense

Melancholy surroundings cried Frere staring in turn at the piano
the ottomans and the lookingglass Well the house isnt as good as
the one in Sydney but its comfortable enough

You dont understand me Maurice said Sylvia This place is very
gloomy to me The thought of the unhappy men who are ironed and chained
all about us makes me miserable

What stuff said Frere now thoroughly roused The ruffians deserve
all they get and more Why should you make yourself wretched about
them

Poor men How do we know the strength of their temptation the
bitterness of their repentance

Evildoers earn their punishment says North in a hard voice and
taking up a book suddenly They must learn to bear it No repentance
can undo their sin

But surely there is mercy for the worst of evildoers urged Sylvia
gently

North seemed disinclined or unable to reply and nodded only

Mercy cried Frere I am not here to be merciful I am here to keep
these scoundrels in order and by the Lord that made me Ill do it

Maurice do not talk like that Think how slight an accident might
have made any one of us like one of these men What is the matter Mr
North

Mr North has suddenly turned pale

Nothing returned the clergyman gaspinga sudden faintness The
windows were thrown open and the chaplain gradually recovered as he
did in Burgesss parlour at Port Arthur seven years ago I am liable
to these attacks A touch of heart disease I think I shall have to
rest for a day or so Ah take a spell said Frere you overwork
yourself

North sitting gasping and pale smiles in a ghastly manner II
will If I do not appear for a week Mrs Frere you will know the
reason

A week Surely it will not last so long as that exclaims Sylvia

The ambiguous it appears to annoy him for he flushes painfully
replying Sometimes longer It is aumuncertain in a confused and
shamefaced manner and is luckily relieved by the entry of Jenkins

A message from Mr Troke sir

Troke Whats the matter now

Dawes sir s been violent and assaulted Mr Troke Mr Troke
said youd left orders to be told at onst of the insubordination of
prisoners

Quite right Where is he In the cells I think sir They had a hard
fight to get him there I am told your honour

Had they Give my compliments to Mr Troke and tell him that I shall
have the pleasure of breaking Mr Dawess spirit tomorrow morning at
nine sharp

Maurice said Sylvia who had been listening to the conversation in
undisguised alarm do me a favour Do not torment this man

What makes you take a fancy to him asks her husband with sudden
unnecessary fierceness

Because his is one of the names which have been from my childhood
synonymous with suffering and torture because whatever wrong he may
have done his lifelong punishment must have in some degree atoned for
it

She spoke with an eager pity in her face that transfigured it North
devouring her with his glance saw tears in her eyes Does this look as
if he had made atonement said Frere coarsely slapping the letter

He is a bad man I know but she passed her hand over her forehead
with the old troubled gesturehe cannot have been always bad I think
I have heard some good of him somewhere

Nonsense said Frere rising decisively Your fancies mislead you
Let me hear you no more The man is rebellious and must be lashed back
again to his duty Come North well have a nip before you start

Mr North will not you plead for me suddenly cried poor Sylvia her
selfpossession overthrown You have a heart to pity these suffering
creatures

But North who seemed to have suddenly recalled his soul from some place
where it had been wandering draws himself aside and with dry lips
makes shift to say I cannot interfere with your husband madam and
goes out almost rudely

Youve made old North quite ill said Frere when he byandby
returns hoping by bluff ignoring of roughness on his own part to avoid
reproach from his wife He drank half a bottle of brandy to steady
his nerves before he went home and swung out of the house like one
possessed

But Sylvia occupied with her own thoughts did not reply




CHAPTER VII BREAKING A MANS SPIRIT



The insubordination of which Rufus Dawes had been guilty was in
this instance insignificant It was the custom of the newlyfledged
constables of Captain Frere to enter the wards at night armed with
cutlasses tramping about and making a great noise Mindful of the
report of Pounce they pulled the men roughly from their hammocks
examined their persons for concealed tobacco and compelled them to open
their mouths to see if any was inside The men in Dawess gangto which
Mr Troke had an especial objectionwere often searched more than once
in a night searched going to work searched at meals searched going
to prayers searched coming out and this in the roughest manner Their
sleep broken and what little selfrespect they might yet presume to
retain harried out of them the objects of this incessant persecution
were ready to turn upon and kill their tormentors

The great aim of Troke was to catch Dawes tripping but the leader of
the Ring was far too wary In vain had Troke eager to sustain his
reputation for sharpness burst in upon the convict at all times and
seasons He had found nothing In vain had he laid traps for him in
vain had he planted figs of tobacco and attached long threads to
them waited in a bush hard by until the pluck at the end of his line
should give token that the fish had bitten The experienced old hand
was too acute for him Filled with disgust and ambition he determined
upon an ingenious little trick He was certain that Dawes possessed
tobacco the thing was to find it upon him Now Rufus Dawes holding
aloof as was his custom from the majority of his companions had made
one friendif so mindless and battered an old wreck could be called a
friendBlind Mooney Perhaps this oddlyassorted friendship was brought
about by two causesone that Mooney was the only man on the island who
knew more of the horrors of convictism than the leader of the Ring the
other that Mooney was blind and to a moody sullen man subject
to violent fits of passion and a constant suspicion of all his
fellowcreatures a blind companion was more congenial than a sharpeyed
one

Mooney was one of the First Fleeters He had arrived in Sydney
fiftyseven years before in the year 1789 and when he was transported
he was fourteen years old He had been through the whole round of
servitude had worked as a bondsman had married and been up country
had been again sentenced and was a sort of dismal patriarch of Norfolk
Island having been there at its former settlement He had no friends
His wife was long since dead and he stated without contradiction
that his master having taken a fancy to her had despatched the
uncomplaisant husband to imprisonment Such cases were not uncommon

One of the many ways in which Rufus Dawes had obtained the affection
of the old blind man was a gift of such fragments of tobacco as he had
himself from time to time secured Troke knew this and on the evening
in question hit upon an excellent plan Admitting himself noiselessly
into the boatshed where the gang slept he crept close to the sleeping
Dawes and counterfeiting Mooneys mumbling utterance asked for some
tobacco Rufus Dawes was but half awake and on repeating his request
Troke felt something put into his hand He grasped Dawess arm and
struck a light He had got his man this time Dawes had conveyed to his
fancied friend a piece of tobacco almost as big as the top joint of his
little finger One can understand the feelings of a man entrapped by
such base means Rufus Dawes no sooner saw the hated face of Warder
Troke peering over his hammock then he sprang out and exerting to the
utmost his powerful muscles knocked Mr Troke fairly off his legs into
the arms of the incoming constables A desperate struggle took place
at the end of which the convict overpowered by numbers was borne
senseless to the cells gagged and chained to the ringbolt on the bare
flags While in this condition he was savagely beaten by five or six
constables

To this maimed and manacled rebel was the Commandant ushered by Troke
the next morning

Ha ha my man said the Commandant Here you are again you see How
do you like this sort of thing

Dawes glaring makes no answer

You shall have fifty lashes my man said Frere Well see how you
feel then The fifty were duly administered and the Commandant called
the next day The rebel was still mute

Give him fifty more Mr Troke Well see what hes made of

One hundred and twenty lashes were inflicted in the course of the
morning but still the sullen convict refused to speak He was then
treated to fourteen days solitary confinement in one of the new cells
On being brought out and confronted with his tormentor he merely
laughed For this he was sent back for another fourteen days and still
remaining obdurate was flogged again and got fourteen days more
Had the chaplain then visited him he might have found him open to
consolation but the chaplainso it was statedwas sick When brought
out at the conclusion of his third confinement he was found to be in so
exhausted a condition that the doctor ordered him to hospital As soon
as he was sufficiently recovered Frere visited him and finding his
spirit not yet broken ordered that he should be put to grind maize
Dawes declined to work So they chained his hand to one arm of the
grindstone and placed another prisoner at the other arm As the second
prisoner turned the hand of Dawes of course revolved

Youre not such a pebble as folks seemed to think grinned Frere
pointing to the turning wheel

Upon which the indomitable poor devil straightened his sorelytried
muscles and prevented the wheel from turning at all Frere gave him
fifty more lashes and sent him the next day to grind cayenne pepper
This was a punishment more dreaded by the convicts than any other
The pungent dust filled their eyes and lungs causing them the most
excruciating torments For a man with a raw back the work was one
continued agony In four days Rufus Dawes emaciated blistered
blinded broke down

For Gods sake Captain Frere kill me at once he said

No fear said the other rejoiced at this proof of his power Youve
given in thats all I wanted Troke take him off to the hospital

When he was in hospital North visited him

I would have come to see you before said the clergyman but I have
been very ill

In truth he looked so He had had a fever it seemed and they had
shaved his beard and cropped his hair Dawes could see that the
haggard wasted man had passed through some agony almost as great as his
own The next day Frere visited him complimented him on his courage
and offered to make him a constable Dawes turned his scarred back to
his torturer and resolutely declined to answer

I am afraid you have made an enemy of the Commandant said North the
next day Why not accept his offer

Dawes cast on him a glance of quiet scorn And betray my mates Im not
one of that sort

The clergyman spoke to him of hope of release of repentance and
redemption The prisoner laughed Whos to redeem me he said
expressing his thoughts in phraseology that to ordinary folks might seem
blasphemous It would take a Christ to die again to save such as I

North spoke to him of immortality There is another life said he Do
not risk your chance of happiness in it You have a future to live for
man

I hope not said the victim of the system I want to restto rest
and never to be disturbed again

His spirit was broken enough by this time Yet he had resolution
enough to refuse Freres repeated offers Ill never jump it he
said to North if they cut me in half first

North pityingly implored the stubborn mind to have mercy on the
lacerated body but without effect His own wayward heart gave him the
key to read the cipher of this mans life A noble nature ruined said
he to himself What is the secret of his history

Dawes on his part seeing how different from other black coats was this
priestat once so ardent and so gloomy so stern and so tenderbegan
to speculate on the cause of his monitors sunken cheeks fiery eyes
and preoccupied manner to wonder what grief inspired those agonized
prayers those eloquent and daring supplications which were daily
poured out over his rude bed So between these twothe priest and the
sinnerwas a sort of sympathetic bond

One day this bond was drawn so close as to tug at both their
heartstrings The chaplain had a flower in his coat Dawes eyed it with
hungry looks and as the clergyman was about to quit the room said
Mr North will you give me that rosebud North paused irresolutely
and finally as if after a struggle with himself took it carefully from
his buttonhole and placed it in the prisoners brown scarred hand In
another instant Dawes believing himself alone pressed the gift to
his lips North returned abruptly and the eyes of the pair met Dawes
flushed crimson but North turned white as death Neither spoke but
each was drawn close to the other since both had kissed the rosebud
plucked by Sylvias fingers




CHAPTER VIII EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF THE REV JAMES NORTH



October 21stI am safe for another six months if I am careful for my
last bout lasted longer than I expected I suppose one of these days I
shall have a paroxysm that will kill me I shall not regret it

I wonder if this familiar of mineI begin to detest the
expressionwill accuse me of endeavouring to make a case for myself
if I say that I believe my madness to be a disease I do believe it
I honestly can no more help getting drunk than a lunatic can help
screaming and gibbering It would be different with me perhaps were
I a contented man happily married with children about me and family
cares to distract me But as I ama lonely gloomy being debarred from
love devoured by spleen and tortured with repressed desiresI become
a living torment to myself I think of happier men with fair wives
and clinging children of men who are loved and who love of Frere for
instanceand a hideous wild beast seems to stir within me a monster
whose cravings cannot be satisfied can only be drowned in stupefying
brandy

Penitent and shattered I vow to lead a new life to forswear spirits
to drink nothing but water Indeed the sight and smell of brandy make
me ill All goes well for some weeks when I grow nervous discontented
moody I smoke and am soothed But moderation is not to be thought of
little by little I increase the dose of tobacco Five pipes a day become
six or seven Then I count up to ten and twelve then drop to three or
four then mount to eleven at a leap then lose count altogether Much
smoking excites the brain I feel clear bright gay My tongue is
parched in the morning however and I use liquor to literally moisten
my clay I drink wine or beer in moderation and all goes well My
limbs regain their suppleness my hands their coolness my brain its
placidity I begin to feel that I have a will I am confident calm
and hopeful To this condition succeeds one of the most frightful
melancholy I remain plunged for an hour together in a stupor of
despair The earth air sea all appear barren colourless Life is a
burden I long to sleep and sleeping struggle to awake because of the
awful dreams which flap about me in the darkness At night I cry Would
to God it were morning In the morning Would to God it were evening
I loathe myself and all around me I am nerveless passionless bowed
down with a burden like the burden of Saul I know well what will
restore me to life and easerestore me but to cast me back again into
a deeper fit of despair I drink One glassmy blood is warmed my
heart leaps my hand no longer shakes Three glassesI rise with hope
in my soul the evil spirit flies from me I continuepleasing images
flock to my brain the fields break into flower the birds into song
the sea gleams sapphire the warm heaven laughs Great God what man
could withstand a temptation like this

By an effort I shake off the desire to drink deeper and fix my
thoughts on my duties on my books on the wretched prisoners I succeed
perhaps for a time but my blood heated by the wine which is at once my
poison and my life boils in my veins I drink again and dream I feel
all the animal within me stirring In the day my thoughts wander to all
monstrous imaginings The most familiar objects suggest to me loathsome
thoughts Obscene and filthy images surround me My nature seems
changed By day I feel myself a wolf in sheeps clothing a man
possessed by a devil who is ready at any moment to break out and tear
him to pieces At night I become a satyr While in this torment I at
once hate and fear myself One fair face is ever before me gleaming
through my hot dreams like a flying moon in the sultry midnight of a
tropic storm I dare not trust myself in the presence of those whom
I love and respect lest my wild thoughts should find vent in wilder
words I lose my humanity I am a beast Out of this depth there is but
one way of escape Downwards I must drench the monster I have awakened
until he sleeps again I drink and become oblivious In these last
paroxysms there is nothing for me but brandy I shut myself up alone and
pour down my gullet huge draughts of spirit It mounts to my brain I am
a man again and as I regain my manhood I topple overdead drunk

But the awakening Let me not paint it The delirium the fever the
selfloathing the prostration the despair I view in the lookingglass
a haggard face with red eyes I look down upon shaking hands flaccid
muscles and shrunken limbs I speculate if I shall ever be one of those
grotesque and melancholy beings with bleared eyes and running noses
swollen bellies and shrunken legs Ughit is too likely



October 22ndHave spent the day with Mrs Frere She is evidently
eager to leave the placeas eager as I am Frere rejoices in his
murderous power and laughs at her expostulations I suppose men get
tired of their wives In my present frame of mind I am at a loss to
understand how a man could refuse a wife anything

I do not think she can possibly care for him I am not a selfish
sentimentalist as are the majority of seducers I would take no woman
away from a husband for mere liking Yet I think there are cases in
which a man who loved would be justified in making a woman happy at the
risk of his ownsoul I suppose

Making her happy Ay thats the point Would she be happy There are
few men who can endure to be cut slighted pointed at and women
suffer more than men in these regards I a grizzled man of forty am
not such an arrant ass as to suppose that a year of guilty delirium
can compensate to a gentlynurtured woman for the loss of that social
dignity which constitutes her best happiness I am not such an idiot as
to forget that there may come a time when the woman I love may cease to
love me and having no tie of selfrespect social position or family
duty to bind her may inflict upon her seducer that agony which he has
taught her to inflict upon her husband Apart from the question of the
sin of breaking the seventh commandment I doubt if the worst husband
and the most unhappy home are not better in this social condition
of ours than the most devoted lover A strange subject this for a
clergyman to speculate upon If this diary should ever fall into the
hands of a real Godfearing honest booby who never was tempted to sin
by finding that at middleage he loved the wife of another how he would
condemn me And rightly of course



November 4thIn one of the turnkeys rooms in the new gaol is to be
seen an article of harness which at first creates surprise to the mind
of the beholder who considers what animal of the brute creation exists
of so diminutive a size as to admit of its use On inquiry it will be
found to be a bridle perfect in headband throatlash etc for a
human being There is attached to this bridle a round piece of cross
wood of almost four inches in length and one and a half in diameter
This again is secured to a broad strap of leather to cross the mouth
In the wood there is a small hole and when used the wood is inserted
in the mouth the small hole being the only breathing space This being
secured with the various straps and buckles a more complete bridle
could not be well imagined

I was in the gaol last evening at eight oclock I had been to see Rufus
Dawes and returning paused for a moment to speak to Hailey Gimblett
who robbed Mr Vane of two hundred pounds was present he was at
that time a turnkey holding a thirdclass pass and in receipt of
two shillings per diem Everything was quite still I could not help
remarking how quiet the gaol was when Gimblett said Theres someone
speaking I know who that is And forthwith took from its pegs one of
the bridles just described and a pair of handcuffs

I followed him to one of the cells which he opened and therein was
a man lying on his straw mat undressed and to all appearance fast
asleep Gimblett ordered him to get up and dress himself He did so
and came into the yard where Gimblett inserted the ironwood gag in his
mouth The sound produced by his breathing through it which appeared
to be done with great difficulty resembled a low indistinct whistle
Gimblett led him to the lamppost in the yard and I saw that the victim
of his wanton tyranny was the poor blind wretch Mooney Gimblett placed
him with his back against the lamppost and his arms being taken round
were secured by handcuffs round the post I was told that the old man
was to remain in this condition for three hours I went at once to the
Commandant He invited me into his drawingrooman invitation which
I had the good sense to refusebut refused to listen to any plea for
mercy The old impostor is always making his blindness an excuse for
disobedience said heAnd this is her husband




CHAPTER IX THE LONGEST STRAW



Rufus Dawes hearing when on the chain the next day of the wanton
torture of his friend uttered no threat of vengeance but groaned only
I am not so strong as I was said he as if in apology for his lack of
spirit They have unnerved me And he looked sadly down at his gaunt
frame and trembling hands

I cant stand it no longer said Mooney grimly Ive spoken to
Bland and hes of my mind You know what we resolved to do Lets do
it

Rufus Dawes stared at the sightless orbs turned inquiringly to his own
The fingers of his hand thrust into his bosom felt a token which lay
there A shudder thrilled him No no Not now he said

Youre not afeard man asked Mooney stretching out his hand in the
direction of the voice Youre not going to shirk The other avoided
the touch and shrank away still staring You aint going to back out
after you swored it Dawes Youre not that sort Dawes speak man

Is Bland willing asked Dawes looking round as if to seek some
method of escape from the glare of those unspeculative eyes

Ay and ready They flogged him again yesterday

Leave it till tomorrow said Dawes at length

No lets have it over urged the old man with a strange eagerness
Im tired o this

Rufus Dawes cast a wistful glance towards the wall behind which lay the
house of the Commandant Leave it till tomorrow he repeated with
his hand still in his breast

They had been so occupied in their conversation that neither had
observed the approach of their common enemy What are you hiding
there cried Frere seizing Dawes by the wrist More tobacco you
dog The hand of the convict thus suddenly plucked from his bosom
opened involuntarily and a withered rose fell to the earth Frere at
once indignant and astonished picked it up Hallo What the devils
this Youve not been robbing my garden for a nosegay Jack The
Commandant was wont to call all convicts Jack in his moments of
facetiousness It was a little humorous way he had

Rufus Dawes uttered one dismal cry and then stood trembling and cowed
His companions hearing the exclamation of rage and grief that burst
from him looked to see him snatch back the flower or perform some act
of violence Perhaps such was his intention but he did not execute
it One would have thought that there was some charm about this rose so
strangely cherished for he stood gazing at it as it twirled between
Captain Freres strong fingers as though it fascinated him Youre a
pretty man to want a rose for your buttonhole Are you going out with
your sweetheart next Sunday Mr Dawes The gang laughed How did you
get this Dawes was silent Youd better tell me No answer Troke
let us see if we cant find Mr Dawess tongue Pull off your shirt my
man I expect thats the way to your hearteh boys

At this elegant allusion to the lash the gang laughed again and looked
at each other astonished It seemed possible that the leader of the
Ring was going to turn milksop Such indeed appeared to be the
case for Dawes trembling and pale cried Dont flog me again sir
I picked it up in the yard It fell out of your coat one day Frere
smiled with an inward satisfaction at the result of his spiritbreaking
The explanation was probably the correct one He was in the habit of
wearing flowers in his coat and it was impossible that the convict
should have obtained one by any other means Had it been a fig of
tobacco now the astute Commandant knew plenty of men who would have
brought it into the prison But who would risk a flogging for so useless
a thing as a flower Youd better not pick up any more Jack he said
We dont grow flowers for your amusement And contemptuously flinging
the rose over the wall he strode away

The gang left to itself for a moment bestowed their attention upon
Dawes Large tears were silently rolling down his face and he stood
staring at the wall as one in a dream The gang curled their lips One
fellow more charitable than the rest tapped his forehead and
winked Hes going cranky said this goodnatured man who could not
understand what a sane prisoner had to do with flowers Dawes recovered
himself and the contemptuous glances of his companions seemed to bring
back the colour to his cheeks

Well do it tonight whispered he to Mooney and Mooney smiled with
pleasure

Since the tobacco trick Mooney and Dawes had been placed in the new
prison together with a man named Bland who had already twice failed
to kill himself When old Mooney fresh from the torture of the
gagandbridle lamented his hard case Bland proposed that the three
should put in practice a scheme in which two at least must succeed The
scheme was a desperate one and attempted only in the last extremity
It was the custom of the Ring however to swear each of its members
to carry out to the best of his ability this last invention of the
convictdisciplined mind should two other members crave his assistance

The schemelike all great ideaswas simplicity itself

That evening when the celldoor was securely locked and the absence
of a visiting gaoler might be counted upon for an hour at least Bland
produced a straw and held it out to his companions Dawes took it and
tearing it into unequal lengths handed the fragments to Mooney

The longest is the one said the blind man Come on boys and dip in
the luckybag

It was evident that lots were to be drawn to determine to whom fortune
would grant freedom The men drew in silence and then Bland and
Dawes looked at each other The prize had been left in the bag
Mooneyfortunate old fellowretained the longest straw Blands hand
shook as he compared notes with his companion There was a moments
pause during which the blank eyeballs of the blind man fiercely
searched the gloom as if in that awful moment they could penetrate it

I hold the shortest said Dawes to Bland Tis you that must do it

Im glad of that said Mooney

Bland seemingly terrified at the danger which fate had decreed that
he should run tore the fatal lot into fragments with an oath and
sat gnawing his knuckles in excess of abject terror Mooney stretched
himself out upon his plankbed Come on mate he said Bland extended
a shaking hand and caught Rufus Dawes by the sleeve

You have more nerve than I You do it

No no said Dawes almost as pale as his companion Ive run my
chance fairly Twas your own proposal The coward who confident in
his own luck would seem to have fallen into the pit he had dug for
others sat rocking himself to and fro holding his head in his hands

By Heaven I cant do it he whispered lifting a white wet face

What are you waiting for said fortunate Mooney Come on Im ready

IIthought you might like totopray a bit said Bland

The notion seemed to sober the senses of the old man exalted too
fiercely by his good fortune

Ay he said Pray A good thought and he knelt down and
shutting his blind eyestwas as though he was dazzled by some strong
lightunseen by his comrades moved his lips silently The silence was
at last broken by the footsteps of the warder in the corridor Bland
hailed it as a reprieve from whatever act of daring he dreaded We must
wait until he goes he whispered eagerly He might look in

Dawes nodded and Mooney whose quick ear apprised him very exactly of
the position of the approaching gaoler rose from his knees radiant The
sour face of Gimblett appeared at the trap celldoor

All right he asked somewhatso the three thoughtless sourly than
usual

All right was the reply and Mooney added Goodnight Mr
Gimblett

I wonder what is making the old man so cheerful thought Gimblett as
he got into the next corridor

The sound of his echoing footsteps had scarcely died away when upon the
ears of the two less fortunate casters of lots fell the dull sound of
rending woollen The lucky man was tearing a strip from his blanket I
think this will do said he pulling it between his hands to test its
strength I am an old man It was possible that he debated concerning
the descent of some abyss into which the strip of blanket was to lower
him Here Bland catch hold Where are yedont be fainthearted
man It wont take ye long

It was quite dark now in the cell but as Bland advanced his face was
like a white mask floating upon the darkness it was so ghastly pale
Dawes pressed his lucky comrades hand and withdrew to the farthest
corner Bland and Mooney were for a few moments occupied with the
ropedoubtless preparing for escape by means of it The silence
was broken only by the convulsive jangling of Blands ironshe was
shuddering violently At last Mooney spoke again in strangely soft and
subdued tones

Dawes lad do you think there is a Heaven

I know there is a Hell said Dawes without turning his face

Ay and a Heaven lad I think I shall go there You will old chap
for youve been good to meGod bless you youve been very good to me


     


When Troke came in the morning he saw what had occurred at a glance and
hastened to remove the corpse of the strangled Mooney

We drew lots said Rufus Dawes pointing to Bland who crouched in the
corner farthest from his victim and it fell upon him to do it Im the
witness

Theyll hang you for all that said Troke

I hope so said Rufus Dawes



The scheme of escape hit upon by the convict intellect was simply this
Three men being together lots were drawn to determine whom should be
murdered The drawer of the longest straw was the lucky man He was
killed The drawer of the next longest straw was the murderer He was
hanged The unlucky one was the witness He had of course an excellent
chance of being hung also but his doom was not so certain and he
therefore looked upon himself as unfortunate




CHAPTER X A MEETING



John Rex found the George disagreeably prepared for his august
arrival Obsequious waiters took his dressingbag and overcoat the
landlord himself welcomed him at the door Two naval gentlemen came
out of the coffeeroom to stare at him Have you any more luggage
Mr Devine asked the landlord as he flung open the door of the best
drawingroom It was awkwardly evident that his wife had no notion of
suffering him to hide his borrowed light under a bushel

A suppertable laid for two people gleamed bright from the cheeriest
corner A fire crackled beneath the marble mantelshelf The latest
evening paper lay upon a chair and brushing it carelessly with her
costly dress the woman he had so basely deserted came smiling to meet
him

Well Mr Richard Devine said she you did not expect to see me
again did you

Although on his journey down he had composed an elaborate speech
wherewith to greet her this unnatural civility dumbfounded him Sarah
I never meant to

Hush my dear Richardit must be Richard now I suppose This is not
the time for explanations Besides the waiter might hear you Let us
have some supper you must be hungry I am sure He advanced to the
table mechanically But how fat you are she continued Too good
living I suppose You were not so fat at Port ArOh I forgot my
dear Come and sit down Thats right I have told them all that I am
your wife for whom you have sent They regard me with some interest and
respect in consequence Dont spoil their good opinion of me

He was about to utter an imprecation but she stopped him by a glance
No bad language John or I shall ring for a constable Let us
understand one another my dear You may be a very great man to other
people but to me you are merely my runaway husbandan escaped convict
If you dont eat your supper civilly I shall send for the police

Sarah he burst out I never meant to desert you Upon my word It is
all a mistake Let me explain

There is no need for explanations yet JackI mean Richard Have your
supper Ah I know what you want

She poured out half a tumbler of brandy and gave it to him He took the
glass from her hand drank the contents and then as though warmed by
the spirit laughed What a woman you are Sarah I have been a great
brute I confess

You have been an ungrateful villain said she with sudden passion a
hardened selfish villain

But Sarah

Dont touch me Pon my word you are a fine creature and I was a
fool to leave you The compliment seemed to soothe her for her tone
changed somewhat It was a wicked cruel act Jack You whom I saved
from deathwhom I nursedwhom I enriched It was the act of a coward

I admit it It was You admit it Have you no shame then Have you no
pity for me for what I have suffered all these years

I dont suppose you cared much

Dont you You never thought about me at all I have cared this much
John Rexbah the door is shut close enoughthat I have spent a
fortune in hunting you down and now I have found you I will make you
suffer in your turn

He laughed again but uneasily How did you discover me

With a readiness which showed that she had already prepared an answer to
the question she unlocked a writingcase which was on the side table
and took from it a newspaper By one of those strange accidents which
are the ruin of men like you Among the papers sent to the overseer from
his English friends was this one

She held out an illustrated journala Sunday organ of sporting
opinionand pointed to a portrait engraved on the centre page It
represented a broadshouldered bearded man dressed in the fashion
affected by turfites and lovers of horseflesh standing beside a
pedestal on which were piled a variety of racing cups and trophies John
Rex read underneath this work of art the name

MR RICHARD DEVINE THE LEVIATHAN OF THE TURF

And you recognized me

The portrait was sufficiently like you to induce me to make inquiries
and when I found that Mr Richard Devine had suddenly returned from a
mysterious absence of fourteen years I set to work in earnest I have
spent a deal of money Jack but Ive got you

You have been clever in finding me out I give you credit for that

There is not a single act of your life John Rex that I do not know
she continued with heat I have traced you from the day you stole out
of my house until now I know your continental trips your journeyings
here and there in search of a lost clue I pieced together the puzzle
as you have done and I know that by some foul fortune you have stolen
the secret of a dead man to ruin an innocent and virtuous family

Hullo hullo said John Rex Since when have you learnt to talk of
virtue

It is well to taunt but you have got to the end of your tether now
Jack I have communicated with the woman whose sons fortune you have
stolen I expect to hear from Lady Devine in a day or so

Welland when you hear

I shall give back the fortune at the price of her silence

Ho ho Will you

Yes and if my husband does not come back and live with me quietly I
shall call the police

John Rex sprang up Who will believe you idiot he cried Ill have
you sent to gaol as an impostor

You forget my dear she returned playing coquettishly with her
rings and glancing sideways as she spoke that you have already
acknowledged me as your wife before the landlord and the servants It
is too late for that sort of thing Oh my dear Jack you think you are
very clever but I am as clever as you

Smothering a curse he sat down beside her Listen Sarah What is the
use of fighting like a couple of children I am rich

So am I Well so much the better We will join our riches together
I admit that I was a fool and a cur to leave you but I played for a
great stake The name of Richard Devine was worth nearly half a million
in money It is mine I won it Share it with me Sarah you and I
defied the world years ago Dont let us quarrel now I was ungrateful
Forget it We know by this time that we are not either of us angels
We started in life togetherdo you remember Sally when I met you
firstdetermined to make money We have succeeded Why then set to
work to destroy each other You are handsomer than ever I have not lost
my wits Is there any need for you to tell the world that I am a runaway
convict and that you arewell no of course there is no need Kiss
and be friends Sarah I would have escaped you if I could I admit You
have found me out I accept the position You claim me as your husband
You say you are Mrs Richard Devine Very well I admit it You have all
your life wanted to be a great lady Now is your chance Much as she
had cause to hate him well as she knew his treacherous and ungrateful
character little as she had reason to trust him her strange and
distempered affection for the scoundrel came upon her again with
gathering strength As she sat beside him listening to the familiar
tones of the voice she had learned to love greedily drinking in the
promise of a future fidelity which she was well aware was made but to
be broken her memory recalled the past days of trust and happiness
and her womans fancy once more invested the selfish villain she had
reclaimed with those attributes which had enchained her wilful and
wayward affections The unselfish devotion which had marked her conduct
to the swindler and convict was indeed her one redeeming virtue and
perhaps she felt dimlypoor womanthat it were better for her to cling
to that if she lost all the world beside Her wish for vengeance melted
under the influence of these thoughts The bitterness of despised
love the shame and anger of desertion ingratitude and betrayal all
vanished The tears of a sweet forgiveness trembled in her eyes the
unreasoning love of her sexfaithful to nought but love and faithful
to love in deathshook in her voice She took his coward hand and
kissed it pardoning all his baseness with the sole reproach Oh John
John you might have trusted me after all

John Rex had conquered and he smiled as he embraced her I wish I
had said he it would have saved me many regrets but never mind Sit
down now we will have supper

Your preference has one drawback Sarah he said when the meal was
concluded and the two sat down to consider their immediate course of
action it doubles the chance of detection

How so

People have accepted me without inquiry but I am afraid not without
dislike Mr Francis Wade my uncle never liked me and I fear I have
not played my cards well with Lady Devine When they find I have a
mysterious wife their dislike will become suspicion Is it likely that I
should have been married all these years and not have informed them

Very unlikely returned Sarah calmly and that is just the reason why
you have not been married all these years Really she added with
a laugh the male intellect is very dull You have already told ten
thousand lies about this affair and yet you dont see your way to tell
one more

What do you mean

Why my dear Richard you surely cannot have forgotten that you married
me last year on the Continent By the way it was last year that you
were there was it not I am the daughter of a poor clergyman of the
Church of England nameanything you pleaseand you met mewhere
shall we say Baden Aix Brussels Cross the Alps if you like dear
and say Rome John Rex put his hand to his head Of courseI am
stupid said he I have not been well lately Too much brandy I
suppose

Well we will alter all that she returned with a laugh which her
anxious glance at him belied You are going to be domestic now JackI
mean Dick

Go on said he impatiently What then

Then having settled these little preliminaries you take me up to
London and introduce me to your relatives and friends

He started A bold game

Bold Nonsense The only safe one People dont as a rule suspect
unless one is mysterious You must do it I have arranged for your doing
it The waiters here all know me as your wife There is not the least
dangerunless indeed you are married already she added with a
quick and angry suspicion

You need not be alarmed I was not such a fool as to marry another
woman while you were alivehad I even seen one I would have cared to
marry But what of Lady Devine You say you have told her

I have told her to communicate with Mrs Carr Post Office Torquay
in order to hear something to her advantage If you had been rebellious
John the something would have been a letter from me telling her who
you really are Now you have proved obedient the something will be
a begging letter of a sort which she has already received hundreds and
which in all probability she will not even answer What do you think of
that Mr Richard Devine

You deserve success Sarah said the old schemer in genuine
admiration By Jove this is something like the old days when we were
Mr and Mrs Crofton

Or Mr and Mrs Skinner eh John she said with as much tenderness
in her voice as though she had been a virtuous matron recalling her
honeymoon That was an unlucky name wasnt it dear You should have
taken my advice there And immersed in recollection of their past
rogueries the worthy pair pensively smiled Rex was the first to awake
from that pleasant reverie

I will be guided by you then he said What next

Nextfor as you say my presence doubles the dangerwe will contrive
to withdraw quietly from England The introduction to your mother over
and Mr Francis disposed of we will go to Hampstead and live there for
a while During that time you must turn into cash as much property as
you dare We will then go abroad for the seasonand stop there After
a year or so on the Continent you can write to our agent to sell more
property and finally when we are regarded as permanent absenteesand
three or four years will bring that aboutwe will get rid of
everything and slip over to America Then you can endow a charity
if you like or build a church to the memory of the man you have
displaced

John Rex burst into a laugh An excellent plan I like the idea of the
charitythe Devine Hospital eh

By the way how did you find out the particulars of this mans life He
was burned in the Hydaspes wasnt he

No said Rex with an air of pride He was transported in the Malabar
under the name of Rufus Dawes You remember him It is a long story The
particulars werent numerous and if the old lady had been half sharp
she would have bowled me out But the fact was she wanted to find the
fellow alive and was willing to take a good deal on trust Ill tell
you all about it another time I think Ill go to bed now Im tired
and my head aches as though it would split

Then it is decided that you follow my directions

Yes

She rose and placed her hand on the bell What are you going to do he
said uneasily

I am going to do nothing You are going to telegraph to your servants
to have the house in London prepared for your wife who will return with
you the day after tomorrow

John Rex stayed her hand with a sudden angry gesture This is all
devilish fine he said but suppose it fails

That is your affair John You need not go on with this business at
all unless you like I had rather you didnt

What the deuce am I to do then

As he wrote John Rex felt gloomily that though he had succeeded in
recalling her affection that affection was as imperious as of yore




CHAPTER XI EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF THE REV JAMES NORTH



December 7thI have made up my mind to leave this place to bury
myself again in the bush I suppose and await extinction I try to
think that the reason for this determination is the frightful condition
of misery existing among the prisoners that because I am daily
horrified and sickened by scenes of torture and infamy I decide to go
away that feeling myself powerless to save others I wish to spare
myself But in this journal in which I bind myself to write nothing
but truth I am forced to confess that these are not the reasons I will
write the reason plainly I covet my neighbours wife It does not
look well thus written It looks hideous In my own breast I find
numberless excuses for my passion I said to myself My neighbour does
not love his wife and her unloved life is misery She is forced to live
in the frightful seclusion of this accursed island and she is dying for
want of companionship She feels that I understand and appreciate her
that I could love her as she deserves that I could render her happy I
feel that I have met the only woman who has power to touch my heart to
hold me back from the ruin into which I am about to plunge to make
me useful to my fellowsa man and not a drunkard Whispering these
conclusions to myself I am urged to brave public opinion and make two
lives happy I say to myself or rather my desires say to meWhat
sin is there in this Adultery No for a marriage without love is
the coarsest of all adulteries What tie binds a man and woman
togetherthat formula of license pronounced by the priest which the
law has recognized as a legal bond Surely not this only for
marriage is but a partnershipa contract of mutual fidelityand in
all contracts the violation of the terms of the agreement by one of the
contracting persons absolves the other Mrs Frere is then absolved by
her husbands act I cannot but think so But is she willing to risk the
shame of divorce or legal offence Perhaps Is she fitted by temperament
to bear such a burden of contumely as must needs fall upon her Will
she not feel disgust at the man who entrapped her into shame Do not the
comforts which surround her compensate for the lack of affections And
so the torturing catechism continues until I am driven mad with doubt
love and despair

Of course I am wrong of course I outrage my character as a priest of
course I endangeraccording to the creed I teachmy soul and hers But
priests unluckily have hearts and passions as well as other men Thank
God as yet I have never expressed my madness in words What a fate is
mine When I am in her presence I am in torment when I am absent from
her my imagination pictures her surrounded by a thousand graces that are
not hers but belong to all the women of my dreamsto Helen to Juliet
to Rosalind Fools that we are of our own senses When I think of her I
blush when I hear her name my heart leaps and I grow pale Love What
is the love of two pure souls scarce conscious of the Paradise into
which they have fallen to this maddening delirium I can understand the
poison of Circes cup it is the sweettorment of a forbidden love like
mine Away gross materialism in which I have so long schooled myself
I who laughed at passion as the outcome of temperament and easy
livingI who thought in my intellect to sound all the depths and
shoals of human feelingI who analysed my own soulscoffed at my own
yearnings for an immortalityam forced to deify the senseless power of
my creed and believe in God that I may pray to Him I know now why men
reject the cold impersonality that reason tells us rules the worldit
is because they love To die and be no more to die and rendered into
dust be blown about the earth to die and leave our love defenceless
and forlorn till the bright soul that smiled to ours is smothered in
the earth that made it No To love is life eternal God I believe in
Thee Aid me Pity me Sinful wretch that I am to have denied Thee See
me on my knees before Thee Pity me or let me die

December 9thI have been visiting the two condemned prisoners Dawes
and Bland and praying with them O Lord let me save one soul that may
plead with Thee for mine Let me draw one being alive out of this pit I
weepI weary Thee with my prayers O Lord Look down upon me Grant me
a sign Thou didst it in old times to men who were not more fervent
in their supplications than am I So says Thy Book Thy Book which I
believewhich I believe Grant me a signone little sign O LordI
will not see her I have sworn it Thou knowest my griefmy agonymy
despair Thou knowest why I love her Thou knowest how I strive to make
her hate me Is that not a sacrifice I am so lonelya lonely man with
but one creature that he lovesyet what is mortal love to Thee Cruel
and implacable Thou sittest in the heavens men have built for Thee and
scornest them Will not all the burnings and slaughters of the saints
appease Thee Art Thou not sated with blood and tears O God of
vengeance of wrath and of despair Kind Christ pity me Thou
wiltfor Thou wast human Blessed Saviour at whose feet knelt the
Magdalen Divinity who most divine in Thy despair called on Thy cruel
God to save Theeby the memory of that moment when Thou didst deem
Thyself forsakenforsake not me Sweet Christ have mercy on Thy sinful
servant

I can write no more I will pray to Thee with my lips I will shriek my
supplications to Thee I will call upon Thee so loud that all the world
shall hear me and wonder at Thy silenceunjust and unmerciful God

December 14thWhat blasphemies are these which I have uttered in my
despair Horrible madness that has left me prostrate to what heights of
frenzy didst thou not drive my soul Like him of old time who wandered
among the tombs shrieking and tearing himself I have been possessed
by a devil For a week I have been unconscious of aught save torture
I have gone about my daily duties as one who in his dreams repeats the
accustomed action of the day and knows it not Men have looked at me
strangely They look at me strangely now Can it be that my disease of
drunkenness has become the disease of insanity Am I mad or do I but
verge on madness O Lord whom in my agonies I have confessed leave me
my intellectlet me not become a drivelling spectacle for the curious
to point at or to pity At least in mercy spare me a little Let not
my punishment overtake me here Let her memories of me be clouded with
a sense of my rudeness or my brutality let me for ever seem to her
the ungrateful ruffian I strive to show myselfbut let her not behold
methat




CHAPTER XII THE STRANGE BEHAVIOUR OF Mr NORTH



On or about the 8th of December Mrs Frere noticed a sudden and
unaccountable change in the manner of the chaplain He came to her one
afternoon and after talking for some time in a vague and unconnected
manner about the miseries of the prison and the wretched condition of
some of the prisoners began to question her abruptly concerning Rufus
Dawes

I do not wish to think of him said she with a shudder I have the
strangest the most horrible dreams about him He is a bad man He tried
to murder me when a child and had it not been for my husband he would
have done so I have only seen him once since thenat Hobart Town when
he was taken He sometimes speaks to me of you said North eyeing
her He asked me once to give him a rose plucked in your garden

Sylvia turned pale And you gave it him

Yes I gave it him Why not

It was valueless of course but stillto a convict

You are not angry

Oh no Why should I be angry she laughed constrainedly It was a
strange fancy for the man to have thats all

I suppose you would not give me another rose if I asked you

Why not said she turning away uneasily You You are a gentleman

Not Iyou dont know me

What do you mean

I mean that it would be better for you if you had never seen me

Mr North Terrified at the wild gleam in his eyes she had risen
hastily You are talking very strangely

Oh dont be alarmed madam I am not drunkhe pronounced the word
with a fierce energy I had better leave you Indeed I think the less
we see of each other the better

Deeply wounded and astonished at this extraordinary outburst Sylvia
allowed him to stride away without a word She saw him pass through the
garden and slam the little gate but she did not see the agony on his
face or the passionate gesture with whichwhen out of eyeshothe
lamented the voluntary abasement of himself before her She thought
over his conduct with growing fear It was not possible that he was
intoxicatedsuch a vice was the last one of which she could have
believed him guilty It was more probable that some effects of the
fever which had recently confined him to his house yet lingered
So she thought and thinking was alarmed to realize of how much
importance the wellbeing of this man was to her

The next day he met her and bowing passed swiftly This pained her
Could she have offended him by some unlucky word She made Maurice ask
him to dinner and to her astonishment he pleaded illness as an excuse
for not coming Her pride was hurt and she sent him back his books and
music A curiosity that was unworthy of her compelled her to ask the
servant who carried the parcel what the clergyman had said He said
nothingonly laughed Laughed In scorn of her foolishness His
conduct was ungentlemanly and intemperate She would forget as speedily
as possible that such a being had ever existed This resolution taken
she was unusually patient with her husband

So a week passed and Mr North did not return Unluckily for the poor
wretch the very selfsacrifice he had made brought about the precise
condition of things which he was desirous to avoid It is possible that
had the acquaintance between them continued on the same staid footing
it would have followed the lot of most acquaintanceships of the
kindother circumstances and other scenes might have wiped out the
memory of all but common civilities between them and Sylvia might never
have discovered that she had for the chaplain any other feeling but
that of esteem But the very fact of the sudden wrenching away of her
soulcompanion showed her how barren was the solitary life to which
she had been fated Her husband she had long ago admitted with bitter
selfcommunings was utterly unsuited to her She could find in
his society no enjoyment and for the sympathy which she needed was
compelled to turn elsewhere She understood that his love for her had
burnt itself outshe confessed with intensity of selfdegradation
that his apparent affection had been born of sensuality and had
perished in the fires it had itself kindled Many women have unhappily
made some such discovery as this but for most women there is some
distracting occupation Had it been Sylvias fate to live in the midst
of fashion and society she would have found relief in the conversation
of the witty or the homage of the distinguished Had fortune cast her
lot in a city Mrs Frere might have become one of those charming women
who collect around their suppertables whatever of male intellect is
obtainable and who find the husband admirably useful to open his own
champagne bottles The celebrated women who have stepped out of
their domestic circles to enchant or astonish the world have almost
invariably been cursed with unhappy homes But poor Sylvia was not
destined to this fortune Cast back upon herself she found no surcease
of pain in her own imaginings and meeting with a man sufficiently her
elder to encourage her to talk and sufficiently clever to induce her
to seek his society and his advice she learnt for the first time to
forget her own griefs for the first time she suffered her nature
to expand under the sun of a congenial influence This sun suddenly
withdrawn her soul grown accustomed to the warmth and light shivered
at the gloom and she looked about her in dismay at the dull and barren
prospect of life which lay before her In a word she found that the
society of North had become so far necessary to her that to be deprived
of it was a griefnotwithstanding that her husband remained to console
her

After a week of such reflections the barrenness of life grew
insupportable to her and one day she came to Maurice and begged to be
sent back to Hobart Town I cannot live in this horrible island
she said I am getting ill Let me go to my father for a few months
Maurice Maurice consented His wife was looking ill and Major Vickers
was an old mana rich old manwho loved his only daughter It was not
undesirable that Mrs Frere should visit her father indeed so little
sympathy was there between the pair that the first astonishment over
Maurice felt rather glad to get rid of her for a while You can go back
in the Lady Franklin if you like my dear he said I expect her every
day At this decisionmuch to his surpriseshe kissed him with more
show of affection than she had manifested since the death of her child

The news of the approaching departure became known but still North did
not make his appearance Had it not been a step beneath the dignity of
a woman Mrs Frere would have gone herself and asked him the meaning of
his unaccountable rudeness but there was just sufficient morbidity in
the sympathy she had for him to restrain her from an act which a young
girlthough not more innocentwould have dared without hesitation
Calling one day upon the wife of the surgeon however she met the
chaplain face to face and with the consummate art of acting which
most women possess rallied him upon his absence from her house The
behaviour of the poor devil thus stabbed to the heart was curious He
forgot gentlemanly behaviour and the respect due to a woman flung one
despairingly angry glance at her and abruptly retired Sylvia flushed
crimson and endeavoured to excuse North on account of his recent
illness The surgeons wife looked askance and turned the conversation
The next time Sylvia bowed to this lady she got a chilling salute in
return that made her blood boil I wonder how I have offended Mrs
Field she asked Maurice She almost cut me today Oh the old
cat returned Maurice What does it matter if she did However a few
days afterwards it seemed that it did matter for Maurice called upon
Field and conversed seriously with him The issue of the conversation
being reported to Mrs Frere the lady wept indignant tears of wounded
pride and shame It appeared that North had watched her out of the
house returned and relatedin a stumbling hesitating way Mrs
Field saidhow he disliked Mrs Frere how he did not want to visit
her and how flighty and reprehensible such conduct was in a married
woman of her rank and station This act of basenessor profound
noblenessachieved its purpose Sylvia noticed the unhappy priest no
more Between the Commandant and the chaplain now arose a coolness and
Frere set himself by various petty tyrannies to disgust North and
compel him to a resignation of his office The convictgaolers speedily
marked the difference in the treatment of the chaplain and their
demeanour changed For respect was substituted insolence for alacrity
sullenness for prompt obedience impertinent intrusion The men whom
North favoured were selected as special subjects for harshness and for
a prisoner to be seen talking to the clergyman was sufficient to ensure
for him a series of tyrannies The result of this was that North saw the
souls he laboured to save slipping back into the gulf beheld the men he
had half won to love him meet him with averted faces discovered that
to show interest in a prisoner was to injure him not to serve him The
unhappy man grew thinner and paler under this ingenious torment He had
deprived himself of that love which guilty though it might be was
nevertheless the only true love he had known and he found that having
won this victory he had gained the hatred of all living creatures with
whom he came in contact The authority of the Commandant was so supreme
that men lived but by the breath of his nostrils To offend him was to
perish and the man whom the Commandant hated must be hated also by all
those who wished to exist in peace There was but one being who was not
to be turned from his allegiancethe convict murderer Rufus Dawes who
awaited death For many days he had remained mute broken down beneath
his weight of sorrow or of sullenness but North bereft of other love
and sympathy strove with that fighting soul if haply he might win
it back to peace It seemed to the fancy of the priesta fancy
distempered perhaps by excess or superhumanly exalted by mental
agonythat this convict over whom he had wept was given to him as a
hostage for his own salvation I must save him or perish he said I
must save him though I redeem him with my own blood

Frere unable to comprehend the reason of the calmness with which the
doomed felon met his taunts and torments thought that he was shamming
piety to gain some indulgence of meat and drink and redoubled his
severity He ordered Dawes to be taken out to work just before the hour
at which the chaplain was accustomed to visit him He pretended that
the man was dangerous and directed a gaoler to be present at all
interviews lest the chaplain might be murdered He issued an order
that all civil officers should obey the challenges of convicts acting as
watchmen and North coming to pray with his penitent would be stopped
ten times by grinning felons who putting their faces within a foot
of his would roar out Who goes there and burst out laughing at the
reply Under pretence of watching more carefully over the property of
the chaplain he directed that any convict acting as constable might
at any time search everywhere and anywhere for property supposed to be
in the possession of a prisoner The chaplains servant was a prisoner
of course and Norths drawers were ransacked twice in one week by
Troke North met these impertinences with unruffled brow and Frere
could in no way account for his obstinacy until the arrival of the Lady
Franklin explained the chaplains apparent coolness He had sent in his
resignation two months before and the saintly Meekin had been appointed
in his stead Frere unable to attack the clergyman and indignant at
the manner in which he had been defeated revenged himself upon Rufus
Dawes




CHAPTER XIII MR NORTH SPEAKS



The method and manner of Freres revenge became a subject of whispered
conversation on the island It was reported that North had been
forbidden to visit the convict but that he had refused to accept the
prohibition and by a threat of what he would do when the returning
vessel had landed him in Hobart Town had compelled the Commandant to
withdraw his order The Commandant however speedily discovered in
Rufus Dawes signs of insubordination and set to work again to reduce
still further the spirit he had so ingeniously broken The unhappy
convict was deprived of food was kept awake at nights was put to the
hardest labour was loaded with the heaviest irons Troke with devilish
malice suggested that if the tortured wretch would decline to see the
chaplain some amelioration of his condition might be effected but his
suggestions were in vain Fully believing that his death was certain
Dawes clung to North as the saviour of his agonized soul and rejected
all such insidious overtures Enraged at this obstinacy Frere sentenced
his victim to the spread eagle and the stretcher

Now the rumour of the obduracy of this undaunted convict who had been
recalled to her by the clergyman at their strange interview had reached
Sylvias ears She had heard gloomy hints of the punishments inflicted
on him by her husbands order and asconstantly revolving in her
mind was that last conversation with the chaplainshe wondered at the
prisoners strange fancy for a flower her brain began to thrill with
those undefined and dreadful memories which had haunted her childhood
What was the link between her and this murderous villain How came it
that she felt at times so strange a sympathy for his fate and that
hewho had attempted her lifecherished so tender a remembrance of her
as to beg for a flower which her hand had touched

She questioned her husband concerning the convicts misdoings but with
the petulant brutality which he invariably displayed when the name
of Rufus Dawes intruded itself into their conversation Maurice Frere
harshly refused to satisfy her This but raised her curiosity higher
She reflected how bitter he had always seemed against this manshe
remembered how in the garden at Hobart Town the hunted wretch had
caught her dress with words of assured confidenceshe recollected
the fragment of cloth he passionately flung from him and which her
affianced lover had contemptuously tossed into the stream The name
of Dawes detested as it had become to her bore yet some strange
association of comfort and hope What secret lurked behind the twilight
that had fallen upon her childish memories Deprived of the advice
of Northto whom a few weeks back she would have confided her
misgivingsshe resolved upon a project that for her was most
distasteful She would herself visit the gaol and judge how far the
rumours of her husbands cruelty were worthy of credit

One sultry afternoon when the Commandant had gone on a visit of
inspection Troke lounging at the door of the New Prison beheld with
surprise the figure of the Commandants lady

What is it mam he asked scarcely able to believe his eyes

I want to see the prisoner Dawes

Trokes jaw fell

See Dawes he repeated

Yes Where is he

Troke was preparing a lie The imperious voice and the clear steady
gaze confused him

 Hes here

Let me see him

Heshes under punishment mam

What do you mean Are they flogging him

No but hes dangerous mam The Commandant

Do you mean to open the door or not Mr Troke

Troke grew more confused It was evident that he was most unwilling to
open the door The Commandant has given strict orders

Do you wish me to complain to the Commandant cries Sylvia with a
touch of her old spirit and jumped hastily at the conclusion that
the gaolers were perhaps torturing the convict for their own
entertainment Open the door at onceat once

Thus commanded Troke with a hasty growl of its being no affair of
his and he hoped Mrs Frere would tell the captain how it happened
flung open the door of a cell on the right hand of the doorway It was
so dark that at first Sylvia could distinguish nothing but the outline
of a framework with something stretched upon it that resembled a human
body Her first thought was that the man was dead but this was not
sohe groaned Her eyes accustoming themselves to the gloom began to
see what the punishment was Upon the floor was placed an iron frame
about six feet long and two and a half feet wide with round iron bars
placed transversely about twelve inches apart The man she came to
seek was bound in a horizontal position upon this frame with his neck
projecting over the end of it If he allowed his head to hang the blood
rushed to his brain and suffocated him while the effort to keep it
raised strained every muscle to agony pitch His face was purple and he
foamed at the mouth Sylvia uttered a cry This is no punishment its
murder Who ordered this

The Commandant said Troke sullenly

I dont believe it Loose him

I darent mam said Troke

Loose him I say Haileyyou sir there The noise had brought
several warders to the spot Do you hear me Do you know who I am
Loose him I say In her eagerness and compassion she was on her knees
by the side of the infernal machine plucking at the ropes with her
delicate fingers Wretches you have cut his flesh He is dying Help
You have killed him The prisoner in fact seeing this angel of mercy
stooping over him and hearing close to him the tones of a voice that
for seven years he had heard but in his dreams had fainted Troke and
Hailey alarmed by her vehemence dragged the stretcher out into the
light and hastily cut the lashings Dawes rolled off like a log and
his head fell against Mrs Frere Troke roughly pulled him aside and
called for water Sylvia trembling with sympathy and pale with passion
turned upon the crew How long has he been like this

An hour said Troke

A lie said a stern voice at the door He has been there nine hours

Wretches cried Sylvia you shall hear more of this Oh oh I am
sickshe felt for the wallII North watched her with agony on
his face but did not move I faint Ishe uttered a despairing cry
that was not without a touch of anger Mr North do you not see Oh
Take me hometake me home and she would have fallen across the body
of the tortured prisoner had not North caught her in his arms

Rufus Dawes awaking from his stupor saw in the midst of a sunbeam
which penetrated a window in the corridor the woman who came to
save his body supported by the priest who came to save his soul and
staggering to his knees he stretched out his hands with a hoarse cry
Perhaps something in the action brought back to the dimmed remembrance
of the Commandants wife the image of a similar figure stretching forth
its hands to a frightened child in the mysterious faroff time She
started and pushing back her hair bent a wistful terrified gaze upon
the face of the kneeling man as though she would fain read there an
explanation of the shadowy memory which haunted her It is possible that
she would have spoken but Norththinking the excitement had produced
one of those hysterical crises which were common to hergently drew
her still gazing back towards the gate The convicts arms fell
and an undefinable presentiment of evil chilled him as he beheld
the priestemotion pallid in his cheeksslowly draw the fair young
creature from out the sunlight into the grim shadow of the heavy
archway For an instant the gloom swallowed them and it seemed to Dawes
that the strange wild man of God had in that instant become a man of
Evilblighting the brightness and the beauty of the innocence that
clung to him For an instantand then they passed out of the prison
archway into the free air of heavenand the sunlight glowed golden on
their faces

You are ill said North You will faint Why do you look so wildly

What is it she whispered more in answer to her own thoughts than
to his questionwhat is it that links me to that man What deedwhat
terrorwhat memory I tremble with crowding thoughts that die ere they
can whisper to me Oh that prison

Look up we are in the sunshine

She passed her hand across her brow sighing heavily as one awaking
from a disturbed slumbershuddered and withdrew her arm from his
North interpreted the action correctly and the blood rushed to his
face Pardon me you cannot walk alone you will fall I will leave you
at the gate

In truth she would have fallen had he not again assisted her She
turned upon him eyes whose reproachful sorrow had almost forced him to
a confession but he bowed his head and held silence They reached the
house and he placed her tenderly in a chair Now you are safe madam
I will leave you

She burst into tears Why do you treat me thus Mr North What have I
done to make you hate me

Hate you said North with trembling lips Oh no I do notdo not
hate you I am rude in my speech abrupt in my manner You must forget
it andand me A horses feet crashed upon the gravel and an instant
after Maurice Frere burst into the room Returning from the Cascades he
had met Troke and learned the release of the prisoner Furious at this
usurpation of authority by his wife his selfesteem wounded by the
thought that she had witnessed his mean revenge upon the man he had so
infamously wronged and his natural brutality enhanced by brandy he had
made for the house at full gallop determined to assert his authority
Blind with rage he saw no one but his wife What the devils this
I hear You have been meddling in my business You release prisoners
You

Captain Frere said North stepping forward to assert the restraining
presence of a stranger Frere started astonished at the intrusion of
the chaplain Here was another outrage of his dignity another insult to
his supreme authority In its passion his gross mind leapt to the worst
conclusion You here too What do you want herewith my wife This is
your quarrel is it His eyes glanced wrathfully from one to the other
and he strode towards North You infernal hypocritical lying scoundrel
if it wasnt for your black coat Id

Maurice cried Sylvia in an agony of shame and terror striving
to place a restraining hand upon his arm He turned upon her with so
fiercely infamous a curse that North pale with righteous rage seemed
prompted to strike the burly ruffian to the earth For a moment the
two men faced each other and then Frere muttering threats of vengeance
against each and allconvicts gaolers wife and priestflung the
suppliant woman violently from him and rushed from the room She fell
heavily against the wall and as the chaplain raised her he heard the
hoofstrokes of the departing horse

Oh cried Sylvia covering her face with trembling hands let me
leave this place

North enfolding her in his arms strove to soothe her with incoherent
words of comfort Dizzy with the blow she had received she clung to him
sobbing Twice he tried to tear himself away but had he loosed his hold
she would have fallen He could not hold herbruised suffering and
in tearsthus against his heart and keep silence In a torrent of
agonized eloquence the story of his love burst from his lips Why
should you be thus tortured he cried Heaven never willed you to
be mated to that booryou whose life should be all sunshine Leave
himleave him He has cast you off We have both suffered Let us leave
this dreadful placethis isthmus between earth and hell I will give
you happiness

I am going she said faintly I have already arranged to go

North trembled It was not of my seeking Fate has willed it We go
together

They looked at each othershe felt the fever of his blood she read his
passion in his eyes she comprehended the hatred he had affected for
her and deadly pale drew back the cold hand he held

Go she murmured If you love me leave meleave me Do not see me
or speak to me again her silence added the words she could not utter
till then




CHAPTER XIV GETTING READY FOR SEA



Maurice Freres passion had spent itself in that last act of violence
He did not return to the prison as he promised himself but turned into
the road that led to the Cascades He repented him of his suspicions
There was nothing strange in the presence of the chaplain Sylvia had
always liked the man and an apology for his conduct had doubtless
removed her anger To make a mountain out of a molehill was the act of
an idiot It was natural that she should release Daweswomen were so
tenderhearted A few wellchosen calmlyuttered platitudes anent the
necessity for the treatment that to those unaccustomed to the desperate
wickedness of convicts must appear harsh would have served his turn
far better than bluster and abuse Moreover North was to sail in
the Lady Franklin and might put in execution his threats of official
complaint unless he was carefully dealt with To put Dawes again to the
torture would be to show to Troke and his friends that the Commandants
wife had acted without the Commandants authority and that must not
be shown He would now return and patch up a peace His wife would sail
in the same vessel with North and he would in a few days be left alone
on the island to pursue his discipline unchecked With this intent
he returned to the prison and gravely informed poor Troke that he was
astonished at his barbarity Mrs Frere who most luckily had appointed
to meet me this evening at the prison tells me that the poor devil
Dawes had been on the stretcher since seven oclock this morning

You ordered it fust thing yer honour said Troke

Yes you fool but I didnt order you to keep the man there for nine
hours did I Why you scoundrel you might have killed him Troke
scratched his head in bewilderment Take his irons off and put him
in a separate cell in the old gaol If a man is a murderer that is no
reason you should take the law into your own hands is it Youd better
take care Mr Troke On the way back he met the chaplain who seeing
him made for a bypath in curious haste Halloo roared Frere Hi
Mr North Mr North paused and the Commandant made at him abruptly
Look here sir I was rude to you just nowdevilish rude Most
ungentlemanly of me I must apologize North bowed without speaking
and tried to pass

You must excuse my violence Frere went on Im badtempered and I
didnt like my wife interfering Women dont you know dont see these
thingsdont understand these scoundrels North again bowed Why
dn it how savage you look Quite ghastly bigod I must have said
most outrageous things Forget and forgive you know Come home and have
some dinner

I cannot enter your house again sir said North in tones more
agitated than the occasion would seem to warrant

Frere shrugged his great shoulders with a clumsy affectation of good
humour and held out his hand Well shake hands parson Youll have
to take care of Mrs Frere on the voyage and we may as well make up our
differences before you start Shake hands

Let me pass sir cried North with heightened colour and ignoring
the proffered hand strode savagely on

Youve a dd fine temper for a parson said Frere to himself
However if you wont you wont Hang me if Ill ask you again
Nor when he reached home did he fare better in his efforts at
reconciliation with his wife Sylvia met him with the icy front of a
woman whose pride has been wounded too deeply for tears

Say no more about it she said I am going to my father If you want
to explain your conduct explain it to him

Come Sylvia he urged I was a brute I know Forgive me

It is useless to ask me she said I cannot I have forgiven you so
much during the last seven years

He attempted to embrace her but she withdrew herself loathingly from
his arms He swore a great oath at her and too obstinate to argue
farther sulked Blunt coming in about some ship matters the pair
drank rum Sylvia went to her room and occupied herself with some minor
details of clothespacking it is wonderful how women find relief from
thoughts in household care while North poor fool seeing from his
window the light in hers sat staring at it alternately cursing and
praying In the meantime the unconscious cause of all of thisRufus
Dawessat in his new cell wondering at the chance which had procured
him comfort and blessing the fair hands that had brought it to him He
doubted not but that Sylvia had interceded with his tormentor and by
gentle pleading brought him ease God bless her he murmured I
have wronged her all these years She did not know that I suffered He
waited anxiously for North to visit him that he might have his belief
confirmed I will get him to thank her for me he thought But North
did not come for two whole days No one came but his gaolers and
gazing from his prison window upon the sea that almost washed its walls
he saw the schooner at anchor mocking him with a liberty he could
not achieve On the third day however North came His manner was
constrained and abrupt His eyes wandered uneasily and he seemed
burdened with thoughts which he dared not utter

I want you to thank her for me Mr North said Dawes

Thank whom

Mrs Frere

The unhappy priest shuddered at hearing the name

I do not think you owe any thanks to her Your irons were removed by
the Commandants order

But by her persuasion I feel sure of it Ah I was wrong to think she
had forgotten me Ask her for her forgiveness

Forgiveness said North recalling the scene in the prison What have
you done to need her forgiveness

I doubted her said Rufus Dawes I thought her ungrateful and
treacherous I thought she delivered me again into the bondage from
whence I had escaped I thought she had betrayed mebetrayed me to the
villain whose base life I saved for her sweet sake

What do you mean asked North You never spoke to me of this

No I had vowed to bury the knowledge of it in my own breastit was
too bitter to speak

 Saved his life

Ay and hers I made the boat that carried her to freedom I held her
in my arms and took the bread from my own lips to feed her

She cannot know this said North in an undertone

She has forgotten it perhaps for she was but a child But you will
remind her will you not You will do me justice in her eyes before I
die You will get her forgiveness for me

North could not explain why such an interview as the convict desired was
impossible and so he promised

She is going away in the schooner said he concealing the fact of his
own departure I will see her before she goes and tell her

God bless you sir said poor Dawes Now pray with me and the
wretched priest mechanically repeated one of the formulae his Church
prescribes

The next day he told his penitent that Mrs Frere had forgiven him This
was a lie He had not seen her but what should a lie be to him now
Lies were needful in the tortuous path he had undertaken to tread
Yet the deceit he was forced to practise cost him many a pang He had
succumbed to his passion and to win the love for which he yearned had
voluntarily abandoned truth and honour but standing thus alone with
his sin he despised and hated himself To deaden remorse and drown
reflection he had recourse to brandy and though the fierce excitement
of his hopes and fears steeled him against the stupefying action of the
liquor he was rendered by it incapable of calm reflection In certain
nervous conditions our mere physical powers are proof against the
action of alcohol and though ten times more drunk than the toper who
incoherently stammering reels into the gutter we can walk erect
and talk with fluency Indeed in this artificial exaltation of the
sensibilities men often display a brilliant wit and an acuteness of
comprehension calculated to delight their friends and terrify their
physicians North had reached this condition of braindrunkenness In
plain terms he was trembling on the verge of madness

The days passed swiftly and Blunts preparations for sea were
completed There were two stern cabins in the schooner one of which
was appropriated to Mrs Frere while the other was set apart for North
Maurice had not attempted to renew his overtures of friendship and the
chaplain had not spoken Mindful of Sylvias last words he had resolved
not to meet her until fairly embarked upon the voyage which he intended
should link their fortunes together On the morning of the 19th
December Blunt declared himself ready to set sail and in the afternoon
the two passengers came on board

Rufus Dawes gazing from his window upon the schooner that lay outside
the reef thought nothing of the fact that after the Commandants boat
had taken away the Commandants wife another boat should put off with
the chaplain It was quite natural that Mr North should desire to bid
his friends farewell and through the hot still afternoon he watched
for the returning boat hoping that the chaplain would bring him some
message from the woman whom he was never to see more on earth The hours
wore on however and no breath of wind ruffled the surface of the sea
The day was exceedingly close and sultry heavy dun clouds hung on the
horizon and it seemed probable that unless a thunderstorm should clear
the air before night the calm would continue Blunt however with a
true sailors obstinacy in regard to weather swore there would be a
breeze and held to his purpose of sailing The hot afternoon passed
away in a sultry sunset and it was not until the shades of evening had
begun to fall that Rufus Dawes distinguished a boat detach itself from
the sides of the schooner and glide through the oily water to the
jetty The chaplain was returning and in a few hours perhaps would
be with him to bring him the message of comfort for which his soul
thirsted He stretched out his unshackled limbs and throwing himself
upon his stretcher fell to recalling the pasthis boatbuilding the
news of his fortune his love and his selfsacrifice

North however was not returning to bring to the prisoner a message of
comfort but he was returning on purpose to see him nevertheless The
unhappy man torn by remorse and passion had resolved upon a course
of action which seemed to him a penance for his crime of deceit He
determined to confess to Dawes that the message he had brought was
wholly fictitious that he himself loved the wife of the Commandant
and that with her he was about to leave the island for ever I am no
hypocrite he thought in his exaltation If I choose to sin I will
sin boldly and this poor wretch who looks up to me as an angel shall
know me for my true self

The notion of thus destroying his own fame in the eyes of the man whom
he had taught to love him was pleasant to his diseased imagination It
was the natural outcome of the morbid condition of mind into which he
had drifted and he provided for the complete execution of his scheme
with cunning born of the mischief working in his brain It was desirable
that the fatal stroke should be dealt at the last possible instant that
he should suddenly unveil his own infamy and then depart never to be
seen again To this end he had invented an excuse for returning to the
shore at the latest possible moment He had purposely left in his room
a dressingbagthe sort of article one is likely to forget in the hurry
of departure from ones house and so certain to remember when the time
comes to finally prepare for settling in another He had ingeniously
extracted from Blunt the fact that he didnt expect a wind before dark
but wanted all shipshape and aboard and then just as darkness fell
discovered that it was imperative for him to go ashore Blunt cursed
but if the chaplain insisted upon going there was no help for it

Therell be a breeze in less than two hours said he Youve plenty
of time but if youre not back before the first puff Ill sail without
you as sure as youre born North assured him of his punctuality
Dont wait for me Captain if Im not here said he with the
lightness of tone which men use to mask anxiety Id take him at his
word Blunt said the Commandant who was affably waiting to take final
farewell of his wife Give way there men he shouted to the crew
and wait at the jetty If Mr North misses his ship through your
laziness youll pay for it So the boat set off North laughing
uproariously at the thought of being late Frere observed with some
astonishment that the chaplain wrapped himself in a boat cloak that lay
in the stern sheets Does the fellow want to smother himself in a night
like this was his remark The truth was that though his hands and
head were burning Norths teeth chattered with cold Perhaps this was
the reason why when landed and out of eyeshot of the crew he produced
a pocketflask of rum and eagerly drank The spirit gave him courage for
the ordeal to which he had condemned himself and with steadied step
he reached the door of the old prison To his surprise Gimblett refused
him admission

But I have come direct from the Commandant said North

Got any order sir

Order No

I cant let you in your reverence said Gimblett

I want to see the prisoner Dawes I have a special message for him I
have come ashore on purpose

I am very sorry sir

The ship will sail in two hours man and I shall miss her said
North indignant at being frustrated in his design Let me pass

Upon my honour sir I darent said Gimblett who was not without his
good points You know what authority is sir

North was in despair but a bright thought struck hima thought that
in his soberer moments would never have entered his headhe would buy
admission He produced the rum flask from beneath the sheltering cloak
Come dont talk nonsense to me Gimblett You dont suppose I would
come here without authority Here take a pull at this and let me
through Gimbletts features relaxed into a smile Well sir I
suppose its all right if you say so said he And clutching the rum
bottle with one hand he opened the door of Dawess cell with the other

North entered and as the door closed behind him the prisoner who had
been lying apparently asleep upon his bed leapt up and made as though
to catch him by the throat



Rufus Dawes had dreamt a dream Alone amid the gathering glooms
his fancy had recalled the past and had peopled it with memories He
thought that he was once more upon the barren strand where he had first
met with the sweet child he loved He lived again his life of usefulness
and honour He saw himself working at the boat embarking and putting
out to sea The fair head of the innocent girl was again pillowed on his
breast her young lips again murmured words of affection in his greedy
ear Frere was beside him watching him as he had watched before Once
again the grey sea spread around him barren of succour Once again
in the wild wet morning he beheld the American brig bearing down upon
them and saw the bearded faces of the astonished crew He saw Frere
take the child in his arms and mount upon the deck he heard the shout
of delight that went up and pressed again the welcoming hands which
greeted the rescued castaways The deck was crowded All the folk he had
ever known were there He saw the white hair and stern features of
Sir Richard Devine and beside him stood wringing her thin hands his
weeping mother Then Frere strode forward and after him John Rex
the convict who roughly elbowing through the crowd of prisoners and
gaolers would have reached the spot where stood Sir Richard Devine but
that the corpse of the murdered Lord Bellasis arose and thrust him back
How the hammers clattered in the shipbuilders yard Was it a coffin
they were making Not for Sylviasurely not for her The air grows
heavy lurid with flame and black with smoke The Hydaspes is on fire
Sylvia clings to her husband Base wretch would you shake her off Look
up the midnight heaven is glittering with stars above the smoke
the air breathes delicately One stepanother Fix your eyes on
minesoto my heart Alas she turns he catches at her dress What
It is a priesta priestwho smiling with infernal joy would drag
her to the flaming gulf that yawns for him The dreamer leaps at the
wretchs throat and crying Villain was it for this fate I saved
herand awakes to find himself struggling with the monster of his
dream the idol of his waking sensesMr North



North paralysed no less by the suddenness of the attack than by the
words with which it was accompanied let fall his cloak and stood
trembling before the prophetic accusation of the man whose curses he had
come to earn

I was dreaming said Rufus Dawes A terrible dream But it has passed
now The messageyou have brought me a message have you not Whywhat
ails you You are paleyour knees tremble Did my violence

North recovered himself with a great effort It is nothing Let us
talk for my time is short You have thought me a good manone blessed
of God one consecrated to a holy service a man honest pure and
truthful I have returned to tell you the truth I am none of these
things Rufus Dawes sat staring unable to comprehend this madness
I told you that the woman you lovedfor you do love hersent you a
message of forgiveness I lied

What

I never told her of your confession I never mentioned your name to
her

And she will go without knowingOh Mr North what have you done

Wrecked my own soul cried North wildly stung by the reproachful
agony of the tone Do not cling to me My task is done You will hate
me now That is my wishI merit it Let me go I say I shall be too
late

Too late For what He looked at the cloakthrough the open window
came the voices of the men in the boatthe memory of the rose of the
scene in the prison flashed across him and he understood it all

Great Heaven you go together

Let me go repeated North in a hoarse voice

Rufus Dawes stepped between him and the door No madman I will not
let you go to do this great wrong to kill this innocent young soul
whoGod help herloves you North confounded at this sudden reversal
of their position towards each other crouched bewildered against the
wall I say you shall not go You shall not destroy your own soul and
hers You love her So do I and my love is mightier than yours for it
shall save her

In Gods name cried the unhappy priest striving to stop his ears

Ay in Gods name In the name of that God whom in my torments I had
forgotten In the name of that God whom you taught me to remember That
God who sent you to save me from despair gives me strength to save you
in my turn Oh Mr Northmy teachermy friendmy brotherby the
sweet hope of mercy which you preached to me be merciful to this erring
woman

North lifted agonized eyes But I love her Love her do you hear What
do you know of love

Love cried Rufus Dawes his pale face radiant Love Oh it is you
who do not know it Love is the sacrifice of self the death of all
desire that is not for anothers good Love is Godlike You loveno
no your love is selfishness and will end in shame Listen I will tell
you the history of such a love as yours

North enthralled by the others overmastering will fell back
trembling

I will tell you the secret of my life the reason why I am here Come
closer


     




CHAPTER XV THE DISCOVERY



The house in Clarges Street was duly placed at the disposal of Mrs
Richard Devine who was installed in it to the profound astonishment
and disgust of Mr Smithers and his fellowservants It now only
remained that the lady should be formally recognized by Lady Devine The
rest of the ingenious programme would follow as a matter of course John
Rex was well aware of the position which in his assumed personality he
occupied in society He knew that by the world of servants of waiters
of those to whom servants and waiters could babble of such turfites
and menabouttown as had reason to inquire concerning Mr Richards
domestic affairsno opinion could be expressed save that Devines
married somebody I hear with variations to the same effect He knew
well that the really great world the Society whose scandal would have
been socially injurious had long ceased to trouble itself with Mr
Richard Devines doings in any particular If it had been reported that
the Leviathan of the Turf had married his washerwoman Society would
only have intimated that it was just what might have been expected
of him To say the truth however Mr Richard had rather hoped
thatdisgusted at his brutalityLady Devine would have nothing more
to do with him and that the ordeal of presenting his wife would not
be necessary Lady Devine however had resolved on a different line
of conduct The intelligence concerning Mr Richard Devines threatened
proceedings seemed to nerve her to the confession of the dislike which
had been long growing in her mind seemed even to aid the formation of
those doubts the shadows of which had now and then cast themselves upon
her belief in the identity of the man who called himself her son His
conduct is brutal said she to her brother I cannot understand it

It is more than brutal it is unnatural returned Francis Wade and
stole a look at her Moreover he is married

Married cried Lady Devine

So he says continued the other producing the letter sent to him by
Rex at Sarahs dictation He writes to me stating that his wife whom
he married last year abroad has come to England and wishes us to
receive her

I will not receive her cried Lady Devine rising and pacing down the
path

But that would be a declaration of war said poor Francis twisting
an Italian onyx which adorned his irresolute hand I would not advise
that

Lady Devine stopped suddenly with the gesture of one who has finally
made a difficult and longconsidered resolution Richard shall not sell
this house she said

But my dear Ellinor cried her brother in some alarm at this
unwonted decision I am afraid that you cant prevent him

If he is the man he says he is I can returned she with effort

Francis Wade gasped If he is the man It is trueI have sometimes
thoughtOh Ellinor can it be that we have been deceived

She came to him and leant upon him for support as she had leant upon
her son in the garden where they now stood nineteen years ago I do
not know I am afraid to think But between Richard and myself is a
secreta shameful secret Frank known to no other living person If
the man who threatens me does not know that secret he is not my son If
he does know it

Well in Heavens name what then

He knows that he has neither part nor lot in the fortune of the man who
was my husband

Ellinor you terrify me What does this mean

I will tell you if there be need to do so said the unhappy lady But
I cannot now I never meant to speak of it again even to him Consider
that it is hard to break a silence of nearly twenty years Write to
this man and tell him that before I receive his wife I wish to see him
alone Nodo not let him come here until the truth be known I will go
to him

It was with some trepidation that Mr Richard sitting with his wife on
the afternoon of the 3rd May 1846 awaited the arrival of his mother
He had been very nervous and unstrung for some days past and the
prospect of the coming interview was for some reason he could not
explain to himself weighty with fears What does she want to come
alone for And what can she have to say he asked himself She cannot
suspect anything after all these years surely He endeavoured to
reason with himself but in vain the knock at the door which announced
the arrival of his pretended mother made his heart jump

I feel deuced shaky Sarah he said Lets have a nip of something

Youve been nipping too much for the last five years Dick She had
quite schooled her tongue to the new name Your shakiness is the
result of nipping Im afraid

Oh dont preach I am not in the humour for it

Help yourself then You are quite sure that you are ready with your
story

The brandy revived him and he rose with affected heartiness My dear
mother allow me to present to you He paused for there was that in
Lady Devines face which confirmed his worst fears

I wish to speak to you alone she said ignoring with steady eyes the
woman whom she had ostensibly come to see

John Rex hesitated but Sarah saw the danger and hastened to confront
it A wife should be a husbands best friend madam Your son married
me of his own free will and even his mother can have nothing to say to
him which it is not my duty and privilege to hear I am not a girl as
you can see and I can bear whatever news you bring

Lady Devine bit her pale lips She saw at once that the woman before her
was not gentlyborn but she felt also that she was a woman of higher
mental calibre than herself Prepared as she was for the worst this
sudden and open declaration of hostilities frightened her as Sarah had
calculated She began to realize that if she was to prove equal to
the task she had set herself she must not waste her strength in
skirmishing Steadily refusing to look at Richards wife she addressed
herself to Richard My brother will be here in half an hour she said
as though the mention of his name would better her position in some way
But I begged him to allow me to come first in order that I might speak
to you privately

Well said John Rex we are in private What have you to say

I want to tell you that I forbid you to carry out the plan you have for
breaking up Sir Richards property

Forbid me cried Rex much relieved Why I only want to do what my
fathers will enables me to do

Your fathers will enables you to do nothing of the sort and you know
it She spoke as though rehearsing a series of setspeeches and Sarah
watched her with growing alarm

Oh nonsense cries John Rex in sheer amazement I have a lawyers
opinion on it

Do you remember what took place at Hampstead this day nineteen years
ago

At Hampstead said Rex grown suddenly pale This day nineteen years
ago No What do you mean

Do you not remember she continued leaning forward eagerly and
speaking almost fiercely Do you not remember the reason why you
left the house where you were born and which you now wish to sell to
strangers

John Rex stood dumbfounded the blood suffusing his temples He knew
that among the secrets of the man whose inheritance he had stolen was
one which he had never gainedthe secret of that sacrifice to which
Lady Devine had once referredand he felt that this secret was to be
revealed to crush him now

Sarah trembling also but more with rage than terror swept towards
Lady Devine Speak out she said if you have anything to say Of
what do you accuse my husband

Of imposture cried Lady Devine all her outraged maternity nerving
her to abash her enemy This man may be your husband but he is not my
son

Now that the worst was out John Rex choking with passion felt all the
devil within him rebelling against defeat You are mad he said You
have recognized me for three years and now because I want to claim
that which is my own you invent this lie Take care how you provoke me
If I am not your sonyou have recognized me as such I stand upon the
law and upon my rights

Lady Devine turned swiftly and with both hands to her bosom confronted
him

You shall have your rights You shall have what the law allows you
Oh how blind I have been all these years Persist in your infamous
imposture Call yourself Richard Devine still and I will tell the
world the shameful secret which my son died to hide Be Richard Devine
Richard Devine was a bastard and the law allows himnothing

There was no doubting the truth of her words It was impossible that
even a woman whose home had been desecrated as hers had been would
invent a lie so selfcondemning Yet John Rex forced himself to appear
to doubt and his dry lips asked If then your husband was not the
father of your son who was

My cousin Armigell Esme Wade Lord Bellasis answered Lady Devine

John Rex gasped for breath His hand tugging at his neckcloth rent
away the linen that covered his choking throat The whole horizon of
his past was lit up by a lightning flash which stunned him His brain
already enfeebled by excess was unable to withstand this last shock
He staggered and but for the cabinet against which he leant would
have fallen The secret thoughts of his heart rose to his lips and were
uttered unconsciously Lord Bellasis He was my father also andI
killed him

A dreadful silence fell and then Lady Devine stretching out her hands
towards the selfconfessed murderer with a sort of frightful respect
said in a whisper in which horror and supplication were strangely
mingled What did you do with my son Did you kill him also

But John Rex wagging his head from side to side like a beast in the
shambles that has received a mortal stroke made no reply Sarah Purfoy
awed as she was by the dramatic force of the situation nevertheless
remembered that Francis Wade might arrive at any moment and saw her
last opportunity for safety She advanced and touched the mother on the
shoulder

Your son is alive

Where

Will you promise not to hinder us leaving this house if I tell you

Yes yes

Will you promise to keep the confession which you have heard secret
until we have left England

I promise anything In Gods name woman if you have a womans heart
speak Where is my son

Sarah Purfoy rose over the enemy who had defeated her and said in
level deliberate accents They call him Rufus Dawes He is a convict
at Norfolk Island transported for life for the murder which you have
heard my husband confess to having committedAh

Lady Devine had fainted




CHAPTER XVI FIFTEEN HOURS



Sarah flew to Rex Rouse yourself John for Heavens sake We have not
a moment John Rex passed his hand over his forehead wearily

I cannot think I am broken down I am ill My brain seems dead

Nervously watching the prostrate figure on the floor she hurried on
bonnet cloak and veil and in a twinkling had him outside the house
and into a cab

Thirtynine Lombard Street Quick

You wont give me up said Rex turning dull eyes upon her

Give you up No But the police will be after us as soon as that woman
can speak and her brother summon his lawyer I know what her promise is
worth We have only got about fifteen hours start

I cant go far Sarah said he I am sleepy and stupid

She repressed the terrible fear that tugged at her heart and strove to
rally him

Youve been drinking too much John Now sit still and be good while I
go and get some money for you

She hurried into the bank and her name secured her an interview with
the manager at once

Thats a rich woman said one of the clerks to his friend A widow
too Chance for you Tom returned the other and presently from out
the sacred presence came another clerk with a request for a draft on
Sydney for three thousand less premium and bearing a cheque signed
Sarah Carr for L200 which he took in notes and so returned again

From the bank she was taken to Greens Shipping Office I want a cabin
in the first ship for Sydney please

The shippingclerk looked at a board The Highflyer goes in twelve
days madam and there is one cabin vacant

I want to go at oncetomorrow or next day

He smiled I am afraid that is impossible said he Just then one of
the partners came out of his private room with a telegram in his hand
and beckoned the shippingclerk Sarah was about to depart for another
office when the clerk came hastily back

Just the thing for you maam said he We have got a telegram from
a gentleman who has a first cabin in the Dido to say that his wife has
been taken ill and he must give up his berth

When does the Dido sail

Tomorrow morning She is at Plymouth waiting for the mails If you
go down tonight by the mailtrain which leaves at 930 you will be in
plenty of time and we will telegraph

I will take the cabin How much

One hundred and thirty pounds madam said he

She produced her notes Pray count it yourself We have been delayed in
the same manner ourselves My husband is a great invalid but I was not
so fortunate as to get someone to refund us our passagemoney

What name did you say asked the clerk counting Mr and Mrs Carr
Thank you and he handed her the slip of paper

Thank you said Sarah with a bewitching smile and swept down to
her cab again John Rex was gnawing his nails in sullen apathy She
displayed the passageticket You are saved By the time Mr Francis
Wade gets his wits together and his sister recovers her speech we
shall be past pursuit

To Sydney cries Rex angrily looking at the warrant Why there of
all places in Gods earth

Sarah surveyed him with an expression of contempt Because your scheme
has failed Now this is mine You have deserted me once you will do so
again in any other country You are a murderer a villain and a coward
but you suit me I save you but I mean to keep you I will bring you to
Australia where the first trooper will arrest you at my bidding as an
escaped convict If you dont like to come stay behind I dont care
I am rich I have done no wrong The law cannot touch meDo you agree
Then tell the man to drive to Silvers in Cornhill for your outfit

Having housed him at lastall gloomy and despondentin a quiet tavern
near the railway station she tried to get some information as to this
last revealed crime

How came you to kill Lord Bellasis she asked him quietly

I had found out from my mother that I was his natural son and one
day riding home from a pigeon match I told him so He taunted meand I
struck him I did not mean to kill him but he was an old man and in my
passion I struck hard As he fell I thought I saw a horseman among the
trees and I galloped off My illluck began then for the same night I
was arrested at the coiners

But I thought there was robbery said she

Not by me But for Gods sake talk no more about it I am sickmy
brain is going round I want to sleep

Be careful please Lift him gently said Mrs Carr as the boat
ranged alongside the Dido gaunt and grim in the early dawn of a bleak
May morning

Whats the matter asked the officer of the watch perceiving the
bustle in the boat

Gentleman seems to have had a stroke said a boatman

It was so There was no fear that John Rex would escape again from the
woman he had deceived The infernal genius of Sarah Purfoy had saved
her lover at lastbut saved him only that she might nurse him till he
dieddied ignorant even of her tenderness a mere animal lacking the
intellect he had in his selfish wickedness abused




CHAPTER XVII THE REDEMPTION



     

That is my story Let it plead with you to turn you from your
purpose and to save her The punishment of sin falls not upon the
sinner only A deed once done lives in its consequence for ever and
this tragedy of shame and crime to which my felons death is a fitting
end is but the outcome of a selfish sin like yours

It had grown dark in the prison and as he ceased speaking Rufus Dawes
felt a trembling hand seize his own It was that of the chaplain

Let me hold your handSir Richard Devine did not murder your father
He was murdered by a horseman who riding with him struck him and
fled

Merciful God How do you know this

Because I saw the murder committed becausedont let go my handI
robbed the body

You

In my youth I was a gambler Lord Bellasis won money from me and
to pay him I forged two bills of exchange Unscrupulous and cruel he
threatened to expose me if I did not give him double the sum Forgery
was death in those days and I strained every nerve to buy back the
proofs of my folly I succeeded I was to meet Lord Bellasis near his
own house at Hampstead on the night of which you speak to pay the money
and receive the bills When I saw him fall I galloped up but instead
of pursuing his murderer I rifled his pocketbook of my forgeries I was
afraid to give evidence at the trial or I might have saved youAh
you have let go my hand

God forgive you said Rufus Dawes and then was silent

Speak cried North Speak or you will make me mad Reproach me
Spurn me Spit upon me You cannot think worse of me than I do myself
But the other his head buried in his hands did not answer and with a
wild gesture North staggered out of the cell

Nearly an hour had passed since the chaplain had placed the rum flask in
his hand and Gimblett observed with semidrunken astonishment that it
was not yet empty He had intended in the first instance to have taken
but one sup in payment of his courtesyfor Gimblett was conscious of
his own weakness in the matter of strong watersbut as he waited and
waited the one sup became two and two three and at length more than
half the contents of the bottle had moistened his gullet and maddened
him for more Gimblett was in a quandary If he didnt finish the flask
he would be oppressed with an everlasting regret If he did finish it he
would be drunk and to be drunk on duty was the one unpardonable sin He
looked across the darkness of the sea to where the rising and falling
light marked the schooner The Commandant was a long way off A faint
breeze which hadaccording to Blunts prophecyarisen with the night
brought up to him the voices of the boats crew from the jetty below
him His friend Jack Mannix was coxswain of her He would give Jack
a drink Leaving the gate he advanced unsteadily to the edge of the
embankment and putting his head over called out to his friend The
breeze however which was momentarily freshening carried his voice
away and Jack Mannix hearing nothing continued his conversation
Gimblett was just drunk enough to be virtuously indignant at this
incivility and seating himself on the edge of the bank swallowed
the remainder of the rum at a draught The effect upon his enforcedly
temperate stomach was very touching He made one feeble attempt to get
upon his legs cast a reproachful glance at the rum bottle essayed
to drink out of its spirituous emptiness and then with a smile of
reckless contentment cursed the island and all its contents and fell
asleep



North coming out of the prison did not notice the absence of
the gaoler indeed he was not in a condition to notice anything
Bareheaded without his cloak with staring eyes and clenched hands he
rushed through the gates into the night as one who flies headlong from
some fearful vision It seemed that absorbed in his own thoughts he
took no heed of his steps for instead of taking the path which led to
the sea he kept along the more familiar one that led to his own cottage
on the hill This man a convict he cried He is a heroa martyr
What a life Love Yes that is love indeed Oh James North how
base art thou in the eyes of God beside this despised outcast And so
muttering tearing his grey hair and beating his throbbing temples with
clenched hands he reached his own room and saw by the light of the
newborn moon the dressingbag and candle standing on the table as he
had left them They brought again to his mind the recollection of the
task that was before him He lighted the candle and taking the bag in
his hand cast one last look round the chamber which had witnessed his
futile struggles against that baser part of himself which had at last
triumphed It was so Fate had condemned him to sin and he must now
fulfil the doom he might once have averted Already he fancied he could
see the dim speck that was the schooner move slowly away from the prison
shore He must not linger they would be waiting for him at the jetty
As he turned the moonbeamsas yet unobscured by the rapidly gathering
cloudsflung a silver streak across the sea and across that streak
North saw a boat pass Was his distracted brain playing him falsein
the stern sat wrapped in a cloak the figure of a man A fierce gust
of wind drove the searack over the moon and the boat disappeared as
though swallowed up by the gathering storm North staggered back as the
truth struck him

He remembered how he had said I will redeem him with my own blood
Was it possible that a just Heaven had thus decided to allow the man
whom a coward had condemned to escape and to punish the coward who
remained Oh this man deserved freedom he was honest noble truthful
How different from himselfa hateful selflover an unchaste priest
a drunkard The lookingglass in which the saintly face of Meekin was
soon to be reflected stood upon the table and North peering into it
with one hand mechanically thrust into the bag started in insane rage
at the pale face and bloodshot eyes he saw there What a hateful wretch
he had become The last fatal impulse of insanity which seeks relief
from its own hideous self came upon him and his fingers closed
convulsively upon the object they had been seeking

It is better so he muttered addressing with fixed eyes his own
detested image I have examined you long enough I have read your
heart and written out your secrets You are but a shellthe shell that
holds a corrupted and sinful heart He shall live you shall die The
rapid motion of his arm overturned the candle and all was dark



Rufus Dawes overpowered by the revelation so suddenly made to him had
remained for a few moments motionless in his cell expecting to hear
the heavy clang of the outer door which should announce to him the
departure of the chaplain But he did not hear it and it seemed to him
that the air in the cell had grown suddenly cooler He went to the
door and looked into the narrow corridor expecting to see the scowling
countenance of Gimblett To his astonishment the door of the prison was
wide open and not a soul in sight His first thought was of North
Had the story he had told coupled with the entreaties he had lavished
sufficed to turn him from his purpose

He looked around The night was falling suddenly the wind was mounting
from beyond the bar came the hoarse murmur of an angry sea If the
schooner was to sail that night she had best get out into deep waters
Where was the chaplain Pray Heaven the delay had been sufficient and
they had sailed without him Yet they would be sure to meet He advanced
a few steps nearer and looked about him Was it possible that in his
madness the chaplain had been about to commit some violence which had
drawn the trusty Gimblett from his post Grrrr Ouph The trusty
Gimblett was lying at his feetdead drunk

Hi Hiho Hillo there roared somebody from the jetty below Be that
you Muster Noarth We aint too much tiam sur

From the uncurtained windows of the chaplains house on the hill beamed
the newlylighted candle They in the boat did not see it but it
brought to the prisoner a wild hope that made his heart bound He ran
back to the cell clapped on Norths wideawake and flinging the cloak
hastily about him came quickly down the steps If the moon should shine
out now

Jump in sir said unsuspecting Mannix thinking only of the flogging
he had been threatened with Itll be a dirty night this night Put
this over your knees sir Shove her off Give way And they were
afloat But one glimpse of moonlight fell upon the slouched hat and
cloaked figure and the boats crew engaged in the dangerous task of
navigating the reef in the teeth of the rising gale paid no attention
to the chaplain

By George lads were but just in time cried Mannix and they laid
alongside the schooner black in blackness Up ye go yer honour
quick The wind had shifted and was now off the shore Blunt who had
begun to repent of his obstinacy but would not confess it thought the
next best thing to riding out the gale was to get out to open sea Damn
the parson he had said in all heartiness we cant wait all night
for him Heave ahead Mr Johnson And so the anchor was atrip as Rufus
Dawes ran up the side

The Commandant already pulling off in his own boat roared a coarse
farewell Goodbye North It was touch and go with ye adding Curse
the fellow hes too proud to answer

The chaplain indeed spoke to no one and plunging down the hatchway
made for the stern cabins Close shave your reverence said a
respectful somebody opening a door It was but the clergyman did not
say so He doublelocked the door and hardly realizing the danger he
had escaped flung himself on the bunk panting Over his head he heard
the rapid tramp of feet and the cheery

Yo hioh and a rumbelow

of the men at the capstan He could smell the sea and through the open
window of the cabin could distinguish the light in the chaplains house
on the hill The trampling ceased the vessel began to move slowlythe
Commandants boat appeared below him for an instant making her way
backthe Lady Franklin had set sail With his eyes fixed on the tiny
light he strove to think what was best to be done It was hopeless
to think that he could maintain the imposture which favoured by the
darkness and confusion he had hitherto successfully attempted He was
certain to be detected at Hobart Town even if he could lie concealed
during his long and tedious voyage That mattered little however He
had saved Sylvia for North had been left behind Poor North As
the thought of pity came to him the light he looked at was suddenly
extinguished and Rufus Dawes compelled thereto as by an irresistible
power fell upon his knees and prayed for the pardon and happiness of
the man who had redeemed him


     


Thats a gun from the shore said Partridge the mate and theyre
burning a red light Theres a prisoner escaped Shall we lieto

Lieto cried old Blunt with a tremendous oath Well have suthin
else to do Look there

The sky to the northward was streaked with a belt of livid green colour
above which rose a mighty black cloud whose shape was ever changing




CHAPTER XVIII THE CYCLONE



Blunt recognising the meteoric heralds of danger had begun to regret
his obstinacy He saw that a hurricane was approaching



Along the south coast of the Australian continent though the usual
westerly winds and gales of the highest latitudes prevail during the
greater portion of the year hurricanes are not infrequent Gales
commence at NW with a low barometer increasing at W and SW and
gradually veering to the south True cyclones occur at New Zealand
The log of the Adelaide for 29th February 1870 describes one which
travelled at the rate of ten miles an hour and had all the veerings
calm centre etc of a true tropical hurricane Now a cyclone occurring
off the west coast of New Zealand would travel from the New Hebrides
where such storms are hideously frequent and envelop Norfolk Island
passing directly across the track of vessels coming from South America
to Sydney It was one of these rotatory storms an escaped tempest of
the tropics which threatened the Lady Franklin



The ominous calm which had brooded over the island during the day
had given place to a smart breeze from the northeast and though the
schooner had been sheltered at her anchorage under the lee of the island
the harbour looked nearly due south when once fairly out to sea
Blunt saw it would be impossible to put back in the teeth of the gale
Haply however the full fury of the storm would not overtake them till
they had gained searoom

Rufus Dawes exhausted with the excitement through which he had passed
had slept for two or three hours when he was awakened by the motion
of the vessel going on the other tack He rose to his feet and found
himself in complete darkness Overhead was the noise of trampling feet
and he could distinguish the hoarse tones of Blunt bellowing orders
Astonished at the absence of the moonlight which had so lately silvered
the sea he flung open the cabin window and looked out As we have said
the cabin allotted to North was one of the two stern cabins and from it
the convict had a full view of the approaching storm

The sight was one of wild grandeur The huge black cloud which hung in
the horizon had changed its shape Instead of a curtain it was an arch
Beneath this vast and magnificent portal shone a dull phosphoric
light Across this livid space pale flashes of sheetlightning passed
noiselessly Behind it was a dull and threatening murmur made up of the
grumbling of thunder the falling of rain and the roar of contending
wind and water The lights of the prisonisland had disappeared so
rapid had been the progress of the schooner under the steady breeze and
the ocean stretched around black and desolate Gazing upon this gloomy
expanse Rufus Dawes observed a strange phenomenonlightning appeared
to burst upwards from the sullen bosom of the sea At intervals the
darklyrolling waves flashed fire and streaks of flame shot upwards
The wind increased in violence and the arch of light was fringed
with rain A dull red glow hung around like the reflection of a
conflagration Suddenly a tremendous peal of thunder accompanied by
a terrific downfall of rain rattled along the sky The arch of light
disappeared as though some invisible hand had shut the slide of a giant
lantern A great wall of water rushed roaring over the level plain of
the sea and with an indescribable medley of sounds in which tones
of horror triumph and torture were blended the cyclone swooped upon
them

Rufus Dawes comprehended that the elements had come to save or destroy
him In that awful instant the natural powers of the man rose equal
to the occasion In a few hours his fate would be decided and it was
necessary that he should take all precaution One of two events seemed
inevitable he would either be drowned where he lay or should the
vessel weather the storm he would be forced upon the deck and the
desperate imposture he had attempted be discovered For the moment
despair overwhelmed him and he contemplated the raging sea as though
he would cast himself into it and thus end his troubles The tones of
a womans voice recalled him to himself Cautiously unlocking the cabin
door he peered out The cuddy was lighted by a swinging lamp which
revealed Sylvia questioning one of the women concerning the storm As
Rufus Dawes looked he saw her glance with an air half of hope half
of fear towards the door behind which he lurked and he understood that
she expected to see the chaplain Locking the door he proceeded hastily
to dress himself in Norths clothes He would wait until his aid was
absolutely required and then rush out In the darkness Sylvia would
mistake him for the priest He could convey her to the boatif recourse
to the boats should be rendered necessaryand then take the hazard of
his fortune While she was in danger his place was near by



From the deck of the vessel the scene was appalling The clouds had
closed in The arch of light had disappeared and all was a dull
windy blackness Gigantic seas seemed to mount in the horizon and sweep
towards and upon them It was as though the ship lay in the vortex of
a whirlpool so high on either side of her were piled the rough
pyramidical masses of sea Mighty gusts aroseclaps of wind which
seemed like strokes of thunder A sail loosened from its tackling was
torn away and blown out to sea disappearing like a shred of white paper
to leeward The mercury in the barometer marked 2950 Blunt who had
been at the rum bottle swore great oaths that no soul on board would
see another sun and when Partridge rebuked him for blasphemy at such a
moment wept spirituous tears

The howling of the wind was benumbing the very fury of sound enfeebled
while it terrified The sailors horrorstricken crawled about the
deck clinging to anything they thought most secure It was impossible
to raise the head to look to windward The eyelids were driven together
and the face stung by the swift and biting spray Men breathed this
atmosphere of salt and wind and became sickened Partridge felt that
orders were uselessthe man at his elbow could not have heard them The
vessel lay almost on her beam ends with her helm up stripped even of
the sails which had been furled upon the yards Mortal hands could do
nothing for her

By five oclock in the morning the gale had reached its height The
heavens showered out rain and lightningsrain which the wind blew
away before it reached the ocean lightnings which the ravenous and
mountainous waves swallowed before they could pierce the gloom The ship
lay over on her side held there by the madly rushing wind which seemed
to flatten down the sea cutting off the top of the waves and breaking
them into fine white spray which covered the ocean like a thick
cloud as high as the topmast heads Each gust seemed unsurpassable in
intensity but was succeeded after a pause that was not a lull but a
gasp by one of more frantic violence The barometer stood at 2782 The
ship was a mere labouring crazy wreck that might sink at any moment
At halfpast three oclock the barometer had fallen to 2762 Save when
lighted by occasional flashes of sheetlightning which showed to the
cowed wretches their awestricken faces this tragedy of the elements
was performed in a darkness which was almost palpable

Suddenly the mercury rose to 2990 and with one awful shriek the
wind dropped to a calm The Lady Franklin had reached the centre of the
cyclone Partridge glancing to where the great body of drunken Blunt
rolled helplessly lashed to the wheel felt a strange selfish joy thrill
him If the ship survived the drunken captain would be dismissed and
he Partridge the gallant would reign in his stead The schooner no
longer steadied by the wind was at the mercy of every sea Volumes of
water poured over her Presently she heeled over for with a triumphant
scream the wind leapt on to her from a fresh quarter Following its
usual course the storm returned upon its track The hurricane was about
to repeat itself from the northwest

The sea pouring down through the burst hatchway tore the door of
the cuddy from its hinges Sylvia found herself surrounded by a
wildlysurging torrent which threatened to overwhelm her She shrieked
aloud for aid but her voice was inaudible even to herself Clinging to
the mast which penetrated the little cuddy she fixed her eyes upon the
door behind which she imagined North was and whispered a last prayer
for succour The door opened and from out the cabin came a figure clad
in black She looked up and the light of the expiring lamp showed her a
face that was not that of the man she hoped to see Then a pair of dark
eyes beaming ineffable love and pity were bent upon her and a pair of
dripping arms held her above the brine as she had once been held in the
misty mysterious days that were gone

In the terror of that moment the cloud which had so long oppressed her
brain passed from it The action of the strange man before her completed
and explained the action of the convict chained to the Port
Arthur coalwagons of the convict kneeling in the Norfolk Island
torturechamber She remembered the terrible experience of Macquarie
Harbour She recalled the evening of the boatbuilding when swung
into the air by stalwart arms she had promised the rescuing prisoner to
plead for him with her kindred Regaining her memory thus all the agony
and shame of the mans long life of misery became at once apparent to
her She understood how her husband had deceived her and with what base
injustice and falsehood he had bought her young love No question as to
how this doublycondemned prisoner had escaped from the hideous isle of
punishment she had quitted occurred to her She asked noteven in her
thoughtshow it had been given to him to supplant the chaplain in his
place on board the vessel She only considered in her sudden awakening
the story of his wrongs remembered only his marvellous fortitude and
love knew only in this last instant of her pure illfated life that
as he had saved her once from starvation and death so had he come again
to save her from sin and from despair Whoever has known a deadly peril
will remember how swiftly thought then travelled back through scenes
clean forgotten and will understand how Sylvias retrospective vision
merged the past into the actual before her how the shock of recovered
memory subsided in the grateful utterance of other daysGood Mr
Dawes

The eyes of the man and woman met in one long wild gaze Sylvia
stretched out her white hands and smiled and Richard Devine understood
in his turn the story of the young girls joyless life and knew how she
had been sacrificed

In the great crisis of our life when brought face to face with
annihilation we are suspended gasping over the great emptiness of
death we become conscious that the Self which we think we knew so well
has strange and unthoughtof capacities To describe a tempest of
the elements is not easy but to describe a tempest of the soul is
impossible Amid the fury of such a tempest a thousand memories each
bearing in its breast the corpse of some dead deed whose influence
haunts us yet are driven like feathers before the blast as
unsubstantial and as unregarded The mists which shroud our
selfknowledge become transparent and we are smitten with sudden
lightninglike comprehension of our own misused power over our fate

This much we feel and know but who can coldly describe the hurricane
which thus oerwhelms him As well ask the drowned mariner to tell
of the marvels of midsea when the great deeps swallowed him and the
darkness of death encompassed him round about These two human beings
felt that they had done with life Together thus alone in the very
midst and presence of death the distinctions of the world they were
about to leave disappeared Then vision grew clear They felt as beings
whose bodies had already perished and as they clasped hands their freed
souls recognizing each the loveliness of the other rushed tremblingly
together

Borne before the returning whirlwind an immense wave which glimmered
in the darkness spouted up and towered above the wreck The wretches
who yet clung to the deck looked shuddering up into the bellying
greenness and knew that the end was come



END OF BOOK THE FOURTH




EPILOGUE

 At daydawn the morning after the storm
 the rays of the rising sun fell upon an
 object which floated on the surface of
 the water not far from where the schooner
 had foundered

 This object was a portion of the mainmast
 head of the Lady Franklin and entangled
 in the rigging were two corpsesa man
 and a woman The arms of the man were
 clasped round the body of the woman
 and her head lay on his breast
 The Prison Island appeared but as a long
 low line on the distant horizon
 The tempest was over As the sun rose
 higher the air grew balmy the ocean placid
 and golden in the rays of the new risen
 morning the wreck and its burden drifted
 out to sea

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
